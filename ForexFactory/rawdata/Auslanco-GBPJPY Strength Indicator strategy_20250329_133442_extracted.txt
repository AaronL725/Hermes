Hi guys...I'm trying to put up the much needed strategy rules for my system. Lesson-1 First I will introduce you to the two main indicators I use for my trading. It's safe to place trades just by using these two indicators after you confirm a trade according to the strategy rules. a. The strength Indicator b. TFT line For VT Trader users: S trength Indicator = Quantitative Qualitative Estimation Indicator ( Smoothing period 5) Please go to indicator properties and add a red line on the value 50. Go to color /style on the same indicator properties and turn the LevelRSIfast to white(invisible).... TFT = Gann HiLo Activator (period/value 10) Free charting package VT trader- free www.vtsystems.com Time frames 4hr,1hr Check list before enter a trade: Buy signal A). 4hr chart: First confirm the 4hr Strength indicator has turned bullish( This can be either below or above the 50 line) Please note that the 4hr strength indicator doesn't have to cross over to the 50 line. B). 4hr chart: Make sure the candle has formed above the TFT line. now once you confirm the above two features you know the short-medium term trend is bullish. Entry: C). 1hr charts: you only enter @ the point of the strength indicator cross over the 50 line upwards. If you find that 1hr SI is way above the 50 line by the time you get a cross over confirmation from 4hr, that means a major retracement is due. please wait untill the 1hr SI turn bearish and go back to bullish again to enter. d). 1hr Charts: Make sure a candle has formed above the TFT line. Always enter @ the start of 1hr confirmation bar(second bar after the TFT crossover bar )

Please note that the Sell signals are vise versa. I will keep updating more graphics and examples in the near future. Please practice these indicator behaviors on a demo account before you apply them on to your real money trading .

Current charts as of Sunday 5th August @ 2.53GMT (10.53EST) 4hr strength indicator still hasn't crossed down to bearish. 1 hr crossed down below the 50 line. Both 1hr &amp; 4hr price bars are below the TFT line Interpretation: When I get my new chart updates on Monday Asian session I would expect the 4hr Strength Indicator to be crossed down. But the 1hr Strength indicator is way below the 50 line .My usual entry point is when the strength indicator cross @the 50 line on 1hr charts, providing that 4hr strength indicator has turned bearish already.. There for I will wait until the 1hr strength indicator cross upwards and cross downward again before I enter.. as there could be a retracemnt around to 241.40 area @ asian early to mid hours before it starts a bearish rally.

The link in post one to free vt systems does not work

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Just corrected it

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi Auslanco, Were you just using these indicators in the past days? No need for MACD, Momentum etc?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Auslanco, The vtsystem link you posted still don't work. I am using the broker: www.cmsfx.com , and they are providing VT trader, too. Name sound the same, but I wnat to make sure that is the same VT you are using.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Aus I am having trouble getting the link to work as well Cheers

4Hr Strength Indicator: crossed down (but the confirmation bar has not yet formed -next bar) 4Hr TFT: price is below the TFT line 1Hr Strength Indicator: Crossed down but way below the 50 line 1Hr TFT: the new bar is Way below the TFT line Interpretation: Since the 1Hr S.I is way below the 50 line(my entry point is @ the 50 line crossing) I will wait until the 1hr SI cross upwards(retracement) and as it crosses back down again I may go short(if the 4hr SI is still crossed down). We will have an awesome short (Sell) day today with a guaranteed 300 pips since the daily momentum and trend is extremely bearish.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi brok.. No need of any extra indicators..Once you master these two indicators , You can use the other indicators (Stoch, Momentum etc etc ) just to confirm what you see. But S.I and TFT are the main two indicators

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Here's the link again Guys, (for the free VT trader charting platform ) www.vtsystems.com or www.cmsfx.com

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Yess,, they are all built in (free) with VT

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Here's a great source to learn about candlestick patterns if you are interested http://www.actionforex.com/articles_..._200605107114/

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Dear Auslanco, I downloaded VT Navigator trading station, but I don't see "Strength Indicator". Where do you get that? Thanks, Michael

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Please read the very first post: it's called QQE

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Ok, got it. Thanks http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Auslanco Question do you trade with VT or just use their charts?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Auslanco, This looks GREAT and SIMPLE. Thanks for sharing your system in this seperate thread. Much easier than following earlier post to try to find.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Just use their charts

--- 帖子 #24 ---
It is very simple and very profitable.. just have to get use to the indicator behavior a little bit.. then you are done

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Aus, I only find QQE (Estimation) in my VT. Is it the same with QQI you mentioned?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Yes it's the same.. sorry it was my mistake.. It's QQE

--- 帖子 #27 ---
What are the comparable indicators for Metetrader?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Auslanco, Thanks for this thread. It will help each of us interested in improving our trading skills using your system. Much to learn. Dr. D.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Aus, is it only applicable for GJ only or can be applied to other pair also such as GU or EU ?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
What target price and protective stop do you use?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
If Daily+4Hr+1Hr strength Indicators pointing at the same direction=TP target of 300 pips If only 4hr+1hr strength Indicators pointing to the same direction= TP200 pips target Stop Loss: aprox:100 pips from the 1hr , 50line crossover price.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Can you give an estimate of the percentage of winning trades vs. losers?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Auslanco Are you using this system on other pairs also? If yes, have you found it wotk better or best with GY? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
what is the percentage of losses this system makes? how is the exit signal? when do you move to breakeven?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I think he said that he moves sl after 100 pips to be locked in profit

--- 帖子 #36 ---
what is the percentage of losses and the exit signal?, thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I'll take it as a question addresed to me: he said that when he enters a transaction he is like 90% sure that it will go inhis favor, and after this 2 weeks I came to beleive him...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
thanks a lot ovidiu, you are very kind, and how is the exit signal like? do we keep in the trade even if the qqe has crossed back ?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
the exit signal is based on the entry point 200 pips after second 1hr confirmation bar, if the trend is only on 1H and 4H, but if the daily is with us you can go more than 200 pips, and yes you keep ur trade even if 1hr QQE crosse back, only with 4H is more triky that signals a trend change so probably that would be an exit signal, that's how far that I know but I am still learning

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Is this strategy good for all pairs or only works on G/J?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
VT Trader???? wowow... must be learn first.... but thks auslanco i will follow and try ur metode...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
does anyone have templates for for all time frame charts? can someone please post it. Thank you

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Auslanco, I sent you a PM. Please check. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
AUS, I have found the QQE and set it up on MT4 (it has many more lines than yours and I am not sure which one you use (5 only with the 50))? I can't find the TFT indicator on MT4. Do you know if there is another one similar to it? Thanks again

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yeah ,I join the question... Many of us use MT4 , and the new charting program is very confusing for some of us

--- 帖子 #46 ---
At 4 PM EST, both the 4 hr has been crossed to the upside and the 1 hr has crossed to the upside below 50. Pursuant to your rules target should be 200 pips from entry with stop of approximately 100 pips. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Nevermind Aus.. I got the VT system running and now have my charts looking just like your examples. QUESTION: Are you using the VT_Level Stop Reverse template? If so with default values? Thanks again much!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
ive only just started looking at this system, but i think the 1hr has to cross the 50. its the 4 hr that does not have to cross 50. as long as the 4 hr is in a bullish position.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Bill777, I just reread the first posts. I think you are right. The 1 hour has to cross 50.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
so according to this system,last entry long would have been at 240.18 aprox, with target 200 pips?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
240.30.. H1 2100EST bar (5sma)

--- 帖子 #52 ---
thanks aus, i see it clearly now, what for do you use the 5sma?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I eneter from 5sma.. after it crosses.. So you dont get caugt to fake spikes

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Real trade results..

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Real trade results...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
thanks aus, this trade is a nice set up, very clear and takes profit very well thanks to the news that was in favour of it, could you please show us a loss, how would it be? maybe the previous trade a short if i remember when 4hrs and 1hr agreed on monday, we were expecting a 300 pips profit and it turned back, i am very happy for this trade that fulfilled the profits expected but i am very interested in looking a loss, how it would like, thanks.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Aus, I saw that last night as well. Now that we have a 4H SI cross at the 50, would you think that a retrace to the 1H 5 SMA might be a good long (assuming other SI indicators agree)? I see 30 min and 1 hr well above 50, but the day is now turned up and the 4H crossing may just give me the go ahead once the 1H hits the 5 SMA. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Very interesting strategy

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Is there any way to convert these indicators to MT4 platform. My computer is getting kinda slow with all this down loading. Thank you

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi cesande, just want to make sure about one thing, 5sma is the red line on the 50 where the strength chart is. is this corect. any one can answer this for me i will apreciate it.........bill77

--- 帖子 #61 ---
HI biill, 5sma is the blue line go along with the price bars..5sma is the tru price of the market. when you enter you have to entre the market when the price is on 5sma or closeset as possible.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Anyone have the indicators for MT4 for this system? I would love to try this system but prefer sticking with MT4.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
me too

--- 帖子 #64 ---
This indicator looks pretty close but may need some testing to confirm. you will also have to tweak the lines and ma colors you want shown. enjoy

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I could not find all the indicators and had to run VT side by side with MT4 now.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Anyone who knows to write an indicator please write this QQE for MT4. QQE VTtrader Source: {RSI} rsi_r := (CLOSE - ref(CLOSE,-1)); rsi_rs := Wilders(if(rsi_r&gt;0,rsi_r,0),14) / Wilders(if(rsi_r&lt;0,Abs(rsi_r),0),14); RSIndex:= Mov((100-(100/(1+rsi_rs))),SF,E); {ATR RSI} TH :=if(Ref(RSIndex,-1) &gt; RSIndex,Ref(RSIndex,-1),RSIndex); TL :=if(Ref(RSIndex,-1) &lt; RSIndex,Ref(RSIndex,-1),RSIndex); TR :=TH-TL; ATRRSI:=Wilders(TR,14); DeltaATRRSI:= Wilders(ATRRSI,14)*2.618; TrLevelRSIFast:=If( RSIndex=PREV, PREV, If( ((Ref(RSIndex,-1)&lt;PREV)AND (RSIndex&lt;PREV)), Min(PREV,RSIndex + DeltaATRRSI), If( (Ref(RSIndex,-1)&gt;PREV) AND (RSIndex&gt;PREV), Max(PREV,RSIndex - DeltaATRRSI), If( RSIndex&gt;PREV, RSIndex - DeltaATRRSI, RSIndex + DeltaATRRSI ) ) ) ); DeltaATRRSI_2:= Wilders(ATRRSI,14)*4.236; TrLevelRSISlow:=If( RSIndex=PREV, PREV, If( ((Ref(RSIndex,-1)&lt;PREV)AND (RSIndex&lt;PREV)), Min(PREV,RSIndex + DeltaATRRSI_2), If( (Ref(RSIndex,-1)&gt;PREV) AND (RSIndex&gt;PREV), Max(PREV,RSIndex - DeltaATRRSI_2), If( RSIndex&gt;PREV, RSIndex - DeltaATRRSI_2, RSIndex + DeltaATRRSI_2 ) ) ) );

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Brok, it may be better if you post your request in the MetaTrader indicators section. I did get the demo with VT, but I would prefer to use only MetaTrader also. Cheers Pluto2

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Aus, I asked this question on the GBPJPY thread and got chastised for asking about other pairs on that thread, although it happens often ??? Anyway, would you say that your strategy works as well for other pairs? I saw a very nice setup on the GBPCHF today and was just wondering if I can or should apply what I have learned from you to other pairs. I see the setup at 8/13/2007 at 12:00 on VT time. Day seems flat 4Hr SI pointing up, crossed, and below the 50 1 Hr SI crossed 50 up Now waiting for price to retrace to 50 5sma for an entry. Since we don't have the day SI with us, I am thinking 200-300 range up. Any thoughts??? Reply greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
In my experience this can be applied to any pair you wish

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Also note that today a GBPUSD short trade was successful...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Appears that both crossed to the upside on the 4 hr on 8/12 at 1600 VT time and the 1 hour on both were above 50 at the time. The 1 hour on both has crossed below 50 while the 4 hr remains crossed to the upside so that it appears if the 1 hour crosses above 50 and the 4 hr remains crossed to the upside there may be a potential long trade. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I guess we also have to wait the price close above the H4 and H1 TFT(Gann Hi Lo) for long then we have the potential 200 pips long trade

--- 帖子 #74 ---
MT4 indicators I had coded about 9 months ago.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Cool stuff, thanks!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Please note: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=7829

--- 帖子 #77 ---
mades the indicators are above in my post also. I also provided the source/mq4 and not only the ex4 like the link you provided.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
didnt know that those were the same ones, naming is different. But in this case, you should deserve the credit and thanks alot for your work!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
thank you very much for your work

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Nice work!. Thanks a lot. Can I just ask: According to the VT rules, one of the lines og QQE has to be erased. Which one would it be here? The Maron or the Black one?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
None of the lines have to be erased if you use the indicators I posted.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
thanx creztor for the indicators

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Delete the fast one- no color I mean

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi I think this is a great system, can anyone create an indicator that can alert via email? So when the SI turns on the 4 hour and the candle closes above the TFT we get a mail in either direction respective? Any comments?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Creztor, thanks so much for the indicators. You have obviously eliminated the Fast RSI and done all the settings according to Auslanco. So, no work at all for us. Just import the indicators and leave them as they are. Fantastic! You deserve many positive trades for this effort and for sharing it with us. What goes around comes around. Thanks again. Regards, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Saw it now. Thanks

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Yes the ones I made have a lot of extra things like MTF and alerts. Posting source is nice, but we had a few people involved, and I am not about to give someone elses code to random people on a forum.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
We are so lucky that people like Creztor are members of this forum! Cheers, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Auslanco gave his trading method to a lot of random people on a forum, he didn't have to share his idea/method on using the QQE and Hi-Lo trading, but he did and continues to do so. I do realize and know that he got the idea of using the indicators from another site which was charging for them, but he came up with a much better way of using them (much better than the original site which in no way really offered anyway of trading with them).

--- 帖子 #90 ---
What does that have to do with me handing over source code that a couple of my co-workers helped develop without there permission? If you do not understand that concept, not much else I can say. Fact is, the indicators work weather or not you can see the source. It's your choice if you want to use it or not.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Im sure they have the mq4 I posted now and are looking through it seeing if they can make use of it though.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I do not think they care, we work for a software develpoment company. I however did look at your code, and the Gann is wrong while the QQE is missing a lot of useful features. Nothing there useful (And if you look at any indicators I have ever produced (All mq4's) I have sited sources for any code I find useful. This code is not all mine, and it has not been agreed to release the source. Besides, you can not distribute opensource code, and then complain when someone looks at it. If you do not want your intelectual property pried into, do not distribute open source.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Also, SSL: #property copyright "Kalenzo" #property link " bartlomiej.gorski@gmail.com " QQE: #property copyright "Copyright 200 Roman Ignatov" #property link " mailto:roman.ignatov@gmail.com " Made by different people. This is exactly why my people are hesitant.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi Que I find this indicator and it works veri similar as SI. may you check it? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I am not sure what you want me to do with this. Do you want me to tell you what it does? On Default: Makes 2 Arrays -One (Array 1) of the Current Closing Price minus the Previous Closing Price -One (Array 2)of the above but absolute value (If its negitive make it a positive value) Then It takes those Arrays and makes them into new Moving Average Arrays. So: Array 1 is calculated as an Exponential Moving Average over the last 8 entries in Array 1 and becomes Array 3 Array 2 is calculated as an Exponential Moving Average over the last 8 entries in Array 2 and becomes Array 4 Then it It takes those Arrays and makes them into new Moving Average Arrays Again. So: Array 3 is calculated as an Exponential Moving Average over the last 5 entries in Array 3 and becomes Array 5 Array 4 is calculated as an Exponential Moving Average over the last 5 entries in Array 4 and becomes Array 6 Then It makes a New Array (This is first Visible line). So: It takes the Current entry in Array 5 and multiplies it by 100. It then takes that value and devides it by the current entry in Array 6. This Creates Array 7. Then It creates one last Array (Other visible line) Using the values in Array 7. So: Array 7 is calculated as an Smooth Moving Average (But this is changable by the user) over the last 5 entries in Array 7 and becomes Array 8 This is not QQE even though it looks simular on the chart.

These are the ones I posted for those who missed it on the other thread. No experation.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Tx Que. That was so kind from your side. vAL144

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thank you! very good work both for the indicators I put templates here with Que indicators.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Glad you can open the files. Feel free to contact them and ask who paid them to do these indicators

--- 帖子 #101 ---
New Indicators. Fixes: -The Slow Line was not displaying because I accidentally commented it out while testing on the old version. Now just change the color to None if you do not want it to display. Several people however, do want it to display. The Maroon one is the one to make None if you do not want both lines. - Now the Gann HiLo shows the value in the chart screen. - Now the QQE shows the values of all 3 lines in the chart screen. ###NOTE###: You do not need these new indicators if you 1. Do not need the numbers to display in the top left of the indicator window 2. You do not need the third line.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Working on MTF. There seems to be a bug with it and I do not know what yet. Looking into it now.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Que glad you emailed the programmers I paid to ask about the copyright of the indicators

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Aye, And for the record, One of the programmers DID say he ported it over for you. I assume the other will say the same. As I stated, I work for a software house, and we have had our code pirated before and generally by companies in contries that do nothing about it. As a matter of fact, this just happened to us reciently and I am a little jumpy about it. Please accept my appologies Creztor.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Attached is the full set of indicators as well as a template and reasme file for beginners on how to install them. Included are: QQE indicator with Alerts Gann HiLo Indicator Momentum Indicator Auslanco Template to include all of the above as well as the SMA 5 line. All of the above indicators replicate the VT indicators exactly. So you can officially get rid of the VT platform if you wish to do so. Que.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Your work is highly apreciated! even if I am using both of the platforms now VT and MT, is better to have all of the charts on only one platform. I checked it out and it seems to be no differences that I can spot if I find any I'll let you know, I will still be using VT but in a smaller measure, for VT-Stop-Reversal System that also plays a key role in Auslanco's strat. Also very nice the alert that you introduced. We are all gratefull to you!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Please explain this stop reversal system.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
This morning I was walking a friend through the downloading process. He downloaded these two indicators to his MT4 indicator folder but they do not show up in the custom indicator file. He restarted his computer several times but still nothing. Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Que! Cetzor paid for this indicator, as I look in my email history I see that I created a few indicators for him. He is a good man, and he has a right to what ever he wants with this software. Cheers! Kale

--- 帖子 #110 ---
wow,,, speechless... thanks you.......

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Does this system only work with GBPJPY? Has anyone tried it with other pairs? Thank Jason

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I can only think the files were not properly placed in the correct folder. I am going to DL the attachment and try it on my computer to make sure. Will report back in a min.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I just downloaded the zip and extracted the items to there correct location, and they work just fine. He must be placing them in the wrong folder on this computer. Or he is looking at the Indicators and not the Custom Indicators.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Que, Man, you're the best. Patience of a saint. Thanks a million.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
This can work with any pair.. But choose your time frames carefully

--- 帖子 #116 ---
No problem Que. Hopefully if you guys find anyway to improve it that will be of benefit to those who want to use the indicators in their trading.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Que, thank you so much for your hard work. Would it be possible to develop an expert advisor (EA) for the strategy for atomated trading in MT4 or even VT (trading system)? Just a suggestion. Best regards. BR

--- 帖子 #118 ---
From what I remember you were saying that for GPBUSD if it were to trade it acording to your strat, you would use 4H for trend confirmation, and rely on 30 min for entry points, am I right? Or was it 1H, 4H for trend and 30min for entry, just give a hint. Thanks

--- 帖子 #119 ---
AUSLANCO rock ! hey man thanks or all of them i am also a junior i will work on ur indicators on this monday

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I couldn't explain it, all I know about it is that Asulanco uses a modified version of it to establish support/resistance levels. Here you have a link that explains the system: http://vtsystems.com/resources/helps...ual/index.html Unfortunately I don't know if we have the source code for it. Anyway just take a look at it.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
He could not find them in Indicators or Custom Indicators. I had no trouble downloading them. Perhaps he will work on it this week end. Thanks for you help. ( I told him he wasn't holding his tongue right.)

--- 帖子 #122 ---
hi Auslanco thanks for this nice thread and indicator i donwlod zip and extract it in my mt4 i set all things that u defined but i cant able to undrstand clearly i undrstand that : we buy 1. when 4H is bulish but not cross 50 line either above oe below and candle must above on tft line and second candle is confirmed if 1H is crossed to 50 line but 4hr not cross to its a time to retracement so we wait for bearish 1hr below on 50 line and after that again buy am i undrstand right plz tell me i am waiting

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Your question is not very clear.. If 1hr QQE cross the 50 line upwards but 4hr QQE is still bearish... to buy.. You have to wait until 4hr QQE cross upwards (above or below 50 line) and forms a bar above 4hr TFT. to sell... You ahve to wait untill 1hr QQE cross down and pass below 50 line .

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Here's some great work done by Que and creztor for MT4 users. Below is the screen shot from my FXDD MT4 charts. Note: The main indicators for this strategy are QQE/SI TFT/Gann hilow 5 SMA I use the other indicators as additional supporting indicators.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Here's a step by step guide to install the indicators on to your MT4 platform

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Last week I used same system for NZDUSD, worked out well, made good pips . Thank you very much Aus and Karmo and all others.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Much thanks for all your hard effort in providing this Que! Make things alot easier! Pipslovah

AUSLANCO'S RESPONSE FROM HIS MAIN THREAD: Momentum: I use the momentum indicator to catch the retracements after a big sudden price fall or rise. This indicator is accurate only on trending markets with high volumes. this is a very tricky indicator. I started using this indicator after studying it for almost 1 year on my demo account. Therefor it's not recommended for newbies to catch the retracement using this indicator as this could kill your account since you are going against the trend. You can Find more info on how to use the momentum indicator on the other GBP/JPY analysis thread. Once you learn &amp; confident on this indicator, It can be very useful to maximize your profits. For the last week 40% (over 1000 pips) of my profits came from this indicator. ADX: This is a additional indicator I use to confirm the trend .

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Auslanco, I can not get the "gann high low" indicator to show just a line. I did how ever find somewhere in one of our threads the "SSL" indicator which I think matchs more of what you are thinking in your previous post? Tell me what you think. Darn, I think I am getting closer to posting better charts. CRAP!!! the colors I mentioned "Yellow and Aqua" should be revirsed in the text on chart...sorry

Hi Kevin, You may have a different version of the indicators. I downloaded the indicators from the post 97.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Well then I guess I will just have to set up another chart with those indicators, not sure where I got mine but I got them from One of the thread family. They do look close to what is needed for mt4 don't they? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Momentum Indicator: This is not a must have indicator for this strategy. However, If you wish to find out more details on the momentum indicator please refer to the post # 9030 onwards on GBP/JPY analysis thread f or a description on retracements and how to use the momentum indicator.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Shoot!..lol.. I KNEW I was missing something on that chart, it is a new chart that I hope to keep clean this time.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Your "Gann" reversal points are very different to mine. You may have to download the new version. .. Come on mate, It's just few clicks

--- 帖子 #136 ---
auslanco thansk alot i undrstand only buy setting If 1hr QQE cross the 50 line upwards but 4hr QQE is still bearish but nor cross ... and candles on tft line we wait for buy until 4hr QQE cross upwards (above or below 50 line) i undrstand right or not plz tell me short setting more clearly( u post clearly but me not undrstand clearly) thanks acutally i am junior and i learn ur setup and i am thanksful to u for ur work

--- 帖子 #137 ---
for a buy signals: 4hr QQE does not have to be above the 50 line. Cross means blue line cross upwards the red dotted line(please refer to my MT4 chart above) Also a bar has to form above the TFT line(Gann) of 4hr charts before you buy.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
okay thanks alot i will undrstand more clearly when market open

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I think it is clearly explained with charts in the very first post of this thread... Have a look at it again

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Auslanco, Oh teacher of mine, would you grade my chart and tell me what I might not need? Not sure about the "std Dev" But I would like to think I am getting closer. Yellow---5sma Aqua----Gann high low Lower windows: Momentum---Aqua, 10 rsi---yellow dashs, 14 I hope I have this right soon so I can save the template..lol Not sure about when things update, seems that they have different times for different brokers.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
plz check my charts

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi Kevin.. It looks very similar to mine now.. I have attached a screen shot of my Gann trend reverse points on 1hr charts. The yellow line is the Gann Hi Low.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Yepp.. it's same as mine.. Good job.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Cool beans man... The rest look ok? or normal if you prefer? setting and all?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Now we have to find Gann trend reverse points indicator for MT4 ... Then ask Aus how it works till he gets bored :

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Post 97 or there abouts..

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thnx mate... I thought I have read all the posts... Guess I am still in the weekend mode Edit: That is the Gann Hi-Lo indicator... What I am looking for is " Gann Trend Reverse Points Indicator "

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Auslanco, I have a question, if you don't mind. Looking back on the charts, I notice that the 1H always leads the 4H when a setup occurs. It appears the 1H SI is always above 50 (for a buy) when the 4H signals a buy. What do you consider "way above"? You say if it is "way above" to wait for it to turn bearish then bullish again. Does that mean to fall below 50 then cross back above it? Also- Do you use this on any other pairs? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Que, Auslanco, Karmo and all contributors... Thanks. downloaded and working on MT4 Platform. , Thanks to all for your patience and knowledge..keep up the good advice Hamish

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I think that is why you only have around 8 trades a month, I was thinking to ask the same question what is way above, but if you back test it, i did, you will see that it can be safe to enter if QQE it is only a bit above 50 line, but it can also lead you to more losess, and you won't have the 90% succes rate. I seen that Auslanco sometimes enters a trade even if the QQE is above 50 line but he checks smaller TF for diffrent QQE crossings, things like this only come with time and after you get used with QQE and the pair moves, but it takes time... Just my opinion.

For all new people wanting this stratagy. Please download from this post. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=105 Post 97 is an older version and does not come with a nice template and readme. Use the link above and follow instructions and you will have a setup that looks like it should with little to no effort.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Auslanco, 1st, that you for such a simple system and all the help you have given this fourm. What TM do you say we can use for GBP/USD and EUR/USD. Thanks Peace

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I cant tell you exactly since I dont trade any other pairs. Best way to find out is experiment yourself with different time frames on a demo account .

--- 帖子 #155 ---
So let me get this... it has to TFT/GANN and the QQE/Strength Indicator have to be bent in order to meet one of the criteria? Regards, Guess

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Que, Auslanco, Karmo and all contributors... Many, many thanks! I'm an engineer and I've done lots of web/script programming and I find it pays dividends to get the littlest details correct. (I hope you won't think I'm being too picky). I'll get straight to the point...I have 3 suggestions for improving the QQE_Alert indicator. 1. With all my alerts from various indicators, I like to know the price at the moment the alert was issued. This helps one evaluate over time just how fast one should react to an alert. If I know that price nearly always retraces in a few minutes or longer, I can relax. Also, some alerts occur before the bar close, but price may change to where there wasn't a cross after all. The clearest way to give price is to give "Bid" price for DOWN alerts and "Bid + spread = Ask" for UP alerts: GPYJPY 5M QQE Lines Crossed DOWN !!! @ 226.77 GPYJPY 5M QQE Lines Crossed UP !!! @ 226.77 + 0.08 = 226.85 The code to insert would be as in the following lines: Alert(" ... DOWN !!! @ ",Bid); Alert(" ... UP !!! @ ",Bid," + ",Ask-Bid," = ",Ask); (NOTE: Use LOTS of spaces (6?) before the "@" for better readability!) 2. Whenever anyone says something like "the H1 crossed" or "one bar after the cross"... these are not clear because we have an inadequate naming convention! We are using the word "cross" (or "crossed") to describe 2 independent events. For clarity, we should change our terminology both in our postings, and in the indicators (to reinforce the change of words): Current Alert Text: GPYJPY 5M QQE Crossed 50 Line DOWN !!! GPYJPY 5M QQE Crossed 50 Line UP !!! GPYJPY 5M QQE Lines Crossed DOWN !!! GPYJPY 5M QQE Lines Crossed UP !!! The use of the same words "Crossed" and "DOWN" and "UP" for two different actions is confusing, especially with a long list of alerts over several hours. Proposed Alert Text (with prices added also): GPYJPY 5M QQE is BELOW 50 Line!!! @ 226.77 GPYJPY 5M QQE is ABOVE 50 Line!!! @ 226.77 + 0.08 = 226.85 GPYJPY 5M QQE Lines Crossed DOWN !!! @ 226.77 GPYJPY 5M QQE Lines Crossed UP !!! @ 226.77 + 0.08 = 226.85 It follows that we should never again say "... it crossed the 50 line." Rather, say anything like "... it is (or "went" or "goes") above the 50 line." 3. My 3rd suggestion is to offer the user a field to supply a custom sound file. All my alerts otherwise sound the same, but if I can give a custom alert sound, it helps to distinguish them from each other. I don't have such code handy, but if you need an example, I will dig one up. Just say the word... Thanks again for the indicators. Great work, and Auslanco, Karmo, ... thanks for sharing your system(s)! Que, please consider these 3 enhancements to the code, and I'm grateful you were willing to provide them in the first place. Pips4life

--- 帖子 #157 ---
so next hour either an incredible break out or even a smaller bar

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Well this is easy enough to do, Not a problem, I do not see how this would negitivly effect anyone. This says crossed on both as that is actually what the alert is looking for. It only Alerts when the Dark Blue line crosses the 50 line. It does not alert again until another cross takes place. No need to spam anyone. Pretty easy again, so this will be done.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Ok New QQE Alert Changes: Now has Price on Output User Defined text before price on Output Alerts only trigger One Time, not Two for each Alert *Note* Can not change sound as the PlaySound function and the Alert Function does not work together in an indicator. If you change your Alert sound in the options page of MT4 it will change it for all alerts.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thank you so much for the MetaTrader 4 indicators. It is so much easier to only use one application.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
First of all, great system, but I do not understand everything in it: 1)"A) 4hr chart: First confirm the 4hr Strength indicator has turned bullish "- What do you mean? The line should bent northward or should I check the last 2 values of it and see if there's a positive difference between them? Or do you mean that there needs to be a crossover of the two lines in the strength indicator 2) " SL aprox:100 pips from the 1hr , 50line crossover price." - Let's assume the open price of the crossover 1H was 226.00 , So My SL would be 225.00 If long, and 227.00 if short? 3) Do you have to wait for the 4h candle to close above the Gann line and then look @ the 1h line, or is it ok if you start looking at the 1h candles sooner? 4) When do you exit if the trade seems to go bad (Not talking about the 200/300 TP targets)? Do you lock in profits ,and if yes, after how many pips? I think it's enough questions for one day... I think the best thing would be to publish a nice clean comprehensive PDF GUIDE for you systems... With the MT4 charts, since I don't think anyone except you uses the VT . It's just a suggestion and it would be very helpful for the new guys (like me). Have a great day! P.S - 5) How do you scalp this pair during a consolidation? Please give a complete explanation .

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi Aus: About the "Make sure the candle has formed above the TFT line", should we wait till one bar formed above the TFT completely, or half bar above TFT is OK? because some times, when SI touches the 50 line on 1hr chart, there is no bar or only half bar on 4hr chart is above TFT, if we wait next bar to form above the TFT on 4hr chart, it is too late to enter. Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Que, Thanks for considering and implementing my requests to the extent possible. I'd like to clarify something... Regarding the Alert now triggering only once... I'm confused. There are two unique crossings which have been talked about, and actually, I see value in keeping alerts for both types of crossings, but I still would like to change the text as I previously described. When the Blue line crosses above or below the 50 line, that's one kind of "cross". This doesn't happen very often, as can readily be seen on any chart, even a 5M chart. (I would use the words "ABOVE" and "BELOW" the 50 line in the alert message to describe this type of event). However, the Blue line and the dashed-black line do cross each other more frequently. I know people have posted comments to say the various lines have crossed... aren't they talking about this type of crossing, and aren't these type of crosses still relevant? Although they happen more frequently, I see value in keeping these alerts also. It's not spam to me, although if you think it unnecessary, would you consider adding a boolean to allow them to be turned on by the user's choice? Forgive me if it's not for the "official" Auslanco system -- although I'm confused because I thought both types of crosses are part of the system -- however, perhaps you saw a post by someone using the older version to do 5M scalping, and made 350 pips in a day! Check out a 5M chart with the QQE indicator, and you will see that having both types of alerts are very useful for this method of scalping. Having only the 50 line crosses is not as good as having both types of crosses. Going above/below the 50 is like a major trend. The 2 lines crossing each other make for good exit signals, and possible re-entry signals. Thanks for making the changes you did. Please consider if this request to add back the 2nd-type of alert (with or without a boolean switch) has merit. I'm still new to this system, so I apologize in advance if I'm way off base. Pips4life

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Auslanco, thanks again for this great method. I have a couple of questions for you. When you say "Since the 1Hr SI is way below the 50 line" you will wait for a retracement - what exactly do you consider to be way above/below the 50 line? Certain amount of pips? Also, the confirmation candle on 4Hr chart - does the whole body of the candle have to be above/below the TFT line, or just the close of the candle? Thanks for your reply. Regards, Pluto2

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I looked through this thread and could not find how to make TFT lines? Is it certain MA's or is it a separate indicator? uh nm, I figured it out

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi QUE,(english is not my native language so please be kind with me ) thanks a lot for these indicators for Metatrader ! I used your indicators for about 2 weeks now and yesterday there was indicators with no lines on my chart and i don t know why ? I downloaded another platform from Interbanks FX site and it change nothing ! Do you know if there is someone else lives the same situation ? Thanks for your time ! Luk

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Go to top of this page and look to your right of the page #'s. Open the box with a number of (as of right now) of 29 and a paper clip beside it. Open it and you will see several downloads there . Download the one that says - " Auslanco Syatem Indicators.zip " - This will solve that probablem. Hope I've helped !

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Both types of alerts still exist. What I was refering to is, it only alerts one time not twice (Was a slight alteration to how I calculated end of bar). Both alerts are still there (The 50 and the lines crossing). On top of that, the ability to make the alert say what ever you want IS there. Please install and look at the features of the indicator.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
For anyone still using VT here is the QQE with alerts. Pink dot for sell and blue dot for buy (you need to got to "trading system builder" in vtrader, import, go to where the file is saved and click ok. Then go to add trading system and choose qqe alert. Thats it, you don't need to enable trading system as it is just for alerts not autotrading.)

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I saw what you posted day back concerning the QQE alert sound. how do i download it and get it install in my MT4. that is my type of platform from North finance. or can`t it work ,with it? if it will, i will like to know every step to get that done asd soon as you can. Thankjs you guys are doing a job in this Thread, well done guys... Mcmartins

Hey guys, in there ou said something about auto trading? if there is can you please tell me how it look and work for one? thanks....

The Quantitive Qualitive Estimation and TFT so called (Gann HiLo) is a nice combination for confirmation of trends. You know, I remembered now Erol system..FX Turning Point he was selling it to users.. and it worked perfectly on trending markets.. after that, we discovered that all he had used was QQE with HiLO just renamed them to "Strength indicator" and "TFT". After we discovered this guy system, and we know its all free setup which comes in VT package, there is no need for erol. There still benefit from your system, It's best when confirming trends on multiple timeframes. Thanks and keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Did you try this with other currency pairs? When I was trading this method some time ago, It worked well on many pairs.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Auslanco, Great system. I have been experimenting with it and have come up with a variation. Try using 4 different Gann HiLo Indicators at 5, 8, 13, and 21. Entry signal is where the price has clearly CLOSED above or below all of the Gann lines AND when the QQE is above 50 (for longs) or below 50 (for shorts). I have posted a recent chart of the 4 hour GPPJPY that shows the 2 most recent winning trades using this method. My suggestion would be to use the 13 Gann Line (the 13) as the Trailing Stop. I am not trying to hijack your system, only suggest an visual idea that might make the entries easier. As I see it. The 4 Gann Lines all tend to converge (when a good trade set up is present), and when the price is chopping, they are all over the place and thus dont offer you a signal...and keep you out of the market, where you should be.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Slade, I tried to add additional Gann Hilo indicators, but on VT said lookback periods must be between 2-10. How do you get 13 &amp; 21 added. Thank You,

--- 帖子 #177 ---

I changed a bit the TFT indicator to be able to change colours. it's a modified version of creztor SSL indicator.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
just curious, what's that QQE second dotted red line for?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Que.. You can play different sounds for different alerts. Check the PlaySound() function WAV files must be in the terminal_dir\sounds directory or in its subdirectory. I could uptade the indicator but I don't have your code.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
No you can not. If you are using an Alert in the indicator (Which I am) the Playsound() has a bug and will not work. You can look this up on the forum, it has been discussed many times. Alternativly, I could not do an alert and do a Playsound(), Print(), and MessageBox(). I am unsure if I want to do that at this time though. BTW, please look at your TFT code as the math is a bit wrong.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Maybe you don't need an Alert box... I don't like alert boxes too much. Only Playsound() and perhaps.. draw a VLINE in that candle, red or blue depending on the direction. I didn't change the math of the TFT indicator... only added colours. It is based on the code of creztor indicator. I can see now differences between your indicator and this one... mmm

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi: I am new on this thread. Read all, couple of times. I like the simplicity of it. Here are two charts 4H &amp; 1H for GBP/JPY on July 31st. It seems that it was not a good trade. Is there a way to avoid this somehow? Market went sideways here.. Is my analysis correct to go LONG? Any help and guidence is appreciated. TY Pipmonger

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I have been following this system for a while, and I am very impressed. However I would prefer to use the Accucharts over VT or Meta. Anyone have a setup for Accucharts they can post please? Thank you Cpreacher

--- 帖子 #190 ---
read the rule for opening a long position (i think it's first post of this thread): " 1hr charts: you only enter @ the point of the strength indicator cross over the 50 line upwards." from what i see on the carts you posted, SI on h1 was above 50 (59... something... right?). which means that a retracement was due. in this particular case, you should have waited for SI to go below or at least touch 50, and then only enter IF you see SI &gt; 50 AFTER a candle close. IF, remember, IF h4 conditions are still allowing the long position. i hope i was clear enough.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Thank you SCRAT: (1) I have read all and yes, the rules are on 1st post. I printed this and other supporting info on this subject throughout the thread. (2) 4HR chart has to setup before looking into 1 Hr. In the 4HR chart as you can see that the setup was completed 7/31/07 @ 00HR candle that was closed at 04:00. ONLY after this candle completion, the 4 HR setup was according to rules. RIGHT? (3) Now I go to 1Hr chart, which already has crossed over 50 (58.82)and candle is over GANN /TFT line. The setup is already there to go long. (4) QUESTION that you raised is SI is about 59 (58.82) and yes you are correcdt saying 59-( close). So what is the cutoff point? How far should it be to consider for a retracement? This was the status when 4Hr chart signal was generated, in this case Simultaniously... when 4Hr canlde completed. I understood that SI has to be way high up there to consider for retracement? Is 59 way up? I don't know. I hope this explains my understanding. Hopefully AUSLANCO, or someone with experience will comment on this. Thanks again. Pipmonger

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Do I have ANY of this correct? 1.) The 4 HR SI is bearish (BUT not crossed.) 2.) However, 1HR SI is well below the 50 line 3.) Entry is defined to be the 1 HR SI 50 point (therfore, a retracement to 241.20-40 level possible.) 4.) Wait until 1HR crosses-up over 50 and then drops below 50 5.) Enter SHORT How do we know that a retracement to 241.20-40 is likely? Sorry to sound like the DUNCE of the class! Best Regards, K http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1188276653

if it gets below here not much left in the way of support could see a nice dropa couple hundred pips, me thinks support will hold gotta run have a great night peace love and blue skies

--- 帖子 #196 ---
look at current configuration, there might be a chance to go short again: - h4 qqe already crossed down, so that's a sell signal; - now you're waiting for a sell entry: h1 qqe should cross down AND price must go below TFT line. if these don't happen, then do not enter short.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
if you don't understand why, here's the explanation: h1 charts are always faster than h4, so when you see a long configuration on h4 (in your case, qqe crosses up and candle closes above tft) you ALREADY have this on h1 for quite some time (remember, h1 qqe was already bullish... and at 59). so, to be sure that what you see on h4 is a trend, you wait for h1 to turn bearish (that would be a retracement... right?) and then you enter IF and WHEN h1 turns bullish again (assuming that h4 configuration is still bullish). now let me explain you something else: on your example, h4 chart confirmed a long setup, which means that the trend signaled a possible change. POSSIBLE. obviously, h1 chart already signaled this. if the uptrend is meant to continue, then you are supposed to see a big wave up on h4 chart with some small retracements (or swings) down along the way. when you wait for h1 to turn bearish and then bullish again, you practically enter on one of these retracements/swings. which should be safer. it's not important to be able to pick top/bottoms with high precision, but to be able to follow the trend. and for me, the safest way to follow the trend is to buy on dips (uptrend), and sell on rallies (downtrend). and that's what this system is supposed to do, that's why it's working so great.

I've done a fist pass at converting the VT-LevelStop-Reverse trading system to MT4. Auslanco uses this in his soon to be published scalping method. My version is just an indicator, not an EA. This is the first pass and it might be buggy, but I will explain how it works. First of all, Auslanco actually uses two versions of this. One is the VT default and the other is a modified version that uses custom ATR settings to determine the stop line. I've tried to incorporate both versions. The default VT version allows you to use two modes, optimized, and manual. Optimized mode calculates the stop line by using a 14 period EMA smoothed ATR(14) multiplied by a fixed multiplier of 2.824. In manual mode, you set a fixed number of pips you want the stop line to be drawn. In my MT4 version, there are three modes: VT default optimized mode. ATR mode (customizable ATR period and multiplier) Fixed stop mode (customizable fixed stop) The input parameters are as follows: UseVTDefaultOptimal - This mimics the VT optimized mode and ignores the other settings for "UseATRMode", "ATRPeriod", "ATRMultiplier", and "NonATRStopPips". UseATRMode - This calculates the stop line based on ATR using customizable period and multiplier. NonATRStopPips - If "UseVTDefaultOptimal" and "UseATRMode" are false, then this value is the number of fixed pips to place the stop line. ATRPeriod - If "UseATRMode" is true, then this sets the ATR period. ATRMultiplier - If "UseATRMode" is true, then the ATR value will be multiplied by this value when calculating the stop line. UpArrowColor - The color the Up arrows will display in. DnArrowColor - The color the Down arrows will display in. ArrowDistance - The number of pips away from the high or low of the bar that the arrow should display. On the colors tab, only the first color is used. It is the color of the dotted stop line. To use this indicator, copy it to your &lt;MetaTrader Folder&gt;\experts\indicators folder. Then restart MT4. It will appear in the custom indicators list. This is version Beta 0.1. As I get feedback, I will release newer versions as needed. Let me know if you find any issues. Bruce

Thnx Brucehvn.... Great help

Here's another trading technique by using the Gann Hi Lo indicator. In this case, when the price bounces off the 4H Gann, go LONG . http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1188592341

Hi Que, I'm using MT4 platform, downloaded files via your link at post#151 but unfortunately the ex4 files for QQE alert and Gann Hilo were corrupted. My metatrader can't open them. Do you mind sending me or direct me the link to the mq4 files instead? Just wanted to try out Aus's system with MT4 instead of using VT. Your kind assistance is very much appreciated. Rgds, Doremi

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Almost 1000 downloads on that zip file, I am sure the ex4's are not corupt. However, if you give me your email, I will send the ex4's to you via email.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Are you running the latest update of MT4? Sometimes if your version is a couple updates older, you might have trouble running the pre-compiled ex4 files.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Doesn't it update automatically when we open up MT4 charts? I have not been able to load the template to my charts but I attributed that to my lack of computer savy. I have been able to download the TFT &amp; QQE indicators without any problem. I'm using the momentum 10c from MT4...Is it any different than the momentum indicator on the template?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Use the new Momentum indicator. It's more compatible with VT version:

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Thanks...It loaded without any problem.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Yes, if you don't have any problems with that automatic update process, then you should be running the latest version. Sometimes if you are behind a firewall or something, the LiveUpdate cannot complete.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi Que &amp; Brucehvn, Thanks for the replies. I think I'm using MT4 and it updates automatically. I've dlownloaded the zip files and unzipped, followed the instructions but when I fired up the template...the indicators(TFT/Gann) are not there. This is what I discovered...most of the ex4 files I downloaded aint working with my MT4 but mq4 files do. I aint no programmer geek. Any idea?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I've posted an update to the indicator previously posted on this thread. You can now find it on Auslanco's new 15M strategy thread here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...8&amp;postcount=24 Bruce

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi Que In order to bring the MT4 indicators in line with VT for use with the 15 min new strategy, is it possible to code the latest version of QQE to place a dot above or below the price bar when it cosses the signal line, as well as the existing alert?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi Cryten, what is the setting for the qqt. alert ?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Mate it would be better to post this question under the 15 min strategy thread. As for your question, QQE with a smoothing setting 60 will do the job unless you only want the alert signal.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I do not understand what you mean, it is not related to my request to Que

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Sry mate I thought you were asking how to put the dots on price charts on MT4 regarding the M15 strategy

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi: I am having difficulty downloading and logging in to access the necessary charts that are used by auslanco. I would appreciate a pm from anyone who can help. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Is the alert use don the 4H or 1H charts? or both?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
From recent posts it seems that others are having the same problems with loading indicators as me. I have not been able to put the templates or zip file on my MT4 charts. I attribute the problem to my lack of computer expertise. So I have resorted to loading the individual indicators. With this I have no problem at all. After restarting my charts I find the indicators in my custom file and they work very well. Thanks very much to you computer experts in making them available to us. Auslanco System Indicators http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=1544716&amp;postcount=105 post number 105 If you can open zip files this should work well for you but I have trouble opening it so I use the individual downloads list below.

As I had a few PM's asking for both, I made it as customizable as possible from the UI. I think its self explanitory, check it out and see if this is what you guys are looking for. By Default all Dots, Alerts or Emails are off.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hi Que Could you have a look at the attached chart and the yellow vertical lines where qqe has crossed and bar closed. To me it seems as if the dots are showing one bar late, I think they should be on the closed bar where qqe crossed Maybe Aus could confirm if I am right

Hi, thank you for the system. What would you consider to be 'way above the 50 line' under c). can you please give an exact figure.

I don't have the slow dotted line on the version 5 of the QQE for metatrader. Is anyone else experiencing this. I appreciate all the work the Que and Brucehvn have done.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
If you are using black background, you need to change its colour. Have you tried that?

Go to the colors tab of the indicator and you can set them to anything you want.

Today, 3:00am lawrh http://www.forexfactory.com/images/s...ser_online.gif Member Member Since Jan 2007 Posts: 66 http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon1.gif Tid Bit for VT Trader users There is a "feature" of VT that I and possibly others find annoying, the indicator and trading system labels. They often obscure the position of the indicator and the candlesticks, especially the Stop Level Reverse label which also flickers. To create a much cleaner chart you can make them go away. In the navigator window select the Trading tab, then Chart Layers. The last two items on the list are Indicator Labels and Trading System Labels. Select one, a window appears, uncheck "visible", click OK and the labels vanish. Do so with the other and the charts become much easier on the eyes. For those who occasionally experience brain fade and might forget what the indicator or trading system is, just right click the indicator, choose edit and you will see the name. Hope this is useful

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thanks I appreciate the help. You are doing a great job.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
complicated systems give complicated headaches. standard and conventional indicators give the best results when you learn how to read them and most important to feeeeeeeeeel the market. i would suggest everyone to build their own system and adapt it accordingly to the market trend. what applies to topic starter might bring you terrible loss because he feels his system, you can't, because you are only readers not builders. VT Trader is a excellent platform to trade, L I V E (not demo) and beware of the spikes that are frequent.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
- If the labels are masking or obscuring details in your chart, you can also simply left-click on them and drag them out of the way.

pls can anyone recommend a good MT4 broker . i would like to open a live account

ODL Securities. Try and ask somewhere else, this thread is for other things.

I am downloading the Vt Trader, but was wondering if anyone here could guide me through the setup. I heard it's difficult to incorporate it into an MT4 platform and that's what i use. Help needed here, pls.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Do you want to use this system on both VT and MT4? The signals are written for MT4 also. If you do not want to use VT, you do not have to.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I would prefer MT4, cos am already on it. So, how do i get the chart set up for MT4 too?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I ONLY use MT4. All the indicators are on here. Just make sure you download the MT4 indicators and not the VT. Some people can only download the individual indicators while others are able to download the templates. There is a thread just for indicators...look and you will find it. I must leave right now but will check back later. Look &amp; read post #224 &amp; 225 on this thread. There may be other updates and tweaks also.

How anyone can tolerate the shit CMS feed on the demo account is beyond me. Plus VT is down half the time, they disconnect intermittently, and you get the occasional jump or outlier bar that doesn't appear on any other platform I use, which totally screws up the averages and patterns that I look for. I don't actually trade using CMS/VT, and now I doubt I ever would.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I check it when ever there's a new post, unfortunatly i don't know anything about VT, MT4 and i can help a little.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I had the same shit exactly. I wrote them, they gave me password again. Then my account was traded by someone, i already posted here in section about CMSFX what happened with me. So be very carefull, my parter got also 500 account and when he received it there were not 500 but 446 :-) terrible dudes

thats on his VT platform and look like highs and lows for different days, ie support and resistant points for each day. I use MT4 and this is not one of the current indicators he has in use. I am sure he will stop by soon and correct my lack of knowledge. hopefully it will be cleared up soon. i would suggest you load the last lot of indicators posted on the 15 min stratagy and this will become alot clearer.

tanx for been there MPP. how can i get the indicator of 15m strategy you talked about.

not sure what it's called, you will either have to track Aus down in the main thread and ask him or look for Brucehvn and Que, they are the developers of the MT4 indicators we've been using.

Hello I am new for forexfactory as well as for trading. i was going through your thread and i really feel to thank you for putting up the efforts so that people like me can learn how to trade properly. i have one question though it may sound silly but as i said i am new for trading so you have to excuse me for this. i want to know if you are applying 5sma for close/open/high/low or anyother? is it just simple moving average? as i saw on vt trader chart there are other moving averages as well. awaiting for your reply and once again i want to thank you for efforts and please ignore my lack knowledge as i know i am putting silly question to you. Best Regards Kenneith

--- 帖子 #269 ---
just for reference SMA = simple moving average EMA = expotential moving average you will see both these referenced on Au's thread, narly always it is based on the close, not yet seen anyone using different but i am sure they would make that clear if the idea was of help so in this case it is 5 simple moving average - closed. i have posted word documents on both this and the 15m thread that contan more details about the settings, us the paperclip at the top of this thread to find the files.

Yes MT4 open a demo account. 1.

Ask your broker support team about trading via MetaTrader 4 Server. this was sent to me. you can then download all the MT4 indicators from this and aus's other threads i've also post 2 word docs with all the settings, can't remember which page but you will find it under the paperclip.

not sure if it has a use, so if you know how, try it for a month each way and see how it feels. i keep it on because it's been there since the begining and i like to know if the 1h is bullish or bearish, but that has nothing to do with placeing a trade in this system.

i've not used it and don't know of anyone that has spoken of using it, but as with any new idea paper trade or demo it. i tend to use the 4h 1h coupled with Hakana's methods for entry and exit points on longer term trends. and the 15m for periods of boredom each to there own.

My 1h GBP/JPY CHART I started reading this thread earlier today and just finished. I put together my chart with a summary of my understanding of this system. I was hoping that one of you experts could read over my post below this chart and let me know if it sounds like I understand how to use this system correctly. I am a noob and have been trading the P/J for a while now so I understand it's charactoristics. I have back tested this system and it seems like a winner. The purple text is what I have questions about. PS...: do you guys avoid trading this system during NFP or Bernake type days? Thanks a lot -Kevin http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/7/30/148326/aus.jpg Summary of my understanding based on my 1H chart above: Using 4h chart determine Bear or Bull trend using QQE Strength Indicator. If green is below purple trend is bearish. If green is above purple trend is bullish. The red line in relation to the QQE SI does not matter on the 4h chart….all we are looking for is the cross of the lines indicating trend change. We can however use the angle of the lines to determine the strength of the trend. If the trend on the daily chart lines up with the 4h and 1h then we are looking for 300 pips. If just the 4h and 1h line up we are looking for 200 pips. In a bullish trade the stop loss is always 100 pips below the price where the green line on the 1h QQE SI crosses the red 50 line. Vice versa for bearish trade. After determining a bullish trend on a 4h chart we need to make sure the 4h candle has formed above the Gann HiLow Activator line shown above in gold. If the 4h candle directly above where the QQE green line crossed the purple line (forming our bullish trend) has not formed above the Gann line we wait for the next 4h candle to form above before continuing to the 1h chart for confirmation. Presently I do not know what “formed” is referring to. Is it saying that as long as any of the body of the candle is above the Gann line we are ok or does it mean that the whole candle has to be above the Gann line or does it mean as long as the candle started to form above the Gann line and could potentially be a bearish candle in a bullish trend? All of the previous may be correct and it may just be up to the end user to determine his or her own trading style and how to interpret the 4h candle in relation to the Gann Line. I would guess it is safer if the whole body of the candle is above the Gann line and less safe if the 4h candle started above the Gann line and turned bearish. Also I would assume that we do not need to wait for the most recent 4h candle to close before continuing to our 1h chart since our entry is based on the 1h chart. On the 1h chart we first confirm our bullish trend by making sure the green line has crossed above the purple line (not necessary?) on our QQE indicator and that the green line has crossed above the red 50 line. The exact spot where the green line crosses the red line in a bullish trend is where we are looking to buy. Before we can open our buy trade we need to make sure the 1h candle has crossed above the Gann line. Our entry will be the beginning of the second (confirmation) candle after the cross-over candle has closed. The closer our entry is to the 1h 5sma the better the entry. PS: I know this is a GBP/CHF chart instead of GBP/JPY

Hi all forex traders, Here's attached the EA. It follow the original strategy posted on post #1. Both attached indys must be in /indicators/ folder. It is very important to understand that when you test it (strategy tester) and then look at the charts to check the trades, you must look at H1 AND H4. Also, the default color line setting for QQE are wrong and i can't change because of the ex4 file. Then after test, to check the trades you must change the color setting on H1 and H4 for QQE: 1. QQE on H1 : 1st color ok, 2nd color to "none" and 3rd color to "none". Level 50 needed. 2. QQE on H4 : 1st color ok, 2nd color to "none" and 3rd color to "maroon". No Level needed. The additional options : 1. Basic Managed Lot Size based on account equity: AccountEquity x Risk / 100000 ... in other words, the lot size will be 0.1 lot for a 1k account and Risk set at 1. 2. Trailing.Start.at : possibility to start the TrailingStop at X pips. 3. Use.QQE.to.Exit : possibility to close the order when the QQE cross the 50 line on H1. Please test it on demo and let it be improved before go live. Best regards, FerruFx

Auslanco, If I may extend an apology to you.A request came from the Meta Traders forum if someone could make an Ea of this with the rules from page one.The EA was made and placed on Meta Traders.Subsequently,as it was your idea and thread as a courtesy the Ea was also placed on your thread. I feel that we should have consulted you whether you wanted this Ea to be posted or not on your thread before it was placed there.Please accept our apology and if you see it as incorrect protocal then remove the EA.I hope this has not upset other members who participate in this thread and our apologies extend to them also.

Slade, I know you posted this months ago (your post #175) but I have only just come across Auslanco's thread and have recently read it right through. I set up some charts with your multi-Gann indicator and yes, it looks good. Have you actually traded this idea, and/or modified it since? I also looked at MTF (multi time-frame) confirmation. Actually trading this on M5 when M15, M30 and H1 Gann's have crossed looks excellent. 350++ pips today could have been grabbed - worth pursuing IMO Anybody else tried it? Thanks ^ Optimist ^

I'm trying something similar, but with a different methodology -- so far it is proving to be difficult, only because the MTF indicators with alerts tend to slow down the MT4 platform quite a bit. I'm giving back a lot of profit (forward testing in demo) because of this. And then there is the issue of the QQE indicator -- an important component of the model -- hanging up. I need to refresh the charts every few minutes to get the QQE to properly print its signals. I don't know if this is a repaint problem or a software/coding problem, but from what I have read elsewhere this has been a problem for others as well. I had someone code the model into Neoticker, and it performs much better -- and Neoticker should be more resource intensive than MT4 to run, as far as I know. (I run two fast desktops and a midrange laptop PC, all with plenty of RAM.) Obvously, MT4 is much easier to handle and finding a programmer is extremely easy -- and they are generally very good. So I would really like to stick to MT4. I have no desire to automate -- only want a reliable chart. My question to you, and any others reading this message, is has anyone coded a version of the QQE MTF alert that doesn't hang or repaint? And has anyone coded an alert that doesn't bog down the MT4 platform? So far every version of the QQE MTF alert that I have (1 through 5) has this problem. Is this the code, or my computer? Or what? Any ideas at all are appreciated.

Hi all it is my 1st time to post in forex factory forums and i hope I can find some answers to my questions about AUS qqe trades 1_ Do the selling or buying arrow must occur before the qqe5 or qee60 crossing to take the trade or it could show after ? 2_ what is the maximum acceptable bars distance between the arrows and qqe's crossing to take the trade ? coz some times I see the arrow and after 2 hours lets say the qqe's crossing occurs (im talking about the 15 min stratigy) 3_ why some times i see 2 selling or buying arrows ? I have all the setting done ass recomended in AUS WEBSITE PLEASE HELP

Hello everyone, I am trying QQE indicator and the momentum that gave Auslanco, but I can see that QQE crosses later, (sometimes), than momentum. My question is: When should I enter the market? When momentum crosses or QQE? Many thanks

Does this system only work on the VT Trader platform? I heavily prefer MT4 and was wondering where I can get the two required indicators for MT4? A link in the first post to the indicators would be greatly appreciated, I doubt most people are willing to switch to another trading platform just to use this system.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
hello auslanco, just read through your strategy posted on ur thread.

Hello I use MT4 plate form hwo could i use this indecator on it?? also i see you put a zip file to be downloaded but i dont think it works with MT4 Thanks Ahmed

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi I have just started reading the thread. Downloaded the indicators and trying to understand the system. Here is what I understand thus far, would appreciate if someone could confirm whether it is correct or not: 1- MA 5 below Gann HiLo activator V2 suggests: Bearish 2- Once price drops below the 5 MA with the above being true it is time to make a Short entry. 3- QQE- The dotted line above the solid line signifies: Bearish 4- MoM- below 0 indicates?? Well thats what I have been able to understand thus far. Need to get a cup of coffee and read the thread through. In the mean time if someone can help this n00b by posting the entire system in a single post or point me to the right page would be highly appreciated. Regards Neo

--- 帖子 #338 ---
System is on the first page, no? Look at 4h trend, QQE has crossed, (thick line cross above dotted for long)... Price is above the Gann indicator 1h for entry... long if QQE has crossed 50 level line upwards and price has crossed Gann lndi up... Opposite for going short... Enter on next 1 candles open

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi Auslanco and others I am also a new trader and have back tested the system for October/September 2009. It seems easy and clear to use, now starting the demo forward testing. Question: there was another thread very similar strategy using the 15min TF's as well, can anyone confirm that we only use the 1hr and 4hr TF's for this strategy or do we monitor the trade on 15min TF. Your input is much appreciated and again Auslanco: thank you very much for this easy to understand strategy - now for trying to apply it. Look forward to seeing demo results. Paulette

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi Thanks cspip for your reply. I think I understand the system well now. Going to try it out with very small positions. I know people have been using this system for a while. If someone can post their results with this system over say a three month period it would be great. To all those who want the indicators on MT4. I think I have a zipped file downloaded from this forum somewhere. I will post it.(Hope I am not breaking any rules by this). Regards Neo

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi Find attached the MT4 indicators for Auslanco system. Note: I have not made the file. Please check settings etc before using. I downloaded it from the forum somewhere, would have posted link but don't remember where I downloaded it. Hope I haven't broken any rules. Regards Neo

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I'm pretty sure that this system is on 1H and 4H TFs.... ...the other similar 15min system also by Auslanco is here:- http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=45076

--- 帖子 #105 ---
How do you find this strategy? Can anyone post results for about a year?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Anyone still trading this system?? looking for some input on a variation to it.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Am wondering whether there are discussions going on regarding this strategy on another forum that I am missing or has it gone totally silent. Had a few questions.Padila

--- 帖子 #108 ---
can anyone please make a mobile push alert for the QQE MTF. would greatly appreciate it.
