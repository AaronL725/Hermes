I want to introduce a very simple but highly rewarding strategy. This strategy requires patience, but it comes with good risk -reward. The basis of this strategy is the use of the Trendline tool and horizontal line. Rules : 1. Identify a clear trendline break AROUND A COMPRESSED ZONE. Let price do its thing and break the trendline to the downside/upside depending on direction. Ideally we want to see price break swings up/down to/beyond the trendline, but it is sufficient to only break a couple of swings. 2. Draw a horizontal line to mark the price point at which the trendline was broken. 3. Watch as price returns to this price point. 4. Sell/Buy when price returns to the price level or wait for break of structure/ confirmation when price returns to price level before buying/selling. For best results, trade in the direction of the trend. Also key to watch where price is coming from after the trendline is broken. For best results we want to see price coming from weak levels. WHY DO WE NEED TO LOOK FOR COMPRESSED ZONES? The basic idea is that in a compressed zone, buy or sell orders are being accumulated. When one set of orders are significantly more than the other set of orders, price moves impulsively from the compressed zone. The breakout level or zone then becomes important when price returns. Ideally we want to see a slowing down/weakening of price as it returns to the breakout level. We can expect to see a significant reaction of price upon return to the level/zone THREAD RULES : READ ATLEAST THE FIRST 110 POSTS BEFORE ASKING ANY QUESTIONS.

Eurgbp today based on method On M30 we returned to previous level but didn't pull the trigger immediately upon return because it was the second time visit. But given that level, I looked for a setup on M1 for an entry.

Here, trading the retest is so easy

Great mate , simple, I use this too before another weapon

--- 帖子 #11 ---
GJ it already multi top now, good for short every retested, the last retest not reach red horizontal resistant but still in zone I saw

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Interesting

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Risk-reward depends on setup. You can take some profit off the table when price gets to a difficult area or hold and see if price fills obvious range

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Nice one. Eyeing that level on GJ for a sell next week

--- 帖子 #15 ---
same analysis mate.. subscribe.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
gchf seems same like gj pattern, broken down the last support blue trendline on red box and prob will bounce back to retest the yellow horizontal both support and resistant, will watch closely next week for confirmation

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I think that a step is missing after the trendline break. A swing must be broken before price comes back to the trendline breakout level. The SL I think can be safely set beyond the swing that broke the trendline. I think a break in structure is not actually needed on the reference timeframe. You can analyze a break in structure in lower timeframes to confirm it maybe.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thank you for the comment. I think it is proper to mention that this approach is not the typical trendline-break-and-retest strategy which is pretty common. In this method, we are looking for areas of demand or supply that are most important - clear areas where orders reside and we often would find those at trendline break levels. Hence it is important to note that price needs to break key levels to the downside (for sell setups) or to the upside (for buy setups). So your comments fits correctly with this approach - need for price to break a swing. For simplicity SL can be placed beyond the swing that broke the TL, provided the swing isn't huge. I would usually try to find LTF setup on a higher TF TL break level and set my sl based on the lower scale setup. That way, I can profit from huge RRs. There are more complex ideas on how to trade this approach, but I want to keep this thread simple, since it is still profitable with the simple approach.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi - Why do we even need a trend line? In most of the images above it is always the big bodied candle that had done the breakout. We can just look for consolidation that is followed by big bodies right? And that becomes your area of supply and demand. Next time around when the price comes to that level it will show the desired reaction. Is there a specific purpose to the trend lines?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Imo trendlines simplify the model because you just have to worry only about them. Otherwise you would have to discern the consolidation after the trend and the later break. Then you would have to find a entry reference level for entering. Besides, automating it is very easy due to its simplicity

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Yes, a heuristic approach to determine a market break is to spot a second swing break, that is why I mentioned it

--- 帖子 #22 ---
excellent I like your thread But give me a hand here - what happens if we take regular examples and avoid possible cherry-picking. Analyse that (as for film-titles), please...

--- 帖子 #23 ---
No one is cherry-picking here. First you didn't draw most of the TLs correctly and as a consequence your levels were not correct as per method. Also when price has visited a level we typically should not trade that level on the second visit. And we want to see price coming from weak levels. Thirdly, if in doubt look for LTF TL breaks at higher TF TL break levels for confirmation and to get higher RR. Fourthly, the US100 is a strongly bullish market. For best results trade in trend direction. And finally, backtest this method extensively and if in doubt, don't adopt it.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Ah, so the Supply and Demand strategy (or a part of it anyway) Subscribed, I've been using this on Cryptos but wish to learn more from this thread none the less. Hope you post for a while More for me to learn.

Hi mate, I share my experience using this simple way, so this simple method for me like to find the good sr in snd zones, I usually use D1 and H4 then find an entry on M30 with looking closely candle could be pinbar, engulf, or candl patterns like piercing, mother child inside, outside ... there are many ways to add certainty levels like add on H4 the zigzag or fractal to make sure peak or bottom prev swing no more continuation, to be honest I use other method too like fibo ret and form of harmonic pattern rhythm as history always repeat, but I realized no need the complicated method since this simple way is already enough and can give the same result Based on my exp usually this way always got huge RR as EngineerFX said but need patience. Last week many trades NJ NCHF, AJ, CHFJ most of it closed more than 50-90 pips. On my current trades GJ n GCHF on above charts I got more than 100 pips but not close yet so can be less, but see the risk reward is very good. So even sometimes you got false confirmation on LTF then the SL hit should be small a bit above or below sr horizontal lines or at the last peak / bottom of prev swings. And on your chart I think better no entry on retest red box as SL not good

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Even on that setup level marked by your red box the trade there is good. Usually we don't want huge SL so when the swing that broke the TL is that huge, we may want to zoom in and identify internal levels. As is clear on my chart (here I have zoomed into the area on M15), we can see that we can take the first trade there at the lower level with a small SL. TP1 will be as marked on the chart, because that area is another TL breakout area (or if you are willing to take the risk you may buy there as well especially because of the impulsive move). Then we see an internal level around 15070 that worked pretty well and we saw price go all the way down from there.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
yes mate, by zoom in to LTF we still able to get small risk

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Do you suggest any pair better than others? On indexes might work as well? Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I haven't studied this setup. In any case , each asset has its own personality, and as per my experience, it is better to focus on a sole security till you get used to it. NQ or S&amp;P500 follow the same pricing patterns as FX, but at different hours and with different configuration than fx majors. Equity indices should offer good candidates. I do not trade volatility indices, and I do not think they should be traded in this manner, since volatility is more related to the option strike premium prices. But the retest of anchor points occurs the same on equity indices. You only need to take a major index and test it yourself.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Just discovered this thread. I trade in a similar fashion, so, I will fit right in. I have a couple of indicators(MT4) that "auto draw" trendlines on all timeframes. They are very useful and work quite effectively(IMHO). I've attached them here, if anyone wants them. Thank you for sharing your trading system, much appreciated.

Closed my trade last Friday for the week, but it's pretty clear what happened to price

--- 帖子 #33 ---
The logic for this strategy is simple: In a compressed area one of two things are possibly happening: institutional buying or institutional selling. So when price breaks out explosively from a compressed zone (accumulation or distribution zone) we can expect at least a bounce when price returns to that zone. But why can't we just buy from a demand/supply zone? The answer is that we could actually do that. But there are multiple supply and demand zones on the chart. We want to only concentrate on those associated with compressed zones. That helps with patience (which is a requirement for trading anyway) and accuracy as well.

Perfect Scherzi. Exact level I was watching

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I see you have variety of time frames in here? How do you start looking. Is there a preferred time frame you start with and then move up or down depending on how many trades you find?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
That depends on how you define your setups. I usually take a higher timeframe and try to trade lower timeframes respecting that higher timeframe structures. But this is really complex and unless your strategy includes multi timeframe analysis, you do not need it. Secondly, the timeframe is very generic. At what time does your timeframe starts, for instance, for the daily bars? At 0:00 GMT?, at 0:00 UK time? at 0:00 EST time? at 8:00 Germany time? Why do you consider that specific hour, minute and second the reference hour? It is not trivial and, unless you have an objective, the timeframe is not important. I do not like trading below M5 because I feel a lot of pressure because of the comission, but many times I trade M1. Today I traded M30 for the GU short even if my targets were set using M5. Different assets react differently to timeframes. Maybe on EU you can see meaningful structures on M1 and you need to move up to M5 or M15 on another asset to frame objectives of the same duration and/or relative range. Adding timeframe analysis comes after identifying correctly price action. Instead, it is more interesting learning at which hours the different assets trade. It is easy, you open a chart and study for a month at which hours the price moves were stronger in average. That's it. Or if you do not want volatility, you do the opposite. I know that after 18:00 UK time GU is not going to do too much in average, that is why I warned about that on my post above about the GU setup, for instance.

Just checking for curiosity, I like scalping crytopcurrencies on the M1 timeframe. Due to the high volatily of cryptos you do not need leverage, even only spot long trading without shorting, and therefore, with limited risk vs unlimited profit is one thing I love about cryptos.

So, not having a break in structure, I closed the main trade and let only the first one, targeting the structure in progress. The sl was conservative, but I think I should have set my sl a litte above to duplicate my RRR. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In that manner closing at RRR 1:2 or 1:3 would have been easy.

Hi Brother EngineerFX , Which is the right time frame for this stratagy or it it valid on al TF ..kindly please

--- 帖子 #51 ---
This is interesting. A few comments: 1. One of the requirements is that price must be coming from weak levels. That criteria was not made in that trade 2. per that chart, price was in a downtrend and we should mainly be looking for shorts. Any longs there must have very conservative targets 3. There was a not-so-obvious sell trade there. 4. Price did give you 50% of the previous run and that was a decent move given that chart.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Best approach is to look for HTF TL breakout levels and when price returns look for setup on LTF around the HTF levels. The principle works on all TF since price is fractal

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Make sure you are actually drawing trendlines. Those are not trendlines because I can't see the swings there. Also, ensure that you are drawing trendlines around compressed zones.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Looks good to me. We should see a bounce there.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
can you kindly do corrections on my chart please.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
So - what you're saying - basically - is that it would have been a safer trade to sell this pullback (instead of buying the retest of the upside break). [I revisited page one: "coming from a weak level" is mentioned in your introduction - but not as a requirement; you just say: for best results... - Maybe you want to make this clearer or emphasize it - just saying.] It is helpful that you relate to examples in this way - thank you.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
a little bit confused with the trendline..

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thank you, I see, interesting the weak level idea.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Always recommended to find a level on HTF and find an entry on M5 or M1.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
See Attached Image (click to enlarge) When seeing at HTF, I see ascending prices instead. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And see on H1. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EU M15 is interesting also. M1 may offer something. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 7 minutes to 10:30 UK time. Let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Like I mentioned none of your drawings qualify as TLs as there are not connecting the swings. Perhaps you can find resources on how to draw trendlines outside of this space. Then you can draw again and we can analyse.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
This one failed. Not all will be winners. But in hindsight it would have been better to get a higher TF level then we look for setup on the LTF. Still if one waited for M1 setup there would be no trade in the first place.

Good level. But what if price just shoots through that level due to some strong news? That is why I recommend looking for LTF entry when price gets to the HTF level. We will usually get a chance to enter at LTF TL breakout level or after some BOS so pending orders are discouraged. But it is up to the trader

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Greetings from Russia EngineerFx Your system is great, and i really like to see how the comunity improves it. But I have a question not about it. Could you please recommend a couple books or videos, that helps you? I know, that there're a lot of books in FF, but I'm really interesting what helps you. Thanks a lot, and sorry for my language Jay

Hi interesting strategy, Does this work in all currencies?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi two trades with normal lot size. Using the TL to find convergence with the main PA. Short EU Attached Image (click to enlarge) Long UJ Attached Image (click to enlarge) The thing is that I used a variation for the second one to verify if there was convergence as well. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think that the SL level can be tighter, I need to check it. I will run a massive test on a simulator. Both trades were taken too early imo. I don't know if it was relevant, I will check it too. Regarding the confluence of news release, I personally think news do not have an impact on pricing and if you have a clear view of your price structure, news should respect it. That is why I was not worried.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
hey if you were gonna say "normal lot size" why did you blacken out the lot size on your screenshot?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
On a previous thread I mentioned that I was testing with 0.01 lots. I do not like demoing. But these last trades, I used the regular lot sizes I employ, it was not just peanuts. I mentioned it so that EnginerFx could know it. I never share the size of my positions when trading live. And if you wonder why I never share my lot sizes it is because I am a very bad trader and do not want people seeing how I lose. Just that.

Hi EngineerFX, I just found your Thread today and your strategy is very good and simple which makes a lot of sense but after some study I have the following questions for you. When you identify a trendline on the HTF (H4) and you get a trendline break and mark out the break with a line. When price return for the retest do you drop down to a LTF (15, 30 or H1) and draw another trendline? My question is this the time-frame you identify the trendline and break is that the time-frame you enter into trades? Because most of your examples it seems the time-frame you have your Trendline break is the timeframe you are taking positions on? If I have drawn out a trendline on the H4 do I consider a M15 break valid? can I enter a trade on a M15 break and retest ?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
There are setups that require the trader to drop down to LTF when price visits HTF TL break line and there are setups that do not require that. When price visits a TL break line that has very clean zones around it then we usually do not need to drop down. But if the zone is not very clean and if it is like the second time arrival we many want to hesitate and look for LTF setup within the HTF TL break area. In essence, when we have doubts or when we want to improve RR, we check LTF. When we are trading LTF TL break around HTF TL break lines the safe approach is to put the stop above the zone through which the HTF TL break line is passing. But with more skill you can put the stop above the LTF TL break zone. Hope all is clear. Also, it is VERY IMPORTANT that we draw TL break around compressed zones.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Some perspective: Setup A better than Setup B

--- 帖子 #76 ---
More perspective: Setup A better than Setup B

--- 帖子 #77 ---
thanks for the feedback and clarification. However are you saying Setup B we drop down to LTF to take the position? OR dropping down to LTF is just base on RR? Also base on the rule of the system we never take the break out of the trendline but we wait for the retest? is there a time period we have to wait for the retest after the break of the TL before taking a trade?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
There is more price compression going on in setup A than in B. And as you can see the TL of A is more slanted than that of B. To your last question, there is no time period, just look at what price is doing and judge for yourself if the retest is worth taking. Ideally we want to see reversal signatures as price is approaching the TL breakout line. And usually price will arrive at these TL breakout lines around news events. Your other questions have been answered in previous posts

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Okay noted. so if I was to get a break of the trendline I will be waiting for retest before going long?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Is price in a higher TF breakout level? If the answer is no, then no. If the answer is yes, we will trade the return to the breakout line, not the TL line. And we will only do this after price has broken a number of swings to the upside. We are not trading retest of trendline here. We are trading return to supply and demand zones created on the break out of compressed zones. The TL and the breakout line is just a simplistic approach and helps to frame the overall position of price. I recommend going through all the posts before you ask any more questions.

It looks cool but it seems like that it gonna take at least a week to open a position. In my actual trading experience, it is really struggled when after hours of study on charts and fundamental analysis, telling yourself "well, another day off" What a boring day, wow tomorrow looks like another boring day

--- 帖子 #84 ---
might be use lower TF M30 for seeking a trendline breakout and M1/M5 for entry then you might be can open a new trade everyday, it seems depend on our available time to trade for TF, I only seek D1 and H4 TF as not always available to see charts on lower TF, but patience can give a good result sometimes 200 pips more

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Totally agree that patience is really an award for unprofessional traders. However once people start trading CFD, they do want instant payback. If lose in one trade, really cannot wait to open another one. I have STRUGGLED for five years and started to be patient and tried to study on PARABOLIC SAR about one year ago. I have made some profits but still want more. LOL

Hello EngineerFx, Just to confirm. Do you draw the Trend and Horizontal Lines in M30 min and enter in M1? Thank you for your generosity.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Absolutely. ICT traders who can focus on return to TL break lines from compressed zones will make a killing

--- 帖子 #110 ---
This trade calls for a review of the scalping opportunity. So after call was made, we had price consolidating in a range below our level. Due to that consolidation one ought to be worried that price could go anywhere as we may have been having institutional buying within that consolidation. Still price gave about 2-3R for that setup before it hit another TL breakout level on the opposing side for longs.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Engineer, Thanks for sharing this great method. More and more I hear about ICT. If you don't mind telling, are you a student of ICT or you learned yourself? Is there anything else here comes into picture, what I mean as past couple of weeks I have been watching tons of ICT videos, so there is something like higher time frame analysis and other stuff like market structure HH,LL etc (do you do any of those?) How do you take TP on these trades? watching price action and levels? Also drawing trend lines is pretty subjective (when do you consider it a trend line, what I mean how many touches you like to have? 2-3 at least?). In your example of AUD/CHF was pretty hard to spot that other trend line which it bounced of and start moving up. Thanks one more time for sharing, very kind of you. Green pips!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
This is not an ICT method or thread. Knowing where stops and liquidity rest or areas of possible price fake-outs are central to any method. I am a supply and demand (orderflow) trader - pretty much most strategies are SnD strategies in different shapes and forms. This method is a SnD method, with a different style. I did mention to follow the trend so the sequence of HH, LL etc and support and resistance comes in. You must watch out for opposing TL break areas for your targets like I showed in the AUDCHF chart. Drawing TLs around compressed zones is not subjective. Ensure your TL connects the swings as much as possible with no swing crossing the TL. And watch out for internal TLs in compressed zones as well. Ensure you take time to read all the posts and analyse the charts before asking any further questions.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thanks for you advice. I will study on it.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
After the effort you have put into your thread, no one should be offended. I just find this thread easier to follow and understand (no offence) lol. When I keep it simple trading still gets complicated. Taking the view that 2 touches does not make a trend. Look for 3 or more without being too precise and maybe accepting open and closes as well as extremes. Really looking for a kind of sloping support or resistance line until price reaches supply or demand. Take a look at 7Billions post no. 107 as a good example.

Yes, the internal TL is better. The other setup is pure SR and if you are selling you cannot sell now because you are UNDER your structure. You can only sell ABOVE the structure. That is Babypips and such webs and books fault, posoning people's minds with absurd theories of bulls and bears fighting the lines. Attached Image "You can" does not mean "You must" at all. The typical buy on retest of Support and sell on retest of Resistance, that is crap. This is crap: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Nice one there! On AU: when price is moving strongly on approach to your TL break line, you may want to check if there are internal TLs that price may want to reach.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks, didn't see that at all. I guess that consolidation didn't look very attractive to connect that trend line. That's how I can tell you have very trained eye on this ;-)

Bravo bravo bravo. Saluti from italy.many years ago i have observed the same thing but i didn't believed on It.i don't Remember exactly why..maybe i wasn't ready to acept the Logic and semplicity behind this strategy.by the way my compliment and i'm on board.

Something to consider

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I'd have expected that you would have read the thread to understand what we are talking about. This thread is in its infancy so there is not much volume so it should be an easy read. Anyway, this is important: We are not trading trendline-break-and-retest. We are looking for areas on chart where price is compressed in a sort of a sloping range, which the trendline makes it easy for identification and framing . The problem with the popular trend-line-break-and-retest strategy is that your TL may keep changing as price evolves or to put it differently, your TL will keep repainting. In the chart below, I have marked a new black TL. As time advances, another TL may emerge. This is why we want price to ideally go out of the TL range/break swings so that we can trade the return to the final TL breakout line. Per this method, we are not faced with the challenge of a repainting TL, as price must break couple of swings up/down depending on direction. When price returns (not immediately), we are trading the test of the TL break-out point or zone.

Bitcoin 5 min I saw the impulse to the upside to test the highs again. Pretty risky trade, but went well. Firs got an entry and than saw inner TL and price reacted to that well. Plus it was a brake of HH (I though maybe it's manipulation and price might drop). Don't like bitcoin much as it has high spread. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I like your thread, I like your idea etc: I hope - people tend to be oversensitive regarding their own work - you don't take this the wrong way: I read the complete thread - and it wasn't clear to me that it is definitely not a TL-break-and-retest-strategy. What is totally clear to you (when writing and rereading it), may not at all be clear to other people (whose brains are "wired" fundamentally different from yours). I understand that this is "a work in progress" but nevertheless: I think you should take the time and redo your first post and define all necessary criteria clearly, undisputably and with examples (aiming for objectivity, I'd call it): Why: because if people start on a wrong footing (i. e. certain preconceptions of what to expect), things won't work out for them. For example: what exactly do you understand by "weak levels", "compressed zones", "sloping range" etc. To say: it is in the posts is - I think - not really helpful, as people who don't know exactly what they are looking for will not be able to find it. (If you don't know what you are looking for there is no point in searching etc). All the best

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I understand the following: Not a TL break and retest idea: Yes, EngineerFX says it is not, therefore it is not. Weak area : The area where prices come and go from is inside a wider and therefore stronger area that usually I have seen will deliver stronger candles in average. Compressed zones : horizontal ranges with or without well-defined swings. Sloping range : A price interval that, shows a somehow sharp ascending or descending channel over a period of time. This is what I understand after checking the charts and reading the thread. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers.

Just went through all the posts and I noticed the confusion some people are going through, this is a supply and demand strategy which uses a trendline break / compression as a confirmation, as a supply and demand trader this is an interesting thread and good work creating it. Let's keep the posts going.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks a lot for your answer. I would prefer EngineerFX to answer (because it's his thread, therefore his answer seems more valid). "Not a TL break and retest idea: Yes, EngineerFX says it is not, therefore it is not." - I think everybody understands that but what does it mean? To know what something is not, doesn't help to make people understand what it is (to say something is not green doesn't tell me which colour it has). "Weak area: The area where prices come and go from is inside a wider and therefore stronger area that usually I have seen will deliver stronger candles in average." As all markets are fractal you could say that almost all areas - if you look at different TFs - are areas within wider areas - so your definition isn't really quantifiable. The same applies to the points "compressed zones" and "sloping ranges". I see that you want to help but I still think a reformulation (precise definitions with meaningful examples in post 1) by EngineerFX would be best and most helpful, especially to all newcomers. Of course, this is only a suggestion as it may help to avoid the same questions popping up (hundreds of times - as - I think - we know from other threads).

I think that additionally to a trendline break, what we may look for is also a stronger structure break that, ultimately, as you very righly indicate, is represented as a trendline on a chart. But he also talks about weaker and stronger, about highs and lows close to areas as well. That is market structure per se. EngineerFX mentioned Wyckoff and S&amp;D and others trade using ICT as well, that are completely different systems and have very diverse foundational concepts and patterns. And imho what it happens is that the thread tries to be system-agnostic, which is very good because it makes the topic easier to understand and universal.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Josi, You cannot accuse someone of being oversensitive and expect them not to take it 'wrongly'. There are literally plenty of chart examples that illustrate this approach. It makes sense that people read previous posts to get a comprehensive idea of the method. I will continue to improve Post1, but the reasonable thing to do is to go through the thread to have a more-complete picture.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Just a short I took on EU today. RRR ~1:2.5 It is also valid under this thread. The system is repricing EU from 2 into 1. So we are moving relatively down. At a certain moment prices come up into 2 from 1 and there is a fractal sloping range under 3 (because 3 is compressed). But the main momentum is descending or negative. So the idea is selling there with SL above the prior swing and TP @1:3 that it is executed later at ~1:2.5 because I see slow movement. But the TP is not actually there to achieve a certain RRR, but because the distance is proportional to the size of 2 and comprised within the last range. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is a generic approach that any swing trader can exploit no matter your ideas about what moves markets.

Thank you for your answer. Thank you for your willingness to adjust post 1. I was referring to "people" - not you (or any other specific person) and by doing so was "only" speaking from experience. Many people actually are very sensitive and averse to any - even sensible - criticism, and therefore tend to overreact easily.

Hi guys, I am also a snd trader but not pure adopt this sytem, I adopt the breakout tl as the horizontal line will be a good place for support and resistant but I use snd zones too for entries, especially the nested or heavy snd zones so enter can be happen if still in zones. Compression is a form of small swing and price is in discount, usually candle with tail will be a sign, I marked in red rectangle or in uptrend / downtrend structure it will be hh hl lh ll, and drag a tl to know when the breakout happen, in my chart it happen in blue rectangle, usually it always give a decent reward R:R or small risk by trading near its horizontal line.

Its easy but not profitable in long term. I traded this strategy on H4 some months then blow acc.I know...

Any whiff of negativity, poster will be blocked. Constructive criticisms are welcome BTW. If you are old enough to trade forex, you are certainly old enough to make a judgement on whether you should adopt this method. IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS, PLEASE DO NOT TRADE THIS METHOD.

If you still blowing accounts whilst on a higher timeframe like H4 which offers lesser trades aswell on a strategy with high r:r then you should invest your time and focus on risk management first.

I let this image of yesterday's activiy. It is all I did and most of it can be framed within this thread. I was seeing descending GU yesterday, so I got a bit confused when the pricing systems opened USA at the bottom, offering ascending opportunities. But then, it finally started to go down and I felt more relaxed. There are a few microtrades that are out of topic, but the majority fit within the thread. m1 perspective Attached Image (click to enlarge) m5 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Maybe the last short is not that obvious. See. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There is more context than just a TL break, but the relevant idea is that TLs are there as described on this thread. I love when people say that Technical Analysis is an illusion lol. With this post I think that my contribution to this thread is completed, at least for now. Otherwise it would be repetitive what I write. Thank you a lot, EngineerFX, for sharing your knowledge with the public. I like trying to support genuine threads like yours.

Before you take any trade, try to identify the opposing TL break line or zone and mark as TP1. Then you decide if the trade is worth taking. In this case, it wasn't.

EU on 15mins TF is in a clear downtrend so the initial buy was a risky one. But that level being a swap level was useful in the future and provided confluence for the sell trade.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
That's a good way to spot targets, noted

--- 帖子 #172 ---
That is one of the reason of why I posted this, because of the downtrend in the bigger timeframes, but the first reason was the flip. Many trades could result in a loss, so this is a quick way to take your money back. Also its only an example.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Yes, we can learn from failed trades too

Right! Also we don't have to trade failed set-ups (I mean opposite a trend) we just have to wait to fail and then trade with smaller risk than the reward.

This morning had some first loses. However, could be avoided and I was suspecting them. AUD/USD 5 min I though to exit at number 1 as consolidation was taking place and we had huge rally down, so was expecting retracement to start. Same story on EUR/AUD and NZD/USD. Became little greedy and didn't exit 3 of those at 1R, but really wanted to(also was driving at the time of that). So lesson learned here. These loses were small due to good risk reward on these trades, thinking to put brake even on riskier trades when 1R is achieved. However, my bitcoin trade went well. So the lesson learned one more time. When I'm playing on bar replay this strategy that's when I get caught on the wrong side. But I love RR in this strategy.

Is this a good set up? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #179 ---
You must read what is happening to price. Always draw opposing trendlines and watch out for the breakout line as the first target. Ideally we should trade setups with a decent first target. In the same way you find your setup, find your next target. Same story on NU and perhaps EA in your post.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thanks Engineer, that looks perfect and I would definitely closed there if I saw that other brake there. Just took a trade on GPB/USD, exit on what you just sad. Funny I marked my zone and took a look at FF and saw your reply =))) Gave my trade 1:3RR win. Almost covered all 3 loses this morning. I see other pairs did the same set up but I was late on entry so passed on them. Also I notice what you sad before. These levels respected all the time. You look back or you wait for future price movements. That alone gives you an edge and plus when you put your level you can glance and see how good the level you picked. With GBP/USD I saw strong rejections from that level, gave my trade additional confidence. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is what I missed when GBP/USD did what it did, so beautiful.

It is nice and easy to understand your strategy, i will try it on demo, so which timeframe do you use on this strategy?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
This strategy is universal. That question you need to ask yourself, what type of trader are you. For example, I'm scalper I like small time frames and short trades. If you are patient and can wait for longer time you can use higher time frames, but you need much more time to identify the set up, wait for it to unfold and than trade it.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi Engineer, can you please let me know if the setup is valid

--- 帖子 #186 ---
hi folks, can someone highlight the orderflow part of this strategy? I use orderflow aka cummulative delta as my primary indicator. this tech isn't available on mt4/5. so i'm curious what is going on. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
You can assess an inversion of your cumulative delta after market structure break at premium or discount levels. However it is just a factor of confluence, not an absolute change.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
lol say what?!!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I understand you mean that you are tracking the either level II or market price qty book of your asset to verify if the prices have enough liquidity or not to support them. That you use kind of cummulative buy/sell indicator you name "cummulative delta". Otherwise, pelase elaborate a bit your message. What I say is that us who use technical analysis can see the orderflow through the charts in different manners. This is one of them. When price is high, that is also called "premium", "top", "supply", etc.... The name may vary, the idea is the same. Price is high and therefore, informed traders will sell it. When prices are low, then informed traders will buy it. Buy low, sell high, the basic lemma. You asked about the orderflow. The order-flow is quite simple. Orders are bulit at the bottom to move prices up. Orders are built at the top to move prices down. Informed traders sell while prices are moving up and buy while prices are moving down. ok? The uninformed traders will buy while prices are moving up and will sell in bearish conditions. So the idea is that we want to sell when prices are at the top (we sell as prices move up). And we want to buy back when prices are down (we want to buy while prices are moving down, before they move up). So when you see a break of the ascending momentum and a decline of the impulses (slopping prices vs completely vertical prices), then you know that the order-flow is switching from net long to net short or vice-versa. I don't know if my explanation is what you ask, otherwise, please explain better what you want to know.

Nice one @scherzi. This is the view of an expert/trained eyes. It is partly because of the likelihood of stop hunts above/below double tops/bottom that I have recommended LTF confirmation because the LTF setup would occur most likely after the stop hunts. However for the trained eye, price orderflow reading is a more informed exercise. Kudos!. PS: The best setups are the ones that occur after stop hunts above double tops/double bottoms

When drawing TLs, ensure that the TL is broken ONLY at the TL break level. Watch out for internal TLs as well More importantly, look for TLs around compressed zones. And the best setups are the ones in which the TL breakout line/Zone was not previously tested ( check Post 75 ).

I want to mention that the most common mistake I commit is related to FOMO . It happens more often than I would like and I am not going to say that it is caused by causes extrinsic to me necessarily. This is one of these trades I am regretting about. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So what I do is just to close it or diminish the lot size asap and to take profits in recovery mode, just to avoid loses. Here, the fact is not that it could either be or not a valid short, but that I ignored signals telling me that prices were going to move higher and now my RRR is one half of the one I would have got if I had followed a more disciplined entry. Anyways, I do not like the level, it is not the ideal high level I usually take when shorting. I mean, good for quick scalps, but unpleasant for long shorts to me.

I try not to be too biased by predefined names (UK session, support, ...). When we need to look at another place headfirst is because the PA is not talking by itself. We need to flow with the chart.

I think a top-down aprroach is better, so if the overall chart is not telling you anything clear, then I think you should go for another chart and/or timeframe. Regarding the levels, what third parties say is always biased and nothing guarantees they are going to be able to express what they think or that you are going to understand what they intend to.

Ok, I took this trade today. I had to close it early because I entered by mistake 5% of risk, so I closed it with only effective ~5:0.25 RRR of profit to avoid being exposed to markets with such a high degree of risk. But the configuration is quite clear. Nothing is guaranteed, but there was a compression area and other confluences there to go long. And it also fits within this thread's basic idea. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I also took it late, simply because I was looking too many charts and saw it at that point (reason why I opened the trade too fast and did not notice the trading assistant had the default 5% iof my lower risk level that is never higher that 1%).

Engineer - if you get a chance I'd be interested to know if this trade fits the criteria of what you are showing here. My guess it's not although you'll probably understand why it worked. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I'd say it is very much in line with the criteria. See annotations on chart

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Great - we're speaking the same language. Pretty much exactly how I saw that PA although too lazy to write it all out. In case anyone is interested as to why I TP'd where I did, there is a very minor RBR (which I marked) as demand. Given that NQ is flying up, any shorts are likely to be short-lived so price was likely to (and did) turn at the very first place that buyers might come back in.

Good bounce on GOLD from obvious compressed zone. Watching out for PA in the upper zone for a Sell trade. Price approach is important

The feedback is that you are illustrating a idea/approach that is different from this strategy. This BTC setup is not in line with what is being discussed on this thread.

Very interesting. Hope you uncover your vision. Why no sale trade? --&gt; I think because range was pretty big and not compressed enough. Also if look on that big move it started from red trend line brake not blue. Green line must be some level from before. Also looks like it was respected as resistance before as well.

There are a number of reasons why I wouldn't have sold at that level although I'm pretty sure most wouldn't what you are looking for. With regards to the the lower level we have different feeds but, on my feed it's a classic QM level. On your feed it's a rather unappealing FB level (i.e. it's an FB level but not one that I would ever trade off). I should add that many traders would do - it's just not currently what I'm looking for. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #291 ---
The line is close to the 50% of the range from top to bottom, but I have not found a precise level, nor it is related to a D1,W1 or M1 relevant high or low imo. I don't know what it is in terms of this strategy. It is however a long accumulation under multiple bottoms at the chart, but any line below these lows would fit that description, so I don't know. The reason for not buying may be the reason that double tops are there, thus the area is already traded. And I guess you are assuming that the trendline should be considered traded too, therefore, you have drawn a new line above.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
very good responses to the question. All are valid responses, but from the perspective of this trading approach the annotations from this chart are my explanations.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
blue line is a liquidity grab or breaker,so price has to restest it and come back after MM finsihes the stop hunt. the green line is a support

Whilst looking at EG also spotted this horizontal range from Friday: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I think the horizontal ranges are merely contract accumulation areas and they initially do not have directional bias. One my find micro diagonal ranges within horizontal ranges, but the impact or expansion of such ranges should be proportional to their size and duration. Small in this case. In that area, I see this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Regarding why price bounced dow off that level, I have found these significant confluences: 1- Two candles at the same level forming support: Attached Image 2 - An old breakout trendline translated to a new swing low: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3 - This rare breakout. According to this thread, one could assume that old orders being accumulated in that compression area are being retested. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 4 - This is the micro-breakout area on the m1 timeframe. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 5 - I was doubting about posting this last coincidence. See the m1 structure confluence with the nearest round number at the breakout inside the candle bodies. One can consider wicks as delaer's spread just to simplify the idea. To understand the significance of that m1 area, one can verify how the highest high corresponds to the 100% expansion of that area. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #298 ---
For anyone wondering why my TP was there and why price bounced off from that level yesterday, this is the reason. Price went very bullish from that level yesterday TL breakout lines/Zones are strong swap zones that attract/repel prices. They are the best supply and demand zones.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Thanks for the info. This thread has improved my accuracy. In my case, I use a mix of personal structures and ICT-based order-flow; and adding that perspective with trendline breakout levels acting as rejection panels helps me to determine more precisely the market maker pricing models. Great thread.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hey Guys, maybe we can add div for confirmation? Very interesting thread!

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi, Garrus. One of the rules of the thread is not using indicators. I think it is because the thread is devoted to order-flow itself. Besides, oscillators are useless. You can see by looking at a chart when price is in either temoprary oversold or overbought state when a horizontal accumulation is formed. Depending on the following structure, you will see it rebalancing up or down. And logic helps. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Would these 2 charts be valid setups? NZDUSD is 4hr break and would look for LTF entry at this level. SILVER is 1hr break with TP around previous break for the move down. Would also look for retest on LTF for entry.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
This is my sole opinion. I don't know very well this specific technique. For me, this schema makes more sense. This is am order-flow schema, not the trades I would take. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Then, imo, your bearish setup is feasible . I think the following price schema is also valid. Attached Image (click to enlarge) With price schema I mean areas of S/R and their relevant strength. It does not mean price will follow that order, nor each area would make prices react in any particular order or depth. LTF for confirmation at each existing or new level is needed always as price evolves and the market structure changes.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Great that we are now reading price and using TLs as potential entry points. Riding on your analysis, this is a possible model price is playing, at least on this time frame. Price spent a lot of time ranging in that black box consolidation, with orders being accumulated. Then we had a strong move down, which according to this model, may be a run to clear stops and manipulate the herd into more selling. Then price reversed around 0.6810 and now appears bullish, in what we may call distribution. We are now at a TL break level and we may see some retracement down before the bullish run continues around 0.6892 which is another TL break level below a double bottom. There is a lower TL break level that price may reach before the retracement is done and price resumes the run up. Utlimately this is a model and we can adjust our views and expectations as we get more price data, but the TL break levels should give us opportunities regardless.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Wyckoff would probably agree with what you call accumulation. He certainly wouldn't agree with what you call distribution. You may think this is just about words (phraseology) but actually the wrong word may well represent a faulty concept. But then again - who am I to tell you how to use pre-defined words (with their established contexts)? It was Wittgenstein who said (in German with an Austrian tinge, though):“Anything that can be said can be said clearly.” And this is me talking to someone who calls himself engineer (in German a synonym for the most meticulous of all people).

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I would rather be your friend than be a friend to your shadow.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
The important thing to note, and I think most people get it, is that after a consolidation, price often tends to move very fast usually but not always after clearing out stops. I know the expression distribution may convey a slight different meaning to Wyckoff admirers but the idea here is that there is a release, so distribution resonates with this idea. But your continuous attempt at making comments that are borderline disrespectful is unwelcoming and unappreciated.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I guess the next step is to block me for making critical comments (There is a difference between "disrespectful" and critical, you know. Actually, to be critical - in my view - is to be respectful - because you take what the other person says seriously enough to bother whether it may be wrong or right). As Popper said: the attempt to falsify is what science is all about : Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #309 ---
When I say distribution, I also mean contract distribution. And contracts can be either long or short; therefore, distribution can be ascending or descending. Instead, when prices are idle, we can talk about accumulation of orders at relative highly liquid areas. Moreover, when someone buys a counterpart must sell; thus when prices moves, the number of short contracts equals the number of long contracts filled always. Same when price moves down. It is a misconception thinking that price moves up when buyers are leading and that prices move down when "bears" are stronger. That is not true. Unfortunately I blocked user josi weeks ago and cannot read his messages. I am sorry.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Also, a bit more detailed insight on the other chart. Or what I was looking at. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Buying above equillibrium (buying high generally speaking) is ok as long as price made a significant expansion, that it is not the case now imo.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
And this is me talking to someone who calls himself engineer (in German a synonym for the most meticulous of all people) For the record, the above is what I find 'borderline' disrespectful, and unappreciated. It was an unnecessary addition. Not your critique of my use of the word 'distribution' for ascending prices.

I saw this late on M1. SL moved to BE and took partial profits. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The basic problem and reason why SL was rapidly moved to BE is that price is high.

Hi, anyone watching this? Aud/Jpy.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Is the setup correct? Best Chriss

--- 帖子 #321 ---
May work but not the best setup. See note on chart However, if price gets there and leaves a strong supply/OB we can trade the retracement into that level.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Imo, ask these who say that, for which specific setup is HTF more reliable and require an exact percentage of accuracy for that specific setup across different timeframes. They can also provide charts with evidence. Otherwise, do not believe anything. Most courses, articles, videos, books and statements are just people repeating what they think they heard and never verified somewhere, sometime, if not just dream. If that person tells you that the setup is related to weekly corporate reports against the last month's data; then it should be obvious why that strategy would not be valid for LTF. You always need context. On the other side, I usually trade upon HTF structures. But these structures provide possible bias, not entry signals in my style. If I am on a daily support, then I won't be looking for shorts and I won't take any short as a high probability trade. Even this thread talks about the convenience of delineating the TLs on HTF and then looking for analogue fractal PA in lower timeframes. M15 and M30, for instance, are good TFs for framing your M1 and M5 setups. Not to say D1.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
+15... Done

--- 帖子 #324 ---
It's important to differentiate between a trading system and a trading methodology. What engineer is showing is a way to read price action / orderflow (methodology) and, as such, this means that the 'setup' is valid on any timeframe because price action / orderflow is fractal. The only reason that a trader might favour a higher timeframe over a lower one is because they might, personally, find it easier to identify and trade off higher timeframes.

Assuming it is going to fall and assuming it is not going to go up. Assuming everyone is using only demo accounts to test. I don't know if it is going to fall or not , it is just an assumption to illustrate the orderflow in such case. This is how I see it under that assumption that is not a prediction nor an advice of any kind.

I was tracking m1 for entering. I did not find a valid m1 signal to my taste, but I found this in hindsight once everything happened. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There is a third trendline that coincides with the level at which price bounced off. I missed this one however, because I do not like trading levels, I always try to find PA confirmation that, in this case, only allowed me to take a couple of scalps. I need to work more on this, because when there is structure, the accuracy is really high. But the structure required is not that easy to spot all the time.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
so accurate touch and go

--- 帖子 #356 ---
See notes on chart. Ideally we want only clean levels where price has not returned to. The idea of compression is the same as presented in those links. But the approach/strategy is different. Compression is just a tight range where the market movers are slowly building their positions after which price moves impulsively. We are betting on the probability that price will bounce when it returns to the exit point from the compressed range. Usually when the exit point is not respected, we can trade the opposing retest.

My account grew this week, so next week I will be able to trade US30(5 min chart). Look at today's beauty, only with risking 15$ on one trade and $10 on another you could get 200$ return. Attached Image (click to enlarge) To people who think that brake out of compressed zone always suppose to have touches, its not like that. Many times price leaves brake out and shoots up. All other issue are still there as well. Market manipulations, stop hunts. I love how ICT describes it, that smart money goes and takes out both sides before going to the direction it suppose to go (garbing liquidity). But the main thing is here, the precision of this system is great, respect of levels amazing if zone choose correctly. Draw your levels, look to the left and you will see how it was respected, or draw them in past and see how in future price reacted. I find this system has many positive sides. You know exactly what you are waiting for, small stop loss to better reward, no lagging indicators (which is big in trading). Most of successful traders are naked chart traders. Reading the price is the main skill you need to acquire and it comes with time. What one can do, install free replay on MT4 (there are programs on this site to do that) or pay trading view for bar replay (you can switch time frames there which is huge plus) and just sit and play it, trade it, practice. Forgot to add, not all days are the same, but what great about this system it works in any market conditions which leaves you with less chances of big draw dawns (like majority of trend flowing strategies).

See, it is running the lows. I think that the issue is that it is respecting resistenace structures and, in order to reach the low, it had to break a couple of support structures. Therefore, the idea is that the structure, not being broken above, and having a strong downwards momentum, needed to break down before moving up since it did not created a market structure break above, due that it was respecting highs and breaking lows basically. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This also implies that the current negative structure created after the breakdown could prevail. It is just an assumption this last idea.

Absolutely. But pivots points, psychological S/R levels, Fibonacci retracements levels and hundreds more allow the creation beautiful colored charts.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Just think that the price of an asset is established by a computer program. That also applies to forex. Given a expected liquidity map, the system will try to fill in the market orders at the same time it generates a pricing model that is useful for the objectives of the market owner. In Forex, the owners are central banks. Stock exchanges for assets, crypto exchanges for cryptos, tokens and so on. But the fact is that the big pockets own these markets and prices are manipulated 100% of the time by their software. And the underlying pricing systems are the same for all. The software is not repricing by buyers or sellers power, but because a set of parameters that are in line with the interests of their owners as they configure these programs. As long as you identify any of the patterns that software repeats and figure out how to trade it, you are in.

This quoted post is very important if anyone wants to improve their edge. Best time to sell an asset/market is after buy orders have been distributed (when there are few buys to oppose the sells). So ideally we want to look for a STRONG BULLISH run, wait for price compression (accumulation of sell orders), a move downwards (sellers in control), then we can trade retrace to TL break line.

All right, computers are used everywhere and have sophysticated algorithms. But there are important differences on the different markets, so I don't think it is helpful to put all in the same basket. When you trade CFD, big banks can not influence the price. Commodity prices are mostly influenced by the underlying physical goods Supply and Demand. Only actual buyers of the physical goods, either spot or futures can influence their prices, or the goods' Suppliers, or the middlemen for the goods within certain limits, or the dollar strength when goods are priced in USD. Indices prices can not be directly manipulated, except by fake news of all sorts. Of course, injection of liquidity in the banks to make them purchase stocks, move prices up and sell them later for a profit is manipulation. Individual stocks are much more manipulatable than Indices, mostly by fake news, fake company reports, fake company data, fake company projects. For Forex, the big players can see perfectly the book of orders, place fake orders to move the prices and hunt the stop losses. This is their everyday bread and butter. Prices in Forex are not limited by Supply and Demand, they are only broadly limited by the country's Monetary Policy. For example, the FED has instruments to change the strength of the USD and uses them when it is deviating too much from the established targets. In between, prices are freely manipulated by the big banks and other financial entities to rip off the retail trader. Cryptos have no limitations at all, in theory they can reach the moon. So they are the most heavily manipulated Instruments. And so on.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I agree except on the idea that certain assets are broadly more manipulated than others. I think that what we have is a financial instrument that trades a bounded range. Once we determine the range, no matter why it is limited to such pricing spread, we have the same problem in hands. For us is an offline problem and the difference among assets that trade by price and time, I think can be decomposed in three basic types or problems for the market owner for a certain period of time: - The absolute range to be traded. - A reference price and a coefficient(s) that will be applied to price. - The legal and or regulated limits or prices that will be applied to price change per time interval if any. I mean, that I think that the basic problem is the type of bounded interval; but once given that interval, the rest is pure manipulation all the time, because prices are offered by software programs and that implies the result is 100% controlled. As you say, if the FED injects liquidity as it did a few months ago, you will see a change in that market (that will be 100% controlled by software and the owners of the software). Look what price did last Friday during NFP and it was my last long last week. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But think, for instance in cryptos it is very obvious. Cryptos are a good example. See this chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have added a few of the cryptos with more capitalization. The candlestick chart below is an index similar to the dixie index, but for cryptos. When the fundamentals are ok, all the cryptos evolve very similarly, they have an extraordinarily correlated to the crypto index (the crypto index is the harmonic mean of 10 cryptos). BTC leads the index (and the crypto market prices) so I have omitted it since it is implicit to the index. It means, that as long as there is speculative intertest on a product, the pricing system that controls cryptos will do the same with every single crypto asset over there. Otherwise, their value would be determined by the specific and particular features of each project and how it evolves over time. When I wrote that index, I was looking for a tool to find manipulation in markets and I realized how correlated these assets were, much more than Forex. I had around 50 investments in cryptos and I immediately reduced it to one half of it. And I think that by the end of this year I will reduce it to about 10 because diversification is adding more risk to my portfolio due to the high correlation levels. Now see the main stock indices of the world and observe what happened during the COVID event. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now think why an isolated event causes such dramatic fall at the same time and a so similar PA over all the indices of the world. An investment should not have such a dramatic value change. And more if we talk about economies so different as France, Canada, Japan, UK and many others I have omitted. All at the same time!! These changes correspond to speculative pricing systems that vary prices more or less in the same manner according to pure speculative interests. I mean, if the product is lucrative, they're in; if the product yields worse, the funds go elsewhere. And if prices show that, it means that prices are controlled by speculators imo. Is BTC price given by the blockchain system itself? Nope. It is produced by each broker and the most important ones have (except coinbase that is extremely expensive and non-competitive for instance) the same platform (see Huobi, Gate.io, Binance, Kucoin, etc...). Try to find automated triangular arbitrage opportunities on your prefered broker and you will see how it is impossible, because they manipulate crosses to the extreme so that no one except them can do it. I have been running bots against my brokers for entire days and they adjust automatically prices to keep for themselves the price inefficiences due to imbalances. I know it is a bit off-topic, but I think that it is important to reduce the number of variables to look at while trading. And I think that supply and demand is not amongst the ones we have to look at when we are trading using candlestick charts. That we can be purely studying naked charts and get sufficient accuracy and precision.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I would say that there is a subtle difference between the forex market and the CFD and Indices markets. On the last ones, no matter the volume of the retail trader transaction it will never have any influence on the price of the underlying products. For example, if someone goes long with 100 million USD on the coffee, the coffee prices will never change or move for that reason. On Forex, it is different, in spite of retail representing only 5% of the market volume, prices move. They will move if the transaction reaches the Interbank System. They will move even more when intermediate Market Makers are in control, and most times they are even under ECN. Everybody heard cases of abnormal spikes never replicated on the charts from other brokers. So, for example, when we read that the market sentiment for Silver is 91% net long, Silver prices may indeed raise (unless the pool number are forged, which may well happen). On the other hand when you read that the market sentiment for USD/CAD is 71% net-long, the pair price may actually continue to fall for a while. I agree that there are bounded intervals. The long term objective of FED is make the USD stronger. But they have to deal with many competing interests in addition to the covid, the economy and the inflation. In the middle of that undefinition, Big Players of the Forex Market make their game against the short and middle term expectancies of the retail traders - this is how they make the money. In my opinion Crypto currency prices are almost exclusively manipulated by the big whales. The most important whales are anonymous, but the Winklevoss twins, Tesla, and a few other names have large amounts. BTC still has the largest market capitalization (MC), but other cryptos are increasing their MC at a higher rate. The dragging effect from BTC on other cryptos is less clear than in the past. I would not be surprised at all, if BTC would be dethroned sometime in the near future. Yes, I think that using indicators on a chart may cause more harm than benefit. However, not all indicators are really bad. In my opinion, the most popular ones are, with the exception of ATR which is useful for risk management (when the market is not trending).

Good morning, pals. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have been reviewing the chart and I am not going to short sell that level because the two highs are too flat to my taste and, specially, because the second high is lower than the first one. In that situation my guess is that prices may be running the stops above these two levels before they are allowed to reverse. I do not mean that is what it is going to happen, but that it would be the ideal scenario I would be waiting for before considering looking for shorts. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I arrived late. When I see the chart with so many wicks and noise, I try to switch to HTF. When you move up to 1H, there are a few support areas where long opportunities may arise later on. Attached Image (click to enlarge) However, I must say I really do not like that looong black candles on the left forming the downside part of the "U". I really do not like it, because all these shorts will be mitigated upon the descent, that implies that all that range could be covered. That is the reason I am not really fan of that asset today. See the schema below. I mean that my order-flow analysis is not really matching any obvious TL break structure for me. It does not mean it does not exists, just that I am not aware of the existence of it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Conversely, if we are observing that the weekly momentum is negative, be can also try to adopt a seller profile till price reaches the next strong support area. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This just means that we only accept shorting opportunities and reject long ones, just to be in line with the main trend and considering that chart is valid, of course. Everything I say is always only valid for paper trading.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Engineer - a couple of questions if you don't mind? 1) On numerous occasions you have recommended people use LTF price action to confirm HTF levels but no-one seems to be doing this. Have I missed something or is this just people not following your recommendation? That seems strange as I assume it will give a higher win rate and better R/R. 2) I get the idea of using the break of accumulation and distribution trendlines with retest of the break level as an LTF confirmation but you also mention break of structure as an alternative method of confirmation. Would you mind explaining what that is and how to use it - specifically when / where to enter? 3) Are there any other LTF techniques that you use for confirming a HTF setup?

I am tracking this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EU Gave me this scalp, so after offering buyside oportunities, I am less receptive to shorting opportunities. Meaning, I will not take any level on the short side unless strong PA confirms it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #403 ---
You are right. Using LTF price action to confirm HTF levels will statistically result in higher win rate for any method or strategy. But people are free to trade in a manner they are most comfortable with. For most people I think it is impatience and the 'fear' of missing the trade that stops them from looking for LTF confirmation before placing their trades. For me BOS is just price making a HH or LL into a weak area or free space (not strong demand/supply), as long as this HH or LL does not look like a stop hunt. It is important that after a BOS or the LTF TL breakout, price is retracing to a strong zone before the main move. I usually take trades after I see strong moves into my entry zone. Check posts 384 and 208 for more on this. Thanks.

I agree that the higher level was likely to produce a reaction. The lower M30 SR level should have led to a move lower and didn't which was a bit strange but, as you say, the CAD rate decision might have been the driver.

just stopped paying for monthly memberships - I got to month 7 and I decided I could not bring myself to pay him any more money. He promised so much for the mentorship ("I'm going to pour myself out for you this year") but delivered so little. Each month is supposed to be focused on a particular element to his teachings, and he promised to spend each video elaborating on the topics. But they were so basic and short (the only long ones were where he rants about how he created all this and how people are ripping him off) and devoid of the detail about each topic that he had promised. His excuse was "I'm giving you what you paid for" which is totally the opposite of what he was saying in the free youtube vids when enticing us all to join the ("the last ever year of mentorship, I'm never doing this again") mentorship. Plus there is a lot of Captain Hindsight going on in his analysis - one example, a few weeks ago he stated something he said would not occur in EURUSD according to institutional orderflow, and it DID happen. I had annotated the very thing in my chart, and was interested to see what he would say about it in the next video. Guess what? He'd changed his chart, and made no mention of it... that was the last straw for me. He spends so much time &amp; energy brainwashing his Disciples to just look at DXY, EU, GU &amp; EG. And limits them to the LDN &amp; NY Killzone timezones. AND makes his students alter their day to start at NY EST midnight, which is 7 hours into the trading day. I was always curious about this, but then realised its all part of his control-freak nature to keep his students limited and hanging on his every word. I could go on and on, but this is already a long reply. He is an insecure, delusional, bipolar man but who is also very clever and articulate. I do not question his genuine belief about himself, as he is his own No.1 fan, but, I have to say, outside of his basic teachings (which he did NOT invent, only appropriated from others), he has very little to offer the world of forex trading. So for those of you out there who maybe lamented missing out on his 'last ever' mentorship in 2021, may I reassure you you didn't really miss out - it's all there in his free youtube vids.

Hello, thanks for nice thread. Im curious if I can use this kinda differently with my system. It can be called reversed PriceAction. When I get my PC, I will check that.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi. I think he basically releases his contents very slowly and scattered in order to get students and followers. I think he loves being admired. Even the charter videos are quite simple in terms of ICT concepts. And that constitutes a problem because the student is required to test every combination in demo and/or simulated trading until a working setup/model is found by trial/error. For that reason I always discourage people when they want to engage ICT style, because very few persons are obsessive enough to face the relentless work that ICT requires. I remember the High Probability Scalping series and I think there was a 20-pip strategy that could be considered a basic trading setup. Other ideas such as the wolfe waves (that is not ICT) and basic stuff like that could be considered and end-to-end setup. But ICT by itself is good and the orderflow is there. The problem is the amount of time one needs to find the multiple needles in the haystack. The reason why he suggests using the killzones is because the impulse of the day for USD crosses may happen during LND and NY; while LND is many times subject to manipulation and NY usually is more reliable (that is why he released the OTE series on Youtube). There are many other details one needs to realize to develop a working ICT style over thousands of study and practice hours. We know that Michael, and he admits it, has a complex personality. Anyone following his Twitter or Telegram accounts or watching some of his videos can realize that sometimes he seems to feel unstable. But life is hard, very hard. Who can stand composed 100% of the time? I think that his personality is unimportant. I think that he is also leaking the private mentorship on his youtube channel, like liquidity theory that was a gem of the private mentorship or how to actually read the COT reports that I think it is only disclosed for charter members on his last modules, and I think he has also commented something about on his last market marker series (I am unsure about this last, I would have to review the Youtube MM series). I cannot recall everything, but I think he is leaking all that on his Youtube channel and Telegram group and that is unfair for mentorship students. Just to mention a couple of things. To summarize, imho ICT is not for everyone and it is not a system, but a set of teachings that one may use to elaborate a trading strategy. And no less than a couple of years are required to understand it. Betting on ICT is risky as you will forego the opportunity to learn simpler styles that might exist. In consequence, imho, ICT is only for very obsessive persons or for those who have a lot of free time and nothing important to lose.

Just a suggestion but, if you want to increase the returns you can make on each trade and also have a much higher win rate, you might want to investigate looking for LTF confirmation price action when price returns to that level.

I think the zone is OK but I'm not sure you are grasping the subtleties of this strategy. Simply identifying a compressed zone, drawing a trend line and horizontal line, and expecting it to produce a profitable trade isn't going to work. Price action trading isn't that easy I'm afraid. You have to think about context which includes things like trend, bias, momentum etc. As an example look at UJ on a daily or H4 chart. We've had a 150 pip straight line move - that is very strong buying. Do you really think you can sell after such a strong move up? I don't know your level of experience in trading but, if you don't understand context, I would suggest trying what I have outlined over the last week or so - find HTF locations and then look for LTF price action confirmation. Study the NZDUSD trade I posted this morning. Does it make sense what I was doing? Look at other recent trades I have posted and note that I have posted a HTF chart and a LTF chart. By adopting that methodology you can, to an extent, get round worrying about context so much.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Thanks, yes that is true. I am v aware I have lot to learn with discipline of sticking to a strategy, also I used to stick to only at London or newyork times, and avoid others, that would have avoided my AU loss yesterday. Also it was second move to black line so maybe this was not a valid time to enter? Re. AU I assume you mean the first move up to the black line in my pic was good setup, or the move passed it that occurred today?

GU has reached a historic level of Jan 2021 and currently showing good signs of a possible pull back. I am long here with stop few pips below historic swing low.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
This looks like perfect setup if price moves back..

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Sorry, but there are no "good signs" to be seen - this is what in times long gone by (when people still read books) was called a "falling sword". Despite the fact that I am all against bellicose metaphors I see the point in this saying. It may work out for you - who knows - but if it does you were lucky, that's all.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Can I suggest that you read post 489.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
on H1 i found sell limit on 1.3677

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Thanks Alien ..I have really learnt a lot from your charts. I have actually saved Engineer's charts and yours on my hard drive to go through again and again. Thank you for referring to post 489. I have read that again and it makes sense. Now, I have backtested this thing on multiple pairs and saw fruitful results in certain situations. This one on GU right now is one of those. I am not trading here depending on luck. As we all know, not all trades end up profitable. This one might be that. But after a fall of almost 200 pips, I do expect a pull back from this level. Please keep sharing your thoughts and charts. Those are good, valuable and very educational. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Just a simple question to you here josi .. Would you sell here?

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I've set an alert for 1.3673.. good strategy

--- 帖子 #514 ---
There might be a pullback after the strong drop but, if there is, it's going to be a slow and painful trade to be in and probably not the most efficient use of trading capital. Also very unlikely at this time of day to get a reversal of a major move. No-one seems that interested in using multiple timeframes for this strategy but, if you want higher R and higher win rate, it is the way to go. Less trades for sure but there's no point in taking losing trades just for the sake of it.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Thanks Alien .. what you said is absolutely correct. I completely agree on that. I am using M30 and sometimes M5. I have seen your past charts for MTF. Now that I have your attention a bit .. can I ask, what is the thinking process you go through when price reaches a level on say M30? Any knowledge sharing on this will be highly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I might not understand you question but the process I go through after price hits an M30 level (for example) is to next find my M30 target. I then drop to a suitable LTF to look for confirmation PA and, if I see it, I enter, and let price move to my M30 target and close.

Perfect! For some reason, your these examples penetrated my head more than your previous MTF examples. Thank you very much Alien! Highly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
it's simple stuff if you can be bothered to remain patient. I and some friends are trading the above strategy on the majors using H4 to M5 as our HTF's and you should get enough trades per day to do very well.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Of course .. right place to enter while waiting patiently is the key here. Trading just to be in a trade is ultimately disaster. I am still learning this strategy that Engineer introduced. I have understood (I think I did) what you told in above few posts. Now is the time to try it out. Thank you so very much for your time, patience and help!

A variation on a theme. It's already been touched on near the beginning of this thread but Engineer's orderflow methodology is a great lower timeframe confirmation of rejection from higher timeframe supply and demand zones.

Sharing a few findings as they might be helpful for others: 1- There are compressed zones on every TF. The bigger the TF, the bigger the impact. Keep in mind the SL has to be according to the TF as well. 2- Not every compressed zone means profit. Some will fail and stops will be hit. 3- Zoom in on lower TF once you have a compressed zone and find the inner compressed zone. That may reduce the number of trades you take but will definitely improve RR. 4- Look for current direction of price. If its moving down, look for compressed zone above and wait for price to go back there and then enter for a better/optimal stop loss. Same goes for longs. 5- Do not be over confident on any zone and trade only as big as the pocket allows I will share more findings later. Thanks

Guys just a heads up .. USDCAD is hovering around a very nice demand zone on H4 around 1.2540 area. Maybe it's a bit different on charts from other brokers but I hope it's somewhere around there for all of us. Take a look.

I use the higher timeframe for proper market structure and then go down to 15m or 5m for execution to give me good risk to reward.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I meant do you guys look for entries during the first few hours of NY open, or the entire session? And what's the max number of pairs do you trade? Can't be too many since it'll be hard to monitor them all correctly.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Depends on how you trade. I mostly wait and trade the entire session since I'm mostly day trading. You can trade any pairs with it provided you follow the laid down rules here. PS.No strategy is 100%, just fine-tune it to your style of trading.

Just remember that it isn't strictly about trendlines. A lot of people here tend to forget that it's about trading orderflow with simplified entries thanks to the use of the trendlines. We can't just draw a trendline wait for a BO and trade the pullback to the horizontal point of interest. I was testing a similar approach with my way of trading and this thread just confirmed that it can work. Also remember to just keep things simple, clean Your charts and train Your eyes to spot a good compressed zones.

Here is an example of what I look for in a Trend Line Break trade. This XTIUSD on M15, 1 shows where the up trend finished, 2 shows how price went back and tested that area and subsequently fell.

The orange line is the Tokyo open for that day and the light blue is London, black NY - price has a habit of finding these lines. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I try to look at higher timeframes for several reasons, the trend is stronger on them and you can clearly see the trend, secondly, it is very difficult to break the trend on the weekly timeframe and even the most liquid player on the market cannot do it quickly, and most importantly, I do it on higher timeframes fewer mistakes, the fee for which is equal a deposit!

On daily chart of the dollar index, I suppose that we will go down a little more to the trend line from the reverse side, and then we will make such an upward movement to the daily zone, which is near 50% of the monthly zone, so I’m thinking but I’m not calling you guys for action!, any way I’ll be glad to see if anyone thinks otherwise!

Ouch!! If you look at the OPS original posts and charts, you will see they have a lot in common with vikki75's charts. Given the OP appears to have lost interest, vikki75 is doing a good job in keeping this thread alive. Always a good idea to read the thread from the beginning especially when it' a short read.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Let's a little complicate the task of trend lines and add a few more conditions to trade profitably, I will not hide that I myself only study, so I need your help guys too!!!

--- 帖子 #696 ---
And so, the first addition is, let's before switching to a smaller timframe, we will draw a trend line on the daily timeframe on the last two corrections and make sure that the price did not break through the trend line, while we need to indicate the closest levels at the top and below we will use the price of prices From the left side!

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Yes, and I don’t advertise anything, I don’t teach anyone, I don’t give any signals and do not call anyone to action, everyone responsible for making your own decisions and actions that I would like just to figure out understanding how the price is moving along with you guys , unless of course you want it yourself!

--- 帖子 #698 ---
let's go to the first example on Daily chart!

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Then switch to the 4th Hour ,at the same time, we remember that we are looking only for buy and preferably from the trend line only Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #700 ---
so here we are on 4 hour time frame with clear zone to buy , with clear SL and TP Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Now your turn guys!

--- 帖子 #702 ---
the trend is your friend, until, alas, it ends... there is, of course (and as always) a different reading: a) the move down is the impulsive move b) the move up is the retracement c) the retracement runs into resistance and may be rejected (and may then enter into another impulsive move down)

--- 帖子 #703 ---
without any doubts each timeframe has own trend line and its own zone, but if we keep on this topic tread, we have settled the trend, now we look where on the lower timeframe we can find the entrance point and trade from the zone to zone!

what do you think guy's?, will we bounce off the trend line and continue to fall on the dollar index or...? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Hi Vikki, I think so, there is in addiction also 50% retracement and imbalance

--- 帖子 #721 ---
one of the options, we made a cross of the last extreme point, now to go lower we need to make a low low of the last correction and then we can say that we will have a head and shoulders pattern! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #725 ---
I marked my idea on the 4 hour chart by the S&amp;P 500 on the screenshot, but I still assume that before continuing down, we first go to test the evil of breaking through the 4 hour at the top, then to retest the 4 hour zone down and from there to the retest of the day time at the top and after that we will continue to fly down!!!

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Yes , I see that they are people just swearing into this thread just to look, without showing any activity in the analysis of charts, with the exception of a few traders, remember guys who sow poorly, reap poorly, the principle of the Lord!

--- 帖子 #727 ---
According to the dollar index, there is a daily zone below, it will be nice if we test it and go further up!

--- 帖子 #728 ---
I will prepare for gold sales from the daily zone!

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Same AUDUSD

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Ok guys I’m back, I’ll show screenshots from the daily timeframe and 4 hours, we will need zones from the daily timeframe and it’s better to make entries at 4 hours, the daily timeframe will also show the direction of the price until the trend line is broken, I hope this is clear!, so let's go!

Hello engineer, I was reading the thread and applying the strategy, and it has gone very well, my question is why don't you continue publishing? It seems like a great and simple system, applied with a market structure. I have some examples that I would like to share, do you have a community other than this one? A telegram group perhaps? Excuse my English, it is very basic.
