Hi everybody, I bumped into some posts on this forum about rainbow trading and nothing was clear how to trade it, so I started my own system. I'm just at the beginning of development of it and I start this tread in hope that others would contribute to it and would be open source, so good ideas would be included and tested and we will have a good solid system. Some software is developed like that and the products are great as is the result of many. ie OpenSolaris , Linux ., Firefox .... I'm getting very good results so far and I'll start to post them. Here is where the system got so far: 1. EUR 1 min chart with the WMMA Rainbow 2. EUR 5 min chart with WMA(12) and a trend line 3. Determine best time to trade (good volatility). Don't trade at news time; wait 10 -15 min after news. 4. Determine 5 min trend ( ie. trend line up &amp; higher highs &amp; higher lows &amp; price retracts and then passes the first peak (resistance) &amp; price on top of WMA(12) = trend up) 5. On 1 min chart price (thin white line) goes into MA's 6. Take the trade in the direction of the 5 min trend when price comes back from red with 1 mini lot for every $500 in your acct. and SL20, TP10 ; this is a 4% risk because the system has more than 80% wins. 7. Sit back and relax.

I traded the GBP today also, with 3 wins 0 losses. It was another signal later on both EUR and GBP, but i didn't take it. I was busy with something else. Results for today: 6 wins/0 losses, 50 pips, 12 % gain on the acct., $1,200. I think is not bad for two hours of trading.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Now I think another good entry would be when the price crosses on the other side of purple, but in the dir of the 5 min trend. That would be an early one, at the reverse of the 1 min trend.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi 4xQ, system looks very good. Could you post your Rainbow indicator? And, it looks like you are using an EA, Am I right? could you share it? Could you explain a little bit more step # 6? I don't get it when you say "Take the trade in the direction of the 5 min trend when price comes back from red ..." Thansk in advance MaSilva

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Sure. The Rainbow consists of many wheighted MA's (WMMA) indicators. I posted the template in post #1. This system is not an EA, but maybe we can make one after it is perfected. I trade manually and it takes many hours of screentime to get the good feeling of it. Step #6 At step #5 you see that the price goes into retracement, and then comes back in the dir of the 1 min trend that has to coincide with the 5 min trend, up or down. The colored lines are MA's. I'm taking the trade when the price (white thin line) comes out of red (MA's). Put the template in your template folder under your MT4 folder, right click on the chart and choose template...XP Rainbow...you will understand better. Cheers, Dan

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Nice system. I don't understand your trades though. Look at your 2 lots trade for the price of 1.5581 at 16:42. It closed at 1.5591 at 16:47. My IBFX price was never there. So how did this happen? Maybe I overlooked something? Different broker?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
This is a demo acct of FXDD broker. It has a server time of 7 hours ahead of EST (my time). I traded from around 8AM to 10AM. 16:42 is 9:42AM

--- 帖子 #8 ---
A long sesion today, and not a very good one. Here is the cable: 4win/1loss...20pip

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I tried the yen today also. 1 trade...10 pips

--- 帖子 #10 ---
But, still not quite sure I am understanding...let me take a crack here: If the red MAs rise above all the others, you are waiting for the thin white line to dip back into the MA's? Then, take the trade when it re-emerges? Thanks

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Finally, the EUR. I stopped trading as volatility goes down and the market is in a pendant. EUR was bad for me today...in the morning it picked up a bit then went sideways, then again a bit after 11AM and now is going nowhere. Finally...my last position just closed at target. Trades: 3win/1loss...10 pips on this one today.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Yes, in an uptrend that is already established on the 5 min chart and up on the 1 min.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Bonjour 4xp and thanks to share it with us. Question about your trade usd/yen You buy or sell when the red lines comes back so why wait until 16h56 to open usd/yen !? It was in uptrend before and the red line condition was right many time!? I maybe misunderstood the system

--- 帖子 #14 ---
So 40 pips this sesion...long one...8win/2loss = 80%. I still have problems with the signals before the trend reverses...I made two bad trades today on those...the trends were realy short...volatility low. One thing would be to use more indicators, but I realy don't want that...the rainbow actualy should tell you all you need. Anybody got some ideas?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
You're welcome and you didn't misunderstood. You are right, it was a very good signal around 16:00 (9AM EST), but I got the idea to try the yen only later, when I was bored....was no action with EUR and GBP One thing...the reds are short term MA's...my signals are when the white thin line (that is the price line) comes out from MA lines. You can change the white line into candlesticks with the button on top, but I use the line price.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Why a buy order at 17:44 on gbp/usd (1.9567) ?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
A profit of 15 pips might be better than 10 pips but do you think that this benefit would be feasible? What are your trade hours ?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I was thinking of that, and even more...that would get the risk/reward ratio better than 2:1. Has to be tested. If people would be willing to try different SL TP on different pairs and post it back here would be great. Also each market is different, the range is different. Initially I started this system for scalping, but I think it can be developed in a second system that would ride the trend, with Trailling Stop or step stop and the exit by some other means.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Your system seems really efficient with all pairs but with a sufficient volatility. I finally understood your technique 4xq TP to 10 pips but the SL could be lowered to 15 pips for the pair as eur/usd for example Your buy order at 17:44 on gbp/usd (1.9567) was a mistake, isn't it !?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thierry, I took that because the price on 1min just came out of the colors from a retracement, the trend on 1min and 5min was up, price was on top of MA(12) and just passed the last peak at 65. It had all my conditions, but turned to be one of the losing trades today because the trend reversed right after that. As I posted before, I still have problems with the end of trend signals and I need someething to filter that out. See in the pics....any idea?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
SL15 may work on eur, has to be tested...with good trend and small pulbacks may work. I try to trade when is some volatility, I'm a quicker. I believe that the same as with casino gambling, the more you are in, the more chances are for losing...definetelly not an investor...those are in the purple lines

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Does this uptrend confirmed by UT 5mn is valid for buy order or not !?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I found good volatility in the morning, also clear mind...from 7AM to 12 (EST), but has the danger of the NY openning and some news releases. After the openning at 8AM and after news if they have some release until around 12-1PM when markets go flat I found to be the safest. My server is 7 hours ahead of EST time.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I live in France so 8h00-18h00 (Paris) is a good trading hours for me 12-1PM is 6pm-7pm in France And about my question above on the usd/yen uptrend !?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Would be. Looks like the first signal in a 1min changing trend, if the 5min confirms. Crossing the purple in the dir of the 5min trend is a good signal for me, but I think is a litlle risky...I like to see the rainbow fan out a bit

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Then I think the London sesion is better for you . Just look at the markets for that, may be even better than after NY open

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Money management is a very important component of a system. Once, when I was a rookie, I made 100 pips and I lost money. Now I can make money with a 50% system. The key is money management and I made this formula that I use with great succes: TradeSize=AccountBalance()/1000*Risk/SL where Risk is the precentage of your acct you are willing to risk on any giving trade and SL is the StopLoss. It will calculate the TradeSize acording to your risk and stoploss in lots and fractions of a lot (minis)...ie..1.7 Lot For this system I made a couple of handy scripts that will enter a trade with calculated TradeSize for 4% Risk, at SL20 and TP10 pips. It will increase or decrease the trade size with 1 mini for each $500 in the acct. Use them on a demo acct first and at your own risk Good luck, Q

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Wednesday / 1:40 AM in France, I am tired so go to the bed I will test the 4xq sytem tomorrow in London session Bye and have a great end of day to you 4xq

--- 帖子 #29 ---
interesting.. thx 4 sharing

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thierry, I was looking at your rainbow and I spoted 4 entries on that. 1 and 4 are breaking the resistance and 2 and 3 are breaking the MA(200)...white thick line of my rainbow template. They are all good if the 5 min trend is up, but by not seing the 5 min chart I consider #4 the best because the new fresh 1 min trend did a pulback and then continued upward breaking the first peak resistance (top white horizontal line). I don't consider it a trend until it does that, otherwise may be just a large pulback of the down trend. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Well folks, today was a beautiful sunny session, with a great rainbow after the yesterday rain . Even the moon faze is in uptrend, growing towards first quater Years ago I had a sys that traded by moon faze.......it worked sometimes

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Today we had strong trends in these 3 pairs. This looks like one of those days when you can ride the trend, but that would be a different sys. Scalping is the wolf's strategy...it quickly bytes a piece and then retracts to eat that. I do that too, literally . After I take the trades I sit back and nibble on some carbs. Your brain is the biggest consumer of sugar in the body, carbs turn into glucose that would help your mind to work better for the next trade. The wolf is smart, he knows that. I used a different approach for entry today, and it kept me from getting in those bad trades at big pullbacks or trend change that I did yesterday. I draw s/r lines at each pullback and take the trade if those lines were broken. As you see on the eur and pound charts, the last sup. lines down didn't get passed, keeping me from those bad signals.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I think the eur and the jap would had worked today with SL10 TP10. That is a 1:1 risk/reward ratio and a 2% risk on the acct for each trade, or would had made double the money at 4% with my formula for trade size. The pound needs more room to breed, as has more and bigger pullbacks.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Later on got more signals. The s/r kept me again from losers....I was late on the last yen trade and as at noon wolfs and sharks (represented by the red lines in the rainbow) go to lunch (literally), volatility goes away, because they are leading the pack.....so I closed that trade at break even.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi Q, What is your trading period? Only London session? This is a really interesting system.. thks 4 sharing

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I used the 5min charts only a bit today, after the open, to see a clear trend. That is in the rainbow anyway. Plotted a colour wma(21) for better visualizing

--- 帖子 #37 ---
US session, my server is 7 hours ahead of EST time. I think London works better, but I'm done with night shifts

--- 帖子 #38 ---
OK, let's see the score....EUR 3/0....GBP 4/0....JPY 4/0....Total = 11/0....100% wins That leaves me with 110 pips....great day for me Happy trading, Q

--- 帖子 #39 ---
And that is with 2% profit per trade - 20SL, 10TP, 4% max risk@ SL - ? 22% profit for the session ? Cool!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
SL20...my formula calculates the tradesize by SL and procent of the acct you are willing to risk on a trade, so keps it at same level, in this case 4%, SL20 ie...$10,000 acct...TradeSize = 2 Lots...for $10,500 is 2.1 Lot....for $9,500 is 1.9 Lot Thanks, I wish would be like that every day

--- 帖子 #41 ---
looks wonderful but i don't quite get it.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Masilva, you're right about 2% profit too. For an SL10 can lower the risk at 2% and profit is still 2%. That may had worked today on eur and jap, as was a nice trend with no big pullbacks....or for SL10 4% risk, profit is 4% per trade...that would had made double the money. That is the miracle of money management.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Did you read the tread from post #1? Let me know what you don't understand and I'll try to explain

--- 帖子 #44 ---
sry but your buy script got a simple mistake in coding which it open a sell order instead of buy order

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hey Q, Since you're using line chart it doesn't show the High &amp; Lows of the 1min bars, so, do you wait for the close of the current bar to verify it closed above the last pick (S/R line)? or you enter as soon as the pick is penetrated ? This obviously change the backtesting &amp; forwardtesting of your strategy. thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Today I usd the s/r lines for the first time....entered as soon as the snake passed his head on the other side of the s/r line, but before, when the line came out of the colors I use to wait for the 1min close. This is still in developement, so we have to find out wich way is better. Any thoughts on that?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Sorry about that, I was too tired last night....I fixed it today around noon....download again

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Two Comments: Check the "Chart on Foreground" box in options. This will put your line chart on top of the MA's and make it more readable Also, If you Really want to use metatrader for this (most cyrox folk use Ninja Trader and go on 1 sec time frame) then Ikon Royal is best. Ikon has 1 pip spread for e/u and 2 for e/j Check it out. It really matters when you are scalping the rainbow. Mike

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanx Mike, apreciate...I use FXDD because I read somewhere that is an ECN desguised as a broker , so is very fast. I just use it for demo. 1 pip is great...I was searching for one ....I'll look at Ikon Royal Thanks again, Dan

Hi 4xq Really I appreciate your system but I didn't understand your entries on the 1 mn chart. Could you explain on a big graph with arrows how exactly you enter ? Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Here are the graphs EU this morning GMT. If there are entries, could you indicate them with an arrow and why ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
No comment

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks Your system seems to work fine also with another TF.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I use two types of entry. One is when the price comes back from the colors in the dir of the 5 min trend after a pulback, second....price breaks s/r lines in the dir of the 5 min trend. Second is safer and probably produces more pips. How do you scalp?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
It should...wich one r u using?..thx Have to go....bbl

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I'm trying to discover your system and I really love it. I'm thinking about another possibilities in 1 H or 4 H but I have to check before. Regards

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi ya'll, I'm back. Today as u see was another good day for the rainbow sys. ...in the morning 8:30 news pushed the $ up in a nice trend with the eur leading the pack,,,then the news at 10 did it again. I tried today a different approach, not scalping but riding the trend...not the wolf, but the lion...also used an EA that manades positions, with stepping stops...made a bad trade with the pound, as i took positions around 11:30, very close to lunch time..and a break even in yen again...I took an early signal and I got stopped out by a large pullback in GBP...my bad OK, now to differentiate this two systems that we have here I'll call them: - XP1 Wolfenstein (rock of the wolf) for the scalping and - XP2 LionKing for the one raiding the trend the kids will love that, soon we'll have a whole zoo

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Could you whenever you get the time explain the system when you enter long and short. Theres no real signs its going to drop as far as I can see, but I could be missing something.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I didn't study the 5 min today...it's all in the rainbow...helps in the beginning to see the trend more clearly, but I'll posted anyway OK, let's see....EUR 2/0...57+25 = 82pip, GBP1/1...49-20=19pip , JPY1/0...20pip Total: 4/1 trades...80%....131 pips for the session Happy trading, Q

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Plese feel free to post your results here...I may learn something too

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Now that you have found it try using it on an even smaller timeframe with bigger lots and watch what happens

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thx fx, I'll try that...the risk would be higher, but if I can do more than 90% I think would work. I was thinking to try bigger TF also for more like swing trading

--- 帖子 #64 ---
What do u mean by that?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Well to me it doesn't seem like there is. Maybe if you could explain how you enter and exit a bit better then you did before. Like on the weekend make a PDF like other people with systems do.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I do this every day on a 1sec timeframe with big lots, minimal risk as market exposure is minimal, and bring home amazing returns.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thx, it is simple, preatty and it works...people complicate things by nature, but I found that simple things work the best...trend and breaking the s/r lines are basic concepts, combined with a bit of fundamentals (news releases) and good money management. By this can even eliminate the rainbow and the higher TF and trade a chart with only a single line for price. that would be awsome

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Sorry, I don't understand what u mean by "signs" and "its going to drop as far as I can see"...could you explain in other words? You mean signals for entry by signs? Try to read the tread from the beginning and post #55 in special...zoom in the pics and see the round whyte circles are zones for entries...all r good cheers, Q

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Dude. If you really want to get the best bang out of trading the rainbow, just google "Cyrox"....

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Cyrox sells for about $600...i like to make my own systems, that's where the beauty is, in the journey, in discovery...that's what a real man do, achieve something great. That is what today's generation lost. Edison didn't buy the bulb, learn it or steal it, he tried thousands of times until succeeded. btw i'm an inventor too, that's why i have this mentality. We, people from the countries that got sold by US to the russians at the end of WW2, we received a great education, for free, and we didn't pay taxes, but we been forced to invent, was a matter of survival. I trade for fun, money is the second reason. I've been in two wars and a bloody revolution, you learn from such times what is more important in life. This life principles you learn, when you apply them anywhere, you will be successful at what you are doing. Without the foundation, the house will fall. Just some toughts, guys, I hope I did't offend enyone and I hope also that some of you r learning something in this tread. Have fun trading, if you're not having fun, something is wrong and turns into a nighmare sooner or later. Find the keys and use them on the right door at the right time. Burglars now this principles...entry, exit, keys, tools, speed, patience, timing...etc...at least those that didn't get caught Play chess...it will teach you most valuable skills. Q

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hey man I was looking at other forums on this kind of trading and found this and so far it seems like the signals this thing has been sending seems right, you just need to flip between time frames because it some times has like 5 or so arrows right next to each other and I'm thinking this is what people are talking about on it not repainting. I just figured you could look at it tell me what if you think its dead on or not.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Here are two examples of trades with higher TF. I use also the well-known indy Laguerre. In the first chart , the trend is down (white thick line). So I'm waiting for a re-emergence of red MAs and a Laguerre crossing below 0.85. There are 2 possibilities in short. In the second chart, the trend is up. There is a strong re-emergence of red MAs with a Laguerre crossing above 0.15. Laguerre is interesting for confirmation of entry. Long : trend up - re-emergence red lines - Laguerre crossing up 0.15 Short : trend down - re-emergence red lines - Laguerre crossing down 0.85

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Madscalp, Interesting! I was just looking at Laguerre last night, and testing the same idea you presented. Also looking at using it for an exit signal, perhaps crossing over/under 50 to allow a form of a trailing profit stop. I will be testing this further this weekend - please keep me posted on your results, and I will do the same. Sentinel

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I'm beginning now this way of trading. So I have to wait a little about the results. It's possible also to work with one volatile pair and different TF to look for the better entries. About exit, the best is when the red MAs dip again. In the second graph, it's true, the Laguerre is remaining above 0.50: so we can keep the long position. The more important rules (4xq) are a good trend and a re-emergence of red MAs.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
On this graph, we see bad entries with nevertheless a good trend because the Laguerre is between 0.15 and 0.85. The 3rd entry is good because the Laguerre crossed quickly 0.15. With higher TF, it's easier to take a trade and choose a exit with more profit. In my opinion, in 1m or 5m scalping, we have to trade very fastly: so when there is volatility, it's better to choose 4xq's rules ( 10 TP and 20 SL )

--- 帖子 #76 ---
No comment.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I guess lags are good for determining counter trend periods.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
We have the three conditions for short on the arrow but the following minutes don't confirm our trade. As long as the Laguerre indy don't go up again above 0.85, we have to keep the position. Finally, our short is excellent.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hello, it's look great sys. madscalp can you give to us lagurre indicator I can not find it in matatrader thanks alot

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Of course.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Great idea madscalp...I had the same, but I use CCI. I went back and made a comparison for entries Vertical lines (CCI crossing 0 signals) lg = LaGuerre signal from left to right #1 cci, s/r break, lg #2 cci, s/r break, no lg #3 cci, s/r break, lg #4 cci, s/r break. no lg (for .75 level, wich is default would had been signal #5 cci, s/r break, lg...price didn't come out of the blue...good for the wolf (scalping), no signal for the lion (riding the trend) #6 cci, no s/r break, no lg = no trade Looks that cci signals + s/r break give more trade signals and keeps you from the bad ones also. EUR 2/0...42pip

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Vertical lines = CCI signals #1 cci, s/r break, no lg #2 cci, s/r break, lg #3 cci, s/r break, no lg #4 cci s/r break, no lg #5 cci s/r break, lg under .15...good for the wolf, not good for the lion #6 cci. no s/r break, no lg = no trade GBP...1/0...57pip

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Vertical lines = CCI signals #1 cci, s/r break, lg #2 cci, s/r break, no lg #3 cci, s/r break, lg #4 cci, no s/r break, no lg = no trade JPY...2/0..10+28=38pip Session total...5/0...100%....42+57+38 = 138 pips This is getting better Q

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Sounds amazing....I use my formula to calculate the size of the trade by the size of the acct, risk % for a trade and SL. At my SL20 and 4% risk and $100.000 acct I can trade 20 Lots and make 2% minimum (TP10pip) = $2,000 on a trade. That's fantastic if would be 50 pip/day = 10%/day = $10,000/day That's first day, the second day trade size would be 22 Lots, third 24.2...etc At the end of the week the acct woud be at $161.051...a 61% grow in a week. What kind of risk do you use?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks sfOd...this indicator is fantastic....it picks the exact peaks and dips....used in dir of the trend with a filter for trend reverse you have a system. Awesome...I'll work on it

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Here's the source code in case you are someone else would like to tweak it.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
If you look at the 5 min chart the price action shows that there was a previous swing high, avoid taking trades going into swing high or lows as it was a previous s/r level

--- 帖子 #88 ---
An eye on the pivot point also helps to see potentil s/r barriers as eur/usd and gbp/usd pairs obey pivots well

--- 帖子 #89 ---
The elements of trading the rainbow effectively are freely available. I did not pay $600 to learn to trade it. The path that your walking has been tried and mastered years ago. There are two ways to learn my friend. On your own which is time and money, or from others who are successful. I choose to learn from people who are successful. There is one big fundamental element that is missing from your efforts but since you have the time, money and patience to find it on your own -- good luck.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Bonjour à tous "Super signal" seems too good to be true and I believe that this indicator repainted the past so take care Laguerre seems more efficient, less profitable but more reliable

--- 帖子 #92 ---
You're right, I should had waited for the price to pass that peak, wich was a s/r level from the 5min too. I fixed that the next day Thx for the input

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thanks, the thing is that I enjoy a good challenge, and maybe the result of this will be something different than cyrox, maybe better. I don't like black boxes like Autopilot that you don't know what is going on, I use to program computers and robots years ago. Like you say I have the time, money, endurance, patience, and I'm bored, I have nothing else to do, my EA's make money all the time. I used to trade comodity futures many years ago on paper charts, or I made my own paper charts, drawing lines and get the numbers from the newspaper...that was fun ...now with this EA's I'm bored to death so I decided to give back to the world...something everyone should do because giving is better than taking...makes you more happy....actualy by giving, you receive something greater, all the time...that is a very important fundamental each individual has to find for himself. As for the fundamental for this sys, I'll find it...that's fun thaks for pointing that out for me mate. Best learning is hands on, by experience, there is nothing that can substitute experience. Edison didn't learn from anybody, and he never graduated from grade school...same with Rokefeller...Charles Chaplin, and I can give you about 15 names of similar people like that. There are two types of people, leaders and folowers Cheers mate, Q

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Good point Thierry, should be forward tested, thx

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Now, this is the end of a good week for this baby sys...the score Trades: 34/3 =&gt; 92% wins =&gt; 469 pips I think it is pretty good for the first week of a sys in construction, but i won't go live for less than 100% Have a good weekend everybody

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Has anyone here actually observed it in real time? Unfortunately, I did not see this in the thread till after closing this afternoon. Will hate to wait until sunday night to know (but of course, patience is key in trading, isn't it?) But I am in agreement - appears to good to be true. Perhaps it paints several bars back, although, I have an up arrow on the last bar of the day today in the EURUSD. Will have to watch that once the market opens sunday night.... 4xp, what is your feel on the cci+lag? It does seem that the lag signals later, but perhaps less whipsaw? Interested in your view, and thanks again for the great thread. Sentinel

Thank you for this system. Are you using CCI 14 or 54? Also illustrate how you determine which peak or valley to use for S/R.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I take two guesses for that ...my risk/reward ratio is not great, but I'm working on that. SL20 TP10 I mean. I have SL20 there in case a war starts or the Antichrist takes over the world, actually my trade manager EA handles the stops, breaks even at the worst usually, so the stop is ajusted for each market. I use that SL20 to calculate TradeSize. Second: If you talking about discipline, I don't need to learn that, I am German, I have that in my DNA ...I trade like a robot....Mann-Maschine, machine d'homme, máquina de hombre, dell'uomo-macchina, om masina, машина человека, ember gép...etc Just western societies lost that and need to learn it again. the ancient civilizations know it...the indians, japs and the chinese will take over the world soon, in a way or another, but most likely economically. So, how am I doin' ? Play chess...when you're master it play GO...that's what the grandmasters do. Q

You're welcome Looks to me as you see in my today's 3 charts that CCI+s/r break gives more entry signals than LG, and keeps the bads at bay...the result would be more trades, so more profitable. Seems that LG gived less signals, so you have to wait longer, keeps you out of bad trades and is very good for exit when goes over. 75 in down trend or under .15 in up trend. If SS (super signal) works, I will use that instead of CCI...I am a fan of CCI, as works as an indicator and an oscilator too, depends how you read it...cross 100 or 0. LaG seems to do the same job, showing owerbought/oversold, change in dir...etc, but calculates differently Fwd testing will tell...if anyone tests anything please post it here, I'm sure will be apreciated by all

--- 帖子 #100 ---
You're welcome CCI 14...I put s/r on the last good peaks in an up trend and use only the recent couple ones, and for major s/r a good idea is pivots and trend swing lines from the 5 min chart. Gives good safer entries and keeps the sys not to enter in the loosers if a peak line is not passed. But don't take it if a major s/r line is just above, wait for that to be passed up or if bouces back = no entry. Reverse for down trend Works better until you get the feel for it toghether with CCI signals...cross 0 in the dir of the trend=change of dir back in the dir of the trend. Still to be tested more Cheers, Q

Hi. Just wanted to say great job putting together the templates.. I have added your setup to a setup I was already using and the final result is great.. Oh and I should add I have run this thru the athome simulator and there is no repainting of the past.. All past bars stay solid..

Great signature Mike, I love it "Don't store treasures on earth, but....." XP

Super signal is very impressive after installation but , unfortunately, in real time, it's totally different. Keep your CCI, 4xq http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif Everybody adds his own indy: it's good but don't forget especially in 1m TF we have to trade quickly. If there are many indies to observe, in my opinion it's bad. Let's try only an indy and remember the 4xq's rules: a good trend, a re-emergence of red MAs and an agrement with our favorite indy (CCI, Lag,etc) About the indy, we need especially a filter to avoid to take a bad entry. If, in the same time, it can give an agrement, it's cool.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi 4xq, Good stuff. I'm testing something partialy similar with a collection of mas (not a whole rainbow) and on higher tfs 5m-1h. What I would suggest to you is to use a better r:r, 1:1 should do the job. Basicly the main edge this stuff gives you is catching the beginning of a wave that shows good potential momentum. Thus, if for some reason the trade doesn't quickly go into profit the momentum is cut short and your edge significantly diminishes, which is why I don't see the point of having an sl any larger than your tp. Also, at least for EU in particular on a 1m chart 10 pips may be a bit high. Maybe 8 pips with an equal sized sl would work better. Another possibility, is to use the same rainbow on the 5m chart as well as verification instead of just a single ma, it may make it easier for you to see the bigger picture. Last thing I'd mention is that you could check higher tfs for trading this as well, for example I'm testing on 5m and 15m in particular and you can capture pretty nice moves that way, don't have to go for 1:1 even, you can tp half and let the rest run if you believe a bigger move could develop - for example within the 1-2 hours before London open there are often pretty big moves developing that you can take advantage of. In such a case you'll ussualy see the mas contract behind the price in their respective order and then a sudden explostion starts so you can wait for the first 5m or 15m bar to close and take a good r:r high potential trade. GL

Looks that I'm too naive, I trust indicators Thx bro, you got it. I try to simplify, as I found that simple things work the best, so a 10 year old can use it. There are plenty of entry points, like we had in the beginning of the tread, but to fine tune and maximize the profits we need an indicator/filter to eliminate the loosers and to to spot the exits in some way...for scalping TP10 or LG, for riding the trend Trailling Stop, Step Stop, or maybe LG on the 5min. About speed...I use this 3 pairs because they behave almost in tandem in the US session, having the $ in each...one of them is leading the pack, the yen is the last, eur and gbp take turns, but mostly the eur. When I get a signal in the leader, that happens shortly after in the second runner up and then in the yen. So is like seing into the future a good few sec. That's a golden egg from the goose . I used this technique on brokers, I got the signals on a fast one and placed the orders on one with slow feed...Back to the future. Also I use scrips to enter and exit fast, for exit a CloseAll is a good idea.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I'm working on London session and I use only 2 pairs GBPUSD and USDJPY ( weak spread ) I'm thinking an EA of your system is realist with a filter. What do you think about ? Are you a coder ?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
The picture does get clearer if you know what the upper TF are doing and where some of the S/R levels are. M1 Chart ILinear Weighted MA's from period 244 to 2,M15 customCandles, Daily Fiblevels, Daily opening and Europe opening line and WPR 50. You can trade 3 methods all of the M1 Chart. 1 continuation of the trend after retrace 2 breakout of a range 3 break of previous higher TF candle (entry4) I am describing one of the attached pic. in which we are in a down trend and then range bound. Entries 2,5,6,7 trend is established all colors of the rainbow are visible and going in a nice angle down. Price retraces (M15 candles blue) then breaks the low of the previous candle to continue in trend dir. Entry is the low of that previous M15 candle +1 pip . R/R =1:1 Stoploss the high of Previous M15+1pip + your spread. Entry 1 and 3 break of resistance where as in entry 1 is also continuation of the trend after a retracement. Entry 4 break of previous higher TF candle (WPR comes into play as assurance.) Around the entry 7 we can notice the flattening of the rainbow. Entry marked 8, trend is flat, 4 or more M15 candles are in a narrow range.Breakout can be either north or south in this case it was south. Often after price has been in a longer period of consolidation it tends to come back to retest the breakout line. If anyone likes to test this setup please be my guest. I've uploaded my Tpl and indicators. Enjoy!

Welcome GL to this tread and thx for the ideas. I'm working on some as i put toghether the new rules for Mon. You're right about rr when startind the trend, but after that it may go in bigger swings if the the trend is not so strong and traders take profits. Lately, if we exit by a signal from an indy, like LG, the profit is higher than 10 pip, as I had Fri...eur 22 and 20...gbp 57...yen 28. That brings rr to 1:1 or higher. Of course, that would not always be the case, but in a good trend would be true, with minor exeptions. I'm planning to use different TF (lower and higher) when this is working very good on 1 min, then higher would be piece of cake. I don't trade the London anymore, is night shift for me and I'm old, but here is an idea for you too...look at Wed, look at the pairs with higher interest as base and in uptrend....see what happens....the elefants go up in the trees and the whales jump up from the water ...they leave footprints and big waves all over the place. You're right with the closing half...that would be scalping with half and riding the trend with the other half position. I used this technique on news trading, and works well...that is like a wolf and a lion on the same kill You're working on the Bollinger Bands Rainbow? That's awsome too. Apreciate, bro....good luck

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Welcome, Pipo and thanks...those are great systems..I'm sure we can use your ideas here Apreciate, Q

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Pipo You have an interesting method but I don't understand the link with the rainbow. You can use it only in 15 m with candles. However I really appreciate your system. Your indy is Williams ?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
When this is finalized and works very good I hope I can code an EA...depends how complicated this gets...We need exact rules first...I'm fairly new to MQL, but I coded some EA's and I always get great help from programmers in this forum. 1 4 all Study history, especial in the domain you are interested...you will learn a great deal Q

Welcome B, and thanks...looks and sounds very good...could u post your indy's and templates? Apreciate

1 4 all ... Wednesday...pair with high interest as base...second curr low interest...in a daily uptrend...elephants and whales go in, and out after close....ie. USD/JPY...146 pip move The zoo is growing Follow the giants, they leave huge footprints Williams

Laguerre is faster and the best http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Why not super signal ?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
4xq, This is what I am struggling with....can you give me some feedback on how you would trade this area? I know it may be outside of normal traing hours, but these types of consolidations do happen during normal hours also... detailed feedback here would be great! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Out of the market, Sentinel ! There is no trend.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Same trade in 4 H TF. Already 240 pips and it is not finished ! This method is also amazing with higher TF.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Sorry for this, but does anyone know how to layer multiple indicators ina window (not the price window) in MT4? Thanks

--- 帖子 #119 ---
You just drag the indicator to the existing indicator window frame that you want to overlay with. Hope that helps!

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi Madscalp , yes the indi is Williams but is really not need except it helps with entry 4. I see the rainbow as a nice and easy to understand visual presentation of the past price action of which we base our assumption of the future price action. But to trade the Rainbow you trade nothing else than the thrust of a break of any higher TF range, trend lines or candles highs or lows, S/R levels , pivot ,daily opening price and so on. Why would one disregard such simple but effective info and look for indicators to tell one when it is time to enter a trade by putting dots or arrows after arrows until it gets it right. If one want to scalp on a short TF like the M1 you need to be in and out of the trade before any indiator can tell you. My observation is that the price accelerates when it goes past previous s/r levels of highs or lows of higher TF’s in the direction of the trend rather than the previous S/R levels based on previous close . If Price goes past previous close but not the previous higher TF high or low then you may find yourself in a trade you don’t want to be in it as it can easily reverse on you as the snake just showed its head and disappeared again behind the red lines or een worse goes the opposite direction. If one goes only for 2-5 pips profit it could be alright but then one would use a 5 sec rainbow chart on Oanda .

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I won't trade that period with this sys. First rule of engagement...have a trend. I take first sigal after openning, but there is a trend from before, resurected...like we had Fri, the trend started at London open.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
SS is best if works, I already made a sys with it Looks that you didn't get the golden egg, that is every Wednesday, when they pay triple interest...actually has nothing to do with the rainbow That is BUY LOW SELL HIGH, and maybe collect the interest on the money you borow from your broker LG is on that chart too, I put indy's only for u guys to see what's hapenning "Look at the big picture, they say is 1K words" Q

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Great, when will work 100% on 1min, will work in all TF

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Looks out that the wolf cub grew a lot in a week I made the rules for my Monday trading and is an upgraded version, so I will call it XP Wolfenstein v1.1 Rules: 1. 1min rainbow with a trend 2. Wait after open and news 3. Snake goes into colors and then re-emerges 4. Entry: #3 + LaG signal or break of s/r 5. SL=12 + spread 6. Exit: CCI(21) trend lines meet 7. Eat something and have fun

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Vertical lines...green= 8am &amp; 12pm EST red=entries (short), blue=exits, yellow=trend lines See cci trend lines how work? if they go in a pendant is time for reversal...if the price moves in one dir and cci in oposite, signals EARLY a posible trend reversal

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Better not to take last entry on all 3 charts, price didn't come out. would had made litlle profit or small loss. lines here: blue=entry (long), red=exit

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Great set of rules 4xq - thank you! I had a chuckle earlier when I read about you being german, therefore very precise. I am irish, and about as opposite from that as can be! Rules are essential for me... Question on your last chart....CCI is not showing as 21, and are your entry and exit lines accurate there? Thanks Sentinel

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Ups, you're right, should be cci21...works with 14 too I don't see very good and I missed that...I have to redo it...thx for pointing that Well, those are just the rules I'll try monday, so will see how they work Sticking to the rules exactly is esential

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I think I figured out a rule that could work. Lag going down 0.85 and CCI closer to 0 then 100 on a short. On the chart on post #125, you could of shorted at Lag 0.85 and when you look at the CCI going below -250 you exit, and it could of been ~40 pips.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I'm editing those, has to change

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Let me take back my last post, I think I found something that may work, but unfortunately, the Lag indicator only shows the last 16 hours. 2 Laguerres: 0.66(red[lag1]) and 0.80(white[lag2]). Levels 0.85, 0.15, &amp; 0. 45 CCI: 21 Short: 1. Lag1, going down and at 0.85. 2. Lag2, above 0.85 or - between 0. 45 and 0.15(needs more testing)- 3. CCI very close to 0(needs more testing) Exit: Still working on. So far these rules seem to be working. Changed some the rules, going to do some more research going to to calculate the possible percentage of successful trade and will try to get it to about 90%

--- 帖子 #132 ---
they look like they both will work on charts but in past i tried to use these two and they dont seem to line up with price action too well

--- 帖子 #133 ---
GBPUSD 84.77~% successful with the following rules.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
It's fine. Could you post a template ? How long tests ?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Well my Laguerres only seems go back 16 hours, so that's 16 hours of testing. Anyways here's the template. I'm also using another indicator that seems to show a indication that the pip drop will be low which is good because some of the spreads on the currencies can be as big as the drop.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
16 hours are not enough to conclude wait and see

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi, To see more of the lag, just go to the Lag properties ... Inputs tab ..... and change the count bars, I have mine at 10000, the Lag will them go back 10000 candles. Best to change it back after you have done research as it may slow the chart down if left set high.

Hey FXq, I guess you felt that explosion as well.. I was dropping off a friend on Yonge and sheppard at 3:50 last night and I thought it was gun shots, then we saw the sky light up and drove to wilson quickly to see whats going on, took some video footage, we were there with the 1st team that came to respond to the situation..it was crazy..people running everywhere and evacuating their houses. Coulda been a lot worse, the entire neighborhood coulda been flattened around there, we came out lucky..

Hi 4xq I don't understand your 1st trade: in 5m, the trend is flat and i don't see anything about the indies which allows an enter. Happily for you, the trade is good. The 2nd is curious too.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi 4xq, did you change rules in the first post or somewhere else? Could you post your updated template please with indies that you use now? thank you!

Hello! Wanting to contribute something to your system. This is a very powerful indicator signals, used with the rainbow in any TF, I will use in 4h and gives me many gains. I hope you like it, I say!

XP Wolfenstein v1.1 doesn't use the 5 min anymore I trade also based on judjement, not only indicators....that comes after lots of screen time...look at the big pic OK..eur #1...entry: price re-emerge + lag signal (cross .15 up) a few bars back + broken cci trend line that is not there, but in my head, a few bars back + cci cross 0 + s/r break I have trend lines and s/r lines in my head...comes from plaing chess, GO and pool...if get's too complicated i put it there, or for you guys to see it #1 exit...cci T lines break...not on that chart...in my head + cci coming from top, break downwards of previous cci s/r at 192 I look at cci like to a price chart, and is better than the price...it tells the future #2...entry..price re-emerge + cci T line break + cci cross 0 + break of s/r...price was laggind and fast..I entered a litlle late as I am a slow guy exit...I was tired...wanted to go to bed and looking for an exit...price bounced of s/r + cci bounced of overbought level + the T lines met, telling a pivot point in time gbp entry...bad one, but safe...price re-emerged and broke previous r level...peak + cci just bounced from T line...you don't see those because price was laggind...I entered intrabar as you see the entry arrow is way high...price was there (+ spread of course) gbp exit...I was late a few seconds from pivot time + cci comming down from overbought zone (previous s/r 202 level)...didn't have a next time piv, so I took that one. This is just like playing blitz (5min game)chess with 3 oponnents at the same time, in this case 2 (evennings I'm tired). I have a friend that plays blind chess with 5 people at the same time and wins all games...he has the master title....imagine the grand masters what kind of traders would be? I started trading commodities on daily paper charts and drawing lines, didn't have indicators, it's all in the price. Later i got indys, and oscilators...learned a lot from Turtle trading, R.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
We build this sys for scalping...I don't have lower TF than 1min yet. When works well on 1m, will work perfect on higher TF Enter when the price (thin white line) goes into colors and then comes back + indies signals or s/r break Latest rules on post 124

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Ok, this method is clearly a skill which takes work, and brilliant ideas. I've had successes, and then got my rear end handed to me, all in the same session. Let's keep this going and share what works. Is it time frame? Is it indicators? Can we fine tune the method? I don't know, but what I do know, is when I look at the rainbow charts, the direction of the market is clearer than anything I've seen in this forum in my years of daily studying. What is preventing me from consistant profitable trades? Please share as many ideas as possible until we figure this out. Don't give up this thread, test with small lots, on multiple time frames, and continue to share. To me, this method looks too good to discard without much more testing and experimenting. Remember, if it was easy, everyone would be doing it. Let's go!

--- 帖子 #169 ---
it works always better: 1. if you see clear trend hourly and hourly trend line is not broken 2. if volatility for current day already 50 pips at least It works well with volatility and in direction of trend...

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Exactly, I go in the dir of the major trend and I like to see the rainbow fan out about over 30 pip, but after a pullback and then break of the previous s/r...that's my definition of a current TF trend... I take somethimes the cross of purple, but in dir of major trend and confirmed by indies

4XP LionKing v1.0 sys Strategy: After the lioness kills the prey, the dominant male, LionKing takes over, loads up and goes to bed full Rules: 1m chart with the WMMA(2-200) Rainbow and CCI(21) Determine the major trend (look at 5m to 1H) Determine best time to trade (good volatility). Don't trade at open or news time; wait until price goes in dir of major trend Entry : - Price re-emerge from at least a yellow dip + break s/r and closes there + optional confirmation from cci, laguerre or your favorite indy. Use TradeManager EA to handle stops. Exit : After entry switch to 5m and exit on cci trend line break (close of bar) or trend lines cross time pivot After you close swith back to 1m Do this from your couch with your feet up and nibble on some cheese, breed from your favorite oxygen tank and have fun.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Study: As u get a bottom and u get an up trend, start drawing ray lines connecting the cci dip that coresponds with the price bottom with peaks and walleys. When u get a top in price and cci peak coresponding to price peak is lower than previous cci peak do the oposite, draw rays down. See what happens as lines meet.... CCI with fib #, ie.21 Works very accurate on 1m

After yelow time line...it's on 5m...not very acurate...rays have to be very precise placed as the longer they get, the more error possible In this case I had to adjust one ray, so the yellow time line/pivot got one bar sooner....works much better on 1m

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi 4xq Thanks 4 sharing and put your daily trade i have some question about examples : in post #176 1 . in trade number 2 in Eur/usd you buy , why ? and number 3 buy why ? in trade number 3 in gbp usd (Buy) , why ? in trade number 1 and 2 in usd jpy you enter buy (entry is diffrent from your rules (5m is in short and in 1min rainbow is not completely in direction of buy) please explaine it 2. what you mean by time pivot and 5m cci time pivots ? 3. please attach trade manager Ea 4. what is yellow horizontal line on your chart ? 5. How mucj is your stop best regards

--- 帖子 #184 ---
here's a useful indicator for res/sup. It comes up very clean on the rainbow chart

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Thx for that, apreciate....will test to see if get's my s/r's...I use the swing pivots from higher frames...would symplify and speed up work

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi 919, you're welcome...I'll be short...it is before news 1. shot in #176 is the 5m charts, I enter on 1m in this version...look rules...#177 + Wed are exceptions, maybe I was looking at the 1H trend, sorry, I can't pull the 1m history right now, I will try after my session 2. Time Pivot is the exact time when an event will ocur, the time when a swing in price will take place...I just invented this, I didn't learn it...I think is divine inspiration as I am a minister too and prophesy is a part of that...look at study, test on 1m Today I got this: If you combine price pivots (well known) with my Time Pivots, will get the precise spot in time/space (price) when an event will ocur...price swing....................................................... Major ones looks to be on the outside rays (upper and lower) This is in developement...please test everybody...and post back... 4. s/r lines, some from higher TF swing points (pivots) 5. 20+spread in LionKing 1.0 sys, set in Trade Manager

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hey 4xq I've been trying your method on demo since yesterday...just using the basic setup you shared on the first page. I've got eight trades straight with no losses. If the success continues I'll probably be trading this live next week. Thanks. p.s., I cherry-pick the signals...not taking every one, and I backed out of one of the trades early (with a couple of pips) because I didn't like the price action and it saved my bacon. blessings in your ministry bro, thanks again for sharing your system. ken

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi Ken, so you made ~80 pips with version 1.0...right on ....I sugest u test more on demo...about a month at least, as market conditions change...see the rest of the tread, it get's better, at least for me. I upgraded to version 1.1 and today I'm thinking of the next ver...4XP Wolfenstein v1.2...has different exits and a trade manager that can handle your stops and TP points in increments...I make more then 100 pips a morning session almost every day....last week was just the beginning...500 pips...we just made the sys here, we share ideas....great people Like you say, cherry- pick, filter the entries + my formula for money management ( I automated in a script) + trade manager + the art of exit = $$$$$$$$$$$$$ I'm glad it works for u, if I helped only one person with this, I'm satisfied Blessings to you too bro, Dan

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I see in the sec chart, first trade almost hit the stop...now we don't have that anymore, very litlle pullback and I trade 3 pairs....well you can adapt it as u wish on your style

--- 帖子 #190 ---
how many pips you make per week ? with this system

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Sent a message on your site Mike

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Got it....great work bro

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Thanks 4 your reply , please attach your chart of daily trades thanks

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Good work! I use 10 pips grid all the time As far as I understood you too?... I enter based on breakouts of 10 pips grids in direction of trend and rainbow. I use Ninjatrader for charting so I play 30 secs not 1 min Nice weekend to you

--- 帖子 #195 ---
4xq, I've just found your thread today and been reading it till the quote below. I've also been following cyrox method for past 1 week and have not yet mastered it (and I don't think, it fits my personality). I must thank for your contribution to this (trading) society and without a person like you, there won't be any advancement in man kind. As for challenge by others.. those people might just hv other motives in promoting their products.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Thank you incredifx, and you're welcome, I'm just an average guy in a big world and I try to make my contribution to it, nothing wrong with being a folower, we all are actually folowing somebody. The thing is in this bussines I believe one has to be different, original and invent something to realy succeed, use both sides of the brain. also adapt things for himself to be in the confort ZONE like you noticed cyrox won't fit your personality Good luck

--- 帖子 #197 ---
hi everyone firstable thanks all for sharing with newbies like me : ) i read whole that interresting thread the succes you obtained makes me jalous so i wanted to try it also as it looks easy ...... but so for me it was bad testing 4 losses 0 gain : ((( i think i misunderstood something about getting the good entry signal. and maybe about the SL : it's 12 right ? and there 's a lot of false signal that i am unable to see .especially on eu/us so maybe that pair isn't the best for now ? so the last point you where talking about " time /pivot " seems to be crutial to avoid false entry ! i am also a beginner with MT4 i am acctually using it for the first time just for triyng your system. so i have also no idea about what these ".ex4" files are made for ; ( i just discovered yesterday how to use the .mg4 ones !! thanks again

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Think about it. If you can generate 4 losses and 0 wins, that needs to be studied too. By just trading in the opposite direction you will have 4 wins and 0 losses. I say this in jest, but seriously, look closly at what you did, when you did it, and what the charts looked like. There may be something there which will help you turn it around!

--- 帖子 #199 ---
that sounds fun trying the opposite ) to be honest i used to think about it when i get angry against myself !!! thanks your are right there is probably something to learn on . by the way ,why the 5 min chart with the wma 12 as been abandoned ? it seems that the " snake head passing method " was'nt that useless .. regards

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I'm just halfway through this thread and tested a number of trades with good result (of course in demo platform). Hope, can do consistently in the next few days/weeks...

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I did that years ago, and it worked

--- 帖子 #202 ---
It is not abandoned yet...but u see the trend on the 1m rainbow...lately I use 5m it to get pivots, swing levels from there, just trying different things. I'll post new rules this weekend

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thanks for posting inc..Looks good. I see u took more than one position at the same time on the same pair. there are many entry points along, I was thinking that I'll do that later, when all rules are clear and working fine.... U had a big SL or no SL?...the market was swinging a lot...what time zone r u in? we had news at 9am and 10 am, I was on the bench for a long time today

--- 帖子 #204 ---
SL is 20 + spread lately, no wonder u got stoped out Try this: pick a time with volatility, wait after open and news for the rainbow to pick a dir...that should be the same dir as the 5m trend...don't enter right when price ceosses purple....wait for price (thin white line)to go back at least in the yellow...when comes back out from red, wait for the price to break tha previous peak and close there (1m chart)...put a SL at 20 + spread Exit at TP 10....that's the wolf...bite and get back...let me know how it is working The second sys that we have here, the lion, it has same entries, but is more complicated for the exits I use the time pivots only for exits of the lion sys .ex4 are actually the files that the computer use in MT4 for scripts, EA's, indicators....mq4 are the code files we humans understand and when u load it and hit compile in the editor, it generates a .ex4 file, so the pc undestand it

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Thu was 7/2...119pips I only made a few trades today, as it is fri and we had news at 9 and 10...after lunch I was busy with something else...score 4/1...63pips I tried different things today, I ploted fibs, pivots and real pivots from the 5m i tried one on the yen in the morning, but i got out right away...I didn't like it...the yen was flat today for me Legend: horizontal lines...green=past pivots(swing levels from the 5m)...colored thin lines=calculate pivots(pivots indy)....thick doted=fib levels vertical...white=open...red=time pivots I think all horisontal work for entries, when one gets broken after re-emerge I made a bad one in eur, i had the good entry, but the midle fib was broken just one pip...maybe not enough...than went back and broke 0 and trend line on the cci...that was exit for me, but I let it run to see what will hapen....tradeManager got me out at stop...I was right about exit Have a nice weekend guys

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hello 4xq i`m very curious how many pips you make with this system and what is it`s accuracy till now and do you trade it live thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Last week was almost 500pips, this week 553 pips....about accuracy...last week results are posted, this week is 37/6 = 86% for me...very bad, but that doesn't mean anything, with bad risk and money management you can lose money even with this ratio....ie 37 wins of 10pip and 6 loses of 70 pip = lost money You can't say "this system" yet as every day I tried different things...it is in construction...actually there are at least two systems from me here...try to read the thread

--- 帖子 #208 ---
4xq, my timezone is GMT+8. I was putting trades along reading your post and the winning so far was purely beginner luck. As for the SL I put it above the white line and this could be more than 20 pips. So it was a beginner luck to follow 5 min timeframe trend and it just works. I traded the cyrox for 1 week on 1 second timeframe. To me it was too exhausting and require high level concentration. Probably I haven't mastered it or the method just not suitable for me. With your 1 min timeframe, it's just right for me, to relax a little bit, but also not too long for less patient person like me So I would say, this 1 min trading TF is fantastic for me.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
4xq, I would love to see your rules this weekend Schoenes Wochenende

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi 4xq, how to use your trade manager? I put that inside the indicators folder and then I try to insert trade manager into the chart but nothing appears on the chart. tx.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hmmm. I think it's a script. Try it in script folder.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
that's really nice spending time to explain people how to get money !!!! i ll try it next week and i ll tell you . i have also noticed that most of the time when prices on 5 min chart cross the wma line (when trend changes on rainbow )you can get your 10 pips in the opposite direction . dont know if its safe but maybe it could be interesting to reverse a bad trade with an order placed above/under that line or .maybe it s just a stupid idea

--- 帖子 #213 ---
thanks.. so after moving to script folder, how do I attach it to the chart? I can't find anything to attach any script. thanks.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Ooooooops sorry it's in expert folder then right click.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
but I still haven't found way to attach that script after moving to expert folder. It doesn't work like indicator in which I can just add into the chart.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi 4xq, I just found this thread and have been skimming through. A year or two ago I tried learning the rainbow the lunix troll method. Very hard, especially when most people there treat you like " just pick-up on it and make it work" or your dumb. Thanks for the time taken to explain more in detail. I have two cents to throw out here. Wondering if someone could put an alert in the programming of this indicator "super signal". Would help with trading on higher TF's than 5M. Thanks for your time put into this. fxst

Dan 4xq. Great job and excellent support on all. Started reading earlier this afternoon and just finished reading all. Don't have anything to contribute at this phase, but will start implementing this tomorrow before market open. Just one question at this moment: Can you spend a little time in showing us how to program the Trade Manager??? Thanks again on a great effort and enjoy making the good pips, you deserve them.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
4xq, I think, the file is downloaded properly. I've not yet studied the meta editor but I believe, it's a compiled file. Now how to run this? YOu said, drag and drop? drag the file and drop into the chart? that won't work.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
In MT4 , when you put Display &gt; Navigator, do you see Trade Manager in Expert ? If yes, you drag and drop or right click then OK. Very simple.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
thanks.. finally I get it. It should be dragged out from Navigator.

I've just gone through the system and here is the summary. Wolfenstein system Rules: 1. Use only 1 min rainbow and trade in the direction 200MA 2. Don’t trade around news, preferrably ½ hour before and after the news 3. SL = 12 pips + spread 4. TF = Ride the wave till CCI exit pattern emerges 5. Preferrably trading time is between 8AM and 12 PM EST 6. Draw S/R, uptrend/downtrend lines on CCI Chart Setup: Rainbows WMA (2 .. 200) CCI (21) Lagguere (gamma 0.7) Entry: Price goes into color and reemerge Lagguere cross above 0.15 (long) or cross below 0.75(short) CCI cross above 0 line (long) or below 0(short) Exit: CCI exit pattern such as pendant. It’s time for reversal. If price moves in divergence to CCI, a possible trend reversal LionKing system Rules: 1. Use only 1 min chart (with rainbow) and 5 min chart (with EMA 12) 2. Determine the major trend from 5m chart and wait till price goes into major trend. 3. Don’t trade around news, preferrably ½ hour before and after the news 4. SL = 20 pips + spread 1. TF = Ride the wave till CCI exit pattern emerges 2. Preferrably trading time is between 8AM and 12 PM EST 3. Draw S/R, uptrend/downtrend lines on CCI Entry: Price goes into color and reemerge - don't enter right when price crosses purple - wait for price (thin white line) to go back at least in the yellow lines - when comes back out from red, wait for the price to break the previous peak/bottom and close there Price breakout from major s/r lines (5 min charts) as another supported entry Lagguere cross above 0.15 (long) or cross below 0.75(short) CCI cross above 0 line (long) or below 0(short) Exit: use Trade Manager to handel stop Switch to 5m chart and exit on CCI trend line break(pendant, etc) Start drawing lines connecting the CCI dip that correspond with price bottoms and CCI peaks correspond with price tops.

Hi 4xq, I attach a scalping entry based on CCI downtrend breakout. There were 2 Long entries if it's based on CCI however the CCI were still below 0 and this violates the wolfenstein rule. The 1st entry there are 12 pips to be made while the second has the potential of making 5 pips. I thought, this kind of entry could be used for scalping because if we wait CCI to cross above 0, and Laguerre crossing above 0.15, the might be too late. What's your opinion?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Is anyone having long term success with using rainbow for scalping? I am asking because I tried it with different settings for about 8 months in the row and I stoped because I was going nowhere in the long term (short term I had great results for weeks but it was luck more then anything else) as many others. However just because I did not make it work - not nesseseraly it won't for someone else. So is anyone having success and how long did you do it?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
A nice entry which fits all the rules.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Andy12, I supposed you use 1 second cyrox scalping? This thread is less than 8 months

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I understand that this tread less then 8 months. I just like to know is someone was proftable for 2 or more months in the row or not? Btw, I used to love scalping with rainbow, kind of miss it.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I don't use cci trend lines to enter, but to exit, those are exit points for me For the entry I need the price to come out from the colors and break some previous s/r This looks like a trend end...the price goes in a pendant ( I'm sure cci is in a pendant too if you zoom out) and the rainbow squises to 10-20pip, I woudn't take any entry in this situation... also i keep my grid to 10pip and I like to see more of the rainbow (zoom out) For your logic here, you don't need a rainbow, u enter based on cci and lag....it may work for scalping a few pips

--- 帖子 #235 ---
This tread started Aug 4, 2008...just over 1000 pips in two weeks so far

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I would take the next one, when lag signals, the rainbow is not even 10 pip out You are just at the exit when you took the pic...would had made ~25 pip

--- 帖子 #237 ---
you refer to when lag signal? And then are you waiting for a clearer breakout when the red rainbow above white for longer period?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
What are the optional pivot indicators and how to use it?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
currently I use fibonacci as s/r line and also an entry point. As for this example the entry was 50% fibonacci breakout.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
this trade is still running on demo. Take it because: - it breaks the 38.2 fibo on 5 min chart. - the price came out from 200MA for 2nd time to create break out

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Yes, when lag signal Your entry is 2-3 bars (minutes) out, not long time....the rainbow is thin...no volatility I said I woudn't take it, for me is too early, but each trader has his own style About pivots, I sugest you learn more technical analisys, the pivots indy is known by everybody, study is a key

--- 帖子 #242 ---
That's risky for me...you have no 1 min trend...~5 pips from your entry is the 50%, the price may bounce from that as 50% is the strongest fib level...fibs are projected levels, not real...the price may bounce of them or go trough them. I use real pivots, past swing levels and aditional pivot indy...this markets are obeing those. try it and see how it works, better or worse for you

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thx Freddy, here are the parameters I use in Trade Manager EA

--- 帖子 #244 ---
First target won't work under 10 pip Target increment...increments (steps in pips)from first target when EA will close how many lots you spacify on "Close Lots" First StopTarget...when you have this profit will move the stop to "First Stop" (in my case 0...break even) Second Stop Target...(at 30 pips profit will move stop to 10...lock in 10 pip profit) Third Stop Target...the same Max Loss...initial SL...won't show on the chart (or to your broker) I use this setting for EUR...hope this helps Q

--- 帖子 #245 ---
entered the trade at breakout level after the rainbow opens up. please comment what is wrong?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Nothing's wrong, how is the 5m trend? Depends what you want to do...get a few pips, or lots of pips...MA200 looks flat to me...today I stared at this type of markets for 5 hours...didnt take any trade....the markets went sideways, in consolidation If you keep the grid at 10 pip you'll see better that is no market, your rainbow is ~10pip open

--- 帖子 #247 ---
this is one of important rule avoiding sideway market. In any new trend the 200MA starts flat but opening up at later stage. The entry although looks good is not profitable at this stage. That is my problem.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Some of u may like this version of .... SHI_SilverTrendSig with slightly larger dots. May be of help on longer TF's. IMO

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I see the dots. But how does it work?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
from last few experience the best is to avoid trading when the trend is not yet formed. I've attached a picture in which the red lines crossing down the 200MA but the green box is the non-trade area. The simple reason: - All the rainbow colors are not in sequence Only after the rainbow colors are in sequence, we'll look for entry opportunity as highlighted in white circles.

If you look at my rules, having a trend is esential, one of the first rules

--- 帖子 #255 ---
4xq, I hope, you don't feel, I'm messing up with your thread. I'm new to forex and look for any opportunity to learn from many in this forum. cheers

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I'm going back and looking at some of your previous charts. What are your arrows you put on them symbolizing exactly? Also I'm a little confused on how you are determining the 5min trend..could you go over that a bit (sorry for asking you to restate yourself)

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Monday was horible for me, markets range bound, sideways, probably in expectation of the important news Made just 2 trades...35pips I tried last night a couple again and left it overnight with the Trade Manager...I put a magic number and it did't take the profit at target but at SL, so made only 20 pip Today we had the PPI pushing the $ up and Building Permits down, after a while the EUR and GBP went up, the yen range bound. I tried to trade on 5m, that's why my first ones look so bad, late on entry, late on exit. I tried one in yen and was a bad idea, I lost 10pip Last EUR would had been a winner, but I entered late...ended with -5pip Score...9/2....105pip

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I presume this was intended for me I determine any TF trend like this: price makes a bottom, then goes up, then retracts, but doesn't surpass the bottom, then goes up past the peak that made earlier. Reverse for downtrend. faster is to look at MA(34) in Color for the 5m TF, it is an indy I found on this forum Can you specify the post # with the arrows? I hope this helps Q

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Thx, I tried and doesn't plot any new dots on the 5m, just the past dots...any settings I'm missing? Thx

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Post #2 &amp; 11 sofar I guess once I understand what they are doing i can get more

--- 帖子 #261 ---
You better not, cause I'll hunt you down to the end of the world Learning is good, i hope you don't get offended by my opinions, I'm just sayin what I would do, take it or leave it, I thought you will learn this way. maybe I'm not a good teacher, I'm old school, they used to beat us up in school...it worked

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I see, those are the trades I took. Blue arrows are long entry and red are shorts, the triangles are exits. This is the default in MT4 platform

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Ahh ok ty, I've been using dealbook atm. I'm new to trading say a month or two but I'm picking up quick Right now I'm trying to see the viability of .00 levels and setting entry orders with the trend about 15 pips above/below them and having the momentum carry me. Have any experience with that?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I didn't trade like that, but I use this in the systems. Round numbers are known to do that many times, there is lots of activity there, as some take profits after the level breaks and others load up after break and retracement. this is hapenning also at the pivots and previous swing levels from higher time frames...we see a price acceleration at break and then retracement under the level, then break again...that's a usual scenario. It may be a change in direction, but usually there are signes before that Also each pair has a level (ie x.xx75) where they tend to go

--- 帖子 #265 ---
hmm ok I'm looking at some stuff for E/U today.... Wondering if this would be viable in the long run since there has been owhat 2 months of testing sofar? and summer months at that also, what is the exit strat? I'm not going to take a guess lol also also, do we wait for the full rainbow to extend and be in the proper color order? If so then that eliminates alot of scalps

--- 帖子 #266 ---
This is not 2 months, but 2 weeks old...please read the entire tread...you get all the rules posted and is still a work in progress. test it and please post back I don't wait for a full R., but for a trend...depends what you understand by scalp...first version here is finished and "scalps" 10-12 pips, the second one more than that and i don't consider it a scalping sys Q

--- 帖子 #267 ---
ahh sorry I got confused lol. well I guess I'll test this system myself and I have read the thread. The problem with looking at someone elses entries are that you do not know their thought process behind it.

Read this today, scalp myself using price action and rsi so thought this would be something to look at in between rsi extremes on the 5min. First attempt, captured it as it developed , hope i followed it right, was on my live account, demo wont teach you the stress or nerves

--- 帖子 #272 ---
jame it looks to me like you took that a little early, the red was not even poking though yet...

--- 帖子 #273 ---
when you're talking about the top white horiz line here you are talking about the previous peak correct? Of so I don't see how #4 broke that..(atleast yet in that timeframe)

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I didn't buy until i seen the red, thats why i bought 2 pips above the first image. The screen shot was 1 min before i bought, just showing that i was aware the setup was coming and was ready for it. Wanted to show what it looked like as it developed and finished. Showing a trade 10mins after it has gone good is easy to do, especially on 1min where indicators can change very quickly.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
ah ok btw where did you get the indicator showing the daily range/prev daily range, open/close, and the pivots, I'd be interested in that very much!!!

hmm what would be the best to set the pivots at tho, I haven't been in this long enough but will the coincide with gmt = 00:00 the whole year or what will happen when DST wears off? Also is there anyway to create this rainbow indicator in dealbook? I know these are a bunch of WMA's, correct? how could I put them in it? Just copy the moving averages from the template? ALSO: my IBFX 1min and RJOFX(dealbook) 1min do not look the same... I'm just looking to have the best demo charting software...any idea what the prob is?, I know its not that big a diff, but oh well. I already have an ECN broker so thats taken care of

Trade today off Asian Open, EUR/USD Long 00:07-08 GMT @ 1.4752 T/P @ 1.4767 (+13pips after spread) -- once RED retracted to YELLOW around 00:35 as of 00:45 could have let the trade ride for a current +24 pips, You also could have reentered when it passed the previous high of 1.4771 and came back from YELLOW ! as of right now that trade would be +7 pips. - a hammer is forming on 5min and we are nearing Fib R1 so watch for POSSIBLE REVERSAL Look at your charts from 00:00 gmt - 00:49 gmt to see this trade I can't post pics right now...shower time

You have to mention post number, I have no clue where is that

Who you talking to?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I was talking to james about the indicator and the post # is 30

--- 帖子 #283 ---
OK, guys, I'm back from sailing. Last night I set up 3 trades and left them with the Trade M....made 20pip...this morning before I left I couldn't help it and I set up another 3 and left it with TM again and went sailing...made 60pip So this Wed, just 5/0...80pips in semiautomatic mode and having fun.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I see, I presume then that you want an answer from him Please mention who you talking too and refer to post numbers when you ask questions Thx, Q

--- 帖子 #285 ---
4xq, u have a good life went sailing and still making money automatically haha

--- 帖子 #286 ---
4qz I was asking you about your analysis in post #30, usually all questions are directed towards the thread creator unless its convo within a thread in a small time frame also I see that EUR/USD trade but what made you get out of it when you did? I would have got out, then waited for it to retract and break the previous resistance

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I have been porting this rainbow technique to 1 second timeframe for fast scalping. I've been profitable over past 3 days. Of course I'm not looking for big swing but rather than a swing of 5/6 pips on high leverage. in 1 sec TF I use purely the rainbow.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
incred, how do you even get 1sec charts? I dont think ibfx has that option

--- 帖子 #289 ---
you can use free ninja trader software: http://www.ninjatrader.com and then u need to hook to a server. U can create a connection to free ninja trader server to get the feed. It's a tiring activities because u need to constantly monitoring each movement. Of course your stop loss should be 5/6 pips with profit target of 5/6 pips (first half) and let the other half running.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Yes, the previous peak. I'll tell you how #4 broke that. In this business one has to see into the future. Try this, put a chart on your screen and without looking at it cover the right half. Then trade...move your cover bar by bar to the right until u get an entry and so forth..... This is my old paper charts trading simulator/ exercise. In that chart, post 30, the man didn't capture the break in the pic, but he put there an entry....that means it was a break, just he didn't get it in the pic. Those were not trades taken, just posible points of entry on a history chart. If you go back to that time the chart will confirm what I'm saying here, I'm sure it broke that level.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
You don't want my life...no family at all I didn't said anything about the EA's that run on live accts , this was just sailing trading ( semiautomatic), that's why I made half the pips I should...it was probably a litlle luck too...actualy I know very good what goes on Wed...T-Rex and big animals, remember?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
My charts dont go back that far but I found another chart on here of that entended in time. Now I'm wondering about your trades today. I don't understand the exit of the E/U (why it was held when red retracted back to yellow). G/U doesn't look wise to me. I don't understand the U/Y as well, I would not have shorted at the red arrow, instead I would have shorted later once Support was broken. Also whats TM? Trade Management?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
That's what cyrox folk do, I heard, with high lots. I presume one have to be very fast, right? Not for me

--- 帖子 #294 ---
exactly. I try to find best result with 2 different TFs. one is those in seconds and another in 1 min.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
You're right, nothing is wise there, computers are the stupidest things u can get , only the entries are, those are mine. I just called this sailing trading...you entry the markets and then you go sailing on the lake or to bed. the idiot computer takes over and makes you half the pips you would had made. Don't try this at home I had the TP set at 20pip, that's the exits, the Trade Manager EA did it. I entered the eur right, then the pound because the eur was leading and the pound folows, they move in tandem. took the yen because came out and was breaking some s/r and had no major thing ahead + the yen is the last to folow this pack of wolfes, he is slow, eur and the cable take turns and the jap folows. More important, it was the magic day of Wed Actually, this is the first sys we had here, 4XP Wolfenstein v1.2, it has a TP of 10-12 pip, but it was Wed, that's why I set TP at 20

I was not at this helm, but at the real boat helm. Look what hapenned...price was in an up channel with flares out on the up side. That for me is sign of trend stenght, the buyers are stronger, also didn't break the low line (trend line), meaning the sellers don't have enought strenght. The computer was not so dum after all, or was just lucky. For trend change I see cci going in a pendant, then breaks out of that, or price move up and cci down for small retracement

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi 4xq ! Can you post your latest template with CCI. I've got one without CCI from the first post.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Great short today after 08:30 news around the time of 09:10 and then again breaking S/R at 09:42, about 5-9 pips of the first trade up to 29 on the second, 20 pips with YELLOW crossover exit

--- 帖子 #300 ---
sofar I've been using the original method in post #1, should I switch the WMA 12 to the MA 34, and by MA i assume you are talking about Simple MA 4xq? I'm trying to take in as much info as I can.. I am recored the london open to NY close everyday so I can actually go through in real time and watch the charts. Playing back at 8x speed I can go over 13hrs of market data in prolly 2 hours. - Speeding through news times will speed that up too. I'm wondering tho is post #1's method is now obsolete and if I should be using the CCI and Lagrange... I don't like having so many indicators... I tested yesterday a bit and did fine with just placing S&amp;R's on 1min and using them for Entries, the Exits are the tricky part for me if it breaks past the 10pip T/P or starts to reverse from that

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Maverick731, what kind of program do you use to record the market?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Great sesion for me today, compensates the yesterday's sailing Last trades I had 2 lions on eur and cable and one on jap and I closed them all with one shot

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Took a hit, the TM took me out at -24, I should had closed at trend line and 0 break or let it run to come back, but I had the computer interfering with my afairs ...got back in after

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Just 2/0 for the yen lion Total 12/1....174 pips for a Thu with 75% full moon Imagine on a full moon?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I use cci from mt4, just put it on the chart

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Wich market? Sounds good, can u post a pic?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
All MA are Linear Weighted, the 34 is an indy found on this forum called "MA in Color" great idea wirh the recording....Latest rules, developements in post #228-229...s/r lines and pivots are best for entry for me 2 Try the Wolf first...makes 10-12 pip a trade and after you get it good try the Lion...here exits are an art

--- 帖子 #308 ---
btw how are you using CCI's to exit the trade? I'm drawing the lines and the flags are developing themselves, just wondering how you're doing it BTW: can you please share your daily avg range and Pivot Point indicators. Mine are ok I just wants to test them vs yours. Btw I guess its because I'm new but I just finished testing the CCI... Its ok but I don't like it for the Wolf system, I found most of the time the trade went to the T/P Sorry for all the questions. But also you T/P is set to just 10 pips right? then spread is taken out of that, or do you add the spread to your t/p so that you actually get your 10 pips?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I use the swing levels from 5m or bigger TF, but the last 2-3 ones and the top and bottom of a move. also the strong ones are those levels that mach more than one swing or you see many candles stop there.... strong holds I don't use lag, my favorite is cci

--- 帖子 #310 ---
With cci when it is a pendant and it breaks out of a pendant against you, or toghether with breaking a 0, 100 level, depends where the pendant is. I don't use cci for the Wolf, the exits are TP 10-12 pip That is the best start, you focus first on entries and practice that, later when you got it good you can move to lion, get the art of exit there is no shorcuts in this business, one has to go trough the fazes. It is like trying to do algebra without knowind aritmetics....it's up to you...just my opinion 4XP Wolfenstein works better in a swinging market, we don't have a clear trend all the time, it may make more pips...entries are the same for both. 10 pip TP is 10 pip profit, the spread is taken out My pivots indy attached Please post some testing shots

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hello 4qx! I would like to ask you if you would be so kind and post some screenshots with marked your entry/exit points for your session. It would be great lesson for me and for others I think also. Today I made about 30pips (only 2h) using your method but I'd like to be better using it Thank you!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hello! I've added to your template DIGISTOCH and GMACD to see long term trend.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
have you tried it on logarythmical chars? how does this compare to regular ones?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
so Wolf's S/L has been lowered from 20 to 10? If so thats better because after spread it would have cost 20 pips for a loss, and for a win given up 8 pips with say EUR/USD. That would mean you have to do better than 70% to even BE. But now If the S/L is 10 pips it should be much better I guess the S/L should be dependent on the market tho

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Can you post these indies for us? Thanks

--- 帖子 #316 ---
good for you pug...I post my trades pics almost every day...you must be at beginning of tread We have two systems now Latest rules, developements in post #227-228...my advice is to start with the wolf, that was the initial idea, scalping

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Yes of course. Attached here.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Wolf on those post #'s (227 or w/e) uses CCI as exit :/ I guess if it doesn't hit our 10 pip T/P then we use that as exit to avoid a 20 pip loss? or a 10pips loss? BTW how are we using ATR to calc S/L?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I'm done for the week...not bad Fri...EUR 2/0...27pip

--- 帖子 #320 ---
GBP...2/0...73pip

--- 帖子 #321 ---
JPY...2/0...50pip

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Finally, my goal...100% Fri score: 6/0...150 pips Total 4 the week: 34/3....92%......544 pips...over my 500pip/week goal

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Sorry, yes 4XP Wolfenstein v1.2 is in post #227 I think if exit is on cci trend line break will never hit SL20. SL10 is too close for my taste...Test it, see wich one is better, TP 10-12 or cci. Please post back the results I don't calculate SL and I know this pairs. I look at atr somethimes, I don't calculate, it is different for each pair and time frame. My trading is not based on calculations, but on experience and judgement, I let calculations for the computers...those are good at math. One has to use both sides of the brain

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Anybody has a script that would close the trades in one pair? I lost a bunch of pips today closing one by one. I have one that closes all trades, don't need that. I don't have the time right now to make one. Thanks, Dan

--- 帖子 #325 ---
.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Thank you lavalle, apreciate...that was fast

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I just tried it...it closed all positions in all pairs...is there a setting to close just the orders in one pair?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
So 4xq, you want to either exit on +10 T/P or on CCI crossover of a trendline on it... A cross over of the CCI on the 1min correct? I did some testing yesterday with this and the thing is, the CCI tended to get me out of the trade earlier than I should have and the trade ended up going my way, in no way did the trade end up going against me... It'll take more thorough testing tho And I replay back data soon enough BTW: why are your charts now M2/M3 timeframes?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
also this shows 3 trades... The 2nd trade looks to be a failed trade that went past S/L and then B/E. The first trade I don't understand other than that green line is S&amp;R I guess. You should really count that BE as a draw and not take it away as a win... lying to yourself is the worst thing to do in trading, it starts a downhill slope

--- 帖子 #330 ---
hi 4xq, do you mind telling what time you are trading (GMT if possible) and which pairs? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
4xq, u attached a pivot indicator. It has the timezone variable set to 5. If I use GMT timeframe what is the variable?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I don't know, I don't have instructions, for EST TZ 5, for my server 7 works, I would try 0 for GMT That is the time of calculation, so it is up to you when you want the pivots to be calculated...you get a vertical line at the time of calc. so you'll know I calculate at 0 EST, so I get a line at 7 am...also prints on chart top the times

--- 帖子 #333 ---
TF is 1m....M1/M3 is printed on the chart by the pivots indy Can u post a shot? I have no idea how u draw the trend lines on cci cci cross over of trend line and some 100 or 0 level on 1m What do you mean by "earlier than I should have" earlier than TP10?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
This server (FXDD broker) is EST -7, so should be GMT -2 It makes the open/close of day (my TZ 17:00 EST) to be 0:00 eur, cable and the jap

--- 帖子 #335 ---
U need to read the tread from the beginning, we have two systems here, latest rules post #227-228

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I trade now with the lion sys, technical and fundamental combined and I test things all the time, that's how I improve a sys. A trade has not failed unless closed with a loss. I turned off SL because my inspiration told me that the trend should continue, (I see the future , I am also a minister with a prophetic gift) and HE was right. 4XP LionKing is only v.1.1 and still needs improvement....maybe i will eliminate or get SL bigger in the next version there are 3 trades on eur, 2/0 means 2 wins, 0 losses ...if you look at post #325 you'll see the BE...I don't count the break even's...2+0=2...there are 2 trades counted and 3 trades on the chart first eur entry...price crossed purple in dir of the trend (very strong) and crossed 2 important s/r...very clear entry

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Yeah I also use FXDD but which time you start and end your session, meaning which are ebtter trading times? or there is no limit?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
That sounds very dangerous. There will be the day when you won't be right. And it's gonna hurt.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
exactly what I'm saying and also its best to be subjective, you did not have a 100% win rate friday, you need to count those Break Even trades... do not start lying to yourself. Thats basicly like holding onto the trade in hopes it'll reverse, the first thing you learn not to do. You should atleast place a stop slighting above the previous high, because one day with a spike caused by the BIGGER MOVERS THAN YOU will cause a day or more of profits to go out the window. Its a great developing sys/method don't get me wrong but it looks like you are starting to walking into a pitfall.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Its called a daily chart, you really don't need a stop loss when you can analyze the daily chart and conclude that there is downward trend if your selling or a upward trend if your buying.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
And your analysis is never wrong ? The trend will never break ? And unexpected event will never occur ?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
?.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
psychology is never wrong

--- 帖子 #344 ---
For me was a 100%, a break even is a win, acording to the principle that say "don't ever let a winning trade to become a loser", so if it's not a loser is a winer, but I didn't count those trades as wins. So how you would count them in a win/lose ratio wich anyway doesn't mater because I can make money with a 50% sys or lose money with a 90%? When I was a rookie I use to think like you...traders that know what they are doing are not using SL, that's why they are the 5% that take all the money. This traders are so confident, that they don't need a SL.... that comes after many, many years of experience, I put a SL mainly for the case of technical failure. I placed a SL in this systems for you guys. I was holding to the trade not because I was hoping, but because I knew it will reverse. I made a fortune buing when the market was going down and piramiding, years ago, in comodities...can you do that? I also made a sys that is risk free...when you will do that you can give me advice I don't recomend to anybody to trade without a SL until you are in the 5%, after you make lots of money every year for a few years Also a day of profits going out the window doesn't mean anything to me, losing is part of trading, same as death is part of life...if you can't take a loss you are in trouble, you are not prepared to trade...the profits in the long run is what it matters Each trader develops his own trading style acording to his personality, principles and priorities, and if my style doesn't fit you, please don't folow it. I used to be a professional gambler, I'm a calculated risk taker, but i didn't implement that in this systems, i tried to make it as safe as posible, because i knew a lot of rookies and free lunch people will read this. That doesn't bother me, i do this to help, I don't need this sys, I can make a sys every other week and all make money

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Think..... The difference between Edison and Tesla is that Edison was an inventor and Tesla was a more than that, a discoverer, one that deared to go where no man has gone before, and was pulled back by people with limited minds. Tesla gave us 700 patents, he was first to harness Niagra Falls, gave us the radio and wireless comunication, the AC current, the AC motor, the bladeless turbine, the particle beam, sending power without wires and tapping into the free energy around us. When he did that he was shut down by J P Morgan, because was no money in giving people free energy. Now the science went back to his ideas and they have lasers and all kinds of particle beam aplications, they can change the wheather and tap into the free energy in the ionosfere. Soon your cell phone will be charged without wires and there is already a wireless desk lamp in production. See, Tesla was a man ahead of his time, same as Leonardo, Columbus, Jules Verne and many others that where risk takers and saw into the future. I will call that divine inspiration for some of you to understand. In my book it is called the gift of prophecy. That eliminates risk, because you get the future from the source, God, and you can get confirmations from calculations or signs. If you have God on your side in anything you do, I mean good things, you will have success in that, but the credit goes to HIM. ie... if you trade to use the money for your little selfish life or a bad porpose, you will lose in the final, not necesarily money, maybe something more important, your health, your family....etc....or your soul....you will find out when your body will die. You heard about Howard Hughes, the billionaire, the founder of hell's angels? We can see rejecting God results all over history, all empires fell, comunism fell and now the western societies are falling. 9/11 was evil, about 3000 people got killed, but the doctors are killing 4000 children every day. Who are the biggest terorrists? All terror comes from evil, and the way to fight that is not military, force, more violence and more evil, fighting evil with evil just gives more power to the evil and amplifies it. You will see the results in the future.

Never say never, absoluts doesn't exist in this world Trust me, I know the footprints of the dark side of the force, I'm from Transylvania So you are playing mind games with me?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Your right, but those are exeptions to the rule, you get signs before that hapens, and if you are still taking a loss, it is part of trading, those are rare cases, in the long run the wins are far more than loses

--- 帖子 #348 ---
mental stops are fione just make sure you can execute them fast enough. There are alot of pro traders out there that I know would disagree with the way you count BE's. Because a BE is basicly getting the direction wrong or not exiting when momentum is lost or turns

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Throw away your indicators and look at price action on the rainbow 5 second chart. The original cyrox can't be betttered. Pure price action. The secret is screen time that's all. It's not rocket science.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
. I KNOW 4Xq has a lot of stuffs, so pls allow him to build this system just the way he wants to and the way GOD has directed him to do by helping we the rookies. 4xq, pls don't be discourage right. am about getting it, so pls continue the good work and my GOD has bless u already. Thanks for the good work. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I'm not trying to discourage him at all, I like his system/method What I don't like is his MM but thats diff for everyone. He is more experienced than me I admit that fully, But you can easily spot bad MM, w/e works for you tho every one has different way to get into and out of the market

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Try 1 second though

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I didn't say anything about mental stops, where did u get that? I'm a very slow and calculated person, I can't use mental stops. Like i said, BE doesn't matter for me anyway, I can make money with a 50% wins sys. BE for me is just not making the target or like u say, not exiting at the right moment, because a trader somethimes has to pee , or cook breakfast, have a shower, do laundry, read a book, watch a movieor, even eat somethimes. that's how I trade, doing other things in the mean time, I get very bored very fast if not. Don't do this at home So you didn't onor me with answers...how do you count BE's? and do you play mind games here?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
For me are the times with volatility, usually couple of hours before NY open, after open, after news and until about lunch, when I see the rainbow going thin. If I'm not making my goal of 100 pips/day i may continue after lunch. Somethimes I can get a few trades in the evening too, counting those as for next day because are part of the new trading day that starts at 5PM EST

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Nobody said we improved cyrox. Here are two 1min systems, one is scalping for 10-12 pip and the other is trading for more pips. 5 sec and 1 sec just doesn't fit my personality, it is too fast for me and probably for others too, it is not for everyone, not everybody is young and superman That went trough your brain by chance? I also prefer to trade relaxed and to have a good time I am wondering if somebody can tell me if cyrox traders can make 100 pips minimum in a 4-5 hour session or minimum 500 pips a week trading 4-5 hours a day. I'd realy like to know....pure curiosity...thanx

--- 帖子 #356 ---
you're right, it is very dangerous for people who don't know God...I didn't say I was right, I said HE was right ...big difference

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Thank you, finally somebody agree with me.... a wise thing: if one can trade without SL, it is wise to have one far back and on the broker's sever, just in case of technical failure....ie...no connection, no power, PC blows up.....

--- 帖子 #358 ---
You can trade the rainbow on the 1 minute or 5 minute chart just as you would on the 5 sec. When I trade the M1 I only trade in the direction of the M5. When trading the 5 sec it's in the direction of the 30 sec. A good system works on any timeframe.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
A daily chart is not relevant when you are scalping. Just look for an obvious S/R level on the M1 chart and place the stop a few pips away from it.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
You're welcome...don't worry Nerry, I actualy enjoy a good chalenge, where I come from, healthy arguing is a way of life, that's how we improve things. I miss that here in the west. I'm used to all kinds of attacks, mostly spiritual, because the batlle is ultimately spiritual, the esence of all things The dark forces can take over a person completly or partialy, and in most cases is not the persons fault, and he is totally unaware of that, because he can't make the difference between his thoughts and the flow of thoughts that comes from somewhere else. Did you ever heard people saying...I don't know why I did that....said that....? Back to our sys here, the key of anything is to build on solid fundation...that will last and stand against the blows...solid principles, part spiritual, part specific to the aplication you develop. that's how I do it, may be a better way, but this is how it works for me so far. I repeat...I'm not saying to follow my sys to the letter...I know we are all different and I think one has to adapt a sys to his own personality, style, confort zone....in THE ZONE and then stay there.

Welcome back fxR...I have a few questions 4 u Are you one of those people that sell cyrox or what is your motive to undermine somebody's else work that has nothing to do with your 1sec thing? Why are u doing in this tread if your 1sec is so good? What was the scrat thinking when he saw the mamut? What do you think they did to spies in Transylvania in the 16-th century?

What do you mean by MM, M? A W I w/e ?

MM stands for money managment, w/e stands for whatever. That is about as far as I got on the rough translation.

Thx, I presumed he mean money management, but I coudn't belive he says bad MM

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I have read all the tread for the last days. You system is closely to the one I am looking for as it is fast enough and I can control my gains and loses (hope not too many loses ). I have a few points for you: 1. I totally agree with you about the spiritual issue. Take a look at the "The Moses code" movie. It will give you some insights. Have fun. 2. I am trading your system Wolfenstein v1.2 , on small real account. I think if I trade (small money) then my actions are realistic. I had some loses and gains. I think it would be interesting to analyze the loses so we can learn. Are you trading this system live? 3. Post 227 Wolfenstein v1.2 - what exactly do you mean " Entry: - Price re-emerge" can the price come from the other side or only puilbacks? 4. Post 227 Wolfenstein v1.2 - " at least a yellow dip" Do you enter if the price emerges from other colors? 5. SL - Did you change it down from 20? Keep up the great work. It can only be admired.

If you don't sleep or have no life then ok maybe. but to average 100 pips a day 500 a week is a feat even the best funds would have trouble doing........ some days the market may not move 100 the daily range sure it's rare but they can happen. sorry mate, until i see it i won't believe it. I have seen the rainbow with it's new add on indicator. I like it but i don't use it. If you can make 10-30 with 10+ lots good on u well done. cheers

--- 帖子 #370 ---
fxRichard, if someone can get a 95+ % strike rate consistantly with the gain/loss ratio being even, I would be tempted to risk 5% of my account on each trade, at least until my account got to a very large size. Is this what you mean by your high lot size that goes against standard MM practice?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I read this whole thread and am very impressed with the development. May someone please post the mq4 file for the actual wmma rainbow? Maybe I was looking right over it as I am fairly new to this forum but not trading. Thanks and God Bless.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I don't know anything about cyrox and I was thinking he is one of the makers of that, so he would have the rights to sell it. If you're not plaiyng mind games what was that "psyhology never fails"? If you count BE as a tie, you are not counting a win/lose ratio, a tie doesn't fit in a ratio like that. My trade manager has a seting for BE, again, acording to the principle that you don't have "don't let a winning trade turn into a loss" Actually I should count a BE as a win because it makes the spread....check mate...end of story I will not tolerate your negative comments anymore, wich influents good people here, and if this is bad plicy, you are not welcome here anymore. I will not post any of my trades and tests until you are still lurking around. If God is a created figure this sys will not work for you and God help you.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
It is not a .mq4 file, it is a template .tpl file, at the beginning of tread

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Read the tread mate, and the trades, this sys is aleady proven...made over 500 pips a week and every week and that in developement stage I never claimed I invented the Rainbow, i only modified it

--- 帖子 #375 ---
He means he is risking a very large part of his acct compared to my 2-4%

--- 帖子 #376 ---
4xq, thanks for your contribution here.. just start adding to your ignore list so you can stay focused on your system. I'm a huge rainbow fan as well and I really like some of your insights. Keep posting your results and never let anyone take you off of your topic. I Look forward to enjoying your thread.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I'm not doing anything against forums rules, I'm meerly stating my opinion on your MM. If you look at your BE's alot of them take awhile to retrace and go up fairly high... They are your trades tho not mine. I'm just trying to understand your system. "God" has brought much good and evil to the world so I choose to leave "him/her/it" out of it and focus on better things such as working towards goals like making enough to buy my mom a new vehicle since the one she has been driving is close to 12 yrs old now and has alot of miles on it. I enjoy your method but I don't like the MM thats all that I am saying

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thx, cool motto's

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Thanks ady, I will vach "The Moses code", sounds interesting already 2 I agree with the live acct, I'm only trading this on demo because the next version, Lion King is still in developement...can you post some pics of the trades, so we can analyze? 3 price (thin white line) comes back from pullbacks, but when crosses purple in the dir of 5min trend too + the other conditions 4 entry after a yellow dip, price comes out from colors + the other conditions 5 no, SL20, v1.2 is the last version

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I'm not using the MM yet, fx, looks that u don't understand that this sys is not a finished product yet and I dont use your risk management, so you are right, this sys can't use a big part of the acct on one trade, it is just another sys than yours

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Guys, i think is time out, let's test what we got so far and see how we doing. I've been out of town this week and did only a couple of trades, didn't had time to advance this sys Anybody has a script that would close the trades just in one pair, not all the trades? I don't have the time to make one now. Thanx

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi 4xp, Here are some of the failed trades. Out of 7 trades 3 failed that is 40-60= -20. Making the same mistake is not smart. I want to get to your results. BTW, I replaced the WMA200 with the colored WMA200, so I can see the trend in the 1M. EURUSD - it emerged from the yellow once again and I entered. Then it went all the way back on me. AUDUSD - It looks by the rules.... Thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #383 ---
In this eur situation i woudn't take the trade because the rainbow is too thin, about 10-15 pips...that is a sign of trend reversal, or at least a large pullback and no volatility. Also, the entry is very late, the one i would take if the trend would be strong is after the yellow dip, when the price brakes the support...your green line, and closes there. I don't see any s/r lines from the 5m chart or pivots indy, those help a lot...or maybe your blue line is that? Good idea with the color MA200, but doublecheck if that is the same as the 5m trend

--- 帖子 #384 ---
In this event (yellow dip), i'm using a buy stop at 6-7 pips above the price and i adjust the buy stop if the price continues to go down. So if it's a simple retracement, i take the buy at the right time. If it's a reversal trend, my stop is not reached -normally http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #385 ---
The entry is correct, but the problem is that AUD may need a different SL, or this sys is not working well in this pair. Also after the entry we notice that we have a higher peak on the price, but a lower peak on the cci, so price goes up and cci down, that is sign of reversal. Then cci breaks it's own trend line and the 100 level then I would exit when price went into purple, with a smaller loss. If the time of this trade is just before the close of the trading day, as I can see on the bottom, that is not a good time to take trades with this sys I only tested this on eur, gbp and jpy. I sugest to stick to eur until you get a good grasp of it

--- 帖子 #386 ---
you mean a buy stop order to entry or a stop loss to exit?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
To entry of course. In the area indicated by the yellow arrow, when the price dips in the lower MM, i'm checking the fall. I put then a buy stop at 7 pips above the price and i follow the fall adjusting the buy stop at 7 pips. If it's a retracement and if the price goes up again, i take the buy (stop) at the right time before the re-emergence. If no (reversal down trend), I am protected. In this case, it's a small dip. With a bigger dip, this process is interesting.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi 4xq, just thought I'd share something with you. I love your use of the rainbow as the basis of a trading method...cos it just made me realize that one of greatest gifts to humanity, is colour, and in my flying days I had the privilege of seeing a perfectly circular rainbow at 50,000 ft in a Learjet....what an awesome sight! ..left you a message on your site.... Richard.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Thank you 4xp. The green and blue lines are pivots. So when I was stepped out you would go in. I understand. The MA200 does not correlate always with 5M. I always check the 5M.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I am trading from the opening of London, my 9AM to the end of USA my 23:00. Basically I can trade when ever I like, time wise.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Here are 2 more: Winner swiss- not all by the rules. Before the yellow dip, should have been after. still 10 pips at home. The red line is R1. Loser cad- How can you know that this will be the last before reversal? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #392 ---
sounds very good, if that works 4 u. it is different and earlier that my breakouts entries, earlier probably than the re-emerge...you don't have the drawdowns a break out sys have. I use breakouts as they keep me out of the bad trades at end of trend, but I will try this too...I guess at trend end one may increase the 7 pip so you don't take a trade against the new trend or in a flat or swinging market....or just cancel the order and wait to see what happens...trend change, continuation of trend, or flat....thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Thank you sensei, I didn't even realize that a rainbow can be circular, that is some superb site to see... ones in a lifetime probably

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I meant if the trend would be strong, short before your entry...see pic On the new trend I plotted two entries I would take by so far rules I trade from way before NY open or after and after important news, those that are red on this forum's calendar until before lunch if I see the rainbow go thin...then I may continue after lunch if the rainbow picks up again and I didn't make my pip goal London maybe slows down before they have lunch too, the thing is to find a window with good movement

--- 帖子 #395 ---
In the cad is no trend, is a sideways market...if we look at MA200 is almost flat and on 5m probably see better I try to stay out of no trend and also keep the grid on all 1m charts at 10 pip, it helps to see the big pic, how the rainbow looks like, like that you have a point of reference of dimentions and your eye get's trained to that For me is no trend until for ex. price makes a top (red line), then goes down, then up but doesn't make a new top, then down again and past the dip, the suport (white line), but for this sys on the 5m chart, or just drops down past suport with no significant pullbacks

Thanks a lot. Learning proses is great, feels like growing...

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Probably not my place to step in here, as I am sure 4xq will respond in time, but I did just have to ask.....what the heck is this for?? I took a quick peek at your previous posts, and it seems like you are a requesting machine - EAs, indicators, statements. Two words for you - individual thought. If I am misunderstanding your post, then I apologize. If I am clear on it, then please move on. I read through FF on occasion, find some great threads like this one, and then see the OP disappear because of an onslaught of stupid requests like this. End of rant. Sentinel

Dear 4xq. Rainbow is an expert advisor? We can see on the charts any points from expert. Thank you.

Bad week...last week of the month + August + sick + news and all Fri...8/0...actually did a bad one, but was a mistake, I clicked on a wrong script, so 8/1...107 pips

Thank you, apreciate, works well Q

I don't have an acct dedicated to this, I test different things all the time on the same acct + this is a demo=no statements + Sep 29 didn't hapened yet. Also, I don't need to prove anything to anyone, I'm not selling or promoting anything and this sys is in developement, it is 4 weeks old, so even a montly would be irelevant. I got all kinds of offers from many, but I'm not interested. Go ahead and test it and let me know how you doing. Q

4XP Wolfenstein v1.3 1m chart with the WMMA(2-200) Rainbow and CCI(21) + optional pivots indicator 5m chart with Color MA(34); plot past swing levels (past pivots, then transfer these on 1m) Determine best time to trade (good volatility). Don't trade at open or news time, wait until price stabilizes Determine the major trend (look at 5m to 1H). Best when 5m in same dir as 1H Entry: - Price re-emerge in dir of trend from at least a yellow dip or touch + cci goes over 100(for long)...under -100(for short) + optional break s/r or pivot and closes there //--- Use scripts for speed, with calculated risk and money management (1 mini lot for every $500 in the acct. and SL10; this is a 2% risk) //--- SL may be different for different pairs, check ATR and test, don't take it if price has a pivot just ahead 6. Exit: TP 10-12 pips, SL10 or when price dips at least to yellow and breaks cci trend line against the trade 7. Have Fun

This is a great systems - 5 trades, 1 loss today - 60 pips total. I'm sure other have done better, but I've had other things to do. I'm using the MACD - standard settings - to look for divergences as prelude to a trend change. Many thanks to 4xq for introducing this to us.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
thanks 4xp for sharing this strategy, i love it! and may God bless your ministry bro! i've been demoing this now for 1,5 weeks and i use version 1.3, i have a SL of 12 and a TP of 12 which makes a R:R of 1:1. i have found the best time to trade is when a strong 5 min trend is on the way. So far I have made 30/35 (54% profit). Need to get it up before going live. the problem so far seems that when it crosses the s/r, then it makes a nasty retrace often which hits my SL.

Hello 4 xq, I'm glad to see this thread back to it's 'normal' condition again. Yesterday I was wishing for your continued good health, since not noticing your presence for a while. Actually, I have been enjoying this thread very much. Part of the reason is that I found it soon after it you commenced it here, before it had become hundreds of pages.So it was quite easy to follow along. Also, I thought you seemed to be genuine and well intentioned;and it also seems that some members here were trading successfully. Thanks must go to those who have coded indicators as well. Why these things matter to me. Several reasons really. One is that I am preparing to make a come-back after a financially disasterous experience a few years ago. It has taken quite a while to get the guts, plus a bit of capital to do this. Now that I am semi retired, I have been able to fully immerse myself in the needed preparations for being a trader. It has been a long and interesting experience so far.It is not over yet, and may turn out to be a lifelong journey. However, although the forex market may be a difficult one, IMO it is THE market to master. Regardless of whatever way that gloom and doom media reports, (including the factual ones) figures etc., affect all markets worldwide, there will be abundant opportunities for high probability trades. If you can relate to any of this, you may understand that even an old guy like myself, finds that an atmosphere of friendliness and support, which has been much in evidence here, helps us to keep focused on our purpose. I give my thanks for that.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Wow, while I was typing the above post, I did not see the previous one. 4xq, I didn't realize the extent of the drama. To our usual thread followers. I would be sorry if you give up on us at this stage. A cleansing meditation will help those who know how. Otherwise, just do whatever psychological preparation that you usually do to get in the right frame of mind for trading. I hope we will soon have a positive thread again.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hi Ady, thx, I was back yesterday from hunting and I found chaos here, so I had to clean up the weeds a bit. I was also busy lately with my Time Pivots, I'm in the process of copyrighting, as you see, nobody in history picked tops and bottoms so exactly...it is from God, it is not me...He get's all the credit I also made an EA of the Wolf, a bit different of course, as needs exact rules...it does 600 pips/month on EUR in backtesting so far, will see in forward test With a SL12 and my money management (4% risk on a trade), that is $47,000/month profit, starting with a $10,000 acct Once I'm sure it works, I will probably post it free for people ______________________________________________________________ Hi Dan, I am with you. Keep up the good work. Lets go back to work with the market. Interesting days ahead I see people are making money with the rainbow [/quote]

I think I should end this tread, it is no fun anymore. I gave them check mate, the game is over and to make everybody happy, i will not use the rainbow anymore as the trolls want. I'm just wasting my time fighting worms that will probably not ever turn into buterflies. (no offense, just a metafor) I will cook up another sys, I will start another tread and trade this for a change:

--- 帖子 #430 ---
OK, I modified LionKing and made first trade today, can't remember what version it is next, but I'll look for it, it is somewhere on the tread My principles got removed so i'm posting just the trade...made 50 pips in eur

First of all, thanks to 4xq for sharing his method and i don t know how to thank you. I have been a silent reader for long but now want to stand..... I don t understand why everytime a good thread is on, some are coming, annoy everyone, and finally most of time the person in charge of the thread finally close it. why always these guys come to their goals....????? now i propose to continue the thread and to now answer to negative posting, only looking at post which contribute to the system and strategy..... let s do it.....

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Here's an indicator I whipped together. It shows MA consolidation. The closer to 0, the more likely a breakout will occur.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hola K, I'll tell you why, because i know this very good...like i said before, all reality is rooted in spirituality, all start with a tought This is envy, the evil eye...that's all...simple The moderators advised me same like you, don't answer them and report, they will clean them up I was upset and i was thinking to close, but that's what they want, so I will not get in their trap and continue here Let's trade

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Great day...very fast market afternoon...i messed up a few...the Trade Manager didn't work properly for some reason, so i went manually after a while, lots of slepeage...then modified a script for TP10 Blind Wolf...19/7...146 pips

Oh no! I just discovered this thread and the method seems very intriguing. And now you're telling me that everything I read is worthless without the missing posts?? Please say it isn't so... 4xq, or anybody else who's been following along... Can someone please put together a summary or something for us new to this thread that would include the missing info? Thanks!

What method are you trading now 4Xq? Slade

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hello Dahlia, I finished reading a week or so before the posts were removed and also made then a summary, here you go: Indies: In 5m TF add 34 MA in Color from FF forum Enter: - rainbow must be 10 pips wide - rainbows must be in sequence with eachother - 200 ma must be in same direction as 5m chart - price must have come back from the yellow - +cci over 100 (long) -cci under -100 (short) Exit: - when cci breaks trendline OR - 10-12 pips TP Money Management: - SL 12 pips

Hi Ronald Could you explain how you use this indy with the rainbow system ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Simple. The indi takes the value of all MAs, and calculates the the spacing between each. So when the indicator is near 0 and has an average spacing of 0 pips, it's likely that a breakout will occur. It's just a matter of direction.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Thanks In 1 mn chart, I noticed when the indy is near 0 and 3 bars increasing, it's normally a buy signal and 3 bars decreasing a sell signal. Do you trade like that ?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
No I use it as a tool to detect market consolidation. I still have a rainbow on my chart to help me determine direction.

Hi 4XQ, Seems that your thread above is closed. I fail to comprehend why this is so. Surely even non-believers will understand that the universe holds many many mysteries which most of us cannot yet comprehend fully, unless we attempt to connect with it through the only Pure Spirit, the creator we call God.

So u were legally banned form using the rainbow? So no one is now allowed to use more then 10 MA's on a chart? if that is so Linuxtroll go suck a Di.ck how can u own MA's? ( If not then please don't do that troll man) why don't you go and start your own form on the method and change the rainbow just enough so it's not in copyright. Like I said no one can own the rights to MA's that is rubbish.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
No, it is nothing like that, there is no copyright, I just wanted to prove that I don't need the rainbow, I didn't even used it here the way cyrox do, they told me that...I may use it again if I get bored of the one white line

Hi, I just followed this thread after a quick brush about cyrox rainbow. I actually did live trade using your 1min &amp; 5 min chart based on ur first posts, and just recently, found out about your wolfstein version. Why in the world do u think ur wasting your time? if it's actual reinforcement or support ur looking for, here I am, a living proof of someone whose energy is vibrating and radiated from frequency that u generated. Hope it's not too late.. BTW, what does ur avatar represents?

First of all, thanks to 4xq for all you have done to make this thread what it is. I have looked at these sys/methods as well as the cyrox method and although i still dont know too many specifics about cyrox all i have to say is..."to each his own." Which is why I didnt really get the drama near the end of this thread I was first intrigued by the bow in Pip Ventures' "chronicles of a PA scalper" but in not trying to move too fast(&lt;1min) i have slowly moved from PA on the daily to the 1H and so on down to the min. So far my demoing the bow with your rules and have had better than good results(although difficult, i especially like the trend lines on the CCI for possible exits). Anyway, it being about a year since this thread has seen any "real" activity I was just wondering what has happened to this sys/method? Anyone still practicing this method? Is 4xq still around or has he been bannished for unorthadox views? I have been L3rkin' this forum for a while not posting but learning more than i did interning at FXSol and would like to thank 4xq for this thread, as well as the many others who have contributed selflessly. Thanks, Magellan

just read the whole thread in 2days glued to it...1st.. more blessings to 4xq , i cant say how thankful enough i am for teaching me and others here so much. i felt like i was watching a movie , i read with so much emotion as it all unfolded...the good guy doing good and the bad roll up to disrupt the harmony and almost living him for dead but was kept alive and lifted by good angels here..etc Thank u 4xq ,im a newbie still on a demo and all my gratitude to you ! To those who removd 4xq's educational threads and yet this is what this forum is intended for in the 1st place ,I wonder why u even started this forum and SHAME ON YOU , YOU LOST THE WHOLE POINT/OBJECTIVE OF HAVING A FORUM ! 4xq , i hope u will live to fight another day here because you do have a great following and rainbow "disciples" here. God bless all

I have encountered few people that i call "teachers" in my life. These people are those that try to give others of theyre wisdom, and they enjoy it. I try to be one of these people in my life, and i see that you do to. I would like you to know, that somebody you never met feels this. Now i dont think that anybodies words and wisdom should be adhered to because of leadership or authority, these concepts are void (the words exists only as sound/symbol but has no meaning) to me. Other peoples words and wisdom should be able to stand on its own so to speak, by experiences or arguments concerning mutual experience, and yours does. Therefore: Thank you 4xq.

Where can I download the rainbow indicator?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Please HELP!!. I want to try to this scalping Rainbow strategy on the FXDD demo but I don't know how to set it up. Is it nothing but weighted moving averages?... have 0-10 periods in purple, 11-19 in green, 20-39 in another color? Or is it something that you could just click an add on like bollinger bands, and all you have to do is adjust the settings?... because if that's the case I can't find it, I don't see "WMMA" anywhere. Please someone tell me how to put this indicator on my chart. Sorry for this, I'm new to forex. Thanks for any help.

Find MAs that works for you. I cant tell you what works for you, you have to find out for yourself, may the force be with you You can try to contain price with MAs, so that you try finding out what MAs inhibit the changes of price. Check out the Guppy thread and the text files posted there my Matsu, thats a start. Also look at what Linuxtroll is doing. A lot of the stuff in this thread was removed and i never found out why. 4qx isnt around any more it would seem. Just load the template 4qx made in the first post if you want to try that out. The rainbow, guppy averages and stuff like that arent unique indicators, they are stock indicators, at least in MT4, so its just the template that 4qx used that is unique. But its probably better if you try to make your own, but take influence from other people. And dont try to rush it, you wont do it in a week, and not in a month. Eventually, and statistically speaking you will probably move on to something else. And then when you have moved on to something else you will move on to a third alternative, statistically i mean, i cant give you the answer for you as a human being since i dont know you. So you really need to know you will probably fail, and you can only succeed if you understand that and what it means. There is no guarantees, thats the only guarantee i can give you. Anyway, i would like it if things work out for you, but dont try to rush anything, you wont get anything done that way. But you need to work really hard and dont listen to what people say to much, including me, you need to use your own mind. And then the force might be with you. I find the story of this thread very peculiar, im not surprised, but it is peculiar still. Oh one more thing, it seems people in this thread often missed one crucial point again and again, the MAs need to separate some so that the colors is easily distinguishable and there is a clear slope of the MAs. That is a definition of "trend", and "trend" is needed to trade this way. Im not saying it should or is the only way one should trade, there is a way to trade everything that happens to price with an accuracy of about 3-4 pips. Its only a matter of concentration to figure out how to do it.

I ran across this thread on Rainbow Scalping yesterday and today was the first day I traded it. I had 6 wins in 6 trades with a total of about 80 pips on the GBPUSD, EURUSD. I've traded all kinds of trade plans both commercial and free, and I was very impressed with the results of this method. I did add pivots, the 233 ma on 30m chart and the Coral (from the THV) to give me ideas on S/R levels. As well I consulted higher time frames charts to get a sense of the long term trend. I look forward to testing this further and appreciate 4xQ for posting this thread. If 4xQ happens to visit this thread, I'm curious to know if the time pivots indicator was ever posted or explained here or elsewhere in FF. God Bless)

hi .. yeah i got an idea i have used ur system with TMA+CG indicator ... (which is more like bollinger bands) and i saw improvements now i got win percentage of 95 further now i can put stop loss at 15 rather than 20 which eat up most of the profits. you can download tma indicator and get into a trade wen the 200 ma and lower or upper bang comes togther this increase the odds on your side and gives confidence on a tighter stop loss. thnx sidh

Allo ? This strategy is finish ?? Nobody use it ??

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Damn it! I must, the template that you create looks so cool. Love it so much! Than you, thank you again! You just give me a huge fortune!!! This will be my "Hit and run" comment, because I know that, this is somehow screw up your initial strategy and not so many like long term trading. However, just wanna contribute to you guys another way of thinking if you find it interest! Open the chart, 4H or Daily chart, load the template from 1st post, look at that chart and you will see the miracle. It does not happen only for one pair, it happens for all major pairs I must say (I trade 10 pairs). Trading many times does not make sure that you will win more than the one who have high quality decision. Nice pip for everyone!

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Is there a successful EA that can trade this system? That will be great. Warm Regards.

If there was such a thing, confirmed true and true, the code would be worth billions. Study trading some more and you may come to understand this and why it is so. Have a nice day!

Hi Tantra, I have spent the last day reading through this whole thread and really impressed with the rainbow system but also really sorry to see the creator of it has quit.... but glad to see some recent posts and that this thread is still alive. Also glad to see you are making some pips... Do you have an mq4 file for the CCI indi you are showing on your charts? If so please can you attach it here? Also any pointers on your entry and exit signals will be greatly appreciated. Cheers, Gavin

Hi Sentinel, There so much wisdom, knowledge and inspiration in this thread - that to 4xQ (Dan) for his sharing! A week ago a little voice said to me to investigate Rainbow trading (I was ready to ditch trading for good), and after searching and finding this thread my interest in trading was instantly revived – and thanks to God, and of course to Dan for that! Sentinel, I see that you are marked as a 'buddy' in 4xQ's profile and I was wondering if you are still in contact with him, and if he is still active and contactable - even if it is outside of the forums? If you get this message, please let me know. Kind regards, Gavin le Roux

Of course I can share! Right from this wonderful forum I downloaded! Overall I decided to try this system. Does not differ from any other published herein. Described are rules to be followed and this is of course only 1-3 weeks did enough to gain an idea of ​​a strategy. but I like to try something different to show me new techniques and results that can improve my thinking for better input and better profit. I went back to the old idea of ​​GUppy MA, which does not differ much from this strategy even complement each other. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=267184

I have noticed that most in this forum talking about something they expect to happen in the future but can not talk about what is happening now. Past is easy to tell , the future is easy to predict what we want, what happens now when the price now moves -only market makers know somewhere. Those who know they are silent when the price talk and follow it are found here frequently.

is this thread dead? has anybody tried using it on indices (DIJA, DAX) - does wonders sometimes... has anybody tried to implement Wolf (with CCI and Lag) as a proper ea? I've tried with a mixed success: ~66% success rate avg 3-4 trades/day no trailing stop a lot of them seem to be picked up a bit too late :/ thank you

--- 帖子 #524 ---
The delays re due to the moving averages. The moving averages have a lag, thus they are not as fast as the prices move. But generally it is a good system.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
That's the drawback, I mainly trade price action (15mins-1h tf) but sometimes like a thrill of loosing money on 1-5min (joking) and this simple strategy even with 1 trade per 1-2 days for 3-5 pips as a EA sounds good. Is this thread dead?

Nice to see the rainbow back in action as I have been trading it along side another system for years.. ..

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hello Cigarguy! I tried Rainbow some other way, but I'm strongly interested in your variation. I folowed your trades in history at the topic abot THV and have several questions: 1. What do you call MM momentum? 2. Why do you enter trades (at THV topic examples) later then Rainbow and TMS Matrix propose? Thank you for your time and attention!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
What's the strength indi that the yellow arrow points to? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I look at a couple of different charts. The rainbow as posted here for the main trend along side of the PVSRA chart I post on that thread to confirm my entries. As for MM momentum, as you are probably aware, there is more activity on different pairs at different times of the trading day. When the charts become active ie., after a news event or just prior too or after a Session open or close as an example. The higher t/f's do not offer as much as a clear indication as the actual momentum so I will drop down to a M1 or M5 chart and then enter based on the trend and PA relative to the key levels on maybe the M5 or M15. I wish I could offer you more insight that you are looking for but I have been trading for a few years and have many hours of screen time and just get a feel for a couple of currencies that I watch and how they move. I only watch EU and UJ which trade conversely and I suggest to any new trader not to get anxious about missing a trade on many currencies and focus on just a couple of their choice. Just my style and each trader must find what works for them.. .... Stay GREEN My Friend!

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I just use that to give me a heads up on the currencies strength, not for entries and then take a look at those charts as prospects for trade entries based on PA relative to key levels of S/R and the current momentum. Here it is you can give it a try and see if it is beneficial.......

--- 帖子 #539 ---
EU M5 +104 (20 lots +5.2) entered long after pullback below key level 1.06000 and PA ran above this level with MM momentum... ... I thought I was done for the day with +170 but could not pass on this trade totaling +274 and now I'm done I think!!..... ... Stay GREEN My Friends! Attached Image

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Per PM's I have been asked what other charts I look at to determine the short term trend for FIFO scalping and PA relative to key levels as S &amp; R for entries. I watch this M5 chart with real candles ( not HA's ) super imposed over one hour candles in the background. I also watch for the beginning of the new one hour candle which many times will offer a nice scalp trade at the beginning of this candle. I sometimes use the installed EA set for a quick 5 pip profit and a hidden emergency stop loss in case of a power outage. The hour timer at the top of my work space alerts me at the beginning of the hour to prospect for a trade with the new hour candle forming also considering PA and support/resistance. Hope this helps!......

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Thank you for the last 2 answers!

--- 帖子 #542 ---
No Problem and the best of luck and many GREEN pips for you. ..

--- 帖子 #543 ---
This is what you are mainly looking for in trading the rainbow is this MMA twist as pictured in agreement with the matrix. There are many other possible entries when watching with a candle stick or HA chart as well in conjunction with the rainbow but this PA movement will many times present excellent entry opportunities. Trading the rainbow successfully is a VISUAL ART that can only be leaned from lots of screen time. As of the posting of this chart no trades are presented with UJ as it is consolidating/ranging just above the daily open line near the 123.250 key level and trades will probably present themselves later in the evening with the LO and the news........... . UPDATE: Bottom chart rainbow depicting move up after ranging as pictured above. Not exact time frame but just a example for visual purposes of what that move looked like.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
U M5 FIFO scalp +26 (reduced my lots from 20 to 5 due to low volatility at this time and low confidence trade +5.2) entered short with USD strength on pullback and M5 long candle wick figured good for a few pips and closed at my usual 5 +/- pips........ ... In answer to some PM's; Yes I trade another system as well on a different thread as I find they both serve as good confirmations for entries.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
EU M15 example of a good short for position traders depicting the rainbow twist as I mentioned in a prior post. Although this is a M15 chart if another chart such as the M1 or the M5 is viewed in conjunction with this M15 the trader can see this move occurring as obviously all moves begin at lower time frames. Just an FYI for new traders watching rainbows......... ..

--- 帖子 #546 ---
EU, Wow +222 (20 lots +11.1) late entry butjust caught a small piece of this move in 3 seconds after pullback and break of 1.07000 key level after EURO reached a 7 year low. Hope some banked nice pips...... ...... No talent needed here, just pull the trigger, grab the momentum and go for the ride

I really like the idea, but "liking it" isn't enough. However, I still keep my "rainbow" chart - it helps me determine the overall trend (and I also kept it in my avatar ). It has serious limitations (at least for me) and I became profitable only when I started combining the rainbow with daily pivots, S/R and fibo.

I am trying to test this system, and partially understand it. Besides rainbow on M1, I also use CCI and LG to identify entry/exit. I have problem to read rainbow. Ok, let me explain how I understand it and read it: - let's say it is uptrend (CCI above 0 and LG cross 0.15 upwards) and red color starts to raise above yellow - let's say theoretically I will place buy order and price continues goes up...profit taken at some level. What I do not understand with rainbow (dont know how to interpret different colors) when situation is opposite: - let's say from above example, at some point there is a reversal in trend, price starts fall down (CCI drops, LG croos 0.85 downwards) and thin line starts to reverse (but red MAs still out of yellow). And let's say downtrend is on sight, so when should I enter short entry considering rainbow? Should I wait red to touch yellow MAs, cross them, go further to greens MAs, or? In case I wait for that long, other indicators like CCI and LG will start showing reversal (uptrend), so it could be too late to enter short. Also, how to interpret red MAs when they are inside rainbow? I mean, there are also some "trends" going on while red MAs inside rainbow, but do not know how to read it, what it means when red MAs are crossing purple, blue, and so on...? Some additional explanations on how to read rainbow would be beneficial. Thanks.

@Ninja...I can see you use big lot sizes, what is your risk/reward ration (how big your stop loss is)? For me it is interesting to see such trade model (small pips with big lots), you must have heavy confidence on such trades and congrats on that. I also plan to go similar way, but will stay at 2-3lots max too keep liqudity.

Hi, I see that you joined back in 2008 and you have had a busy past 6 months just trying out a lot of different trading systems, I have been in your shoes and have done the same in the past. It is a matter of finding what fits/suits you best. Just like cigarguy's reply to you, there is an element to trading that can't be explained but comes with many years of trading experience. You need to learn to read Price Action. Next come the intangibles , first you have got to develop a so called third eye (intuition). Second is discretion meaning to know when to take or disregard a trade signal. Last is active trade management skills which is key to this kind of low time frame trading (M5). There is more to my trades than just when below the rainbow you sell and when above you buy. My criteria are as following but this is only 70% of trading my trading process the rest was mentioned above. 1.) Look at currency strength meter and try to trade the weakest against the strongest currency if the spread isn't too high. It is best when EUR is at the bottom and JPY at the top or vice versa. 2.) You have got to know the average session range for the traded pair and its tendencies (personality). 3.) Price needs to be below the the rainbow and all the rainbow colors need to be in the exact following order meaning for a buy the order must be white, purple, blue,green,yellow and red meaning they need to be stacked on top of one another this way and vice versa for a sell. 4.) H1 and H4 need to be both red for a sell and green for a buy. 5.) The multimeter indicator on the very top right needs to be almost all red for a sell at least from M1-H4 and green for a buy. The more the same color the better. 6.) On the bottom window the TMS-Matrix 4TF indicator at least top three rows need to be red for a sell and blue for a buy. 7.) Price needs to in the process of making a hook (U-turn) and coming out of the rainbow. 8.) Read Price Action, no traffic ahead (Support or resistance, Round number) and price is making a lower high, lower low for a sell and a lower high, higher low for a buy. I also have a plain M5 chart open at the same time to see these thing easier. 9.) No immediate upcoming News. 10.) Fundamental knowledge and understanding of what is happening currently in the market. There are a few more concepts such as when the rainbow rolls over but they are a little lower probability setups. Not So Simple After All. You follow all the above steps and you are going to be near breakeven. The other 30% trading decision process is what takes you to the next level (profit). I studied all of cigarguy's trades in this thread and the other 2 threads and then spent a lot of time and found all his indicators on my own. The indicators you asked for are the following: The H1 and H4 indicator is called UFX Trend multiMeter. The round number indicator is called SweetSpotsGold...... Both of these indicators have been posted on many occasions in one of the threads that you have visited in the past in the commercial section I also trade a few other methods as well, once you acquire that intangible 30% part of trading plus Price Action reading skills then you can trade any robust trading system and TF with ease. Some of my posted trades don't follow all the criteria points to the T but experience allows me too bend a few of them because Price Action is first and then indicators

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Nice criteria! I'm also a fan of using the H4 and H1 Candle to determine the preferred direction for entries, plus I use the Daily Candle but with some currencies and in some markets the Daily Candle can change color as well. Have you used ATR projections or Pivots at all? How about the Center of Gravity indicator?

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Very good question Mares. The answer falls in that 30% part . Just like cigarguy, I employ an emergency hard SL which varies depending on the traded pair and I close a trade before it reaches it. My TP is dynamic meaning that I actively mange my trades and move my SL to BE after I am in profit by X many pips depending on the traded pair. A fixed 10 pips SL and TP won't work here. As cigarguy has expertly explained we are looking to go with the momentum, fast in fast out. Please keep in mind that aiming for short distances with big/heavy lots is very risky and requires a lot of experience and flexibility and it is not advised for those who are new to trading.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I employ a form of pivots and ADR in trading a HTF strategy. I have looked at Center of Gravity indicator briefly but don't use it.

Hi Ninja, thanks for reply. Could you tell me what is your average time per trade (how long it takes when you enter position and close it)? I am trying to be in shortest possible, and my positions last usually between 2-5minutes, sometimes goes up to 15mins. All trades that goes beyond 15-20minutes I consider as fails even they end up with profit (because they did not end up at t/p level within my personal projected timeframe) .

--- 帖子 #568 ---
You are welcome Mares, I agree with you to a certain extent regrading time spent in a trade, I don't sit and wait forever until I get to a predefined profit target since my TP is dynamic anyway. When trading big lots and going for short distances (small pips) I constantly monitor and manage my ongoing trade(s) . As far as considering a trade closed for a profit a fail because it took to long, that is too strict for me. Profit is profit in this business. As of now, I prefer to trade this method during less volatile times and I start looking for trades about 2 hours before LO since the moves are a little slower and as a result I am a little more patient with my trades. I started late today. The indicators on my chart are there for a reason , they help me see the market sentiment change and I may close a trade for a few pips in the +/- based on them but I am also fully aware that an unexpected large move will take out my emergency SL.

Hi Ninja! Trying to analise your trades I'd like to ask: what's your brokers timezone? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #572 ---
It is GMT+2. Please keep in mind that over 80% of the trades that I have posted here, some of the indicators looked different at entry time compared to exit time, so you can't really analyse the indicators at the exit to see what they looked like at the entry time! EURAUD short trade, +48.0 pips ( 8 lots at +6.0 pips) . For example, here at entry time EUR was in the second position from the top on the left currency strength meter and at the trade conclusion, it is in the third position form the top.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
EURNZD short trade, +67.2 pips ( 8 lots at +8.4 pips) . At the time of entry the top right meter was all red.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Very much appreciated to read about all those systems, I'm going through the "Trending" PDFs to grasp the ideas and the difference with the rainbow in this thread. Gonna read the whole thread before asking stupid questions, currently trying with some indices (US30) in a demo account. [EDIT] Tried to couple it Genesis for the M5 analysis, M1 is rainbow. I made a lighter rainbow with dashed lines instead of full lines. Template attached below if you want to try. I looked for "red" compressing against the yellow layers. The red stripe did not go deep into the inner layers due to a high bullish momentum. Quite promising on the performance side. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #575 ---
May I ask what are the exact rules for entry and exit? Should we wait for all lines to begin to change direction? Isn't that too late?

Market is having some rest, meanwhile I'm working on my indicators by looking at the start of this thread where Laguerre and CCI were mentionned. Wanted to make the crossing around 0 (CCI) and at 0.85/0.15 levels more clearer (Laguerre). I attached the updated .ex4 just in case it's useful to someone. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Pipsninja, Great to see that you have become extremely proficient trading the Rainbow. It appears, that all of your research and dedication is paying off. I could have easily uploaded the rainbow and the indicators that I show on my charts, ( which is what many traders want as to be hand feed) but by not doing so, your dedication and drive to learn this system became apparent and motivated you to undertake a journey to find them yourself, and make the chart your own, driven by your passion to succeed........ What I ideally will look at is the trend on higher t/f's and then drop down to M1 or M5 and look for a retrace and when PA at that lower t/f retraces and moves back into and joins the main trend then look for an entry ( but must be careful that this retrace is not, in fact, a change in trend) Prior to entry all considerations must be given to PA location relative to key levels as S &amp; R, volume and up coming news events, trading session etc., and the chosen currency momentum is sufficient to propel you into nice profits.( this momentum is critical for quick pip scalps) I personally trade a couple of systems that play nice together as this is one. Trading is not a "one size fits all" business and one must think outside of the box.. Regards and Stay GREEN My Friend!

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Thank you for the compliment, your trading has been inspirational . I am in the process of replacing the TMS Matrix with the Sonic Volume indicator and the rainbow with the dragon . If you decide to start your own thread, I would be happy to contribute. Happy GREEN Pipping My Friend in 2016 and Beyond .

Today I want to share my experience using rainbow. I have read four times this 30 pages with this system trying to understand how to make it right. I opened a demo account with 500usd and blew up in less than 9 trades jejeje. last sunday I opened a real account with 90usd, I made my first trade and win 23usd and at the same time lost 23usd... what happend since sunday was awesome for me. 37 trades with profit, 1 trade with lost, 90 usd become to 497usd in 4 days, winning more than 100usd each day. each trade open with 0.3 lots is my rule, no more never until reach 500usd, trade only in EU Market Open, and trade always after the news never before. But today,,, today i have broken my rules, I made the worst stupid thing, I broke all the rules and i have paid... Usd/japan news!, lots 1.00 lot!, no eu market open! and lost 300 usd in one minute. I feel so angry with myself, but I learnt my lesson, today i will take my money and no trade , when i leart to control my emotions. I checked this system by myself, and it really works , just keep in mind the rules always, and slap yourself when you think break them. Thank You all. Thank you, Thank you... I will be here reading each new post, and I hope to calibrate my strategy soon to share with you. Next month I will open and account with 100usd and start again and to share with you my errors and profits... Thank you my friends, and sorry for my bad english.

Great work Cenit! How's this week treating you?

--- 帖子 #590 ---
I cant complain this week, I i have bitten a little the market :-), but at this moment i do not feel safe trading with rainbow in eur/usd, i can not win easy. I dont like where the market is right now, its very confusing, besides I need to improve the strategy, I will not trade until next week, eur/usd is confusing for me, and dangerous with rainbow right now. over leverage. (money managment) Bad strategy to exit when market is against me. This two things I need to improve. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Master. I saw like 4 or 5 strategies for rainbow on this thread, but I worried when I read this what pips ninja wrote, because pips ninja have all the reason. And he wrote at the end:Not So Simple After All... Practice, experience, follow rules, criteria, cold head, and a little of lucky. Good trading for all you. Well, I will read this thread just one time again. I need to make some notes. Please pips ninja share your template, I would like to practice with it. Thank you. And sorry for my english, I am learning yet.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Please don't be offended as you both may have many years of trading experience and I am just talking in general terms. I understand that seeing a few traders making 50.0-130.0 pips in a single trade on M5 using big lots seems like an easy way of making quick money with very little effort but jumping straight into M5 trading without having any prior success in trading the higher time frames is a very difficult way of making money in trading. We always think that the most recent version of a trading method is the best one which in most cases isn't true. Trading this system as in post #1 and Post #2 can make you money. I highly recommend that you only read 4xq (thread starter) posts/charts and only trade the way he did and forget all the other/latest versions. The original method is a very good one. In my humble opinion, trading is like piecing together a very complicated jigsaw puzzle, no need to make our task any harder by adding more pieces. I no longer trade the this method not due to it not being profitable but as traders we have got to always try to simplify our trading method and not over-complicate it. I wish you both great fortunes on your trading journey

--- 帖子 #593 ---
hi Cenit ,great jobs from you , and do you still using this strategy anymore ?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hello everyone, since I am a junior member and thus I am not allowed to create a new thread, so please may somebody of you help me achieve my target. I am trading a system that contains several indicators and I enter manually, but I have to exit according to one of the indicators called (smFisher Transform3-impr) what i need is an expert that will exit when this indicator crosses the zero line level and turns from one color to another. of course the expert must be able to close the profitable trades on the chart it is attached to and this may be obvious but I am not a programmer and have to be sure only. I attached the indicator (ex4+mq4) with an image witch will clarify what I have been through. I hope you care!!!

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Has anyone been trading this system for a reasonable length of time? If so could you post some stats: % Wins Average pip gain Average pip loss number of trades per day/week/total average trade length pairs traded Best session to trade etc. Much appreciated

Hi all, I have made a lua version of this script for those interested to experiment in FXCM Trading Station. Change the extension of the script to ".lua" then drag&amp;drop it over a graph in TS2. It uses WMAs for the moving averages as in the original script. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi All. I found this thread as I originally was looking into the Guppy's MMA as I always struggled to see the right direction of the market (I was overcomplicating it). Actually the whole thing started with 3SMA strategy. Anyway that aside. I looked into the rainbow and I came across this thread. I think that 4XQ did a really good job with the system. I started trading this method couple of weeks ago (only traded few days including today) after getting a hang of it and the results are rather good. I will post my account activity in this thread. I only made a slight change and the change was to add 20EMA, 100EMA and 200EMA to the higher time frame as I can see the market more clearly, especially the short term trading activity. I was thinkging about resurecting this thread with hope of getting the attention of 4XQ (purely out of the curiosity if he is still trading this method after so many years) . I kept the rules as per the last Wolf v1.3 but like I said the only change was the higher time frame EMAs, everything else stays the same. Please see the stats and if anyone is still interested in trading this method and would like to share this experience I might start a new thread, but let's see first if there is anyone out there still trading the same method. P.s Like I mentioned above I only traded live this method for few days (I went on holidays and now I'm back), but I think it shows the potential. Hopefully we can get this thread started again.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
As promised, I am sending another screenshot of the actual trades I took using this system. Only 2 trades today as I am working at the same time so I don't have that much time to spend in front of the screen. Is anyone familiar with the thread to pinpoint the best exit strategy? What do you guys use regarding exits for this system? I am not using the indicators for exit I am consulting higher time frame candle patters to try pinpoint the top, maybe I am missing something? 4XQ where are you buddy

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Also, I will start trading 5 min rainbow and 30 min as trend chart for this system. I want to get more pips out of the market.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I don't know if anybody is going to be reading it, but I will be posting my results anyway

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Ok. I think I'm done for the day. I made one more trade on EUR/USD not a long ago, closed majority of the trade and moved the rest to BE and got stopped out with a little loss (actually it is the trade commission that took the trade into the red). but so far so good 7 trades in total and 1 light loss. That's 85% success ratio.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
hi. at first I would like to say I am seeing your results and they are great. could you please share how you enter a trade with this system .thanks

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hi Mortezakh, I follow the rules set out in the post 408, I believe that's the latest version of the Wolf for scalping. I never got to trade the LionKing version of it as i'm not a huge fan of CCI trendlines (I make too many mistakes on them). I only have a slightly different setup for the higher time frame. Please see the screenshot below. For the higher TF I use 20, 100 and 200EMA to see the current trend on the 5 minute, but I also look at the 30min trend just to confirm that there is nothing developing in there that can stop my trade from working out. You will be able to see the exact entries I did i.e. today when you look at the time from the account overview (all times are UK). Below is the screenshot of my chart setup. Post 408 4XP Wolfenstein v1.3 1m chart with the WMMA(2-200) Rainbow and CCI(21) + optional pivots indicator 5m chart with Color MA(34); plot past swing levels (past pivots, then transfer these on 1m) Determine best time to trade (good volatility). Don't trade at open or news time, wait until price stabilizes Determine the major trend (look at 5m to 1H). Best when 5m in same dir as 1H Entry: - Price re-emerge in dir of trend from at least a yellow dip or touch + cci goes over 100(for long)...under -100(for short) + optional break s/r or pivot and closes there //--- Use scripts for speed, with calculated risk and money management (1 mini lot for every $500 in the acct. and SL10; this is a 2% risk) //--- SL may be different for different pairs, check ATR and test, don't take it if price has a pivot just ahead 6. Exit: TP 10-12 pips, SL10 or when price dips at least to yellow and breaks cci trend line against the trade

--- 帖子 #605 ---
the CCI entry over 100 or below 100 do work best in strong trending markets all EMAs pointing at 4 o'clock or 2 o'clock. When the market is in the established downtred but is not dropping hard the Laguerre entry works pretty good, short when it crosses 0.85 and long when it crosses the 0.15 up. The rainbow has to be in the right order.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I have to be honest the only thing I struggle with a little is when is the best time to exit, I'm not as good as letting the trade run. I have to work on that. Hopefully it will come with time and practice.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Also I forgot to mention that I use pivot points and S/R on the 5 minute charts as points of reference.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
perfec t.i will follow you in this thread and try to test and I am going to share the results with you.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Great. It will be nice if you could share your experience like you said. Hopefully through all that we can make it even better. New day tomorrow and I will post all my trades together with the analysis.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I will try to learn how you trade if you share them .and then I will share until we find the best way for it lets do it

--- 帖子 #611 ---
HI Mortezakh, I just made a trade on EURGBP (top of the account statement). Please see the below my entry point from this morning. I looked at the 5 minute EMA together with the 30 minute EMAs. They all pointed down also there was still some room for the price to reach S1 Pivot Point. I entered a little prematurely on the 1 minute chart as I saw the price getting close to -100 CCI, but the price broke the trendline so I thought I'm good to go. The price action went back on me a little but there was a strong resistance on the M1 horizontal green line so I held it to see if it's going to respect it and it did. I couldn't enter the 2nd trade when price came out of the red (that was where the big drop was) as I already used my margin.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
hi David .and good morning.thanks for sharring.i also had 2 positions on eurusd and I will share.just a question, do you set SL for all your trades? and sorry for my bad English(I have been learning English for a year)

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I got 2 buy positions on eur usd .the lines in my picture are kind of S/R that I use.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hi. I set SL for all my trades it ranges from 15 to 20 pips. I know its not 2 to 1 and sometimes it's not even 1 to 1 ratio, that's why I need to learn to hold the trades for longer. On your entries its much better to wait until the price dips into the yellow Moving Averages combined with CCI or Laguerre. Do you use those indicators? Don't worry about your English, its not my mother tongue either.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
it's good that you set SL .because without it the statement is worthless .however if we try to find a good way even with 1/1 rate and 70 or 80 % win rate it will be great especially in long term.i don't use cci or languerre or any other indicators ,because i like trading with simple chart and too many indicators have a negative effect on my trades. instead i use my knowledge of price action.i would like to focus on Eurusd for the begging.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I totally agree, I always use the SL more often I put the SL right above the last peak or valley on the 5 minute chart. It's good that you use naked chart, the indis comfort me in some sort of a weird way. I'm back at my desk right now and I will see if I can get more trades in now.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hi mate, just a quick one. Since we are here to learn from each other, how do you choose your entries? do you go off the simple pullback (2nd Entry) I can't figure out the first entry you did? Was it of the broken resistance? Thanks

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I am now looking at to enter the EURCAD, still got some time before the CAD rate decision. on the 30 min chart price is trading above the 200EMA and the 5 min EMAS are nicely lined up also there is a little pullback on the 5 minute. I will see what happens when the price will get closer to the m1 resistance.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
at first i wait till the price comes to my lines if the price goes up to the lines and m5 chart is ok and in m1 chart i see the signal with the first pullback i will take a buy.and if the price goes below the lines and m5 chart is ok and in m1 chart i see the signal with the first pullback i will take a sell. i also check the price that doesn't be distant of my lines.it is just an idea and i have taken 2 trades and it's too early to decide that it will work or not.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
do you enter the first pullback on the m1 after the rainbow is lined up together with the m5 chart?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
no i don't .i just check the price on m5 that is up or below moving average .for entering i just use rainbow in m1

--- 帖子 #622 ---
What moving average you use on the m5 if I may ask?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
actually i use moving average that you mentioned before .20 100 200

--- 帖子 #624 ---
oh ok, cool. I just got stopped out on my EURCAD trade.... got to make it back now will post the final results at the end of today.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
the third position that I took was a buy and it went for SL.i set TP 7 and SL 6 ,if I set SL to 10 it would not be negative .however I set tp and SL 1/1 rate. let's see what will happen

--- 帖子 #626 ---
We will see. I went into the negative today. I will post the pictures of my setups i took and maybe we can work out what happened it took my gains from the week into minus. I will make it back.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
HI All, sorry I have been busy las couple of days. I had a couple of bad trades on Wednesday and it took me balance for the week into the negative, however I changed couple of things yesterday and made 2 good trades fo the total of 18.6 pips. Actually there was couple of changes, first one I changed the EMAs to 20 50 and 100 EMA (I used to use 20 100 and 200), I feel like the 20 and 50 ema give me a better trend view of the pairs. the 2nd change was more on the psychological side of things. I was a lot more patient and waited for the trade to form. I now wait for the 5 minute to finish it's pullback usually to the space between the 20 and 50 ema (area of value) and when I can see that the pullback might be ending I go to the m1 to see if the rainbow and all the conditions are met for the trend to continue on the lower time frame i.e break of the last low, break of the TL or S/R. Also, when I use this type of entry I can hold the trade a lot longer on the m1 as I know that the 5 minute will either retest the last low or it'll go past it. If I think it will I maximise on the trade, in other words I close the first half of the position move the SL to BE and then I let the other half go to the next point of reference, it might be a pivot point or another major S/R. Mortezakh, how are you doing? Thanks

--- 帖子 #628 ---
yesterday I had 2 trades on eurusd one of them hit the TP and the other hit SL.in m1 there are some noise signal and I think we should decrease them.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hi Mortezakh, over this weekend I was backtesting it a lot and I noticed that CCI -100 or +100 when entering the trade would keep you out of the false signals and whipsaws a lot. I also started using the 20, 50 and 100 EMA as it gives a better view of the current trend. 20 100 200 EMA were given an outlook for a larger timeframes and now I see it better (maybe it's only me) the trend on the 5 minute. Also, i am changing my stop loss to 10 pips now, 20 pip on the m1 time frame is just too much I can see if the price is going to go up more than 10/12 pips on the m1 it is usually a deeper pullback on the 5 minute or even a trend chane on the larger time frame. Anyway, I did that in the last few trades and it worked out pretty well. It's a shame that I lost those 2 big trades, I ended up positive for the week, I will be updating the forum next week. Below is what I finished on last week. If it wasn't for the 2 big losses it would be a nice trading week. 13 trades in total. 10 Winners and 3 Losers. Ratio is 77%. Pretty good I guess.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Also, just to add to the previous message. I look on 2 Higher time frames. I start with the 30 minute timeframe to check the EMA, then I switch to 5 minute to see if they are also lined up and then I make a trading decision on the m1. checking the 30 minute charts allow me to filter out the best pairs to trade. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
please post this week result, this is the most waiting thread for me in ff

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Hi FXmir, I will post my results either later on today or tomorrow. I was experimenting with few changes this week so my results are a mixed bag. I will also describe what changes I am making, they are just minor ones.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hi FxMir, as promised I am putting my results in for the last week. I ended up negative, but like I mentioned I was testing few things last week, hence the reason why I ended up negative. I'd rather test things in live account rather than in demo as emotions always play big part in my trading. I will be testing my new rules next week as well and I will post my new rules as soon as I will end up positive for the week with new rules. I am currently doing a lot of backtesting and trying to work through different scenarios. Just to give you a quick snapshot on what I am working on it, please see the below: 1. 30 minute chart - 20 50 and 100 EMA all in line or price just crossed 100 EMA (up or Down) but already below 20 and 50 EMA (20 and 50 ema in line, up or down) - I use this for trend recognition on the 30 minute time frame. I used to wait for all the EMAs to be in line on the 30 minute, however the trend usually already developed on the 5 minute and I was getting late into the game. 2nd rule of the 30 minute chart is to look at the CCI (I will go into it later in the thread). 2. 5 minute chart. Usually when 20 and 50 ema is in line on the 30 minute chart the 20 50 and 100 EMAs is already lined up on the 5 minute chart. This is when I look for the pullback to finish on the 5 minute. ( I also use CCI for it ). Again I will get in to it as soon as I get the rules in place in all different scenarios. 3. 1 minute chart. When 5 minute is finishing the pullback it means that 1 minute rainbow is usually lined up in a different direction. I look for the 1 minute chart to go in the 5 minute direction. Usually what happens is when 1 minute crossed the purple rainbow WVMAs it goes in hand with the 5 minute finished pullback. I also use 1 minute CCI to time my entry, but like I said I am working on the exact rules. Once I get that figured out I will post them in here. In the meantime please see the results for the last week. I got nothing to hide, i am working on the strategy as we speak, but I got a huge faith in it.
