I have finally discovered a natural law based on Astro factors that control the movement in market. Many people have been following my turning points on a daily basis, now I want to share with traders here as well.. ================================================================================================= I am attaching the Futuristic Looking Turning Point Indicator. Latest version (Additional new model included, everyone must install this,with improved trendlines. ) , some fixes included and it will show Signal if generated on Live bar. If other files are already installed then just copy TurningPoints.ex4 in indicator folder and Astro.csv in MQL/Files folder Attached File(s) TurningPoints(13).zip 2.3 MB | 3,520 downloads | Uploaded Oct 4, 2019 11:21am Attached File(s) TurningPoints.ex4 457 KB | 2,332 downloads | Uploaded Oct 4, 2019 11:22am If you have old version installed then please download Astro.csv file with extended data again from the .Zip file into MQL\Files folder.

(There is a new parameter, show_trendlines=true/false. This will automatically display trendlines near turning points and support resistance.) ------------------------------------ All versions below this are obsolete Attachment Attached File(s) TurningPoints(11).zip 1.2 MB | 3,850 downloads | Uploaded Oct 3, 2016 5:06am Attachment Attachment (Wait for 45 sec to 1 min to allow it to complete calculations, if stuck for more than 2-3 min then kill and restart MT4) Note: Combining with old lagging indicators will not be beneficial, need to re-train the mindset. Pg#16 &amp; Pg#17 are good for learning tips with visual examples from traders and question and answers I am attaching the Turning Points indicator for people to watch and follow.. Some components of it are still evolving and some features will be added later on… Note:- Attach this to 1hr EURUSD or other Main Pair chart. Copy files as follows: Swedll32dll --&gt; MQL\libraries Swisseph.mqh --&gt; MQL\include Astro.csv --&gt; MQL\files TurningPoints.ex4 --&gt; MQL\indicator Macd_Colored_v103.ex4 --&gt; MQL\indicator JMASlope.ex4 --&gt; MQL\indicator gmtoffset in parameters is set automatically for your broker, but if you need then can be overwritten. This has calendar built in until end of Jan-2016. If color bars don’t appear at same points or if your account is not recognized in the chart then let me know.. Indicator displays, Breakout Signals mixed with another strategy, on the chart and running potential Profit run for the number of bars selected. This may help in understanding on how one can trade, another strategy will be reversal signals. For those interested in using Turning Points to manually trade themselves, can set the parameter Strategy= Manual if using as standalone for manual trading decisions, tips to consider: 1) I watch the intensity and speed of the move into the turning point, likelihood of breakout vs reversal decision 2) for breakouts I watch preceding 2 bar high/lows and a little longer support/resistance levels , if I am taking reversal trade then these high/lows act as stop and potential breakout trades if near important news time. 3) If the price action going into Turning Point does not look good then it is not necessary to take every trade at every turning poin t, just few trades at only selected turning points can give you 40-50% returns in a month with good money management and moderate risk. 4) My average profit for each Turning Point trade is 40-60 pips, if price is extended and supported by trend forecast then I can go for over 100 pips and likewise if it is slow moving then I may go for just 20-30 pips profit. 5) If I get just 5-6 such good trades in a month then a lot money can be made and we are getting that in 1 week itself. For those interested in using Turning Points to use AutoSignal Strategy Strategy= AutoSignals Note: One has to agree that automation can sometimes give loosing trades which may appeared like you should not have taken, but it is the longer term result that gives you net gain of that order. In this version indicator does not give live signal on the current bar. But it will be included in later version. Indicator will display all trades that would have been taken by this strategy and on last check, for last 5months starting Jul'15 to Nov'22nd, it generated 1700 pips ( You can see the running profit/loss in the indicator window at bottom. So if one starts with like $6000 or $7000 then you can expect to have got more than 200% ROI in this time period. (Results can be vary in different time periods depending on volatility and market conditions). Looking at the the profit/loss curve one can see drawdowns or when losses occur. *********************************************************************************************************** I request all traders to have patience and do not be greedy. Don't immediately jump into trade unless price movement looks attractive. You can make lot of money using this indicator in your trading decision but need to wait and divide your capital and start with low percentage of capital to trade. First observe the past behavior of price movement around Turning Point Signals. *********************************************************************************************************** Examples forecast Turning Point charts.. See how 12th &amp; 13th Nov reacted to the turning points and watch upcoming time also... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) abhay

Intrigued! And subscribed!

abhay can you share with us this indicator ??

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi Abhay, Thank you for deciding to share your hard work. Looking forward to more with much respect.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
this is the most absurd thing i have ever heard , no one can predict markets ,because to predict markets you are predicting human nature and that cannt be done .

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hello abhay, Thank you for this thread. Your turning points are pretty good Yesterday, 12.11.15 Mars went into Libra 22:23 (GMT + 1). That could be an indication for a falling Euro for today. We will see. Thanks for sharing your results with us.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Human nature is the one thing that can be predicted.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Interesting topic. W.D. Gann also thought that astro affects the human nature and markets behaviour. Where do you get all this info to predict turning points?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
This is absurd how many of you will actually trade like this with real money ????? how many of you ????

--- 帖子 #10 ---
+/- 5%

maybe this is not your type of thread... no need to be crass

sry u r r8 i cannt force my opinion on you

--- 帖子 #13 ---
xdj3richo, i don't know what you base your trades on. But how can you be sure that your "signs" are more reliable than astro ? I mean, Indicators in general are based on what happened in the past =&gt; somehow that is like saying "there is a cycle to use" Fundi trading is based on expectations for the future given a present situation =&gt; if you can predict, there is a pattern, or cycle We all are looking for "our special type of cycle" to trade with. Why not something out of the market ? No offense to astro trading, or for any other kind of analysis, but even a broken clock is right twice a day... And i don't know about you guys, but i have often found such kind of "coincidences" on a small number of occurences, but the reliability on the long term was always disappointing

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Just hold tight and keep visiting often, foundation of your beliefs and knowledge may be about to be shaken... keep looking at the charts...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Compare the chart to the one posted before.... Note: The accuracy is within 1 or 2 bars before or after the Turning Point, most often it is almost accurate to within 1 bar. I look at Highs &amp; Lows of preceeding 2 bars, if they are broken then I try to look for breakout/breakdown trade or if speed of movement is slow then I look for reversal trade.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
So, how do we go about finding these turning points in advance?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
The morning turn in EURO was posted showing the future turning points clearly displayed and now you can see how the price has very nicely turned exactly on the TP. It will be short turn as Friday coming to close.. I closed my SELL trade at the beginning of the TP and added very small BUY which I will close soon.. To all the skeptics ... keep watching and be prepared to change your belief system.. Compare to chart in Post #15 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks in advance for sharing dada. Can't wait to become a millionaire by following your turning points. God bless you!

The naysayers are those that don't believe in astrology. Mr. Gann did extensive research into this and used astrology to his advantage. Astrology is an "observational science". An astrologer can't predict on November 17 that you will break a leg, but an astrologer could say within a period of time that something may happen to you physically so watch out. I'll give you one more analogy....astrology is like driving with windshield wipers in the rain....if you don't have the windshield wipers you can drive but it would be more difficult. Looking forward to what is shared positively on this thread...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
You intrigued me. Want to see more...

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Such an inmature gesture. If you don't believe in it, just don't read the thread. No need to thrash...

Abhay, will this work on renko charts? I will be glad to try it on them. Bob

I believe it's based on time.. so no. But i could be wrong.

If I were you I wouldn't quit. This is a very interesting enlightment for all of us who are interested. The shallow, or one track minded people would be eliminated as time passes. So if I were you I would stick to my beliefs. Two quotes from Henry Ford: Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it. Coming together is a beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is success.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
why let others control what you do here ? simply ban the muggles .. many folks here are interested .. be well

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thank you for offering to share your insights Abhay... just a shame about the nonbelievers. This quote springs to mind.... " Those that say it cannot be done, should get out of the way of those doing it!" Personally, I have been trying to work out a way to backtest the changing aspects and I must say the orbs you have on your charts using the different background colors are quite visually effective. Was this difficult to code? Are orbs manually drawn to the chart, or does the code reference an ephemeris?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I have no idea if this works, or not, but would like to see/hear more about it. Can see no reason for these yahoos to be yucking it up. One would think with all the millions they must surely make from their own systems, they would be relaxing on their yacht somewhere, playing with their bikini babes, rather than causing a nuisance here. Put distractions on your ignore list and they won't be able to disrupt...

Good topic...i know it works sometimes. But not as a standalone system. You need other confirmation too. Longer Aspects works better.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I think everyone who is using technics based on natural laws should be used to such offenses. It is how it is. The best way to make them think is to show them such results like abhay did. I really was interested in these Astro Turning Point Indicators and was looking forward to see if they always work. If it does than abhay has made a big discovery. Astrobased Technics improved my timing in Trading, but everyone has to find his own way.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I think he never meant to share his method and indicator in 1st place. This was a showing off thread for him with intention to gaining praises.. But unfortunately for him, he saw many negative responses instead.. Â How I came to that conclusion? We know he already showed us the appearance of his Indi bragging about the predictions and all, and yet he later said he was still working on the codes?? So the indie he showed the SS with was a flawed one..? What's that about..? Â So my final conclusion is there never was an Astro based Turning Points indi.. He just made it up and aprilfooled you this November..ÂÂ

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I wonder why you had to post a snapshot of your live trades results, after saying you'll stop posting here.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
better and better: astrology, alliens maybe i should start a thread named "area 51"

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I think he wanted to find customers for the indicator. And I guess he managed to get his message box filled with PM's from newbies begging him to sell the area-51 indicator to them...

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Abhay, Id like to see your turning points. Do you have them for the other USD crosses? I like to see a USDCAD as I am USA trader and is best mover for NY open. If you are sharing the Indi instead, I'd like to try it. The naysayers to planetary effects on humans can turn their backs on the ocean if they are so inane!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Okay Indie Beggars, Â Enough begging Abhay.. You could find the sets of the indie hereÂ https://www.mql5.com/en/code/2227 for FREE. It's for MT5 chart though.Â Couldn't find the MT4 version. Â You may need to BEG that author instead, if you really want to..Â Â Â

Wibie, Good looking out! Even in your own smart-alecy way.

Cant wait to see that!

I have been thinking about it.... I will resume posting on a limited basis. Negative people are only a small part for not posting but it made me realize not all people deserve to get this... also I am now aware of how to block the people who are bent upon positing negative due to their vested interests. So for today, another turning point is now almost on the horizon and EURUSD has made a nice move into it. So I am looking to short and add more with confirmation. My trend Forecast indicates that next week it will resume downward movement into sideways range... So it looks a very safe trade... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Nice work! Are your calculations/ indicator specific to a particular currency? Pardy

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I mainly focus on EURUSD but other trader have used on other main pairs and most of the times they react at same times..

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Abhay I'm glad you have recovered from the stone throwing bully boys. Understandably some would like to get their mitts on your indicator but what I would like to know is more about the colour coded columns on your charts, what they represent and how you interporate them ? Thanks for coming back

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks for this thread, I am very intrigued with this philosophy of trading. Would like to know more.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
EURO again reacted to the Astro turning point and currently is running into a wall, so price does not seem to be going anywhere.. What is more important for people interested in it is to follow how price reacts around these points, often +/- 1 bar and other times +/- 2bar accuracy. Some members may want to get their hands on it ASAP but it will be more effective once you start getting comfortable with what kind of reactions happen and when you should enter the trade and what to do to protect the trade... Compare with the previous chart and you will note Green Turning Point was already forecasted yesterday.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #75 ---
May I ask how much draw down you normally have?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
So nice, subscribed, count me on~ Thanks, buddy!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
That will depend on the strategy you are using. Personally for me, I have been using this indicator for last 3-4 weeks and my equity has gone up about 60% since then and hopefully by another 1 or 2 weeks it should be 100% up and all trades have closed in profit. For me, I also have the trend forecast so I knew that the trend was overall down for these weeks and anytime I saw a nice move up into turning point then I would establish my positions in 2 or 3 portions to make sure the move is complete. In one of the previous trade I started establishing short position (20% of capital) from 1.0725 (an hour before the turning point) and price move 35 pips against but once I was confirmed of move completion into the turning point the price was between 1.0750 - 1.0760, then I added rest as the speed had slowed down and it became stagnant so breakout did not look likely.. 1) I watch the intensity and speed of the move into the turning point, likelihood of breakout vs reversal decision 2) for breakouts I watch preceding 2 bar high/lows and a little longer support/resistance levels , if I am taking reversal trade then these high/lows act as stop and potential breakout trades if near important news time. 3) If the price action going into Turning Point does not look good then it is not necessary to take every trade at every turning poin t, just few trades at only selected turning points can give you 40-50% returns in a month with good money management and moderate risk. 4) My average profit for each Turning Point trade is 40-60 pips, if price is extended and supported by trend forecast then I can go for over 100 pips and likewise if it is slow moving then I may go for just 20-30 pips profit. 5) If I get just 5-6 such good trades in a month then a lot money can be made and we are getting that in 1 week itself. Anyone interested in my indicator should read these points many times to be really aware of when using it to trade...

--- 帖子 #78 ---
very interesting indicator! subscribed

--- 帖子 #79 ---
unbelievable... no trustworthy theoretical foundation ("asTROLLogy"), no statistical sagnificance, no proof of trading history - and still increasing number of followers. you have been warned, don´t cry after your account has been vaporized. anyway, best of luck for the believers...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I thought about putting stop loss and moving along previuos bar .Depends if its long or short trade.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Yet again, last turning point is being hit... the down move nicely comes round to the Turning Point and will pause, if you were planning on doing something, it is a confidence factor. for guidelines refer to tips in post #77 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...06#post8603106 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Looks great,, Keep up the good work..

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Am I missing something? Has the indicator been shared already?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
No.I just edited the picture

--- 帖子 #85 ---
this thing can work.dont look for every turn point. look for astro events where are common and important and well known.human is superstitious especially traders/gamblers such as lunar eclipse ( I never interested in astro so this is the only thing I know ) and if I were you I would work only on eurusd for the start

--- 帖子 #86 ---
interesting, subscribing

--- 帖子 #87 ---
it is not so crazy as it looks, WD Gann used to do this stuff and he was very sucsessful in his time and is considered to be one of the best traders of all times

--- 帖子 #88 ---
so if I understand this correctly, the red bar means sideways market?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
It might sound daft but I read that someone used a method like this and made a fortune. It was reported in a British newspaper some years ago. I'm interested to learn more.. To all the naysayers who don't believe... KEEP ON USING THE same old, same old indicators and systems posted here. If all the so called indicators worked we would of be rich by now. Learn something new. Think outside the box a bit. Thanks to the OP for sharing and if you don't believe stay of the thread and go try the latest indicator that promises the world.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thanks Abhay

--- 帖子 #92 ---
thanks for sharing...... subscribe

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Glad to see you back, Abhay. I've been studying astrology since 1992, and never ever let myself being involved by anyone who was simply an attacker or skeptical. I never felt I had to prove anything to anyone. So, if you wish, you can ignore such kind of people. Like any other thing in universe, only people attracted by your work will be following you. Best wishes. PS: I have some short experience in playing with Timing Solutions. If you would like some support in research, I'm ready - though in limited time. PPS: i think EURUSD might be especially 'manipulated', compared to other crosses. If you got such brilliant results with it, i believe you could outperform with other currencies.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Very well said, ignoring the arrogant is the best medicine.

abhay, thanks for sharing! Looking forward of your indicator. Thanks!

I believe the trustworthy theoritical foundation you've acquired still gat you searching? &amp;quot; Millionaires don't use astrology, billionaires do&amp;quot;.Thank you Abhay, I have albeen been interested in your work.Warm Regards FM

wow i was a non believer but after abhay gave me the indicator for free and taught me how to use it ,i have to say it works great .Thanks alot abhay u have been really helpful .This indicator has actually improved my trading

--- 帖子 #98 ---
looks good, how do I get the indicator ?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
How about posting some screenshots of your last trades using this indicator . Just drag and drop them onto the chart. A picture says a thousand words Thanks in advance. H

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I am pretty close to completing the first version of the indicator. If all goes well I may be able to release today or in a couple of days. The astro indicator is already complete but I want to release it with some kind of strategy built in as well otherwise many struggling traders find it difficult to use it in trading. I just need to verify if things are working ok...

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Great news Abhay. Hope we will see it soon.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Looking forward to it. Could you in advance give the turning point times, as I would like to compare those with something astro related ( using electional/ horary astro) I have been working on. Perhaps we could then pool ideas to get to more accuracy.

Abhay, glad to see the negativity didn't stop you. waiting to try it out! Bob

--- 帖子 #104 ---
i wont post the trades as i have promised abhay .Ask him he will give it to you for free .Get ready to make huge amout from this indicator

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Abhay well done for keeping going, I was thinking that the fibo is an indicator that relates to humanistic charaterisctics so why not astro. Obviously a lot of questions about how this works especially on an hourly basis, I am 3 hours ahead of GMT does that affect the timing of the turning points? Or do you just compensate with a time offset?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I have now included an automatic offset to adjust for time differences.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Your continuous efforts and hardwork is truly appreciated. Thank you. Awaiting your kind reply. Cant wait to test it out and be a part of this group to see if we can improve it if needed to take it to the next level.

Hey Abhay when do you share the indicator?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Not at all, for people not familiar with this technique think it is all same. The other thread is like reading horoscopes in newspaper every sunday. This is a technique mentioned in veiled/coded secret language by WD Gann (a legendary trader) and I just re-discovered it. You may find lot of people posting about astrology or moon aspects, but they have no idea of this Natural Law that exists and affects the movement... To those asking what account is required, I need MT4 account and name on account, I need to keep out those who are not deserving of this and I don't have any other way to do that.

The Astro Turning Points Indicator has been uploaded in Post#1 Please read instructions and wait for 30-45 sec for it to complete calculations and load and request all traders to have patience and do not be greedy. Don't immediately jump into trade unless price movement looks attractive. You can make lot of money using this indicator in your trading decision but need to wait and divide your capital and start with low percentage of capital to trade. First observe the past behavior of price movement around Turning Point Signals.

Sometimes price can turn on both sides of Turning Point... like it happened today.. Attached Image (click to enlarge) ************************************************************************************************************ The Astro Turning Points Indicator has been uploaded in Post#1 Please read instructions and wait for 30-45 sec for it to complete calculations and load and request all traders to have patience and do not be greedy. Don't immediately jump into trade unless price movement looks attractive. You can make lot of money using this indicator in your trading decision but need to wait and divide your capital and start with low percentage of capital to trade. First observe the past behavior of price movement around Turning Point Signals.

Is indicator not showing in Indicator List or not drawing any lines? Recheck instructions if you copied all files in required folders. Do not forget to enable DLL. Do you get any error message ? Check, in experts Tab for any error message?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Check allow dll imports.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
In my expert journal there is an error -can`t open macd colored

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thanks, the allow DLL made it work.

Great work Abhay. Thank you

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Dear Abhay, thanks a lot for sharing your amazing indicator. Will you please advise which currency pairs and other trade instruments is it suitable for? What does different color and width of vertical lines mean?

Hey guyz went through the thread really liked the work . I would like to use the indicator aswell can anyone share it with me thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #159 ---
There is a zip file on first post now with loading instructions.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks for the reply. Its giving n error of account not authorised

--- 帖子 #161 ---
OK, then you need to PM Abhay. He will ask you for your mt4 account no. and name as he is restricting the indie.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Should it looks like this ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Looks like our lines are slightly out of time. one of us may have wrong time zone. i will check. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #164 ---
What time is everyone in agreement with for the next turning point? My charts say 17:00 but kubiasty chart says 18:00. If we can agree on this then i can adjust my chart to be on same page as everyone else.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
My is OK, I compare my charts with abhay.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Abhay can you give us more examples ? When to enter trade? What does means the colors ?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
OK thanks. I have changed mine now to the same.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
EURO has already reacted to the Turning Point and is heading up into the wall of events. GOLD colored lines are high energy points but seem to be late in the day that is slower in movement, so will have to be watchful Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #169 ---
OK GOLD - high energy Grey Light blue ? low energy ? or something else

--- 帖子 #171 ---
abhay msged you my account no kindly check the mail thanks

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I think you can delete the .mq4 or re-copy .ex4 and do not try to recompile it as it needs to be modified to be compatible with new MT4.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Abhay, what is difference between two zipped files attached at the first page?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
No code change, just additional account authorizations. When I include any functionality change then I will mention in the update that it contains new features or enhancements.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
abhay, thank you for the indicators, now I will study them. What are the pink and blue arrows, should we only be trading in this direction? Do they repaint? Thanks for your hard work. Please take you time to answer I know you are busy my friend.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
My apologies, as my PM is limited to 3 per day hence I could not alter the wrong info. I will PM you tomorrow. Thanks

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Couple questions to abhay - What are these lines ? Blue, pink, red ... ? - GOLD - high energy -red - low energy? -grey - what does means that zone? -arrows looks are not neccessary useless Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #178 ---
hummm... i like the strong smell of bullshit in the morning. i was already suspicious from the first post, but now thats downright ridiculous how long before this thread goes to the commercial area ? or even better, the trash were it really belongs?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Don't worry too much about other colors, it will take me long time to classify each, I have a lot of work to do. But GOLD is high energy points, others are equally relevant so don't filter them out. Each turning point is important and the move size may correspond to the time of the day, news time.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I'm getting the feeling he's running a lot of it himself. I'm seeing new members signing up within the last 72 hours willing to fork over personal information for an indicator? Real people can't possibly be that stupid. To be honest, I'm surprised mods would allow someone to run a thread soliciting for names and account numbers. Wait, nevermind. I'm not surprised at all.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thank you! Now I am ready.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
EURO drops before the turning point and then Turns again right on time... There is a heavy zone of events from here, so I will look to SELL if this short period move appears to be completing.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thanx a lot for the indy, Dada ! I took the opposite entry buy right after I saw a bull candle on the grey area and also looking at the previous Daily candle. (although it's still in the bearish trend zone). Let's hope for the best. Best regards !

--- 帖子 #184 ---
"...Since it is small range day zone, will look to sell..." Why small range day zone means SELL ? Best wishes! Thanks for everything abhay!

--- 帖子 #185 ---
All I can say is WOW... It just went crazy up..... If any don't believe now they're idiots. Made a quick $1000 and got out before it turned. I'll follow this like a hawk. Thanks abhay

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Because there are no news items and it is not moving much, so most likely will keep moving in a range. I was watching the trendline for reversal trade as it is in the Turning Point zone already and more turning points coming.. So a reversal trade which would have been a SELL would have materialized to profitable trade. STOP would have been above the trendline. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Thanks my friend! Abhay, so you will SELL when Stochastic show its high? Or which method you use to enter position?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Kindly check mail abhay i m still getting account not authorised error . Thanks

--- 帖子 #189 ---

Greetings, am new here and got interested in the stuff you shared, being a contrarian trader, this method fascinate me well, Great job you are doing. l actually downloaded the file, inserted them and it shows , account not authorised, contact { email address deleted by staff } . pls what do l do. thanks

abhay do you sell EU now ?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
​Thank you for your generosity Abhay. In addition to fx, I am trying the indicator on indices that are offered through MT4, but the vertical lines don't show - just the "future times" on index charts. The fx pairs I have tried do have the vertical lines. ​

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thanks abhay its working now . just want to know 2 more things do i have to change the timing of my comp to match ? and what does the colors and numbers on etreme right of timings show thanks

Can you show me last demand ?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi Abhay, Thanks again for activating the indicator. My GMT Offset is +2, but the indicator shows it as +3. Can I change it to 2 ? Could you kindly explain the difference between the various colour bars - what do they indicate? Thanks in advance. Roy

--- 帖子 #198 ---
A bit of Astro-Renko-Tma eye candy for you before i go to bed.... Just looking for a way to take advantage of these zones. Unfortunately I cant trade now until next tue. doh! will be checking the reactions to these zones each eve though. Thanks Abhay for a most interesting indicator and thankyou for the time you must have spent creating this. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The GOLD colored bars and followed immediately by RED turning point gave the bounce to EURO (normally not an expected move at this time) but we have been watching this time. I have a feeling 1 or 2 bars after RED timing point, it may turn down, watching if momentum fades then will SELL for some 20-25 pips move. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #205 ---
WoW !! It happened ! After 2 bars it goes down 20 pips ! Abhay can you explain more how did you predict that ? So If there GOLD high energy and closer red energy give push in one side in non-important time, then it will be back soon ? How to read it?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
The reasoning is that if such strong Turning Points were present and price had sneaked UP from GOLD bar to 1 bar after RED It was slow moving time period without any reason, then turning point looked almost 90% sure and should have happened within 1 or 2 bar accuracy, based on the move I noticed 1.0645-1.0655 was support price, so I expected from 1.0675 it should give a move down of 20-25 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Aha ok i think i get it this example, thanks Another question: Why there wasn't reversal? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Abhay you are great! Please stay with us! I want to learn from you.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
It won't always be reversal, sometimes depending on time and intensity of move there can be breakout right around the Turning Point. So I watch previous 2-3 bars high &amp; Lows for breakout

--- 帖子 #209 ---
To be honest, he is only getting the account number, name does not matter. He doesn't even get broker name or detail, why what is the harm?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Anyone else willing to reply ?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Ron, you may install Windows on VirtualBox or VMware and run indicator. It is also the way out. alex.

Running MT4 on Mint 17.2 (ubuntu) ​Follow this: ​ https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1358 ​But instead of Win1.5, download the stable release 1.6 ​Once you have Wine installed, go to metatrader4.com, download the .exe, and open with Wine Windows Program Loader. ​Once installed, open and enter your server details. ​Good luck.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) This was a good one! Small Risk - Great Profit (even though with small money). Thanks abhay. Hope it will give us more such clear indications.

Abhay why he got RED and i got grey zone This same ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi I may have missed the answer to my question in the thread. But if i load the indicators it gives me a message that the account is not authorized. Could someone please advise.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Me too. You have to PM Abhay with your MT4 Account no. as mentioned in other posts. I'm still waiting but I guess he's busy.....

--- 帖子 #218 ---
It says unauthorized account and send an email to address shown on screen...

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Very nice move and nice to see EURO react at the turning point. Now I am watching the next turning point, coming soon for a retrace bounce. *Remember sometimes in can be 1 bar before or even 2 bars after the turning point The price pattern forming will give you some idea.. And don't put all the capital in one trade.... My trend forecast indicates some kind of bottom will soon start forming form late this week into next week... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi adhay, I have send the email. thx Gogelpot

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Working now, thanks

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Thanks Abhay! All is showing up nicely. Just want to check with you, if I set the strategy to Auto, even when the Turning Point indie is not an expert, it will trade by itself?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
What do the different bar colors mean? And when do you sell and buy depending on what?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
So we buy now EU ?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I have taken some BUY position now, will look some ore price patter before adding and if it looks stable into turning point, then will add more and target will be some 20-25 pips as of now but will adjust depending on the movement. One thing to note with upcoming holiday, market may become dead soon.. manpowerup, it will not trade on it's own, this is indicator but will show you where and how the automated strategy would have generated a trade. I am planning to soon create an expert also that will actually be able to trade. At the bottom you can see the performance of autostrategy in pips, change bars backwords =3000 or 3500 and you will see at the bottom how many pips it would have generated and if you scroll back you get an idea of drawdowns... All those who have provided account number and name and still getting unauthorised error ... please download the latest version from the post #1

--- 帖子 #226 ---
So Abhay do you think its a bottom for the next week ? Abhay do you hold your position buy EU ? Where do you set up SL ?

--- 帖子 #227 ---
hi abhay, i attached all in your instruction but shows invalid account. my account are 1) 6274233= exness demo 2) 189887 = pepperstone demo02 Pls attache two account in your system. Safiul

--- 帖子 #228 ---
No one can be ever dead sure about that. It also depends on your strategy and with-holding power. Like I will be ok if it goes 50 pips or may be 100 pips lower if I think potential to upside is greater than downside risk. and it is surely going to bounce higher than these levels... That is why manual trading is different than Auto trading. it is in my plans to convert this to an Expert Advisor as well, it will have some loosing trades but overall profit is far higher than expectations. Now this move is looking good into the turning point.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Abhay.... Have you tried this on any shorter time frames. (All working now, thanks).

--- 帖子 #230 ---
So all lines are turning points?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
It seems that way. More info to follow no doubt.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Yes, as my research continues if I find some events more likely then I will update but so far in auto strategy I have tested what works best from auto signals point of view. If anyone switches to Manual strategy you may see some extra signals, Auto strategy ignores some turning points because it gives overall higher result but those turning points may still be helpful in manual. But for not good traders, Auto signal will be worth it.

abhay ami amar a/c number inbox korechi. active kore dao pls

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Watch this screenshot now and the Turning Point. Since we are already having a good move UP within the Turning Point at this time of the day, so it is likely it may turn down after the Turning Point. We call this turning on both sides... Watch for loss of momentum when it moves with in 1 bar before and 1 or 2 bars after the Turning Point then you are likely to get turn on both sides... So if you observe more and more you will start noting the patterns of price movement around Turning Points... Good profit very timely received... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I feel that now it is loosing the momentum.... looking to add to short term SELL until next Turning Point. May be small move ??

--- 帖子 #240 ---
oh Eureka! Do you have better indicator?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I could hear the penny drop from miles away!

--- 帖子 #242 ---
No, it is not only reversal, but also the breakouts happen around these points... It is this one filter that everyone has been searching, a filter to avoid unproductive periods, zones when most productive trades can be made... Every single day since I started using this indicator I have made money... When people advise have patience, then first question is how and till what time ? when should they jump in? Yes this gives you that reference in time till what time to wait and that helps you see the real move open up or be prepared to take action...

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thanks for sharing this Abhay, we really appreciate it. Will there be a 'final' version that's paid for?

long audnzd after turning point --early as I coud have waited for TL break Big move soon ?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Using it on 5min timeframe, in my opinion may distort the perception of turning point, as it is designed for 1hr timeframe granularity, and we watch like from 1 bar before to 3 bars after, but with 5min you will not know when it is imminent... may be you are comfortable with that... So like in current move on EURUSD, the current candle started turning down and previous was exhaustion of move UP so I knew another turning happening. But on 5min how would I have used it *not sure*

--- 帖子 #247 ---
But on 5min how would I have used it *not sure*[/quote] The good thing about the 5 min chart is you can get in early.! The bad is it can get you in too early. LOL. Pick your poison..

I am not sure what to do with the upcoming TP. With the two TPs before it was obvious but here I do not have a clear picture. Better to leave this one out or ?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
STARTrader1 &amp; boxferret .... that is the correct attitude and decision. Just remember, if on average in a month you can get 200-300 pips then you can make lot of money. This indicator is giving many more trades, don't be greedy and do not try to grab every trade unless price movement is looking safe and predictable, not in danger of running away from your perceived direction (unless you are ready for breakout level trades..) Just 4 or 5 good trades in a week will keep you very happy and I am getting much more......

--- 帖子 #252 ---
This is awesome actually. You can look at chart and see when you should come back and look for set ups. Means you can go and do something else with your life and come back at the right time for looking for trades. This is a potential game changer! Can't wait for Tuesday now. Keep up good work Abhay.

Too bad plotting the turning box indi removes all other plotted material on charts, such as horizontal lines and rectangles. I wish to hybrid experiment some with my own lines. Is there any way to have turning points not remove other objects? Thanks for your fine work so far

Just change timeframe to another one and back again or reload template. Should auto-update, but it's work in progress? Just double click them to fix them on screen - they default to 'highlighted'

Its people like you that need your head examined, the astro side of things has a huge influence in the markets, the markets can be predicted in advance, Gann did it, and I he is not the only one, quite a few people on the forum can do it. Hats off to the lad that wrote this it is a work of genius, you should be happy that someone share a great deal of hard work with you.

Hi. Its just the osma indicator found in your mt4 indicator folder. I put blue lines on myself. I find on the 3 brick renko that it identifies divergence nicely. This combined with a turning point could be very useful to determine direction astro energy will take price I'm thinking. Hoping to test this from Tuesday.

Thanks Noni - wasn't sure if the new colours were part of the upgrade. Fixed now.

Seems like the signal gave SELL trade and is working out good in slow market. Although I did not take that as market is very slow but should be good for 15-20 pips.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
100% agreed. These type of systems are sure way of losing your money.

Today's turn in EUR, even though the market is almost dead. As it is getting close to the next turning point, I may BUY some , although the market is dead and the time of day is also slow period, but this may give 10-15 pips, will watch price action... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks for your pointless contribution to this thread. Abhay has posted his trades for all to see, perhaps take a look?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Don't you just love the non believers... All those with there useless indicators. All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident. I wonder in a month or so the non believers will be asking for there copy because we are all making money. Thanks Abhay. Keep up the awesome work.

Signs of turning again at the Green Turning Point... although market is slow so will look for small profit accordingly. If MACD closes in green (2 consecutive green), then SELL trade will be closed... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #315 ---
So this is for sell situation? Why not buy ? Trend sell was all day

--- 帖子 #316 ---
It was already in SELL, do you see Pink Down arrow at previous turning point. Here I was looking to BUY and bought some.. looking for small profit a good UP candle and half retrace was a good sign of turning point in BUY direction...

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I believe a closer look will show i is possible that 3 day trend will bounce today...if combine with previous Astro cycle chart we see 9am is more often a consistent time-frame for SOME sort of transition in the daily cycles to occur...SO whether trend UP or DOWN for day it would be prudent to look for re-position or bounce either way around these times. In my experience it is better to risk 12 ticks here that a bounce will occur rather than any other times since Astro cycle is possible "Natural" supply or demand area. using a trailing stop will result in more profits than losses, hopefully. still its better than risking 12 ticks holding a buy overnight without knowing which Astro cycle of that day will have largest move and taking such a higher risk trade is NOT how the expert pros do it. eur/usd also trades normally in same direction as cad/eur which would have been much better "overnight" Buy into morning bullish Astro cycle risking only 12 ticks.. ..wise man , excuse me...wise woman once told me "Trade Like Expert, Win Like Pro..."

--- 帖子 #318 ---
So if the last turning point was DOWN ARROW, so then next trade you search for buy entry at turning point ?? Attached Image (click to enlarge) SO we have now BLUE UP ARROW, so we look for sell next turning point right ??

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Can you show me where EURO turned to up? Last arrow was pink down , and bearish trend and i dont see there turn up? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks for all Abhay! I Appreciate your hard work ! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #320 ---
it depends on what you are looking at ?? You are fixated on larger trends and larger moves. I am spotting the moves according to the time of the day and momentum of the move. If the time of the day is not supporting big move then I am looking for intra - moves for smaller profit, just 1 or 2 or 3 small profit totaling 20-30 pips in a day is also good on a slow day. So I always see the price action going in to the Turning Point time and then know what is going to happen next depending on momentum. If momentum is high then yo get a continuation or breakout trades... See the comments in Gold color Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #321 ---
So do I understand now correct? Attached Image (click to enlarge) At the first point at the morning of the london session there was strong move up, so when do you enter sell there ??

--- 帖子 #322 ---
So the "turning points" are not turning points but areas to expect a move up or down? Correct?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
So where to enter in this case? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Turning Points are usually the best points to initiate a trade. breakouts or continuation trades are far less in %. Watching Trendline break of previous 3-5 bars or even more if trendline is clear is very helpful but for autosignals I am using MACD as a detector and the breakout of support/resistance of previous bars. So the Pink &amp; Blue lines that you see on the charts are the levels that the autosignal strategy is watching and the dashed line you see shifted above or below to these solid lines are the stops. This is one part of strategy and other is using MACD. Right now, my trend forecast shows we are putting in short term bottom and next few days to next week we may see bounces, sort of sideways bounce and selling. So with partial capital I am buying and holding until I get 30-50 pip profit and other part of capital I am keeping available if I get good turning point.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
manually trading, I would be watching the trendline break as highlighted in GOLD color... because of the range of move. if range was not as much then maybe the way you have shown.. A little later, I will incorporate trendlines as well in AutoSignals... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #326 ---
So we sell if trendlines break? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Tips for Trade: 1) Break of Trendline of 3-5 bars before or near the Turning Point is a good trade method 2) I also look for break of support &amp; resistance of previous few 2-3 &amp; 8-10 bars for a breakout trade and stops 3) If there is no likelyhood of a breakout then I look for confirmation from MACD for a reversal. When I incorporate the trendlines in autosignal then it may possibly be a good signal method as well.. 4) I also look at the time of the day or if it is a slow day, then if price action of previous 3-5 bars is good going into the Turning Point then a reversal is most likely rather than a breakout... so I play for the profits depending on the move into the Turning Point. Always watching the momentum into the Turning Point or if a pending news time. Manually chart watching, there will always be some signals that will appear as not the best place or should not be taken. But when you develop a strategy, then you implement a consistent method, which may give some wrong signals or may miss some trades that you would have taken otherwise, but on long term you usually do not make good money. Pg#1, Pg#16, Pg#17 is good for people learning this indicator... should be bookmarked as there are lots of visual examples and questions and answers. So relying on an automated signal which gives consistent high returns over the period with some incorrect trades may be a better thing to do (for those not yet good manual traders) ..

Abhay, i turned Automated signal so what i have looking for? The EA will open trades for me automatically? Or i dont see differents ? Attached Image (click to enlarge) What is the different between Automatically signals and Manuall ? This line below is SL or TP ? or lowest low marked? Attached Image (click to enlarge) How automatical signals give the signals ? Some warning window ? or some arrow? or open auto trade?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I like to think of turning points defined by the Astro Cycles as like a "bow and arrow" during these times (bow) is when the arrow (time) is being pulled for an expected release and target with fastest momentum and tension. it is like riding a bicycle ..once you learn you never forget. master the Astro cycles and master yourself. will help you 100% become consistent winning trader. focus on your goal and attack it like a lion. read this thread front to back 2 maybe 3 maybe more times until the idea is engraved into your memory and your muscles.

Long Euro from current position with 35 tick stop should profit 35-50 ticks for intraday or 100+ ticks on 3+ day swing trade.. anyone else see this also?.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Very well said Kiingrex... Kubisty, Yes the dashed line that you see is the stop.. The difference between Autosignal Modes and Manual is : AutoSignal mode will eliminate some signals that in Automated Strategy are not helpful but for a Manual trader an important trade could be there on those signals. But assumption is that good manual trader, will be able to filter out those signals at other times (only price watching and trendlines watching required for that skill) But Autosignal method will always have some limitations because it uses consistent rules so net profit may drop if those signals are not eliminated. The indicator currently does not place the trade, but shows the simulation of the AutoSignal strategy. I am working on Expert Advisor for placing trades automatically using this strategy...

Ohh thanks Expert Advisor for this would be great!!!

cad/usd chf/usd cad/jpy cad/eur aud/usd gbp/usd all of these pairs normally trade in same direction as eur/usd, in case you basket trade. place position in each with 35 tick stops and let run until Fed announcement. possible great setup. compare (for you Kumbiasty 9am--) Astro cycle on each charts. keep a diary!

What a nice sudden move in EUR, the BUY signal triggered still valid. This is a very good example of how rationality will go against the move but on a percentage scale and long term AutoSignals will keep adding profit, which is almost impossible for 95% traders... To become profitable, it will need a change in mindset. Most people I see still keep doing what they have done all their trading lives and think of this just one more thing.... friends... think different... Trade the way this indicator works, something complimentary may be ok, but totally different style won't really help your purpose. I am watching if the momentum stalls then it will probably go DOWN into next Turning Point.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

practice makes perfect..

--- 帖子 #341 ---
This will not help anyone as this is neither connected to this indicator. If you have fully developed methodology then it might be better to post in a separate thread but welcome to post anything that can closely tie in to this indicator,so that traders don't get confused about this method.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Abhay I dis-agree. Every trader must trade his/her simulator practice account to gain experience with ANY method. The post is clearly a demonstration of using the Astro-cycle method in practice in actual trades. Do not expect to trade into million (billion) dollar profits in live account if you have not done in practice account 100 times...at least.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Ok agree...

--- 帖子 #344 ---
To me, this looks like loss in momentum. High on this bar was 1.0596 and is now 1.0581 and if it is not able to cross the high then this should be loss of momentum and I will be ready to take a SELL trade for small profit into next Turing Point

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Aussie Interest Rate decision in 25 mins... stay aware. I have 1.0477 - 1.0531 zone as MEGA BUY ZONE. Price is slow grinding down to that area. if does not reach that area then look for spike into 1.06333 for low risk Long. Best to wait until next HIGH INTENSITY Astro-Cycle for Euro then will see this bullish reversal flag that happens on down-trending markets since my great great grandfather. The Euro itself does have some "momentum" therefore I look for other pairs with less choppy noise, where momentum and higher volume like cad/jpy, put capital (soldiers) to work in this area this week may benefit twice as much with less risk stress tears etc that will disrupt our biological astro cycle within each of us. Abhay have you identified any relations within each "turning point"? Are there unique traits that we will remind us of what current Astro-cycle we are in? Does the automated strategy differentiate relations and character, other than time of day, of every daily astro-cycles for the market it trades? Having this info will help me to think of how astro-cycle also applies life internally (market psychology) also as I am planning my trades. I mean it will help me to memorize each Astro-cycle, its characteristics, traits, time-frame, etc. without depending so much on indicator.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
No, that is not the way this is traded. You do have a different method and that is fine but this is going to confuse others. Users here cannot discern which is high intensity and which is not. That is why a set of rules have been developed. You are just putting them in totally subjective direction and that is not the purpose of this thread. I am sorry....

--- 帖子 #347 ---
that question was for me personally... man calm down relax ..

--- 帖子 #348 ---
?? show me chart with your "indicator" and I guarantee you there is a YELLOW astro-cycle indication for the Aussie market during tonight's Aussie Interest Rate decision, indicating what I consider high intnsity astro-cycle. How do I know this and I don't even have your indicator??? Anyways you rather 99 uniterested students rather than 1 who is. i wont say anything else in YOUR thread. sir.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Maybe you could start your own thread about astro cycles. Show us how you come up with them and your way of thinking. Could be interesting. New to this trading style, but willing to learn..

--- 帖子 #350 ---
To me astro-cycle is all part of life. For example: 7am we wake up = new astro-cycle 12pm we eat lunch = new astro-cycle 5pm we get off work go home eat dinner = new astro cycle 10pm we go to sleep = new astro cycle same cycles apply to many areas etc of life. now apply to market price and investors. everything is natural do we not learn from experience. i was only asking what is Abhays method for memorizing important Astro-cycles for the markets he trades, without using indicator? my analysis of charts is NOT meant to TEACH anyone. a man must teach himself. so no need to feel the need to explain that i am attempting to teach anything. im a trader. if i do give away analysis and explanations its because i have a heart and care about the guy who is just like i was 15 years ago, clueless. if my question makes you offended than maybe something you no telling. i asked honest question. maybe i wasn't clear enough.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
You are not saying anything related to astro indicator, you don't even have one yet. Seems like you are intentionally trying to hijack the thread in wrong direction. None of your post connects anything to astro indicator. Posts like Kubiatsy made were helpful to others as well, he is posting scenarios and asking what to do and how to select. That helps....

Abhay, Pls have a look at the attached image where the same EURUSD 1H chart arranged side by side. Image on the left is couple of hrs before the image on the right. Only difference is that I restarted my MT4 platform before the screenshot on the right was taken. The version 5 of the turning point indicator is running. Auto signals option turned on Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see the shifting of the vertical lines (Turning Points) are still taking place. On top of that, pls look at arrow circled in red on the right hand side image. It was not there on the left image. I believe the indicator is suppose to throw out the signals on the live candle ? If so, not only it doesn't happen the way its intended and also doesn't appear even after few candles have passed. It only appeared when I restarted the MT4 platform. Am I doing something wrong or is it a bug ? Cheers ! D Edit - Pls note that the above image contains two screen shots separated by the white space running down the middle ! Its not a 'turning point' vertical line drawn by the indicator ! Just thought of mentioning it as it could get confusing !!!

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Check the timestamp of turningpoints.ex4 with that in the zip file. If it matches then it should work correctly otherwise try to copy once again after closing mt4, I do not see the issue on my side.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Abhay, well done on all your hard work, its appreciated, subscribed

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Being an astro indicator does this mean that the same time zones/turning points apply to all pairs and indicies in theory?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
RT - Round Top Pattern RB - Round Bottom Pattern VT - V-Top VB - V-Bottom TC - Trend Continue ZB - Zero Line Bounce This is what they mean, but how to trade.... will have to wait for abhay to reveal.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Probably yes, I just do not get anytime to monitor other pairs but they move almost at similar times. Now there being a big gap in astro turning point, I am standing aside, no new trade until within 1 bar of the turning point. This is how you achieve your patience and will be able to see things clearly. This very thing has enabled me for the first time in trading career to have no loosing trade since mid Oct but that is manual trading. As soon as Expert Advisor is ready and tested, I am going to let that run most of the times.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Good stuff

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Ok, here is something to look out in another 4hrs.. There is another type of signal that I don't always enable as it reduces the profitability in autosignal strategy. Since there was a large gap, I checked this signal and it will appear at GMT+2 time of 22:00 hour that is in next 4 to 5 hours. It seems like this run UP may end around that time or that may be another turning point. So I will be ready for a trade around that time... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hello Abhay, I will look how momentum develops. 22:00 (GMT +2) looks like a possible end for an up move. We will see . Attached Image

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi Abhay, Attached is my chart which looks entirely different from the latest chart you posted. Any idea, what went wrong with mine? Thanks Roy M

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Nothing is wrong, I have enabled another type of Astro signal temporarily that is disabled by default Since there was a large gap in turning points and the move was good enough so I enabled that signal to check and it appears as magenta bars. The only reason for disabling this signal is that over longer term, AutoSignals profit goes down with that signal included but sometimes it is a good signal.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Thanks Abhay for the clarification. Roy

--- 帖子 #373 ---
As I had said, I will be watching this upcoming Turning Point (this is not enabled in released version as AutoSignals profit drops when this event is used everytime) It looks very good opportunity for 15-20 pips trade at least... I SOLD EUR some and will add more as it gets close or if the momentum stalls.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi abhay. I was wondering, does this indicator work on daily time frame?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Caution .! As the euro USD has broken daily downward Treandline. If it shoud hold to end of day 4 pm est...Good pips all

--- 帖子 #378 ---
The autosignals strategy has max stop of 55 pips or resistance from 3-5 bars before the turning point, if it is very close to that level then somewhere in between. Firesword, it will not work on Daily because the signals are short term,many signals would have happened when looked at daily timeframe so no utility..

No need for m1, you are most likely going to loose when you go so granular... I feel 1HR is sufficiently granular neither too small nor too large.. All movements are usually happening at 1HR timeframe from the perspective of Turning Points.

Abhay, The time stamp matches. deleted and copied it again. Same issue observed. Maybe the version 5 you attached in post 1 is not the latest ?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I observed that myself, but once you change the strategy =Manual or AutoSignals again then it comes back correct. I think what is happening is that the Objects from previous history remain and are conflicting. I will check the code, but for now everyone having the issue just overwrite or change the strategy parameter and then do Ok. It will come back correctly.

abhay, how to disable this blue line ? sorry,

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Thanks Gemini Man and Abhay, of course; .pdf version attached for the benefit of all.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Just go to 'colors' and choose 'None' Quite interested in your red spiky line - what is that?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Quixote, Actually i'm able to convert it to pdf version, but the problem is, same as your upload pdf, some pictures will be cut and can not be seen fullly, that's why i upload in the Word version, with the Webpage layout format (don not change to print page layout, you will get a cut pictures). anywy, tx.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
tx boxferret, it is Peak indicator - do not ask me to share here, as it is still in a test mode also.

Hello abhay: Congratulations on your EURUSD trade. Price is moving in your favor as you predicted. Can you explain how you trade high impact news events that occur at a turning point ? For example lets say price is moving up and is at a resistance level at the news and turning point time. So a reversal trade looks imminent. Would you wait until after the news has been reported for some period of time and then say go short on a trend line break or would you just place a short trade before the news event with a wide stop since you expect price to drop ? And is your trend forecast method astro based also ? Thanks Borg

--- 帖子 #433 ---
For High impact news, I think using AutoSignals is the best thing because in manual trade you may become hesitant to pull the trigger and get confused and may not have time to react quickly or put stops ... whereas AutoSignals (after Expert Advisor is released) can very well handle this and over last 5-6 months it has netted handsome profits, given that any automated method will loose some and you might be inclined to think that some trades you would have put differently but it is the overall game that matters... yes Trend Forecast is also Astro based...

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hello abhay: So it sounds like AutoSignals would take trades during high impact news events. But how wide would the stops be ? Thanks Borg

--- 帖子 #435 ---
If you see parameters of the indicator, you will see the Stoploss =55 pips but the actual stop can be less than this and that would depend on the Support/Resistance level that indicator calculates before taking the less. So before the high impact news if the range has been small then Stop will be tighter.. The key thing is to do some scrolling back and observe the Blue Line in lower panel to get an idea of how the small losses or the stops are hit and how the profit curve keeps on rising..

Hi guys, I just got this indi activated and want to give it a go. However there a little prob here... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Its seem like my vertical line colour is different from abhay chart. Also, there is missing vertical line compared to previous chart example post by abhay which i circle red. All in default setting. Although I change the "broker_gmt_time_offset" from 3 to 0 (my broker use GMT0), the line doesn't change. I'm hoping to get same line as everyone else so in future when we compare or discuss, we have same view. Hope someone can help me.. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
It is alrite, if you change a parameter config1=true then you will see the missing line. My chart has some additional events that are normally not enabled because they may reduce the profitability over longer period but many times they are quite good. Since in this period there was a huge gap, so I temporarily enabled and it worked very good. No need to change gmtoffset as it will automatically adjust for your broker. The parameter is in case it is not working and you want to override.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Abhay, Pls pardon my ignorance and appreciate if you can clarify what exactly is 'blue line' suppose to indicate. I.e. what is it intend to do and how to 'read' it ? Also, I checked few times but the auto signal mode is not giving the signal on a real time basis. The small arrows (signal) appear only after I restart the mt4 platform.. Cheers ! D

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Alright... seem i need to play a little with the setting... After i change config1=true, i got this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) All change to 1 colour which, is good for me. I view this vertical zone as same as our traditional support and resistance zone. Will play around with this zone for awhile then i post more what i think about this. Keep up the good work!!!

Hi Kubiasty, I've closed my sell with +80 pips. Btw can you share me your Turning Point setting? ok, Abhay thx

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #472 ---
ed, while all those candlestick patterns are good and valid many time, they all have same usual problem, if you consistently follow them then you end up loosing no matter which indicator you chose. That is why Turning Point indicator is used to filter all those non productive times out and we generally take the trade in 2 bars before turning point or within 3 bars, exception case 4 bars after turning point. Yes some moves outside of this range may look almost given but these are kind of traps that once you fall into then you don't know when to trade and when not to...

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hey Old Dog, Good to see you here my friend... If you're here, then I'm confident that abhay is on to something. Guys, Old dog know's his stuff and is an "Old dog" when it come's to crunching numbers, so we have someone amongst us who will be a a great contributer to this thread. Welcome m8. ;-)

Abhay, i noticed that the this event zones are repainting Today they looks different like yesterday Can you fix it? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #475 ---
That's right Kubiasty, me too, but times Friday corresponded perfectly .... I hope you help

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Kubiasty, I have figured out the issue, the automatic GMT offset does not work when the market is closed, because the clock is not moving so it gets an incorrect value. I am going to set a global variable fr GMT offset when market is moving, so that even market is off, it will know what was the value for your broker. So hopefully from next week things will be ok. In the meantime, if you want, set the automatic gmtoffset=false and then set the correct value of your broker's gmtoffset and it will show correct TP's Some very exciting improvements will come this week... just wait... :o)

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Could you explain how you determine these turning point areas?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
This is based on my discovery of a secret universal law of natural rythm, first mentioned by W.D.Gann. 1000's of researchers have been trying to decode it for last 70yrs, many claim to have decoded it, but I now feel none of them have really decoded it though they have used other parts of his sacred geometry techniques.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Abhay Thanks for the explanation and for sharing your knowledge and work...........

Hi, Kubiasty Do you manually draw the trend line? (green colour line)

My advise, just throw away your old indicators like those ... take it seriously... if you want to make money. Understand that the advantage with this indicator is that it is very accurate and a good signal may be there even if your other indicators are not giving signals. The way to trade this is use price action but throw away all those indicators... or better follow Automatic Signals. .

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Yes, Sir.And I do have 1 price action indicator but not attach in.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
New update of Turning Points indicator has been uploaded to 1st Post. (There is a new parameter, show_trendlines=true/false. This will automatically display trendlines near turning points and support resistance. There will continue to be improvement in these lines.) The AutoSignals strategy continues to perform extremely well, and alst 5 months profit potential = 1800 pips not counting last week's 300 pip trade...

Thank Abhay for update I still don't understand the autosignal. Is that the arrow show on chart?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Abhay, Thanks for the continuous updates. However one of the issues I have been mentioning right through out is still there : I.e. Auto signal on the live bar is not appearing even after the particular candle is closed. It always 'appear' when I restart the platform. For a layman it seem as if the calculations that are suppose to throw out the autosignal arrow is not happening 'real time' on a frequent basis. It reinitializes itself only when the platform is restarted (history gets updated). I have deleted all the past versions of the indicator and tried again. Still no luck ! Am I doing something wrong or is this the way its suppose to be. If it is, then how do one trade auto signals ? Cheers ! Darshana

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Abhay Please explain - from the auto signal at 10:00 there was a light blue line which you should place a buy if above. But from the breakout it should be a sell. Please explain the auto method as I am a bit confused. Many thanks Nads Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #495 ---
I noticed this too. Things change when you restart the platform...

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Lines used to change when it was not able to derive gmtoffset automatically for your broker. Now i have set a global variable that will store your broker's gmtoffset, and when you launch mt4, it will first try to get the value from that. So after the latest version (v6) lines should not change.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Autosignals - Arrows where a BUY or SELL trade would be taken by the autostrategy bulit-in Trendlines &amp;support / resistance - Some of this is used in AutoStrategy and these can help a manual trader to know trade levels The flags for Show Auto signals on chart &amp; show trendlines can be turned on or off for clarity.

for SELL trades, Stops are on candle close above those dashed support/resistance lines.. or follow the autosignal if it closes.. remember, turningpoint trade is valid only upto 3 bars from the line..

Kubiasty, see the comments and lines in white.. shows where a trade should be taken.

Oh ok.. I will try to test with any other indi for best confirmation and will give the result here

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Lex, I think there is a difference of 1 bar on your chart. Yes Lex, as monghan said, using only price action based confirmation (ie Break of Trendlines or support/resistance lines) will be enough to get good trades as these are not lagging and they will cover your breakouts as well as reversals. If there is any scope of improvement in trendlines drawing, then I will update it to make it better and better. Looking at the action it seems liek EURO is rising into Red bar, so if there is no momentum further and after Pink trendline appears, if price breaks below it and stoch is also high, then it will be a SELL opportunity. I will be off to bed so can't take that trade.

Hi abhay Pink line doesn't appear on its own, but only when I reload the template. I have the indicator set to 'Automatic' - Also, can you tell us what is the significance of the different color turning point lines. Some are a different thickness as well - does this mean the turning point is less defined? Does red mean 'important' and yellow or light blue mean 'less important'? Looks like a good SELL coming.....

kubiasty, there was no trendline because conditions did not meet. For trendline it needs a trend of atleast 3 to 4 bars. also if it is already in a trade from previous signal then may not draw the trendline or support/resistance lines.

This is what I was expecting that the trend may continue for 1st one or 2 turning points... So now likelihood of a SELL opportunity developing if momentum stalls completely or if stoch goes a little more higher Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #540 ---
After breakout of that trendline yellow, how much pips down we can expect, abhay? Should we enter now sell, or wait for confirmation after close below yellow trendline?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
That trendline I drew manually, I will fix the code so it draws on live bar... profit target usually depends on the movement speed but I expect atleast 15 pips, but if it does not go that much and stoch goes to bottom then I will take what I get

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Thanks abhay - just reloaded my template and got the pink trend line on the green turning bar (after the white &amp; blue bars) - looks like a SELL if it breaks.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
With this bar completed, stochs have gone up a bit more, I am ready to take some position now near 1.0895-1.897 and if it goes further up near completion of turning point, I will take more SELL if momentum is still slow..

Not yet, stochs are still high, it may take a little longer to get more profit... but getting that in this movement is ok.. better something.. :o)

--- 帖子 #522 ---
The 'bug' only relates to the live bar I think, which abhay will fix in a future update. The other trend lines default to 'highlighted', so pressing Delete will scrub them, if you saved your template in this state then your trend lines will not appear? Just a thought....

I would think it should be ok, but you never know it can retrace back up again or it may not, if it closes below trendline, then most likely as in the past it should offer more pips lower even if it retraces. But you should be on guard, either add more if it retraces and have eyes on stop

Looks ok for sell ? Closed below Pink SL above last high ?

you hesitate too much. there is never a 100% certainty, so build your criteria, watch previous trendlines. See how you would have traded them. My profit target changes based on time of day or the momentum in price movement. I also watch the stop areas, just in case..

--- 帖子 #572 ---
ok, failed this time, bad things happens.. looks like price going to 1.10

--- 帖子 #573 ---
To trade correct with this strategy, how much pips SL should be ??

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Normally I watch Support / Resistance lines (Green Dashed lines you see on the chart, or the starting point of new trendline if the trend line changes from pink to blue. Sometimes you have continuation of trend lines, like you may get 2 or 3 same color trendlines in succession, so I look for reverse color trendline.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Often this happens, when multiple Turning Point near by, one will hold the price or bounce it around and the next one will be the one... unless it breaks off the highs So it appears now the Green one is the turning point and price should turn down... Attached Image

Hi abhay, thank you very much for your nice indicator. I started playing with it and really like it so far. Unfortunately it does not show the turning points in instruments with high point values like the dax. I think it is because the rectangle height is 10000. Could you please change the rectangle height in the indicator to a higher value like 100000 or so that we could use your tool on all instruments. Thank you very much. xpie

Price is moving lower as expected into the upcoming timeframe.. watching it for a nice formation of short term low, then it may present the opportunity for a BUY for 15-20 pips as we are moving to that slow time of the day. My trend forecast is looking like low into Fed's announcement and shortly after the reaction is over, a rise higher will start inEURO so I am looking to buy all major dips in EURO near the turning points on the FED announcement day.

you need to be consistent in taking signals, if you take some and do not take some then most likely you will miss the winning ones and take losing trades. Just scroll back and practice and see how would you do if you consistently took the trades... or wait until the expert advisor is ready.. follow the profit line in the lower panel... it shows how the trades have performed..

how to trade the profit line Abhay? this my chart now, is it ok?

--- 帖子 #604 ---
see my comments on the chart. earlier candles were above Blue line, but when blue candle flipped to above the candle then it became a sell trade with stops on a candle close above blue line. It would have given 15-20 pip profit.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Good day Abhay how to read the Blue Line, when it ticks up or down is that when the trade would be taken with the EA, many thanks

--- 帖子 #606 ---
to avoid false tick ups and downs, I wait for a candle close above blue line for a BUY candle close below pink line for SELL but like in slow range unusual case, we saw candle were above blue line and then after a while blue line went above the candle, then it was like a SELL if blue line flips like that, that is in very less percentage cases..

--- 帖子 #607 ---
now we are seeing s possibility of candle close above the blue line (although we normally take the latest blue line..) and this being a GOLD color bar, there may be a possibility of price moving from here to the next bar, but if it remains a very slow movement then I will get out when Stochs are high..

Apparently it is a sell noe. Please confirm.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Normal rule is we look for candle close below the pink line or if blue line flips from below the candle to above the candle. But here I have already taken a SELL trade as the momentum has stalled and it is not able to break 1.1010 and I think it should easily give a good SELL profit before Fed announcement. Your chart looks slighty different in terms where pink line is, compare and if needed copy the turningpoints.ex4 from 1st post and reattach to the chart.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

may be it is due to display autosignals as well as trendlines are both set = true. attaching another copy of indicator to separate chart with autosignals may make it more clear.

Chart with Settings as follows Show_Signals on Chart = true show trendlines = false strategy = AutoSignals Also, is it possible to have the various lines on the chart without the three dots on the lines? It will be nice to have thickness and color of the signal arrows adjustable. The support resis thickness and color settings also dont seem to work. Thanks

Hi Abhay, You have mentioned about plans for an Expert Advisor. Any target date? Tks

--- 帖子 #629 ---
It is almost done, I am testing it... at this moment I am leaning to implement the strategy that is giving autosignals on the chart, trendline is good for manual traders as they can spot the momentum and couple of things when watching manually, but difficult to build some of those things like momentum in auto mode. So the strategy with combination of Turing Point and Macd, give nice overall profit with some small small losing trades.. For me it is ok with that strategy but I know many traders are impatient and cannot handle 3-5 small losing trades in succession, so trying to work on that...

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Great, looking forward to it. In the meanwhile wonder if it is possible to release an EA which takes trades based only on the signals / trend lines. You can perhaps restrict this EA to work only on Demo Accounts.

This TP is not easy. RSI tells me that it is time for a little up move, but because there are no reliable geocosmic events today and tomorrow it might be that we still have to follow the down trend, which would be in line with your general forecast. I stay short but I will set my stops a little bit tighter .

--- 帖子 #642 ---
It is always easy if you don't complicate things yourself. With this system trading has become so much easier. You just know the turning pint and you also know we watch trendline break or break of support or resistance lines, that is all it takes to trade. If you know the general scenario is down and uncomfortable to take the BUY trade then stand aside for the UP move to complete in the next turning point and then wait for the SELL opportunity.

I use TrueTL indicator also for trend lines. There was support at 1.0818 ish... yesterday also this was level of lot of back and forth, there was a risk it could have broken below, but when I saw it came back quickly above this level after going lower to 1.0810, I felt it is going to turn at this turning point and would go higher.. Colored lines are for different purpose, one day hopefully I will be able to classify them, until then all lines are turning points, GOLD bars are high energy points..

--- 帖子 #653 ---
looks like it is loosing momentum, will watch some more and if it can't break the high of 1.0859, then will SELL, as it may be completing the bounce into the turning point and may fall as it comes out of it.

Looks like astro points are randomly. Why to use trendlines, pitchofork trendlines, support / ressistances ? So astro need everything we know before ? Sometimes price on astro breakout, sometimes not, LIKE EVERYWHERE else.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Kubiasty, You have not understood the purpose of this... astro indicator gives you the reference in time, when to wait and to know when the energy of these timing events is going to play. since usually these timing events are pretty accurate to the bar but sometimes the effect is felt 1 or 2 bars after or 1 bar before. Also you don't know yet if it the force at the event is going to give a breakout or a reversal. Simply put, trading for last 10 years, it was very difficult to make profit consistently as I was always too early or too late in trade decision, not trading at the right time, lost entire capital many times over. Now since Mid Oct to Mid Dec, I have multiplied my capital to 150% gains already and in next 2 weeks should be able to cross 200%. I don't sweat now, I have survived all the big moves carnage as well, earlier I would always get caught on wrong side.. overall complete confidence my financial outlook has become so good...

Sometimes its changing direction of price, sometimes it doesnt and continue.. sometimes before astro event, sometimes after... randomly When i trade not using that ---&gt; sometimes price changes direction, sometimes it doesnt, sometimes continue, sometimes ranging markets, randomly.. any differences?

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Abhay has referred to the turning points lines as being energetic points.. not a prediction of which direction the market will go. Oftentimes it is a reversal, but not always. How many ways can a trend change direction? Let's see... up &gt;down down &gt;up sideways &gt; up sideways &gt; down down &gt; sideways up &gt; sideways Now, depending on what the market hours are, news events, etc., price action can be slow or fast. His advice to be patient and wait for price action to reveal itself by crossing a trendline is the best, and probably only way to trade with these turning points. W.D. Gann is quoted in an interview with The New York Herald Magazine, Jan 5, 1919, p 15 'An astronomer can predict to the minute when a eclipse is going to occur,' he said, but you would not consider him a prophet, would you? Of course not. He simply makes use of mathematics based on known laws of the movements of the planets in their orbits. I have found in my researches that the Chinese understood all those laws and computed the coming of eclipses thousands of years before the Egyptians and Chaldeans. It is marvelous the knowledge that these ancients had. In making my predictions I used geometry and mathematics just as an astronomer does, based on immutable laws which I have discovered. There is nothing supernatural or weird about it. Some weeks ago I read an interesting article on the failure of astrologers in their predictions regarding the war. 'Now there is a great deal in the vibrations of the planets, but to make accurate predictions the great law behind it all, which the ancients understood, but which they purposely refrained from putting in their books, as they wanted to keep the secret for themselves, must enter into the calculation. That is why astrology fails for nothing can be accurate that is not based on mathematics and so few astrologers are mathematicians. Gann told this interviewer that he had discovered the Law of Vibration through the way in which numbers and letters were written, not through astrology or the planets. Furthermore, Gann says here plainly that planetary calculations are not sufficient to predict the future; the great law behind it all the Law of Vibration must also enter into the calculation. In other words, something must be used in addition to astrology that is not astrology and that something is the Law of Vibration! Gann then adds that astrology fails, and why? Because nothing can be accurate that is not based on mathematics. Thus, Gann implies, the Law of Vibration the law that rules all things is a mathematical law. Here we have only to determine what mathematics are involved what Gann means by the term mathematics and we will be in a position to attempt to look at the markets as Gann himself looked at them. We will have begun to understand the Law of Vibration. Romeman has written a well researched and thoughtful look at Gann's Law of Vibration and is freely available as a pdf download here: THE LAW OF VIBRATION - Forex Factory

Why would sideways be a direction?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Could be a quiet time in the market, could be a consolidation period... in any event, it is a change of trend. Direction also involves time...Time continues to move forward but price is stalled... that is a direction.

I see.I got that wrong with trend changing "direction"

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Thanks for the heads up regarding the link... apparently the top half "The Law of Vibraton" worked and not the bottom half... so I edited that out... try it now. I am a student of Gann and there are many more knowledgeable practitioners than myself.... such as Abhay. I am here to learn from him. I have been actively posting in another Forex Factory Forum, Planetary Cycles and use both Timing Solution Software and Astrolog 5.4 to find Moon - planetary aspects that might be trigger points for price change. It is an ongoing "open source" experiment... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...08#post8654308 These points are not the same as Abhay's. I find Abhay's approach to be the most valuable and practical I have ever seen in various forums, including Forex Factory.

Gann is Totally and utterly correct, I have studied this full time now for about 9 years, Gann was also using mathematics and astrology together not in isolation. I have also rediscovered the work of Gann and simplified his astro work to show me exactly when and where a market might turn, coupled together with Ganns law of vibration that works if you understand how to use it and why you can accurately predict turns in the markets, price is time and time therefore is also price. If you can grasp this concept you will understand what Gann was up to. Gann was a genius, and he certainly knew how the markets worked.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hurst, I agree with you about Gann.......a genius. Having said that I have never been able to get my mind around his concepts strong enough to put a trading method together. I have read some of his works, but still the light is not bright enough for me to follow his path. I have read Tunnel Thru The Air, but again found nothing I could use. Not doubting the clues are there, but they escape me. Since you have been a student for nine years I would greatly appreciate you pointing me in a direction that might just enlighten me to the ways of Gann &amp; his methods. What path should I take? Many good trades to you my friend. ______________________________

--- 帖子 #684 ---
The last thing I want is to start a discussion on the merits of Gann but for all the newbies who like to believe in market secrets and discoveries, I would point out the following. Alexander Elder interviewed W.D. Gann’s son who was then an analyst for a Boston bank. “He told me that his famous father could not support his family by trading but earned his living by writing and selling instructional courses. When W.D. Gann died in the 1950s, his estate, including his house, was valued at slightly over $100,000". "The issue of W.D Gann fortune is a very controversial. Gann’s son John told anyone who asked that his father was a swindler and a fraud who made his money by charging thousands of dollars for trading seminars, and that rather than being left millions of dollars his family was left with a modest inheritance. Gann’s supporters point to the soured relationship mentioned above son as a reason for the statements he made. It could be easy to say John Gann had a bad relationship with is father that is why he rubbished his trading techniques. If there was a fortune even if John Gann was cut out of the will it would be logical John Gann and the rest of the family would take the matter to court. There is no evidence of any court cases over W.D. Gann’s estate. This indicates there must be some truth in what John Gann is saying. The estate of W.D Gann was modest and certainly not a fortune". Absolutely no independent verification exists to prove that Gann ever made a penny from trading. He might have been the greatest trader of all time but there is no evidence whatsoever to support that whereas there is quite a lot of proof that he made money from selling courses and books. Caveat emptor.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Generally Gann is not for newbies.That comes from the work involved to make any progress at all in this field.For a newbie it suffices to understand that there was someone once a time that made enough effort to understand how the markets work. It is personal choice whether you "believe" he was just a salesman of courses. You need to take up the study yourself to see whether there is merit to the ideas associated with the name. The courses to me for example are rubbish, maybe ten sentences in there are useful.My personal opinion is that the courses are nothing but a cheap version of the knowledge he truly had.There is also the problem of Gann choosing fancy names for his concepts which lead to all those fancy ideas floating around by people believing they understand Gann.Law of Vibration,4th dimension,Master Time Factor are confusing names for actually clear cut methods.The trouble is that it takes many many hours of precious life-time to understand these methods and hardly anybody is willing to throw that out to the public. Then there is also a rather strange aspect that comes with understanding of some of his methods in that they touch upon themes from religion and metaphysics,things you simply do not talk about.

I am incline to agree, but with the vale of secrecy surrounding his methods one has got to wonder. I have his book "Tunnel Thru The Air" &amp; have read it 5 times, but the light has still not come on for me &amp; his methods. If you are willing to point me in the right direction......the path to take...... I will travel there on my own. Not wanting a hand out, but just show me the path. I think there are many traders around the world that want to know more about Gann &amp; his methods, but have given up. I have not given up, but it is not what I focus on as I use to. Early on in my quest for more Gann knowledge I discovered Gann Square of Nine. Simplistic in design &amp; to use. Today I used it to take 30 pips from that move down on EUR/USD just before the New Year holiday close. I want, but I could write a page on how to use Gann Square of Nine. Most traders are probably well aware of the Square of Nine &amp; its use. My question is why if the Square of Nine is that simplistic.........why are Gann's other methods so cloaked in mystery? Have used the Square of Nine for over 2 years &amp; it works. Not all the time, but it works. Not meaning to rant, but just sharing my views. Any light you are willing to shed on MR. Gann &amp; his methods would be most appreciate by me &amp; maybe others too. Happy New Year to you &amp; all who visit this thread.

Happy new year to mr abhay and all here.

Happy New Year, What you have to do with this book is look at the dates and times referenced and sit with an ephemeris and a SQ9 chart While he laces the book with numerous references to “wheels within wheels,” possibly a loose allusion to the “clothed in veiled language” spiral of the Square-of-9, he discusses none of the tools required for cracking this book’s secret. Without an application of the Square, its angles and the era’s cotton chart, it is impossible to analyze Gordon’s trades. It appears that a great deal of the material Gann said is in the book is missing. He does send this signal on page 78, where, in capital font, he boldly tells the reader that “it is not my aim to explain the cause of cycles.” He then adds, rather patronizingly, that “the general public is not yet ready for it and probably would not understand or believe it if I explained it.” To put the puzzle together, we must refer to Gann’s Master Commodities Course, as well as plot a chart of Gordon’s trades. On page 331 of the Master Commodities Course, Gann vaguely refers to the Square, saying: It is “important because nine digits are used for measuring everything. If we divide 360 degrees by nine, we get 40, which measures 40 degrees, 40 days, 40 weeks and 40 months, and shows why bottoms often come out on angles measuring one-ninth of the circle. In Chapters 5A and 5B of the course, Gann elaborates upon the strength of the 180- and 360-degree angles, saying: “the 360-degree angle is strong because it ends the circle and returns to the beginning degree, and because it is opposite the 180-degree — the angle that equals half of the circle. As summer becomes hot and winter reaches frigid temperature extremes, 182 days later, so too does stock market action reach volatile extremes.” This is as far as Gann had ever gone to show the connection between the Square-of-9 and its 180- and 360-degree angles. He had most certainly extrapolated from stories in the Bible that the seven years of famine followed by another seven years of plenty, and the 40 nights and 40 days of the Great Flood, indicate a 360-degree revolution of time. Eager to find a calendar-calculator capable of measuring time, and track the angular positions of spans, Gann turned to astrology where he discovered the zodiac’s cosmic clock — his Square’s prototype. It was humanity’s first instrument designed to track the movements of the sun, moon and the arrangement of planets that ancient civilizations used for maritime navigation at night and in projecting a river’s ebb and flow. Gann’s version of the zodiac navigates the ups and downs of markets. My advice is pull all the dates out and look at what was happening astronomically on those dates, also look at the cycles he talks about. He made it hard because he wanted the people that read it to be his intellectual equal. Get the charts from that period and draw all the references he made on them. Then you can see why he made them.

Abhay : Thank you for sharing the knowledge and your time.

Hi abhay thankyou for your thread,are your Astro Turning Points based on the same concepts as Steve Copan's Market Matrix? I notice he mentions Gann in his introductory video Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Steve Copan Market matrix is a complete scam, it does not work, the turning points are miles out and he then uses elliot waves and fib number counting as an overlay. Pure and absolute crap, you will spend hour drawing turning points and coloured lines on your chart only to wonder do you ignore weekends or include them. I personally know that in his video course he used data that was already known to draw his delta points, knowing where the market was going to turn give you a great ability to plot your data points using what ever bullshit reason you want to draw the dots in the right place. I actually bought the course as did many others a scam of the highest order. Avoid if possible. Other scammers are Larry Pesavento having paid him to teach me his method, I got email after email with his patterns on, each one failed. I asked him how he made money, his reply was he was busy promoting his book in China and did not have time to answer my mail. I told him his patterns were a crock of shit and he could remove me from his mailing list. Larry talks about embracing your losing trades, you certainly will if you follow his method. Robert Minor, a good frend of Pesavento so you can guess whats coming next, having met traders that used his method and really studied it, not one I know is trading now, in fact all the guys I know that used his methods are working, because yes you guessed it its another crock of shite. My new years mission is to keep the new traders away from the parasites that keep turning out methods that do not work so they can finance their lives. Not one of these clowns will show you a real trading account, because they don't make money trading.

Hi Abhay; spent quite a bit of time with Hinduism in the form of the "Hare Krishna" movement - and learned about and studied Vedic astrology. Are you using Vedic or western - just curious. For me it is not safe to use gmail, so I sent you a private message. The reason is that I am in the us - and everything is tracked by google; I don't want them to know anything unnecessary. (; My two accounts are unauthorized to use the indicator. Now back to reading. Subscribed.

Here is an excellent discussion about Gann's "Square of 9" on Mattei's blog, "Gann Master Trader"... he is Romanian so you'll have to let Google translate it for you... http://gannmasterforex.blogspot.com/...tul-lui-9.html "For those passionate about Gann analysis techniques, there is no secret that he used and developed mathematical techniques, astronomical, astrological, numerological as well. Probably one of the most difficult concepts to understand in Gann techniques is the "vibration"." A good demonstration of using the square for EUR/USD....

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Happy New Year &amp; Thank You. I will look into what you have shared. It is obvious you had spent many hours in the study of Gann. Yes the trading arena is full of scam artist seeking to extract money from those trying to learn. I stopped buying into their lies long ago. Square of Nine is part of my trading &amp; it works. Thank you for sharing your knowledge. I will always be interested in learning more about Gann &amp; his ways. If you know of anything else I can dig into to learn more..............feel free to share it. _______________________________

--- 帖子 #699 ---
His example is great and I would advise you all to study it, I am also going to see how it can be used to extract the correct vibration because I personally think this was one of Ganns most powerful tools, this tool actually gives you all the answers, if you have the correct mindset you will experiment with it, and you will start to see the rules that the markets follow.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
All that type of movements are useless if your desire is to touch the deeper essence of spirituality... What I do is neither of those streams of astrology. I have been meditating for long time. As a result of that one day was sitting with my mind clear without clutter and I was looking at something and just then a thought/idea crossed my mind and that opened the door...

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Thank you for you contribution to our quest to learn more about Gann.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
What a great answer... This gets to the heart of this entire enterprise... trading, ultimately, is very personal and must spring from deep personal experience and conviction. That is the true Holy Grail.

We are in the Turning Point region now, if the momentum stalls and trendline breaks or stochs begin to turn up, we can have a BUY trade, target could depend on the Stochs or speed of movement.. Attached Image

Hi I got a problem when refreshing the chart, it change positions on the turning points. It happen when the indi has been on for a long time. When I refresh and its totally different?

--- 帖子 #707 ---
You need to refresh once every week as MT4 has space only for few future days, so system cannot properly display the bars if indicator not refreshed every week also make sure you always copy the latest file

--- 帖子 #708 ---
ok thanks

I got 12 pips on the way to the daily pivot at 1.0881 but the obvious entry looks to have been the open after the pink trendline at 1.0931 and that would have made for 50 pips to the daily pivot...but its still going.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Thanks abhay for the much work. This version 7 has only one colour(BLUE) in the turning point? And did i hear you say this version will show the arrows on real time live charts? I just want to confirm these two things from you.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
One of my questions answered on next candle after post.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
You have probably set the parameter for show_astro_in_background=true, if you want to see original then set this = false. Yes arrows and trendlines are realtime.

Good day Abhay. In my last post on friday last week, i spotted out a life signal forming and formed. But i noticed i can't find the signal arrows again even after refreshing. The red circle below was the signal point on friday now no more. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Often we are impulsively driven by the mental condition to trade in big moves and make big money.. but if one can use Turning Points indicator to trade just in the quite times when there is some movement in the price , then good profit can be made.. Just an e.g in 2 turning points, made 15pips on SELL and going for 20 pips on the BUY. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #727 ---
More than target achieved @1.0866

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Hello Abhay, not shure if I get that first trade: the trend was sort of down, then only 1 candle went up just before that green zone so I (in my ignorance) would be looking for a long, not a short; can you explain a little more?

--- 帖子 #729 ---
I saw price was not near breaking resistance of 1.0870-1.0875'ish and when there was a down candle on Green color bar, I knew there was a potential for some 10-15 pips, so I took the trade but did not close on next. I waited till it was close to next RED turning point, there STOCHS were also low and price was not breaking below 1.0835 - 1.0840, so I took my 15pips and went BUY and took another 20 pips...

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi Abhai, thanks for sharing this knowledge and strategies, I found interesting Astro-based forex. I've updtated the 2 files within Mt4 folders and everything seems work fine, except for bars who are not Blue but they kept many colors of previous version. I noticed also a blue arrow under the candle, please how we can use it? (please watch image). About Future Times, I didn't get their use, it's just an estimate of how strong the turning point is going to be at that particular time or there's something else? Thanks for replying and I wish you a succesful trading!

Hi Abhay - what are those interesting charts, I've never seen those before. Also how do we use the JMA Slope indicator?

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Those are from the trend forecasting I do. It is about 70-80% accurate and gives me an idea of what is about to happen next, lot of times I consider that as well in choosing what to do at the Turning Points. Knowing this trend, I sold this morning at 1.0920 (actually I put a limit order before going to bed..).

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Thanks for the reply...... Are those trend forecasting charts something we need? Will you make them available or is Astro TP enough? Thanks again for sharing all this.

Hi Abhay, that's my chart look like right now just wait for the bounce

--- 帖子 #740 ---
It seems it could be just a temporary bounce and it will probably go lower next week as well. I covered my SELL and then did a small BUY SOLD that too. Watching now..

--- 帖子 #741 ---
As was forcasted that a DOWN move was expected into the event today, we got a very nice DOWN move and it began the bounce right after the event. Made some very good pips both DOWN &amp; then BUY and again SELL. Also it shows, how the EUR turned at both the recent turning points... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Abhay, I've uploaded a screen shot of EUR after v8 update. There are some differences between your chart and the one I uploaded. Other than the difference in TP zones, the new trend line in my version does not trace the lows of the bars as closely as yours. Is anyone else having some differences too? Thank you for the TP.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Only blue bars here, even looks better... The trendlines however look fine! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Blue looks nice too. But you can see the trendline is not the same as Abhay's trendline. There is an extra line in his chart. Just wondering how to align. It's not a problem.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Actually, it is displaying exactly as mine. My screenshot was posted when the bar was developing and system will recalculate Big TrendLines on every new bar... So when you posted the chart the new big trendline was touching a point a little lower..

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Hi Abhay I am really exited about your strategy, like to congrats you with your programming skills I have read all of the 38 pages, perhaps I missed something to be honest, I want to figure out the background of the strategy as well how to use all the indicators correctly you provide so great-full. Perhaps you can give me a hint what I should focus most to begin with? best rainer

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Grasp the tips given in the manual. Don't look for trade on every turning point bar. separate the trades in slow time period and news impacted fast moving time periods. In slow moving zones, profit targets will be small 10-20 pips and you take the trend at turning point when the momentum exhausts and stochs are high and watching the trendlines on the chart. I take some trades when I know price is not under any news impact and it is not going anywhere just bouncing around. I wait for turning point and if stochs are high supported by trendlines, I go for 10-15 or 20 pips depening on the motion in price. I have some longer trades that are also guided by my forecast over 2-3 days out and when good price at a good turning point supported by trendlines...

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hi Abhay, The last trend line to print on my chart was on January 27... Is there a way to fix that? Thanks, Jerry

--- 帖子 #757 ---
i want this short trendlines alone in ex4 file. can you able to provide abay ji because when ever i apply this turning point my mt4 gets struck so i am asking this help

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Jerry, probably you have not updated the indicator. Please copy the file from the first post and let me know if you still have the issue. If you have already copied the latest file then check the parameter Show_Big_Trendlines=true or not

--- 帖子 #759 ---
do you have many charts open in the same platform and may be any other very heavy indicators? In my view big trendlines will be very very helpful in good trades but if you want to turn them off then set parameter Show_Big_Trendlines =false

--- 帖子 #760 ---
yes i am using many charts with various indicators.. but i understood and i will try as you said.. really thankyou

Hi Abhay since I was not able to watch your strategy all the time I like to ask you about the future times on the chats. Are those times which predict their will be an other TL to watch?

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Yes the times displayed in right corner are where the colored bars appear. So the time alue gives you an idea in how many hours it is coming and the colored bar lets you to see the price action happening around that zone..

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Did you close your MT4 and restart after updating the file? if still the message does not go then remove and reattach the indicator to the chart.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Conclusion of a very good trade from last nite, when EURUSD breached the pink trend line at the turning point. The newly added bigger term trendlines kept the trade nicely into the SELL, closed it at the next turning point. This is the power of the Turning Point indicator combined with automatically drawn trend lines..

abhay, Would you check your PM box please.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Nothing there yet.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
The chart looks different now, but at the turning point you marked with the first red arrow, at the time there was also a big trend line going up that had not yet been broken. How could you sell into a big trend line that is going up?

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Ok, 2 things here. First, screenshot 2-3 bars right into the turning point after making the high. You will see there formed a downward sloping trendline as well, always on longer term this indicator shows sort of a wedge and generally price breakout out of these wedge lines is also a good trade. So this line was my Stop guidance and with the current short term trendline direction UP, I did not have a big profit taarget in mind initially. Also see another chart below... Attached Image (click to enlarge) From my forecast chart, I had some idea that there will be a down move and if not today then by next week I will most likely see good move down. So one trade I took 25-30 pip profit 2 times yesterday and some trade I kept for longer move.. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now, you also see it points to lower prices until next week, so I am not loading up on BUY yet, it might or it may not but I am cautious and will play small moves unless price looks quite attractive..

--- 帖子 #770 ---
@ Ahbay - does market need to be open for TurningPoint.ex4 to work? I gotten it installed but it isnt showing up

--- 帖子 #771 ---
It will show even when market closed. Common mistakes i have noticed, some folks did not have correct files copied like astro.csv was 0kb in some users and in others DLL was not enabled from Tools &gt;&gt; Expert Advisors. It is better to cpy the files after closing MT4 or reattach the indicator after copying the files.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
astro.csv was 0kb yes this did happen to me, did not take good attention..

Hi, I apologize for the late response but I just got busy last few days but I hope the trendlines were helpful in keeping you in the right side of the trade.

I agree with you Mr Abhay, though it turned at this point giving some 30pips move, I see the sell trend continuing .

--- 帖子 #789 ---
You guys went wrong. EU went up hehe

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Guy, Fx is not about who is right or wrong. The market can be on a sell trend (which you can call right) but some people can still make profit buying. It is all about making profit. I am just saying I am still on a sell trade which was signaled early hours of today and I still expect it to drop despite the buy pull back. I will not take that buy cos it is against the trend I see hence too risky for me. That the buy worked does not mean we were wrong , it was too risky to take for me. That is what I meant. Anyway my chart shows my trades so you understand what am saying better. You are right I know but am not wrong, lets just make money. That's all​

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Rightly said, it is not about right or being wrong. No one can always be on right side. But I wanted to limit the risk until the trade is clear. Keep watching the combination of trendline and turning point..

Abhay, I wish you the best with your new release. I have still been unable to get a successful download from page one. Any chance everything can be put into a ex.4 file only?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
I can help you install through screenshare utility.. Once I release new version then contact me.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
I am sorry, but I can not make this work on my platform, what I doing wrong

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Same thing for me as well. I even had someone else give it a go on my computer &amp; they failed too. Maybe the updated version coming out soon will fix the problem.

Everyone must copy the 2 files from the archive TurningPoints.ex4 in indicator &amp; Astro.csv in Files directory, otherwise it will not work. =================================== =================================== ====================== ========================== Indicator has been updated on 2/25/2016 , Please copy TurningPoints.ex4 &amp; Astro.csv from 1st Post. If you learn it's mechanics then it is almost like cash machine. You can enable these trendlines by setting new parameter Show_Big_Trendlines=true/false

--- 帖子 #805 ---
there is someone who use biblical number to get turning points, and he said that after february, things will get worsen. it is interesting.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
thx. abhay I put it on my desk, now lets go from page 1 to see what to look

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Hi abhay Does this method just work to EURUSD,what about other pair,as GBPCAD, USDJPY, These 3 pairs Volatility are not the same, so I think they affected should not be the same Which Planets Effect them,how to know Which Planets Effect them? Regards.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
THanks for your work. Does this work long term or does it need to continue being updated??

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Hello, I change the broker and the turning point dose not work, I am now on fxdd is problem with broker or dont now some thing

--- 帖子 #810 ---
It is because most likely you did not copy other library files needed to the FXDD folder. Please install all the files in the archive in 1st post to FXDD folder and it will owkr after restarting MT4

--- 帖子 #811 ---
thx. now is ok but the blue line is not moving, because of that I change the broker, I can not move it

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hi abhay Indi say Turning Points Invalid account. if you can help me active your indi Best Regards.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Did you download and copy all files from the archive in 1st post ? Do it again and it should work.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hi abhay I use the Latest version TurningPoints(9).zip ，No other files used I have do it,but the EA say Turning Points Invalid account，it seem work but the EA always say Turning Points Invalid account Best Regards

--- 帖子 #815 ---
You need to set 'true' for SHow_signals_on_chart

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Abhay did you figured out what everyone colors means ?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
I think we should handle day night saving time by changing the set_gmt_offset_automatically to false and set the broker_gmt_offset manually for day light saving time as it is applied to Europe now (I think). Also, I have reported through email, it repaints gold color to grey green sometimes. I saw someone experienced this, anyone has any clue on this please.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Although very hard to believe that Astrology has any link to forex but from a very experienced trader i heard that " Mercury is the key". So i will have to respect the view. Man is awesome.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Indicator does not repaint, it calculates one time only in the week, in some cases due to change of parameter or if the value of broker's gmt value is not available in the weekend then overlap happens which causes the change of color. For this I started using the global variable so we don't have to be dependent on broker's value during the weekend.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
It still looks like color doesnt matter and time... Sometimes there are moves on GOLD sometimes not.. Its like LONDON session open, sometimes big moves, sometimes now. Like on NY session too. Sometimes big moves sometimes not. Sometimes big moves on GOLD area, sometimes not.. Sometimes breaks the price on LO, NY, sometimes not.. I still dont know how to use it..

very very precise in determining the point of entry nice

really nice system, subscribed. One question, what software you use to generate file Astro.csv?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
ummo do you know how to use this indicator ??

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Hi Abhay, Got a message on the astro indicator, stating that this indicator will expire on the 29th of April 2016. What should I do??

--- 帖子 #826 ---
This is a very good indicator. Is it really expiring?

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Do yo u guys earn with this indicator ? So what is ur method ??

--- 帖子 #828 ---
@Kubiasty Hello there.. I have been trying to understand abhays indicator since the time he has shared it to the community. The key is to do the normal trading with what ever method you are comfortable , the only difference is to be ready around the turning points. Either a breakout happens or a reversal. Also be mindful of trading around the news times. I mainly trade London market and new york market.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Also please read the first few pages. this where the main idea is discussed. Try it in demo.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
aha okay thanks

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Hi Abhay, You are probably busy, but is the update coming soon? The trendlines (pink and blue) have been disappearing since yesterday. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Please copy TurningPoints.ex4 again from the update in the first post. A new Turning Point model has been included and now that is the default. To see the original model, attach the indicator on another copy of the chart and set parameter, config_1=true (for new model) Attached Image (click to enlarge) config_1=false (for original model) Attached Image (click to enlarge) =================================== =================================== ========================= Indicator has been updated on 5/2/2016 , Please copy TurningPoints.ex4 again from 1st Post, now the Trendlines are much improved and will show on live bar.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
hi is there a trick to this as my platform freezes when i try to load turning points ?

--- 帖子 #834 ---
If you have copied all files in the archive then there should be not a problem. Usually people having problem miss out on copying the data file Astro.csv and then just wait for 20-30 sec and it loads up after that load there is not much calculation.

EURUSD is right above the thick support line. Good signal on break of that line, So need to be careful there. Right now I am playing small based on down sloping resistance line

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hi Abhay, I've loaded everything onto my mt4 platform, but I'm not getting the coloured boxes, just all in blue? Also my vertical boxes are not the same as yours and when I change the GMT offset it doesn't make any difference to the vertical boxes? thanks in advanced.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=405That's the rest of the system, please don't share

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Show what you are getting. GMT is calculated automatically. To override you will need to set the parameter to=false, but there is no need to do that. Make sure you have copied the astro.csv also in proper directory.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Any ideas to connect this Astro indicator with other one?? How to use it... ?

--- 帖子 #842 ---
These are 2 models and your trading style will determine your preference. Just like are you interested in quick 5-8 pips scalp moves or more like 10-20 pips moves? Looking at the chart, there were so many trading opportunities, so clearly identified. You have to know the time period we are in, which time periods can give what kind of moves and go for it accordingly. Repeat the mantra many times to yourself, Not to be too greedy..

Thanks for your work Abhay! Just installed it and will try it, why not ...

--- 帖子 #844 ---
if 10 pips tp so how much pips sl ? you wait for candle close after breakout?

--- 帖子 #845 ---
I have been following this thread from the very beginning. I have not contributed so far because I must say I never believed in Astro trading nor in Gann. I am still not convinced although I must say that Abhay turning points are sometimes really uncanny and make me think. That said, the trendlines in the system are great. Just take the break of the TLs and you should do OK. If you are uncomfortable with that, use your favourite indicator to filter the breaks. However if you do that, you must be aware that all indicators either lag or repaint so your best bet is to use the PA around the break. Two questions to Abhay 1. Just as a matter of interest, any reason why the turning point lines do not show up in the Dow or Dax? They show in all the major pairs but not the indices. The times show up so there is no problem but the lines do not. 2. How do you get the total profit P/L shown on your chart above Lastly but most importantly a very big thanks to Abhay from me for all his generous work and incredible patience in answering the same questions over and over again.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Works for me?

Interesting. Maybe the problem is with the broker feed. Vielen Dank

No problem. Mhh...I downloaded the newest version from 02. May (Also didn't had to activate it etc.) maybe try that if you have an older version...

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Your last cross mark is not vey good, because you see price is in sideways expansion, means too long in sideways upward movement compared to the previous swing down leg, which mostly has chances of getting broken. Since we are already in a SELL trade from that bounce off the downsloping trend line, I am not fine tuning it at the moment..

--- 帖子 #855 ---
So how my trendlines should looks like there ?

--- 帖子 #869 ---
read all thread, finally (i've postponed for some time to take a deeper dive in) Abhay, you're a courageous man, to get your astro work into the open hats off to you you are very generous i study astro + gann, for long time, but didn't managed to put together a strategy based on astro anyway I am convinced about the Law, I see it at work all the time, although in bits, like small fishes, which slip through my fingers clearly, i need a higher vibration, and a clearer mind, to understand more anyway I have some questions and some remarks: * i've downloaded, installed, everything appears ok, rectangles are shown ok but i get TurningPoints EURUSD,H1: Invalid Account....... =&gt; is it ok? i am on the default MT4 installation, demo mode, and i want to practice on it if I'm still required to PM you anything, tell what should i send about the MT4 default demo simply the account written in title bar? * timezone question is DST automatically calculated? (I presume so) I am in GMT+2 zone, but now is still DST, so actually it's GMT+3 on my charts now * i guess it would be useful to add a label, under future times, with timezone info something like: "calculated times in GMT+2 (DST)" or some calculation involving current time, for user to check easily this will solve the recurrent question in this thread "is my timezone ok?" * i didn't hear anyone suggesting something about rectangles and colors wouldn't they be ok also in indicator's own window below the price chart? to have a cleaner price chart? if not possible or desired, then color tweaking would also help for clarity dimmer colors (on black background would make rectangles less "flashy") or did you experiment with rectangles with limited height? drawn only in the price area =&gt; cleaner price chart * Thank you, and I appreciate your work and generosity!

--- 帖子 #870 ---
urningPoints EURUSD,H1: Invalid Account....... =&gt; is it ok? Do you see colored lines ? If yes, then you can ignore the message. I will try to look into it to suppress the message in future updates. * timezone question I am in GMT+2 zone, but now is still DST, so actually it's GMT+3 on my charts now The timezone adjustment and calculation is automatic. So no need to worry, it adjust according to broker's time.. * i didn't hear anyone suggesting something about rectangles and colors wouldn't they be ok also in indicator's own window below the price chart? to have a cleaner price chart? Separate indicator window can be used to display but I found it is not very visually effective. Many people want to use other indicators on top so they prefer seperate window, but my suggestion is to open another chart to load other indicators that you want to see.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
The indicator works fine, no issue there. So no need to send stuff, ok One idea crossed my mind today, un-filled rectangles? this could be a nice parameter, filled or unfilled rectangles but i checked mql4 reference, and there's no fill as in mql5 myeah

Try to remove the indicator from the chart showing blue lines and then reattach and let me know if you still see blue?

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Add Stochs and RSI as well to the template. If there is not much momentum then these indicators will help you to know the situation. remember yo have to know what environment are you in, is the market moving right now or dead when you are about to place the trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Abhay, your hard work shared to help traders is well appreciated.I want to come on board again on this indicator.You might not remember me,but perhaps mt-yooo group might help to. The indicator really help to anticipates turning points in the market primarily on EURUSD but found to be true on other currency pairs.I am going to download again and post here so others can benefit. Good job Abhay, thank you very much! Plenty pips to all

Hello FlowCycler... I will be interested in your insights. I look forward to your posts.

Thank you for this exceptional Indicator! Besides of the people here asking pesky questions and the other ones making fun of the method, there are some people that cherish your work, such as myself. Will there be an 2018 update?

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Dear Traders, The update to the indicator has been uploaded in TurningPoints(12).zip in the 1st post of the thread. If you already have all the files then you may copy just 2 files: TurningPoints.ex4 --&gt; in indicator folder Astro.csv --&gt; in MQL/files folder Restart your MT4. If you have any issues then you may contact me. I attach to 4H, 1H, 15min timeframe. 1H shows very short term trend lines also,you will find them useful. ========================================================================================================= PS: Sometimes I am not getting notifications of members posts so I am unable to reply.

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Very unique and interesting approach to trading. I will give it a try

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Thanks Abhay... I am glad to see this thread continue... Merry Christmas and Happy New Year... Jerry

--- 帖子 #891 ---
is this normal?? the turning point blue line just stay at 0 ... or anything wrong with the system??kindly let me know.. thanks.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
I don't understand what you mean by Blue Line stay at 0, but this is developed mainly for H1 chart, but I attach it to M15 &amp; M5 also to get the trendlines. Turning Points are most effective on H1, M15

--- 帖子 #893 ---
based on wat you see,admin.. do you think my turning point gets operated correctly? that blue line.. even i post it on higher time frame.. it doesnt seem to to work..wat i am concern is the blue line..

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Ahh, I think I know what blue line you are talking about. That is in the lower window?? Actually I was trying to build a trading strategy based on these turning points and trend lines but did not get time to finish it. So you may ignore the lower window and shring the lower window. All the Turning pints and trend line directions are available in the main chart.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
how to see the turning point in the main chart? seems all are trendlines..

Firstly, thank you for the update Abhay. Gordontan, you should use this indicator on m15/H1 to see the big picture. Use the basic settings of the indicator (press reset; right button in your screenshot). Config 2 &amp; 3 have to be disabled in order to see the turning points. Just use the basic setting in m15/H1 and you'll be fine.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
hi warren.. it seems to have many colours in the main chart.. very confusing.. can you try to show me yours?

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Your chart is showing the correct points. This is how it's supposed to look. Not every point causes a turn. These points can potentially cause a turn. You need to use them together with the inbuilt trendlines and the other tools. Read the pdf file in the first post by Abhay.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
alright warren.. thanks for your reply.

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Great thread! Subscribed here

Hi Abhay, Something funny happens in your spreadsheet. on 2018.07.13 06:00 column B jumps from 327.1364 to 110.6931 the same number in column D. Which means you probably have the same planets in 2 columns. Was this intentional?

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Good day , i am just into astro trading, anf i saw something by abhay and i downloaded it but the turning points on the main window is not showing at all, pls help me with this

--- 帖子 #906 ---
this is the material but the turning point is not showing

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Same for me, turning points not showing

--- 帖子 #908 ---
what do you mean turning points are not showing. May be you missed some step in installing, the files need to be copied correctly to the correct folders. If the .csv file is not copied then it won't be able to display lines. Check Journal tab, do you see any errors there ?

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Turning Points indicator continues to perform every single day. Just watch small trend lines for the break of the direction around the colored lines..

--- 帖子 #910 ---
TurningPoints(12) (1).zip on post 906 (couple of posts above) is the latest that I have found, I have a dll file that I place into libraries, I have an excel file but I do not have csv file

--- 帖子 #911 ---
that excel file has a .csv extension Astro.csv

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Thanks is working now¡¡¡¡ Kind regards

--- 帖子 #913 ---
See the last chart I posted, how the price was turning on the bar and now see how it did...

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Im going to read the thread again during ths weekend and on monday I will place the theory to test

--- 帖子 #915 ---
remember, I use mostly on 1hr chart and sometimes 15min, but not lower than that. TIP: Very important tip, set up a chart with only this template and if you want to use other indicators then open a separate chart so not to confuse what it is showing. Most important learn to pay attention to short pink and blue trendlines. They will tell you where is the price moving. Because sometimes there is a continuation if there is a compression but most other times price will turn

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Thank you very much abhay , very grateful

--- 帖子 #917 ---
it works everyday... just watch small trendline break around the turning point lines... learn to identify a consolidation pattern or a reversal pattern..

--- 帖子 #918 ---
another day of turning points working...

--- 帖子 #919 ---
another day and price again reacts exactly on the turning point..

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Hi Abhay.... here's how that turn looked on the 1 min chart for the EUR/USD using spectrum module in Timing Solution...

--- 帖子 #921 ---
first of all, I am trading only ES futures and options or options on stocks. So I am not monitoring EURUSD. Secondly, all that kind of modelling has to be changed every week or ever couple of week, it looks good for demonstration but not worth a cent for trading. I am really a trader first and cannot take anything that does not have a system around that model. My system just works, no change and with a full system built by way of mini trendlines around the turning point. I have not touched this system in last 3 years and it works every single day..

--- 帖子 #922 ---
See again how these mini trend lines give you nice trades around turning points. So easy just follow this around the turning point

--- 帖子 #923 ---
So you saw the above chart how price was turning around last Blue Turning Point and now see how the break of mini trend lines gave trades on both sides of Turning Point

--- 帖子 #924 ---
One more day, same simple principle... Look for Turning Point and watch break of mini trend line or a congestion zone breakout for accelaration in previous direction..

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Abhay, I hope all is well with you. Have made several attempts to download Turning Points indicator. Once the download of all files is completed the indicator never shows on the chart, but when I look in the objects section of MT4 chart several of the components of the indicator are showing such as calci &amp; viselebtl along with the short trend lines. Would you describe for me &amp; others step by step how you download the file &amp; are all of the components needed such as the MACD. Sorry to trouble you, but I have exhausted much efforts &amp; all are failing. Thank you for you time &amp; guidance.

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Ace, Did you place the extra files in their proper places? Image 1: swisseph.mqh into the "Include" folder Image 2: swedll32.dll into the "Libraries" folder Image 3: Astro Excel file into "Files" folder If that still doesn't work, try another MT4 demo broker to try the system on... -Jerry

Yes I am, but I did not find anything interesting..

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Hi Abhay, After following Jvevins precise instructions I have Turning Points loaded &amp; running. I have a request if I might. Can you code the indicator so as the colors of the TL's can be changed to different colors &amp; the color change will hold once the change is made? I use only white charts &amp; this change would greatly aid me in being able to continue to use the white chart background. Now a question....what time frames are recommended for Turning Points? Thank you for sharing your works. Best of trades to you &amp; to Jnevins.

--- 帖子 #937 ---
it works absolutely fine on white charts. I also use white charts.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Abhay, I have it loaded on a white chart, but was hoping to brighten the line colors, but I will use it as is. Thank you again for sharing. Always interest in what other traders are coding.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Hi Abhay, After having turning Points up &amp; running for a few day I have some questions. 1. Is it common for the indicator to say DN &amp; price is clearly moving UP &amp; there are times when UP is showing &amp; price is moving DOWN. 2. What time frame do you suggest? Thank you for your response.

Hi Abhay, Thank you for sharing your system. I am new to this way of trading. Have downloaded all latest files from post #1 and all files double checked are in the correct folders. Default settings and checked "Allow DLL Imports" in Common. Tried putting TurningPoints indicator on EU H1 chart and MT4 locks up. I opened Astro.csv and the entries stop at 8/17/2018. Is this the reason MT4 locks up? 49320 2019.08.17 23:00100.6319274.1202128.6216107.08793.9336208.0702 How are updates done to the Astro.csv data? What else should I try? Thanks for your help.

same here, have downloaded on two different brokers and get it only done when I use 4H charts very odd, if I change to 1H charts freeze and i have do force closing It worked for me not long ago, but I had to delete the broker, downloaded new once, to no avail

All, I found that the program stopped working because it had run out of the data for future periods in Astro.csv file in MQL\Files directory. I have uploaded the .Zip again in the 1st post of the thread and also updated TurningPoints.ex4 , please download from there or I am also attaching to this post. Abhay

Hi Abhay, Thanks for the updated file... I reinstalled everything into the proper folders on 2 platforms and when I attach the Turning Points indicator to a 1 hr chart, the inputs show up, then nothing... the open chart does not have the indicator.... Can you help? Thanks Jerry

Here is the screen shot as I drag the indi to the 1 hr chart... Then nothing.... the indicator does not load on the chart...

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Did you enable Allow DLL? It would not attach to the chart when there is some error. So check journal tab also and let me know what is the error you see there. did you download the latest version of the indicator file that I attached yesterday?

@abhay: Thank you for programing such a great indicator. On the weekend I was reading through the thread and tried to learn as much as possible. So far I made 3 successful trades with TP=10 Pips and 1 losser this morning. How would you trade these trades? Going long or short and why? First trade was a losser I was expecting to break and going down!? Stoch was showing down!? Second possible trade I did not trade cause of fear! :-( But I would also expect to go short!?

--- 帖子 #916 ---
I am short but I am very cautious because I trade against the trend, I am sure with the trend more success will be achieved

The Blue Line "turning line" does not work despite following all instruction and enabling DLL. I had started from page 1. "Future Time" works but Blue Line "turning Line" does not work. I appreciate if any good samaritan here that can help.
