NO Trolling & No Other Indicators Please & Thanks!

Spend time to go through the thread and you will understand the system.

We are trading SWING POINTS (123 ideal Reversal Candle System) and SUPPORT & RESISTANCE(Best Buy/Best Sell Levels). Please see attached indicators with Suggested Settings.

THE SWING POINT
This system is used for trading Reversals. The indicator shows the trigger line at which we take our entries. Sometimes price may go to the high of the Bearish Swing Point, if Sellers want to sell higher and Buyers will go down to the low of the Bullish Swing Point, if Buyers want to buy lower. Therefore, your stop loss must be placed above/below the Swing Point. Please note some improvements have been made on the system to filter fakeouts as much as possible. Please download the indicator attached. Study the ideal setup described in this post to get an understanding of how the system works.

BEST BUY & SELL LEVELS

This system is mainly used for trend continuation on entries, once price stalls above a Best Buy or Sell Line we BUY, AND below a Best Buy or Sell Line, we SELL. Please download the indicator below. This post will be further updated with the recommended settings. To get an overview of this aspect of the Strategy, please read posts #441 onwards. These lines simply represent Support & Resistance Levels. Our approach is to BUY SUPPORT & SELL RESISTANCE. When Support turns Resistance we sell. When Resistance turns support, we buy.

FACTSThe market TRENDS more than it BENDS/REVERSES. Knowing targeted reversal points Helps for Reversal or Continuation Decisions. If I miss a strong reversal I can always get in on a LOWER TIME FRAME REVERSAL or A REVERSAL REJECTION SETUP. We will take trades Mainly on H4, H12 & Daily Charts or according to the Daily Chart trend on lower timeframes such as H1. If you trade on H1 take smaller profit. The market reverses a trend through a 'U-Turn' formation called a SWING HIGH or SWING LOW. This system pre-emptively identifies the 'TARGET' reversal point to help us trade a REVERSE or CONTINUATION. Five bars make up a Swing High or Swing Low. At ALL times BAR#3 is the "peak" bar. Scenarios #1 described below, are our ideal trade.

NB: I also watch the US30 and the USDX to get confirmation on USDJPY direction, and general sentiment on the dollar. A good resource for more information.

THE LONG(BUY) TRADE

ideal BUY SCENARIO#1Market is tending downwards (at least for 3 days). Downtrend - Creating lower highs and lower lows. The LAST BAR (BAR#3) closes with two bars having higher lows on its LEFT BAR#3 closes ABOVE the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) OR above the OPEN PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY). Open a BUY TRADE OR BUY LIMIT at BAR#1's OPEN (if BAR#1 has a bullish body) or at the CLOSE (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) Stop should be placed at 50 pips or 15 pips below BAR#2's Low, whichever is greater. If BAR#1 has a lower low than BAR#2, we use BAR#1's Low - 15pips for our stop. The average Take Profit is 100-200 PIPS. Swingers may hold longer. Assess the Win Probability.  The WIN probability is higher when BAR#3 closes ABOVE Both "the" BAR#1 & BAR#2 prices. The WIN probability is higher when BAR#3 closes ABOVE Both "the" BAR#1 & BAR#2 prices AND the BAR#1 and BAR#2 prices are close to or at the same level. The above is important because rejection of reversals are common at the BAR#1 PRICE  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

OTHER BUY SCENARIOS

These will occur when BAR#4 OR BAR #5 close ABOVE 'the' BAR#1 & BAR#2 Prices. The same rules apply for taking the trade as outlined in BUY Scenario#1

THE SHORT(SELL) TRADE

ideal SELL SCENARIO#1 Market is tending upwards (at least for 3 days).Uptrend - Creating Higher highs and higher lows.  The LAST BAR (BAR#3) closes with two bars having lower high on its LEFT BAR#3 closes below the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY) OR below the OPEN PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY). Open a SELL TRADE OR SELL LIMIT at BAR#1's OPEN (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) or at the CLOSE (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY) Stop should be placed at 50 pips or 15 pips above BAR#2's high, whichever is greater. If BAR#1 has a higher high than BAR#2, we use BAR#1's High + 15pips for our stop. The average Take Profit is 100-200 PIPS. Swingers may hold longer. Assess the Win Probability.  The WIN probability is higher when BAR#3 closes BELOW Both "the" BAR#1 & BAR#2 prices. The WIN probability is higher when BAR#3 closes BELOW Both "the" BAR#1 & BAR#2 prices AND the BAR#1 and BAR#2 prices are close to or at the same level. The above is important because rejection of reversals are common at the BAR#1 PRICE
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

OTHER SELL SCENARIOS

These will occur when BAR#4 OR BAR #5 close BELOW 'the' BAR#1 & BAR#2 Prices. The same rules apply for taking the trade as outlined in SELL Scenario#1

BUYING & SELLING REJECTION LEVELS

These are important to look at because the first sign BUYERS are exhausted is that there is resistance against every opportunity to continue to higher prices and the first sign that SELLERS are exhausted is that there is resistance against every opportunity to drive prices lower.

Where do we find these levels?

Buying Rejection levels are found at the HIGHEST BULLISH CLOSE PRICE of a Swing Low.

Selling Rejection levels are found at the LOWEST BEARISH CLOSE PRICE of a Swing high.

NOTES & TIPSKeep Take Profit at 100 pips for counter trend setups. If price is failing at bar #1's price, the trend will continue. If you are in a short/sell trade and price keeps failing (not able to close below) at the close price of the Lowest Bearish Close Price of the Swing High Structure, the market could be looking to go bullish, protect your trade or take profits. Otherwise, stronger selling ahead. If you are in a long/buy trade and price keeps failing (not able to close above) at the close price of the Highest Bullish Close Price of the Swing Low Structure, the market could be looking to go bearish, protect your trade or take profits. Otherwise, stronger buying ahead.

Usdcad short trade for +200pips

--- 帖子 #3 ---
seems to be a nice&simple&clear strategy. congratulation!

1) have you tried it also with h4 or h1 timeframe?

2) the volume at the open of a tradingday is often low, especially when the brokers open time is before japanese trading session.

have you tried to get signals (or better hints) from the daily chart, but trade them later with a h4 or h1 chart?

for example: UC (post#2) gives you a daily short signal. now you switch to a lower timeframe and look for a short trade setup on h4 or h1?

3) how long is your experience with this strategy?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi birdland,

Yes it works very well on H4 as well, however I take mainly daily chart setups that will more likely give a good swing trade for the week. Its typically pre-empting a fractal formation which leads to strong reversal. I have been trading fractals for as long as I have been trading but this approach over the past year.

I do switch to lower timeframes such as H4 to help confirm and improve entries.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I may reverse long on this trade, as the dollar index is still very bullish and the h12 chart has a bullish setup in play. Will see what happens at the h1 close at 1.2873

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hello simon,

I see you have some arrows/dots on your screen shots, are they indicators at work?

If so, can you kindly share and explain.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi Rafaz1,

They are just Fractals which form once a reversal is confirmed.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Very clean and easy to follow system. Thanks for sharing.

Which pairs have you tried this on? Any idea what percentage of winners with 1:2 and 1:4 R:R?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thank you Yalgaar!

I trade EURUSD, USDJPY, NZDUSD,XAUUSD & USDCAD.

I have never measured the win rate, however it works pretty well for me.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Gold H1 and USDX H1 Looking great as USDCAD Responds. GOLD chart below:

Same for EURUSD & NZDUSD H1.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
USDCAD H4 looking to setup in direction of our daily chart trade. Will short here again with confirmation.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I have closed my USDCAD trades and am preparing to go long. Price fell into critically daily lows and still unable to break. Also H4 bullish setup is now confirmed.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thanks for sharing! How do u see usd/jpy mate?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Short Gold, H1 setup in favor of Daily trend. This was a rejection of a bullish reversal so bears continue.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Long USDCAD. H4 Rejected daily sell, and postured to follow current trend...upwards.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Short EURUSD H1 rejection in favor of the DAILY TREND.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Long USDJPY H1 reversal rejection in favor of Daily Chart trend.

These all moved so quickly. I hope what i have posted gives you good idea of the strategy.

Craziness approaching EURUSD's 1.2000. All out with profit...but this is why I love DAILY CHART SETUPS.

Hi Simoneg, thank you for you knowledge

the pattern is good here ?

thx

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I'm a little bit confused, for sell trade:

"2. The LAST BAR (BAR 3) closes with two bars with lower highs on its LEFT"

I think Bar 2 has higher highs than Bar 1 in your picture depicting the sell trade?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Yes js497...that was a good setup

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi sailorvt,

The most important thing is for BAR 3 to have a higher high than that of Bars 1 & 2. It doesn't matter if BAR 2's high is higher than BAR 1's high.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Sorry js497...though that trade worked out, it took more than three steps, which can work as well.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hey again everyone.

USDCAD H4 Setting up a good strong sell confirming yesterday's DAILY short. We wait for H4 bar close. Additionally, the dollar index is showing signs of weakness.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi Simoneg,

Thanks for sharing your strategy, how long you have been doing this one?
I live in EST zone and D candle closes at 5.00pm, and New candle would
Show at 8.00pm if I am not mistaken( correct me if wrong).  As soon as I see
New candle(#4), should I apply the method what you mentioned in post# 1.
Plz advise.  thanks,

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi Simoneg can you explain whats the wrong with this setup ....as per your statergy we want to buy at 4th candle but its hit SL

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi loveandpeace,

I have been trading this approach for a little over 1 year now. Yes, the daily close is 5:00pm EST. Yes your entry would be on Bar#4 or the bar that takes you to Bar#1's trade price.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
While we note that not all trades will win, in this particular case I would not have taken this setup as the market just bought back up to a huge sell setup from Feb 15th on your chart.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Short trades running and we are back at the bottom of the range hoping for a strong break south.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
No peace ahead of NFP it seems...out again at bottom of range with profits.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
NZDUSD H4 rejected upward reversal. Short taken. Sticking with the already decided...trade the trend.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks for posting your strategy, Simoneg. You stated that you've been trading this way for at least a year and making profits which is great. I plan to follow this thread and trade this way. The rules are simple to understand. I've tried using indicators to trade but it hasn't work out for me the same way it has for other people, so trading with just the candles seems interesting.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thank you numbrcrunchr! Price tells it all! I'm not an indicator or EA trader either. Get comfortable with spotting and taking the trades oh H1/H4 first and then move up if you like.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Simon,

Whick broker do you use? Is it swap free and comm free?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Simon

This system is reversal or trend continution ?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Why sell? Becouse candle3 have lower low than candle1 and price cant close above close candle1?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
now i am a bit confused. thought first to me it seemed clear, but will need to follow more time and examples to understand the pattern.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi yumnyap. I use Pepperstone. No their not swap and comm free.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi atbin,

It's a reversal system, however when reversal levels fail we trade the continuation.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Correct atbin!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Your system like 3 drive in price action .

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi atbin, I'm not so sure. But if that's the best way for you to understand it that's fine. I'm sitting out today. Generally don't trade on Wednesdays as market usually looks to confirm direction or is just plain wacky on Wednesdays.

All pairs also stuck between reversal and continuation levels so...scalplers' day for now.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi Simoneg,

Thanks for your reply,  could you plz explain the following,

“ or the bar that takes you to Bar#1's trade price “

--- 帖子 #46 ---
In this example the market was not trending upwards for atleast 3 days, which is a requirement in your strategy. How come you took this trade?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi loveandpeace,

Sometimes when a reversal setup develops, Bar#3 closes far above or below bar #1's reversal price, hence we have to wait for a retracement. So in cases like this, you wouldn't be able to enter immediately after bar#3 closes.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi kafeldom,

The essence of a reversal trade is that there is first an established trend, then it weakens, then we trade in the opposite direction. So if we are looking at a daily chart to determine whether a trend is established, then we need to see at least three bars trending in the same direction. The same principle may be applied to lower timeframes.

For a continuation trade, we do not need to check to see if a trend is established...it is already the fact. So once a reversal fails price will most likely continue in the established direction.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Dear Simon

Can drow your system in paint? Pls

I cant understand some part of your system.

Hi everyone,

I will be doing some updates to my 1st post to address some of the questions that you have.

Not sure if you trade USDCHF but it has had a great up trend, perhaps it can be an example of where to enter?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #53 ---
hi.

thanks for sharing.

i read your topic but i have a little problem about your #2 clause.can you explain more about it with a picture.

thanks.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi atbin

The 1st image is correct!

Sorry Erebus, i just saw your post. i pic my entries mostly between 7am and 2pm EST . Can't deal with losing sleep for london.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi everyone,

NZDUSD DAILY is now at the Bar#1 Reversal price. For price to reverse, the day has to close above here. Will see how lower timeframes are reacting to this price make trade decision

--- 帖子 #57 ---
GOLD again approaching BAR#1's reversal price. It failed to reverse there yesterday and is again approaching today. Will see how lower timeframes react to make decision during today.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
USDJPY sitting right on daily Bar#1 reversal price. Watching over the next hour for further confirmations on trade direction. I am taking an aggressive assumption that the trend will continue from here and buy. Since this daily bar has all day to decide on breaking the trend. Lower timeframes will confirm.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Nice idea, keep up simom

--- 帖子 #60 ---
EURUSD H12 at the moment has decided short (continuation) at the BAR#1 reversal price. Waiting for a pullback to this area on lower timeframes before taking short.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I am long the USDCAD. Chart below shows two bearish reversal setups, at the same price, being rejected twice. Additionally, we still have a bullish dollar index.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Based on previous charts and H4 closes. I am short the EURUSD, NZDUSD, GOLD and long USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Current picture on the US30 H12 CHART.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
from your examples we just need to define a "1-2-3 Bar" pattern?

here NU, are both 1-2-3 Bars and closelines (orange and mangenta) valid?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hey birdland,

Your purple 123 would not be correct because Bar#3 must have the lowest low.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
So i closed my "assumed" long trade on USDJPY -29pips. Didn't wait on a confirmation for this one.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
i see,

so bar#3 is more important then bar#2?

bar#2 can be an inside bar, green or red?

thx for answer!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Correct birdland!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Is it okay if I manually backtest this strategy and post my results here? If not np. Thanks for your response!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Certainly kafeldom. Just try to apply the principles correctly. Good to snap each trade we can see that you did.

US30 has bought 400+ points. Dollar strength.

hi please make a indicator for find 123 bar

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Ashwani, You can for your purposes, however I do not trade indicators.

Looks like NZDUSD has a setup for today

shall we put SL below today's candle?

And tp 200 pips or opposite setup?

Thanks in advance

Hi rookie14,

We don't until the daily bar closes. H4 shows possibility, but needs to stay above.

Alrighty!!

Thank you

Hi kafeldom,

No it doesn't have to be. What we are comparing is the trigger price on Bar#1 with the close price on Bar#2

--- 帖子 #82 ---
On your first chart (first post), you say "Bar #3 closes above bar #1's CLOSE PRICE". If that's the case, according to your rule #3, the candle must have a bearish body. To me, Bar #3's body is bullish. So do you think your Rule #3 definitions for both Buy and Sell setups are correct (Close - Bearish Body for buy and Close - Bullish Body for sell)?

Regards,

Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Nothing wrong here according to what you have learned to this point kafeldom. 1st trade won, second trade lost.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
A typical example why this is not always the case:

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Everyone, I am trying to update bit by bit, between trading and family. I crave your patience and understanding.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
As you can see both trades lost though, the red -50 means I lost 50 pips and it hit SL. I will need to do more backtesting. (I really appreciate your rapid responses)

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thanks for quick response. Then maybe you need to restate your Rule #3.

Regards,

Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Sorry I didn't realize that, may have misread your chart...and your timeframe is?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Daily like you said.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Brother,

Which pair is it

Thanks

R

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I think you misunderstand the suggestion - I wasn't looking for a real time trade entry

Only to use the daily chart to review where the entries would be

I think the confusing part of Post #1 is that although there are Buy and Sell examples given...

in the criteria for each, there are 2 scenarios mentioned, whether the 3-candle is bearish or bullish, so 2 more charts are needed.

Anyway, examining the closing price in relationship to previous bars price, either highs or close, is excellent method of evaluating the probability of trend direction

That's all you need for an edge.

Hey rookie14, its sister not brother. Pair is USDCAD

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Sorry I misunderstood your question Erebus. I am still updating post #1 as its easier than looking through thread for trade examples. I will keep updating as time permits, mostly over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Alrighty Sis

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thanks, one thing that needs to be fixed, this line -

3. Bar 3 closes above the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR 1 (if it has a BEARISH BODY) OR above the OPEN PRICE OF BAR 1 (if it has a BULLISH BODY).

The " it " can possibly mean, Bar 1 or Bar 3 has the Bearish or Bullish Body, know what I mean?

Even move the statement, like this:

3. a) Bar 3, if it has a BEARISH BODY, closes above the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR 1

b) Bar 3, if it has a BULLISH BODY, closes above the OPEN PRICE OF BAR 1

Definitely need a picture of both of those setups, thanks

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thank you for that contribution Erebus! Will work on it.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
For example, reading the step by step instructions, I got this ???

Thanks

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Ok, let me go back over post #1, revise and welcome feedback from yourself and anyone else following.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Here is another question, how important is the "lower highs on the left" ?

Really, sometimes there are "stop hunts" which spike the price up, pin bars come to mind

That is actually a good thing by the way, but if you mean Bar 2 has a lower high than Bar 1, that what is needs to say

There can only be 1 lower high to the left when looking at 3 bars.

And # 4 confuses me to no end, why is the entry in relationship to Bar 1 ???

Is that a missprint? Should be today's bar looks to me or I am missing something?

The numbers on chart are the STEPS, not the Candles number.

This would have been an easy setup and profitable with little risk, so I'm not hounding you for no reason

It looks great, thanks for sharing, will check more pairs now!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi rookie14,

No, that system describes failure at swing highs and lows

--- 帖子 #102 ---
so if i am correct, we are in the "buy zone" with NU?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi Erebus,

If you choose to number your bars in a different way for you to better understand that is fine, however the principles should remain the same.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi birdland,

Yes it is. I did not take this buy as I did not anticipate a reversal just before NFP. We may however see that today or maybe the setup will fail. Its NFP Friday!

So all trades from yesterday are still in play...at least ahead of NFP

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Rule three of the buy setup states:

“3. Bar 3 closes above the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR 1 (if it has a BEARISH BODY”

By this logic isn’t this a false signal?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi everyone,

Out of all trades ahead of NFP. Happy trading to you all and have a great weekend! I will provide further updates over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi kafeldom,

Why would you want to take a reversal signal on the EVE before NFP? Who would do that?

EA traders, if you are looking for an EA that will generate gold for you. You won't find it, and if you do, I will stop doing all that I now do, click autotrade and go to the beach everyday.

Traders, trading is a business. It requires work. Every serious trader educates/informs him/her self in such a way that will allow for high probability trades = earn money. Even a serious gambler spends time informing him/her self and assesses when NOT to take a risk.

An EA cannot examine market sentiment across related pairs or (for the most part), choose which setups NOT to take, or cut losses if it thinks the trade isN't working out, or take profit if it thinks the market has peaked.

Trading is NOT a simple business. You have to take time to learn and understand OR you will give away all your money.

I have not shared a work in progress. I have been sharing how I analyse and trade. I don't take every setup. If other variables outside of the rules are off, I sit on the sidelines and wait.

This is NOT and EA system folks. YOU WILL FAIL AT THIS! You have to think! You have to work! Then come back tomorrow and do the same.

I will do my best to articulate the system in an improved post#1 to bring clarity, and continue to welcome your feedback and questions that will help to achieve that end.

Bless.

So sorry...I somehow missed your post.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
An EA can do everything a human brain can do!  As a matter of fact it can do it much quicker and much accurately than any human mind can!

But usually the challenge is EAs do only and only what they are told to do. That said it is not easy job to explain the EA about all complex Market Sentiments and so EAs end up with limitations.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi everyone,

I have updated POST#1 to the best of my ability. I only need to add some trade continuation scenarios. I will make every effort to get that done this weekend. Hope the picture will be much clearer for everyone following now.

Hi simoneg

You seem to have a very interesting thread going. I had read your thread before and didn't clearly understand it and was waiting for some clarifications. Now that this thread has matured and after reading various posts and your updates, I think I almost understand most part of it. Thanks for sharing this. If you don't mind I still have gaps in my understand so if you don't mind to respond to my comments below to your points on Post # 1 , I will really appreciate it and I am sure it will help other members too.

Wish you all the best on this thread and on your trading.

THE LONG(BUY) TRADE

BUY SCENARIO#1 Market is tending downwards (at least for 3 days). Can you please define what Market trending downwards mean to you? I ask because this could mean different things to different people.  The LAST BAR (BAR#3) closes with two bars having higher lows on its LEFT. I believe I understand this clearly. Just for confirmation can you tell if my statement to describe this is also accurate? "The low of last bar3 is lower than lows of both bar2 and bar1" BAR#3 closes ABOVE the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) OR above the OPEN PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY).  Open a BUY TRADE OR BUY LIMIT at BAR#1's OPEN (if BAR#1 has a bullish body) or at the CLOSE (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) Stop should be placed at 50 pips or 15 pips below BAR#2's Low, whichever is greater. If BAR#1 has a lower low than BAR#2, we use BAR#1's Low - 15pips for our stop. The average Take Profit is 100-200 PIPS. Swingers may hold longer. Assess the Win Probability.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thank you yalgaar!

I will address your 1st question in post #1. Also, you are correct in your interpretation on the second point.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Cheers!!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Can I summarize as below?

In a downtrend, if a bar (Signal bar) has a higher close w.r.t two bars on its left, we buy at the break of  signal bar's close.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
thank you simoneg!

now its much more clear to me and i learn to understand and see the "pattern" in practice...excellent, i like it.

just a little to change from the #1 page (sell scenario):

it should read : "high probability trade...Bar#3 closed below the closed price of Bar#2..."

thx, very inspiring thread!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi Shiva,

It would be an incomplete statement according to the strategy, because if one of those two bars has a bullish body, its the open price that signal bar needs to close above.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Thank you birdland! I will make the correction.

I am happy to learn that the update has made a positive difference for you.

Hi simoneg, thanks for sharing. You said,
However your Buy Scenario#1  example is not.

You said "Market is tending upwards (at least for 3 days)", But in your sell scenario#1 its not trending up before the candle 1. Please clarify. Thanks!

Hi mario777,

Are you sure? Please look back especially at the BUY SCENARIO. For the SELL SCENARIO, the trend was already down followed by a sell setup. That is a good thing as the setup is in favor of the prevailing trend.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
thanks for sharing this elegant idea...i decided to follow this method for the coming month and master it on demo account.

looks promising

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Dear Sr

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi there,

If price is unable to close below bar#1's "close price" in this case, we are likely looking at a rejection of selling for continued buying. At this point though, USDCAD is in a range and may go up or down.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
my first idea is a short UJ on the H1 chart:

1) daily chart has a 123 pattern

2) H1 just stopped on the sell line AND made a bearish candle

so i see good chances for a short

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Is this valid since Bar 3 did not close below the close of bar?1.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi everyone,

Pairs seem to be interested in continuing their primary trends.

Bullish 123 on USDJPY H4, H12. Daily also pushed up strongly above the lowest bearish close in the Swing High.

Bearish 123 on NZDUSD H4 & H12 , GOLD H4 & H12 also just sold off previous bearish daily 123

EURUSD long gone

USDCAD still in range

Awaiting further confirmation

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Long Gold. H12 shows bullish 123 in play and bearish 123 rejected round about the same price.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
USDJPY Now prepping a short setup on the H1 to confirm daily setup. Will short on confirmation at bar close.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Dear Sr

You see photo

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi there,

You are not wrong. Just that because that setup was on Friday, I chose to await confirmation. Actually now looking at the H1 Bullish 123, though below the trigger price, may follow through on that buy setup.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Dear

1- EU H1, Can we buy?

2- My server time is UTC-4. Do i change server time? What Do you use server time?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
NZDUSD H1 wait buy

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi my time is UTC-4. I placed a buy at Bar#1 price and am now watching the next two hours to see where its headed as we are below the daily LONG setup price.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Good One. I bought this as well based on the daily and h12 bullish setups

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Current picture on Dollar index H12

Hit top of channel, heading back down to bearish 123 levels.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
the NU H1 BAR#3 is not lower than BAR#2. of course trade is working, but did you see this?

fully understand the concept of confirming signal on lower timeframes!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
no, H1 trade was not valid.

it was just an idea, but simone showed us how to do it correct.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Yes birdland, however if you look at OTHER BUY SCENARIOS you will see that it was a valid trade.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Nice one birdland. That H1 Bar showed weakness at our price level.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
ok i understand. so the pinbar was just a first sign of probabilities for a short are rising...

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Exactly!

Right now its my up time so I'm on the charts, I'm EST. When I go overnight I check in every 4 hours or so.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
ok, i never thought about interrupting my sleep to check trades. interesting.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
H4 UJ short setup too...right?

Hahaha...well if you care about your money you better!

Checking in a bit.

Correct birdland!

Position added on Gold Long Trade.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
really nice!

i would like to follow more but today i am off, because my trading day is during european session ending after london close...

read you tomorrow;-)

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Ok birdland...have a good one!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Took my profits on all trades. Will see what tomorrow brings.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
good morning,

so TP 100-200 pips means you are heading for a swing for 200 pips and in between you are trading?

or have you seen signs of exhaustion?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi birland,

Remember that all of our trades yesterday were not directly from the daily chart setup area. And even at yesterday's daily close price failed below those levels signifying weakness or exhaustion. So it was better to take profit on those trades as you can see.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
thx simoneg,

everything you say is very clear for me. the managing "in between" the trades is the discretionary part, which seperates success and failure.

i closed my UJ short trade today (a bit late after your words) for +30 pips. thx.

(dont worry, everything is my responsibility AND during learning periods i trade only microlots)

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Good trade! Yes, management is just as important as entry.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
for the statistic:

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Great thread simoneg! Seems that we need telegram chat so we can post signals in realtime.What you think?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Thanks ficibald!

Maybe someone else can cheer that, but I can't at all. I have work otherwise and manage my baby girl. That would be too much for me.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
not a good idea, have done and see this kind of "signal services" too often...

people get lazy after time and make others responsible for their decisions.

here a long trade i took with EJ. its a cross, so i dont know the outcome

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Long Gold, bullish H12 123, Daily Bearish 123 being rejected.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I don't see that setup on my charts birdland, is it h1?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Got it...EJ yes, thought it was EU.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Great looking trade birdland. Daily at the lowest bearish close of that Mar 27th swing high and can reject selling here.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Carefully watching the USDCAD & Gold right now

--- 帖子 #176 ---
USDCAD daily short i guess?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
So this is what I'm watching on the USDCAD. On the daily, price is at a strong BUYING REJECTION ZONE, this is the highest bullish close price on the March 11th Swing low, highlighted on the left of the chart.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Also the H1 is rejecting buying in the same area, with the same type of a setup.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Let's see how h4/h1 closes.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
USDJPY is already Daily bearish 123 sell price at 109.32. Now we have a H4 123 and Buying Rejection being attempted on the last H4 Swing Low. Let's wait.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
interesting what you are looking for.

with EJ daily i was looking for this zone (open and low of lowest bar from last swing, daily):

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Yes birdland, the lowest bearish close price of the swing high, is very important to watch and vice versa for Swing lows.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
No confirmation here. Swing low has a higher bullish close.

Planning a short on USDHPY here.

GJ H1

--- 帖子 #184 ---
GU H1 looks double promising for buy:

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Sorry I tuned out for a bit. Looks good birdland & 6677028. Nice when the setups agree with what other pairs are saying.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
you dont need to say sorry

like you said, also UJ H1 is turning short for a good signal, right on the daily trigger line.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yes birdland, I'm already in based on my previous charts. Also USDCAD still rejecting buying at BUYING REJECTION LEVELS. Last H1 close looking very good too

--- 帖子 #188 ---
GU, NU, AU, UJ and UC in line!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Indeed birdland.

USDCAD now prepping H4 123, as well. Already in from previous charts. Will only seek to add to positions from here on.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
out with the first (GU) at "trading the buff"- resistance for +60 pips

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Nice birdland...own it and make it happen.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
thx, its real fun and i like it!

closed both (UJ short and EJ long) with nice profits, because i want peace with my family;-)

read you tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hahaha...most important. Awesome. Have a great one birdland!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Gold now has a bullish 123 on the H4. Adding to my longs here.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
USDCAD now has a bearish 123 on the H4 right at the Daily and H1 BUYING REJECTION LEVELS.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hello boss,

Sorry to look retarded, but not quite sure that I fully understood the rules of the system... for example this trade, I clearly can see some sort of rejection by just looking at the wicks + Resistance level on higher TF, but applying the rules:

- Market is tending upwards (at least for 3 days).Uptrend - Creating Higher highs and higher lows.

USDCAD was ranging on H4 for the last days, I assume here you talk about Daily?

- The LAST BAR (BAR#3) closes with two bars having lower high on its LEFT
Bar 3 here is closing having a bar that made a higher high (did a breakout of the channel) and a small bearish one

BAR#3 closes below the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY) OR below the OPEN PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY).

This, yes

Also I have a couple of questions

You use this system for reversals or also for trend continuation?

You enter before candle close?

How do you filter "bad setups"?

Is this setup right for example? When would you enter?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
No bosses around here, everyone trading and sharing.

1st Question - yes was referring the daily chart.

Not understanding what you are asking in your second point/question

3rd Question - Yes the system is used for both reversal and continuation

4th Question - No I never enter before the candle close. I will get confirmation on other timeframes and keep taking trades in the direction on h4, h12, daily and so on

5th Question - I filter by looking at what the other pairs are doing. What the market sentiment is across Gold, USDX and US30. Looking at Higher timeframes

6th Question - The setup in your chart seems Ok. I cannot tell if I would enter as I would have needed the opportunity to do my checks as stated in my response to Question 5.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hello Simoneg,

Question 2 I was referring that the 2 left candles should be doing lower highs, but in the trade I quoted from you, you have a big bullish + bearish, so Im not sure that this rule was met.

Thanks for taking your time to answer, will be trading this method starting from today,  let's see if I can find good setups

Kind Regards,

Jimm

Hi Jimm,

I may have missed the trade you are referencing. Kindly post again so I can respond accordingly. thanks!

--- 帖子 #201 ---
observation on H4 in european session: GU, EU, AU and NU have a 123 pattern long

and GU H4 had a nice rejection to the trigger line.

i just catched some UC shorts right around the trigger line H4.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
EU Looking sexy to me... also this rejection is at RN Level...

I don't know if I should wait for more retracement + engulfing on the previous candles or just jump in after candle close in long direction.

Any thoughts?

Hope the trades I'm posting are meeting conditions...

EURNZD... Rejection from Round level, bottom reached and new higher high using the support of previous lower low...

Hey everyone,

I'm off today, just a quick peek in. Gold h12 is at SELLING REJECTION LEVEL, usdcad h4 has bearish 123, usdjpy h4 just reach BUYING REJECTION LEVEL. Interestingly organised, so your setups have good support...even the sexy ones

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hey again everyone,

Thought you all may find this useful. USDX showing signs of very strong selling ahead. H4 chart below. Daily BUYING REJECTION LEVEL was hit at 92.25

Hi J1mm,

The setup you identified here was good, however, your entry would have been as I have below. Your trade just kicked off. Hope you took it.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
hi simoneg.

been following your thread for a few days.

nice strategy!

but i seems can't find the exact definition of BUYING/SELLING REJECTION LEVEL.

i've read this post, but still don't understand. why that bullish candle, not the highest bullish candle of march 16th?

cheers

--- 帖子 #209 ---
i agree, this is also not 100% clear for me, but i hope simoneg will show some more examples in the future and then it will be clear.

today i am off due to holidays here...

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi everyone,

I did provide some information in the TIPS on the rejection levels, cant recall if it was explicit, however I will definitely improve that section to bring clarity.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Bearish 123 on H12 USDX. And beautiful 123 on USDJPY H4 at BULLISH REJECTION LEVEL. Shorting here!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
All trades triggered and doing well...except EURJPY. This is one reason I do not trade EJ with my mix of pairs. Who will carry it today? Will it be EURUSD or USDJPY? Who knows.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Closed all Trades.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
great trades yesterday again! thx to show.

a question to the EJ H4 chart: is my blue arrow correct to point the start of the buying rejection line (BRL)?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
and i have another question regarding th UJ H4 chart:

1) the BRL arrow pointing to the start is on the correct place?

2) the SRL (selling rejection level) is correct?

3) can the second BRL line (108, 901) also be a correct SRL?

thx for answer!

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I would say Zone more than an exact line or level, for me both are correct...

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi birdland,

I am off today. Just saw the post.

Yes the BRL is correct. I am not seeing the second BRL so well. The lower SRL is correct as well. That would be the best place to take profit on the short trade.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Yes J1mm,

It really is a zone but we have to watch a price level to know whether and where we should enter and in what direction.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
i am waiting for a "reversal price rejetion" on UJ H1

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Yes it seems correct birdland, I am going to updating post #1 to further explain rejections. But if you look at EJ it also had a SELLING REJECTION LEVEL that it dipped to and bought. So it was a tricky pair to trade.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
UC had a nice move, but the stop was too far away

and UJ is around the trigger line and tries zu reject from there

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hello guys.

Did someone already backtested this strategy over a decent period of time (2 to 5 years)?

What is your performance?

Nice good job you are doing all here.

Regards

--- 帖子 #226 ---
no, because backtesting a strategy which is discretionary, does not work in my eyes.

and this are good news! otherwise we would have people who suggets to make an EA out of it.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi everyone,

Hope you all had a good weekend.

Some nice trade setups today. Long USDCAD. Daily chart showing SELLING REJECTION and H4 Showing Bullish 123.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Gold rejection buying at daily BUYING REJECTION LEVEL and H4 showing 2 consecutive bearish 123 setups. So I am short Gold.

the PA suggests this

--- 帖子 #233 ---
EURUSD just hit H4 & H12 BUYING REJECTION LEVELS.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
stopped out, but i try it a second time...

GJ also did not work...these crosses are difficult

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hey birdland, I didn't want to mess with your trade, but if you look at the GJ daily you will see it just did a bullish 123 and SELLING REJECTION. So be careful with selling it.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
yes thats true, i ignored that.

so better to analyse timeframe up to down and bigger are dominating. W1, D1, H4, H1,...

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Yes, respect the bigger timeframe setups first unless it is a scalp trade. GJ is also at the H12 BUYING REJECTION LEVEL so tricky at this point.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
EURUSD Short running.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
it is great strategy.thanks simoneg.take same trades on demo, its easy to follow strategy by android mt4 on work.how do you come to that 4 forex pairs whitch you trade,with others results its not so good?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Thank you ficibald! I chose some pairs that I believe were most strongly correlated, from reading and research, whether it be positive or negative. Along with the USDX and US30 as guides in make my trading decisions. That was it for me. So I just stick with these pairs.

Glad to hear you have and understanding of the strategy!

Sorry i am still not understand, too slow to picking up..

what is the different the post from birdland with the one posted by simon on post 1

Chart by birdland:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

vs
Chart by simon:
Attached Image

i see we have long trade for birdland's chart.

but simon's answer:
Inserted Code Your purple 123 would not be correct because Bar#3 must have the lowest low.

my guess:

bar 2 and bar 3 must be inside bar 1? bar 2 or bar 3 cant lower that bar 1?

many thanks

--- 帖子 #253 ---
when looking for long signal, Bar#3 has always to be the lowest bar. the wick has to be the lowest from all 3 bars.

Bar#2 can be an inside bar or green or red. Bar#2 is the least important Bar.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi - been watching this thread for a while now and started putting the method into practice. Anyone interested in a skype group so we can keep an eye on potential setups and discuss trades and ideas.

Hello birdland, from the chart that Evole posted, I have a doubt...

We see a waterfall and then price stops a bit and we have a bullish candle, this setup does not suit 1,2,3?

Then price resumes and keeps going down, after some more candles we have more or less the same setup, we should take them or skip them? Why?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
no, its not the pattern introduced by simoneg.

there are many different 123 patterns existing, also here in ff.

but this from evole posted one does not fit into simoneg's 123.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
if i am correct on UJ we are having a daily buying rejection line and a hourly 123 sell signal. for better confirmation i would like to see prices below the daily buying rejection line (109.864)

--- 帖子 #260 ---
crystal clear now.. will try to play FT again later today  thank you birdland

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Everyone,

Glad to see you got your questions answered EVolta!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Long Bullish 123 on EURUSD Daily. It may go a bit lower to the bar#2 close price, if it does I will buy again! USDX also at the sell price of the Daily bearish 123 from last week.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
USDCAD still has some more room to go up, heading into critical buying rejection levels. Zooming out on the H4 you can also see a huge bear crown, so watching keenly for shorting in this area, keeping buying short term right now.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Gold at two strong SELLING REJECTION LEVELS on the H12. Taking Longs in these areas while watching price action over the next 4 hour close and into midday close EST.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
i would buy this only if i see a 123 on H1.

do you wait also for this or just buy into the support-line from bar#2 if you see a rejection?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
You can birdland if that is your preference, but the level, for me has been proven with the buy UP for the past few days. I am also using the H4 to confirm my current entry. As the Buying Rejection levels are holding up, in other words rejecting SELLERS & SUPPORTING BUYERS SO FAR.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Current picture on the NZDUSD H4. I forgot to label the lower horizontal line, which is a selling rejection level on the weekly chart. More confirmation needed here.

Hi Sinoneg,

What did you EDIT yesterday on page 1 ???

BUYING & SELLING REJECTION LEVELS??

What else plz, let me know.  thanks,

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi loveandpeace,

Only the buying and selling rejection levels section was added.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
EURUSD H4 has now closed back above the SELLING REJECTION LEVEL and the DAILY 123 BUY SETUP remains valid.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
USDCAD has failed to go higher at all BUYING REJECTION LEVELS and H4 just created another buying rejection level. Coupled with that, the USDX has failed at last weeks BUYING REJECTION LEVEL creating a double top. Let's see how these levels hold up on the 1 hour.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Long EURUSD at H4 SELLING REJECTION LEVEL.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Short USDCAD at Daily, H12 & H4 BUYING REJECTION LEVELS.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Out of these trades -8pips folks. We're back below EU H4 SELLING REJECTION LEVEL. Selling continues. Also H1 Bearish 123

--- 帖子 #286 ---
My next homework:

Buying Rejection levels are found at the HIGHEST BULLISH CLOSE PRICE of a Swing Low.

Selling Rejection levels are found at the LOWEST BEARISH CLOSE PRICE of a Swing high.

can i interpret like this:

Determine the direction

these level are the valid setup on daily timeframe, and we inspect it on smaller timeframe like H4 and H1, draw the daily level, and we switch to smaller TF, apply the 123 pattern and see the reaction for these level to determine the direction of the price either reject up (to sell), or reject down (to long).

Important level to watch out in future?

once we had those level drawn, when price revisit these level in future, we need to pay attention to its reaction?

is that correct?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Audusd 1h buy

Hi EVolta,

That is correct. Also watch these areas on newly formed/forming swings.

EA to try, based on rules on page 1.

Let me know the feedback.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi Hairi,

Thank your for this effort! I didn't get any setups on UJ for the entire year. Not sure if I did something wrong. Also, does it take into consideration rejection levels? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi ficibald,

While the setup was valid, here is what I always try to do. Mark ALL buying & selling rejection levels on my current timeframe and at least one timeframe above so I can have an idea of the LIFESPAN of my trade. So look at the chart below and see what killed your sell.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi simoneg,

after re-read again all post starting post#1 until last post, i believe i miss some rules. Will rewrite/revised the EA rules again tonight.

btw, i’ve run the BT on GBPUSD, default setting H4.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thank you Hairi!  I will try it!

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Now let's look at the USDCAD, That traded the levels regardless of news. News, to me, only gives fuel. So USDCAD, dropped to h12 SELLING REJECTION LEVEL which it was toying around for awhile and gave this awesome 115+pips 1 bar trade. Now look where it has stopped, right at the Monthly chart BUYING REJECTION LEVEL and below the H12 Buying rejection level. Then H4 forms buying rejection. So we are looking south for next week on USDCAD, while watching reaction to SELLING REJECTION LEVELS below.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Great thread.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi simoneg,

the more i read, the more i don't understand.

for "BUY SETUP", we have 12 possibilities. as below.

can you tell us, which my understanding is wrong??

and perhaps, you can edit my excel file for better understanding.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi Hairi,

Try to get the 123 setup first. Correct scenarios for buying would be 1,4,5,7,10, 11

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Also Hairi,

I got it to work on the gbpusd, had to adjust the spread value it seems. Looks good, so far. Only try to modify entry points a bit. Maybe to 10 pips from recommended entry, I see a lot of expired limit orders that went on to good trades. Sometimes manual trading requires that.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
And guys, more than EA can we have an Indicator or even a Dashboard? Just to help visually confirm the setups, that would help to go through pairs faster I would say...

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Agreed J1mm, that's more what I am looking for. Just to be alerted of setups.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I mean, for this kind of Strategies I found always more helpful a Dashboard + Indicator than automatic EA, maybe a trade manager even, but EA will fail in the long run...

This is not clearly a "when RSI Cross 0" strategy...

--- 帖子 #319 ---
So basically the strategy is:

Buy if previous session close is above the previous two session closes.

Sell if previous session close is below the previous two session closes.

The only adjustments I would make (in case of a Sell) is that the previous session open must also be lower than its prior session close. Also in this case, I would consider the previous session low as a TP.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
i agree J1mm and simoneg.

if an EA works, than fine.

but a visual aid like an arrow pointing a coming, forming 123 pattern with or without the trigger line (optional) would be my christmas wish

anyway, hairi good work!

--- 帖子 #321 ---
attached DC3C indicator. (mt4)

before you use the indicator, better to test run it on strategy tester to see how it's behave.

It will repaint DC3C setup to the latest.

Default MTF is Period H4 (user input variable).

you can attached this indicator to any timeframe, but referring to H4 setup.

...and sorry, no alert.

--- 帖子 #322 ---

Hi Simone

Are you able to confirm this from post one?

Buying Rejection levels are found at the HIGHEST BULLISH CLOSE PRICE of a Swing Low.

Selling Rejection levels are found at the LOWEST BEARISH CLOSE PRICE of a Swing high.

I would have thought that buying rejection levels would be found in a swing high and selling rejection levels in a swing low? Are you able to show a chart with these marked?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
yes, looks bullish in the shortterm.

i am short for a swing and will hold for a couple of days.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi Foxinvest,

You have quoted me correctly. Look at your charts and you will see that greatest fight is to continue beyond these levels if the trend is weak.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Yes birdland, I am stacking for 40-45pips

--- 帖子 #381 ---
So is a swing low 5 candles? I.e. The lowest low with 2 higher lows to the left and 2 higher lows to the right? And then looking at the highest bullish close of these 5 candles?

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Is this correct?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
no,

the triggerline would be from the close of Bar#1

then its a correct signal.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Can you provide clear rules? I read all thread and I see different versions.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
look at simones and my examples, trades...a picture tells more then everything and then it should be clear.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Why?

Market is tending downwards (Yes)

Bar 3 have a lower low (Yes)

Bar 3 close above Bar 1 open (Yes)

--- 帖子 #416 ---
the triggerline is always related to Bar#1

but yes, you can buy where your red line is. i think i missunderstood you;-)

i personally like to wait for the triggerline to buy there around because risk is less then your red line.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi Alesh,

I see birdland already answered your questions.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
GM FF,

Using my own forum to say...

It takes something for an individual to FREELY share something that he believes or that is beneficial to himself and others. When you encounter such an individual, be appreciative. That's just a good character trait... to be appreciative. You don't owe, since the person shared freely, but APPRECIATE IT, especially when it has helped you.

It takes a certain kind of low OR pride NOT to appreciate that kind of help. I pray traders will have more character...good character that is. Maybe then we will all become more successful!

So I continue to trade my candlestick system and when combined with DAVIT'S PIVOTS it does very well.

THANK YOU DAVIT! YOUR SYSTEM HAS HELPED ME! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! MANY OF US APPRECIATE IT!

--- 帖子 #419 ---
i fully agree you. davits approach is a great gift to the (small) community.

and there is always a percentage of destroyers waiting for a chance. the best is not to focus on these and block them immediatelly.

davit said his system is more like fishing with a wide net than hunting with a harpune.

when combined with your approach, simone, or others it can be also a harpune. i see your pattern clearly around pivots occuring...

also i like to use for example atheers "the only pattern" for good entries:
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=607008

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Indeed birdland...ignore and move on. And yes, in combining you find your EDGE. That's all you need.

Hello Simoneg,

I found NZDUSD H4  (as I attched image)  . The red arrow is sell signal  and then the blue arrow gives buy signal. Are there any filter here ?

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Sorry I missed your post tbtduc...its good to wait for a test of your entry level. That's my best filter.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Also this setup was not valid...the market was trending DOWN prior to that bearish 123. We look for these setups after a period of Upward trending.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hi Simone / everyone - Thanks for this great thread - I've been following the system for some time now and it seems to work really well.

One quick question, assuming I mark the setup accurately according to the rules, sometimes it doesn't quite get back down to the textbook entry levels on Long setups, then rockets skywards, especially on frisky currency pairs like Cable.

In these cases is it OK to go in a bit higher than the perfect entry price, to make sure I get into the trade? Means a bit longer stop, of course, but in many cases this is OK. If not, I miss out on getting into some real high-quality trades.

Exactly the same happens in reverse on Short setups

More sedate currency pairs seem to obey the setup rules much better, but some more volatile pairs just get away from me.

Thanks again, Paul

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thank you Paul!

That is exactly what I do. Take some smaller entries first and then improve on those entries as the trade plays out. Yes it often shoots off away from the ideal entry.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Thanks, Simone.

I love the way this trading system gets you in at a high-probability swing point with a rather modest stop loss.

When the setups succeed - which is often, in my experience - you can usually get a 3:1 or better Reward:Risk ratio, which is magic!

If the setup fails, as all trades do sometimes, the relatively tight stop loss means you live to fight another day.

I love the idea that you can apply this approach on different timeframes - I've been experimenting on the 1-Hour chart, but plan to aim for 4-Hour or Daily chart trades. I use MT4 that doesn't seem to offer 12-Hour charts, but I guess you can do those on MT5 or other charting platforms.

I'm using Weekly Pivot levels on the 1-Hour and 4-Hour charts, and Monthly Pivot levels on the Daily, to help me spot, then qualify, likely swing points. Plus the occasional Fibonacci 50% or 76.4 / 78.6% level which also often act as a catalyst for swing points, in my experience.

Thanks again for sharing, and for all your support to the thread!

Best wishes, Paul

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Paul, sounds like your peeking at my monitors . I see you have spent some time with the system and appreciate it. When I trade it on H1 I look for the IDEAL setups, H4 and higher is great. Trade well!

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Good opportunity upcoming on UC H4

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi again Simone

Oh no, you caught me peeking at your monitors! Sorry ...

I was wondering if you have found any good way to find the S + R levels at which swings are likely to occur?

I've tried Fibo's, and various time periods of Pivot Levels, but these are all bit hit and miss.

Nothing seems to work better than using your eyes to spot S + R Zones on the relevant charts, eg 4-Hour and Daily.

Mapping out the S + R Zones on the attached GBP/USD 4-Hour chart for example, I can see the high probability swing levels. I use Pink (R) or Powder Blue (S) rectangles on MT4 to show the zones on my MT4 charts.

And I think it helps with the other issue of price turning in the "right" direction from a setup, before the textbook entry level is reached - if I carefully map out the S + R zones beforehand, I feel more confident going in a bit early, provided the setup is solid.

Does this make sense to you, or do you have a neater way to spot likely swing levels?

I'd love to know!

Best wishes, Paul

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hahaha...

Yes I have a way of finding my own "PIVOT" levels. Since PIVOT suggests turning point. I go to the Weekly chart and take the Lowest Bearish Bar HIGH of each Swing Low as the Best SELL Levels for the Week and the Highest Bullish Bar LOW as the Best BUY Levels. I also do this on the Daily and Monthly and this gives me a pretty strong idea of the S/R Levels to trade. Hope this explains it. So for example UC just hit the daily SHORT level and sold off and closed strong below a WEEKLY BUY level...meaning likely strong bearish movement from hear on. USDCHF just hit MONTHLY Sell Level and is making a decision. Hope this is clear. Let me know if you have any questions.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
This EU H4 chart shows how the levels traded yesterday.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
@Paul A quick note on Fibs, you may find using the fib extension 190.2 as a very very helpful tool for daily and weekly targets.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
V. cool ... thank you so much for sharing this!

I'm not quite sure I understand how it works yet, so please see attached chart of the USD/CHF Weekly.

Have I marked correctly the Lowest Bearish Bar High of the current Swing Low?

Or do you mean the Lowest Bearish Bar High of the most recent Swing Low above current price action, which would put it at 0.9829?

When you say UC, do you mean USD/CHF? Sorry I don't see the setup you are talking about currently.

Thanks, Paul

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi Paul,

Yes you have marked the level correctly. Also look at previous weeks/days/monthly levels within the current price zone.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
OK, thanks.

So, I presume that the equivalent Best BUY Level is the is the Highest Bullish Bar Low of the current Swing High - have I marked this one correctly, please?

And you carry out a similar analysis on Daily, Weekly, and Monthly to get a multi-timeframe perspective, showing the Best Buy and Best Sell levels on each one?

Thanks again, Paul

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Yes the HIGHEST BULLISH BAR LOW. In your snapshot you have picked the wrong low. Yes the same goes for the other timeframes. It is also great to use on H4 for adding positions or entries.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks, I misunderstood.

Do I now understand correctly that you mean the HIGHEST LOW of a BULLISH BAR in the most recent Swing High?

As marked on the attached chart?

Thanks, Paul

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Sorry Paul, eyes fixed on US Politics

That's the Highest Bullish Bar Low in the SWING HIGH STRUCTURE (consists of 5 bars)

--- 帖子 #446 ---
CHF WEEKLY Levels. Also note that the most current level is not yet fully confirmed as we need two mar bars to complete the swing low structure

--- 帖子 #447 ---
OK, so the Highest Bullish Bar Low in the 5-bar Swing High structure, do I understand?

In which case, have I now marked this correctly in the attached chart, please?

And presumably the Lowest Bearish Bar High in a 5-bar Swing Low structure for Best SELL level?

Thanks, Paul

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Correct Paul!

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Thanks, Simone!

And, for the avoidance of doubt, when choosing which Swing High and which Swing Low to consider, we choose :

1. The highest current COMPLETED SWING HIGH.

2. The lowest  current COMPLETED SWING LOW.

where "COMPLETED" means that the 5 bars in the swing pattern have all closed?

In other words we don't consider as-yet-incomplete Swing High or Swing Low patterns, until all 5 bars have closed?

I am trying to use the Fractal indicator to help me visualise which swing patterns are completed and which are not.

Sorry to be so pedantic, but I am trying to use the precise definition to make sure I understand your Weekly USD/CHF sample chart's Green and Red levels, to make sure I can go through the same process on other charts.

Thank you so much for all your assistance with this .. this is all great stuff!

Best wishes, Paul

--- 帖子 #450 ---
this technique is awesome, not much different with pivot.

i have a good feeling for this technique.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I actually mark ALL the weekly and monthly levels within the trading range. Even daily, you can adjust this as you see fit. But these levels are very much respected so I keep them on my charts to make decisions. To get a good idea of what I am saying, check out how buying and selling continues at these levels on an H4 chart (using H4 chart levels) and you will see.

Yes we need the 5 bars to close to confirm the Swing low or high.

Fractals help a whole lot with easily picking the levels. If  you are using Metatrader search under Bill Williams Indicators.

For me the red levels mean selling can continue strongly from here or buying can continue strongly from here. So Based on the PA I place my trades.

Your'e welcome Paul.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Is that rite?? Thks Great stuff you have going here

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Cool, thanks Simone!

Yes, I'm already using the Bill Williams Fractal indicator on MT4, helps a lot.

Thanks for the 190.2% Fibo level tip .. now, that's one Fibo level I am not familiar with at all - I know the usual 127.2, 161.8, 200, 261.8 extensions, of course.

And thank you so much for the Lowest Bearish High / Highest Bullish Low S + R level tip!!!  I'm marking my charts up right now in preparation for London opening in a couple of hours time.

I guess in trading with these levels, you just mark them on your charts and see how PA reacts when it gets to those levels.

I assume they also highlight possible turning points for new Swing Highs / Lows.

Whether PA ends up respecting or instead fading the level, it tells you where price is likely to react, one way or the other, which is very useful information!

Best wishes, Paul

Hi Simone - hope you are well!

One question for you, please: do you mark all three - Monthly, Weekly and Daily - Best BUY and Best SELL levels on your charts on a routine basis?

Or do you just mark the Best BUY and Best SELL levels for a couple of timeframes higher than you are trading?

That is, if you are trading the H4 chart, do you mark just the Daily and Weekly Best BUY and Best SELL levels?

If you are trading the D1 chart, do you mark the Weekly and Monthly Best BUY and Best SELL levels?

Even in my limited experimentation with them so far, I can see that these are powerful levels that price tends to respect.

Best wishes, Paul

--- 帖子 #463 ---
No problem at all rookie14. I'll pm you shortly.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I wish I could respond in voice....I'm driving.

I draw the Monthly and weekly levels on my H4 charts and use H4 levels to enter trades based on reactions to those bigger levels.

I quickly look at h12 and daily to see where corrections may occur.

To give an idea...UC gave H4 short setup and initial entries were on H4 so I assumed the next H4 levels to be my target. With each hourly close I go down to h1to see if there was a close below a Best Sell and add positions/entries there.

Hope I have answered your questions.

If I've marked up my charts correctly, there seems to me to be a bit of a battle of the giants going on with the Swissie (USD/CHF) at the moment.

A marked upward movement stalled at the Monthly Best SELL level around 0.97730 or thereabouts.

The 4-Hour Best SELL level is now in the same area, at about 0.97772, helping create a Resistance zone.

Monthly Best BUY beckons at around 0.97883, but if price can't make it up there and close above, then the Swissie may short off for a bit.

Post Script - Right now, late Friday after market close, looks like a decisive move above the Monthly Best BUY level.

Should make for interesting trading next week ...

Let's see what Monday brings!

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Nice one Paul. Yes it's still bullish even on H12.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Looks like there are some good Short opportunities on the Euro this morning, shortly after London opening.

Possible Short entry somewhere in the range 1.16167 - 1.16278, with Stop Loss above the 4-Hour Best BUY level at 1.16374.

There is also a good chance, of course, that price won't come back to the entry level at all, but just keep going down.

We shall see.

Right now, as it happens, I am already in the opposite trade, the Swissie (USD/CHF) Long, entry at 0.9813, Stop Loss very tight at 0.9804.

Next big news - ISM - out at 14:00 GMT.

Interesting position on Cable (GBP/USD) at the moment, just after the 9:30 am BST news.

Price is around the Daily and 4-Hour Best SELL levels, with Weekly, Daily and 4-Hour Best BUY levels not that far above.

I guess we have to wait and see which way it chooses to go.

However, the Swissie (USD/CHF) still seems pretty bullish, so I would normally expect Cable to head in the opposite direction, given the Euro's weakness too.

Big question is how price will react to the 1.30546 Weekly Best BUY level - will it reject the level and bounce back down, or will it close over the line and continue on up?

Cable always marches to its own drum, I find, so let's just see what direction it chooses to march in!

POST SCRIPT - At 13:41 BST (12:41 GMT), in the middle of my nice Cable Short trade, a sudden +89.7 PIP blue candle appeared in less than 1 minute (see attached picture)!!! Apparently in response to an announcement at the UK Tory Party Conference about concessions made relating to Ireland, intended to ease Brexit negotiations. Prior to that my Cable Short trade was nicely positive, about 30+ Pips, so I ended up making +1 PIP profit, when it suddenly came out on the BE+1 Stop Loss level I had set for it.

Got a good trade on gold. EU tricky at the moment. H12 Best sell being rejected but sitting below daily best sell.  Longs best above 1.1618 for me. Also watching H1 two best sell levels around 1.1590-95 providing support.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Long GU H4 REJECTED BEST SELL.

Long NU DAILY REJECTED BEST SELL.

Long EU @ 2 H1 Best Sells Being rejected for the last couple of hours.

Short UC WEEKLY BEST SELL @ 1.2818 Looking for TP around 1.2700 (Weekly fib 190.2).

Would rather wait for Swiss Franc to make at least and H4 statement right now.

Always pay close attention to the PA around the levels. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Good morning, Simone - thanks a lot for these notes - they are very helpful.

As you say, the Euro is a bit funny at the moment, so I'm hoping that ISM in 8 minutes time will help clarify matters.

As I've noted before, if bankers and politicians would just stop talking in public, particularly on TV, it would make our trading a lot easier!

We have the Conservative Party Conference on today here in the UK, and a little Brexit announcement they made earlier this afternoon at 13:41 GMT caused an immediate 1-minute +89.7 PIP spike up on an otherwise short Cable (GBP/USD).

--- 帖子 #474 ---
First off Simoneg, thank you for this resource, it’s done nothing but help me further develop my fingerprint in FX trading. I’m still fairly new, and am extremely appreciative in your insight and patience  with these posts.

do you mind giving bing me some further insight into why you don’t like trading the EJ? I’m just curious, Especially with the who will carry it comment?

currently I follow Xauusd and usdjpy, butbwill eventually scan a few pairs once my strat is better defIned. Hence why I ask, some insight into why you avoid certain pairs with this strategy.

Thanks again!

Ryan

After a bit of an upwards correction yesterday, the Euro (EUR/USD) has shorted off from the Daily Best SELL level which I have at 1.15799.

I got in Short at 1.15809, and it's currently around 1.15609, about 20 +ve PIPs.

I've put my Stop Loss down to BE+1 and am just waiting to see what happens when New York opens in just over an hour's time.

ISM is out at 14:00 UTC, so I'm hoping for some USD +ve news to help kick the the Euro (EUR/USD) down and the Swissie (USD/CHF) up.

I'm Long the Swissie - up +31.4 PIPs so far, with Stop Loss at BE+1.

Post Script - Please note that the level I have marked as 4-Hour Best Sell level on the chart is NOT correct, my mistake. However, the Daily Best SELL level is good on my MT4 charts from Admiral Markets.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi

At first , for sell, high bar#3>high bar#2>high bar#1 , is correct?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks Ra! I trade strongly correlated pairs and you can get mixed results trading EJ as both UJ and EU can influence its movement. So I find trading EU, XAUUSD, UC & USDCHF much easier.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hey Paul,

I only have an H4 best sell and 1.15797 my daily best sell is at 1.1570

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Immediately after ISM announcement 9 minutes ago, I closed my two trades from earlier.

1. Swissie (USD/CHF) Long closed at 190.2% Fibo level at 0.98939 for a profit of +53.5 PIPs.

2. Euro (EUR/USD) Short closed at 76.4% Fibo level at 1.15276 for a profit of +53.3 PIPs.

So, over 100 PIPs between the two trades, so I'm quite pleased with that.

See Post #471 on Page #24 for details of the setup.

With grateful thanks to simoneg for sharing this super trading setup!!!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi Simone

Looking back, you're right, of course - my 4-Hour Best SELL is wrongly marked on the Swing High instead of the Swing Low - my mistake. I have amended my write-up in Post #471 on Page #24, to avoid confusing anyone following the thread.

My Daily Best SELL price is at 1.15799, just a bit above yours.

I'm using MT4 charts from Admiral Markets, so the pricing is probably a little bit different from yours.

Either way, it seemed to work .. was worth a +53.3 PIPs Short!

When marking Best BUY and Best SELL prices, I am using the latest potential Swing Levels, which somtimes have not fully formed yet, so I review them with every new 4-Hour candle ... I assume this is correct protocol?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Nice...yes Paul...that's correct. The most current is better.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Greetings Simoneg,

When you have some time can you please explain a bit about how to measure/use 190.2% fibo level, with some examples please

Thanks in advance

R

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Oh dear...please forgive me rookie14. I will do so on the weekend when I have a bit more time.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Not a problem

Thanks and regards

R

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hi rookie14!

I don't know what charting software you are using.

Whatever it is, you should be able to program in the different Fibo levels you want to use, for example, 50% 76.4%, and so on. If you can include the level 190.2%, it will show you the market's reaction when price reaches the 190.2% Fibo extension level of a previous swing down or up.

For example, in Metatrader 4, you put in the Fibo level 1.902 %$ to show the 190.2% Fibo extension level on your charts, and the relevant price when it hits that level.

Simone is saying that the 190.2% Fibo extension is a significant level at which price tends to react, either shorting off and going lower, or breaking out ("breakout") the level and going even higher - either reaction is significant.

Our job as traders is not to predict either reaction, but simply to observe, and react accordingly whether it goes higher or lower.

The significance of the level is simply that it is a key potential turning point - we just need to watch, and see what happens!

Please be in no doubt, Simone's trading system that she describes here is an absolute treasure!

I hope that this helps - if you have any further questions, feel free to ask.

Best wishes, Paul

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Thanks Loudoniii

Sorry for being silly, can you or Simone attach some charts examples please

I just want to see A,B, C pattern reaching to 190.2 level

Thanks and regards

R

--- 帖子 #487 ---
No problem, rookie14 - it's a prefectly fair question.

Herewith example of today's action on the Euro, showing how price reacts to the 190.2% Fibo level on the 4-Hour chart.

I made +53.3 PIPs out of this Euro Short trade, but had I stayed in a bit longer, I could have made quite a bit more.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Thank you Paul! I had just come online to see if I could squeeze in a quick explanation.

Just to add a bit more to what Paul has stated. My thinking is that the 190.2% Fib extension is a PRIME TARGET. Therefore the trend will continue until "A" 190.2% extension is reached. Whether it be on the Monthly, Weekly, or Daily.

The Daily & Weekly are my key focus. If the 190.2 is not reached on the week that begins a trend, I continue to see the trend in that direction until that target is met.

Take for example the USDCAD chart attached. The Week of Sept 9-14th just achieved its target this week after correcting and them giving that huge sell. Now we are long.

Then let's look at Gold, which reversed right at the weekly BEST SELL after hitting the 190.2.

Finally we have Gold again, correcting/reversing after achieving the 190.2 of this August 15th Daily Fib.

And we are simply fibbing the high/low of the day (daily fib) or week (weekly fib).

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Fast foward to EU today.

We shorted the H4 Best Sell, and continue to short towards the 190.2, which converges with another H4 best sell. This is our likely target. I hope this clears up your questions.

Kind regards.

--- 帖子 #490 ---

2nd bar closed below than 1st close,

3rd bar closed above than 2nd bar's close,

4th bar closed above than 3rd open,

SELL,

2nd bar closed above than 1st close,

3rd bar closed below than 2nd close,

4th bar closed below than 3rd open,

--- 帖子 #497 ---
simone,

to help SwingMan and us to understand you correct regarding the best buy/sell levels:

are these levels the same like you mentioned before the "buy/sell rejection levels"?

if SwingMan understands the concept right (and we need to support him as much as possible) he could maybe built an indi for these very interesting S&R-levels, which are (like you mentioned already) powerful. and i think more powerful like pivots we know already from davit.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Thank you very much!

It is that I did not quite understand how to identify the Swings.

It seems to me that the idea is similar to "Guppy Count Back Line".

In this thread https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...35#post8492935

you will find a .pdf description and the indicator. You could go from Guppy's 3 bars to 5. I will also try to think about it.

HI Swingman

First off the first indi  is great. Works great..I only have some filters for Optimal setups and takeout. I will send these later. Have them saved on my laptop.

The best buy and best sell are NOT the same as previously described rejection levels.

BEST BUY

This is the low of the highest bullish bar low in a 5 bar swing high

BEST SELL

This is the High of the lowest bearish bar high in a 5 bar swing low

SWING LOW

Consists of 5 bars with the middle bar having the lowest the low and having two bars with higher lows on the left and right

SWING HIGH

Middle bar has the highest high and two bars on the left with lower highs and two bars on the right lower highs

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Thank you Swing man. I will look at this as well.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
thank you, its also interesting to study the "guppy count back line", but as i see its not the same concept as the "best buy/sell levels".

hopefully you understand post 504 from simone, which seems to be a clear description.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
OK,

The SWING's are fractals, all other is simple.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Yes Swingman!

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hi again SwingMan. The Guppy Count Back Line is different from the strategy we are using here.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi Simoneg

I like your thread. Thank you for starting it.

For 2 weeks I was a bit confused in trying to understand the concept, until I saw your post 504.

'The best buy and best sell are NOT the same as previously described rejection levels.'

I have summarized the points using my own understanding in paraphrasing them.

Would appreciate your help in vetting them through.

Would be happy if another trader can understand this perspective.

All swing low and swing high consists of 5 bars.

1. Reversal (Can also be applied to Continuation)

- Swing low Buy is when Bar 3 closes above Bullish bar 1 open or Bearish bar 1 close

(Market could be Bearish if price is unable to close above highest Bullish bar close)

- Swing high Sell is when Bar 3 closes below Bearish bar 1 open or Bullish bar 1 close

(Market could be Bullish if price is unable to close below lowest Bearish bar close)

2. Rejection of Reversal

- Swing high Buy is at lowest Bearish bar close (where price is unable to close below)

- Swing low Sell is at highest Bullish bar close (where price is unable to close above)

3. Continuation

- Swing high Best Buy is at highest Bullish bar low

- Swing low Best Sell is at lowest Bearish bar high

Thank you

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hey SwingMan,

It doesn't seem to be picking the levels correctly. Even from the chartshot you have, the best buy is the Highest bullish bar Low in the Swing High and the best sell the Lowest Bearish Bar High in the Swing Low.

The best buy is only found in the swing highs and the best sells are only found in the swing lows.

Look at the attached chart AUDJPY H4, with the correct levels marked against the indi's picks.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
You are right, I have made a small correction in code.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
SwingMan, is it possible to pick all best buy/best sell levels, on the upper timeframe, on the Major Swing that price is trading within?

See the attached for example. The thing is the current indi shows the Best Buy best vuy/sell levels for Only one swing. So once price moves away from the swing, there are no more UPPER TIMEFRAME Zones to trade.

Take for instance the attached GJ Weekly chart which shows the levels for the swing that price just broke above, and should now be encountering the weekly best sell at about 149.67. However, we would miss that information going into the new week.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Another example of what I'm saying, here is an H4 Gold chart. Should price begin trading above the best sell or below the best buy, how will the indi react? In other words, will it examine the next swing being traded for best buy best sell levels?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
thanks for this indicator

is the swing high best buy and swing low best sell are the only ones that are still valid for entries after the 5 bar swing has been completed?

Hi timilehin,

You have to approach the levels as when trading Support and Resistance. We watch to see how price is reacting to the levels and trade accordingly. Of course, higher timeframe levels are more respected.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
what i meant to say is that for the 3 bar set up , are they still valid for sell after weeks later?

even after when a bar closes above the most top left hand fractal?

thanks.seem not to get the set up/system

--- 帖子 #554 ---
hi timilehin

the summary i made is in post 510. one needs a clear mind to understand, a bit confusing at first.

however the trade was made in anticipation, without the 5 bar swing high being completed.

now i have to see whether price will close below bar 5 close (which will be the actual swing high buy reversal if it is a bearish bar) to exit the trade or not,

or hold on if it does not close below.

i am also in the midst of learning now to get the feel.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi Inthebox,

The indicator is still being worked on so right now you will realize that the signals are being given before the fractal structure is completed, which is not good.

Looking at your trade, you will see that you had a COMPLETED SWING LOW STRUCTURE with a very valid best sell, that was tested for 8 hours. So the trade opportunity, was to short at the best sell level. Once price is dancing around a swing low, think sell, and then look for how it is responding to best sell level. Vice Versa for Swing Highs.

I hope this has helped you.

--- 帖子 #556 ---

hi simoneg

do you consider this a valid swing high sell when bar 3 did not close below it? but only later by bar 4 or 5.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
That would have been a good short (taken on a lower tf) , but look at what's happening now at this Swing Low, where the market sold a little then completely rejected sellers closing back above the best sell and creating a 3 Bar Buy Setup.

Also keep in mind that a BEST BUY LEVEL is right there, so if buyers mean business, price will close above it and continue from there.

Always wait to see how price treats the level.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
i was wondering whether the swing high sell would be the exit point for my buy. unless there is further development with sell signal.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
It depends on your trading personality. You could choose to take profit there, then wait for another trade decision. However you are most comfortable.

--- 帖子 #573 ---

This morning (UK time), I went long on the Swissie (USD/CHF) when it started to bounce back up off the Daily Best BUY line which I have at 0.99091.

It also did a decisive 4-Hour close above both the 4-Hour Best SELL and Daily Best SELL lines, which has to be a bullish sign.

Now heading towards the 4-Hour Best BUY, so a close above that would be a solid bullish indication.

So far so good.

Am also short the Euro (EUR/USD).

POST SCRIPT at 15:42 UTC - Isn't it great when life gets in the way of your amazing plans? Maybe as Simone counselled, I should have been more careful trying to trade this little Buy/Sell zone ... I got out of these two trades as soon as it became clear it wasn't going to work out.

Hello simoneg

Brilliant work between you and swingman on this indicator ... my observations thus far ..

1) I know trades are taken at H4 & H12 but when the indicator is displayed on H1 timeframe it displays H1 and D1 values rather rather then H1 & H4 values, as H4 is the next timeframe up

2) A minor point but if we can modify thickness of the lines the indicator is more easier to read on the main charts

Hi Rafaz1,

If you setup the indicator on your H1 charts and change the uppertimeframe to H4 you should get the result you are looking for.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Swingman, I agree with Rafaz on having an option to change the settings on the Upper timeframe lines, whether it be the color or thickness or both to make it a bit easier to distinguish between the levels. Please if possible.

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #587 ---
It's okay.

A question: should we have two or three upper time frames as parameters?

Example: on H4 should we have D1, W1 and also MN1, or only D1, W1?

Hello Swingman and Simoneg,

To make and keep things simple with this indicator and preventing the file size getting any bigger (as that will impact computer CPU usage) I suggest the following;

1) The lines drawn on the main chart should be fully adjustable , i.e. colour and thickness changeable to represent the different timeframes

2) On the parameters I would suggest that iF the user is in timeframe H1 then the indicator should display buy/sell for timeframe H1 + buy /sell the for the next 2 time frames up, H4 and D1. However, if the user is in timeframe H4, then buy/sell will be displayed for H4, D1 & W1 and so on and so forth

However, if 3 timeframes displayed on the current timeframe are of no value then stick with just 2 timeframes, so for example;

a) H1 will display buy/sell for H1 + H4

b) H4 will display buy/sell for H4 + D1

I will leave it to what other also think but I think the above is a very workable solution.

I will also be supplying a true trend indicator that when used with the 3SMA indicator would add further confluence to our trades.

Hi Swingman,

I believe two would be sufficient. I had aslo asked about looking into "older" swings on the Higher Timeframe.

For example right now, GU is facing the JULY 29TH WEEKLY BEST SELL. But we would not be able to get that information from the indi as it is right now.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
If 2 timeframes are suffice then SwingMan please ensure;

1) When the 2 timeframe buy/sell information is displayed, please ensure H4 info is distinguishable from D1 (it must not overlap each other hence it must readable, feel free to abbreviate if you have to, so Best Buy H4, can be displayed as BBH4, Best Sell D1 can be displayed as BSD1 (PRICE INFORMATION is not important as mt4 provides that as default)

2) The user should be able to change the thickness and colours of the lines representing the timeframe information as discussed previously

Please let me know if I am not clear in my dialogue or if I can clarify anything for you

Too slow and Simoneg,

No need to get jittery, I am simply asking SwingMan to refine the existing indicator to ensure flexibility and readability on the charts.

I actually, now having thought about it a little more, think that having 3 timeframes buy/sell values (abbreviated as per my previous post) on the same chart maybe more useful/productive and will act better as support/resistance also.

Can we get swingman to do maybe 2 of the same indicator, 1 with 2 timeframe values and 1 with 3 ...OR ..

The same indicator can be modified to give us a 'drop-down' parameter to select the next 1, 2 & 3 timeframes up from our current timeframe selection?

Cheers

Yes Rafaz1, but all we are trading is the system with no added indicators. Not much more is needed with what Swingman is helping us with. Which by the way is a tremendous effort on his own freewill. So we are humbly asking for his help, as much as he can and is willing to extend.

Trading this same setup from yesterday Ra.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Ok I get it.

SwingMan - If you do indeed have time could you make the following changes;

1) 1, 2 & 3 time selection drop down box from parameters, i.e 1 means 1 up from current so if H1 is current timeframe we would have buy/sell for H1 & H4

2 means 2 up from current so if H4 is current timeframe we would have buy/sell for H4 ,D1 & W1

3 means 2 up from current so if H1 is current timframe we would have buy/sell for H1, H4, D1 & W1

2) Feel free to abbreviate the values

3) Cosmetic changes to the buy/sell values , in terms of thickness and colours

Thank you

swingman is not the santa claus.

i asked him to take a look at these best buy/sell lines, because i saw the potential.

in bulding this indicator to make us all trading these lines easier ONLY simoneg can or better should be in charge with swingman. i see myself for this period on the sidelines, in respect of this phenomenal work swingman did in tandem with simoneg!

Hello Birdland,

Apologies I wasn't meaning to step on anyone's toes or undermine the good work people have done here.

I understood the thread and simply thought a couple of more refinements to the existing indicator would yield better picturalisation / readability on the mt4 platform.

Having said that , please do tell elaborate more on how you came to realise this  buy/sell potential, i.e. what is the underlying formula?

Cheers

I’ve been following this thread for a few weeks, and believe in essence, Simone has emphasized that this is very much based on discretionary trading, adding more complexity to the indicators will add more reliance on the indicator... which IMO is bad. With all do respect rafaz1, this thread was more about learning and trading the style, not debating about who thinks what about further building out an indicator. Let’s appreciate what SwingMan and Simone has worked on and let them do their thing.

Hi SwingMan,

No this is not what I was thinking of at all. If it is going to get too complexed and clog the charts, I would rather work with the current indicator with the option of adding up to two upper timeframes and adjusting the colors/thickness. I think that will be enough.

And thanks a ton for all your help SwingMan!

Hello all,

The forex market for me opens at 8am UK time.

Is the opening of the market irrelevant to the calculations of the best buy/sell indicator?

Thanks you

--- 帖子 #620 ---
It shouldn't make any difference to Swingman's Best BUY / SELL indicator, I don't believe, Rafaz1.

Just the normal difference based on the start time of the 4-Hour candle, which will depend on your broker's specific MT4 server time setting, which they should be able to tell you.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Hi Swingman

I just wanted to say a huge THANK YOU for coding this indicator - it really rocks!

I'm reasonably familiar with Simone's trading system now and have always had fun painstakingly marking the Best BUY / SELL levels then keeping them up to date as the trading day progresses.

Today, I finally worked out how to use your indicator to mark all the time period BEST BUY / SELL levels on a single chart, hence single MT4 template that I can use on all timeframes and all currency pairs. The last finesse was remembering how to move the MT4 Shift button to make sure I can see all the level wording on the right hand side regardless of how much I am zoomed in or zoomed out of the chart.

The way the indicator dynamically adjusts the levels is nothing short of AWESOME!!!

This is creating great dynamic trading opportunities when I see price closing over a critical support level, or bouncing back at a key resistance level.

One thing in particular it is helping me with is having more confidence to get in on an existing trend, at a goodly level too. Previously I have been very frustrated when price races away from my perfect setup in the direction I thought it would go in, before retracing sufficiently to let me get in at an optimum level.

Now, price's reaction to the various Best BUY / SELL levels that are being updated dynamically, is signalling to me clear opportunities to get in, or take profit, as appropriate.

Thank you so much for all your hard work on the indicator - it is very greatly appreciated!!!

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Thank you Loudinii for your comments ...

I also think there has been some fabulous work gone on with this indicator and it is dynamic and changing/reacting to the market which is great (although i must admit i think i have only recently worked out the underlying formula/calculation but may still be wrong in my assumption)

I have taken 2 trades today EURUSD and EURCAD with the aid of this indicator as a further confluencing factor to take buys. I use something called True Trend in conjunction with the best buy/sell 3sma indicator. I attach it for everyone to look at.

For the true trend indicator change the parameter settings to; Trend CCI = 20 and Entry CCI 2 then watch how this indicator lets you know the true trend position and when confirmed with the buy/sell 3 sma indicator you can be a lot more confident in taking your buy / sell trades.

Hi newtrader.  This is a 123 pattern but not the ideal setup that I trade. Try to identify the ideals. They are very reliable and powerful.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Also Newtrader. The number 3 bar would have been the lowest bullish bar in your snapshot and the entry line would be and the open price of bar#1 which in this case is the open price of the bullish bar just before that bearish bar at the swing low.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hi Simon, Thanks for your advise.

What do you mean by ideal setup?

Hi Simoneg,

Thanks for a wonderful setup. really thank you from bottom of my heart

However I have not understood this system completely. Please help answering the following questions

1) this system only requires seeing the total 3 candles? the current one and the last 2 ?

2) In case of buy, the first 2 candles should have lower high and lower low and the third candle should close higher than candle 2 and its low should be lower than the first 2 candles?

--- 帖子 #644 ---
You're welcome Tanmayagrawa!

Answer to Q1: Yes, for the 3 Candle setup...only three candles, #3 having the Highest High (for SELL) or Lowest Low (for BUY)

Answer to Q2: For Sell, the first two candles should have LOWER HIGHS. For Buy, the first two candles should have HIGHER LOWS.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Thanks for the quick reply, sis

I have got a bit confused now. So if i go with sell setup, here are the rules

1st step - look at 3 candles

2nd step - second candle high should be lower than first one

3rd step - third candle high should be higher than first 2 candles and close should be lower than atleast 2nd candle.

If the above rules are correct then in the first post that you posted here, you shared sell screenshot. In that pic, the second candle high is higher than the first candle which should not be the case.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
All that matters, in the case of a sell, is that the 1st and 2nd candles have highs that are lower that that of the 3rd. Do not try to compare the high of candle 1 and 2. That is not relevant at all.

Hope this clears up your question.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I will be upload the 3 Candle indicator in POST#1 soon. Just waiting for a small adjustment to made.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Thanks for the help Simoneg. Its clear now

By the way don't you think that markets generally retest a level twice (double bottom or double tops) so markets don't give V shape reversal patterns often.

In these cases what do you do ? Do you take entries as per the rules or you take entries on second retest?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Simoneg, I have marked 3 levels at which we can make entries.

Please check it and let me know if they are correct ? It seems that in the first case, I would not have got any entry.

second would be loss

Third one would be profitable.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Yes T, it often does. I take both entries...the initial and the swing back (retest)

Happy it is clearer to you now.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Ok, so your first was not a valid setup because, Bar 3 failed to close above the open and close of bars #1 & 2 (recheck this rule)

Your second setup was still valid, and failed.

Then immediately following the second setup was a valid short setup which won. No more setups on your chart.

Make sure after checking the highs and lows, that you also confirm that bar#3 closes as per the rules.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
These should help a bit more...

--- 帖子 #653 ---
In the second case, where the setup failed, do you think we would actually have suffered this loss since at the buy entry price, the sell setup would be ready for me. So one would not have taken the buy. Is that so ?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Sorry T, when the kids are up...

I would have closed the trade after the opposite setup developed, at least a small loss would have been suffered.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Thanks a lot Simoneg for your help. I really appreciate it. You have perfectly managed the thread with your kids

Simoneg, I read that you have been following this setup for a while. How much accuracy are you achieving. I know you would not be counting it but if you are following a risk reward of 1:3 or 1:2, then on an average ,out of 10 trades how many times your stop loss gets hit ?

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Thank you T!

I generally don't allow my stops to be hit. Most times when the setup is not working out. It is already clear and gives me enough time to curtail the loss. I have never sought out to measure win ratio. I just focus on the profitability of the system and its ability to keep me in low drawdown.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
there are 3 setups in this thread.

the entries were made based on the best buy/best sell setup. the other two were mentioned in post 1.

the answer in short is the sell entry was below both the best sell line and the best buy line. the best sell line was below the best buy line.

for further explanation read from # post 441 onward.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Thank you for answer. Clearer now..

--- 帖子 #659 ---
You make a really interesting point Simone about how setups occurring at one point in time can actually lead to a great trade entry quite some time later.

Looking back on my Euro H4 chart of Friday 12th October I see the latest short off was triggered from a line established in a setup from 12 days ago.

Hi bnsnla,

The only 123 setup on the EU Daily Right now is a bullish setup as seen below...This is the other 123 setup, which we need to see tested before taking. Please see attached chart.  Yes we could see a reversal, but I am more looking at trading the structure that exists rather estimating what will happen on an incomplete one.

I don't think so Ra

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Why is the upper picture shows that bar#3 closed below the open of bar#2 and the close of bar#1

while,

the bottom picture shows that the bar#3 closed below the close of bar#2 and the open of bar#1

In both pictures, the bar#2 is bullish so im confused when do you consider bar#3 to close below the open OR close of bar#2

Thank you

--- 帖子 #666 ---
just take note of bar 1 whether it is a bullish or bearish bar, and the picture will be clearer - bullish -> close, bearish -> open.

from post 1.
ideal SELL SCENARIO#1
Market is tending upwards (at least for 3 days).Uptrend - Creating Higher highs and higher lows.  The LAST BAR (BAR#3) closes with two bars having lower high on its LEFT BAR#3 closes below the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY) OR below the OPEN PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY).

Superb work on the indicator. A little feedback for you;

1) Show_Timeframe - Does not work when you change it from True to False

2) Show_Level Price - Does not work when you change it from True to False

Is it possible to get the text, that is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen to be placed to the right hand-side of the current candle as you had in your original indicator.

does not matter whether price moves up or down the setup, it is still valid and not cancelled because going forward price might revisit the setup line again.

the set up is only temporary ignored when price closes below a buy set up or above a sell setup.

New Version "sm3Candle BestLevelsMTF_v2.2"

Only a small correction:

- the parameter "maxBar" was not taken into account.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hi SwingMan,

I'm not sure why, but this weekly best buy level was missed on EU (week of Sept 9th).  This would be very important information for the LONG decision this week. Last Week's Weekly bar close also gave enough information to go long at this level, so that "old" level would be very relevant to the current trading range and week.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I'm trying to program the history.

Bet BUY Level is available in your Chart. Check the values.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I see the level for the current swing, but look at the Swing high next to the current. That's the one I'm referring to which would be history. I guess you're saying that you're still working on that?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Here is a first version with "historical" levels, and I think that for W1 the BUY level is displayed correctly (please test).

Currently only works for the current time frame.

For easier testing, set the parameter "Draw_UpperTF_BestLevels" to true or false.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Thank you SwingMan. Will do. I think you misunderstood my post. I was not saying that your W1 level was incorrect. I was just say that the level you now have marked in the new update was missing.

I thought your last version had addressed this issue.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
If I do not understand what you mean, that's no problem for me.

My wife has been saying for years that I can not understand the women ...

What on can do is e.g.

- to show only the last, or only the penultimate levels.

- or, if the last levels are displayed in the same way as in my chart, on should also draw the penultimate lines with lines to the right

- or on can draw the historical levels as a stair line

--- 帖子 #693 ---
The Last Option sounds more feasible SwingMan "draw the historical levels as a stair line"

OR

Consider making them W1 BEST BUY, W2 BEST BUY, W3 BEST BUY etc. If that can work. The principle is that:

the strongest buy level for the next few hours is the H1x BEST BUY that price is now at

the strongest buy level for the current session is the H4x BEST BUY

for the today Dx, for this Week Wx

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Stair line

Is feasible, but did not like you ...

H1x, H4x, D1x, W1x

To see better the levels, I think on have to draw the lines to the right edge. But on should not write any additional texts because on can not distinguish them!

I see that you need an additional upper level:

Example: (for H1) H4, D1, W1

Hi SwingMan,

I think what I'm about to ask maybe what you were saying in this post about an upper level. I think it is necessary to have 3 instead of 2 Upper Timeframes.

Much appreciated!

You can have allerts, I just ask which one.

At the moment I draw only lines in the sand ...

--- 帖子 #707 ---
I would like to have an alert for the 3 Candle setups when they occur SwingMan, and if possible, something like a dashboard to show the pairs that they are setting up on.

Not sure what other traders may require.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
- Everytime please mention the exact indicator name. I work on many things and do not always know what it is about.

Probably is the "SwingPoints" indicator for which one would like to have allerts. For a dashboard I have to understand what that brings, but currently I do not have much time to think about, just program ...

- I saw you mention the 123 pattern in #Post 700.

There is no clean pattern yet, because the 3 must be between 1 and 2, and the entry is at 2.

I have to program a small indicator for me, and to post in one of the 123 threads, because there are only ancient indicators.

If interested, later can I also post here the indicator and make a dashboard, because I apreciate the power of the 123 pattern ...

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Ok SwingMan...

1. For the sm3CandleSwingPivots Indicator - An alert when the setups occur. The dashboard only needs to highlight the pairs/timeframes with such setups.

2. Regarding your my post#700, I'm not quite sure what you are saying here SwingMan. There is a clear Pattern, even marked by your indicator for this system. The 123 Pattern is one and the same as the sm3CandleSwingPivots. The 123 that we trade here marks 3 as the Highest/Lowest Bar.

3. The dashboard request is for the sm3CandleSwingPivots only.

Thank you.

Good morning/evening Swingman. I think I prefer the lines for the old levels from your previous update. And yes, this representation in your chart is correct.

I think this should suffice for this indicator along with having one more upper timeframe.

Thanks again.

Simone

--- 帖子 #713 ---
New Version "sm3Candle BestLevelsHist_v2"

- You can consider up to three upper time frames.

- Note: if an upper TF is not needed, set to "current".

- The historical Best Levels are drawn for the current time frame.

The lines are drawn to the right edge, because sometimes the lines are too short.

The texts and the distance can be changed.

- In the next version, the historical levels will also be drawn for the upper time frames.

Please test.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
I like the option of setting the upper timeframe to current.

Much appreciated. Will be testing.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hi simoneg,

Personally I think leave out the history timeframe will be better otherwise the chart will look more complicated and confuse to some people. Just my view.

Shall leave it to you and SwingMan to decide.

Ron.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hi, Simoneg.

I would like to thank everyone.

I only have one question, the "sm3Candle BestLevelsHist_v2.ex4" indicator repaint? I'm sorry but I'm not very sure.

Thank you all.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Hi Ron

I thought about it being too much clutter, however, in my manual trading these levels have made a tremendous difference in making trade decisions. Maybe opting to turn on/off history would be more suitable so we have a win win. SwingMan?

--- 帖子 #718 ---
well said. Sound good.

Shall leave it with the original plan.

Thanks simoneg.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
If I invest a few hours to program an indicator and write "please test", then I believe that you can invest a minute to look at the settings and another 5 minutes to check them.

Now I'm not in front of the computer, but I think that you can turn off the parameter for history, or set the number = 1.

@geosevilla

If the indicator repainted or not, you should ask if you have determined this yourself, then post a chart and a comment. Then I can do something.

It may or may not be, I've posted the indicator, and asking about repainting an hour after my posting without testing, seems too early.

At the next indicator I will test for a week, and only then post here.

1. We are given the option to Specify what uppertimeframes 1 & 2 should be, however there is no change when you select an option outside of the default.

2. There is no Uppertimeframe 3

@SwingMan

RE sm3CandleBestLevelsHist V2:

Corrections:
1. We are given the option to Specify what uppertimeframes 1 & 2 should be, however there is no change when you select an option outside of the default. So I cannot, for instance, view only DAILY, WEEKLY and MONTHLY levels on an H1 Chart.

2. I think there is a slight issue in the code that sometimes causes a history level to be missed. Unfortunately I have to show you on a smaller TF for you to get what I'm saying. Please see attached chart.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
For those who are trading/learning the strategy. Please do not underscore the power of the HISTORY LEVELS. S&R is about "REMEMBERED PRICES".

Look at what happened to GU today for example. On the H4 it was a rejected History best sell and then on the daily there were 2 History Best Buys in the same regions. This gives us lots of information to take a high probability Long Trade OR Protect Profits On Short Trades.

What you can do is have two charts, one showing history and one without, to avoid confusion. My modest suggestion.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
You must set the "Auto_UpperTimeFrame_Setting" on false.

For missed lines I must test live.

Please post also other charts, and write please the pair name. I think your broker is Pepperstone, if not tell me this to have the same prices on testing. Some line values are identical with mines, other not.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Ok I will adjust that setting. Sorry, the pair in the previous chart was GBPUSD. Broker is Pepperstone.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Works great now with the Auto Adjust turned off. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #731 ---
hi simeoneg,

seem not to understand your entry/exit criteria,do you trade only on a particular TF or you take swing high/low on higher TF and enter on lower?

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Great work as usual on the indicator SwingMan .....

As Simoneg has mentioned to everyone the historical levels are there for a valid reason as price tends to remember where it was or went. Just be careful to observe fundamentals for the pair you trade because historical and current best buy/sell indications/levels can easliy be blown out of the water due to news.

Other then that keep up the good work everybody

Rafaz

--- 帖子 #733 ---
thank you, this little hint was important!

--- 帖子 #734 ---
so after swingman has posted great indicators and nearly the version with which we will work i will share some observation with you.

of course i call them only "observation" because i am very new to this trading approach and view on the markets, introduced by our very helpful simone!

on GU H1 i saw first the best sell monthly (red line) with first holding good support and then turned to a good sell spot (three highlighted circles)

then i saw the great SwingPoint- signal above the best sell weekly level (yellow triangle)

--- 帖子 #735 ---
or here GJ H1 chart observation:

the weekly best buy level was holding support, also the monthly best sell level was helping.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
and here the GC H4 chart obseravtion:

see how the H4 candles always closed below the monhtly best sell level.

could this be the next serious resistance?

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Hi, thank you for sharing, in case the candle close above the monthly best sell level then we can look for bullish PA for buy?

inmon

--- 帖子 #738 ---
GM/GN Everyone,

I don't think I have to say much more. Birdland's posts are very clear on how to approach trading the strategy as well as the tip from Rafaz.

@ SwingMan - I am very happy with the work that you have done on the BestHist Indi. I spent a lot of time observing the levels yesterday and matching against my charts. I will be trading on MT4 for the next couple of weeks. I didn't see any thing else apart from what I pointed out yesterday. So I think we can safely trade with these Indicators and provide any feedback as necessary.

Time to trade.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
i dont know yet because i am new to this strategy and will observe these lines/patterns and will draw my conclusion then.

but so far the indis give me a big clue where the market will go.

HI Simoneg,

Why is it my chart is different from your chart?

Mine was a long red candle and yours is a long green candle?

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Not sure you need the swing indicator because I think things are self-explanatory with what we have ... just my thoughts....and also the best/buy indicator already gives us that info already?

Also, this indicator does mean an increase in CPU as it is not a small file when you have many pairs open ....

I'd like to knowother people's thoughts.....

my own interpretation.

if this is a h4 chart:

1. if my entry is based on h4, then it would at close of bar 3 close above or below the set up line OR the retrace to the set up line and is valid candles later.

2. or i can drill down to h1 to do my entries after h1 close above or below the set up line.

If you missed it, forget it or wait for it. Sometimes we miss it folks

am I correct here? even if u scroll to lower frame after confirmation price never retraced to entry short??

Sorry Tony. Just seeing your post. Your snippet does not show a valid setup. 3 must have the highest high

this is my confusion here,,
http://prntscr.com/l7nri3

--- 帖子 #789 ---
oh sorry..i just checked and 3 has highest high 1 was 3 pips lower

--- 帖子 #790 ---
easy. nobody can make the decision for you.

if this is a retracement, either

1 you miss it.

or

2 enter above the candle close if you consider it close enough to the setup line, since this is a pin bar.

or

3 you eyeball yourself and consider whether that it is a 'good candle' above the set up line in lower time frame.

if you want to, the set up line can thus be considered a zone, not a single line. forex is not an exact science anyway.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Hi simoneg. I have been reading your thread with great interest. Your technique is really impressive and I say this after reading many other threads over quite a long period of time. I have to admit that I'm still having trouble understanding how to define the rejection areas(initially I thought they're simple support/resistance levels) but thanks to swingman's indicator I don't have this problem any longer. I would like you to comment on this short entry I just made on NZDUSD. I had doubts since this 123 pattern formed just above a d1/w1 best buy level. I looked then at H4 and I noticed that my entry is near and old h4 best sell level so this kind of encouraged me to proceed with the sell order. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Thank you emadmax! That's a great setup and entry. Those old levels give good hints as to whether the trend will continue!

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Good morning Simoneg,

I have a question I should have asked earlier.

The historical level calculations are they ;

1) based on the same time last year or

2) something else

so for example; historical best buy/sell  H1 is it based on same time yesterday/last week/last month/last year

historical best buy/sell  H4 is it based on same time yesterday/last week/last month/last year

and so on and so forth

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hi Rafaz,

Just about starting my day. I'm not quite clear on your question. These are specific levels. For instance the Best BUY is the Low of the Highest Bullish bar at a Swing high Vice Versa for the Best Sell. Hope I have answered your question.

the EU trade yellow line (daily history best sell) was drawn manually, right?

--- 帖子 #802 ---
To

Thank you birdland! Yes manually to avoid too many history lines on the chart. Thinking of a way we could improve on that aspect.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
yes i see also this problem. too many history lines clusters the chart. but some are very important, while others not. there will be still the need to add manually, important lines.

and the question is: which history lines are important and which not? i guess experience with this approach will give the answer...

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Yes birdland I still for now need to manually draw some history lines.

The ones I pay attention to are:

On higher timeframe. D, W, M

Where price reacted strongly

On the current timeframe (mainly h4 sometimes h1) I use them to add to my positions.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Hello Simoneg,

Let me simplify my question.

The historical level buy/sells, how are they calculated, so far H1, H4, D1 , W1 & MN1 how is it calculating these levels?

I don't understand from your last response.

Regards

Raf

--- 帖子 #806 ---
She had answered in post 807 that they are drawn manually.

They are eyeballed and drawn not 'calculated'.

For monthly, go to monthly chart and draw, for weekly go to weekly chart and draw, for daily go to daily chart and draw .....etc.

As for the indicator itself, non programmer would not have known how is it 'calculated', only the programmer would know.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
I'm not using any formulas to calculate anything Rafaz. The fractals already do that. I just put a line where the fractal structure says there is a pivot price.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
hello guys!

is this a potential setup?

http://prntscr.com/l82hnj

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Yes Tony it is. You can observe the PA at the entry price on H4 to make a decision.

what r some of the techniques you use on 4 hr? pinbar or inside candle to get in? any you recommend?

thanks

Taking profit here. Would have loved to see GJ close above Monthly and Weekly levels. Figure price will gap up on Sunday and continue. Who knows. Only sure of what I have now so to the bank.

Kindly be patient with me as I try to answer all your questions and and provide as much information as I can to help you get more comfortable with the strategy. If I don't respond to your message immediately I'm busy elsewhere. If I don't respond to your message at all I didn't see it.

Have a great weekend all.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Hi Tony,

I only find pinbars useful in telling me whether buyers/sellers are getting ready to reject a level. I pay more attention to the candlestick information rather than the pattern. As you review the trades we take here and going forward you will pick up additional bits of information along with what has already been shared.

That said, try to stick to the two basics that we are trading, the best buy/sell and the Swing Pivots. If I do not see those I do not trade.

Best

Simone

Hi SwingMan,

Can you please look into this?

I am doing some analysis on the GBPUSD MONTHLY looking at the most recent HISTORY LEVELS. I noticed that the HISTORY BEST BUY LEVEL which I have marked in yellow on my chart was not drawn.

Price Action Tony...that's all. How is price responding to the level.

Look at EU this Friday at the Daily History best sell on H1 and H4 Below (Yellow Line). What would you have done?

Then if you didn't get in early watch the H1 Response to the H1 Best Sell Later on in the last snapshot. Then other buying opportunities followed at the H1 History best buy levels.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
No Tony...I don't recommend that at all. Your risk would be much larger as we don't have enough rejection information to make a decision. That's why I posted that example for you yesterday. For you to see how price responds to a strong level. Even though it was a Best level scenario, we can clearly observe the PA in favor of a long trade. The principle is the same with the 123 setup.

Improve your entry and win probability by allowing price action to tell.

1. you have a d1 bar3 buy set up on oct 19.

2. on oct 22 if you intend to make your entry on h4, then wait for a bullish bar around the d1 bar 3 buy set up line. you have to decide how 'good' is the h4 candle.

3. on oct 22 if you intend to make your entry on h1, then wait for a bullish bar around the d1 bar 3 buy set up line. you have to decide how 'good' is the h1 candle.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
great!

i closed the first half of my position with +25 pips. important for psychology.

the second half i put my TP to best sell D1 level (1.15274)

BUT i will monitor the second half position in watching the PA carfully.

as a general rule i dont want to loose more than 50% of my profits.

and in deep i look how the price behaves around the h1 and h4 levels.

will they be rejected?

will they close below a history h1 or h4 level?

how do the bars look like, bullish versus bearish?

here comes the very discretionary part and unfortunately i havent found a general fix rule after all this years of trading.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Hi Tony,

In addition to the Exit Strategy I mentioned this morning. The 100-200pips tp is recommended based on the average size of the move that follows a SwingCandle setup on the H4 and Daily charts.

Just a note on the SwingCandle.

This setup usually hints big moves ahead. It is particularly helpful when it shows up on multiple related pairs and could mean a new trending move upcoming on those pairs.

Hope this adds some perspective.

I gotta ask you.....how do you come up with the TP of 1.2980????

thanks!

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Hi simoneg,

Nice thread you got going. Not many dare explain a reversal, those who do are not this concise.

Appreciate the reply. What am I missing? I've read the first several times over the last few days. Is this a different setup?

Let's go point by point.

ideal BUY SCENARIO#1

1. Market  is trending downwards (at least for 3 days). Downtrend - Creating lower highs and lower lows

Check.

2. The LAST BAR (BAR#3) closes with two bars having higher lows on its LEFT

Check.

3. BAR#3 closes ABOVE the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) OR above the OPEN PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY).

Check. As on the graph.

New Version "sm3Candle SwingPoints_v3"

Please test. Allerts, later.

I suppose we need only the arrows and the entry level lines.

I hope to have understood the entry rules:

- For a bearish 3 candle setup, entry should be at the Highest Bullish Open Price of the 3 candles.

(If all candles are bearish then entry should be at the Highest Bearish Close price)

- For a bullish 3 Candle setup, entry should be at the Lowest Bearish Open price of the 3 candles.

(If all candles are bullish then entry should be at the lowest bullish close Price)

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Thank you SwingMan! That sounds correct.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
SwingMan I notice you have two sets of entry lines marked...one solid and one dotted, why is that?

--- 帖子 #893 ---
The dotted lines are the entry levels just programmed.

I believe that the solid lines are the lines you need to identify the SwingPoints (your first posts).

Maybe you do not need them - have already written.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Ok, the dotted lines should completely replace the current solid lines. This is the filter that I added to this system and intended to send to you from the outset. So you can completely remove the "older" lines.  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
So essentially you're trading a slight variation of a fractal high or low. Or did I miss the point.

Hi simone

I have been reading your thread for the last week

I admire your work and perseverence. This system sounds efficient.

I have been trading for years with hedging strategies and looking for gaps.

You have booked 420 pips wow this is impressive.

I would like to know. A part from tge indicator that swingman worked on is there any other changes .

Still looking for 123 candles ?

Either reversal or rejection and trend continuation ?

How many pips on average you manage to book monthly

Thank you

thank you

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Hello, good people!

Trying to find a similar setup on SP500. Going step-by-step,

ideal BUY SCENARIO#1

1. Market is trending downwards (at least for 3 days). Downtrend - Creating lower highs and lower lows.

Check.

2. The LAST BAR (BAR#3) closes with two bars having higher lows on its LEFT

Check. It's low is 1 tick/pip lower than bar#2.

3. BAR#3 closes ABOVE the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) OR above the OPEN PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY).

Check.

Appreciate your input!

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Sorry guys I'm back and forth getting some things done today.

Tony your shot says best buy however I am seeing SwingPivot setup on your chart.

For the SwingPivot...I added a filter to avoid weak setups. So your LONG entry would have been at the open price of the Lowest bullish open in the SwingPivot.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Sure...Please see the attached chart. Price couldn't stay above the H4 History Best Sell (Yellow Line)

--- 帖子 #904 ---
That's a good setup HappyMan!

--- 帖子 #905 ---
We could see some reversals today folks. Trade carefully, some SwingPivot Setups developing on UC H1, now GJ H1 and GU prepping.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Thanks, simoneg! Means a lot coming from you.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
UC 1 hr ….swing pivot high and swing pivot lows in place

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Is okay, as I have supposed.

Now a technical problem:

- If a SwingPoint (3) appears on the last candle, it may disappear, then reappear, and so on.

- The entry line can be drawn and deleted accordingly.

- The Allert should send only at the next candle, after Close of candle (3).

Do you agree?

I think with the next SwingPoints version my work will be finished.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Hi SwingMan,

I'm trying to figure why the SwingPivot would appear and disappear. The only thing that you are changing is the entry line. That's all. Kindly let me know whether you are saying something else.

I did observe that SwingMan. Lots of downloads. Lots of "great job" comments. But no charts. It would be really sad to have such great help leave us guys!

--- 帖子 #915 ---
I do not have the rules in mind, but if the (changing) Close of candle (3) is above/below the Open/Close of candle 1 or 2, then there is or not the arrow (3).

Which pair is this Tony? At a glance I would say the high of the bearish bar that started that strong sell.

--- 帖子 #940 ---
just saw comment of swingman, very sad.

well hopefully people realize what they got here...its pure gold.

but the problem is that for many newbies the "best buy/sell levels" sounds too much complicated and hard work.

indeed the swingCandle indi (or 123 pattern from the first page) is very, very simple to understand.

i suggest start with this indi (or app, for the younger ones) and after a few weeks add the best buy/sell levels indi.

Hi swingman,

thank you for your effort. i noticed that on the screen shot some candles that are flagged number 3 don't refflect the scenario on Post 1 wich is in a bullish setup the 3rd candle close has to be higher than the first candle close and vice versa.

please see attachment

am i missing something ?

the second attachement shows the closing price of the 3rd candle above the closing price of the 1st one

does it mean that the setup is there as long as the closing is below the open price of the 1st candle for sell outlook ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Hi whitefox,

This version reflects a filter which helps with fakeouts and weak setups. I will be updating in post#1 as soon as we are done testing and finalised.

Hi All, what does it mean best Buy or best Sell ? To put an Limit Order at this Line H4 Line, or what are the rules, Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #956 ---
successful trading consists simple of three elements (and one more)

1) detection of support&resistance (trendline, fibonacci, moving average, round numbers, etc...)
therefore we are working here with Best buy/sell Levels.

2) correct interpretation of Price Action (PinBar, CandlePatterns, recection pattern, etc...)
therefore we are working here with SwingPoints (or call it 3-Candle)

for 1) and 2) ready indicators on the page#1 exist to download and to help the trader in their decisionmaking.

3) proper money management
to make things easy to understand: i suggest to risk max. 1-2% per trade.

and overall the most important part is a balanced personallity, the psychological part of trading.
trading is not a job, its a calling! if you dont fall in love with charts, forget it! do something else!
and dont trade to get rich! with this attitude you will get poor soon.
when you like your charts, indicators and your live, richness will come automatically to you!

--- 帖子 #957 ---
if one does not read the whole thread, then one does not have the faintest idea of what "best buy and best sell" are, as they are not mention in post #1.

and so be it because it does not take much effort to read a few pages if one really wanted and interested to know and explore.

may be i can help you a little bit. start digging from post #441 onward. i think that was where it started.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Thank you for your Statement. But this was not my Question. As we can see at this screenshot, it is an possible buy Signal, after close above the last two candles close. I ask, why should it be the best sell 4H Signal ?

--- 帖子 #959 ---
hello ,,,my lightshot isn't working atm,,,,can you draw the latest weekly pivots on UC,,,i just want to know if I have them correct? thanks!

--- 帖子 #960 ---
ok, when i understand you correct you are asking if the best sell h4 level can be a buy?

1) yes (when i understand simone correct) you can see both (best buy&sell levels) as a support&resistance (S&R)

2) on your chart shown there was no signal as we take them here. we mainly concentrate on the swingpoint signal (3-candle)

look at AU for example:

on the H1 chart you see 4 buy signals (3-candle) around the lowest hSell (h4)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

and when you look at the H4 chart we see 2 buy signals (3-candle). the last one was right at the hBuy (h4) level (blue dotted line)

and a clear double bottom also.

--- 帖子 #965 ---
i would suggest from your questions that its the best for the beginning to just buy or sell at or around the trigger-line combined with a h1, h4, daily or weekly best level. TP at 1:1 risk.

then after a few weeks, months you will get a feeling how far trends can go....hopefully;-)

so if the SL is about 15-20 pips then you will move your TP also to 15-20 pips.

ps: your links with charts are not showing anything, so useless for me

now lets do a trade realtime with a 1:1 risk/reward

i will buy GN h1 at the close of the candle. and a second position when the price pulls back to the yellow triggerline.

SL about 30-35 pips below the entry, TP 30-35 pips above

look at the best buy (W1) on h1 chart:

i am really amazed by the questions you have been asking.

i had previously shown you multiple times that you enter at the close of the candle.

no. you have not read page 1 carefully enough.

a picture paints more than a thousand words. from post #1.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
i have read page 1 over and over …i was under the impression that we had to wait til the retest of bar 1 to enter long on that example....and sometimes price never retraced to it.....

--- 帖子 #978 ---
so now you have 2 chances. one on candle close, the other on retrace.

so now you can better understand why there are 2 possible entries.

Hi All,

I have spent ,most of the afternoon reading the 50 pages on this very impressive thread. Congratulations for sharing your ideas and time. I think I got the jest of it but I will re-read some of the important posts over the week-end. I really like trading R/S, Pivots and S/D levels.

I have only one question so far...… Is there any instructions to setup the correct parameters of the indi? if so, could you please refer me to it?

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
great, welcome!

thats a good point, i am still experimenting with the correct parameters of the indi.

the swingpoint setup is easy, i hope you have no problems with it.

the best levels indi is tricky, because if you draw too many lines then you will clutter the screen with too many lines.

on the other side if you choose only 1 or 2 history lines then you will miss important ones.
at the moment i put in every day 10 history lines for each pair i am watching and then mark the important lines. then i turn back the setup to 2 history lines.

hope that helps...

--- 帖子 #990 ---

Thank you SwingMan! For the Past SwingPivot entry lines, consider that for instance a Bearish Swing Pivot could trigger a small sell, then price reverses, and closes above the entry line to give support to a buy = "Swing Pivot Rejection". So please don't invalidate them too early. Thanks again for the update.

Hi Swing man,

This correction was referencing the BestHistLevels Indicator, not the SwingPivots indicator. I thought I had that indicator name in the subject.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Ok, no Ver 3.3 would not be correct with a having a Signal after the close of bar 5. The last version is working fine so far for the SwingPoints.

By signal I was referring to the drawing of the best level line.

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
This indicator was very well thought out. Sadly, it is no longer working at all. I believe the problem is that it needs to be updated to work with +600 MT4 versions. Perhaps a coder will take a look at it. I don't think this indy will disappoint.

Hi tony1200,

Things to keep in mind Froggy:

1. The SwingPivot, by itself is more reliable on a higher timeframe...h4 uowards

2. Can be tested up to the Bar #3s high

3. Yields better results when it occurs at a Best Level or Fib 50%

4. It's not a 100% win system.

Hey Everyone,

I've updated post#1 with the latest versions of the indicators as well as the rules/guide for using them along with the suggessted settings. You may download and provide any feedback so we can request any corrections if necessary. There is still some work being done on the S&R (Best Levels Indicator) so please see the recommended settings for use.

I am also kindly asking the we only use these indicators on our charts as we post. NO OTHER INDICATORS PLEASE.

Let's keep our charts consistent with the system traded here.

Thanks!

Hi nschewgl,

I guess when I'm down you're up.

No problem if we see things differently. Every trade has to look at the market and make his/her own decision.

A couple of things. As it relates to how the market reacts, generally to S&R levels, consider the following:

1. Stall above support and bounce off support (buy)

2. Close below support (shake out) close back above and buy

3. Spike through support, close above and buy

4. Close below support, stall below (support now resistance) and sell

The truth is this is a monthly level that we have brought down to H4 etc. We are now at the end of the month. What will it be? 1,2,3 or 4. The monthly bar close will tell. While we may have some selling off the level, there's now a decision to be made for the next month. Let's see.

Additionally, monthly levels are more like zones, and price can move several pips out, while still respecting the levels. With weekly, daily and lower you have less of a  MOVE AWAY range.

That said, on the lower timeframes, we saw some buying and some selling, so both traders won. Let's see what the monthly close holds.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
GN/GM Everyone,

Having received some feedback from persons trading this strategy, I changed my level text to show SUPPORT & RESISTANCE, rather than BEST BUY & BEST SELL. The thought was that it would make it easier for traders to understand.

Please give your feedback on this so we can have a more collective opinion.

Thanks!

Also asking you to be patient, as we toggle with the best buy/ best sell levels indicator, we are converting from manual to 1/2 way auto so we are trying to get it as accurate as possible to make life easier. So there will be some back and forth until it looks like our manually set charts or close.

Birdland

I agree with you but I think EN HAS A LITTLE MORE TO fall so just be a little cautious as NZD is the strongest currency for the last 2 weeks.

Wait till the 4hr window closes at 2pm GMT and enter then .. maybe an option but it's entirely up to you

Hi,

Continue learning to identify the setup manually. Can I kindly request feedback on the following trade (SP500, M30, short).

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Hi Happy man,

The setup is valid however I do not recommend any lower than h1 timeframe.

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
Thank you, simoneg! Can you please elaborate your view on the preferred timeframes. H4 is preferred, no lower than H1. What about the higher timeframes? Also, what are approximate numbers of successful trades on each timeframe from your experience? The setup is surely valid, and I am trying to understand better its 'nuts&bolts'. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1101 ---

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
Hi there Simoneg,

Firstly, I would like to thank you for all what you are doing to help others. You have a great strategy here and I have actually gone through this whole thread page by page as I wanted to grasp as much information and not miss anything important. Tomorrow the market opens and I really keen and excited to try this out. I would like to thank birdland as well for his input. As I was reading through this thread I came across swingmans indicator. I use TradingView for my chart analysis, i noticed the indicator is for metatrader 4. Is there a way I can use this indicator on TradingView. I think I have a good understanding of the strategy now, I am only a bit confused about the Best Buys and best sells levels, so I thought this indicator would be really helpful for me.

Also do you guys think its a good idea to get a discord group going on where we can all share our analysis for this strategy. I would be happy to start it up and post the link on this thread. let me know what you guys think.

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
lots of H4 short signals with heavy overhead resistance are developing in pairs like GU, GJ, GA and GC.

good for +100 pips and more...

now waiting for the close.

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
now the winner is...nobody. thats why its important to wait for the close.

only GA made a shortsignal.

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
Hi JaySniper,

I'm not familiar with TradingView. Maybe someone else can give some insight on this. I am considering a group like that. Will see how it looks over the next few weeks. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
GM/GN birdland, market movements slowed in anticipation of US Midterms. Checking back in another hour/hour and a half to see what's happening and would like to see the next h4 close for much clearer picture. I am watching UC which is still holding the bullish h4 SwingPoint setup from last week and EURNZD which is down at H4 & monthly support

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Just got in to the UJ (USD/JPY) Short at 113.276, with my Stop just above the Swing High at 113.470, so only a 20-PIP risk.

Looks like a clear setup, so let's see how it goes.

(Point of information - The indicator shows an Entry level of 113.276, the Open of Bar 2, but based on the setup rules it should have been 113.271, the Close of bullish Bar 1. In this case, it makes little difference, but it might have done on other swing patterns.)

_____________________________________

Post Script: Most unusually, a good setup that failed, -19.6 PIPs ... I blame the US Elections! I should have known better than to try to trade while there are major US political changes going on ... too much of a risk factor.

I really like this strategy, but I feel like it is not very common to spot the perfect trade setup. However when they do come by, I feel like it pays off. I go through a couple of pairs as my daily routine before the London open, looking for that 3rd candle reversal opportunity. Does anyone else feel the same?

Also can some please explain clearly how to identify a trend continuation?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
eurusd  daily chart looks like a perfect setup right now, anybody alive in this group?

also people who have been using this strategy

what would you say the win percentage has been for you using this strategy?

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
yes on a daily chart the short signal is clear. i am short since yesterday from a h4 signal.

the winning percentage all depends how you set your SL, TP and your BE protection stops.

mine so far is +73% with all my trades since the start of this method.

most of the trades reach a 1:1 risk/reward and some are running quite nice with huge profits.

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
thats amazing, I have become pretty alright at spotting these reversals on daily now, I mean to be honest its not rocket science. I just need a better understanding on trend continuations. 73% thats amazing bro. I just took a short on eu lets see how it plays out. do you only use this strategy or combine them with others ?

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
i use different strategies.

this strategy i am still learning.

well, lets see how it works after 200-300 trades;-)

Potential Long entry on Cable (GBP/USD) at 1.2723 - see attached H4 chart.

I've got my stop set at 1.2703, just below the latest Swing Low, so a 20 PIP risk.

I'm aware that this is a higher-risk trade, as this setup has already yielded an 80 PIP profit the first time that level was hit yesterday.

Let's see what happens when New York opens in the next 25 minutes.

By the way, where is everybody? This thread has gone really quiet over the last two months.

I don't understand this, as Simone's trading system seems rock-solid to me.

It has great profit potential by finding high Reward : Risk ratio trades at Swing Low and Swing High points.

Is there anyone out there?!?

___________________________

POSTSCRIPT - Friday 11th January at 11:22 am UTC.

My Cable (GBP/USD) Long trade kicked in this morning UK time at 9:06 am UTC, at 1.27227.

Less than a couple of hours later, at 10:55 am UTC, I closed it at 1.28269.

Profit was +104.2 PIPs, ie over 50 PIPs an hour.

Reward : Risk Ratio on this trade was over 5:1!!!

Maximum drawdown during the trade was -13.1 PIPs ... ie virtually nothing

That's why I love @simoneg 's Daily Chart 3-Candle system!

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
i still like to use the setup described here, but i use only the daily, weekly and monthly levels.

the h1 and h4 levels cluster too much the chart with lines.

but the higher time frame levels are a great help and are my "line in the sand".

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
You make a good point @birdland about how the shorter timeframe S+R levels can clutter up the chart - I find this too.

You say you use only the Daily, Weekly and Monthly levels ... but do you trade only on these timeframes?

Or do you trade on, say, the 4-Hour chart using Daily, Weekly and Monthly S+R levels for guidance?

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
i trade most of the time the H4 charts from where i get the signals and sometimes the H1 charts, when i see a good setup.

but i dont use the H1 and H4 lines as a resistance or support described in this forum here. i use of course the daily, weekly and monthly levels.

so trading from H4 and sometimes H1 charts, BUT levels only from the higher ones.

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Hi simoneg,

Thanks so much for having shard this system.

I have managed to get hooked on to swing trading and also coded up some bots

using the concept behind 3 bar swing.

You are a star.

ciao

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
That's cool, birdland - sounds like you use the system pretty much the same as I do. The H4 charts are my bread and butter charts, trading off H4 setups within the general framework of the D1, W1 and MN S+R levels.

The 3-bar Swing Low / Swing High reversals are really reliable entry triggers, I find.

However, I note that the SwingPoints indicator does NOT indicate the correct entry levels. For example, the system rules says that for a SELL entry, the correct entry point is:

1. Bar 1's OPEN, if Bar 1 has a BEARISH body.

2. Bar 1's CLOSE, if Bar 1 has a BULLISH body.

The SwingPoint indicator indicates as a SELL entry point Bar 1's CLOSE, if Bar 1 has a BULLISH body - this is not correct.

The SwingPoint indicator also indicates as a BUY entry point Bar 1's CLOSE, if Bar 1 has a BULLISH body - this is also not correct, as the rules say the entry point should be Bar 1's OPEN.

I'll drop a note to SwingMan about this.

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
Hi candyman752

I am very interested to hear that you have coded up some bots using the 3 bar swing concept ... I'd be keen to hear more about these if you are OK to share?

I find simoneg's Daily Chart 3-Candle system gives very reliable entry signals from the 3-bar swing rules, and trade it on a manual basis at the moment. If there was a way of at least partially automating that using an EA, that would be very interesting.

Best wishes, loudoniii

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
Hi @birdland,

can you please confirm the remark by @loudoniii (#Post 1137)?

I can then check the indicator later. Unfortunately I have another project in progress now.

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Hi @birdland and @loudoniii,

if you have time, you can test an indicator, maybe that helps …

The fractals are drawn in Level 1 for 1 bar left and 1 bar right (=> Neptune's Trident … )

Then Level 2 for the position of the fractals for Level 1 (1 fractal left / 1 fractal right), and then Level 3 for the position of the fractals for Level 2.
(I'm not doing any further description here, you can find more in Lindsay's Trident-book, or later in a thread from me).

At the second bar after the fractal or for break out of the trendlines, you can define entrys.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
that might be the case, but i dont use them for my entry trigger.

the last time i used them-it was a few months ago-they did work well like simone described it.

so i am happy with the bestbuy/sell levels (or call them S&R) and use them only.

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
thanks SwingMan,

if i have the time i will check the thread from lindsay and test the indicator,

thx.

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
Hi SwingMan

Thanks for the opportunity to try out your new Neptune's Trident indicator ... I shall be happy to do so.

I'm not familiar with Neptune's Trident, so I will go and research it now.

Will give you feedback once I've had a chance to try it.

Thanks again for all your fantastic support to this thread!

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
From post #1

BUY SCENARIO#1
3. BAR#3 closes ABOVE the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) OR above the OPEN PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY).

so the sm3Candle SwingPoints v1 is correct. v3.2 had it the reverse way.
same for sell scenario.

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
Brilliant, Inthebox! I’m off to try to find v3.1 of SwingPoints!!!

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
I am currently testing it. Started in November last year. The test is appearing on my profile as trade explorer called bar 3 swinger.

The concept is solid so far.

Basically I just read through the thread and then tried to code the way simoneg said she trades it

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
Your indicator for Trident Trident looks really interesting, SwingMan!

I'm finding it very difficult indeed to find out any information on Charles L Lindsay's "Trident Trading" approach online.

I have found one UK supplier of his classic book on the subject, so have ordered it today.

I'm also experimenting with your SwingPoints V1 indicator on the same charts as your Trident Trading indicator, and find that the SwingPoint indicator often seems to indicate a new Long entry level at Point C (= P3?) within the ABCD (P1-P2-P3-P4?) pattern.

In other words, the Swing Low / Swing High  analysis of simoneg's Daily Chart 3-Candle system seem to be consistent with the principles of Trident Trading.

I hope to understand more about Trident Trading once i've had a chance to study Lindsay's book. If you are planning to host a forum or do some other online writing on Trident, I'd be very interested to participate in the forum.

Thanks again for all your positive ideas, and supporting indicators.

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
Hello every body!

I just learned about the daily chart 3 candle, looking forward to sharing with you about the best entry points of this method to get the best profit.

Thank you very murch!

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
Nice Long opportunity earlier this morning UK time on the Aussie (AUD/USD), based on a Daily BUY trigger at 0.70872.

I got in there with only minimal drawdown, and now have +30.2 PIPs in the bank so far, still going.

I locked in a couple of PIPs, so it is a free trade now.

Let's see what this afternoon brings.

By the way, in my current chart mark-up, I am using only the BUY and SELL triggers from the system, on Monthly, Weekly, Daily levels normally, with the occasional 12-Hour or 4-Hour trigger to finesse entry sometimes.

Works very well .. nice clean charts, very clear entry points and Stop Loss levels.

Thanks yet again, Simone, for sharing this great system with us all!

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
Which indicator are you using with the levels

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
I use no indicators - this is pure Price Action trading, in line with Simone's rules

i just manually mark up my charts in Metatrader 5 (MT5) , using all the principles of Simone's trading system here on Daily Chart 3-Candle.

I use the MT5 Fibo tool to mark up each level, as it allows me to annotate each level. This is nothing to do with normal Fibonacci, I'm just using the MT5 Fibo tool as a drawing tool, to mark up the various BUY and SELL trigger levels, as explained in the 1st Post in this thread.

Let me make it quite clear - I am using only Simone's BUY and SELL trigger level rules.

I am not using the Best BUY and Best SELL levels, as I find they just make my charts too busy, and more difficult to read. I am not using SwingMan's indicator either, for the same reason.

I find that if I simply use the BUY and SELL trigger levels, they show the exact best entry levels, and associated Stop Loss levels a few PIPs away from the nearest Swing Low for Long trades, or Swing High for Short trades.

A great example of this today, is the H4 No 1 BUY trade trigger level on the Loonie (USD/CAD) - this was worth over 130 PIPs for a Stop Loss of only 25 PIPs or so!

See attached picture of today's action on the Loonie (USD/CAD).

See also attached picture of how I use the MT5 Fibonnaci drawing tool to draw and annotate each BUY or SELL trigger level.

The %$ tells MT5 to include the price level also.

I just mark each trigger level for a given timeframe, eg H4 No 1 BUY for the 1st BUY trigger on the H4 chart, and so on.

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
Thanks for the feedback cheers!!!

No prob, Lando12.

I have Metatrader 5 (MT5) set up at a UK hosting company called Fasthosts, as a Virtual Private Server (VPS), a Windows server that is up 24 x 7.

This means I can log in to it any time from anywhere in the world, using the Remote Desktop free app on my Apple Mac, iPad or iPhone.

This lets me use my big screen and Apple Trackpad to do the basic chart markup when I’m at home, then update the markup while I’m on the move, using my iPad or iPhone, from which I can also place my trades, of course. I’m about to purchase an Apple Pencil for my iPad, to enable me to make precise chart markups, to the 5th decimal place of price.

It’s great to be able to benefit from the ease of use of Apple touchscreen devices even though I still have to run MT5 on a boring old Windows platform.

I use MT5 because it has other timeframes including H12, and it actually saves my chart templates with all the markup, unlike MT4 which keeps losing all my chart objects and doesn’t save properly.

Where is the Euro (EUR/USD) heading in this coming week, I wonder?

Last week it made a modest rise, despite all the European uncertainty over UK Brexit, the future of the European Union, etc.

Here's a 12-Hour chart of the Euro marked up with Simone's original BUY Rejection and SELL Rejection levels, on the Monthly, Weekly, Daily and 12-Hour timeframes, to show us some key Support and Resistance levels that will either be respected, or overtaken, depending how the market goes.

Let's see what next week brings.

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
Hi ! everyone!

I recently learned about Forex in the last few days and especially the swing points method. It is very attractive and attractive. I used demo accounts to practice above swing points method.

I just set the above method, there is interest. However, I have not effectively used the features of support and resistance points. I hope you share more hands-on experience!

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
Hi Simoneg!

I just studied forex trading. I am very impressed by trading Swingpoints method. I have set up according to your instructions on page 1.

I was embarrassed when determining the entry point.

1. As you can see from Figure H1, there are many swingpoints to enter the command. In your experience, at what point should we enter the command? for example, at swing high, swing low (bottom) or in the middle. How should we incorporate the support and resistance lines to enter effective orders?

2. In addition to the Swingpoints score you have shared. In your experience, is there a variation of Swingpoints that can be effectively exploited in transactions? For example: is H4 a variation of Swingpoints? hope you share more, if there is an image to illustrate, it is better.

Look forward to your reply!

Sincerely thank!

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
Hi Cloud33

Apologies for delay in replying ... I've been away.

The BUY and SELL rejection levels show major Support and Resistance levels on their respective timeframes: Monthly, Weekly and Daily. Post #1 on this forum shows you how to mark up the rejection levels on your charts.

I find that the most effective way to use the rejection levels is to show you where likely turning points are in the market, in other words, around these levels things tend to happen. For example, when price continues Long into a BUY rejection level, then the level shows you where price will meet significant resistance to going higher. So don't be surprised to see price turn back downwards off a BUY rejection level, as the name suggests.

,

This is no guarantee that price will do so, of course - if the bullish sentiment is really strong, price can break through the BUY rejection level and continue higher. This presents a good opportunity after the initial breakthrough to go Long off any backward retest of the level.

Exactly the same principles apply in reverse for SELL rejection levels, Just study simoneg's raft of examples in this forum to see how it works in practice.

To pinpoint the exact entry trigger levels, use the rules set out in simoneg's Post #1. You will find that these entry triggers usually occur around rejection levels.

To determine possible exit trigger levels, for example for Long trades, take care when price reaches the next BUY rejection level, and maybe treat this as a good point at which to take profits, or some profits at least. Same rule applies in reverse, of course, on SELL rejection levels when you are Short.

Hope this all makes sense - this trading methodology is the best I have seen in over 20 years of trading, so it is very worthwhile spending as long as you need in studying this forum and all its great input, especially those posts by Simone herself. Don't get hung up on the indicator that occupies a lot of chat later on in the forum ... stick to the basic rules and you should get great results!

Hi Siguake

I agree with you that it is best to plan your trades around the major Support and Resistance levels, the Monthly, Weekly and Daily levels. Personally, I find that marking up all these 3 timeframes' BUY and SELL rejection levels, as explained in simoneg's Post #1, provides a really accurate "ladder" of S+R levels.

However, in terms of finding the optimum trigger levels for entry, as long as you are working within the Monthly, Weekly, Daily S+R framework, I find that you can get some really accurate entry trigger levels from a shorter-term chart, usually the 4-Hour (no shorter!).

So when price, for example, bounces back down off a Daily BUY rejection level, you may find a good Short entry level from the 4-Hour chart, simply by following Simone's rules from Post #1.

These 4-Hour trigger entry levels give you trades with a beautiful Reward:Risk Ratio, as they offer very modest Stop Loss values, maybe as little as 20 or 25 PIPs, for a decent return, perhaps 75 or 100 PIPs.

Just study all simoneg's posts in this forum, particularly the first 20 or 30 pages, to see lots of great examples of such trades. The beauty of this approach is that it provides excellent profitability on all winning trades, while keeping losses well under control. This is a winning combination!

Hi anhthu049

Welcome to the forum!

To get the best results, I suggest you study carefully simoneg's basic rules set out in Post #1, then read all the example trades that Simone gives in this forum, particularly the first 30 pages or so.  Please see also my comments in the 2 posts above, which may help you.

Any questions, just drop us a line here and I'll be happy to help.

If you take the time to study this methodology, you will find it is excellent, in my experience.

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
Thank you for sharing and information. I am still studying the strategy above, I will read it carefully again according to your suggestion. Sincere thanks!

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
Hi-

I seen you have been using this methodology for a long while now,,,,have you logged your winners and losers? ( looking for a wins to loss ratio)

thanks

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
I have explored trading one of the above deals. However, I have not yet formed a rule for specific transactions. I do not have much experience in this market. Losing rate makes up the majority. How about you ? hope you share!

Dear Simoneg,

I am very excited to see your analysis, i am trading the similar method like you described in this topic xD.

It's great to see a guy think alike xD.

I wish we can discuss further more about this method to improve the trading results xD

Hello everyone,

Hello Dramti,

The ideal 123 looks like below. 3 always has the lowest low (for buy) or the highest high (for sell). Then it closes above/below the Open/Close prices of bars 1 &2. Use price action to help determine the strength of the entry price.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
Will the Euro (EUR/USD) bounce back from last week's selloff?

We have an H12 BUY trigger coming up, though it isn't perfect as Bar 3 does not close over the close of Bar 1, which is bearish.

Let's see how price reacts to this BUY trigger line.

A decisive close over the line? Or a clear rejection, and a continuation of the downtrend?

As always, we will believe only what we see, when it happens.

.

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
I've been using this method with astounding results for quite some time now, however I came to the conclusion that the perfect setups with Bar 3 closing over the close of Bar 1 (as seen on the far left of your chart) are significantly more reliable than entering later after the close of Bar 4 or 5. Lately I've been trading the close of Bar 3 exclusively, so I'm passing on the Euro until I get that perfect setup. At the moment I'm long NZDJPY and AUDUSD.

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
Cool. Yes, I agree about the great reliability of setups where the close of Bar 3 is higher than the closes on Bar 1 and 2 (or open of Bar 1 if it’s bullish) on Long trades, and opposite on Short trades. These are as close to perfect setups as we are ever likely to see.

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
CRACKER of a thred/method..so many variences when you look hard and think about it

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
hello semone, I have read all of your topics, thank you for sharing a very good method, I have learned a lot from this topic, I have some questions for your help.

- If Bar 4 is higher than Bar 2, must wait for Bar 5 to be higher than Bar 1?

- If Bar 4 is higher than Bar 1, there is no need to consider Bar 5?

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Hey Loudoniii, I was wondering, since the two of us seem to be the only ones left here trading this particular method, would you like to exchange WhatsApp or Telegram numbers so we can discuss our trades etc.? I think we would both benefit immensely from looking over each other's shoulder. I read that you have a similar approach to mine, in that we both manually draw the levels and look for the original buy/sell setups explained in post 1, although I stick mainly to H4 and H12.

What do you say?

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
I'm just starting this method, are there particular currencies you find more reliable/profitable?

Why do you use the h4 and h12 over the daily?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
Hi ctdthieu189,

Sorry I am just seeing your post. If you are referring to the 3-Candle System, the most important variables are:

1. Bars 1, 2 & 3

2. Bar 3 has a low that is lower than that of Bars 1 & 2 (Buy Setup) OR Bar 3 has a high that is higher than that of Bars 1 & 2 (Sell Setup)

3.  Bar 3 most close higher than the open and or close of Bars 1 & 2 (Buy Setup) OR Bar 3 must close lower than the open and or close of Bars 1 & 2 (Sell Setup)

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
I only trade the majors and this method works like a charm on all of them. I think Simone also trades cross pairs, though.

I do use the daily, but with a twist. The H4 timeframe is where I open my positions. The way I go about it is to identify the 123 pattern on H4, then I will switch to H12 and daily, look for the Best Buy/Sell level or Buy/Sell Rejection level and then I will open the position in relation to it. If I don't see any I won't take the trade. Hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
Yes Silverwater, I do trade some cross pairs as well such as GBPAUD, GBPCAD, GBPNZD & GBPJPY

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
Thanks! Would you be so kind and share the other cross pairs you like to trade?

Also, since you seem to be rarely online, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for sharing this amazing method. I say this without any exaggeration, with your help I only have a losing trade once in a blue moon. This thread is pure gold and I can't quite believe that you willingly shared all of this for free. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

hello simoneg,,

I have spent the past five days reading and going back over this wonderful method, it has been the most enjoyable read I have every came accross.

It looks as though I'll spend the next few weeks studying this material as it seems to be easy, very pleasant and a profitable method.

No questions as yet, but that may change any time.

From Australia- all the very best,

Thank you.

Thank you for answering the question, I am not wondering about candles 1,2,3 but questions about candles 4 and 5.

Can I ask you to identify the trend in a reasonable way for H4? I use 2 EMA50 and EMA20

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
Hi ctdthieu189,

I do not use indicators, my best recommendation is scanning the higher timeframe for a good gauge of the overall trend. So for H4 refer to daily.

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
Hello simoneg,

I have spent a fair amount of time going back over the setups, but only on the daily time frame.

What percent of accuracy would you give for this method. I'm asking this to see if I am missing out on some detail as I give the method an accuracy of 65%, which I believe is good..

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
hi simoneg please send me telegram link.

ciao

a side note. this system is best analysing on a daily chart and then going down to the lower time frames, once you have established the support resistance on the daily.

is this a correct trade?

do i have to wait #bar3 to close?

or i can trade when price break #bar1?

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
From post #1.
3. BAR#3 closes below the CLOSE PRICE OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY) OR below the OPEN PRICE
OF BAR#1 (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY).
4. Open a SELL TRADE OR SELL LIMIT at BAR#1's OPEN (if BAR#1 has a BEARISH BODY) or at the CLOSE (if BAR#1 has a BULLISH BODY)

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
One more Question

is this a correct BUY REJECT?

do i have to wait to new Bar1 to close?

or i can trade when its confirmed BUY REJECT?

--- 帖子 #1227 ---
From post #1.
Buying Rejection levels are found at the HIGHEST BULLISH CLOSE PRICE of a Swing Low.
4. If you are in a long/buy trade and price keeps failing (not able to close above) at the close price of the Highest Bullish Close Price of the Swing Low Structure, the market could be looking to go bearish, protect your trade or take profits. Otherwise, stronger buying ahead.

My own interpretation.
Buy reject when the next candle is unable to close above the line.

--- 帖子 #1228 ---

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
Hi everyone,

Coupled with the fact that I am not on FF every day, I would like to strike a balance as we open this free group.

1. It requires you have a good amount of trading experience. Reasonably 1 year.

2. It requires that you are already trading the best level and 3 candle systems, which you will only come to improve on in the group.

3. It is not a signal service, traders are only sharing their ideas.

If you feel happy with the above. And can truthfully say yes to all, let's go! Send me a PM and I will send you the link to the telegram group.

Blessings.

Simone

they are valid if price returns to the level, even candles later.

example
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post11038376

the level is to be drawn at candle 1 and not candle 2 as shown in your examples.

in your last picture, the level is on the close of green candle 1 for swing high short,

and the open of green candle 1 for swing low long.

Still having issues with SL. Can I be guided on money management please?

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
i am trading since more than 30years and still have issues with SL. so dont worry, its part of the game. its a psychological thing that u have to cope with. over the years u will learn it...or not. then u will be dropped out of the game like 98% of the people here. its a natural process of only the best will survive. only a handful will be turtles out of 1000 eggs. the same is with trading and u have to be aware of it.

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
Ok, thanks for the words

Now maybe someone can share with us their ideas about moving initial SL during the day after the BE?

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
this is apart from this thread.

there is no right or wrong way of placing trailing stops.

just sharing ideas with 2 options out of many. the example is a trending one.

1. fractals - when the lower fractal is taken out, stop loss above the upper fractal ..... until taken out.

2. moving average - exit when candle close above the moving average. 2 averages shown, one shorter, the other longer.

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
Am i correct on this one? 4 is the trigger line and 5 is the support or rather best buy level

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
Since am still learning this strategy i want first to be cleared on the basics then i will advance to the levels(best buy and best sell/ S/R

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
And this?

Review and advice. Still want to do it manually then i will be updating with indicators that were given at the start of the thread.

--- 帖子 #1276 ---
Trade history for last week

--- 帖子 #1277 ---
4 swing low buy is correct. 5 is swing low best sell instead of best buy. it was a powerful buy level with the combination of the two methods when candle closed above the 2 levels.

post 1276 correct for both. notice that there were 2 chances each. one at close of candle 3, the other when price came back to the level. entries could also be taken at a lower time frame candle close.

post 1277. the 123 method is correct. as before, the best buy, best sell, you had them in reverse.

below is a summary of the 3 methods i had made sometime ago.

if you are confuse on the best buy best sell, it can be interpreted as:

Swing high Best Buy is at highest Bullish bar low

Swing low Best Sell is at lowest Bearish bar high

1 can be found from post 441 onward. 2 and 3 can be found in post 1.

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
You made it simple for me highly appreciate.

What kind trades are taken from the best buy and sell levels. Can we buy and sell on these levels or we sell on best buy level and buy on best sell level?

What kind of trades are taken from the best buy and sell levels. Can we buy and sell on these levels or we sell on best buy level and buy on best sell level?

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
my own opinion.

trade them according to the name. if one wants to trade the opposite way, it has to supported by other factors eg. trend, along with another method.

like in post 1275, there was a 123 buy and also best sell. there was somehow a conflict but price finally cleared above both levels.

not that the best sell cannot be traded. those experienced traders can still sell in smaller time frame but one has to adjust smaller expectations according to the smaller time frame.

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
Thank you for your prompt response. Will trade them according to their name

Did you backtest this idea with algo?

how is your trading performance with this system?

How much Winrate you got with this system?

--- 帖子 #1305 ---
although not necessary, here's a couple of tools that I give a nod to for gauging volatility and momentum, when using this method.

Euro FX VIX ($EVZ)
Euro FX VIX Price - Barchart.com

A $EVZ reading below 6.5 is low vol.

TMAslope within 1 and -1 is a ranging market [ Daily chart ]. With a eintPeriod = 10 and atrPeriod = 10

--- 帖子 #1306 ---
Really? Do you think the number of candles or closes is the most important thing? How about Price Action?

Simply look at today's close, is it above, or below the close of the previous 2 days?

That's it, 1 - 2 - 3, maybe 4 or 5 depends on the market

See this chart for examples

Keep this thread going Pleasssssssse

I'm working on a close recognition of something similar to this, and also along the line of Demark counting but way simpler. Using the Highs and Lows as more important levels than purely the Close, however.

Here are the "rules" or guidelines,

4 Bar Fractal Indicator

The 4-bar fractal is a simple measure of a turning point. It is mechanical, so it is easy to explain and easy to implement. It is reliable, but don’t expect miracles. It will catch some sustained trend moves, but you will also have your fair share of small losses and small wins because you get stopped out.

As the name implies, it is composed of 4 candles (or bars). It works in any time frame. The longer the time frame you are viewing it on, the more of an impact the signal is likely to have.

Buy Signals
(1) The CLOSE of the current bar (1) must be higher than the HIGH of the previous bar (2)
(2) The CLOSE on this bar (1) must be higher than the HIGH of the bar three bars back (4)
(3) If those conditions are met, we have a BUY SIGNAL

Sell Signals[/color]
(1) The CLOSE of the current bar (1) must be lower than the LOW of the previous bar (2)
(2) The CLOSE on this bar (1) must be lower than the LOW of the bar three bars back (4)
(3) If those conditions are met, we have a SELL SIGNAL

And using the same chart, no excuse for missing out if you are slow to enter  even an Inside Day there if you like those

very cool, thanks for sharing that Erebus!

makes sense, given the liquidity that may exist above/below the highs/lows, as opposed to just the close. I'll being checking it out in my charts...thanks again.

....outside my typical trade window, but here's one (UJ) that caught my eye today. It coincidentally dovetailed with the 3-candle method, in this case anyway.

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
I'm looking at the concept of entering with the 4 bar fractal and using the next lower time frame 4 bar fractal (opposite direction) to negate the trade...interesting so far..could go two time frames lower for tighter stop; but might need a re-entry rule for your model..

yea brother, im too trying to be added in the group.

the most simplest yet powerful strategy.

Sad that this thread is not active.

would love to be added in the Telegram group too.

the telegram group is since years already inactive, sorry guys.

Oh bro sad to hear that.

Shall we talk about this strategy bro if you can find the time ?

--- 帖子 #1330 ---
Thank you for answering us in the meantime, if I may ask you ... is it no longer active because like almost all strategies fail?

I would be very sorry ...

--- 帖子 #1331 ---
This trading method is highly effective and has been for a large number of years but it was originally designed for the daily charts- maybe the reason why the method has failed some. GO BACK and read page one and keep reading page one until you stop bending the rules.

Caught this trade this morning

GOLD SELL SETUP 1HR TF.

So Simple and easy strategy, bless you Simoneg.

Already taken partials, I expect to drop more as there is no strong resistance atm.

Is there any way to connect with Simoneg ?

i am not trading anymore simonegs style, sorry.

it can work great, but for me i found other things work better.

what i use from her approach still are the S&R lines he describes in this thread. but only on H4 and daily. they are great.

Closed with small profit as it is not able to break the resistance.

--- 帖子 #1346 ---
Hello everybody,

Most of the time, supports and resistances in crypto markets are not passed step by step as in forex. So if the stochastic comes from the bottom and gives a buy signal, I do not wait for the candle to close. I also use the Fibonacci levels to determine the take profit level. I draw a fibonacci retracement level from the close of bar 1 to the low of bar 3 and set the take profit level as 2.618. Then he can go to space. Does not interest me. I wanted to share with you.

Thank you.

Thank you for a good thread n strategy and all your efforts. A chart representation of exactly what you outline would be welcomed.

--- 帖子 #1351 ---
Interesting thread, but unfortunately, it’s stopped. Is anyone still using this system and providing updates?

--- 帖子 #1352 ---
Great question, over 1,300 posts for a mechanical trading system and still no definitive answer for how to use it?

You may as well go and join this thread where they are still searching for those very answers, good luck.

PS: Also, great if you think that numbering candles is a great idea.

--- 帖子 #1353 ---
simple, very precise, concrete set up. can be used in swing and long trading (H4,D1). and of course scalping/swing(H1).

thank you for sharing brother. hope you still around and in good shape.

those who understand this strategy will be able to gain++++++++++++++++ nothing less.
% HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

note: i dont need to put things in here just to prove that this strategy or set up is very effective.

anyways... for your eyes only. its all in the first post but just to cleared up your mind again i have this formation. guess which directional bias win, up or down? or is it a continuation?

if you say up/reversal (no), then you are wrong,

if you say dn/continuation =yes, then you are right. ICT or SMC will come to play with this with their buy side liquidity/break of structure and so on.

but on the part of set up, its only the TFs to be monitored (D1,H4 & H1) nothing more.

I found this thread as I was searching for 3-Bar Reversal Pattern with no success, not popular it seems.

The charts on this thread seem subjective and hard to read.

Anyway, here is what professional indicator shows.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1358 ---
yes, its a bit hard to read from the start and it takes time to understand, even if we add the close below or above, market will tend to break it the opposite way. as shown below image.

with bollinger bands price is/was at the bottom band already. if we look for buy opportunity we loss. and if we take a look and analyze the bar #3 price not close above previous high.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

if we add bollinger band we can easily identify the direction with the 3 candle or 3 bar formation. heres the good and bad example of the 3 Candle as shown below image.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

and another 3 bar formation that will give us the idea and we can easily read the chart and predict the movement of PA.

based on my research and a lot of testing, still we can find strong reversal by using the 3 bar formation (the Reverso Power Bars) as shown in image.

where price breaks the old highs and reverse to form the opposite bar against the two previous bars .
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

if we look for sell entries the two previous bars should be bullish and #2 bar should break the high of the previous bar, and in the same manner the #3 breaks the high of the #2 bar either we closed below low or not as long as it will form a bearish bar. but theres an addendum to this with a strong force for the sellers as shown in image. in the image for strong reversal we can use the wick for this instance (the upper wick).

and the opposite if we look for buy entries the two previous bars should be bearish and breaking previous lows and #3 bar should be bullish

ill give you an example from my chart with the 3 candle and the pattern i used also for reversal and/or continuation. in the image below the (the Reverso Power Bars) is/was in the continuation mode. added on the chart is the bollinger bands.

Thanks for pointing all of those things out, but even with being subjective, it seems that you have enough criteria for those conditions to be programmed, have you thought of that?

I used the example that I posted purely because it was the most recent daily, and to see where it went, nowhere so far.

This indicator has many selectable filters, with trend by 3 parameters, opposite trend, as well as option for close beyond the 1st bar or not.

I'm still experimenting with it, but in case you didn't notice, price action has been very tough since late last year, and this week was not no different, can you name any pair developing a daily trend?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1361 ---
i dont know if this pair fits in, BTCUSD.

in the case of Bitcoin now and at the stage of disrespecting the discount zone but not closed below low, as price of the day was disrespecting the old days, take a closer look on the old lows (Respecting the discount level) (see as shown in image) the next day (today) price will tend to climb up looking for a place for price to get into (either we find rejection or respecting those levels at the premium zone of the previous day for continuation down? or disrespecting those to reverse again up.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

if we take and look at the hourly chart with Premium and Discount zones. is there any PD Arrays for price possibly respecting those and go down or possibly disrespecting those and go up.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

and if we take and look at H4, what we have got at P or Premium zone? a FVG or Gap, but the question is, is price will take that gap by touching it and go back down? or after the current 4-Hour will leave behind new gap where the gap possibly be taken or touch or respecting by current/next 4-Hour bar?

--- 帖子 #1362 ---
I hope you didn't think I was implying that 3-Bar Reversal is the Holy Grail, of course, there are many failures, each trader must decide which signal to trade according to the market structure at that time.

When you post a chart going forward, can you please reveal the pair and date so that I may compare with this indicator?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1363 ---
oh sorry sir Erebus, heres the daily chart of BTC with date

--- 帖子 #1364 ---
of course not sir. im not and never think of those holy grails. its the trader's choice to decide which signal to trade according to his/her trading plans.

--- 帖子 #1365 ---
Not something that I trade, only observe, looks like I can redraw my triangle on Tradingview, I didn't realize that it also took a dump on Friday, the whole chart shows what I said earlier, market has not gone anywhere all year.

And the is 3-Bar signal on Daily, the other colored highlights are Inside Days

And the 4-Hour, it was already on an Inside Week, and this week no breakout success.

--- 帖子 #1366 ---
my indicator and yours are similar. we have the same signals from daily to H4 more likely down to H1.

from daily signals its not tradable actually coz its an inside bar in daily and same in the weekly.

if we have to scalp with can use lower time frames using the same tool.

--- 帖子 #1367 ---
Only just found this on further research, looks great, and FREE

Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #1368 ---
yes, a bit similar to what i use now. on the video he uses many confluences for support. in my case i used SMC or ICT PD Arrays. with that if a signal is formed either of the zones Premium or Discount plus ++ the available PD Arrays which comes first that gives us confirmation with the tools we used.

--- 帖子 #1369 ---
Thanks For Sharing .

Brother Please provide these two indicators MT5 version .

Thanks.
