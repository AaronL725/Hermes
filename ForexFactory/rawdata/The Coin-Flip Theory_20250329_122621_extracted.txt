The Coin-Flip Theory Hello everybody, I would like to tell you something about this strategy http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=494447 (more a system, because there is no MM included etc.) I am a student 19 years old, I study economics. I traded demo since my 16th and real when I was 18 years old. I saw alot strategy's and systems, made my own out of others and after alot tweaking it was finally done. It made and still does make a steady x% monthly. Everyday I had to do the same thing preparation mental, read somewhat about the news upcomming (I trade technical); this got me bored. I still liked trading alot don't get me wrong. Then I read this thread about a month ago, http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...444377&amp;page=79 from a mathematical standpoint it is fairly easy, but in practice it is really hard as always often with mathematical things. I really love to make things work so I began to search for a basic working system for this, made my own out of others (what I really recommend for beginners after they read everything at Babypips). Now I am going to tell you why I am posting this here. My system for Rags to Riches is almost the same as what OP posted here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=494447 . The rules: - Trade on the hourly on major pairs, I only traded EUR/USD - Trade @ the second candle after the opening of the London session (so you don't get disturbed by opening breakouts). - Close the trade @ opening level of the candle - Open the trade @ closing level of the candle - Buy when the candle is Bullish - Sell when the candle is Bearish - There is no TP level - SL is yesterdays high or low(depends on if you are selling or buying ofcourse). Something more about the SL. I have a EA that closes the trade and not a set in stone SL incase the broker stop hunts (what I think they don't do but you never know). The EA closes the trade when a candle closes above/below yesterdays high/low. So it doesn't close the trade when it spikes in the range and retraces. Because it is a really risky system you can start with a really low bank. I started with 100$(one trade is the whole bank), almost everyone in the trading business can afford to lose that and if you can't you shouldn't trade at all. I traded with a super high leverage 1:2000. This is not needed but I did this to see how I would react. You need to have nerves of steel if you want to trade with 1:2000. Because this is over leveraged I can't just use the normal SL rule. My DD must be 50% in order to work with 1:2000 so I can only afford to lose 34 pips (5 digit broker, spread is 5-8 pips, commission is more then average when you make winning trade but zero when you make a losing trade so that’s really nice!) I said to myself to use this rule after I got 500% growth because I thought I would never make it. The results : From 17-June till Today Leverage 1:2000 Start with 100$ Sell Day 1: Open 1.35619 Close 1.35531 Gain: 88 Pips 88 Pips x (0.00001/1.35531)x(100$ x 2000) = 129$ +100$ = 229$ Buy Day 2: Open 1.35570 Close 1.36375 Gain: 805 Pips 805 Pips x (0.00001/1.36375)x(229$ x 2000) = 2703$ +229$ = 2,932$ Sell Day 3: Open 1.36349 Close 1.36103 Gain: 246 Pips 246Pips x (0.00001/1.36103)x(2932$ x 2000) = 10,598$ +2703$ = 13,530$ Sell Day 4: Open 1.36023 Close 1.35803 Gain: 220 Pips 220Pips x (0.00001/1.35803)x(13,530$ x 2000) = 43,837$ +10,598$ = 54,435$ Sell Day 5: Open 1.35764 Close 1.35798 Gain: -34Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.35798)x(54,435$ x 2000) = -27,257$ +544,35$ = 27,178$ Sell Day 6: Open 1.36197 Close 1.36088 Gain: 109 Pips 109Pips x (0.00001/1.36088)x(27,178$ x 2000) = 43,536$ +27,178$ = 70,714$ Buy Day 7: Open 1.36028 Close 1.36230 Gain: 202 Pips 202Pips x (0.00001/1.36230)x(70,714$ x 2000) = 209,707$ +707,14$ = 280,421$ Sell Day 8: Open 1.36138 Close 1.36172 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36172)x(280,421$ x 2000) = -140,210$ +280,421$ = 140,210$ Sell Day 9: Open 1.36115 Close 1.36149 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36149 )x(280,421$ x 2000) = -140,210$ +280,421$ = 140,210$ Sell Day 10: Open 1.36527 Close 1.36561 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36561)x(140,210$ x 2000) = -70,105$ +140,210$ = 70,105$ Buy Day 11: Open 1.36886 Close 1.36852 Gain: -34Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36852)x(70,105$ x 2000) = -35,052$ +70,105$ = 35,052$ Buy Day 12: Open 1.36555 Close 1.36521 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36521)x(35,052$ x 2000) = -17,526$ +35,052$ = 17,526$ Sell Day 13: Open 1.36515 Close 1.35881 Gain: 634 Pips 634Pips x (0.00001/1.35881)x(17,526$ x 2000) = 163,547$ +17,526$ = 181,073$ Buy Day 14: Open 1.35879 Close 1.35981 Gain: 102 Pips 102Pips x (0.00001/1.35981)x(181,073$ x 2000) = 271,847$ +181,073$ = 452,920$ Sell Day 15: Open 1.35953 Close 1.36987 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36987)x(452,920$ x 2000) = -226,460$ +452,920$ = 226,460$ Sell Day 16: Open 1.35928 Close 1.35962 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.35962)x(226,460$ x 2000) = -113,230$ +226,460$ = 113,230$ Buy Day 17: Open 1.36123 Close 1.36337 Gain: 214 Pips 214Pips x (0.00001/1.36337)x(113,230$ x 2000) = 355,460$ +113,230$ = 468,690$ Sell Day 18: Open 1.36237 Close 1.36127 Gain: 110 Pips 110Pips x (0.00001/1.36127)x(468,690$ x 2000) = 757,467$ +468690$ = 1,226,157$ Sell Day 19: Open 1.36039 Close 1.36073 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36073)x(1,226,157$ x 2000) = -613,078$ +1,226,157$$ = 613,078$ Sell Day 20: Open 1.36210 Close 1.36040 Gain: 170 Pips 170Pips x (0.00001/1.36040)x(613,078$ x 2000) = 1,532,244$ +613,078$ = 2,145,322$ Total Gain: 2594 Pips Growth: 429,060% Sell Day 21: Open 1.35968 Close 1.35426 Gain: 542 Pips 542Pips x (0.00001/1.35426)x(2,145,322$ x 2000) = 17,171,954$ +2,145,322$ = 19,317,276$ Sorry for clutter based out of Excel. The conclusion : I did this with real money because it is only 100$. The second day my nerves were tested to see almost a margin call is not fun after that I was full of joy the first days, ofcourse, but the 5th day I shit my pants. To see such big DD(I knew it before I started but still....) and especially with large sums of money its so painful. The world stops for a moment. So my first reaction that day is to pull all the money of it. That was still a big deal 27k. I still continued it on paper to see if I was lucky, to see the pros and cons etc. It was a big gamble. I wouldn't recommend it but you will learn a big lesson, to see how you react and how emotional driven you are in such situations. Then it is really worth the 100$. What also is worth mentioning is that a system is not everything but a strategy is. As you can see the entries are almost the same as a coin flip. But what you can do with good SL and TP, with support and resistance(yesterdays high/low). Cut your losers and let your winners run. Use a leverage what you can handle, good MM etc etc etc. Maybe ill start an account on a broker with lower leverage like 1:200 and that allows a Forex Factory Explorer Green pipping to everyone

Hello everyone, Sell Day 21: Open 1.35968 Close 1.35426 Gain: 542 Pips 542Pips x (0.00001/1.35426)x(2,145,322$ x 2000) = 17,171,954$ +2,145,322$ = 19,317,276$ As you can see with this high leverage your risk is lower then your reward. But because you can only lose 34 pips, (3.4 Pips for 4 digit-broker) plus the spread it is almost impossible. But if you go 10 factors lower, 1:200, your SL will be arround 340 pips (34 Pips for 4 digit-broker) and you can search for yesterdays high/lows etc. Because I think the market is only built on physiological interactions, its all about the mind of people who buy and sell. So resistance and support are key levels thats why yesterdays high/low is so important for this strategy. I will give you an example at sell day 5 where it went wrong. The results realistic point of view : From 17-June till Today Leverage 1:200 Start with 100$ Sell Day 1: Open 1.35619 Close 1.35531 Gain: 88 Pips 88 Pips x (0.00001/1.35531)x(100$ x 200) = 13$ +100$ = 113$ Buy Day 2: Open 1.35570 Close 1.36375 Gain: 805 Pips 805 Pips x (0.00001/1.36375)x(113$ x 200) = 134$ +113$ = 247$ Sell Day 3: Open 1.36349 Close 1.36103 Gain: 246 Pips 246Pips x (0.00001/1.36103)x(247$ x 200) = 89$ +247$ = 336$ Sell Day 4: Open 1.36023 Close 1.35803 Gain: 220 Pips 220Pips x (0.00001/1.35803)x(336$ x 200) = 109$ +336$ = 445$ Why SL rule works with -340 Pips Sell Day 5 Example : Open 1.35764 Close 1.36104 Gain: -340Pips -340Pips x (0.00001/1.36104)x(445$ x 200) = -222$ +445$ = 223$ Total Gain: 1359 Pips Growth: 223% (44,6% a day average) You still have a nice 50% DD but the problem is that you won't gain over 50% a day. So if you won't gain more then 50% a day you are done after 7 losing trades in a row (then you are back to 1% of your capital before the 7 losses). Maybe you think 7 losses in a row is almost impossible to occur but thats not true. Before I traded I was really into the casino game roulette, hence my avatar, because you work with alot of statistics and I love that(never gambled real with roulette). All of you probably know the Martingale strategy and that in the long run it always fails. Read about it here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system ) Because the entry is like a coin flip you can easily use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_fallacy : http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/2...2d1c8dd3df.png . The Gambler's Fallacy means that when people lose like 10 times in a row and then they think next time I will and must win, but with the coin flip the chances are still 50%. One trade will have 50% chance of winning or losing the next day the new trade will have the same winning chance but 2 losing trades have a 25% chance to occur. What most people think is that after alot of loses the next must and will win but this is wrong as stated above. Losing 7 times in a row has a 99.9% chance to occur in 500 trades. That can be in the last 100 trades when 1% is still a big chunk of money but this can ofcourse also occur in the first 100 trades when 1% of the capital is not even a penny. In reality it is different because you will use some real market analysing and not a random set in stone SL. You will work with support and ressistance, yesterdays high/low and that is where al the money comes from. A not very difficult to understand procedure and practical to use. But when the support or resistance levels are out of range of the 340/34 pips unfortunately you need a set in stone random SL but this doesn't occur that much. Sell Day 5 Reality(See screenshot) : Open 1.35765 Close 1.36100 Gain: -335Pips -335Pips x (0.00001/1.36100)x(445$ x 200) = -219$ +445$ = 226$ DD of 49% and that is below 50% and thats what we need. This is not a really good example but I hope you get the point. As this is still not a really realistic point of view because we have 5 days here and you can't base anything on that. I researched last 5 months and my conclusion is that: Total trades: 114 We got 61 trades won. 53.5% We got 53 trades lost. 46.5% - We got 22 trades stopped out by 340 SL. 41.5% - We got 31 trades stopped out by key levels. 58.5% At last I want to tell you that how more trades you will make how better you get to the 50% ratio. So as you can eliminate the 50% losing trades by using technical market analysis, the support and resistance levels etc. You are a winner because if you think in different way, the eliminated loses that are not a 50% DD but 40% DD are your winning trades. Think about that. Green pipping to everyone

Hai Which broker did you get 2000 levarage and take your profits out.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Exness you got 1:2000

--- 帖子 #6 ---
My questions are, what will happen if you get ten consecutive losses? When market is in ranged mode, many doji's, what you will do?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Powerful story. Did your broker really pay you the 19 million or was it a hypothetical example?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Jysticim your pips are out by a factor of 10. 1.35 23 5 1.35 33 5 This is 10 pips difference not 100. Keep up the good work though.

@ Forexgogo See the chart, I hope you understand it. @PipPirates 10 consecutive losses and then we talk about the set in stone SL losses probably won't occur because we use market analysis(support and resistance). I researched the last 5 months and we only get 2 50% DD losses in a row. So 2 losses will give you DD in total of 75% wich you can easily recover from. For example Buy Day 7: Open 1.36028 Close 1.36230 Gain: 202 Pips 202Pips x (0.00001/1.36230)x(262$ x 200) = 79$ +262$ = 341$ Sell Day 8: Open 1.36138 Close 1.36205 Gain: -67 Pips -67Pips x (0.00001/1.36205)x(341$ x 200) = -33$ +341$ = 307$ Sell Day 9: Open 1.36115 Close 1.36333 Gain: -218 Pips -218Pips x (0.00001/1.36333 )x(307$ x 200) = -98$ +307$ = 209$ Sell Day 10: Open 1.36527 Close 1.36595 Gain: -68 Pips -68Pips x (0.00001/1.36595)x(140,210$ x 200) = -20$ +209$ = 189$ Buy Day 11: Open 1.36886 Close 1.36891 Gain: -95Pips -95Pips x (0.00001/1.36891)x(189$ x 200) = -26$ +189$ = 163$ Buy Day 12: Open 1.36608 Close 1.36543 Gain: -65 Pips -65Pips x (0.00001/1. 36543)x(163$ x 200) = -15$ +163$ = 148$ In these 5 losses with no market analysis you would have a DD of 96.8% But in reality you have a total DD of 57% wich you can easily recover from as shown above. You can also look at it differently. You can easily double/tripple you starting bank and if you do so you just get the 100$ of it and you are trading with free money. What ever happens you will will never lose. As for the question about ranged mode etc. I will awnser when I talk about a TP then it will be much clearer.

U read not everything I see...

1.35 23 5 1.35 33 5 Pips are mostly shown as you say, in this example 10 pips a 4-digit Broker. 235-335 are still 100 points/pips in a 5-digit Broker it's just the way you look at it.

It is a game of probability. 50/50 chance .Enter with the mindset of playing with the 100$.You may come out smiling ( unscathed) or sad ( wounded).

--- 帖子 #13 ---
The last digit is a point. A pip is a pip 4 or 5 digit broker

--- 帖子 #14 ---
@ aje6767 If you read and understand it well you see that it is not a 50/50 chance.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Oh sorry I thought it is.I need to carefully go throug it again.

@ ExForX Read again

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I agree with BirminghamUK, A pip is a pip, 4 or 5 digit broker. you can mess with lot sizes but not pips.

Sell Day 22: Open 1.35355 Close 1.35296 Gain: 59 Pips 59 Pips x (0.00001/ 1.35296 )x(514$ x 200) = 44$ +514$ = 558$ Sell Day 22: Open 1.35355 Close 1.35296 Gain: 5.9 Pips 5.9 Pips x (0.0001/ 1.3523 )x(514$ x 200) = 44$ +514$ = 558$ Let's continue on focussing on the strategy and not on the meaning of a pip. Green pipping to everyone

Yes or no would have been shorter... anyway, I think I misunderstood indeed. So you ended up with 27K and you withdrew it? Also great! Question still remains, this broker paid you that amount? People are always looking for good reliable brokers so it's valuable info.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I'm interested in the gambling theory. But 3.4 pips for 4 digit broker? I'm not yet convinced.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Jysticim Thank you for the chart. Correct me if I'm wrong: Rules 1. Take a position at 10am London time = the beginning of 3rd bar from London open. Short if the previous bar/2nd bar/9-10am is negative/downward, Long otherwise. 2. Close the position 23 hours later at 9am next day unless SL hits. If I'm right, this system has a tremendous possibility. I really like the idea that you enter once a day at London opening. I'm trying this kind of trading method for a long time with fair success. The key is SL, TP, and BE, I think. Also, I'm a little more flexible about the entering time. I use stochastics to find when to enter. Good luck!

Day 2 805 Pips?!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
It's 80.5 pips or 805 pipettes...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
@ ExForX Yes the broker Exness paid that amount, I am in partnered with them and I can say that they are reliable. But there are many more good brokers out there. I have met brokers that didn't refuse pay outs but for example have a lot of lag on big events etc. But I can say that the brokers listed here on FF are fair enough to give a try. But I think Google can give you the best awnser to your question. @ wilsonch Yes you are right. If you play arround with high leverage like 1:2000 the set in stone SL is really short only 3,4 pips. But if you go a 10 factors lower to 1:200 you have a set in stone SL of 34 pips and that good enough. @ Forexgogo Yes you are almost right. London opening: 9:00 (London time, GMT) 1st Candle 9:00-10:00 (We don't trade here, it's the breakout) 2st Candle 10:00-11:00 (At the beginning of the candle we close the trade of yesterday) At the end of the candle we open the new trade. Buy if the candle is bullish Sell if the candle is bearish 3th Candle 11:00-12:00 (Here we do nothing) @ savingpig Yup, totally right. I write 805 for my calculations. Green pipping to everyone

Doesn't London open 8:00? And isn't londen @ gmt+1?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
@ Anusragger London stocks open at 8 AM but forex "opens, the candle"at 9 AM. Plus we don't need to trade the opening breakout! London is GMT. GMT = Greenwich Mean Time Greenwich maps: https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Gre...70a7a162e4ca6c

Hi Jysticim, Just to clarify I see your hard stop at 3.4 pips but almost everyday the price retraced at some point to take you out. ie day 1 it pulled back 10 day 2 pulled back 9 pips midday before going 80 pips. day three 4 pips. What am I missing? Don

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hmmm, but forexfactory sessions shows london open @ 8:00 and because of daylight saving london is @ gmt+1. Or am I wrong?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
To my knowledge is the london open @ 07:00 GMT ie 09:00 GMT +2 dutch time.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
No, it is not " only a word comprehension". It doesn't matter whether it is a 4-digit Broker or 5-digit Broker, the truth is that the amount of 100 pips is NOT the same as 10 pips. Even a beginner knows that fact! Therefore, using the above example: With a 4 digit broker Buy at 1.3523 ... exit the trade at 1.3533 = +10 pips With a 5 digit broker Buy at 1.35235 ... exit the trade at 1.35335 = +10 pips As you can see, whether it is a 4 digit broker or 5 digit broker, the result of the above trade is exactly the same. Both trades made +10 pips each. The 5 digit broker did not make "100 pips". However, if you want then you can say the 5 digit broker made "10.0" pips. That would be accurate. But "100" pips is not accurate. I just want to be sure others here are not mis-led when you say that you made "100 pips" but in reality you made only 10 pips. I am just making sure people know the truth of the exact number of pips you win or lose.

So, if you didn't pull that $27k out and kept going you would have now been $19million richer? lol If this method was so easy to turn $100 to $27k in 5 days, why not keep doing it and let us know how many times it's worked? Just cash out every fifth day (I understand going any further with such leverage will have massive psychological effects) Sorry for my skepticism but if this is purely a mechanical method, this can easily be coded and everyone turning $100 into $20k in 5days we'd all be rich... what did you say your projected winning probability for this method was? PS. as Ace_1 mentioned above - 10pips is 10pips.. you can't say a broker with 5 digits that it's 100pips.. it's your calculation in working out the profit/loss that's changing, but at the end of the day the correct amount of pips is 10... (or as someone else mentioned, you could say 100 pipettes... I guess lol)

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Just had a look at that broker with the huge leverage - on their website it shows max leverage of 1:2000 for accounts less than $3,000, and is automatically adjusted according to the account equity... Account Equity | Leverage $0 — 3000 (1:2000) $3 000 — 9 999 (1:1000) $10 000 — 19 999 (1:600) $20 000 — 49 999 (1:400) $50 000 — 199 999 (1:200) $200,000 or more (1:100) So, technically the results on the front page must be adjusted (less) to account for leverage because you can't keep using the 1:2000 leverage on all those trades. Sorry was a little off-topic, just though I'd state it for anyone thinking about trying this out on this broker, not to expect those results (in dollar terms)

i have a question as forex gogo say : Rules 1. Take a position at 10 am London time = the beginning of 3rd bar from London open. Short if the previous bar/2nd bar/9-10am is negative/downward, Long otherwise. 2. Close the position 23 hours later at 9am next day unless SL hits. and you confirm that the question is : what exactly the stop loss you use is it as you said yesterday high or low ??? so why in the first post of this thread when you post the result at day 5 ,8 , 9, 10 , 11, 12 , 15 , 16, 19 all the loses are the same 3.5 pip ???? why 3.5 do you use a digital sl equal to 3.5 and not using the high or low ??? and in the post no 3 the result you posted each loosing trade have different sl ??? i am confused ​

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Greenwich time is not being adjusted for summer period. So, London is GMT+1 right now.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
The opening of forex markets is only a rough estimate because it's open 24/7. Sometimes you see more activity already at 7am London time, sometimes at 9am London time... For stocks it is true, the FTSE 100 opens at 8am London time. This is 9am for you from the Netherlands. It's also true that currently London is GMT+1 which means that the stock market in London opens at 9am in GMT-terms. Great site if you are confused with time zones: http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/

@ Don M Read the paragraph under rules again. @ Ace_1 100 Points then, I won't awnser about this anymore. @ pierre23 The strategy is for 1:200 I showed you guys what can happen with 1:2000 leverage. As you can see with 3.4 pips SL that was just luck. But a good example what leverage can do. Plus in the calculations it does not matter, 10 pips/100 points are the same Sell Day 22: Open 1.35355 Close 1.35296 Gain: 59 Pips 59 Pips x (0.00001/1.35296)x(514$ x 200) = 44$ +514$ = 558$ Sell Day 22: Open 1.35355 Close 1.35296 Gain: 5.9 Pips 5.9 Pips x (0.0001/1.3523)x(514$ x 200) = 44$ +514$ = 558$ That is true for normal accounts but I am parntered then the rules are a bit different but I won't go into that let's focus on the strategy itself. @ zelenko Forget about the 1:2000 leverage it is just an example what it can do. Let's focus on the strategy with the leverage of1:200 @ Indrek Exactly, forgot that @ savingpig Ya thats totally true, but normal/winter London it's GMT but now for summer it's GMT+1 Last I want to tell you guys something about London opening, as savingpig already said forex market does not really have an open because it is 24/7. You don't need to take the 2e candle from opening you can take every other candle in the major sessions of the pair. How more trades you make how more you get to the 50/50 win/lose ratio. The entry is as random as a coin flip.

--- 帖子 #38 ---

Hello everyone, Sell Day 22: Open 1.35355 Close 1.35296 Gain: 59 Points // 5.9 Pips 59 Pips x (0.00001/ 1.35296 )x(514$ x 200) = 44$ +514$ = 558$ Buy Day 23( yesterday green ): Open 1.35316 Close 1.35215 Gain: -101 Points // -10.1 Pips -101 Pips x (0.00001/ 1.35215 )x( 558 $ x 200) = -83$ + 558 $ = 475$ Sell Day 23 was taken out by our SL. The SL was yesterdays low. Sell Day 24( today blue ): Open 1.35220 Close xxxxx SL yesterdays high: 1.35357 @ umpats and hartnet Good entry. From now on take every trade from that bar you chose. So next trade will be 24 hour's later but then its weekend, so that is monday. The best is to close it at the end of the day if it is in profit. For you both SL 1.35158

--- 帖子 #42 ---
This is not like gambling. At roulette you have 47.29% to win. So average for every 100 euro (1 euro gamble on the collors ) you get back 47 euros. In roulette there is no edge mathematical, hence it is made for casino scums. In this strategy how more you trade how closer you get to the 50% ratio. If you would use no market analysis and a set in stone SL you would just break even. But we use market analysis in this strategy to determine our SL. This way we can get our DD lower then 50% from our losing trades. We get the edge from our losers think about that. Green pipping to everyone

Errr, Jysticim on my charts the London open was bullish candle followed by another bullish candle therefore a buy signal by your system ? https://charts.mql5.com/5/245/eurusd...el-markets.png

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I understand your very good point Jysticim. And I will join you and explore the concept from monday using different rules as there is no point just copying yours. Still using one entry per day on EURUSD. In the direction shown by a cycle identifier (based on SSALib). SL based on fractals or ATR...... I ll decide this WE. Thanks you for sharing the idea, i ll keep posted.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
@ merquise For example you can take that yes. You need to choose a time/candle for yourself. And take that candle everyday. The best candles to take are candle 2-3-4-5 after London opening because those have the best 50/50 ratio. I always took 3th candle and that is 5 AM NY time. It is not about the entry. The entry is as random as a coin flip. Although you need to consistantly take the same time/candle every day.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Jysticum, On day 3 (june 19) the short open is far above the high of the previous day. Where is your stoploss?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi, Interesting your strategy, But I have a bit "problems" to understanding it. Let see, Example: Day 16/07: London first candle: open @1.35604 , close @1.35592 (bearish) , at the opening of second candle, we close previous order (day 15), at the close of second candle we open a sell order because the second canle was bearish, no? SL on previous day high or low , or open or close? (day 15/07) And we leave the order open till (in this case monday) monday`s second candle open? Is that correct Thanks

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Sorry, we leave day 16/07 order open till second candle of day 17 open`s

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I agree 100% on the first half. And I say your system would be much better than most systems in this forum. Your concept, catching daily fluctuation, is far better idea than catching swing lows/highs by technical analysis or PA or whatever you call it. So, the question is about the rules for entry. Your rules need more improvement -- SL in particular. To me, previous day's high/low is not optimal -- in many cases the price bounces at that level.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Aha, I understand what you are saying, and for a SL you are targeting previous day high/low. One more question, how much % of the account you are risking per trade?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
@ bertpost See the screenshot and you will understand it. But it can occur that you are right and that there is no yesterdays high/low in range then you will use your 34 pips set in stone SL. @ ronichimo Yes you are right we just leave it there till it gets hit by the SL or if it is still running we close it at the opening level of the candle you choose. When the candle closes you open your new trade. Sell if Bearish - Buy if Bullish @ Forexgogo I think that the market is based on physiological interactions, the actions on the market are made by people. Thats why I see support and resistance as a really strong factor although PA is also much worth only you need to be really good at it to be profitable. How can you analyse people of flesh and blood with stubborn mathematical indicators? There can't be rules for entry I will explain this in the next post. About the SL is a good point. Example When the market is not volatile and you get a sign from the candle that your next trade will be a buyer. You glance to yesterdays low and see that it is in range (because we have a low volatile market) your SL now is 15 pips(example) lower then your entry. Because 15 pips is not very much you can longer it to 25 pips as 34 pips is the maximum. You can only do this when the market is not volatile and you are for example in range mode. I will have to research about it how much this occurs. @ merquise You are risking 50% of you account a trade and you trade 100% of the account in one trade. This is pretty much. I still trade my main trading strategy on my main account and I made a second account for this strategy. I made this thread and strategy to not get bored.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi, someone did a backtest on this strategy?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hello everyone, In this post I will explain why we make those paticular -not paticular at all- entries. Nature of Random We all know those fun casino games were we get to wager our well earned money in the hope we win something. Sloth machines, blackjack, roulette we all know them and they have one thing in common. They all make you lose money. This is because you can't have the edge mathematical the winning factor is always below the 50%. Randomness means lack of pattern or predictability in events. Randomness suggest a non-ordor or non-coherence in a sequence of symbols or steps, such that there is no inteligible pattern or combination. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness For example roulette is random but to what degree is it random, the same for forex it seems to be random. Everyone knows what roulette is, you throw a ball into a bin and in this bin you have a spinning wheel with numbers. The outcome seems to be random mathematical there is no way to predict the outcome of the next number. You can use all kinds of mathematical betting systems and it won't work because you have the 47% winning chance that makes you always lose money at last. But roulette is not random, if we look it the physical way it is totally not random. If you could pauze the world and calculate the ball speed know the circumference of the bin and the speed of the wheel with numbers you can totally predict the outcome of the numbers and win big. Here is a interesting video about this: Beating the Wheel Inserted Video "No one can win at Roulette unless he steals money from the table while the croupier isn’t looking" Einstein I beat you there mate. So to what degree is forex random. Forex is totally not random at all. But you can make your entries random. When something is random you get always a specific ratio. For example we have numbers 1-10 let a random number generater generate 100,000 numbers and you will see that all the numbers came up arround 10%. At forex when you take a random entry it can go 2 ways, up or down. So after the long run you will get that 50% ratio. So if everybody just entered random they would break even eventually. But why does 90% of all traders lose money? That's because they use mathematical analysis, like indicators that use history to predict the outcome of something that is made out of flesh and blood in the present. It's the same as trying to predict/win roulette with maths and that doesn't work. So with our random entries with a 50% winning/losing ratio we would break even. This is where our SL comes in. We look at yesterdays high/lows support and resistance "physical" analysis. We will always win 50% of the trades so we cut our losses to not have a DD of 50% and we are winning. Again we are making money from our hitted support and resistance SL, think about it. Green pipping to everyone

1. Roulette : assuming an unbiased wheel, the house edge is always fixed at 5.26% (if two zeros on the wheel) or 2.70% (one zero). Hence roulette is not 50/50, and the punter will always lose money in the long term, no matter what strategy or MM he uses. 2. Blackjack : the edge is constantly changing , depending on the ratio of high cards to low cards remaining in the deck. A skilled card counter can win at blackjack, by placing higher bets when the odds are favorable, and lower bets otherwise. That's why casinos ban card counters. Hence roulette is a random game, blackjack not completely so. 3. Forex trading : costs like spreads and commissions effectively create a 'house edge', that works against the trader, hence forex is not 50/50. Costs reduce the size of winning trades, and increase the size of losing trades. If price movement is always completely random, then forex is analogous to roulette, and all traders will eventually lose, no matter what strategy or MM they use. If price movement is not always random, then forex is analogous to blackjack, in that traders can trade when the odds are in the favor, and sit out of the market otherwise. If the trader's edge is sufficient to exceed the costs, then he has positive expectancy, and will win in the long term. A trader who is making random entries and exits has no edge, and costs will eventually defeat him. Analogously, he is playing blackjack, which is potentially beatable, but he doesn't have the card counting skills (i.e. trading expertise) that is needed to win.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Jysticim, why do you continue to say throughout this thread:"10 pips and 100 pips are the same"? 10 pips and 100 pips are NOT the same. Have you not been taught mathematics in school? Even a 5 year old child knows the number 10 is different than the number 100. I am not trying be a jerk, but I am just frustrated that you don't know the difference between 10 pips and 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Does card counting still work, thought it was a thing of the past? These days dealers use shuffling machines and multiple decks

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You're correct, modern countermeasures employed by casinos make it much more difficult. According to games expert Mike Shackleford, "...... with today's rules, a realistic advantage the counter will have is only 0.5% to 1.5%. You will not only win money slowly and gradually but your bankroll will go up and down like a roller coaster in the short run. Only in the long run, over hundreds of hours of playing, can you count on winning. " ( source )

--- 帖子 #59 ---
People are so hung up about this pip thing. I use a six digit broker which trades 1/10 of a pip, &amp; on the trading platform it calls one tenth of a pip 1 pip. I guess it's slightly confusing if one person calls 100th of a cent a pip and someone else calls a thousandth of a cent a pip. But once it has been explained what is meant, is it worth going on about it forever &amp; a day.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
@ hanover Exactly no mathematical strategy can beat roulette. Because you don't predict where the ball is going to land. With physics you can, almost nobody knows this. Good friend of my made a roulette computer that does the calculations. Inserted Video Forex is not 50/50 it is not random at all. But you can make your entries random and close them consistantly with rules, forex doesn't need to be random for that. @ fugly Card counting works as hanover says but it is hard and you will need a really long run to be minimal profitable. If those pitbosses see you winning all the time and not losing no matter if you win almost nothing they kick you out.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
If you talk about an analogy of forex and gambling, I just want to say this: Say, when you see 100 consecutive "black" in roulette, do you bet "red" or "black" on next one? If you bet on "black" you are more likely to succeed in forex. This is what I believe. Of course, the winning rate of "black" and "red" is the same. But I'm talking about the mentality here -- the mentality that considers "100 consecutive black" as "a strong black trend." For that mentality, betting on "red" is like catching a falling knife bare hand. Yet, a majority of people bet on "red." How many forex traders do you think have this kind of mentality? A very few, I say. That is why only a few traders are successful in forex. Get it??

Is SL 34 or yesterdays H/L ? You said both in that sentence. Are you risking 50% each trade.....and then base the lot size on what? SL or 34 or yesterdays H/L?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
@ Forexgogo I understand what you say but I don't agree with you fully. What if there are 100 "black" and the trend reverse. We need to keep our entry as random as possible to get the 50% ratio. We will make the profit with our SL, later tonight I will post something about a TP when the market is not volatile. There was a research if monkeys could trade vs humans and suprisingly they did better hint: randomness . http://www.automaticfinances.com/monkey-stock-picking/ @ cspip If you trade with a leverage of 1:200 and you want to have max DD of 50% you can only afford to lose 34 pips no matter what lot size ofcourse. That's why we have a set in stone SL of 34 pips. If we just did every trade with a SL of 34 pips we would just break even. The money comes from yesterdays high/lows. When the high/lows are in range of 34 pips we use the high/lows. When they are not in range for example we buy a day and yesterday the low is 40 pips lower we just use the set in stone SL of 34 pips.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Volatility Volatility of the market is kind of a big factor in my strategy. To gain 50% a day we need to have a difference of 34 pips between open and close in our favor because we don't use a TP. Someone can ask why do we need that 50% gain a day, that's immense. We need to have that 50% gain the hold of the risk reward ratio 1:1. We have situations when the market is very volatile alot of red news etc. Then we are likely to have more then 34 pips moves a day. If we just put a TP at 34 pips we wouldn't make up for the days that the market is less volatile. So what we learn from this is to have not a TP at a volatile market. We have also situations where the market is almost sleeping/ranged mode. We have no 34 pips difference between open and close. But in that time period the market can still move 34 pips and retrace for example. We can look here on FF at the calendar and see almost no important news for the pair (EUR/USD) When we see that we can use a special TP. I will explain this with a chart. Example At 20 June we sold. Market is medium volatile. Lets say we started that day on our account with 100 euro. The red lines are where you see what happened normally without a TP. We use 1 trade with 100% of the account ballance. SL yesterdays high but that's not in range of 34 pips so we use a set in stone 34 pips SL at 1.36362 Sel Day 6-20 ( red lines) Open 1.36022 Close 1.35803 Gain: 219 Pips/points 219 Pips x (0.00001/ 1.35803 )x(100$ x 200) = 32$ +100$ = 132$ When we use my TP rule we can make more out of this day. When you want to use the TP rule the market needs to be medium/less volatile. When you know this you open not 1 trade with 100% of the account ballance but you open 2 trades with both 50%. Trade #1 you set a TP of 34 pips. SL yesterdays high but that's not in range of 34 pips so we use a set in stone 34 pips SL at 1.36362 Trade #2 you set no TP. SL yesterdays high but that's not in range of 34 pips so we use a set in stone 34 pips SL at 1.36362 Trade #1 ( green lines, TP) Sel Day 6-20 Open 1.36022 Close 1.35682 Gain: 340 Pips/points 340 Pips x (0.00001/ 1.35682 )x(50$ x 200) = 25$ +100$ = 125$ Trade #2 ( blue lines) Sel Day 6-20 Open 1.36022 Close 1.35803 Gain: 219 Pips/points 219 Pips x (0.00001/ 1.35803 )x(50$ x 200) = 16$ +100$ = 116$ 16$ + 25$ + 100$ = 141$ As you can see only with a good/smart TP you can increase the profit of this particular day by 28% ( Pink SL, 1.36362, for all trades) Rules for TP - Open two trades 50% each of the account. - One trade with a TP at 34 pips. - One trade with no TP. PS: The collored lines of open and close need to be on top of each other ofcourse. Green pipping to everyone

In trade #1 - you are not telling the truth when you say you gained "340 pips". You did NOT gain 340 pips. Instead, you actually gained 34.0 pips . In trade #2 - you are not telling the truth when you say you gained "219 pips". You did NOT gain 219 pips. Instead, you actually gained 21.9 pips . I don't understand why it is so hard for you to write the correct amount of pips you have gained. You are misleading people - especially those people that quickly scan your posts and only see the pip total you write.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
@ Ace_1 I am saying 340 Pips/points as I have shown before it does not matter in the calculations, you know that. My posts are not made for the people that scan them quickly as they will never understand it. You will need to read everything from start carefully. If you don't want to spend time reading you will never succeed in forex. If you read everything well you understand why I write 340 Pips/points. For the people that only search for the results in pips they will never succeed in forex because they don't understand it. It is not about the gain in amounts of pips. It does not matter if you make 10 Pips or 250 Pips I hope you understand this. You only need to gain something positive, if you would make like 5 pips a day you will be in financial freedom in no time. I hope you understand this.

Hi Ace, hope this is the last time we hear from you on this pips or points argument. Its pretty obvious open and close price are stated in the post, if ONE cannot do a simple calculation on 340 pips or 34 pips, then there is no point leading them. My concern here would be to see if stone SL (at max DD 50%) can survive in long run. Ace, you are most welcome to contribute more ideas such as improving entry, trade management etc on the trading system.

Jesus the most negative people inhabit this website Propose an idea and people try and tear you apart

@ wilsonch I am backtesting it myself manually from the beginning of this year 1-1-2014. With start ammount 100 euro, 1:200 leverage. We will see if the SL can survive the long run. I tested Win/Lose ratio of the last 5 months the results are in the second post. I hope that I can post the results tonight. Something OT, you will always have people like Ace also IRL. I don't mind that. They still bring something positive because I can make a good post about his reactions. Other people and Ace can learn from this. #Post 66.

@ Jysticim Does it mean you are one hour in the trade?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
@ MCRotter They only had random entries and trailing stops. As I said before our money does not come from that it comes from the market analysis. If you would use the set in stone SL you would break even. We use support and resistance to determine our SL. Because we are sure that we make ~50% of the time a winning trade we need to cut our losses by using market analysing. @ Kofix11 Read first page again and you will understand that we make 1 trade a day.

You're gains can't be correct, there is no way you have a 800+ pip winner since June 17

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Its been over and over this.........he means 800+ pipettes or 80+ pips

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I think guys you should stop focusing on the pips.... and look into the concept instead.... It was said many times.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Jysticim just a question here please, assuming you start out with $100 at 1:200 leverage and your broker does not permit anything below 1000 units of currency (0,01 lots) wouldnt 4 consecutive losses of 34 pips each (50% DD each time) mean you can't trade anymore. This of course would apply only if you started out with $100 and had 4 consecutive losses right away. In post #2 could you tell us the max consecutive losses in your back test

--- 帖子 #78 ---
@ fugly Yes you are right about that. If you just have a basic account and broker doesn't allow a trade below 1000 units unfortunately you have to switch brokers. Some reputable brokers that allow trades below 1000 units: - XM - MahiFX - Oanda - IBFX I did a 5 months back test (now I am testing the whole year) with the result of 2 times in a row a hit of the 34 set in stone SL, that's a total DD of 75% stated in post #9 Plus I wouldn't start with more then 100$ as you know the big DD.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
So, when you say an SL of 34, what you mean is 3.4 pips, right? My brokers EU spread is 2.5pips.... it wont even let me put an SL so close to that, as 1 tick in the wrong direction would stop me out. And even with a broker with 1pip spread are you saying 50% of the time it wont move 2.4pips in the wrong direction (accounting for the spread)?...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Pierre, the 3.4 pip s/l was if you were using the 2000:1 leverage. At 200:1 your stop would be 34 actual pips to hit the 50% dd

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Ok got it thanks

--- 帖子 #82 ---
last friday Long trade but SL triggered and loss Lets see today @ Jysticim last friday was buy day or sell day?? The candle color is green for me.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
@ umpats Last friday I sold, attached screenshot. It does not matter what candle you take it is all about that you take that candle everytime. My SL got also triggererd. Sell Day 24( opened before the weekend ): Open 1.35220 Close 1.35357 Gain: -137 // 13.7 Pips -137 Pips x (0.00001/1.35357)x(475$ x 200) = -96$ +475$ = 379$ Soon I will post the results of this year January.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
what are you using to back test? are you paper testing? i had a similar idea to this, but i didnt test it out as i thought it was silly. you might have some merit. the only problem i can really see with this system is that you could be stuck in perpetually making some money then losing then making then losing, etc, etc. with a 50% DD risk PER TRADE you could theoretically never blow your account.... although i dont think many brokers will allow you to trade with just a dollar and then let you continue if you keep halving your account into the pennies , this is interesting though, keep at it. i may decide to do some backtesting of my own.....

--- 帖子 #85 ---
thanks Jysticim i am confused, we need to enter after 2 candle. for example, now here london open at 3 pm so i need to enter at 6 pm (after ending 5 pm candle)??

--- 帖子 #86 ---
@ umpats It doesn't matter what candle you trade, trade that candle everytime. Only don't trade the break out you choose the 2e candle friday. Stick to that candle.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
@ TerryTibbs I am paper testing because I don't trust EA backtesting. We won't get stuck because we use market analysing the account ballance always moves. You are right about that theoretically you can never blow your account. The results January 2014: From 1-1-2014 till 2-1-2014 Leverage 1:200 Start with 100$ SL 34 pips or yhigh/ylow No TP Total gain: 285 Pips/points Ending 48$ Growth: -52% Biggest DD: 98% Biggest Growth: 533% 10 losses in a row 3 wins in a row Conlcusion: We can survive really big DD's. We need to use the TP rule. Maybe we need other leverage. Results with TP rule will be posted soon.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
have you tried the MT4i trading simulator for MT4? it uses the strategy tester like you would back test an EA but this is different. it lest you manually enter trades, you can use any indicator you like, edit charts just like normal and put orders in like normal. it records all your trades like they were same as demo or live account and you can get a report afterwards including a graph. they have changed their name to FXblue or something and in my opinion their older version of their app was better, i dont really like their new one. check it out if you want, you will get more accurate results and better stat recording. also, if you want the old MT4i trading simulator let me know, i'll try dig out the .zip file if i can find it.

What is the lot size that you used on the first trade with when you had 100 $ on account, and how do you determine the max lot for each trade you have your own calculator, or just you divide the amount you have in your account with the Sl, to determine the size of the lot accordingly. Regards, I would like to test this strategy live

@ TerryTibbs Thank you very much @ TheDivine You need a lot calculator, excel sheet, I would first demo it if I was you.

Sell Day 25: Open 1.35241 Close xxxxxxx We use TP, so 189.5$ each trade. We open 2 trades 50% each. Trade #1 SL 1.35459 TP 1.34901 Trade #2 SL 1.35459 no TP

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hello, How do you determine TP and SL? If I correctly understand, TP is the friday's low, but SL is unclear. Also, why don't use the ADR for placing TPs?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
TP for trade 1 should be 1.35119? 34 pips? (or 340 pipettes)

--- 帖子 #96 ---
yes 34 pips for 4 digits or 340 pipettes for 5 digits

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I guess 34 pips is for stop loss not profit. Bomi

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Yes, my mistake..........it is 34 pips

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Sorry for all the fuss I explain everything in a screenshot Sell Day 25: Open 1.35241 Close xxxxxxx We use TP, so 189.5$ each trade. We open 2 trades 50% each. Trade #1 SL 1.35459 TP 1.34901 Trade #2 SL 1.35459 no TP SL is yesterdays high 1.35459, 21.8 Pips TP Trade #1 is 34 pips TP Trade #2 nothing I also checked if the TP could increase the profits of January but that's not possible. In January we have alot of turn points arround 30 Pips in.

one comment: the broker is never going to hunt "YOUR" Stop Loss... they only "hunt" where there are several orders... for example, round numbers... if your stop is there, yeah they could get you... just avoid this points... A nice book about this subject is "beat the forex dealer..."

@ room217 Thank you for you comment I appreciatie it. I would like to inform everybody that I will be not posting/trading next few days/week because I am on holiday. At the moment still backtesting March this year, results are good. Green pipping to everyone

--- 帖子 #105 ---
For those that have been testing this out, have you been including the spread into the 3.4 pip stoploss or have you just added it on top? Cheers -RPM

--- 帖子 #106 ---
i think this has been discussed already. its not 3.4pips but 34pips if using 1:200 leverage. the 3.4pips was if you are using 1:2000 leverage. i think thats not very sensible as spread/normal volatility will hit this almost 100% of the time.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Haha, I get the pips thing Terry, I'm referring to the spread being included in the stoploss, sorry you must have missed that.. I just need to know if everyone has been including spread into the stoploss. For example if the spread was 0.8, are you guys using a 2.6 pip stoploss to make it upto 3.4? RPM

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I think Terry's point was that no one is actually using the 3.4 pip s/l as they're using a lower leverage, i.e. 200:1. So adding or not adding the spread to 34 pips isn't a critical difference. But to answer from that perspective, I'm including the spread in the 34.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I hate to be that guy, but the whole method is pointless in my view, you can't put large orders into the market and expect not have the market move to take your order out. This method is a sure fire way to ruin, anyone thinking otherwise is seriously fooling themselves. It is super speculative, and if I ever got to 280,000, as the OP suggests is possible (which I doubt) I would take it out immediately.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Just find this thread, looks fun Btw all this talk about pips and 5 diggits vs diggits,, 1pips is the same as 10 points 5 diggit brooker show down to points 4 diggit show only down to pips Happy trading all!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
i am checking your trading and i'm not sure with your report. don't get the wrong idea, this is a very terrific trading report!! and i'm willing to do the same (it gave me the urge and motivation that it's possible to reach). but before i do at real one, i have some questions first. is this real or still demo? (i know it sound stupid, bear with me okay?) ^_^ i've checking your image posting and i see it's on a 5 digit broker. the next questions is, is it your SL is 340 or 34? because if it's 34. i've seen your SL been touch before it reach the end day trade. (you can see the pictures below for further questioning explanation). Attached Image (click to enlarge) if it's 340, then at your 8 day trading, how come it reach 340? because it's barely touch 340 and it still can move to the next day (i've checked it by my own MT4 it have gaps another 140++ points). the other part is, on your 7th day, you are supposed to be minus (according to your system) but then again it's write it down profitable. can you explain this more? last one is, at this post below i think you write it down wrongly.. so it makes the whole calculation is wrong.. but then again, if this is real or demo you can just show us your history report right? Attached Image (click to enlarge) sorry for my bad english, not really good using english ^_^ P.s: eager to learn from you ^_^ and what broker you use? i might wanna use it if you can give me the link ^_^

--- 帖子 #112 ---
@sinexcellent In regards to your question about his SL being hit before the end of trade day. From the first post it looks like he is using an EA that only executes the SL if the candle closes beyond this SL. So it disregards any ranging that happens while the candle is open. "Something more about the SL. I have a EA that closes the trade and not a set in stone SL incase the broker stop hunts (what I think they don't do but you never know). The EA closes the trade when a candle closes above/below yesterdays high/low. So it doesn't close the trade when it spikes in the range and retraces. " If this is the case, my question is what EA is he using? Perhaps Jysticim can let us know when he returns from Holiday...

--- 帖子 #113 ---
and still the above pictures explain it all that its beyond the pass point where the SL will be touched. well, it's still bothers me about the cases here.. so i'm waiting for more certain answers. hope Jysticim will coming home sooner.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
i havnt really tested this whole thing out but ive been thinking about it a lot and this is actually quite difficult to do. And the reason is because we are essentially going "double or half". that means we're looking to go for 2:1 RR.... this is not something that is easy to do consistently. its quite possible he just got lucky in his first few trades where he made 27k from 100!! dont get me wrong, getting a strategy that nets you 2:1 isnt that hard, getting a strategy to net you +66% win ratio also isnt that hard. getting them both together in one strategy IS hard. Sure, trying to randomise your entries "should" get you 50% win ratio but thats not enough. Jysticim is using only the previous days high/low plus hard SL (if outside range) to get his 'edge'. this may raise his win % but will it raise it till +66%??? i dont think so. Also we have to be going for 2:1 in all trades we take. there's no accounting for this in the strategy. This can only work if you have a strategy that will net you +66% win ratio with typical 2:1 RR on all trades..... and if you have strategy like this already then you've already got your holy grail!! so you wont be looking on Forec Factory threads for something special..... i'll see what Jysticim has to say when he returns.... my hopes have lowered somewhat on this whole thing.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Correct! Again, spot on. Maybe there are some traders out there that can do it but they are far to busy enjoying private islands, jets, yachts and so on so they will not have any time left posting on FF.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Actually, that's not the case. "If" you have a 2:1 with 10 net wins you can make a successful go on this. Check out the "Rags to Riches" thread that Jysticim linked to in post #1

--- 帖子 #117 ---
been trying for a past few days and the result is so not promising yet. using the same rules, using $100 and the balance now is $68. my rules is in general is like this. buy and sell is by the same rules books. the SL is 302 points (pipettes) or 30.2 pips if i'm using SL 32 pips the price movement almost touch the SL. so, going to try using SL 32 pips. with the TP 64 pips. but.... from my point of view in this EUR USD, it's not even possible for eurusd to make that much (we can count it manually the daily average). so i'm going to switch to another pair that are working with this rules. i still believe this is achievable because years ago i did the same using my 300 USD and it gain 1k USD in a few days. (i don't know is that beginner lucks or what..)

--- 帖子 #118 ---
hello fallowers look at the post #1 in day 8, 9 and 10 ,11 and 12, 5 losing trades in the row.how he still surviving with $19 million??? regards fred

--- 帖子 #119 ---
@terry i saw what you post before but i dont know why you delete it. well, like i said it's achieveable from my own experience, and from my point of view. we just don't know how yet. i've been trading years using a big amount of money to do safe trade. but sometimes i wonder, how to achieve the high profit with low risk. i believe, changing pair (outside the EUR/USD right now) will surely show the result. the key to success using this method is, finding a pair which have low spread and high daily average movement. And lastly how to do the MM (i think in every forex trading it always about the MM and the strategy with the daily movement). happy pipping

--- 帖子 #120 ---
woops sorry the picture had a naughty word in it! i somehow ended up deleting the whole post! bear with me.... also, i have just realised my broker timings are all wrong.... even though its Alpari UK its not at GMT or GMT+1 even, the MT4i also has a delayed entry, one or two candles after...im trying to figure out what candles i was actually getting in at and what candles i was getting out at. they are different to Jysticim timings. have also just realised i was not getting out of a trade and in a trade at the same candle.... its a bit of a mess, but there is a method in all this madness, im trying to piece together the correct timings. this thing seems feasable guys.... just need to tweak a few things....get it just right and this could bloody well work. also have just noticed it was just a little over 2months of backtesting not 3! which makes the results even more crazy.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi there, The sell date 8 and sell date 9 seems to be wrong or may be not calculated properly both look the same, in essence sell date 9 should become 00 at the end of the day, Sell Day 8: Open 1.36138 Close 1.36172 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36172)x(280,421$ x 2000) = -140,210$ +280,421$ = 140,210$ Sell Day 9: Open 1.36115 Close 1.36149 Gain: -34 Pips -34Pips x (0.00001/1.36149 )x(280,421$ x 2000) = -140,210$ +280,421$ = 140,210$

--- 帖子 #122 ---
well, actually from jyticsm we can learn about many think and broaden our mind. his key is being stick to the rules as simple as should be regardless any indicator or templates. and the stick to the rules part is : just use that 1 candlestick as your point of view and make it as your starting entry and exit point. example, my broker is pepperstone with GMT +3 my eurusd candletime i set is at 12:00 in H1 and my xauusd candletime i set is at 13:00 in H1 i use 100 USD real, and try to break the rules first to see how things went. what is the limit of the movement, and about using no SL rules.. well i already applied that in my past experience, and i can say i really2 i can't suggest that. because according to our vision and backtest... well it is profitable, but how bout the next time? are you willing to risk 90% of your money to earn the 10% of the profit if things are sour? example : we take buy, where the movement is going down.. how big is the lot is? if you take 100 pips = Margin out/ Margin Call/ Stop out and the movement is 101 pips going sour (going down) before land the right direction (going up). dont you feel and think its kinda risky to do that? i think it's much wiser to put the SL with some certain rules like SL on higher or lower yesterday high and low. but than again, if you want to risk all your money so, your money is your own SL. well why not? it's 50 usd or 100 usd we risk on it. not like a few grand or something.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
yep i agree stop loss is needed! i did two more runs on different dates and margin called on both tries! looks like i just had one lucky run before. if i had employed the strategy jyticsm has laid out here in months jan and feb of this year with real money, i wouldve been millionaire by now! its possible guys.... but you still have to be lucky. this isnt trading, this is more like lottery, but with much better odds. youre risking $100 each "lottery ticket" to potentially make $100k+. its bette odds than the lottery thats for sure and i think in the future i might give this a go now and then, but it is no trading plan

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I see that I have to explain alot, I am home in about 3 days.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Probably so, considering people have used your own data and trades you posted, and have not come up with the same results you posted. Also, almost every broker in the world uses 5 digits and almost no broker in the world use 1:2000 leverage. Considering your thread is 7 pages long and everyone is still confused about whether your stop is 3.4 or 34, maybe you can help clear it up. Also, GMT time is standard, yet you don't clearly define "opening day, candle, etc", by GMT. Just a few thoughts.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Please do..... I am waiting for your explanation on the dependency in the trade which I have mentioned in the post #121??????

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Yes, the time can be confusing.........just use the time on your watch / wall clock. Since you are in UK, should be easier....... The hourly candle that starts when its 10:00am in UK close yesterday's trade if it still open When this candle that started at 10:00am closes, (at 11:00am) get ready to open the days trade. If that candle that opened at 10:00am and is about to close at 11:00am is bullish, go long, if bearish, go short. I think Jysticim is trying with having two positions opened with diff TPs, that has SL of yesterdays Hi/Lo if the Hi or Lo is more than 34 pips..........if less than use 34pip SL and TP of one trade having 34 pips and the other trade you leave and close till 10:00am the next day.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
@ Jysticim Is it possible to show a chart next time or the one from last Friday. So we can see exactly which candle gives the signal according your rules. Thanks anyway for this thread and your work.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
You guys are making this way too tough. The OP already said it doesn't matter what bar you use. Pick a time that's good for you. (For me it's the Tokyo open as I'm using the UsdJpy) and be consistent with that one. Don't over complicate it.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
i am gonna try this. but not gonna try to do some grand amusement dream. like making $100k USD just using $100. i'm gonna set start from $100 make it until $500 and then $1000 and then $10000, and last will be $50k USD why stop at 50K USD? because if i reach this point, i'm gonna trade using a safer way and that way, i can support my family. and maybe, "maybe" i gonna make another round using this for a very long trade until reach some point. yes please do. i'm agree. nice to see our friendly neighborhood here

--- 帖子 #131 ---
sinexcellent, You are wrong to stop at 50,000 Some time your mind is clouded by "safety"... How about this solution: if you even get to 50,000$... You should withdraw 1000$ which give you 10x 100$ tries... Use the 49,000$ to play safely and then "re-start the gamble game for the other 10 x 100$.. so you have 10 tries.. " That way you can get...another 50,000$.. ---- On another note that people should notice: The author is using "sonic R" system but the rule is not from sonic R.. ---- I would say the only people who can succeed gambling is the people who have a job where.. 100$ is not a problem to lose per month.. ------ Since the author already claimed he withdraw 27,000$ profit from a initial 100$ balance. It would be nice if he post a screen shot of his "trades statement" of wining 100$ to 27,000$... which is I would say incredible accomplishment.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I think this random, high leverage &amp; High DD method needs an EA for live trading. That way our nerves don't stop it in the remote scenario it could reach 1 million or more.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
HyperD, Yes I agree 100%. Using EA would follow your trading plan 100%. However, some system is too complex to be code to EA so it require manual gut action to keep following the rule. For this thread purpose, the author "rule is simple enough to code EA." So it's applicable in the author scenario. ---- Just another suggestion to help some people out, it's best that you "own a RE-Loadable DEBIT visa/master card". Because you going to be blowing 100$ SO FAST... that you need the FASTEST way to deposit new 100$. Deposit by check take 2 week to clear .. and deposit by bankwire cost you 20$ and 3 day clear.. While Debit card take 1 day clear. Step #1 Open a New Gambling mini account Step #2 Deposit 100$ using DEBIT card (NOT your bank debit card... but your Re-Loadable Debit card) Step #3 Gamble Away (if you have an EA it would be so much easier too)

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Interesting thread. When you say the 2nd candle for entry, what time frame are you talking about? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
After reading this thread carefully I will say that Jysticim's intend to help other gambler succeed is really strong. I think you should lower the risk to 30% instead of 50% you should get "good result" If you want the BEST volatility candle then pick candle during London session. If you want the LOWEST risk candle then pick candle during Asian session (why? because sometime asian session move down 50 pip... you can only set sl at previous day high.. so what happen if previous day high is 50 pip. You won't be able to bet a trade during london sessions... Although it's not like it will kill you to not trade for a day lol ) I think i'll just going to test this out for a month on demo and see. I am not going to use 50% though just only 30% because 30% is enough for me. Also just to help some other people out: Don't gamble on anything but EURusd &lt;-- you have been warn.... (don't event think about trading on usdjpy because average daily range is below 34 pip so your tp usually never get hit...) EurUsd = cheap spread and decent volatility that is enough to tp 34 pip but still not hit your stoploss most of the time Here are some average daily range stats.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Sorry Victor, I have to disagree a bit. Eurusd has a low ADR since some time - only slightly better than UsdJpy. As we want to catch some bigger move we should always use a pair with higher ADR. The 20 pairs ADR indicator from this thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...74#post7603174 may help to choose the right pair.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
hello chjungen, Too much volatility is not good, it will hit the stop loss more often. Too little volatility you won't hit tp 34 pip. We are not trying to catch big move. The main objective is to get : Risk 1: Reward 1 consistently without your stoploss hit. But anyway: I have did that math for the "USA" people since I live in usa so I am am force to obey NFA broker rule 50:1 leverage. So the math come out to: If you set SL at 34 pip the maximum risk you can take is 15% PER TRADE only.... (boooooo...) But whatever 15% is still ok more chance for survival rate. I have upload an excel for people to play around if they are not living in USA where they can get access to leverage greater than 50:1... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #138 ---
hi I just wondering since his SL could not be higher than 34 pips,then he stated yesterday's high and low is his SL i really dont understand which one is his SL? 34 pips or yesterday's high or low. because yesterday's high and low could be much higher than 34 pips. plus 5 times in the row losing trades and still surviving without margin call????? with $100 bank deposit and leverage1: 2000 and 5 times losing trades in the row and no margin call?????

hello fredgold3434, From what I have read, it seem his stoploss "max number is 34 pip" But if the previous day high/low is SMALLER than 34 pip say ....it's 25 pip difference . Then you set your trade at 25 pip sl instead of 34 pip. Also about the margin call, all of this is base on 50% loss not $... so the balance just get "half every time he loss and his lot size get cut in half for obvious reason." But there will be a point where his balance is too low to even "bet 1 cent per pip" If small balance is too hard to think... you can alway Magnify the problem: Imagine a 1 million$ balance 1st trade : Lose 50% = 500,000$ balance left 2nd trade lose 50% = 250,000$ balance left 3rd trade lose 50% = 125,000$ balance left 4th trade lose 50% = 62,500$ balance left 5th trade lose 50% = 31,250$ balance left as you can see in this example losing 5 trade in a row doesn't mean you are unable to keep making Lower Lot size bet to lose less. Out of curiosity I download his january trade log... some day he lose only -13.2 pip, -8.8 pip, -17.9 pip, -22.6 pip (it's obviously because he have trade that doesn't have TP so if it doesn't tp 34 pip it could retrace back to -17 pip making him forcefully close out the trade because HIS rule is hold the 1 trade until the 24hr period end. Where after he close the trade in a small loss, he will open a new trade at the same time.... This is why low volatility is important but too low votality is just bad.... (sorry usdjpy fan....) Question are good, when he come back from wherever he is, he'll probably answer the question.. Like I have suggest earlier, if people want to gamble and have better success rate.. lower that 50% to 30% risk.. If you live in USA you have no choice so your Max risk is 15% ..which is still good. 66 trades win...you are rich. To be honest 15% risk look so safe on that excel....

hi victor we are saying you are %100 right. you calculate with $1 million for us. just calculate with $100 bank deposit how is possible even your lot size every time gets the smallest possible allowed with that broker,and still surviving? plus the EA which take care of his SL, is waiting to close the candle 34 pips or more then EA close his trade? how that could be possible the candle closed for example 60 pip losing,and then the EA closes his trade only 34 pips? how that could be possible? EA is just a code to do whatever we program it for,they can not do magic. thanks fred

fredgold3434 If he take exactly -34 pip loss in 5 trade then the outcome would look like this excel. Do remember that this is for 200:1 leverage. USA people can't make these kind of bet at 50:1 leverage. Looking at his log his loss is small like I stated...less than 34 pip. As for his EA, he said it on the 1st page, close trade if candle close above/below yesterdays high/low . But he also have the power to close it manually himself if he want to... This is what he said on his "attached log" Leverage 1:200 Start with 100$ SL 34 pips or yhigh/ylow &lt;--- "OR" ... so it's likely the -34 pip on his log is the one he close out by himself.. No TP Attached Image

--- 帖子 #142 ---
if the candle goes 100 pips losing even before closing, it will be margin call for his account by the broker before the EA can do anything. i know that usa people can not have that high leverage,we just take his word and analyzing for his account with 1:2000 leverage. then how his account will look like? regards fred

--- 帖子 #143 ---
On a 1:2000 leverage If he bet 50% risk at 34 pip (mental) stoploss. He will Margin Call at any time the trade goes -61 pip. Ofcourse this is just an "if" scenario... Unlike author you can prevent Margincall by setting "REAL hard stoploss and don't depend on EA..." and "use 30% risk or 15%..."

--- 帖子 #144 ---
In any leverage situation we could easily ruin the account if we don't get a lucky consecutive win streak. We have the same possibilities (3.13%) for 5 consecutive wins than for 5 consecutive loses if chance is 50/50. This system is very risky but at the same time there is a chance it could generate serious profit.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Of course this is 100$ risk to be rich.. That's why we need accuracy the more accuracy signal the better. The author claim that you can "take any candle as reference point. From there there you just bet and "hold for 24 hour exactly" result you should get close to 50/50% random win ratio" AS LONG as you are able to bet AFTER lose 3x loss in a row you should be good because "50/50"... The author is just super greedy with 50% risk. That's why I said to risk only 30% so that way you can have more chance of survival of losing 5 in a row and still doing ok... It's known that having "GOOD MM Risk:Reward" will win in the end... not all Risk:Reward even though on paper R1:R1 it look good but in REAL market it's a different ball game... Which is why experience contribute to success. I am sure newbie who trade the market for 1-2 year can't possibly win due to lack of experience. But a 4+ year trader SHOULD be able to gamble ok... I'll let you choose: Option1: Risk1:Reward1 ---&gt;. Risk 100 pip: Reward 100 pip Option2: Risk1:Reward2 ----&gt; Risk 100 pip:Reward 200 pip Option3: Risk 1:Reward 1 ---&gt; Risk 34 pip: Reward 34 pip Option4: Risk 1: Reward2 ---&gt; Risk 34 pip: reward 68 pip I am sure it doesn't take a genius to see which "option will PROFIT the fastest and hit the stop loss the least" ---- Since I posted the compound for 15% daily gain in previous post.. I should post the "DE-compound for -15% daily loss" Attached Image (click to enlarge) The NFA 50:1 leverage have criple gambler so bad that it's so hard to lose fast money... As alway try in demo at least 1 month before you go live you will be surprise how long that 100$ will last you as long as you obey the "% MM" .

--- 帖子 #146 ---
oh sorry guys i forgot to re-post my image results. as you can see, this system CAN work. i wasnt doubling up here, nor using any stop loss, i was just running the test for fun and as you can see, if i had been doing the same RR rules and MM as Jysticim i would've defo made millions. also if doing this live i wouldve been a happy man now. but i ran same thing on the same two months 1 year earlier and i blew my account, again happened the next two months. You have to be lucky. think about it. you need to do a consistent 2:1 RR. 50% win ratio plus 2:1 is enough to make this strategy work. you can get 50% win ratio by random entry but as soon as you employ 2:1 with stops, your win ratio WILL go down to about 33% to reflect your stop outs. so you need an edge that will net you about +66% win ratio. employing 2:1 will bring that down automatically to about 50% win ratio, but this is enough. as you can see from my test here i was at about +64% win ratio, a bit of luck with consecutive wins (means i didnt need to hit +66%) and i quadruppled my account in two months.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
possible other combinations 1:1 RR with +55% win ratio "should" be enough. but it will take longer and higher chance you will be stuck in making money, losing money, making money, losing money, etc best is 2:1 but then you need to get your win ratio considerably higher, which with our 'random' entry system will be hard to do. also dont go "double or half", go "x1.5 or 3/4". its better. with 50% win ratio. both are essentially 2:1. for example: 2:1 with "double or half" - $100 start day 1: win - $200 day 2: loss - $100 day 3: win - $200 day 4: loss - $100 you can see the issue here.... can be perpetually stuck making money, then losing, then making, etc, etc 2:1 with "x1.5 or 3/4" - $100 start day 1: win - $150 day 2: loss - $112.50 day 3: win - $168.75 day 4: loss - $126.56 so you see here, same 2:1 RR, same days, same wins and losses but one account you end up with more money. hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
i don't feel it's wrong to take the profit and stop for taking a breather. at least what i gonna do is withdraw all the money and maybe use $1000 for trading again. i dont want greed takeme in and make me forget when i need to stop for a while.

The market is now open so it's betting time I was seriously wasn't going to share this but I'll consider this as "experiment" ... I have pick the Same candle everytime exactly at 5:00 ... my time not your time. So match the candle yourself. I believe this is the best time to enter two thing will happen after I show this screenshot.. #1 People band wagon and use this my pick time candle and bet my side? and that can either help or destroy my win... If it's true that more people know the better "volume" will help push toward my favor than this experiment is worth every penny of MY time.. If the conclusion come down making me Lose because everyone band wagon my trade... Then this will be the last thing I share any signal "about this system"... Because I rather you guy all lose money than me losing money... I want to be rich even if it mean all of your money is mine then so be it. With that said: The rules is same as the author: Entry Rule: You alway ENTER at the SAME exact candle close EVERY DAY. Candle bullish = Buy , Candle Bearish = Sell , Candle Doji (use your brain and bet with the long term daily trend) Stoploss rule: Trade #1 AND Trade #2 -&gt; Set S/L 34 pip OR previous daily High or Low (only if it's below 34 pip) : Meaning your MAX SL is alway will be 34 pip Take Profit rule: Trade #1 : Set TP 34 pip because of (risk 1: reward 1... Don't go fancy do reward 2 you have been warn) Take profit rule: Trade #2: NO SET TP, you will close out the Trade #2 at exactly 24hr no matter how much pip you win OR LOSE... Risk: I live in USA so my risk is max out 15% at 50:1` leverage. I have no choice here... So that mean each of my trade is : 7.5% risk!!! I post a screen shot now just to get people ready to jump on the band wagon. I will be playing with 100$ on LIVE account because I am not stupid.. 100$ that can win 27,000$.. more than enough for initial balance.

I just want to point out; while this is nice and all, when talking about probabilities in a 1:1 situation and getting 66 wins in a row is like asking for a coin toss with 66 heads or tail in a row in 66 flips of which the odds are .. 1 in 7.4 X 10^19; You're better off going hard and fast with leverage but i still don't get how the OP gets a clean -3.4 pips with soft SLs and no clear TP levels

--- 帖子 #154 ---
The author get a "a clean -3.4 pip" could be due to "holding the trade for 24hr and market retrace back to the original order where -3.4 pip is basically spread loss. You don't hold the trade more than 24 hour, you have to get out whether you like it or not even if it say -5 pip..loss.. As for the 66 win in a row lol, is just figure of speech obviously there is will be some loss in the mid 10 trades.. But it shouldn't be too bad. You and other people underestimate the power of "% leverage". But it's ok you will see if I can survive ..10 future trade with "each day I risk 15% MAX ".... This is an example of "clean small loss " Yesterday: Day 1 : July-28-2014 Result : -0.77 pip Balance: $99.66 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Today New Bet: Day 2 : July 29-2014: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

thanks for keeping us updated. it'll be hard for you to pull this off with such low leverage..... good luck, 1:1 wont be too hard to manage or maintain but i fear you'll keep getting stuck in cycles of losing money and earning money without any sort of real edge.

Hello everybody, I am back from a nice holiday. Below are the results of last week, traded with the normal rules and no TP. I included also the results when I started, from the 17th June.

Rules: Only trade this strategy when you already trade well. This strategy is for relieve of boredom. Leverage 1:200 Start with 100$ Trade The size of the trade will always be the whole account, you can use a lot calculator to calculate the position size. Entry For this strategy the entry needs to be as random as possible, this is explained in previous posts. Choose a candle arround the opening, not the opening/breakout, of a major pair, this is also explained in previous posts. For example entry the 2e candle after london opening. So if you chose the candle you are confident with you will use this candle time everyday. You enter the trade for the day at candle closure. If the candle is bullish you buy. If the candle is bearish you sell. SL &amp; TP 34 Pips is the hard SL, losses may not exceed 34 Pips. To gain and not break-even we need to use some sort of market analysing. We use yesterdays data to determine our SL. When yesterdays high/lows are in range of 34 Pips we use them. For example; today we sell so we look left and we see that yesterdays high is in range. The SL will be 9.1 Pips higher then the opening level. The TP is only more clutter/complicated for the most people here so for now we will leave that behind. Close Next day we close our trade if the SL levels are not hit exactly after 23 hours, thats the start of the candle you chose to trade. I hope this gave you a clear view of the rules. Sell Day 31( Today ): Open 1.34346 Close xxxxxxx SL 1.34435 Green pipping to everyone

Hi everybody, Let´s try this ... Open Eur/Gbp at 11.00 GMT Buy @ 0.79032 Sl (yesterday`s low) @ 0.79032 (22.9 pips) We`ll see what happened tomorow... same time Ronichimo

--- 帖子 #159 ---
@ RPM#105 Yes spread needs always to be included in the SL. @ Spyderman#108 You are totally right @ sinexcellent#111 For the leverage 1:200 the SL is 34 pips // 340 points. @ MolaRam#112 You are right about the EA thing, I made it myself. But for the leverage 1:200 you won't need an EA. @ TerryTibs#114 The R:R is not 2:1 because you don't use a TP. You can also gain more then 50% a day. @ sinexcellent#117 Where does that SL of 30.2 pips come from, what leverage do you trade because it doesn't even make any sense. Also a hard TP of 64 pips is nonsense. High profit with low risk is not achievable. @ civilpes2001#121 I am also a human ;p At the end of day 9 it should be 70,105. With this MM your account will never go broke. Will post more awnsers soon

--- 帖子 #160 ---
@ victor_ray Exactly, this strategy is only for the people that already trade well and want to do something fun. And if you understand the strategy you will never really blow your account. As last a TP of 34 pips is nonsense as it is based on nothing. If you use the TP rule posted previous and understand it well you see that is is only for beter results in low volatile times. Do you really think that this strategy is a gamble. Let's take a look. With gambling you will always lose money or you need to be the one person in millions that is lucky. You can't change the fate of your money when gambling at the casino. With this strategy you can, claim partially that luck with market analysing and a good MM. See it this way. If you would have an account with 10k on it you and you start trading with 1%, the 100$, you will never have a bigger DD then 1% of the initial account ballance. Because you have the possibility of winning/losing 50% of the time your MM need also to be this way. Next I will post the results of March this year, they are promising.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Glad to see you back in action can't wait to read more post from you Jysticim. Yes I have stated earlier that 1st-2nd year newbie have less chance of succeed while people with 4+ year experience...should do good. I do have a bit more time to answer Jysticim: I wasn't sure if you said: " Do you really think that this strategy is a gamble?" was referring to me or to everyone indirectly... But the reason why it's consider gambling is because "you say to risk your whole balance... high risk is consider a gambling" But to me NFA 50:1 leverage force me to only risk max 15% so risk 16% is not even an option for me. So in MY case it's just a "HIGH risk system"... As for the guy picking eurgbp... you are going to lose quit that pair now before you even lose more money. You have been warn.... If anyone here think they can win with non EurUsd pair ... dream on.... You also have been warn... (you will lose most of the time spread cost and sl hit) Later people, - Going to work now.

I am on my lunch break right now so I have a bit time to comment. People who think they can do different from the author will loses and blame on the author's gambling system is bad. I don't know how many people think that the system is &amp;quot;random&amp;quot; lol. Do you think we chose the same exact candle to enter and exit random? LolLet me tell you what I think.The author choose 5:00 candle on eurusd because that candle is the most profitable. Also do you think you will suceed if you choose the 20:00 candle? Loll. I am not saying everyone to believe what the author say. I markthe candle myself. And I see that the 5:00 canlde win. There is no random in picking the best candle.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
@ victor_ray Yes I partially agree with you. You can just pick a candle, as I said before you need to pick one arround the opening of a major pair as they have the most random outcome. There is nothing random in picking the candle but the outcome is.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Jysticim, Been pondering the numbers. Not sure how set you are on the 34 pip s/l. You referenced the Rags to Riches thread in your first post, so seems the idea is to get at least a 2:1 with some days (smaller stop due to daily high/low getting hit) less of a loss and some days hitting a higher t/p upon close. But you need...on average...that two times tp to sl ratio. If are trades are now time based (as far as take profit) at 23 hours then it would seem logical to expect, on average, to use the ATR as our expected T/P. Not to close the trade, but just for figuring. After all, that is by definition, the average range of that pair over a set number of periods. That being the case, we want our set stop to be 1/2 of that amount for an average 2:1. So perhaps it would make sense to have the set stop of 1/2 of ATR. That would obviously change with the pair chosen. You would still have days when the previous high/low gets hit before reaching the full s/l and therefore get you out cheaper. And you would of course have the homerun days when you hit a strong move and get more than your ATR. Changing the s/l to a factor of ATR would also change your leverage used accordingly. Not saying this would be a better way, but seems to make a certain amount of sense based on the time based nature of your system. Anyways...for what it's worth.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
@ spyderman I totally agree with you, Ill explain why I have the hard SL of 34 pips. You probably know that if you use the leverage of 1:200 you need to have the 34 pips hard SL to not have a bigger DD then 50%. Because the candle outcome is random and can go two ways you have 50% of losing/winning. You are right about that you need on average 2:1. But the problem when using ATR(is it not ADR?) you need to change your leverage accordingly and that is not possible. When you use ATR you would have leverage like 1:186 or something like that and that is not possible.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
ATR and ADR are similar. ATR is typically more accurate as it takes into account the "True" range of the instrument for that period, taking into account gaps from the previous close to the current open rather than just the "Daily" range which would not. As the forex markets are not as susceptible to gapping due to their 24 hour nature (most gaps only happen on the weekend), it's usually very close to the same thing. As to leverage...why can't you use 1:186 or whatever you want. As long as you don't exceed your broker's max, the leverage you used is dictated by the size of the lot you wish to open. If for example I have a $100 micro account (1,000 unit contracts) and wish to trade the Eur/Usd. At 1:1 leverage I can place an order of .07 lots ($100/(1,000 x 1.3408) At 50:1 I can place an order of 3.73 lots ($100/(1,000 x 1.3408 / 50)) The leverage is what I make it. Now if I want to risk 1/2 my account on a trade such as we're contemplating, I can still vary my s/l by varying my lot size. If I choose the 34 pip route and want to risk $50 then I make my lot size of 14.71 micro lots (34 pips x 14.70 lots x 10 cents/pip) If I choose a stop loss of say 45 pips and still want to risk the $50, then I reduce my lot size to 11.11 lots (45 pips x 11.11 x 10 cents/pip) In the first case you are employing 200:1 leverage (1,000 units x 1.3408) / ($100 account size / 14.71 lots) = 200 In the second case 150:1 (1,000 units x 1.3408) / ($100 account size / 11.11 lots) = 150 You choose the leverage based on the lot size.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
so now, not using two trades running at the same time? Because some posts back you said it will help to make overall balance higher by having TP of 34 pips and having one trade with TP of next days candle close. Which way are you doing it now? Two trades seemed better ?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
hi Jysticim, nice to see you back in the thread and yep i was aware you were not strictly going for 2:1 RR in your original post but i was just expressing that this is the ideal ratio we should be going for or at least moving towards going to. i think we should put in some rules for a TP level. ive seen many times in my backtesting that when sometimes price goes your way it may jump +80pips in your favour and then slowly start retracing back. if you leave the trade open and wait for the next day to close the trade sometimes you end up missing out on +40pips. i think we need to set some rules where we measure average ADR of a certain period and see if price goes, say +25%, or more past the ADR level in our favour, we should look to TP if price then retraces say 15% or something. it doesnt make sense to give all those pips back just because you are waiting to close the trade the next day.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
To cspip, It's better to split 1 max trade in to 2 trade so that way you at least have some profit if it hit 34 pip and whip back to original order. When that happen your exposure in risk wise is reduce.. so letting the 2nd trade run for 23 hr sometime can get lucky net 80 or even 100 pip... To TerryTibbs, obviously you can set the rule how you see fit and ignore the author rule.. but I don't see how the author set a new rule suddenly the market will obey..his new rule.. But way do keep in mind the author risk 50% ...of his balance on a 34 pip SL... that mean if the market goes +34 pip then he gain 50% of his balance... how greedy can you get man lol... you want 80 pip..? to ... gain 100% daily ? lol. Seriously aslong as everyday the market hit 40 pip... it's good enough for any high risk / gamble trade... you banking the buck.. It's almost the 23rd Hours so I'll be banking a nice % gain today...

From now on I will post log result with my excel because I am lazy.... I rather just take screen shot: I also attached the "excel file where YOU can record YOUR daily profit/loss and it will calculate the lot size you need to bet with the new Balance. I hope people can see if you want win you need to put in serious effort like this at least and apply to your OWN TRADING. If you don't like the gamble system, ok no problem. But without an excel log like what I created doing % money manage compound is a PAIN... By the way, the gain 7-29-2014 is a nice 8.73%!! which is expected since I am risking 15% everyday.

That's cool. Beats me. Victor, may I recommend connecting your FF account with your MT4 platform? That will save you having to do excel and screenshots.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
@ victor_ray Thank you for your Trade Log it will be very usefull, but we the rules you don't use always the 34 pips SL we also look at yesterdays high/lows. But as you only want to gain max 15% a day you need to change the SL of 34 pips accordingly. When you take 34 pips hard SL you will have max DD of 12%. If you want a max DD of 15% your SL should be 41 pips. But because you have a max gain % a day you need to get that 2:1 ratio and you can only afford to lose 7.5% and that is 20.5 pips.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
No that's not an option as I am risking 100$ within a bigger balance... Meaning I am playing a 100$ small account in a big account... So that's why I have to keep all track by excel and use "hard stoploss" to make sure it doesn't over risk to my big balance... And beside: I like doing screenshot it's easy for me...

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Well Jysticim, that's why if you or other people need to "change the daily 34 pip sl to 12 ..they can do it for that DAY ONLY. The lot size will calculate automatically if you change the sl pip to 12. So if Today you want to risk 50% on 12 pip. Just change the "SL Pip number to 12 pip" and you will have the correct lot size. Tomorrow if you want to to back to 34 pip sl. just change it back. the lot size will automatically calculate to the correct lot size. The excel I created is flexible. I do notice that when you change the sl pip all the "previous date lot size change too" Well you can alway just erase the math formula in the previous date lot size box and put in the manual lot size you bet at that day. So that way the whole excel column doesn't change previous date lot size. ---- Also Jysticim, I do get that if i set the lot size for 34 pip and I set my sl to say 20 pip, then I don't risk the maximum 15%. However, if I do gain 34 pip then I will get 15% gain. That's the goal. 15% or Higher if the 2nd trade run beyond 34 pip. If some day the sl is only 10 pip then It's a small risk WHILE i still keep the same volume that can allow me to get 15% profile while maintain risk that's below 10%. Although not it's not everyday you get a lucky candle signal that is near the previous daily High/Low. Also the like to do risk that way because time you go against the "trend randomly" and you don't want to be risking 50% on a SL of say 15 pip for the reward that's beyond like 75%... that's too greedy. I like play constant ly high risk . Not greedy risk. I have said before to everyone ... If you make 2% daily on "average daily" then you will be millionaire very fast. Ofcourse if you "aim for max 2% daily average" Well guess what ... some day you get 0.01% to 2% randomly... While if you aim for 15% daily average you might get day like this: Day 1: +0.01% , Day 2: +1% , Day 3: -5% , Day 4: 15%, Day 5: 4%, Day 6: -2%, Day 7: 12% So let add it all up = 25.01% total in 7 day.. Which is WAY better than 7 Day straight win of 2% = around 16% gain.. The sad thing is we are talking about average which mean you do NOT get 7 straight day of 2% win.. That's why high risk is better because OVERALL those "LUCKY RANDOM 15%" day will make up for the 4 days loss at 2% goal.... I hope this is clear enough for people who think...they can aim 2% daily average which is like not possible unless you risk around 15% daily average. ---- There is a saying: " Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star " quote by W. Clement Stone

@ spyderman Ye, I forgot that. Always used an lot calculator. @ Victor_ray I totally agree with you, I only wanted to point out that if you change the SL the previous days would change also. Plus I made a wrong calculation we still need to use the 34 pips SL to calculate the lot size only. We set the SL on for example 20 pips with the calculated lot size on 34 pips SL. A useful tool to calculate lot sizes http://www.babypips.com/tools/forex-...sitionsize.php . Always use the 34 pips SL. Sell Day 31( Yesterday, closed today ): Open 1.34339 Close 1.33996 Gain: 343// 34.3 Pips 343 Pips x (0.00001/1.33996)x(643$ x 200) = 329$ +643$ = 972$ Buy Day 32( Today ): Open 1.34016 Close xxxxxxx SL 1.33943 But with the upcomming news I doubt this trade will make it, we will see.........stick to the rules.

The results March 2014: From 3-1-2014 till 4-1-2014 Leverage 1:200 Start with 100$ SL 34 pips or yhigh/ylow No TP Total gain: 4323 Points // 432,3 Pips Ending 1361$ Growth: 1361% Biggest DD: 76% Biggest Growth: 6846% 3 losses in a row 7 wins in a row Conlcusion: The results are fair enough for 1 month.

Problem I notice on the thread: 1) The 1st post is unclear and need a Clear Neat Format that newbies can understand about the "system". 2) The author is not active enough in term of showing "chart example" of entry like "your rule say if candle is bullish how bullish does it need to be? not every bull candle look the same that's why YOU the author who experience in seeing the different type of bull need to take screen shot of those entry so people can learn how you see the bull candle/bear candle etc.. 3) You post your daily result in a format that many people are confuse. People don't need to see point, just pip is the standard notation is enough. Your 0.0001 math make thing look complex can confusing to the eye it make a pain to read your profit and loss.. --- If you make those 3 changes then people will be interest since they actually understand what they are looking at... As for me, I just want to point some of the "myth and fear that people think gambling/high risk system" can not win. Live order bet usually clear all doubt... because live result is the truth.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I think it would be fairly easy to build an EA to backtest Jysticim's and Victor's version of this strategy. I just wonder why both of you guys had choosen the "rocky way" (i.e. live forward testing) to find out its viability, instead of getting the answer within days...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I am sure that it's "natural" that before anyone play live, they have to do at least a "paper backtest using EA or Manual historic back test" and if the result is "promising" . THEN you would play live... You don't see me or the author tell people to play ANY PAIR. I am not sure about the author but I did back test other pair manualy and it does not win. Which is why I don't even WASTE time playing live on non eurusd pair. However, there are EA that back test good profit but FAIL in live because guess what ... "There is no guarantee that back test will produce similar result in REAL life.... Remember people the market can DO what EVER it Want at ANY TIME randomly. There might be a chance that if you back test other pair and FAIl .... when you play live you might WIN due to luck streak months... But I am not stupid to gamble live on something that Fail in back test... EurUsd does good on back test which is why I have "HOPE that live will be similar but no guarantee as alway". Beside playing live give you real money...

--- 帖子 #191 ---
i have backtested on six different months in random years. 4 tests were blown accounts, 1 was OK, but not millionnaire and 1 actually worked. odds are not that bad, it is certainly do-able. i think you need to just get lucky that the month you try in, the price behaves

@ victor_ray We have different candles and I post them live, my entries and stops. For example if the SL not had been hitted my close of yesterdays trade is in 10 minutes.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Thanks for the feedback to all about preliminary backtest results. I did not mean to find the Holy Grail by backtests, but if a 2-year backtest were a flop, then there would be no sense to run a live forward test. In other words, I would use backtest results only as a screening tool to eliminate "lemons". @Victor Would you mind sharing your backtest results?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I mark the 5:00 hr candle time frame and I get hind sight that "usually at this candle" is the deciding factor for the London opening direction... I don't have the ability to create EA that can recognize "many variation of bullish candle... my eyes know which candle is bullish due to 4+ year experience...." I post the picture daily chart just to show you I actually done some manual backtest, because I would have to post over...30 screen shot..of 1hr time frame which I am not going to do..

Could you post the excel sheet of these backtests? I'd love to see them in more detail. Edit: I totally just realized that there is a .doc file attached at the end of the post... however, is february missing?

@ spyderman I would love to see also other people posting charts if they want to. So we can determine better what needs to change, because yesterdays high/low is good enough but there is more to get. Are you already working with ATR of the pairs? I am still testing that out your idea and it is promising. @ aravynn Oh I thought that I already posted february before I went on holiday. Ill search the .doc for you. To update everyone. I am working on increasing results of the daily strategy with working with ATR and other pairs. I am also getting on the hourly.......would be fun to see the account grow 1000% a day, wouldn't it. Green pipping to everyone

I am using 1/2 ATR for my max stop. My first trade yesterday was the EurJpy. 82 pips made with a 20 pip stop. Discounted stop due to previous low. This pair takes higher than a 200:1 due to the 1/2 ATR being lower than 34 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also had the GbpAud. 72 pips with a 39 pip stop, so not quite double.

In the "universe" there is alway an exception rule to everything, because nothing is absolute. Human can't fly, the "exception to that rule is ... you get on a plane" but human still can't fly. So basically some day you have to "to see that that bullish candle is actually a bear candle" or even "reject that candle because the price action not going to in deep detail here. The only way you can "reject what you see on the chart" is only if you have enough experience in trading to project the future chart in your mind. But you still have to enter the "same candle" everyday because it's the rule. But how you see "the candle is bullish or even just ignore it is up to you ..." If you follow the "standard procedure without any exception" then the "MM % risk" would help you survive through random losing streak..... because it's Math. But to get more streak and profit you will need good market future projection experience.... Even though you are suppose to enter "everyday". But it's advisable do not ever play this strategy on non farm payroll friday.... the stop loss will just be hunt uselessly.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
@ spyderman Thank you for posting, could I get the ATR indi. Thanks in advance. @victor_ray Non farm friday is just really random trade.

I was eating lunch today, bore as usual decide to sit and think about ATR.......... I thought about it before when spyderman brought up the 1st time, but I was too focus on "there need to be reasonable room for sl" . THe problem with ATR before is that during low volatility time, it give indication of false range. Where I use Average Daily Range for a 20 day period which is small safer. But it's too safe... that profit doesn't hit often ..mmm.... However, after I ate my food and sit and really think about it.... If you set sl small pip AND tp R:1 atr... the 2nd trade could get Reward 2 for letting it run . While you still maintaining your usual risk draw down. Ultimately I end up seeing this will result in very much random result which COULD be in your favor on lucky days... Overall, I think using ATR is a good idea. I'll do some back test and see how it go. The Idea of the author can win... 1000% a day with ATR implement, is lol..(super super greedy ).

--- 帖子 #208 ---
@ victor_ray I am too backtesting and results are promising with my TP rule. Plus 1000% a day is not greedy, I will explain after I am home from swimming.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I am think if you use "Keltner Channels" , it might be better the just Raw ATR data... As reminder to everyone, when you use any indicator on your chart you must UNDERSTAND the math behind it before you can use it with confidence... I can just put up an indicator say here is indicator, put on your chart it show the channel range with "whatever hidden math" you need to believe the hidden math... With that said, here is info on Keltner Channels that I am sure that many newbies doesn't even know what the hell is Keltner Channel base on... http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...ltner_channels ---- Seriously I don't like to mess around with complicate stuff.. but I really hope the "future of this thread is not a system that fill with 10 indicators and 15 entry exit rule...." It happen on "99% of the forex factory system...thread" ...... But I hope this thread will not be one of the loser thread that just put indicator without a FULL understanding on the tool/indicator you are using... While I am at it, I am also looking at "some Bollinger Band variation..." for comparison... But I think Keltner Channel is the better choice ...

--- 帖子 #210 ---
@victor_ray I will definitely look at that. But first I will complete my backtest with the raw ATR data. I totally agree on the second part of your post, you need to know everything behind your indicators you use. I want to tell you something about greed in trading. I think greed is not taking every opertunity there is. For me greed is for example having in mind a SL of 10 pips, then the trade goes bad and you are already -15 pips but all your fancy indicators say that you are right and still not exit the trade. That is greed in my opinion. As last a good tip, everyday I go swimming at the end of the day arround 22:00. It is a good exercise for my body plus it is not that strenuous. In that time I review all my trades of that day, this strategy and my main ofcourse. What went bad what went good what can be improved etc. This will increase you trading results by alot.

ATR only works if you use my TP rule. Keltner ATR channel lags behind because it has EMA in it

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I do use your tp rule the one where you have 1 order st tp at Reward 1 and let the 2nd one reward x amount close at "23 hr" Obviously both 2 order all have same stoploss. As for the month June 2014, if I use your current "no TP" rule it wouldn't matter because 97% trade hit SL first because of the ATR reducing the SL pip small because it average a bunch of "small 1hr candle"............. The Keltner ATR channel use EMA as the price so it's more smooth and SHOULD prevent random spike skewering RAW ATR result. As for the lag, well indicator/all tool use historic price...to do compute average. If you use ATR raw you deal with same lag too. You do know that you have to set the "period for any ATR indicator" If you set ATR period (5) that mean it only "compute 5 previous candle of 1 hr" which make a sense of false range due to not enough PAST SAMPLE size...

--- 帖子 #216 ---
You use ATR over x amount of days so that shouldn't spike. I won't post alot today because I am very busy at the moment.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
why not increase candles for calculating ATR??? why not even use ADR instead? @ spyderman - what broker are you with? your spreads look nice for non-majors.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
This is what happen when I increase ATR...to huge ammount: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I do use ADR since live day 1. I picked EurUSd is because it's Average Daily Range is around 32-38 pip which is "match with the author sl 34 pip".... And beside EurUsd Range too....so usually my sl doesn't get hit.. at 34 pip even though I risk at 34 pip SL...

--- 帖子 #219 ---
seems it may be wiser to just use ADR then.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi Interesting thread, have you thought about using the daily candle bull or bear for direction instead of a random hourly candle, surely the daily would give a more defined trend. Cheers Eamonn.

Note3: the setting: K = 1 &lt;-- mean the top and lower band will be the size of full daily range. So use: K=1 , if you want a Risk 1: Reward 1 If you want to use the Risk 1: Reward 2 you need to set : K = 0.5 So that way you only risk half of the range which mean you will get SL more often because small stoploss...

Whatup, Normal set up for the day, 1:200, just use yesterdays high for SL Sell Day 33( Yesterday, closed t oday ): Open 1.33871 Close 1.33902 Gain: -31 // -3.1 Pips -3.1 Pips x (0.00001/1.33902)x(867$ x 200) = -40$ +867$ = 827$ We could use ATR for folowing trades then leverage 1:273 because we now use ATR. ATR is 50 of the EUR/USD because we need to get as close as possible to 2:1 we cut it in half so our hard SL is 25 pips. The accordingly leverage is then 1:273. We also use then the TP rule.

It's the weekend reflection time.... Starting next week, I'll be using Murrey Math Level to determine whether I should buy/sell at my usual 5:00 candle.

Q about last day Buy Day 3-29: Open 1.37839 Close 1.38089 Gain: 250 Pips 250 Pips x (0.00001/1.38089)x(1597$ x 273) = 799$ +1597$ = 2396$ Buy Day 3-29: Open 1.37872 Close 1.37872 Gain: 0 Pips 0 Pips x (0.00001/1.3872)x(1597$ x 273) = 0$ +1597$ +2396$= 3993$ Did you make BE ? If yes, then why? Coz u could earn extra 10.4 pips from second trade that you holding without TP. It was from open 1.37839 to close 1.37942.

for opening a trade in the end of the candle.it means the last minutes of that candle or last 4 seconds for example,or let the candle ends and then open the trade? regards fred

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Jysticim what period are you using for the ATR? For eg is it like the 21 day ATR or 14 day ATR etc? Also for March did you check the ATR value everyday and use 1/2 for the hard stop for every trade for e.g if on say 2/3/14 the ATR was 100 the hard stop for the trade would be 50SL, the next day ie 3/3/14 the ATR was 110 so the hard stop for the trade would be 55 etc. or did you keep the same ATR value for the whole month.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
According to the 1st post: the author said " - Open the trade @ closing level of the candle So that mean if you pick the 5:00 candle then at 5:00 exactly you make your bet... (but I don't get how can the author see the candle is bullish if the candle have zero pip movement." Or the author just look at teh previous 4:00 candle and determine it's bull/bear. I'll let Jysticim clear up that confusion. Usually at near the end around : 5:55-5:58 is when you can "see the shape of the candle bull/bear" and with only 2 min left it's rare the candle will change shape.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
No he said "Open the trade at the closing level" of that candle so in your example it would be the 5:59:59 price level. GREEN pips to all

Hi buddy, you are welcome

--- 帖子 #247 ---
thx alot to you zheng. can i ask you how to setting this EA? i've been trying using it now to backtest the strategy. but i think something is wrong here... my first SL is 400 points, but after that my SL become 170 point. how to fix this?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hello everyone, can someone please confirm for me whether today is a sell day at 1.34284?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Thank you really much for making an EA. I will test it out Zheng. @ fugly I used the same ATR for the full month. I used the ATR data from the indicator in the thread. I totally forgot to mention my trade. Buy Day 33( Yesterday, closed today ): Open 1.33944 Close 1.34263 Gain: 319 // 31.9 Pips 31.9 Pips x (0.00001/1.34263)x(867$ x 200) = 412$ +867$ = 1279$ Sell Day 34 Open 1.34204 Close xxxxxxxx SL yesterdays high: 1.34379 Green pipping to everyone

Hi, sinexcellent. Setting should be very simple. Rules：（Rule were a little changed to : ahead of one hour, in the closed position and the open orders. Of course, you can easily set the time. you need by adjust the parameters of LondonOpenTime) TimeFrame: H1 London opening: 9:00 (London DST,GMT+1) 1st Candle 9:00-10:00 (At the beginning of the candle we close the trade of yesterday) 2st Candle 10:00-11:00 (At the beginning of the candle we open the new trade) Buy if 1st candle is bullish Sell if 1st candle is bearish the original post Coin-Flip EA v2.0 Parameter Description: extern int LocalGMTOffset = 8; //setting Local Time Zone extern int BrokerGMTOffset = 2; //settine your Broker Time Zone extern string LondonOpenTime = "9:00"; //setting London Session Start Time extern double EquityPercent = 0.2; //Risk of per trade. 50% in the original post extern double HardSL = 45.0; //Stopless. 34pips in the original post extern bool DynamicLots = true; //Automatic calculation lots extern double FixedLots = 0.1; extern int MagicNumber = 777; Also, your stop is 400 points, it should be five quotes brokers. I have not tested, the hope that expert help check, plz

im using 5 digit broker. the first entry is right, it's 400 as an SL, but then the next one is 170. after it reach the SL, the next SL is back to 400. @_@

Consider this is a 80$ (note because you rarely lose all 100$....) so basically you risk 80$ per month for a chance of getting around 300$ for USA broker 50:1 leverage. OR 3000$ for 200:1 leverage or if you lucky 2 month in a row.. you would get 10,000$.... Obviously it's all depend on you having a job or not. If you have a job losing 80$ is not a big deal, consider this -80$ loss as ONE of the many 1000$ you will lose in the future. (what I mean is if you think losing 80$ is big now... wait until you own a 200,000$ account.. you will be losing 1000$ daily..on average so 80$ is nothing in the FUTURE so what's 80$ loss monthly now compare to 1000$ future daily loss average." That's how I view gambling..method. In the end you will make it all back when you are rich..., these are just "cost of business" need to lose some to get some. Seriously if you fear losing 80$ ...now you definitely going to have SERIOUS issue losing 1000$ ....in the future because you value money too much... ---- If you want a different perspective then think about this: What if I were to say : If you play the SAFE way... like 20% of the people in forex factory ( lol did you think I was going to say 95% ? lollll lot of newbies don't play safe oh no the irony.... the pro play safe because the pro fear lollll ) Anyway as I was saying, If you play the SAFE way (unless you have a HUGE capital which mean you either a Master or PHD etc.. or some lucky millionaire want to invest in you then you will Never be rich. If you want million gain you got to risk 1 million$... that's how it work in the real world. Warren Buffett is no exception .. He's very greedy when majority are afraid... You can't hope to risk 80$ to get 1 million$ do you lol.. the world will be a cube when you make that happen.... However, you can risk 80$ to get 80$ .. and then risk 160$ to get 160$ etc. eventually you will get up to 500,000$ account. Then you risk 500,000$ to get 500,000$ which mean you have 1 million$ in your hand.....

--- 帖子 #263 ---
could you please tell me what is your lot size for calculating the total amount(in $) earned or total loss(in $) incurred. I try to understand your calculations, I couldn't make any sense of it. Could you please post how much is the lot size for each trade. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
actually from my point of view, this strategy is much more better (i think) in binary then in forex. well the reason is kinda simple : pros : we call or put, just put the time limit. and its done. our risk is only the money we use to buy. we don't really care if the money is just different 1 pips, and we gain 75%-90% profits. cons : the profit is already determined from 75% to 90% from the money we use to buy different 1 pips from entry then we lose the money we use to buy. example : we buy 20 USD 1.3383 to "put" (i think put is for sell here) wait for another 23 hours. then we wait the result using this strategy. been trying using this for a couple days hope the result is as i want.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
This Thread and method is very interesting. #civilpes2001 with respect to the post#1 here is my understanding You just need to calculate the amount you would like to risk i.e 50% of your balance (say 100 $) In Order to make a loss of 50 $ with 34 pip stop loss, you will have to place an order of 0.14 Standard lot If you hit the stop loss the balance would be down to 50 $ and in order to risk 25$ for 34 pip stoploss, you need to use a lot size of 0.07 Standard lot. So before placing the trade, you can calculate the lot size based on the amount available and the amount you wish to risk. # Jysticim Hope the above is correct.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
The problem with a binary solution is that this strategy is based on a random outcome. The OP is making what is basically a random entry and then striving to tip the scales to profitability by having the losing trades lose less than the winning trades win. In binary, you're doing just the opposite. You're risking $1.00 (the losing side) to hopefully gain 60-85 cents (winning side). Obviously in this type of risk:reward you need to have your win % well over 50%.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
i'm agree with you. thx for remind me out.. you are right, we need high chance of winning percentage if you want to success in binary. (dam how come i forget as important as that)..

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Lol, I've spent my fair share on Binary trading...some good, some bad. Nadex is your best bet there. But that's another story...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Nadex offers American style binaries there the option itself is an asset that can be bought/sold at a premium. That means the outcome is 100% dependent on how the option settles. If the option is ITM, you can bank it and collect. For example, you can start with an OTM option for $10, let it get in the money and possibly sell it for more than you paid for it. Hence getting better than 1:1 r:r. If the option settles in the ITM you'd get paid the face value of $100 minus the premium cost which in this example was $10 netting you $90. A little less than because of fees. And as was mentioned, at settlement time you only need to be 1 pip beyond the strike price to be exercised. But the beauty here is why wait to expiration and chance the option getting ATM or OTM? Just sell it (or buy it back if short) and book the profits. IMHO, Nadex binary options are ideal for applying "coin flip" theory because you can get positive r:r instead of the negative r:r crap offered up by offshore/Cypruss type bucket shops. That way profitability is possible on accuracy less than 50% as long as the r:r is positive.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
If you can get better than 1:3, than why not open two, opposite trades and wait until you net 1+$?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
The problem though is that to get that $10 option on Nadex, you're going to have to be 50 pips or more from your strike price, and then you need to get to that strike to get the 100 or a lot closer than when you started to even double up. Not much of a coin flip. As I'm sure you know, to get an ATM binary on Nadex (which is what you need if we're really talking a coin flip scenario) you're going to pay around $54. So again your risking 54 to make 46. On a 50/50 coin flip...that's gonna end you up in the hole.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
You can get 33:1 on Nadex...I've done it before. Just not very often. It's a long shot at best.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
the EA does not open any trade as it should,why? regards fred

--- 帖子 #274 ---
here is the EA set up,if everything correct as it should be? thanks fred

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Well just know that you use 5 digit broker, and some EA are not code to apply to work with usa broker where you can NOT enter an order WITH a predefine sl and tp set. What I mean by that is... you 1st "Make a buy/sell order with NO SL and NO TP" . Then you will MODIFY the order to a hard sl and hard tp. Back in 2008 you are able to open a NEW order Menu and fill in everything : Lot size, SL AND TP .. in 1 screen . Then execute the order bam.. everything is set. This also one of the reason why I don't deal with ea any more because I am unable to code an EA that can modify the "correct" order after it has been bet... You can thank NFA regulation for that.

Sin... Don't want to derail Jysticim's thread talking about Nadex. Just search FF for "Nadex" and you can find several threads. If you have a specific question you can PM me.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
True statement. Jysticim has said over and over, "it's a random entry", just be consistent. As I mentioned earlier, I'm using the Tokyo open as I'm unable to trade the London. I have two pairs going you can see in my trade explorers. They may flame out...or not.

Well done Berda...

--- 帖子 #287 ---
has anyone checked the validity of the claimed performance? for example, i cannot replicate the entry/exit of day 2 on which 805 pips were reaped. i admit i have not backtested, but i believe a simple backtest may prove it is not (far from) as promising as Jysticim describes. according to its performance, this is absolutely NOT a coin-flip system that is 50% vs 50% with 1:1 on win lose size, which is of coz not the case here! here you do have 50% vs 50% win rate (approx.), but the losing bet is only 34 pip, but winning bet is average maybe 100 or 150, doesn't Jysticim realise it is absolutely NOT a coin-flip but a high positive expectancy system? in reality it is not, i believe, but why it won in July? because of luck, probably well, anyway, a backtest (very easy, now that you have EA) can easily prove who's wrong.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
someone help me, I confuse "- Trade @ the second candle after the opening of the London session (so you don't get disturbed by opening breakouts)." give me an example with times

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Uh just so you know live play and Jysticim 's trading discretion is beyond number. Just saying your profile said: Status: Backtest is meaningless (to me) You might want to remove that title if you want to people to believe that you believe in backtest.... What you read doesn't make sense because in Live it was probably different....... aka discretionary... rule breaking (maybe he was just sleeping)........ etc..... ------- Another tips just to save you "time" . Let just say perfectly understand the inconsistency notation.... Will that understand help you win (aka lot of streak win?...). We all know if you risk 50% daily and "on average you keep wining" , definately you can get 27,000$... I don't need to backtest to know that's possible... But what I don't know is the the future, if you value any of your life time ... you should just focus on getting those "streak"..by not doing random thing... Instead of verify YUP backtest prove 100$ into 27,000$ = lucky one time... So you will get lucky this month..... Better pray hard... ---------- I have told the author before to rewrite the 1st post properly, barely anyone can understand it with a bunch of "inconsistent" math notation.....

--- 帖子 #290 ---
whats the confusion??? London open is at 8am(local time) which is currently GMT +1 due to DST, otherwise it is GMT. so ignore the 8am-9am candle and trade the next candle. What is so confusing?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
you completely missed my point, and my signature title has nothing related with this discussion. even i'm a loser, my comments need to be judged with logical reasons, right? you are right that his 1st post is unclear (though i understand what he's saying), i'm just surprised that many ppl still follow w/o a clear layout. all his idea is this, use a system, 50% or so win rate, with 1:5(or 6,7, 8...) loser/winner betting size, one can run into a lucky streak and get rich. geez, you really think that's doable? yeah, show me live proof. btw, {a system, 50% or so win rate, with 1:5(or 6,7, 8...) loser/winner betting size} is not a coin flip system (ironically the thread title......), it is an awesome system that is N/A here in this thread. with such a system at hand, you need no such gimmick like 50% betting size to quickly become a millionaire. in other words, the system in this thread's 1st post won't give you what OP claimed.

@ Charvo When your entry is random the outcome has two ways. Or the market goes up or the market goes down = 50% chance of winning. Because you use yesterdays high/low you cut in that 50% losing. You still lose 50% but you lose like 10 pips instead of gaining 20 pips when winning. So when you have a winrate of 50% you still can gain.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
The market can also goes flat, so your stop can be hit when you go long and then you go short. The win can also be 0% with 2 losing trades in the same day, with 20 pips loss.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
When the market goes flat you won't get stopped out.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
That's why you have SL above the Daily Average Range... so that way market goes flat you either win..3 pip or lose 3 pip...

--- 帖子 #297 ---
hai Jysticim, good thread you have here, but can u update the first post? as i were reading through it, i get quite confuse about the coin flip system. somehow i managed to understand it. it will be useful for newcomers when they stumble upon your thread.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Since the rules are fixed, can you backtest it on previous few months to see the results..Somewhere I find results for Mar-14, but I think you should make excel sheet to demonstrate the results of any month

Had a trade going today on the EurJpy. 28 pip hard stop. Price moved 40 pips in my favor and then came back and stopped me out. Wondering about the advisability of moving to BE once distance equal to stop has been reached. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
This would take care of hitting the stops.. but on a day where you are supposed to ride on a trend, you might end up with a 0.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
But how often would the pair move your direction 1/2 ATR than retrace a full ATR to your stop...and then reverse and go your original direction a significant amount.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
No, breakeven will make price sl faster.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I think it is wise moving the SL to 20 pips into the profit, as you only need 20 pips daily in the long run (for 3 years) to be rich, after putting the SL to 20 pips then you can move on to another pair.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Don't just take random numbers, like x is better then y without a good reason. We take the numbers we show for a really good reason.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
On studying a different pair over a few months.. I found that if a t/p of 80 pips had been added it would have been hit a good few times during a day, where at the end of the day had reversed and only got less than half that amount. Granted you would not get those one off days when it goes up say 120 in a day.. but they are few and far between as opposed to doing 70 or 80 within the day.

I would have win on friday around 15% daily gain. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I like Murrey Math line. It help me put stoploss at "precision" obviously my take profit is "precision" also.... I haven't explain the method actually other than naming the indicator, but the "Idea of using Murrey Math Line" is to make sure you set SL below the Line (aka support.. it does NOT matter which line aslong as the sl is below "1 line" you have enough fighting chance for price to bounce back." Obviously your TP should be just below the "1 line resistance above your order". But remember though your risk and reward should be 1:1 that mean... if you set SL 17 pip you should set TP 17 pip no matter what. But if you see hmmmmm the tp line is at 15 pip because of the Resistance line is at 15 pip above your order. THEN you should just reduce your SL to 15 pip to match that TP line. But never set SL below 12 pip you going to lose period.... So some day if you must you can even do SL below 2x Murrey Math line. Which mean you have to set TP 2x above at Murrey Math line. Why have I chosen this path? Because I thought about it, if the market goes 80 pip in a day 15%...gain, or market go 40 pip 15% gain, or market go 120 pip = 15% gain..... I MIGHT as well get 15% in 15-20 pip and get it over with. I am TIRED of having days where I set sl 35 pip and the market doesn't go 35 pip. I don't care about losing 15% daily because you can't blow due to de-compound.... So if you set sl small like 15-17 pip... THAT MEAN that you have a chance of hitting stoploss early. SO if you KNEW that then it would make sense that if you set TP at 17 pip it might hit FIRST!! Granted it's RANDOM result on which path it will hit first your tp or your sl... But it's definitely much better than waiting for 40pip or no TP ...to get your 15% lol..... I do NOT have to deal with prediction future TREND B.S. I just need to see at this current point in time where is my NEXT support and resistance and AIM to profit that small range. This way I will guarantee a loss or gain 15% daily.... This has alway been about showing that using % compound/lotsize + MIX with random result... you may get lucky and win in the end. --- I Will post a PRE-Date chart so people can compare without having to go back to previous post ...(lazy people can thank me..for this) This below chart from 8-7-2014 . The line are PRE-DRAWN by the murrey math indicator (obviously with text lable so you can understand what price SHOULD do at these line). Even though with obvious future result there will be people just going to say just a bunch of random/fake support resistance that can never see the future loll... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi victor_ray: So basically you use the Murray Math Lines to denote where to place SL and TP. I see now, I thought that you were also determining direction, but that is not the case, right? Kewl thnx. We're working on the EA over a the hopwood forums site and so far we have the ATR thingy working. Next we will implement the MurrayMath thingy as well. Just needed to know exactly how you were using them. If you have additional info... let me know... If you can imagine it, then I can program it. LOL Peace to all Jess xmess777@yahoo.com

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Everyday at my candle in this case is 5:00 MY time, regardless where the price is in the middle of the 2 line or near the support / resistance etc. I have to determine whether I buy or sell at that candle. Most of the time the candle "bear/bull form" is enough for me to follow the candle path. However, some day I have to "intervene" even though the 5:00 candle "showing" bear... I might choose to buy (because of my trading experience). But for sure (let use buy as an example) the SL will alway below the 1x next support line. EXCEPT if the line is like 5 pip-10 pip distance, which is a NO NO. I will have to set my BUY sl at the 2x Support line below. Because I hate 10 pip SL it's going to hit whipsaw. For sure my TP will alway be Reward 1. There are some case where I will reduce my SL pip from within range of 14-20 pip just so that I can try to set my TP near the next resistance (using buy here as example)

--- 帖子 #317 ---
victor: Thnx for the info. I will keep in mind the 5-10pip exception and make the needed adjustment. As for "trading experience" that will not be factored into the EA. The EA will stick with the original rules. Thnx this further clarifies the approach... Jess

Day 9: August 11, 2014 Result: 16.44% Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Yup, another day of 15%+ gain on a measly 20 pip tp. I wonder how many people complain today is a slow day 22 pip range on eurusd can't win because no trend..... Once again my 20 pip (small stoploss did not get hunted like the majority fear lol.... do keep in mind that it's 15% risk SL on a small 20 pip ). If you want me to magnify in a big account example: 10,000$ account 15% risk = -$1,500.00 Loss per trade on a stupid 20 pip lol.... I bet many people won't even dare put a sl on a big account like that because of the obvious reason (broker hunt sl) All hail the random Murrey Math line... Do note as the the moment of market ATR... EU is very tight range around 30-35 pip daily. So technically if you set sl 40 pip you won't get hit sl. But that doesn't mean you can't have a floating loss of -25 pip... I hope people will understand that trying to aim for 30,40,50,60,80,120 pip is overated lol.... Learn to make money with high risk on small pip.... if you want to make a living... (because your house bill is due in 1 month...) you need to win everyday on average. ---- Long story short: If you play scalp you WIN 15% in small range/movement day. If you play scalp you ALSO WIN 15% in TREND day. SO that mean...everyday regardless of TREND or RANGE, you are guarantee to get money everyday... (lol sorry only if you are good enough otherwise you lose everyday ... but that's the goal people should be aiming for).

Day 10: August 12, 2014 Bet Loaded Attached Image (click to enlarge) Buy order, SL below 1x support line. If I make make my SL below 2x SL line then the order would have less chance of wining due to reward 1... So I "force my SL just wide enough at 1.5x level support, so that the TP doesn't have to go past 2x resistant level above. No EA can analyze this critical thinking this is consider outside of the box (analogy/pro/cons)

Nice thread Jysticim. I was thinking... if one was to start a new 100$ account each trading day and continued foreward simultaniously trading each account with the same rules. How many of those accounts would make it to, lets say... 10.000$? And how many accounts would crash and burn? (lost 100$) This could be tested with an EA, I would be interested to see the results, because if three accounts make it to 10.000$, they would even the loss of a whole year trying every day starting with a new 100$ account. (given that there are approx. 300 trading days in a year) Every account beyond the third would be net winner. What if you let the accounts rise to 20.000$... etc.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
A account will never lose 100$, you can always continu, you only have to invest once.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
That's true, but what i ment to say was, if you researched how many times an account would hit 10, 20 or 30.000 in a year it would show you the probability of the system, and also it could direct you to the months when the probability is bigger for the account to grow. Because in my opinion you need to have a good string of winning trades and it's important to know how many times a year they do occur.

Hello jysticim, your clear method histogram at the bottom of your chart is it repainting? can you post it please?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
What you mean, alot of work atm.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Sorry, my mistake. I meant Victor ray' chart

--- 帖子 #337 ---
The histogram in the bottom of your chart, is it repainting and can you post it?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I am not recommend you to use that histogram as volume.... If you want volume histogram you need to use "the sonic R VSA volume" which is the best ...volume. However, I hate "Sonic R system so much that I refuse to use anything they produce"....

Hello everyone, Thank you for this thread and the work on this strategy. I very much agree with the money management behind it. Many traders don't even understand the mathematical edge and start trading.. so nice to hear a professional approach for once ! My take on this strategy is that, obviously if the money management is being respected with perfect accuracy then it is a winning strategy. The volatility, the curve and drawdowns are of course going to be ugly and not the way a trader would like it to be but at the end, the edge catches up so it makes sense. Now : the signal is what will differentiate this strategy from winning to loosing if the signal can achieve &gt;50% winning trades. So, the current way that the signals are being given are I believe not the best... i mean if we think of how we can put odds in our favor, then we could work it out with a couple moving averages and other stuff which you guys can all figure out. What would that kind of strategy result for short term trading? let's say 1 day becomes 1 hour. and you take position on the 5 minute bar. ? I think there is a lot to explore here.. so maybe a EA is a good way to backtest these ideas to get vague idea of what it could give us. Looking forward to see more results of these days trading ! thanks

@victor which "settings" are you using? I mean are you using ATR/2 for SL? using the TP rule? Did you add something else?

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I use the Murrey Math Line as my "SL", and my Lot size is 15% of my SL pip... Just look at all my previous trade screenshot... See how I set my SL 1x level above/below my sell/buy order... My TP is minimum Reward 1. So if my SL below 1x Murrey Math Line is 17 pip, then my TP MUST be 17 pip or higher.... From the previous weeks of testing, it seem that it's better if you set Reward 3 pip higher.. So if you set SL at 17 pip then TP should be 20 pip... I rarely set TP above 20 pip anymore because it make no sense... if I am going to get 15% in 100 pip... I rather get 15% in 15-20pip.. The whole point of all this is: IF you think setting SL small like 15 pip will get hit faster... then it make PERFECT SENSE that your TP will ALSO can hit faster. The balance will not blow, it just de-compound smaller...... Suck it up and take the fast lost like a man..... your balance is not going anywhere if you are losing, but it does have a chance to gain 400% ...if you hit lucky win streak. ----------- Side Note: If you look at my Log from the post below: The 1st week from (Day 1 to Day 6), I played using the author rule 34 pip SL , and TP at 34 pip for order 1 and order 2 will be NO TP.... Result my account just drop..... without hope 5 losing streak in a row..... Day 7, is when I start applying Murrey Math lines for my "SL"... result I get a nice 50/50 ish.... instead of another losing no hope streak... This is the best form of gambling....guarantee 15% win / Lose daily.. no Trend? no Matter....

you will never make it with 50/50 with 1:1. I hope you know this??? that is the same result if you just randomly get in a trade whenever and do TP and SL at 1:1. This is like the "default" forex stats when you have no strategy. Ofcourse you can get the odd lucky streak, but not in the long run, you wont get anywhere. will see how your murray strat pans out, perhaps you can increase that win percentage?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Can someone explain why your account never gets blown with this strategy? I find it very interesting.. I'm talking about the original rules.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Because we are talking about risking a percentage not a fixed $ amount.Although, in reality, if you keep losing you will get to a point where your broker won't allow you to trade anymore since you probably won't meet margin requirements. But, theoretically, you should never hit $0.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Sry, but you have a big mistake within your thinking... If you lose 15% one day, you have to win more than 15% the other day to reach the same amount again...Greetings robcole

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Ok, thanks. I get it now. So that figure where the broker stops you, I guess depends on your leverage. But there would be an amount where you would need to reload for a new try: - which in effect is a loss. To be made up in future wins from the lucky streak.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Yes but that doesn't matter... since you can save your balance from blowing. As for TerryTibbs, "you will never make it with 50/50 with 1:1. I hope you know this??? " This is not a perfect world... either you end up with 60%win/40%loss OR 40%Loss/60%win............ That's how I see it, I'll give you example: if you win 5 trade and lose 5 trade.. and get exactly 50%win/50% loss ratio... What do you do to change the ratio? ............. Answer: you play 10 more trade.. if you get another 5 more trade win, and 5 more trade loss... Then play ANOTHER 10 more trade.. you keep playing until..the win/loss ratio change in your favor.. Or you just quit then your ratio stay the same. I'll show you what I see in my world.. if you hit a 58% lucky streak ratio, The graph show 262 day, and each day you bet an order risking 15% of your balance. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any pm or any inquire on how I "simulate these random" event will be rejected. I don't intended to share but I just want to show people that you can simulate random event in excel. I can simulate millions of possibility with 58% lucky win streak but.. forex factory will only let me post so much picture in one post.. Most of the the random result show similar profit anyway..... so kind of redundant to post million of random possibility result.

This is "MY money management" plan to get 1 million$ in year. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Obviously it work with any system, as long as YOUR system have a true 66.67% win rate with the exact sl and tp in the chart... you are rich period. I hope you like the big chart you can seem them spike... Obviously, I will not discuss any further about how or what I do to achieve the win rate on a "big balance". I guess in the majority people eyes, it's a just a big gamble.. I don't know about you but... I would gamble 3000$ if I know I can get 1 million$.... It's not a bad risk... since your 3000$ balance never going to blown 5% risk is just too small...(figuratively speaking) ---- Side Note: Sonic R system is not going to make you million$, go find your own edge....

--- 帖子 #356 ---
@ Vistor ray - well good luck with that. i dont discredit what you are saying in your second post. i too have thought about the idea of "gambling" $200-$300 a pop to make it big. i currently use a strategy that is netting my 75% win rate with 1:1. so it is doable for me. plus i have access to 500:1 leverage so i can risk much more a day. 25% a trade is a good amount. but i havent had the time yet to open up a sub-account with my main account to go for it yet. but i will soon hopefully. i will come back here to post the results, maybe a millionaire ..... we can dream.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Believe it or not, this is exactly how I made my first million in forex. You open a position risking almost all of the amount set aside and keep on adding. However, make sure 1) There is a really good Lifetime Opportunity, 2) any addition to original position should be well calculated because it will add more weight to the boat already only inches above the water. If you try ten times, need to succeed only once to get where I am right now ....................... over here: http://i298.photobucket.com/albums/m...3a44317fb0.jpg

Well why don't you just "play a small balance within a big balance..." as long as you use sl and % risk right... it should have zero effect on your big balance... I am risking only 100$ within a "big balance"...... That's why I had to record the "coin flip trade" in excel.. so that way I can keep track of the small balance... Attached Image (click to enlarge) By the way, I hope people don't think I am dumb gambling lol .... even though the coin flip gamble play is losing ...money. But to me it's just a small loss... I already made 200$ live in 1 trade so it cover the losing cost experiment... I'll stop all posting after I have reach... a heavily dedication of live play 1 month to show people you are not going to blow money just because you "risk 15%" per trade... Seriously though, this should the job of the author not me... I don't have to prove anything But because the author have good intention so I decide...to help out for 1 month.... Playing eurusd with the coinflip system does affect my Main Big balance system... because on the Main account I play eurusd heavily scalp. One month all I can spare to help the noobs out.... If you play other pair not eurusd you are going to lose using Murrey Math Line as SL...... (i already warn 2x on previous post...) Math is power..........

Dear Victor_ray Thank you for your contribution. It is always very interesting. I love to see it everyday. Do you know an EA which you can define SL, TP, 5% risk and Leverage?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Do not worry about : leverage because "5% risk lot size will be within 1:50 leverage"... It is not necessary for any system/ea to calculate leverage... (because of the 5%..is too small) No, I do not know any EA that "define SL, TP, 5% risk" But you can alway "manually MODIFY any EA code" to use the money management... The code is actually not hard... if you have "basic C+ knowledge"...... Ofcourse if you don't know the basic C+ programing knowledge then it's incredible/impossible for you. If you just use the Excel sheet I posted... previous post back.... or create your own..excel lot size/risk calculator... it is more easier..

Hi victor Ray, are you testing based on the parameters set out by the original thread poster?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
No, the first week was the result (day 1-6) from the original thread poster parameter. I saw the problem... which is "volatility is low" it's much better if you just scalp.... So from day 7 and up I , still enter at my usual candle 5:00 hr and set sl below/above 1x Murrey math line. The random is still there because "i am force to enter at 5:00 candle whether I like it or not..."

Dear Victor ray Does it mean you quit this strategy? Or will you update at the end of the month your results? I appreciate your input very much. Anyway thank you soo much. Wish you all the best kofix11

--- 帖子 #376 ---
unfortunately this is in fact a coin-flip test, what's a coin-flip? it is 50% vs 50%, and what's more, it is not free to play this game! and the outcome is quite obvious (mentioned my last post in this thread): it will not make money! no need to wait for victor's 1-month test...... people should not waste time and energy here, but people will, (like me doing now......) no hard feeling, everyone who reaches his target have to experiences this kind of traps.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
It mean I quit posting my result.... forever. The whole point of all of this is if you play % compound money management... you shouldn't blow the balance. But you STILL NEED a GOOD random win ratio for you to be rich. When will that happen? I don't know it depend on other people entry system. What I have provide you all is a live proof of % compound will not blow even if you risk as high as 15% daily and SL method using math murrey system (exit). After that it's all base on your "luck/your system ENTRY" to make you win... Do not think that you can't win if you believe in luck... If you really keep playing eventually you will get 25,000$ or even 80,000$ in 2-5 year with a 100$ investment... But I recommend people should be smart... and start with 1,000$ or 2,5000$ so that way you ... are more likely to get 100,000$/300,000 in 3-5 year... ------------ As for charvo, Some people do not understand that you only lose if you stop..... Example: Scenario 1: You win 10 trade you lose 10 trade.... = you (break even ..and lose spread). Are you happy with that? YES, you are happy? then.. you lose money. Scenario 2: You win 5 trade and lose 15 trade = you lose.. ARE you HAPPY with that? NO? Then play 20 more trade.... ( it MIGHT turn out to be 15 win 25 lose) Secnario 3: You Win 15 and lose 25 trade. Are you Happy with that? NO because you losing... Then play 100 MORE trade... You WILL change your result... The whole point is: Unless you quit, other wise you can keep playing until you win... period.......... Majority people don't get that your win loss ratio is dynamic... If you don't stop... you CAN change loss to a win... provided you still have money to play.. Which is exactly why we use % lot size... so you should have LOT of chances to keep betting for 100 trades... But if you just really unlucky, losing 80 trade in a row, then I am sorry forex is NOT for you because you were born with Destiny To become homeless and you should go get an education and get a high paying job (all though I am sure you still get bad luck not getting a job because you can't Fight Destiny. But at least education is worth a try ).....

Hi Victor_Ray just wanted to say thanks for all your updated reports I'm sure many will find it most helpful and informative

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Victor, i admire your passion and persistence on this method. It is the spirit that bring us to final destination. no disrespect from me at all i understand that mathematically, it will not wipe out since it is a % betting. but in long term, due to trading cost and almost 50% 50%, the equity curve would be a typical asymptote (approaching to zero, but never reaching zero) what's more, there's an underlying point that we often ignore in trading: time let's say after 3 months, you run into a sequence of 10 losses (very easy for this current method), and equity reduce to what level? it doesn't matter actually. what matters is you lose 3 months! learning a correct method for 3 months, you might be already profitable. this capital of "time" might be more important than money. in fact, i haven't so far seen any proof thru this thread that this method is not a random 50% vs 50% thing. how can we expect to make money this way? is the market really this easy? man, to win in this battle, it takes blood and tears instead of a smart finding of a method like this. my comments may be purely redundant since it simply helps no one among this thread's followers. i only posted because i've been there wasted and i hope the others skip it.

Hello to all! Can someone, please, explain me, how was it possible to achieve those results in first 5 days, if the drawdown at first 4 days was obviously larger than 3,4 pips (which was a stop out with 1:2000 leverage as Jysticim said)? Thanks in advance! UPD: Question closed. I have found the answer. Artem

Hi Victor! Can we get the usual updated about this week...?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Correct me if I am wrong or its been stated/explained already but I do not see how you had those pip gains. Open 1.35619 Close 1.35531 Gain: 8.8 Pips not 88 pips. On the 17 jun there was only 5 1 pips from open to close in total for the whole day, so I don't see how you got 88 pips in one hour.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
88 Pipettes = 8.8 pips

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I am sorry, but I have not read the entire post. So I do not know what has been said before. Can you help me to understand your maths. Sell Day 22: Open 1.35355 Close 1.35296 Gain: 59 Pips 59 Pips x (0.00001/1.35296)x(514$ x 200) = 44$ +514$ = 558$ Sell Day 22: Open 1.35355 Close 1.35296 Gain: 5.9 Pips 5.9 Pips x (0.0001/1.3523)x(514$ x 200) = 44$ +514$ = 558$ In the above examples, can you explain. If you gain 59 pips or 5.9 pips using the same 1:2000 leverage, this should result in more profit for the 59 pips not the same as 5.9, I don't get it. How can you make money if you made 59 pipettes or 5.9 pips and your spread is 5-8pips Also, what lot size are you using?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I did some calculations based on your original post: 1:2000 leverage https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets...it?pli=1#gid=0 here is the same calculations with 1:200 leverage. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets...y8I/edit#gid=0 As you can see, as soon as you have one loss its game over. I based this on increasing volume, I assumed you were increasing the volume after each trade based on balance. Your maths is wrong. There is a big big error in your calculations.......Is this a troll thread?
