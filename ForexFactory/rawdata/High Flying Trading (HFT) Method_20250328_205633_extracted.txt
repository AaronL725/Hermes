Dear friends, The only rule I have for being a part of this thread is that you must be respectful and kind to others. This means no putting other people down. Speak only that which builds up is a good motto for this thread. I want to share a very profitable and very simple method of trading with you. My name is Mike and Ive been trading currencies for over 10 years. Throughout that time I have made many mistakes and learned from them (you can still see some of my old threads on here, all of which I view as mistakes that I have learned from). Ive also discovered how to trade successfully, learning from many of you along the way. So I have opened this thread to share not only my method of trading, but to help you avoid the mistakes I made and to shortcut your education track to profitability. I also hope to continue to learn from others, as we all interact together. I am an airline pilot flying the Boeing Dreamliner 787 as a captain. In my 35 years of flying Ive learned that to be a good pilot requires that we master the basics. Our main rules are: aviate, navigate, communicate. This means we must always fly the airplane (aviate), never allow ourselves to be distracted from this main rule. Secondly we are to know our course and stay on it (navigate) so that we avoid terrain and other aircraft. Finally we must be in touch with Air Traffic Control (communicate) so as to obey their instructions and receive their help if needed. These are the basics, and we who fly practice them every single flight. Trading is like flying. There are some basic rules that must be learned and applied. It is my goal to share those rules, and encourage us all to fly right by applying them each and every time we trade. We want to get to our destination successfully, and to do so requires us to master the basics and not violate trading laws. My method of trading has a risk/reward ratio that is literally 1 to several hundred, sometimes less, sometimes much more. It consistently pulls 500-1000 or more pips out of a 100 pip move, all with a very small risk. How is this even possible? Its one of the rules of High Flying Trading, and I will be providing you with illustrations of this rule, as well as teaching the other rules, as we proceed along together. In this business, like flying, knowledge is power. In order to be successful traders we must continually be thinking, studying and growing. We must learn from our mistakes and learn from our successes. Think of needing to get a doctorate in trading in order to be successful, and that amount of learning requires much time and effort. Dedicate yourself to diligent study, careful learning from mistakes, and ongoing development of yourself in all areas. My method of trading is simple, very simple. One indicator only. It can be traded on any time-frame with any instrument that moves and trends. It can be traded in Frankfurt and London, New York and Asian time periods. And while you will find it extremely simple, trading is an art that can only be mastered through much effort and time. If you're willing to put out some effort in study, sharing what you learn along the way, then come and study with me. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight. More to follow as able

"It consistently pulls 500-1000 or more pips out of a 100 pip move, all with a very small risk." I don't get it...if I am right,this can be done only if you keep adding trades while move continues... Interesting,lets see.

"Altitude and Airspeed" Pilots know that we must at all times have altitude and airspeed. These are the two cardinal rules of flying, for if we run out of either one we stop flying. Altitude and airspeed. There are two cardinal rules for being successful in trading. They are very simple, and here they are: 1. Keep losses small. In flying it might be stated, never have an accident. This of course is absolutely critical in trading, too, for we want to live to trade another day. In other words, our trading must be careful to protect our capital first, so we keep our losses absolutely tiny in comparison to our profits. 2. Let profits run and multiply them . When I fly from Chengdu, China to San Francisco, California we are going from East to West and there is a Jetstream of wind that travels that direction. Our dispatchers will put us directly in that Jetstream to take maximum advantage of 150-200 knot tailwinds. When we are in a trend we must multiply profits, catching the Jetstream of the trend and riding the tailwind which allows our profits not merely to add up but to multiply. Of course there are many other rules. For instance: Our method must be simple. What good does it really do to have tons of indicators, Fibonacci retracements, support and resistance, big round numbers, half levels, candlestick pattern notifiers, trend lines, horizontal lines, fifteen indicator windows open, etc. While some of those things are helpful, and we can certainly reference them if we want to, we must keep our trading basic and simple. My Boeing Dreamliner aircraft is very sophisticated, with all the latest technology, and yet we use the same basic instruments that I learned to fly a Cessna 152 with. Our method should be logical. It should make sense, and fit in with sound reasoning. Being logical means it does not violate our two basic rules, it is consistent, it is timeless. When studying and learning different methods we should relatively quickly say "oh, that makes good sense" in order to know we are on the right track in our learning. Our method should be duplicatable. It should work anywhere where there are trends. It should work in finance and in fashion, in business and in industry, in all areas of life. This ensures that our method is sound and that it will continue to work in the future because it is based on the behaviors and patterns of mankind. Additionally, we must treat trading like a business. We often spend many thousands of hours and dollars learning our profession, and we should think of trading in the same way. Trading successfully requires us to learn and practice, investing time in our future business. One thing I like to do is write down every mistake I make, stating what I learned from it and what I would do differently next time. This is a carry over habit from my early days learning to fly, I still do this after each flight today. And I have done it for 10 years in trading. We want to be part of the 5% of traders who make it, so we must treat trading as a business. Would you want to fly with someone who treats flying as a hobby, tinkers with it to pass the time, or someone who is serious about it and has invested the time to learn it right. There are more rules to trading, and on this thread you can feel free to add your wisdom. Collective wisdom is so much greater than any one person. Altitude and airspeed. Two rules we cannot break. Keep losses small, let profits run--and multiply them! Two rules we cannot break. Our trading method will take maximum advantage of those two cardinal rules. The next post will illustrate these two rules, with pictures that show my trading method, as soon as I'm able.

Post 3: Illustrations I am now going to show you a series of illustrations, highlighting and explaining my method. It’s important to understand that my way of trading is only one way, I'm sure it is not the best way. This is why I took a few posts in the beginning of this thread to share the overall objective, the big picture, the 40,000 foot overview of how to trade. Now you can take and modify things to suit you, to fit your objectives, and to coincide with what you already know about trading. We always want to keep the big picture in mind: our objective is to get from Point A to Point B safely, that is, to not blow up our trading account and to trade profitably. When considering entering the market we want to enter on the start of a trend. We can add to our position as the trend moves, but we don’t want to make an initial entry halfway through a trend. We will consider our initial entry our departure airport. We want to depart at the departure airport. At the beginning of a trend. Of course this will mean that we may have several small losses while looking for the trend. There are several things we want to do to help mitigate these losses, such as keep our position size small, spread out our trading capital over numerous currencies (some will range and some will inevitably trend) and keep a tight stop loss at the point of the previous swing high or low. There are other things, and feel free to add some as the thread moves forward. When we are at the gate ready to depart any number of things can go slightly wrong to delay our departure. Weather can delay departure, mechanical problems can arise that take time to fix, baggage loading can sometimes cause delays, etc. I’m sure you’ve experienced some or many of these things. They can be costly to an airline but they are part of doing business. Small losses while looking for a trend are part of doing business, and must be accepted and even embraced (because we are one trade closer to the trend). Not every flight departs on time. If you are looking for a system that takes no losses then you will want to continue your search. But if you’re willing to accept small losses to make large gains then continue studying here with me. When I take a small loss while looking for a trend it tells me I am one trade closer to departing and flying high and fast. I have a good friend who has a food truck business. He drives his food van to fairs and civic events where there are lots of people. On good days he can make thousands of dollars in food sales (and he and his wife are fabulous cooks). One good weekend and he is rolling in the dough (pun unintentional), making money hand over fist. But he lives in Iowa where the winters can be harsh. It is during these cold and snowy winters, where very few people come outside to purchase food, that makes him or breaks him. He must not purchase a ton of food during these times or it will spoil and he will have large losses. He must manage this time with small losses in preparation for summer when he will catch a tailwind and make a ton of profit. This is simply how business works. And it is how trading works. What I am going to do now is show you some trades using a 4 hour chart. I just picked 4 hours for illustration purposes. I like to trade the daily timeframe, due to my schedule, but occasionally when I have time I’ll trade for a day on 15-minute or 30-minute timeframe. The timeframe is up to you. On the chart I am posting I am showing how I get into a trend. You can use any method you want to find the initial trend: moving average cross, stochastic cross, trendline break, support/resistance bounce, round number touch, alignment of stars and moon, and the list goes on and on. The reality is that the method of getting in to the initial trend is not very important. It is how you manage your trade once in (keeping losses small, letting profits run and multiply them) that matters. I use a 34 SMA (smooth moving average) cross as my entry point. It is very simple. Sure there will be false signals (maintenance delays, weather delays, etc.) but it will ensure that we do get into every trend, and do so close to the beginning. This is what we are after, for as you are about to see, once we get into the trend we are right in the middle of the 200 knot tailwind and we will fly high and fast to profits. Some people will want to start adding indicators to mitigate the whipsaw of the initial entry, and that’s fine. Some use RSI or Stochastics, or other oscillators to try to mitigate their risk on entry. That’s ok, every business needs to try to look for ways to cut costs. But I doubt you will find a way to eliminate false entries entirely. Even with all our modern technology, our departures can still be delayed at times. If you want to post your current method for reducing false entries that’s ok, maybe we will all learn a better way. I’m merely posting my way, there are probably better ways. But I have tried all the ways mentioned above (and many more), and while they might eliminate some false entries they also eliminate some good entries, and that we cannot afford to do. My friend in Iowa cannot afford to miss a nice, sunny day selling food at the fair, it would cost him thousands of dollars to do so. I’ve attached the chart, which shows a basic entry, and in the next post I will show how we let our profits run—and multiply them. I will be posting numerous charts so we get the idea of how to let profits run—and multiply them. Then, I will begin posting my method for keeping losses small.

Great to meet you. What did you fly?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Dreamliner, thanks for sharing your method. I have followed your postings for a long time now, and always found them to be very informative. I am really interested to find out more, especially about using the Daily candles where you say you have had success. Many pairs are approaching the 34 SMA right now; I don't even know how anyone could have caught the move on USDJPY However, perhaps you have seen where EURAUD is right now? Any chance of using that as an example of how we may trade using your method? I believe it has potential for all of us to make some pips. All the best, John

--- 帖子 #46 ---
You're certainly welcome to your opinion, though stated prematurely without viewing all the evidence. One wonders if rash judgments are the norm. If so, I would simply encourage a hearing out of the evidence, on all things in life, before coming to hasty conclusions. It will prevent one from looking foolish in the end. I'm very aware of typical moving average systems, their drawbacks and problems. All posters can be the judge of whether or not this is a typical moving average system, once all facts are in.

Well then present the facts I can only judge what's given to me and so far that's all you gave no offense

Yes, this is exactly right. In the winter months (except holidays) people simply stop flying and all airlines struggle greatly for a profit. But those who manage winter months carefully are in for a winfall in the summer months. That's business. That's trading.

You say the system gives good risk reward (1:100 or more) What hitrate do we expect from this?

How to take advantage of a trading tailwind. When we fly East to West our dispatchers try to pick the most advantageous route and altitude to put us right in the middle of the Jetstream. We can save sometimes two hours or more (on long routes) by flying directly in the tailwind. Our technology tells us what the winds are like at different altitudes, and we try to maximize the tailwind. The reality is that most routes we fly from East to West take advantage of the Jetstream tailwind. Likewise in trading you can follow a trend and make money in that trend. But our airline wants to maximize the tailwind, so we not only fly the correct route but also the optimum altitude. We are maximizing the Jetstream. In trading we not only want to follow the trend we want to maximize our profits in that trend. Again there are lots of ways of doing this, and my way is only one way. Some people add positions on retracements, or at key levels or upon touch of a moving average, etc. These are all good, and there are many more ways. You can share your way of adding to your trend if you like, we can all learn from you. I take a very simple approach. I add on to my trade whenever there is a candle that closes opposite to the trend. A bull candle in a bear trend is a retracement, and is a reason to sell high (in comparison to what the price just was). A bear candle in a bull trend is a retracement, and is a reason to buy low (in comparison to what the price just was). On my initial entry I usually do not move the stop loss. It stays above the previous swing high or low. Not moving that stop loss allows that initial entry to catch the entire move from top to bottom in a downtrend or bottom to top in an uptrend. My subsequent entries, however, have no initial stop loss (if uncomfortable with this, you can always place a stop), and will be closed upon either of two conditions being met: First, if the market closes above the SMA I will close this trade. Second, I wait for the market to move in my favor a small amount (sometimes as little as 10 pips, depending on the market) and then place a stop loss at breakeven plus cost (spread). Since I start my trading day at 5:00 PM Pacific Time I do this manually as the market moves before I go to bed. But I’m sure there are EAs that would assist you with this if needed. This means that these subsequent entries have no chance of taking the entire trade into a loss (remember, we have a position on at the beginning of the trend that is in profit), a medium chance of running with the trend clear to the end, and a larger chance of just breaking even. In other words, there is no risk to adding on positions like this, and a chance for a large reward. No risk, large reward trading is what we like. It is part and parcel of our High Flying Trading method. If you examine any trend you might question why we place a stop loss on these add-on trades at all. After all, adding on these trades clearly would bring in profits in a real trend, taking advantage of huge Jetstream tailwinds on our flight. Indeed, you may choose not to set a break even on these at all. Backtest it, study it, decide if you want to use this method or let them run, or maybe come up with another method that is different. The reason I set the break evens on these add on trades is because of rule number one: keep losses small. Sometimes, when the trend gets extended price will come back to the SMA, and all those trades coming back to the SMA will be losers. The reason to not set break evens on these add on trades is because of rule number two: let winners run—and multiply them. In a good trend these add on trades will produce hundreds and thousands of pips, literally compounding your profits on the way to your destination. So which method should we use? The answer is up to you. I will sometimes not place the breakevens on the add ons near the beginning of the trend, and will place them on the add ons later in the trend, when the price gets quite a ways away from the moving average. Experience will tell you which to do. If you are new, place the break evens and take the chance that some trades will only break even that could have produced much more profit for you. At least you are keeping losses small that way. More experienced traders will just “know” when to place these break evens on their add on trades, as the market is very far off from the SMA. Here is the chart with the reentries: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Next Post: Results of this trade

Trend Summary: In flying I want to maximize the tailwinds, flying the route my dispatcher has programmed that contains the strongest tailwind, and sometimes changing altitude to pick up more of that wind. This gets us to our destination faster, saves thousands of pounds of fuel, and makes the airline more profitable. In trading we want to maneuver so as to take best advantage of the trend, which sometimes has the effect of netting ten times more pips than the trend itself. When my friend from Iowa knows that the next week will be sunny, and that the fair is expecting a record crowd, he will maneuver carefully so as to take best advantage of the circumstances. He will stock up on food, make some things ahead of time, hire an extra helper, etc. He knows that this one week at the fair could bring in a year’s worth of income, if he works it correctly. Trading works the same way. We must be very careful not to take big risks (rule #1) and we must let our profits soar—increasing, multiplying and compounding them at every turn (rule #2). We know that one good trend can hugely affect our trading business’ bottom line. Here are the numbers from the above trend: Total trend move: 570 pips Total pips gained: 5379 Total risk: 12 pips (previous swing high) Risk/Reward ratio= 1/448 26 winners 6 losers On a standard account: $53,790.00 (minus spreads ) This was a nice descent into a smooth landing. Is this an average trend on the 4 hour timeframe? I don’t believe there is such a thing as an average trend. Trends are like the people they represent: big, small, short, tall, marathon runners and couch potatoes. I only chose that trend because it was the latest one, occurring just this month, January 2016. In this case we did not use the break evens on the add-on trades. Had we added those break evens we would have lost less and won less. Overall it probably would have been less profitable in this case to use the break evens. Sometimes it will be better, in saving some losses; other times a little worse in giving up some profits. It’s up to you. This trade also shows that, while we try to minimize losses trying to find a new trend, we can afford to take numerous small losses (well hundreds really, if we had to) while searching for the trend. We may get a few whipsaws, or many whipsaws, but as Ed Seykota says, “one good trend pays for them all.” Inserted Video Here is the chart of the results of the trend trade: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Next post we will look at the trades immediately following this one, and learn something very important about our psychological makeup when it comes to trading.

Whipsaw: the Importance of Being Deliberate and Methodical One thing that is drilled into airline pilots is the need to be deliberate and careful, sometimes even “slow” in our decisions. In the simulator we practice handling abnormal situations and emergencies, the point of which is to teach us to be deliberate, think through the situation methodically, analyze the problem carefully, go through our checklists not missing one single item, consider our resources and utilize all that we have. Captains, especially, are tasked with keeping “the big picture” in mind. We are to keep the main thing the main thing. In trading we must learn to think logically and deliberately about our method. Take your time to think over the big picture of trading and learn to keep the main thing the main thing. Realize that in an abnormal situation, such as price retracing toward our stop loss, and then another stop loss, and another, we should not be in a panic. Our stop loss is in place, and we are not concerned about it in the least for we know stop losses are part of our “operating costs” which every business has. Last year a foreign commuter plane crashed and killed all onboard. It turns out that shortly after takeoff an engine failed. The pilots, rather than being deliberate and methodical, and probably acting on adrenalin, reached over and shut down the only good engine remaining. They were no doubt thinking they needed to “feather” (shut down) the engine that had failed and was windmilling, causing drag. But in their haste they shut down the wrong engine, the one good engine. Learn to be careful and deliberate in your trading, logically thinking through your trading plan and following it consistently, not being reactionary or acting on impulse. Flying, done correctly, should be boring. So should trading. Now let’s examine our next few trades, the ones that came immediately after the trend discussed previously. I think you’ll see why I began with the instruction about the need to become deliberate and logical in following our plan. The very next trade gave us 2 indications that it would be a dangerous trade. Not that we wouldn’t take it, we take every trade, but we should be wise in the way we use our money management. So the 2 indications of danger up ahead are: 1. The SMA is still sloping downward. This means the move lower may not be over yet. 2. The distance between the entry point and the previous swing low is very large. Whereas the previous trade had a 12 pip risk this trade has over 100. These two things make us cautious on this trade. Cautious, in my mind, means we reduce our leverage for this trade, trading with less units (I use Oanda as my broker that lets us trade in units, rather than lots). We have not talked about money management yet, we will do so in future posts, but right now we just need to recognize the warning signs when we see them and be prepared to act cautiously. This next trade, the long trade in the yellow ellipsis, lost 70 pips when it closed below the SMA. It is the cost of doing business. We have just made 5379 pips, now we lost 70 pips. This illustrates our two rules: keep our losses small and let our winners run—and multiply them. How many of these 70 pip losses would you take in looking for a trend? Of course we could take many of them. This whipsaw does not give us sweaty palms or shaky knees. When we are sitting in the airplane at the gate and get notified of a ground stop program in effect due to weather, we calmly accept that as our fate for that flight. We will be delayed. It is part of flying and not something to fret over or get angry at. We will still depart, it will just be later. This is the way we must look at stop losses. Our trend is delayed, there is some cost to it, but we will depart. The next trend will come, and we will catch it right from the beginning, right at the departure airport. Even if we had numerous of these whipsaws, with each one we know we are getting closer to the trend, so we press forward. The worse the situation looks the better we feel about it, the more we anticipate victory just up ahead: "Hard pressed on my right; my left is in retreat. My center is yielding. Impossible to maneuver. Situation excellent. I am attacking. Attaquez!"- General Ferdinand Foch (to General Joffre during Battle of the Marne) Some people would say to only take the trade in the direction of a higher moving average, which would have eliminated this loss. That’s true, and that’s perfectly acceptable. However, that method would also have missed the next trade, which we could not afford to do. Others will use different methods of getting in the trend, such as a trendline break. Perfectly fine. The point is, get in early. Finally, some people would say to wait until the market makes it’s breakthrough of resistance (in this case the moving average) and then retraces back to support. That is a very valid way to trade. I do not trade that way simply because we would have missed the entire next trade (and it is still running). We must not miss trends. Here is our next trade, the losing trade in the ellipsis: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Next post: the next trade, and we will learn something about flying that not many people know, this time using the example of a rocket. Any guesses?

Trend Results: Before we discuss the results, let’s think about something regarding flying. This time using a rocket as an example. If you’ve ever seen a rocket take off you know that right in the beginning it exerts a whole lot of energy but doesn’t move far or fast. As the engines/rockets roar they are burning huge amounts of fuel, far more than at any other point in the rocket’s journey, yet it is barely moving. Then, as the rocket gets airborne and begins its climb it “throttles back” at a certain altitude so it begins burning a lot less fuel, expending a lot less energy. And yet it is now moving at hundreds/thousands of miles per hour. Finally, once that rocket gets into orbit it is expending no energy whatsoever, it is orbiting at a very high rate of speed without any burning of fuel or using of energy. Remember this when you are just starting to get in the trend. This is the time when you will burn the most fuel (pips) and could be making no progress. You might go through one stop loss after another, seemingly wasting energy while going nowhere. Once you get airborne into the trend, and begin adding positions, you find that your profits are compounding, almost like they are on autopilot. If the trend lasts, you will be orbiting. Here are the results of the previous trade (which is still open). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Next, we are going to examine some of those times when we are first trying to launch, where we go nowhere fast while using lots of pip-fuel. But this post will not be until I get home (flying from Chengdu, China to San Francisco right in the Jetstream).

Hi Dreamliner, Congrats on your new thread. An interesting perspective on trading from a pilot. As for using Moving Averages: Any moving average can be used for trend trading. Shorter MAs : (+) Early Trend Catching, (-) More whipsaws Longer MAs : (+) Less whipsaws, (-) Late Trend Catching As for re-entries on opposite candles, its a bit dangerous. Here are other options I prefer: Re-entry on a touch of a faster MA (say 5MA) Re-entry on a Fractal Break in the trend direction Note about re-entries : They should never be at a price better than our last entry. Example : If we are in an up-trend, our next buy should never be at a price lower that our last re-entry. Thanks again for sharing, Khalil PS: I am available (as my time permits) if coding might be required, specially on short time frames.

Wooooooow, its a interesting system....!! Im a newbie, but is clear for me.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I've got a question; it was very clearly stated the the 34 Smoothed Moving Average is used However, comparing the CAD-JPY 4 hour chart, as in the example, I cannot see the Smoothed MA lining up there But the Simple MA does' anyone else notice this? See my chart. Also, I used the Close as no other detail was provided; we need this point verified also. Thanks very much

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Great post on the need to take every signal, and keep the stops small. The question that will be asked soon enough is going to be what to do when the MA goes flat. Is there a max number of attempts per day or per bar? Do you SAR at loss at the anticipation of the continuation of the original trend?

Hi Dreamliner! Thankyou for sharing your trading method I was thinking if we face to a volatile market as this screen shot what will be happened next?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
..​my chart looks like yours

--- 帖子 #66 ---
thanks very very informative please what currency you recommend to trade thanks

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks Captain. I am glider pilot. We drop height to raise speed. It is trade reentry formula. Please carry on interesting information.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Dreamliner - are you saying that you traded this chart with these entries in your Live account with what Ed Seykota might call " a meaningful amount of money " ? Ed defines " meaningful " as an amount that makes the profits worthwhile (for example, if you are on a senior pilot's salary, trading microlots would not meet this definition).

Hi DreamLiner! Thanks for the posts. I read all post and here to understand caching early trends.

This IS the question!Ranging market always is a problem with ma, wait for your answer capitan!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Ranging market I avoid by no two trades open at same level+Gap. My two cents.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thanks for your kindness for sharing your strategy to all of us. .... Btw is there any tips to avoid OP on ranging market ?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
this looks good. BUT WHAT IF ALL YOUR TRADES ARE wrong?? If you entered all a sudden Opposite move occurs?? Do you place SL on all the trades???

--- 帖子 #74 ---
the problem is, you dont know when the ranging is going to occur. You will only know after it happened.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
See cap'n ? What'd I tell ya?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Dreamliner You did say to put in any ideas etc so heres a couple that might help.... As you know I trade the 1 minute as a standalone strategy so have developed a pretty good entry system when you find a strong trend using my CCI indicator or "Clives C-piont Indicator" as I like to call it... Its very useful for identifying the peaks in a down trend and the dips in an uptrend, eg the ideal places to enter your add ons... All I do is wait for the CCI to swing against the trend and when it turns back then put a pending order under that candle , call it the signal candle..when the trend resumes it will enter you with the trend...I often trail the sell stop below your green pullback candles until hit.. I've marked most of the signal CCI candles in the chart below... The second suggestion is to use a currency strength meter to identify the best pairs for your strategy. My own CSM indy is top right hand corner. Just look to trade the top two against the bottom two so giving you the 4 strongest/weakest pairs , in this instance that would be CADJPY ,CADCHF, AUDJPY and AUDCHF. Chart below is the strongest /weakest CADJPY ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Indicators below if anyone wants them... Hope you're ok with me making a couple of suggestions, if not let me know and I will remove post immediately... Good luck Clive..

I assume you use a U.S. broker. How do you trade this method considering the FIFO rules?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Yes I noticed it as well.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
​Are you using multiple accounts? My broker plays by the F.I.F.O. rules. I can add to an existing position, but I have to close the original position first, which blows up this strategy without multiple accounts!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Boy this would be one serious kick arse method, whats the likely DD?

Excellent thread, Dreamliner!! A very simple and effective method. As Bruce Lee once said "simplicity is the key to brilliance"

--- 帖子 #83 ---
This is my concern as well.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
SMA = Simple Moving Average. I think the captain simply misquoted when he said "smooth". If you place a "Simple Moving Average" on your chart you will see it matches what he has on his charts.

Excellent addition as usual, Clive, to a promising looking system, thanks Dreamliner, I will be backtesting and seaching for a few entry points and hopefully add some benefit to the thread. Forget the Big Kahuna's, limit your losses and the $$$'s will come!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Dreamliner, Doesn't FIFO rule interfere with your trade management technique? E.g., add-on positions not being closed when b/e SLs are hit...

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Misquote or not, that simply is not good enough coming from the pointy end of the airplane! I expect a smooth ride from our fearless leader. And I did place a "Simple Moving Average" on my chart - you did read my post right? But if I go with that, then I am making an assumption, correct? It may mean other things that are written may be incorrect or not, depending on your interpretation. The third thing pilots do is "communicate" to clear up any issues and that is where I am at; let me speak to the Control Tower. Thanks for your attempt to help, John

Here's one that uses a 34 ema for a trendless market. Also has a couple of filters. http://www.onestepremoved.com/swing-trade-trendless/

--- 帖子 #105 ---
If the trend lasts, you will be orbiting. Here are the results of the previous trade (which is still open). {image} Next, we are going to examine some of those times when we are first trying to launch, where we go nowhere fast while using lots of pip-fuel. But this post will not be until I get home (flying from Chengdu, China to San Francisco right in the Jetstream).[/quote] Dreamliner gets it right here regarding the jetstream but oddly I can't see his trade which he claims is open. This is an Oanda account. That aside I am wondering how he knows which pair to trade since you never know when a pair will start to trend. If he has a few favourites you could still miss it. Also he must be splitting his trading capital in tenths or less to keep adding to the trade. He's caught my interest though.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
very very good i do used the same indicator

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I don't get what you mean there; isn't he just showing the chart and the long entry points on the CAD-JPY chart and then stating the trade is still open? He is not showing his actual account; is that what you mean by wanting to "see" the open trade? And what has Oanda got to do with it? Yes, there has been no mention of screening any pair by higher time frame or any other method so that will be interesting to hear back. Other than that, I'm guessing if it looks good for take-off on the 4-H, you have to go with it. Yes, definitely, agreed. And I think 10ths would be about right, after that many add-ons, it would either be going the correct direction or ..... abort the take-off !!! Another agree on this point - in fact, it would be the only time in the history of trading that traders will be glad to see a few trades going the wrong way in order that they can get another entry. When you think about it, it really is a simple way to define a pull back, with an easily identifiable price point, as opposed to say a system that merely mentions short when price is back to the xxEMA or whatever. Sit back and enjoy the flight!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
People. I have been a member of this forum for many years and have witnessed good and sincerely informative threads like this die and end up in the corner collecting cobwebs. Why? Because too many users start nitpicking and pointing out the mistakes (we all make them) of the threads originator. Everyone has to keep in mind that information is shared with no compensation. When people make life difficult the "REAL" traders cut off the distractions, stop posting and return to what they love and are good at - TRADING. If you find a flaw or an error - sure, point it out... but if you want to prove how smart you are by hammering home that this is not EXACTLY as you said it would be (even though trading is in itself a grey area), you are just going to chase those with knowledge away. Trust me, I've seen it happen to many times on FF. Go back to the first post and please, lets remember to be courteous and respectful to each other.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I was trying to figure out a way to say exactly the above. enochben, you stated it far better than I could have. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
this is a scaling in trend following system with excellent money management practices. Think it would work well on a higher time frame like h4, where there is an already established strong trend on a higher time frame ie daily, weekly. You could measure the strength of the trend in the higher time frame using adm. Also with the entry point increments maybe every time the 5 ema touches the 30 ema etc. Someone should code this up for us for testing, think it would make lots of money with a few little modifications for automation.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I do agree what thread starter do but I believe not everyone could profit as he does. Trading always is not about system, strategies or whatsoever. It is all about risk, money management, patience and discipline.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
What happens when the setups fail? If there are many positions, All will end up a big loss... Still no clue what SL, TP he uses. He claims RR is 1:100ish or more???? What is the Hitrate? iF it is 10%, Then we are just playing casino here.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi Erebus, how do you call that MA indi and the one showing all the parameters in the left hand top corner, so I can look them up?

--- 帖子 #114 ---
M The MA are just that normal Metatrader MA, 1 x 34 EMA and 1 x 34 SMMA The corner indicator you refer to, you can find here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=540706 #2 Access Panel - This indicator gives you access to a number of charting features, including a Clock, special Bid and Ask lines, the display of Levels, "Natural" Fibos, time zone adjustable Pivots, Range H/L marks for the day and week, special vertical day Separators and vLines that mark the start-end of important markets during the day. Take note that some of the features mentioned here you will find turned "Off" on the sample templates. You will have to use the External Inputs provided to turn them "On. This indicator has many External Inputs for customizing. Daylight Savings Time considerations are fully automatic. A proper chart display is not dependent on live data feed. However, this indicator has a critical setup procedure users must follow, so read the User Notes ! And don't expect any support from me.....

Yes. There is no way we could replicate his results. First of all, the system is not yet properly outlined No Entry strategy No Exit strategy No SL &amp; TP No Rules We need to wait him to explain these stuff before we can evaluate

--- 帖子 #120 ---
For what I can read since his 1st post, what he is doing was absolutely write for retail traders. We will always back to the basic. I love he compare by using pilot with trading. Pilot is always technical-wise just as trader and weather are the fundamental. I do agree what you said. But with my experience, there are no magic numbers for Moving Averages no matter what the value are. Doesn't believe that, just put any value on any type of MAs, you will see a bounce there. Why? Because people only see what they wanted to see on the chart. They prefer not to accept the matter of fact when the price is totally ranging up and down crossing the MAs. But it doesn't mean thread starter does not profit. Trader must learn how to create their own strategy that allow them feel comfortable when trading. Believe me, it is much more easier to create one rather than to learn some other people strategy.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
If you read post #54 carefully, then you'll see that he already explained the initial entry, add-ons, exit and hence TP. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Sorry if this seems stupid, i am newbie here, Why my candles are different from yours guys? Is it my broker? because it use GMT Time. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Another thing, this is a 34 Simple Moving Average applied to close, not Smoothed like mentioned.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
There are a total of 4 different 4 hour candles depending on your broker. Some 4 Hour candles begin at GMT, some at GMT+1, some at GMT+2, and some at GMT+3. The concept will work no matter which 4 hour candle you have. It just means you will get some slightly different signals than other people might get at times. GREEN pips to you my friend.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I like it Abokwaik Nice simple EA perhaps to manage the re-entries. Thumbs up. Dreamliner, really enjoying this thread. Excellent analogy and explanations. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Thank you. I will make it ready, and share if thread OP is OK with that.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
We can fine tune it like adding a money management procedure to evenly distribute a fixed percentage of trading account (say 2% across max. 10 entries ) ,set break Even levels for re-entries, adm to avoid ranging markets, re-entry using faster ma,Resistance points, pivot levels,fibs, fractal reversals etc no disrespect intended just possible enhancements for automation .

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hello Dreamliner, I have taken this position below is it correct? there was some confusion on whether to use SMA or Smoothed MA 34. Thanks for your comments in advance. PS really like the comparison with flying and reaching the forex destination as smoothly as possible

Hi Dreamliner, Thank you for sharing this idea. The approach is interesting, as seen in abokwaik's pilot, it also may be sound. @ abokwaik: Do you mind sharing your code? I would like to try to further develop on that. Thanks a lot in advance!! Best

Greetings all, now home from my long flight, and will post more of my method. Everybody always wants to know about ranging markets, how to handle the whipsaws, etc. This is good and right, for we are simply trying to minimize losses. Every business should do this. I have spent the last 10 years studying ways to minimize whipsaw. I’ve read practically every thread on Forex Factory and have studied with mentors outside of Forex Factory, always seeking the illusive answer to minimizing losses during flat markets. I made it my goal to figure out how to do this. What I have discovered in my search is that I had been asking the wrong question. Instead of asking “how can I minimize losses in a ranging market”, instead of looking at a flat SMA and saying “wow, that sure would have produced some losses”, I have learned to change my thinking and questioning. Here is how I have changed my thinking. Now I ask, “How can I be profitable in trading?” Now, instead of looking at ranging markets around a flat SMA I look at the trends before and after, and ask, “Could I have traded that entire period profitably? Would trading this have made me money?” Now that’s not to say that we should stop looking for a method that would minimize drawdown during flat-lining markets. We should always be trying to improve, to find ways to reduce cost, to make our business more efficient. But what I am trying to get us to do on this thread is to look at the big picture. To view our trading from 40,000 feet. To zoom out and see the entirety of our trading method, and ask ourselves a simple question: “will I make money trading this way?” And so the one key thing to embrace in trading (which includes both our rule number 1 and rule number 2) is this: Keep our losses linear while making our profits exponential. Take numerous single losses around that flat SMA, but when the trend materializes then pile on the orders hand over fist, using multiple reentry methods if you’d like. I’ve shared my reentry method, which simply amounts to buying low and selling high (in comparison to where the market just was), others have shared some of their methods. I like my method, it allows me to pile on orders and ride a very strong tailwind. Again, keeping the big picture, the actual method for reentering is not as important as the fact that we are committed to multiplying profits in a trend. If compounding interest is the 8th wonder of the world, compounding profits in a trend is the most important thing in a trading method. These compounding profits will more than make up for singular losses around a flat SMA. So yes, continue looking for ways to minimize losses in ranging markets. But don’t let them discourage you, or you’ll not ever make a good trader. Rather than being discouraged by them, rise above the chop and see things from a higher view. Is it sound trading to take linear losses and exponential profits? Am I making money when I sit through 40 periods of chop followed by one trending period? These are the questions to ask. Relating this to the business of flying, we must learn to think like a CEO not an employee (absolutely nothing wrong with being an employee, I’m just using an illustration). A CEO does not look at times where flights are delayed, which cost the company money, and think “wow, these delays will ruin our yearly profits.” Or “oh my, these winter months are losing us money every single month, I don’t think it’s worth it to run this airline.” No, a CEO sees a bigger picture. He looks at the operation from 40,000 feet and sees that Spring, Summer and Fall months bring in much more profit than a few losses in the Winter. Granted, he is always looking for ways to minimize losses; implementing cost saving programs when and where he can. But he accepts small losses in exchange for large profits as a normal part of business life. We must do the same in our trading. We could look at flat line SMA times all day long, and all of us agree they would be times of losses. This might lead us to decide that, for my type of personality, I would rather be a range trader, since ranges happen the majority of the time. That’s perfectly fine, and a good decision for many. Or, we might decide to accept small losses, helping our range trading brothers and sisters make a living too, and stay with our trend trading methodology. After 10 years in this industry, reading everything I could find on the subject, testing many different methods and concepts, I’m convinced that range-losses are here to stay, and that trend-gains will overcome them , by a value of multiples. Having said that, let’s look at some times when whip-saw is the norm, and losses start to pile up. In the following picture we go through a 40 period range-loss. That’s 40 period-times (in this case 4 hour) where we get one delay after another, where we wonder if this plane is ever going to get in the air. And I do know that there are times when ranges are much longer…the flight gets canceled and we try again the next day! Here is the first picture. Study this chart!

Use Oanda . You can add positions, and place stop losses on those new positions and the stop losses stay tied with their orders, not with the first position. Or you can do like I do and close them manually.

Hi Dreamliner, i'll leave this here - Abokwaik has posted this before in one of his threads, but it's worth a reminder: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...15#post8123915 A robot Adopter should find HIS best robot(s) with best settings that suites his favorite instruments, time frames, and risk tolerance, and do his homework of back and forward testing before applying to a real account. Don't think robots will make you money while you're sleeping. They require proper management, tweaking every now and then ... They are Tools. Just like a paint brush, it does not make an art piece, its the Painter who does. I am a free tool provider, you must be a good painter to make a living from trading the market. Thanks to both Dreamliner and Abokwaik for dedicating their time to this forum.

I didn't ask either the size of your trading account or your position size, only if : (a) you traded that chart as shown and in your Live trading account ? &amp; (b) in meaningful size (without asking what that size might be in $ terms) ? Pretty simple, relevant questions, don't you think ? Why so ? Because there are endless threads here at FF in which people show wonderful charts and winning trades, whilst never having had a profitable year trading. Some of these people can really "Talk the Talk", but trading for them is a hobby, not a serious financial activity. Such threads are very misleading for those who aspire to learn to trade well. I doubt very much that you traded the chart as shown... good luck with your thread, whatever its purpose. .

I understand. I only trade live. I don't like to demo trade. And yet with Oanda you can trade with literally 1 unit. That's so tiny that nothing can go wrong . I traded that chart live, as shown.

Welcome back

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Dreamliner, Thank you for sharing your experience. First of all, this method reminds me to some extent to the Millipede thread. Your trades are "over" in a much shorter period of time, but there are similarities. I have a few questions. 1- You say you put your initial SL at the most recent swing high/low (high or low). Fine. But this most recent swing must surely be on the other side of the 34 SMA. I understood that if price goes against you and closed on the "wrong" side of 34 SMA, then you close all open positions and open a new one on the other side. So if you were long, you now are short and vice versa . So the question is: if price close on the wrong side of 34SMA, but does not reach your SL, do you close the position manually and reverse your position? 2- You say the risk is only the initial postion and all the add-ons are risk-free. Maybe I did not read it properly, but there is no such a thing a "risk-free" position. You seem to assume that all the add-ons will be in profit at some stage and you will put a SL at BE. Some add-ons will NEVER be in profit and if you have a SL quite a bit further, these SL will be hit at some point and the risk becomes greater. For instance, say SMA is at 50. You open a long position at 51. A rocket takes off to 60 on the first candle. Great! But the next closes at 59. Addon. Next closes at 58. Addon and so on. None of these addons ever go in profit. You see what I am getting at. Of course, this is a nightmare scenario. 3- Will you trade different pairs that are highly correlated? Or taking contrary positions on two different pairs that have a high negative correlation. You could be overexposed if you do so. 4- If you always trade a particular pair, then you should almost always be in the market. Right? Whenever price goes through 34 SMA, you close all open positions and take anew one on the opposite side, right? Thank you, Insider

Heya Dreamliner, welcome back. I've entered the EURUSD with a micro lot for testing purposes, this pair has been in a 200-300 pip range since beginning of December and is certainly due a good trend move . Lets see how it goes.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also, I noticed other colleagues are testing with other timeframes such as the day range, my question is the 34 SMA you have found works best for 4H TF or can the same MA be applied to other TF's with the same result or do we still need to test these, just trying to save some time here.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
insider999, I don't know much, but I assume that you only keep adding to your position on pullbacks or if the trend remains strong... You don't fly against a jetstream if you're low on fuel, same here, you wont be adding to your position if the trend is losing its 'force'. And by risk free, he means that you set your stop loss on the 0pips loss, after a few positive ones. If you are unfortunate enough to buy right before a pullback, I guess there you might lose the pullback's equal. That's why you should use other indicators to inform you when the trend is losing its momentum.

Another point that needs to be made; What Dreamliner has presented is not necessarily a trading strategy that is a "one size fits all" mentality. He has explained his entries and stops - but the biggest takeaway is the money management and psychology. Range - could last 2-3 months, take all the small losses. Trend - could only last 1 month, but due to adding ( many ) positions, this could easily cover 3-4 months of losses from the ranging this type of management could be applied to "any" trend trading system with success; the ideas are quite endless. You don't necessarily have to use 4Hr with 34SMA... you could even use ADX on daily if it will give you a better long term Trend signal the key is simply to add positions and hope for a long (and boring) flight

--- 帖子 #169 ---
all in the blue box were small losses depending on stop. I assume

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Excellent and very well said. Let's just replace all my drivel with your paragraph above!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Yes, you are absolutely right. The thing is I was not available to trade those at the time, so didn't include them. Wish I was, for the trade would have of course been more profitable. But yes, you are correct, those candles would have actually been the start of the downtrend.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Very good. Watch that previous high up there to the left; if the market gets close carefully consider what you want to do. It's always good to consult support and resistance. We're traders, not robots.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Dreamliner, If you get a chance, I would like your opinion on the legitimate questions I asked and observations I made. Thank you, Insider

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi mate, thanks for agreeing and I believe that you are sharing your own strategy with good intention. Unfortunately usually what I found in forum, lots of them will not feel grateful or appreciate. They will even blame you when they loss the trade. It is not because neither you nor the strategy problem, just because they doesn't fully understand how it works. Just like forex, I believe 10 out of 10 here know how to trade forex. I can trade forex by only learning 10 minutes because it is only either buy or sell. But does that means I am fully understand how to trade profitable? Does I really understand such as price behavioral, fundamental, etc? For a professional trader, they will always back to the basic just as pilot does, altitude, speed, autopilot. But does that means enough? Nope. Either professional trader or pilot knows how and when to handle any circumstances but an amateur only know how to trade.

This is the test on CADJPY Daily from Nov 27, 2015 until today Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Apparently the system will suffer on trend change. I have already highlighted this issue in post # 59 .

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Dreamliner, Thanks for sharing your trading idea. I do using the same method like yours. A fx trader should be able to have a method to identify high probabilty (to minimize wrong signal) and high RR. And take action consistently. Plus willing to have a small 'cost'. Good luck, Note: it doesn't matter SMA 34 or other. The most important thing is to know your indi behaviour.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
No MCFly, you are not wrong. My test as stated in the post was "Same test on Daily ", so I took the same period I used for H4 in the test prior to that. Assuming you started using the system on 1/1/2016 on Daily. Please check my reply to BillYon, Post 176. SL was not moved to BE.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Sorry, but an EA show the real performance of the system. nothing more or less. It's easy to say you can earn thousand of pips when a trend starts, but nobody knows when a trend will start and when the ranging market begins. So why do you not want to talk about an EA in your thread? I know...

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Very nice thread dreamliner! I like the analogy very much, trading can be compared to al lot off things in live, if not all. I too noticed a small comparison with the Millipede thread, but this one has much more defined exits and add-on trades, so it should be more easy to work with. Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I agree on EAs not working long term, same goes for mechanical manual trading, due of course to the dynamical nature of markets . In fact I prefer EAs on manual trading for mechanical systems, as EAs are emotionless and stick to the rules. Discretionary trading of course is completely another story. I respect your view, and I will not post any. ---------------- On the other hand, The general concept of the method you shared is well known. It is one of the best methods to make money from trading. Most of the system I shared on FF are based on this concept. What I don't like in your application of the method is mainly the re-entry on every opposite candle, which can eat-up most if not all of the profits at trend change. I'd noted that in post # 59, in case you missed it : As for re-entries on opposite candles, its a bit dangerous. Here are other options I prefer: Re-entry on a touch of a faster MA (say 5MA) Re-entry on a Fractal Break in the trend direction Note about re-entries : They should never be at a price better than our last entry. Example : If we are in an up-trend, our next buy should never be at a price lower that our last re-entry. This is all I have to say in this thread. Again thank you DreamLiner for sharing your method. And wish you all a safe flight home.

Abokwaik, not to say anything to derail the thread, but what you mentioned - didn't you already create that as part of the Robot lab project? (like the very first robot in that thread?)

--- 帖子 #182 ---
they just want to live the dream a bit more longer until they see truth manually.robots are not precised on some ocasions but also robots hint about system

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Dear, In my opinion, This technique will not be profitable on Higher TF more than H1. Because a bearish or bullish close of daily candle means too much rather than the bullish or bearish close of H1. This becomes important because this technique suggest to make a re-entry on trade opposite candle. When daily candle closes bullish or bearish , its more likely that the next day candle will follow the previous day candle(depending on other factors). Its my understanding, that the higher you go with this technique, the higher will be DD.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Yeah, that's what I meant. You did not move SL to BE, on the contrary of what Dreamliner does, and that's what maybe let him make good money by re-entering at every pullback candle without eating most of the earnings.

Hi Dreamliner...Following your thread with interest (fellow pilot here) One point I am not 100% clear on is 'when to close or exit' the initial trade? A previous poster implies it is when the 34 SMA is crossed in the opposite direction. IS this correct? GG

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Dear Mr Clive, could you please share your moving average indicator that change colour red to green. With appreciation, Davide

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Correct. Not only the initial trade, all add-ons, too. The idea is to ride the trend with multiple positions as long as price is above/below 34 SMA. When it is crossed and candle closes in opposite direction, then close all positions and open a new position in opposite direction assuming the trend is changing. Hope this helps. Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Perfect - thanks

--- 帖子 #195 ---
That way you are protecting yourself against the risk of changing trends, right?

It is a difference between piloting a 787 dreamliner plane and trading fx. If the dispatcher can't find a jetstream of wind, how would you still pilot the flying? If no long or last trend would be unfold for a while, how would you keep trading, pile up more trades?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Sometimes I read comments here on FF that I really don't understand. According to what you are saying there are only 2 possibilities. Or Dreamliner is lying or you are wrong.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I trade Clive's "Trading is as simple as ABCD" method, he has a thread in FF. He uses two colored indicators, links below, one has an alert pop up box with sound alert and can be turned to false if not required. I think the one on chart shown in this thread is set at 35, can be set to anything you want. Good Luck. MA_Slope Alerts.ex4 MA_In_Color.ex4

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Dear, Its my opinion and also abowaik strategy results showing the same. Dreamliner has much more experience of it. So I may be wrong. Please try to select better words while expressing your opinion.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
UNFORTUNATELY abowaik UNSUBSCRIB THIS THRED

--- 帖子 #202 ---
The results are not in line with the rules outlined. As Abowaik said, the SLs of the addons were not moved to BE, if they were the results would have been totally different. You're free to post your opinion, but the implications are still there, maybe I'm not the only one who should select different words.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
what most people fail to understand is that the main problem is not the System but the Trader. one can give a good system to a bad trader, and that trader will still lose on the long run. a good trader may use a poor system and still make money - by using proper management. an EA robot could be a great tool -again in the hands of a good trader. Maybe Abowaik can write such an EA for this system(in another thread) which computes the Break Even retraction price. let's say you are in a trend, and you expect prices to go from A to C, but you are some intermediate point B, and with some good profit. How do you protect that profit in case price starts to retrace back towards A ? do you keep the initial SL or move it closer to B (maybe using a lower value MA for SL?) how much more would you gain if price just continues to move from B to C ? is it worth to give up entire profit you have at point B hoping price will reverse and go to C?

In the positon of the threadstarter, i would never again post here. He has described the strategy and thats it. Simple but true and a really good story. Nothing more to say. The rest is evolution. Now i am picking his posts and trying to translate it in german with all the pictures from him. Eventually with pictures from planes and rockets. Many thanks dreamliner, never had read about a strategie in such an originally way. Michael

--- 帖子 #207 ---
The Ea written can't be used to validate the system as it doesn't replicate the business rules for starters.. Like I mentioned before it needs a money management procedure for starters , the most important ComponentRead the the thread properly. If you are going to write an ea. Program it properly don't waist our time

--- 帖子 #208 ---
100% agree. Thread starter done his job and now its you and me, to tailor it to suit one's needs.

Hi Dreamliner, and flight passengers. I'm rather new to Forex but I'm working my hardest. Everyone started at some point, and I'm very excited to continue my education. I just found your thread a few minutes ago. I haven't read it all yet, but I'm starting now. Thanks for your time and effort, I'm sure your experience will be of great value to me. I look forward to adding to this discussion. Happy Trading!!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Did you read the thread properly ? I don't think so. The EA was built according to the system rules, outlined in post # 39 and post # 54 System Rules : Entry : I use a 34 SMA (smooth moving average) cross as my entry point. On my initial entry I usually do not move the stop loss. It stays above the previous swing high or low. Re-Entry: I add on to my trade whenever there is a candle that closes opposite to the trend. Exit : ​My subsequent entries, however, have no initial stop loss and will be closed upon either of two conditions being met: ​First, if the market closes above the SMA I will close this trade. Second, I wait for the market to move in my favor a small amount and then place a stop loss at breakeven plus cost (spread). If you examine any trend you might question why we place a stop loss on these add-on trades at all. After all, adding on these trades clearly would bring in profits in a real trend, taking advantage of huge Jetstream tailwinds on our flight. Indeed, you may choose not to set a break even on these at all. Backtest it, study it, decide if you want to use this method or let them run, or maybe come up with another method that is different. The reason I set the break evens on these add on trades is because of rule number one: keep losses small. Sometimes, when the trend gets extended price will come back to the SMA, and all those trades coming back to the SMA will be losers. The reason to not set break evens on these add on trades is because of rule number two: let winners runand multiply them. In a good trend these add on trades will produce hundreds and thousands of pips, literally compounding your profits on the way to your destination. So which method should we use? The answer is up to you. ( Post # 55 ) In this case we did not use the break evens on the add-on trades. Had we added those break evens we would have lost less and won less. Overall it probably would have been less profitable in this case to use the break evens. Sometimes it will be better, in saving some losses; other times a little worse in giving up some profits. Its up to you. The EA test I ran was mainly to simulate the example trade DreamLiner posted, so I made it according to the options he chose. I am sorry if I wasted anybody's time. Clearly I wasted my time.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi abokwaik, Please do not be discouraged by comments of members who do not understand benefits of automation of trading. I appreciate your work and complement for the hard work you did for developing EA. In the experience of trading 15 years I had lot a lot due to drawback of manual trading which had never gained much. If rules are clear and disciplined then EA definitely work as per rule and eliminate Greed and Fear in trading which is main weakness of human. I practiced 34SMA method for entry and exit in past and had huge loss due to uncertainty of market behavior when all of sudden it takes turn to be trendy in opposite direction. Once I added additional positions for DAX and due to fundamental it took 180 degree turn and I lost huge money since then I stopped relying on 34SMA, it may be my Greed and Fear. I am again trying to use 34SMA but still not sure whether it could be profitable. Dreamliner seems to be a super human to identify exact entries and exit due to his trading merit.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Good thread Dreamliner! Trend trading is the way to go! What is frustrating is finding a solid trend and it is clear in the postings here. Without trying to interfere or changing Dreamliners method i would like to add/suggest the following: The aim of trend traders is to get into strong trends with as little as possible dragged out consolidation periods which will result into multiple entries and stop outs. Solution: Open your daily and weekly charts. Draw Support and Resistance Levels Place pending orders on these levels Alarms can be set to alert you when these levels are approacehed Trade these VERY powerful bounces for 300 to 1000 pips depending on the currency you have chosen Most currencies gives you at least a 400 pip run on these bounces. ( FEZMAR described these 400 pips runs as ideal in his thread and he takes profit or locks in profit after 400 pips.) By trading these bounces you are filtering out "flat markets" and your edge becomes much more favourable. Adding on these runs along the way will make you smile all the way. These runs from weekly and monthly bounces does not last for ages . Check it out and see for yourself how powerfull they are....... I have 19 pairs on my "watchlist" and although "bounces" are not an everyday occurance it gives me enough "trend trades" Hope this helps. Happy Trading. Respect to Dreamliner.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
A way to filter out the flat markets could be to use charts not based on time (range, renko, pnf with large enough brick size, linebreak). k

Dreamliner, can you tell us about your Money Management. I just now have started and will give it a try in my live account with GBPAUD. Could be the beginning of a huge uptrend.

Yes fuel is needed for the rocket. My rocket has start and now is on the flight. After landing and looking for the next travel, i have make some notes. In the first phase i will have max. trades for all the delay. I have a security exit aswell. I plan only to fire 20% from previous win in the starting phase. So calculate my starting-trades against the security-exit. That means are not the same lot. 10% are taken for the maintance-crew if hedging is needed. After the take off is done, i quickly make throttle up with another 20%. So i have 50% on the flight. Another trick if comfortable with it. First trade 1- 2% say i have won 20%, next i set it all back in the new travel 20% and if all gets okay, yeah massive results happen. If the plain are broken i start again with 1-2%. Max. 2 in a row. 1% taken - 15 % won 15% taken - 60 % won now back to 1% because two in a row 1% taken - 1% loss back to 1% because loss 1 % taken - 20% won 20 % taken - 40 % won back to 1% because two in a row ... and so on ... Make a calculation yourself. Have a nice flight. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entry at M15 Greets Michael

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1454230520 Has anyone bothered to do the math yet? If not you are kidding yourself. This run up netted 1050 pips for a 375 pip move. Since the OP must have split his capital in 20 to ride this move the 1050 equals 52 pips if all in. That's just 5 pips a day for an average trend move! Since there will be more ranging days than big move days you should expect to make less on average than 5 pips a day! The problem here is adding on positions well into the trend. If he had gone all in at the start he would have netted 375 pips or 37 per day. You need to front end load your trades if you split them, maybe wait for a pull back and a bullish candle or enter the second and third at 30 and 60 pips profit. Sorry to be a Debby Downer but the numbers don't lie.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
The difficulty with your method is that it will break rule # 1....Keep Losses Small, unless you pick the exact right candle to initiate your trend trade with and if you can do that consistently, you definitely don't need this system. GREEN pips to you.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Subscibed... I hope I will learn more from you guys!!

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Betting the whole position on the first trade will lead to huge losses as the system doesn't know if this will be the start of a good trend or just a false signal. You can do that with other precise entry systems with minimum stop loss, as in this thread : Very small stops by tunera Splitting the position into smaller amounts, and risking only a small portion on the first trade is favored for this system, until the trend proves it self, then add on retraces. As I mentioned in an earlier post, this is one of the best ways to make money in forex. This is a recent thread utilizing a similar method, although it has premature exits IMO. 2MAs, 1 RSI by Sis.yphus

Hmmm, this might cheer you up - I have attempted backtest manually on GU daily chart since that is the timeframe Dreamliner mainly aluded entries to catch the trend, few whipsaw trades then finally caught the trend, tripled the account profit in 2 months.

Hi Alamhakim, If you have shorted below your trend indicating moving average it is alright. Additional confirmations are shorting is in line with the trend (down Trend), Price Action is a very good engulfing pattern and last three candles forms abc formation downwards. If you have shorted you should be in profit unless there was something drastic happened in the market. I hope this will help.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thanks for that, hope can get boring flight with no drama.

NOW EVERY ONE HAVE A PLANE. GREETINGS CAPTAINS

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi Alamhakim, No offense but regarding your backtest of G/U daily that is a huge trend of 1100 pips in a month. You should still be in the trade as per the rules and 5 of the 8 trades are underwater. Like I said before the problem is you keep adding when the trend is finished. Seriously if it doesn't make money in a trend when will it?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Aren't you supposed to not add-on at the same price or higher??

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I think would be out of trade end of today as crossing back ma. Still in large profit? Show me as I may be misunderstanding otherwise.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Excellent point, we need some clarification from Dreamliner?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I knew I had seen it somewhere. Read through the whole thread and it wasn't Dreamliner that said that - it was Abokwaik - post 181. Nevertheless I think it's a good rule. Wait till the trend gets going before you re-enter.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
To make life a little easier for everyone interested in Dreamliner's HFT Method, I have put his explanation, so far, into a pdf, so that it is easy to read. Remember that the 34 SMA that everyone is fixated on is merely a suggestion by Dreamliner. He clearly states that whatever method you find comfortable with that determines a trend is what you should use. If you don't like the 34 SMA, you are free to try something else. Find what is comfortable for you and your style of trading. I personally use a different trend finding method, and it works just fine for me. Also remember that there will be losses. In fact there will probably be many times more losses than winners, but rule # 1 "Keep the loses small" is so important. Call it the cost of doing business. Now the winners will be less frequent, but rule # 2 "Let your profits grow and multiply" will ensure that they should be magnitudes of 10, 20, 50, or even 100 times bigger than the losses. This is the income for your business. Just like the major airlines do not fly just ONE kind of plane (except for SouthWest), you should not pick just one pair to trade. If you knew for certain exactly which pair was going to trend and when, you would be a billionaire by now. Since you are not a billionaire, pick multiple pairs to follow and trade. We don't know for certain which pair is starting a trend. Remember the losses will be small, but the profits will be large. Then there are those that either hate to fly or are afraid to fly. No one is forcing you to fly. Yes planes crash and people die, but statistically it is very safe. Don't call those that choose to fly crazy or dumb for getting on the plane. It's our choice, right or wrong. This goes back to one of Dreamliner's first rules for the thread...RESPECT those that participate in the discussion. GREEN pips to one and all, and may your flight take you and your family to exactly where you want to go. Attached File(s) Dreamliner HFT Method.pdf 709 KB | 3,558 downloads

Nice thread..simple and straight forward. Many will come up with some filters so they won't get whipsawed or need to enter every candle in the opposite direction of the trend. I know I have a few ideas already but won't say much on the subject until I can test them out. All in all a good starting point for a longer time frame method.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi AbokWaik, What you say is correct, but only half of the story. In the same way that the system does not know when a good trend is developing and it is preferable (if possible) not to put all your eggs in the same basket, it does not know when a developed trend is reversing and all your eggs are in the same basket.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I agree. I already have ways to handle stacked positions near trend end, but I don't want to deviate much from dreamliner's method. Its his thread after all.

You can decide the parametes of the ma and the alert in the setting. Anyway the ma of this indicator is not showed in the chart, but it is there and the alert works.

Hi all, I've been focusing this idea, especially MA powers for some time. I think EMA10 + EMA20 look promising. That'd be a real shortcut, if someone could back test on majors. I just thought it's impossible to back test, because we will decide which MA will fit on our chart. ( Please take a look at image and you'll get what I mean) Please correct me if I'm wrong about back test. (I hope I am Rule is almost the same as Dreamliner described, except EMA10 + EMA20 combo. I'd appreciate all you guys comments on this. Cheers, morican

Yes, without any maintance cost this is more than dificult and must entered in calculation. I have made today 13% in one week to my demo acount.

[quote=Dreamliner;8724868]Greetings all, now home from my long flight, and will post more of my method. Everybody always wants to know about ranging markets, how to handle the whipsaws, etc. This is good and right, for we are simply trying to minimize losses. Every business should do this. I have spent the last 10 years studying ways to minimize whipsaw. Ive read practically every thread on Forex Factory and have studied with mentors outside of Forex Factory, always seeking the illusive answer to minimizing losses during flat markets. I made it my goal to figure out how to do this . DELAYS BEFORE TAKE-OFF Hello Dreamliner/Traders: I have been glued to this flight since its inception; Love it; have checked out every seat; love them; enjoyed all the comments and contributions. "...I made it my goal to figure out how to do this...", Dreamliner. Been thinking of a method to minimize (not to eliminate) the whipsaws as well during the periods of maintenance delays, baggage loading delays, weather delays, Crew delays and Air Traffic Control delays. Specific reference is made to Dreamliners chart below:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pair: CADJPY Timeframe: H4 Time Interval: From 2015.11.25 12:00 to 2015.12.07 04:00 Not sure how many of us here are familiar with the Ichimoku Cloud Indicator but I thought it might make an excellent fit to Dreamliners HFT Method, since it is Cloud Based. I would like our MT4 Programmers here to take a shot at Coding this system and back-testing it using the same parameters from the Pre-Take-Off Delays above. And then, of course, to test the system for the entire trade, and others. SYSTEM RULES Preamble to note: This is not a new system; it is simply an investigation into a methodology for eliminating the pre-flight delays in Dreamliner's Method. Also, this will not get us into the Trade at the very start of the Trend owing to the rules (price action must be below cloud for short trades for example) but let's start here and with the dialogue, input and critique here we may just end up with a good filter. Indicators Ichimoku Cloud Bill Williams Fractals 34SMA Timeframe H4 H4 Step 1 Candle breaks and closes below 34SMA. If yes go to Step 2 Step 2 Full body Bearish Candle forms with open and close prices below 34SMA. If yes go to Step 3 (Bullush Candle for Long Setups) Step 3 Tanken Sen is below Kijun Sen; minimum cross to be 2 pips. If yes go to Step 4. Step 4 34SMA is below Cloud. If yes go to Step 5 Step 5 Is Price below Cloud. If yes go to Step 6 Note: If no for any of the above Steps then go back to Step 1 Step 6 - Entry Open Short position at open of the next candle (92.003) Stop Loss at most recent (previous) Fractal High (92.377) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Chart showing Operational Delays between December 25, 2015 to December 7, 2015 and all Candles breaking and closing below the 34SMA (C1C7), to be tested for false clearance . Note small ticks in Figure above showing where there are full candle bodies with open and close below the 34SMA following the signal candle (candles C1, C3, C4, C6 and C7). I have also used an x to show where this is not the case, as in Candles C2, C5 In Figure below, I have shown the indicators being used as Filter; the Ichimoku Cloud with default settings and the Bill Williams Fractals. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ichimoku Cloud and Fractals added as Filter Step 7, Etc Remaining Steps for adding to initial position and other Money Management procedures per Dreamliners Method. Further Comments: Lets examine all the candles breaking and closing below the 34SMA, providing a potential Trade Setup:- C1: Breaks 34SMA, followed by a full body bearish candle with open and close below the 34SMA but Tanken Sen is above Kijun Sen so signal ignored; C2: Breaks 34SMA but next candle closes above 34SMA so signal ignored; C3: Breaks 34SMA, followed by a full body bearish candle with open and close below the 34SMA but Tanken Sen is above Kijun Sen so signal ignored; C4: Breaks 34SMA, followed by a full body bearish candle with open and close below the 34SMA but Tanken Sen is not below Kijun Sen so signal ignored; C5: Breaks 34SMA but the next candle closed above 34SMA hence signal ignored; C6: Breaks 34SMA, followed by full body bearish candle with open and close below 34SMA but 34SMA is in the Cloud so signal ignored C7: Breaks 34SMA, followed by full body bearish candle with open and close below the 34SMA. Tanken Sen is below Kijun Sen and the 34SMA is below the Cloud. Signal Valid!. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As it has turned out, all the signals, except the entry as traded by Dreamliner have been invalidated by this System as False Clearances for Take-Off, resulting in the following Entry:- Short at 92.003 (almost exactly at the same candle as Dreamliner) Stop Loss at 92.377 (previous fractal) Aye aye Captain! Over to you MT4 Programmers!.

A really practical and nice thread dear dreamliner, The things which you are explaining are the virtue of your solid trading experience and technical analysis. No doubt the dozen indicators and a long list of rules cannot improve the trading rather than to run through the simple and solid approach which you are explaining. I really appreciate your sharing on this forum and hope so you will further contribute and put your worthwhile experience with us. Hoping your next post coming soon.....anxious...

HI guys Stick to the rules and eat the losses. Don't try and overthink this.

Hi! What money management are you using? What is initial risk for the first trade and how do you calculate the size of next orders? Dou you use a stop loss for added trades? With regards, SP

great. is that figure your open p/l at the moment? what timeframe are you using h4 or daily?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Great to see your success. A heartfelt "THANK YOU" to Dreamliner for sharing his system and insights as a full fledged Captain of "GREEN PIPS" airline. I have also been trading it live since last Monday. I have been testing both the H4 time frame and the D1 time frame. I use a different trigger than the 34 SMA, but it is still a very simple trigger without any filters. To be honest, I have accidentally closed all the positions twice and started over anew after each time I closed the positions. So far the D1 has been the most profitable, but one week does not a system make. Overall it has shown a good closed profit and a nice floating profit. At this time, all of my current open trades are free, SL at BE +2 pips. As for initial SL I use the last swing high or low as the location for the initial SL for my initial primary trades. For any add on secondary trades, I also use the previous swing high/low as the initial SL. Once the market has moved in my favor 20 or 30 pips, I move my SL to BE +2 on my secondary trades. For the primary trades, I let the market move significantly in my favor, 100 to 200 pips, before I move my SL to BE +2. This reduces my market risk so that I am not continuing to add risk upon risk with every new day, and new trade. I am never worried that the market will come and touch my SL and then turn and take off on me. There will always be another day, another pair, and another trend flight to catch. If I have done my ground work correctly, most of the initial risk/cost will be reduced to a minimum which allows me to buy more tickets on more flights. We never know which flight is the one that will take us to the warmth of the South Pacific islands or the beauty of the Swiss Alps because the destination is never printed on the ticket when we first buy it. We just buy as many tickets as we can on as many different flights, knowing that some will be cancelled due to weather, some will be cancelled due to major system failure, some will be delayed due to maintenance, some will take-off and have to return to the airport for repairs, some will take-off and then land at an airport in a city or country we really didn't want to visit, and then there will be those that we are upgraded to first class and take us to our desired destination. But remember, to get there we had to buy our ticket. Without a ticket we will never get to where we truly want to be. Lets hear from more traders testing this system, live or demo. Any insights to help those that might be afraid to buy their own tickets will be well worth it. May everyone enjoy a safe flight on their own "GREEN PIPS" airlines.

Great comments SmoothTrader. Dreamliner is on to something big. I read something years ago, that has been bouncing around in my head, and Dreamliner has crystallized it for me. To me, if you break it down this trading method is this simple. " keep buying until price stops going up, and keep selling until price stops going down, you are only going to wrong once " Lets keep this thread going, especially for all the mechanical traders.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
This method does truly embrace the KISS (Keep It Simple) method, and sometimes simple is better. Hopefully, more will begin testing this method, and refining it to their own comfort levels and styles. Then in the spirit of Dreamliner they should share their results and findings. Just remember that Dreamliner gave us the fundamental truths (Thrust and Lift) and without them your plane will crash and burn. For our own comfort we add different paint, wider seats, taller cabin, better meals, etc in the form of filters, but that is secondary to the truths. It's like putting those different paints, wider seats, taller cabin, etc on the plane. It won't make it fly faster or higher, but it will look and feel better. Concentrate on the Truths and you will be safe. GREEN pips to one and all and I hope that everyone enjoys their flight on "GREEN PIPS" airline.

Just testing and got the Margin Call..

--- 帖子 #275 ---
A couple of questions come to mind. Why did you choose the 12 Hour time frame as opposed to a Daily or 4 Hour time frame? Your chart is a good example of the reason why some traders only add a secondary position if the price is below the last order taken (for sales) or above the last order taken (for buys). This would have eliminated all but 4 of the sales, and reduced your risk a great deal. Dreamliner advocates moving your SL on secondary trades to BE as soon as possible. All but the last of the 4 trades had ample opportunity to have their SL's moved to BE thus protecting your capital reserves. You said that you hit a Margin Call which indicates that your position sizing was way too aggressive. This is not a Moon Shot get rich quick method so conservative position sizing is called for. Keep picking out different periods to test and refine your rules, and see how the results come out. GREEN pips to you Good Sir.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi all I am using the daily chart only. Yes that was the current open P/L when posted. What I was thinking of implementing and have started today doing, is closing half the trade at 1000 points (100 pips). I have a stop on the first trade only at a safe level but haven't been placing stops on secondary trades. I think what I may do is if trend starts getting extended maybe setting BE to all trades. I have put a PSAR on the charts and am looking to see if it would work to stop placing trades or closing all trades if price starts hitting the dots. Then if the trend continues take more secondary trades. Chris

im amazed ! to be honest, i've been reading this thread silently from the beginning and i logged in just to THANK Dreamliner for such a GOOD THREAD ! i started to make an EA based on this method and this is the results so far Attached Image (click to enlarge) and yea .... once i finish the EA , i will share it here in this thread , so keep your eyes open ! &lt;3 Note : you don't have to worry about win/lose ratio. because we keep losses small , and let profits run + multiply them !

Call me crazy but, What do yo guys think about using the system to scalp the M1 charts?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Now you're talking my kinda language..... trends setup all day and every day on 1 minute charts so why not trade them the same way??? Especially markets like the Dow or the Dax which move 300 pips per day, they quite simply have to trend to move that far in one day... Tough thing to do though.....as with all trend trading, so many false starts to suffer before you catch one...

If I may suggest. For smaller TF, look for regular cyclic volatility pair like this one on 30 min and wait for values to increase (blue zones).

Clive, I feel happy that you quote my reply lol (you are like a mentor or something) , i have been with your ABCD system and DAX group for like 4 months now (cuz it works) but i think this system can generate more profit in shorter time so i am giving it my time now. Here is an example of a M1 Trade. 105 Pips in 20 minutes "Edit : (20 Pips Range) Attached Image (click to enlarge) - There is a problem, there are a lot wrong entries which cost a lot of pips also, the idea is if we will scalp we need Safe entries, any one has an idea share it please. - I didn't wait for the 34 SMA cross, some times those final entries under it make me lose - I tried 3 different Order Managers to close all the trades but all of them don't close all orders at once, it close one by one i hate that because it makes me lose pips, is there a solution for that or that is normal? - About safe entries , i used ADX to trade only if it's above 25, but made me miss the bigger trends. A LOT. - Thank you Dreamliner for the great idea.

Anyone have much success trading 5M or 15M using this strategy? If so, can anyone chime in on key points in terms of what price action criteria I should look for to make an entry? (Other than having price crossover 34 SSMA, of course!)

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I'll try to run through your points one at a time. There will always be bad entries that result in losses, but we want to keep those loses as small as possible. How were you placing your stops? What did you do when the candle closed on the opposite side of the MA? This is just one possible order entry trigger method, have you thought about others? I personally use something other than the SMA. Have you thought of only entering new orders if they are lower than the last entry (for sales) or above the last entry (for buys)? This would reduce some of your losses. Unfortunately there is no way to close all trades at once. EA's work through the closing process one trade at a time, so there will be some slippage. Sometimes it's positive and sometimes it's negative. When focusing on safer entries DON'T focus on the good trades you missed, focus on the bad trades it saved you from because that is its purpose. It is nearly impossible to find a system that will reduce the bad trades while giving you all the positive trades. GREEN pips to you Good Sir. Hopefully my questions and observations will help you to refine your trading method to something that is more comfortable for you.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Like!. Waiting.....

--- 帖子 #292 ---
ive 'half' tested this out the biggest issue is the false entries. EURNZD Attached Image (click to enlarge) another example. GBPAUD Attached Image (click to enlarge) - notice the sharp pull backs? - heavy ranging period - less possible re-entries - more noise.. Loads of small loss trades and short might create some issues.. There is a way to trade it on the 15M but some of the rules have to change to make it work... and then IMO it becomes a different system. JM2CW

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Here is what we all need to remember. I will start placing BE stops on secondary trades as the trend extends itself. But probably not on the firs several secondary trades. HER IS THE QUOTE FROM DREAMLINER; My subsequent entries, however, have no initial stop loss (if uncomfortable with this, you can always place a stop), and will be closed upon either of two conditions being met: First, if the market closes above the SMA I will close this trade. Second, I wait for the market to move in my favor a small amount (sometimes as little as 10 pips, depending on the market) and then place a stop loss at breakeven plus cost (spread). Since I start my trading day at 5:00 PM Pacific Time I do this manually as the market moves before I go to bed. But Im sure there are EAs that would assist you with this if needed. This means that these subsequent entries have no chance of taking the entire trade into a loss (remember, we have a position on at the beginning of the trend that is in profit), a medium chance of running with the trend clear to the end, and a larger chance of just breaking even. In other words, there is no risk to adding on positions like this, and a chance for a large reward. No risk, large reward trading is what we like. It is part and parcel of our High Flying Trading method. If you examine any trend you might question why we place a stop loss on these add-on trades at all. After all, adding on these trades clearly would bring in profits in a real trend, taking advantage of huge Jetstream tailwinds on our flight. Indeed, you may choose not to set a break even on these at all. Backtest it, study it, decide if you want to use this method or let them run, or maybe come up with another method that is different. The reason I set the break evens on these add on trades is because of rule number one: keep losses small. Sometimes, when the trend gets extended price will come back to the SMA, and all those trades coming back to the SMA will be losers. The reason to not set break evens on these add on trades is because of rule number two: let winners runand multiply them. In a good trend these add on trades will produce hundreds and thousands of pips, literally compounding your profits on the way to your destination. So which method should we use? The answer is up to you. I will sometimes not place the breakevens on the add ons near the beginning of the trend, and will place them on the add ons later in the trend, when the price gets quite a ways away from the moving average. Experience will tell you which to do. If you are new, place the break evens and take the chance that some trades will only break even that could have produced much more profit for you. At least you are keeping losses small that way. More experienced traders will just know when to place these break evens on their add on trades, as the market is very far off from the SMA.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Try using the nonlagdot indicator HERE , and use the color change as your trigger. This is what I am using on the 4 Hour and Daily with great success. GREEN pips to you Good Sir. ps On all the secondary addon trades, I move the SL to BE +2 pips as soon as I can which is even more important on shorter Time Frames.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Thanks for chiming in. I noticed that some pairs with better volatility would do better and have less false entries. Since we are looking at this in lower timeframes, I would think that it would be much more efficient in peak trading hours.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I have been working with M1 charts for years and I believe this method will work on the M1 charts. I have been catching the trend on the M1 charts for a while now and I really enjoy the fast pace of the M1 chart, I don't have sit in front of the screen for hours and hours, but I believe there are two small drawbacks with the M1 chart: 1. the price action can be so quick ( with the GBP/JPY pair ) that it is hard to get three or four trades closed quickly enough to avoid large slippages. 2. price action does not seem to respect S/R levels, moving averages, swing highs/lows QUITE AS WELL as on other time frames, which in my humble opinion makes the M1 slightly less predictable I am going to concentrate this method on the M5 chart and let there be green pips galore

How were you placing your stops? What did you do when the candle closed on the opposite side of the MA? for first trade i put 10 pips SL but i don't wait for it i close one a candle crossed the SMA, reentries no Sl, i am trading demo, so if i am live i may put it above the SMA or 10 pips . This is just one possible order entry trigger method, have you thought about others? I personally use something other than the SMA.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
[quote=NotMe;8744564] My pleasure. Here is a screen shot to explain what I meant. Candle 1 is the Primary Sell. Candle 2 would be the 1st secondary add on Sell and it is lower than the price at candle #1. Candle 3 would be the next secondary add on Sell and it is lower than the price at candle #2. The next two bull candles would not trigger secondary add on Sells since they are priced higher than the last trade at candle #3. Candle 4 would be the next secondary add on Sell and it is lower than the last trade at candle 3. The next 7 bull candles would not trigger secondary add on Sells since they are all priced higher than the last trade at candle #4. Candle 5 would be the last secondary add on Sell. Hopefully that helps you understand what I was trying to say. Any and all questions are welcome. Attached Image (click to enlarge) GREEN pips to one and all.

for those who asking me about my entries , I've made some changes to the original entry AND exit criteria and here it is Buy when : price close above 34 SMA Applied to LOW , Not Close Close Buy positions when : Price Close Below 34 SMA applied to HIGH not to LOW or CLOSE Sell when : price Close Below 34 SMA applied to HIGH , Not Close Close Sell positions when : Price Close Above 34 SMA applied to Low not to High or CLOSE You can Change the exist criteria from above HIGH to Above LOW And from Below LOW to BELOW High do some chart study and check it yourself and for the EA , i guess I'll release it after one week for extra improvements and finally , to avoid flat market , use AROON UP DOWN indicator applied to 100 for H4 chart. this is my key to stay in trend

Good News : some of the most important improvements to the EA are : you can close all the Positions when your Float Losses is -100$ for example (you decide) you can close all the Positions when your Float Profits is 150$ for example (you decide) you can close all the Positions when your Account Balance is Doubled x times (you decide) this is the current available settings for me to test (i may change it when i release the EA) Attached Image Final Result (H1 Chart GBP\JPY - start of 100$) NOTE : win/lose ratio is not important because losses are always small (in pips &amp; money) and we let profits run &amp; Multiply them !

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hello, I have been following this strategy with great interest and have a suggestion for the logic of the EA which I have been using in my manual trading, I believe instead of opening a new trade on each opposite candle we could have an option to set a pending trade a few pips above or below the opposite candle to take advantage of that price action and keep us from adding positions in a strong movement against the trend . We will haves a few less positions but less risk less drawdown and more efficient entries for our stacked trades. This concept has been successfully implemented in other strategies I have been apart of and is referenced in this article which is a successful automated strategy closely resembling this one. http://www.onestepremoved.com/swing-trade-trendless/

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Great work Tarwada; looking forward to this. Have you considered Close_Positions_Rule 3 - Close all positions if losses exceed "x" Percent of Account Balance? Could you run on H4 for same period for comparison? Well done!. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
That is very true. I put the suggestion forward for a trader who was concerned about excessive drawdown on a quick trend reversal. It will definitely reduce his risk, but it will also reduce his profit potential. The goal of any trader is to find the "Happy Medium" between risk and reward (And NO you cannot reduce all the risk and still have the reward). There are other ways to reduce the risk factor too. I personally have reduced the risk through a more responsive trigger method than the 34 SMA. GREEN pips to one and all, and enjoy your flight on "GREEN PIPS" airlines.

A couple of traders have also PM'd me requesting the indicator that I use as a trigger. Just as I explained to them, move the attached indicator to your MT4 Indicators Folder and insert it on to your Daily chart. Instead of the trigger being a cross of the 34 SMA, the trigger would be the color change of the NonLagDot (NLD) from Red to Blue for Buys, and Blue to Red for Sells. EVERYTHING else about Dreamliner's HFT system remains the SAME. Here is a screen shot with both the 34 SMA and the NLD indicators on the same Cad/Jpy chart that Dreamliner used for his illustrations.

seems as if from that one screenshot the NLD is more responsive than the 34 SMA. over time it is to observe if its more susceptible to whipsaws

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Due to its increased responsiveness, I believe it will have more whipsaws, BUT smaller whipsaws. It will also get into the trend quicker and out quicker reducing some of the losses on the secondary trades. Each trader should test and find the trigger that they are most comfortable with. There is NO Perfect trigger. The main focus should be on getting onto the "Flights" and staying on the "Flights" for the LONG haul. We want to participate and Buy as many "Tickets" to fly as we can. The trigger method is only a minor part of the strength of Dreamliner's HFT System. When you focus too much on buying a Ticket on the PERFECT "Flight" by avoiding any weather, air traffic delays, maintenance, or any other problems, you will miss too many "Flights." Some will not have gone to your desired location, but odds are many of them would have and you missed them. Because we want to buy as many tickets as we can, we have to make sure that the cost of the tickets, along with all of their maintenance, ground support and delay costs, is not too expensive. The two most important things that we need to do are to have a GOOD trigger method (NOT a PERFECT One), and to make sure that our Lot sizing is extremely conservative so that we can bare many (20 plus) worthless tickets because of delays of one sort or another. I know trading full lots is sexy and macho, but to do that on a portfolio of 12 or so pairs would require an account balance of at least $100,000 minimum, and more likely a lot more to be comfortable. I know .01 Lots aren't manly or exciting, but they can get the job of proving the system and increasing your account balance done. Dreamliner never promised an around the world first class trip on "GREEN PIPS" airline tomorrow to you. He gave you the tools to accumulate all the airline miles you will ever need to take such trips, but it will take time, study, participation, and commitment to see it through. GREEN pips to one and all.

In-spite of all capabilities of being a profitable system, however this System has following limitations (or deficiencies) (1) It provides no way to filter (or minimize) the SLs happening in ranging market. (2) Entry on Cross of EMA 34 is not a strong evident to go Short or long. (3) No exact way when to exit. As a forex geek, I made the following amendments to the system. Perhaps next week or week after, I will give a try to test following system. System Components: EMA 200, EMA 50, EMA 21 And Copock Indicator. System Concepts: (i) Bullish Trend: A pair will be in bullish Trend if EMA 200 less than EMA 50 and less than EMA 21 AND Price above all three EMAs. (i) Bearish Trend: A pair will be in bearish Trend if EMA 200 greater EMA 50 and greater 21 AND Price below all three EMAs. BUY Entry : (i) Bullish Trend (ii) Copock Greater than 0 &amp;&amp; Less than 1 (Green Line) Triger : Previous Candle with an open above 200 ,50 and 21 EMA, Low below 21 EMA and Close above 21 EMA. SL: A candle with full body below EMA 50 (or optionally below 21 EMA to keep DD low). TP: (a) Risk Reward Ratio. (b) Opposite copock Signal (copock crossing 0 from above to below) (c) Copock touch Level 1. SELL Entry: (i) Bearish Trend (i) Copock Less than Zero and Greater than -1 (Red Line) Triger: Previous Candle With an open below EMA 200,50,21, High above 21 and Close below 21. SL: A candle with full body above EMA 50.(or optionally above 21 EMA to keep DD low). TP: (a) Risk Reward Ratio (b) Opposite Copock Signal (copock crossing 0 from below to above) (c) Cupock Touching Level -1 RE-Entries: Re-Entries can be made each time the trigger is happening. With the condition that new entry must be on price better than previous trade. Why this much Specific definition of Trend? If we follow this definition, then it will in most cases Handle deficiency (1) Why this much Specification for Entry Trigger? This somehow guaranties that we are out of ranging market. And our trade is already in a right direction. And this specific trigger handles deficiency (2). The testing template and required indicator is attached. Wish you all Best of luck.

Dear, Either you don't have the knowledge of this thread or you have not read my previous comments.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
you would still put re-entries on every opposite candle (with the lower price) and enter the trade when the when SMA would cross the candle, like you would with Dreamliner's idea?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi Guys, One question about the strategy, on the re-entry after a candle close, what is the stop loss? Thanks

--- 帖子 #362 ---
thanks man, your entries was very helpful, can't wait for the ea. Green Pips for you.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
To be clear I do not use the SMA at all. I only use the NLD indicator and Buy on a change from Red to Blue and Sell on a change from Blue to Red. As for secondary entries, for the first two or three I only add on another position if all the positions before it are in profit. This protects against a tight ranging market condition near the initial entry and having too many open positions with SL's that have not been raised to BE +2 pips. Ideally, as the market trend moves with your position all of your entries will have had their SL's moved to BE +2 pips, so that your only risk will be the new add on secondary position's SL. Hopefully, this helps to clarify your question. GREEN pips to one and all.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
The SL for any of the add on secondary trades would initially be at the previous swing high or low. Then once the market has moved in its favor enough move the SL to BE +2 pips. GREEN pips to you my friend.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hello! What settings do you use for the NLD, please? I use the H4 TF.

i see the members participating in this style of tradeing are obviously big account holders and this method would not suit people with small accounts ,i trade live and have 1100 dollars held in margin for every trade i place so if i have 5 trades placed during the couse of the trend i would have $5500.00 held in margin which would make the trade untenable for me as the risk would be far to high

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Actually, my proof of concept account is only $1,000 and it handled this method just fine at .01 Lots per trade across 15 different pairs on both the H4 and Daily time frames for the last two plus weeks. GREEN pips to you Good Sir.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I appreciate what you are saying and i do not doubt the validitty but the point i was trying to get through is that i trade to live and this is not a hobby for me so for this to suite me i would have to have an account that is exponancially larger than the one i use at the moment and this i would suspect would apply to everyone else tradeing for a liveing.

Hi SmoothTrader, I'm still trying to make the NLD work for me and so far with mixed results leaning more to the loosing side of things, regretfully. How would you trade this EU chart, please?

Hi SmoothTrader! Thank you for your hints! I'm using 12h because it swings nicely and cTrader webversion has it. Mostly I preffer 8h chart because it fits to my daily schedule. How you trade the NLD, when it is repainting? With Regards, SP

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Explain more please

--- 帖子 #379 ---
The NLD does not repaint after the candle has closed, so that is why I do not take a signal until the open of the next candle. How do you like the cTrader platform? GREEN pips to you Good Sir.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Perhaps , you are emphasizing the three taps point? Along with cross of EMA, also confirm the three taps? Am i right? What would be precise definition for three taps?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
You're right, I look for any three taps once the candle closes below the 34SMA. As long as any three wicks hit a trend line I draw, they don't need to be three in a row either. The chart I attached chart is a good example. Also notice the second red candle under the 34 SMA takes out two swing lows, in other words, it closes below two swing lows.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Nice setup earlier this evening.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Wonderful Darryl. The trendline you draw and continuous failures to cross it is a great indication of trend change. And crossing of 34 SMA and taking out previous swings is a very good indication that Pair is getting momentum. I am somehow testing a different flavor of HFT. Off course cross of 34 SMA is no guarantee of trend change. Extremely danger . Also the method lakes consistancy across multiple timeframes. You will be getting a Long signal on one TF but on other TF , you will be getting signal for going Short. but mixed with few other things and improvement in the trigger can generate excellent results. I am testing the method on two timeframes (H4, H1) and till now results are excellent. Lets see its continuity. Note: Personally, i believe that without the study of Daily chart, Its almost impossible to detect trend change on H1.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Another nice set up this morning.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi! Thank you for your notice regarding waiting for the candle close. I like cTrader, because the user interface is modern, C# .NET programming capabilities and no MT Virtual Dealer Plugin. Many different timeframes including ticks. Web platform looks nice. From the second side it needs more computer ressources and ofcourse there are lot more written indicators, EA-s, etc for MT. Even I did not find how can I add scripts in cTrader. Rgrds, SP

--- 帖子 #386 ---
cTrader sounds like it may be a viable alternative to the MetaTrader fiasco that we have to deal with now. By eliminating the MT Virtual Dealer Plugins the broker is admitting that they will play fairly without any trying to mess with you via back-office tricks to maximize their income. As to the point about computer resources, if it has the capability to function on more than one of your computer's cpu cores at a time (MT4 is limited to a single core) that would be light years ahead of MT4. As to indicators, scripts, and EA's, as long as the MQ4 file is available then it should have the ability to be rewritten in C# or .NET fairly easily. My broker offers cTrader so I might have to get it and start playing with it. Thank you for your insights, and I'm glad that I was able to clarify why we wait for the candle to close. GREEN pips to you my friend.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi Darryl! Please tell me when do you enter the trades? Is it on the first candle that crosses the SMA?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Yes, I look for the first red candle to cross and close below the 34SMA. But I also want to see those three taps. Then I enter a trade. If I don't see those three taps, then I wait for the next candle to fully open and close below the 34 SMA, gives me confirmation that the price is headed down hill. But at this point, I have to say that I'm looking for other things too. For example, and this important. In the above chart that I posted post 385, I look at the red candle that crossed and and closed below the 34 SMA. It is the candle with the third tap. There is something else going on with that candle. The upper wick is greater than two out of three of the upper wicks directly before it and the upper wick is greater than three out of three candle bodies directly before it. I look for this stuff all the time. Well. its almost 10:30 PM here in Houston TX. Time to turn off the computer for the night, until tomorrow. This is just the way I trade now. I don't use any indicators, they just look good in hindsight.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
it's a very good strategy by the OP. my respect goes to the OP for sharing it to the public. my personal inputs here, higher high and higher low in an up trend and lower high and lower low in a down trend are still the key, which can be combined with the MAs for better understanding of the market intention.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi I read 10 pages of this thread I got the concept the only question arises in my mind is what's the idea behind using MA34, why dream liner choose this no. If this has been answered e before accept my apologies and Plz tell me again. Thanks

--- 帖子 #391 ---
As far as I know, that is a number and trigger that Dreamliner was comfortable with and was used to show the simplicity of a trigger choice without too many filters. He did mention that it was just a choice and that he was not saying that it was the only choice. In fact he encouraged traders to find whatever they were comfortable with. GREEN pips to you Good Sir.

Dear SmoothTrader, May I ask, what pairs are you trading on? With regards, SP.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
I trade a basket of pairs: A/J, A/U, Cad/J, E/A, E/J, E/N, E/U, G/A, G/J, G/N,G/U, N/J, N/U, U/Cad, and U/J. This is just my preference, and is no means the definitive or perfect basket for trading. I avoid the Swiss pairs because of the antics that the SNB pulled in Jan of 2015. I do not trade the exotics because of the size of the spreads which can be quite large, and that's also why I don't trade the other Cad pairs either . I don't trade the E/G and the A/N because they are closely correlated and not too volatile. GREEN pips to you Good Sir.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I tested this method (with few modifications), It works much better on offline charts for basket trading. This week, I got three baskets (260 PIPS (AUD)+460 Pips(GBP) +170 Pips (CAD) ), all three closed in profit. will continue the testing next week. The TP exit needs to be much better.

Hello sajidkust. You mean you build a basket with 7 pairs AUD,7 pairs with GBP and 7 pairs with CAD so will be totally 3 baskets? if yes what time frame you use? Thanks Regards

Just a friendly reminder... There are still some of us trading this, manually. There is not a need for us to post relentlessly about this method because it isn't intraday trading, it is a long term daily experience that will take some time to properly test. Results will then be put forth for the others to see. I think Dreamliner has put forth his ideas and is doing his thing and getting on with it, just like we are and it can't be rushed. Chris

Yes, takeoff and landing will my work, BUT the flight is making by autopilot and i dont sleep beetween a complety week, every view hours looking whats going on. For a coffee, a break and so on i left the cockpit and let the autopilot do the work. Michael ... ready for takeoff ... Edit: This system runs good for me.

this thread remind me of pipeasy thread, its similar imo. it doesnt matter what entry setup you use, as long as its fit to you &amp; you are comfortable with it. most of entries more likely hit sl and/or be, only few will survive long enough &amp; here come the rewards. i think the point is managing the trades. pipeasy even told us to practice 6 months to do x3 entries 20 sl 20 tp. too bad i dont see dreamliner after few pages, maybe he is busy at the moment. i also see too many 'addon' here, just my 2 cents. from a manual concept/method then after a few pages its turn into 'automatic' evolution haha i dont know if this was because too lazy to do it/too lazy to learn or what.. i assume the purpose is to learn &amp; practice to be a better trader. i dont mean ea is bad, i also use eas but not every system has to be ea.. p.s english is not my native language..

Hi SmoothTrader! Just couple of questions: 1. You said, in HFT you are entering after NLD changes the color. You are not waiting for first retracement as Lebaneese? Are you somehow avoiding the whipsaw? 2. If you are trading HFT on two timeframes and with 15 pairs, how many trades you are opening trough the week? I'm trading of 12 pairs on 12H timeframe. I started live account with 900 and position size is 0.01. Trough last 10 days I got 21 lost positions with -192USD, 11 open postitions are running now with +244USD. I'm using SMA34 for entry.

SuperPip, Sorry about the delay getting back to you, I have been on the road for a bit. I only use the NLD indicator from Mr. Lebaneese's thread. I don't use his entry method for this system. At the color change I initiate my Primary position with the stop loss at the previous swing high/low. The add-on Secondary positions are added at the close of retracement candles that are opposite to the trend color of the NLD indicator. The initial SL is the closest previous swing high/low, BUT on all Secondary positions I move the SL to BE + a few pips as soon as possible in case of an extended counter trend move or a change in trend, as indicated by the NLD indicator. I have set a maximum of 2 secondary positions that have not had their SL moved to BE + a few pips. This protects against a slow counter trend move that adds many Secondary positions before a confirmed trend change. The Daily Time Frame trades tend to have more staying power for me and between Primary and Secondary positions I am initiating about 15 to 20 trades per week. The 4 Hour Time Frame has the opportunity to have many more trades. I must admit that I abandoned trading that Time Frame not because of losses or the system not working but because I wasn't at my screen for too many of the signals. Even though I am a full time trader I am not at the screen for many of the 4 Hour Time Frame candle closes. Hopefully, this may help you with some of the whip-saw losses. A week or two, or even a month is not an absolute representation of this method. It is designed to make sure that you are able to participate in some of the BIG trends that occur in FX. Those trends do not happen all the time, but when they do they will multiply your account it ways you can only imagine. As for your Draw Down question, by my calculation you have a CLOSED Draw Down, but your account is positive over all. This is normal because your closed positions are ones that have hit their SL's. In the short time that you have been trading there has not been a nice trend move with the corresponding change of trend which would close many of your trades in nice profits. I use an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of my positions (both open and closed) with their corresponding risk levels. In that way, I keep on top of what the worst case scenario of all my positions hitting their SL at the same time would be. I will attach a working copy. GREEN pips to you my friend. Attached File(s) HFT D1 Risk Profile.xlsx 40 KB | 801 downloads ps if you should have any questions on the Excel Spread Sheet, PM me with them so we can keep the thread as clean as possible.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
thanks smoothtrader i've been trying your variation of HFT using NLD on D1 charts over the last 2 weeks or so and i must say that the system really works and with absolutely minimal screen time /maintenance needed, a true EOD system and a profitable one. literally takes 5 minutes if that at the end of each day. hats off and thanks for the above info, have added to my HFT clipboard green pips to you and everyone else on this thread and have a great day

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hi SmoothTrader, I was curious about your method, thank you for sharing. If I may ask, what is your TP target? Are you just "blindly" following colour changes or do you also consider other patterns (wedges, H/L and such)? Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I like to say that, I as a trader am not smart enough to know exactly where the market is going to go, so I do not set a TP. I let the market take me for a ride and when it has reached its goal I take my profits. If it was just a fake-out and the market continues on its way, that's ok too because I can always re-enter the market and build my positions again. Hopefully that sheds some light on how I approach the market. GREEN pips to you my friend.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
It did, thank you. So if I understand you correctly, if you get a false (say, 1-2 dots the opposite direction), you take and none the less, right? IF so, isn't the whipsaw killing your profits in times of a long range? Thank you for replying.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Yes I do have losses on those occasions where the color changes ever couple of candles, but that usually only occurs in a realtively flat ranging market so it doesn't go to my SL, but changes before that. It would be nice to eliminate the small losses during ranging markets, but it is impossible and should be viewed as a cost of doing business. If you too many filters on to eliminate the ranging market, you will also lose a good portion of a trending market too. GREEN pips to you and your family.

Dear brother, I have already shared each and every step of my strategy and i also shared the indicators in this forum. And i also sent it via mail whoever requested it. Few in this forum will witness this if I am true. Would you please bother to go few pages back and see what i am saying? This is the problem with newbies that they always ask to feed them like baby and they don't like to know how to hunt. Anyhow, i don't mind this as i am also a newbie and you can see my stupid questions from senior traders right at the start of my FX career. Anyhow, you should be thankful to me, i am sharing my trades as soon they are taken. I don't like to share trades which have already hit the TP. I believe that Loosing trades are great source of learning rather wining trades. So anybody else should also show the courage and share the trades as soon as they took it. Update: The USD-4 basket that was open yesterday has hit the TP and 300 more green pips.

Thoughboy, I asked sajidkust for his stuff and he sent all to my email. So please be cool and if you want something please ask first. Many pips to all.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I just have to thank ... but yesterday I asked the indicators to my email and did not send me ... I shall be grateful if send to my email the indicators robinho13456@gmail.com a big hug

--- 帖子 #451 ---
It was morning and I wasn't clear on my question, I think You follow each color change or wait for your SL or TP to get hit? Do you open two opposite trades or trade one direction at a time. Again, thank you for replying, it really helps.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Brother, I have sent you the mail again. Sorry if i missed you. I am a human. Can miss.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Thank you friend ... stay in peace.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
i received your template , indicator and strategy document from someone not from you. you only sharing this not the actually the basket control indicator which in my opinion is the brain of that strategy. so why you not sharing the basket control indicator.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
I am short on CAD-5. Only 3 pairs executed. EURCAD and USDCAD filtered out from entry basket as they are not following the flow. Its not good time to execute the basket but i have to take it because its an entry according to the rules of system.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I am unable to mount the method ... the basket does not appear to me ... I know it's annoying to giving work for you, but it would be cool to ride a tutorial. "I think I'm asking too much" excuse me ...

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Dear Brother, Its clearly not the way to go. From your profile, i noticed that you are from Pakistan also and I also Pakistani National. Its really tough for me to digest how you are quoting me. Anyhow, i will clarify things to you. The basket control thing is not mine. Its of somebody else and while coding that element it was my agreement that i will not personally share that element but can use it for my personal use. And why he was stopping me from sharing it in personal, there is a long FF story behind . What happen with tools of that trader in past is a sad story to revise. So its not possible for me to share basket control thing. However, this has nothing to do with my strategy which i am sharing all the required stuff. I just use it to monitor my basket, basket execution, Re-Entry and Lot control . That's it. I hope , i have clear the things. If you are still interested in Basket Control, then PM me, i will share the name of owner of that control with you. If he likes, he will share it with you.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Brother i have sent you a PM. In the HTF folder i mailed to you, you will find a word document. Everything is explained in that document. Strategy, Examples, Environment, and how to set up offline charts. I think you have not noticed the word document.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I see the word document, but the problem is not reading,,, have difficulty finding the tools in MT4, for example: "Right Click on Script, and click Represh." where is represh? but I read your email ... another question ... the basket control configuration will appear to me?

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Sorry about that Good Sir. I trade in one direction at a time, so if the color changes I close all my positions and start a new. May GREEN pips not only fill your account, but also your life.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Sorry Its just spelling mistake. Its "Refresh".

The CAD-5 basket ending on hitting 120 PIPS SL. Ohhhhh what a loss. It just kissed my SL and then moved hard in my direction.

Recovery. Quick hand.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
my other setup with slight changes. a bit risky. But it has doubled my account this week.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I have shared the system with more than 30 people . And i encouraged them all to please share their baskets as soon as they enter rather sharing when basket hit the TP. And this way hiding the trades which hits SL. Still nobody shared any basket so a bit disappointment for me. Share the trades as soon as you enter. There is no shame if your basket hit SL . This way we will all learn. Only sharing wining trades gives wrong illusion of strategy. People giving a perception of Holly grail by just sharing the trades which has already hit the TP. By doing so, too many people misguided on forums. Let be true to the forum. We can learn much from our SLs rather our TPs. Wish you all green pips.

CAD-2 hitting its TP and 180 PIPS pocketed.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Brother, Perhaps either you are not following the thread, or not following my mail or not followed the document or not opened the folder i provided or even you don't know exactly how to setup the offline charts. How many times , I have clarified that whats the basket control is and what is its function but still the same damn questions and points. Anyhow, I wish you green pips.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
To whoever i provided the system, I offered them that I can assist happily if they can't setup. But still......................

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I can't share my trades because I don't trade this system. I have another platform than Metatrader (JForex - broker Dukascopy) and I have to prepare my basket trading solution. It will take some time. sajidkust thanks for big inspiration!

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Yes brother, i know that. Please let me know if i can be of some help. Due to the few limitations of Offline charts in MT4, i am studying alternate plateforms like cAlgo , if they offer something which i need, then i will switch to cAlgo. There i have the advantage of programming in C# which is know since 2004.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hello,Sajidkust. Thank you for the system explanations and indicators.I also want to thank Dreamliner ...seems like it is a good way to trade...unfortunately,I am studying another system right now...so I will try yours later,because I don't like to jump from one strat to another...I think you'll understand. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
A pity that out very early CAD - 5. I would be so now:

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Brother, I am in no way in competition with you. I wish CAD keeps moving in your trade direction next week too. I wish green pips. I have made enough today, I can't count the pips to be true. I am attaching just today's report and leave it to you to count the pips. The system, you are using now. Perhaps, i have used more advance system than this one year ago. but the problem with such system is where to set the SL and where to set the TP. This is very important. Otherwise, you will be getting very good entries but ending in loss or you cutting your profits too early. for your reference, i am just sharing a photo of my old good friend.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
looks like a dashboard, eyecatching

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Brother, This is an old system which i developed one year ago. Perhaps my first ever Dashboard. Its just for the reference Carneiro brother.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Ok Dear Fellows, This may be perhaps my last post here because few of the traders don't like it as i got few PM's . I tried my level best , to be as true to the thread and newbies as a human can be. I tried my best to explain the strategy as much as i can. And to everyone i offered the help if they can't setup the offline charts and how i arrange on MT4. But it seems a different mindset here. I am posting it as update to my baskets which entry i announced before when i was entering the baskets. I will keep running these baskets till it hit the TP. If it don't hit TP till London tomorrow , then i will manually close the baskets as i don't like to trade Friday. Wish you all green pips.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
And this one more for you Carneiro and toughboy. This is the whole board, i am used to. Now please don't ask that I must/should share the system. Its just to clear your mind. I am using this dash just as easy reference to my trades rather having it in Automation with this strategy. It's not auto for this strategy. I should have not shared it here but you people just forced me to do it. Note: The design is copyright of Glory.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
And this is one more toughboy. This is full Auto. Tell me which one you want. But first assure me the ethics , you must show in PMs and on forums.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Or you need this. This is full auto "Breakout Dashboard" with proven results. But first assure me the ethics .

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Or you need this one. A full auto News Trading Basket dashboard. Do you need this one? Assure me Ethics and get all this from me. You must have to prove that you deserve it. Wish you all Green PIPS. And Good Bye.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
awesome,,, brilliant ... fantastic I deserve a gift that...would welcome the panel: post 488

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Thanks for your help/posts sajidkust. I came to this thread just a few days back. Wish you all the best.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Thanks Sajidkust, as I am going to run your system in one account, it is difficult to monitor different baskets' running at the same time, the basket dashborard will be so helpful. I like that on #488.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Dear Sajidkust, Thank you for sharing your trading style and your results are inspiring. For me it takes some time to fully understand the logic behind it, test and start to trade with it. First I have to create my own basket view, your screenshots are beautiful here. Without a dashboard is quite complicated to trade it. With many thanks, SP

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hello Sajid to be true, i found you a VISIONARY person and you are real man of crises. its sad for me that you are been disturb by two stup.. ds. Please do not let yourself down. Stick to your standards. Thats not your standards what i have seen in posts here. I am thankful to you that you always give a 10 step further idea then my thoughts. Plz do continue here. I am not mean so i will not set silent and will stand with you loud and clear. Just ignore the shits and move forward. Don't become a spoon feeder. They will never recognize it neither value it. you will one day agree to my idea. i have just sent my first gift to mom via your web https://www.ediblearrangements.com . It was so nice experience.

Here are my results for February 2016; All trades are 0.10 size on the Daily charts I trade 29 pairs including gold (all pairs with EUR, AUD, GBP, CHF, JPY, CAD, USD, NZD) I open after every cross of 34 ema with SL above last swing I open a new trade after each opposite color candle, no SL I move the stop to BE+ as soon as possible I close half the trade (0.05) at 1000 points (100 pips) I close another (0.02) the trade at 5000 points (500 pips). Leaving the trades at 0.03 Here is the graph for Feb. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is the open profit currently Attached Image See you next month.. Chris

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Interesting results. How long have you been using HFT and how many pairs do you trade? Do you stick to a specific TF? I am just beginning a trial with the NonLagDot indicator using a similar trade concept of entering extra on any opposite colour candle. I will be trading on the daily time frame on all the major pairs. I will post my results in a month or so when I get to grip with the strategy. Thanks for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Thank you Chris for sharing your results, and for sharing your methods. I certainly like how you harvest some of your positions to help to replenish your account balance. By doing it methodically, as you propose, you take the emotional aspect of trading out of the equations, and this can be a very good thing. Keep up the good work, and we all look forward to your updates. GREEN pips my friend.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
SuperPip, That is great to see that your flight was a smooth one, and that it took you to a nice destination with many GREEN pips awaiting you upon your arrival. You can see that even a flight of just a week or two can generate many pips. These will go a long way to pay for some of the inevitable delays that will come with some ranging markets. Now imagine if you can a flight that lasts not a week or two, but lasts for months at a time. That is where the greatest potential lies. Once you reach your destination, there will be thousands of pips waiting for you. I also find it interesting that you are trading the 12 H TF instead of the more common Daily or 4H TF's. I am currently only trading the Daily TF because I found that I was missing too many 4H setups/closings/trades because I was away from the screen. Daily is easy because it is only once a day, but I can also see where the 12H TF would just about as easy with twice the opportunities to initiate positions. Keep up the good work, and please keep every one here on the thread informed of your progress. Who knows, maybe more of us will begin to look at the 12H TF. Enjoy your well deserved GREEN pips, and be sure to share them with your family and friends for that is where their greatest value lies.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Thanks for the kind words Smoothtrader. Yes I like the idea of taking a bit off the table early on because the end of a lot of trends end with an abrupt up/down candle or swing which would take a lot of the profits away from open trades, also I can't say when a trend is exhausted so banking is the way to go I feel. If you look at the graph you may notice it smoothes out the line a lot more...(towards the end) Will you be posting monthly results too? Chris

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I will be posting Monthly results beginning with March. I am using a different trigger, so it will be interesting to compare the two results. Until then keep up the good work at not only being a student of Dreamliner's HFT Method but also being an observant student of the market itself. GREEN pips to you my friend, and enjoy the well deserved rest and relaxation of this fine weekend upon us.

i'm new with this &amp; opened a cent account (live), i know it's not a big money but i think this will really different compared to demo, on demo i leave all the trades for days &amp; so on, but in live acc this way different to me haha.. almost close the trade even if it's only 100 pips i need to build my mindset or mental or whatever it's called.. i'm following smoothtrader approach, using nonlagdot, mainly on h4 &amp; h1, still not sure what timeframe that suit with me, thanks for smoothtrader hope to see more example so i can be better with my practice..

Hi. Where is our pilot. Is he flying well? Thank you dreamliner, your method is add-on winners and profit on big swing. So good!

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Still coming here on FF but don't expect him to be back on this thread ... I am quite sure that the last 20 pages or so made him quit. That's sad but fully understandable ...

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I have read through all the posts. The trading logic is simple, but the add-ons are very aggressive. I wish there will be some discussions about unexpected situations something like the trend didn't go further and turn around which caused the add-ons to have total losses greater than the total profits of previously established positions. What to do in this scenerio?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
wowwww, going through dreamliner profile, 49 threads started and then left. This may be one other. Perhaps he want to complete his fifty.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
I doubt his goal is to open a thread then left ... The problem is that this tread (at least) has gone too far from its original purpose. As an OP, I would have left in this same situation.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
This is normal. It happens with almost every thread. Thread opener posting the original idea and people finding their own way of comfort. they mixed with something with which they feel comfortable. sometimes, amazing strategies came out of initial idea+mixing but sometimes, people realize that they have polluted the originality.But the point is that thread opener should not leave the thread and he/she should encourage people to test differently. A thread is a thread. everybody should be open to express his/her thoughts and it must not be considered as a must to follow.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
...reminds me of Floyd Mayweather 49-0 Maybe he's still just above the clouds (literally) and his idea seems to work for him and others but not for everybody. The best thing is that, he shared his ideas and see if these will work with us too. Sharing his strategy I think would benefit him the most as he doesn't have much time to look further in case of some other flaws that he wasn't able to see or maybe to see if others can add more relevant information or suggestions that seems to be viable. His job as an airline Pilot takes a huge amount of time of his love/life, and right now, he maybe flying above 30,000 feet but opposite of a jet stream. On the side note, I wanted to become an Airline Pilot before, a high paying job (annual salary between 63KUSD - 125KUSD), surrounded by beautiful fight attendant, and huge responsibility. Anyway, I ended up with a flight attendant

Hi All Dears, By viewing few previous posts i concluded that some of the serious and mature traders have a genuine concern about the objective of thread. and it should be. The dreamliner has presented his awsome trading secrets and strategies for low risk and high reward gains but with apology few of us are running behind Ea,s some are looking for extra confirmation indicators and many of us are thinking about entry and exit methods. These are are fine to every one but what is the objective of this thread ? when the all rules has been defined by the Dreamlner? here is my suggestion that instaed of adding new things and changing the face of this thread it would be better to discuss the currency pairs very close to 34 SMA, their scope , probable enrty point. target and exit, as well as the good opportunities to add on the positions. by this method we can share screen shots and ask from senior members regarding the setup validity and comments . further more as dynamic market there is always some trneds are just going to start and some are at the verge of end. we should discuss the fresh trend starting pairs, their validity and strength and discuss upon it thoroughly in the light of directions of dreamliner , so we can be benifited this resource full method and the dreamliner may help us in his kind spirit. Let me start this thing with a chart of cadjpy which has just open a 4h candle on the 34sma and trend is going to start in buy direction. senior members are requested to comment positvely on possible entery price and method and possible target. and like that other pairs which are close to Sma on daily basis Dear dreamliner missing you so much. please came forward and guide us

--- 帖子 #510 ---
a good trading system or trader posts a working future trade and works till target is achieved, historical charts are many, even i cvan post a holy grail system from historical charts because i know i will fail to read the future movements of the markets like i always do.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I hope someone will come forward and will keep the thread active by showing their trades right at entry time. Rather talking like philosophers in every thread, its better to move forward at least with something. Rather hunting newbies in every thread , its better to be true to them.

Hi SmoothTrader, I am trying to switch to the daily timeframe with the exact same reasons that you have. However, I do have a question based on the SL that you put based on the last swing. I noticed that the stop loss can go as high as 200 to 300 over pips? What do you do when it comes to this? thanks..

Hi! I'm trading HFT with NLD on H12 and going well. I got situation where price goes continuously up and there are no retracements. How to multiply then? After every closed candle or use a grid? Any suggestions? Attached Image With regards, SP.

For me after every close in my direction. This means you are going to wind up with some scalps. I do it that way because you never know which candle will be the tall candle.

Unfortunately seems so. A shame really I was enjoying Dreamliner's gentle way of teaching and what he was showing was very valuable I felt.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
So sad to see that what seems to be a profitable system, a lot of followers who got off the topic scared the originator away. I still think I will be studying and following the method. I don't think that the EA caused the thread creator to leave but simply the deviation of original method and topic.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
hi guys , i read all the information about the HFT stategy... I think is a good one... the main problem I see is what do you do when the market is already in movement ( down or up... ), how to input the market, you never know is the market reach the top or the bottom... how to reduce this kind of risk...only with stop loss... for to add some trade I resolve the problem but I have to have near the beginning of the movement, look the picture.... sorry for my English... have a green's day Liberty55

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi Liberty, Like any other form of trading, we never know when there is a top of a bottom. I too have been looking at something to add in order to minimize losses especially when the 34 MA is flat. I have experimented with the EA that was developed out of this system and am coming to the conclusion that the profits are much greater than the run of losses that may occur during the crossing of the 34 SMA. I think the expressions that need to be used here are exponential growth and linear losses. The NLD seems to be a good way to minimize some of the losses but I am still thinking and scratching my head at something more efficient. If anybody have any good ideas along with examples and proof to how we can minimize losses around the range and curvature of the 34 SMA, your thoughts are welcomed. I am thinking of possibly making my own EA of this system with a moderate twist, but not straight away as it is time consuming and rather discuss ideas first. Cheers! Daniel

--- 帖子 #534 ---
thank you... i word to improve this system because I am sure it is good but we need to inter at the right place no matter what kinf of MA we use... Liberty 55

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I've read some posts of this topic and I must say that all of veteran traders go back to simple methods after a period of struggling with lots of indicators and methods because we change our view to the market and this business after a period of time if we are still in it. I believe, and I think the starter of the topic would think so, that the strong suit of this strategy is in managing and adding entries otherwise you can use any MAs with any periods or you can use other methods such as trend lines, which I think more accurate than random MAs, for finding the beginning of a trend. However I think a moving average with a correct period is more accurate than anything else but the question is what the correct period is? For answering to this question let's get back to the concept of MAs and see what they are supposed to show us. As you all know an MA is an average of candles' prices that can be high, low etc. and the theory of using them is that any phenomenon tends to balance. MAs show us a trend where the price gets to a balance between sellers and buyers. Sometimes sellers disturb this balance and sometimes buyers. So this is a fight between them to win and change a trend. When they do that they make several tops and bottoms which make a trend. These tops and bottoms in a trend have a symmetry to its previous trend and will have symmetry to future trend however there will be some changes but the symmetry still works and we can use that. These changes are logical because every market is dynamic not static and every time there are people entering and exiting who can make bigger trends that you can see in higher timeframes but as I said small trends and tops and bottoms still work and have symmetry to their counterparts. Having said that, we can use every random MA we like but if we want to be more precise I think it's better to take advantage of this symmetry to find the right period for our MA and be dynamic as the market is. By doing that we not only find a period for our main MA but we can find right periods for smaller trends and use those MAs for adding better entries instead of every opposite candle. I've worked on this theory for years and I'll show you how it works with some photos in my next post however it takes some time to get used to it and can understand and use it properly. Hope it'll help you make this strategy more effective.

LAST POST OF THE NIGHT. Well, it's late here in the UK and I thought I would post what I like to call my results with "Accidental Settings" I was playing around with the settings as per usual and then I decided to put a value in LOT to 0.01 Now the reason I did this is because I was always filling in the next box Risk Percent to 1.01 which was fine. In the old settings way, leaving the Lot to "0" and Risk Percent to 1.01, the backtesting was always trading 0.01 lots on each position being open. Here is what I don't understand but have welcomed it. With Risk Percent left at 1.01 and Lot at 0.01, it started martingaling the strategy of buys and sells. I only noticed this a lot later during the test as I noticed that my initial demo deposit of £500 did not crash As you will see from the attached results I am to post, the Max DD is very deep. £729.55 (please note this is GBP and NOT USD) Altogether and surprisingly I am very pleased for what to me I call "Accident Settings" The test ran from 01/01/2015 to 31/03/2016 with pleasing results. This to me is encouraging for an EA that only has half a strategy built in. Hope you all have a wonderful day/night! Daniel

Hi All Here are the results for March with graph and open P/L Please refer to quote for last months results and the description of how I trade HFT Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image Chris see you next month

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I refer to this line of yours... "I only noticed this a lot later during the test as I noticed that my initial demo deposit of 500 did not crash" It didn't crash because of when you started doing the testing and that is obvious from your results BUT you have bigger DD then your $500 starting capital and if you started testing when this big DD happened your account would have crashed alright and quite easily. The bottom line is that your account must start with sufficient funds to sustain the biggest DD you attained during testing and then some more. Hope this helps.

OOOPS! Even BIG OOOPS! I posted something in the wrong thread. Sorry! Daniel

Hello ALL MY Dear Traders, Just leave the backtest as its just a shit. The backtest is best for tracking bugs in your work rather results. I am running an EA for this strategy non-stop 24/5 without manual interruption since a month, Below is the link to its results. But most importantly, for me the following points are important. (i) This method woks well 2 hours after Tokyo open till the NY Open especially on week opening. NY will eat up your profits and then late night, you will again start gaining your results. (ii) Individual pairs will never give you results of your liking , instead tightening the method to a whole basket(currency group) will make more sense because when when a currency pairs move as a whole then it make more sense rather the movement of a single pair. (iii) The method is not consistent in making profits although overall you will be in Net Profit. But it may take days or weeks to again start your wining streak. (iv) Its better to use emergency exit. I am using the NoLagDot as emergency exit. My all other exits were based on Either on Profit Lock, Risk to Reward . https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/176876 ​Since the method is lacking consistency(although profitable) so i don't recommend to adopt it for real money.

Hi guys In my previous post I talked about finding the right period for our MAs by using previous wave and sometimes waves (bottoms/tops) by the means of symmetry. Now I'm going to show this with some pics. First we need to pay attention to previous wave or trend. It might be an uptrend or downtrend, it doesn't matter we just want to set our MAs according to its tops (if it's a downtrend) or bottoms (if it's an uptrend). While we're doing this we try some numbers so that we can find the right one that fits the top or bottom. What's the right one exactly? The right one is the Ma that touches the closes or shadows of the candles but it doesn't touch the bodies. You can see this process in the following photos. This is the main picture of this method but there are some details that I'm gonna write to answer some probable questions. You can use any type of MA (simple, smoothed etc.) but I use simple/close. If you use for example simple for an MA you should use simple for all other MAs. The number of MAs is depending on the bottoms or tops of previous wave. Sometimes there are lots of waves in a trend with little difference in bottoms/tops that you might get confused but don't be and pick out the three ones that stand out more. For the strategy of this thread we need 3 or at most 4. We use main MA as trigger and small ones for adding on. Don't be rigid about the period of MAs. The market is dynamic and changes itself so you can update yourself according to it. You will get used to it after awhile and you can make your own strategy based on this method if you want. I will be around if you have any questions and be happy if I can help. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...8&amp;d=1459509848

The thread originator stated that he adds to his original position anytime a candle closes in the opposite direction of the trend. He further stated that if he is awake he adds a stop loss + break-even to additional positions once they have moved a reasonable distance in his favor. Every trader is going to have a tolerance for risk that is unique to him/her. I come from the camp that believes you MUST take systems like this and adapt it to your own tolerance levels. Asking others about reducing risk is an exercise in futility as trader A can see his position go 50 points in his favor before retracing 55 pips and then going back in his favor another 144 pips while trader B would be devastated to see 50 points of profit go into 55 points in the red. Systems can be shared - risk tolerance cannot.

I think this might have been buried so I am reposting with a quote here. Smoothtrader I hope you are still trading this and are going to post a result for March...

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I wonder a bit if just taking authoritative closes above/below the MA would help in picking trends. e.g. a 20 pip plus bar on 1 hour, as per the cornflower method.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
thank enochben, my main idea was to explore if some peoples have a better way to assume some risk and/or if we can improve how to reduce the risk ... I know about stop loss and BE we discuss about a long position system...may be for the input new trade we can take the low or high( depend the MA)of the previous candle for the input and stop loss with the high or low for that candle and after a move in your direction about 50-100 pips at BE for that candle presently I have a test and I have 19 trade in the maket and I have 17 at gain. I worked with a nano lot...start a demo with $250 now I have $315.07 with $55.14 on the market prsently...continue the test because the main difficulty is the reverse situation when you have more trade in the maket...I will anticipate some reaction from the market and I analyse what will the best strategy to adopt....in my case, I move the stop loss from the trade at gain to the value little high from the MA until now it is working( I have protect 12 trades )... I am waiting for the end of the movement ( GPBJPY) sorry for my bad english Have a nice day liberty55

Hello High321, Is this EA supposed to be attached to one chart for it to manage all trades on all pairs or it has to be on every chart being traded?Your reply shall be appreciated. Thanks for the share.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
note - and it is just my opinion -- leave the DEMO account behind. If you are putting on nano units you are risking nickles and dimes but it is REAL money! Trading with real money is much more emotional than trading with monopoly money. The demo gives you false confidence and there is no emotional attachment, real money is just different. Find an account that lets you deposit small amounts and start playing with real cash. If you need suggestions for small account brokers, PM me. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi. Thanks for the details on how you are trading this wonderful system using NLD. Are you still trading this the same way? Now regarding the SL when you are using previous swing high low, is it not too big on a daily tf? Also are you using any indicator to determine the swing hi lo?

--- 帖子 #552 ---
One thing missing from this thread (forgive me if I overlooked this) is how to properly pyramid your position for maximum profits. In ultra simplified terms always make your initial entry at the start of the trend your biggest position and when adding to your position decrease size as the trend extends. For example if you entered the dragon (GBPJPY) at 184 - and the maximum size you are comfortable with is 10 units, this is where you should load up with all 10. Then say price moves in your direction 300 pips and there is a retrace and add-on trigger at 181.50 - you should never add on the same size. This is so if price goes against you you can still trade out with some profit. If you add another 10 units here and price continues to move against you, you will wind up with nothing. So lets add 8 units here. So price goes another 200 pips in your favor. At the next trigger add 5 units. Then three, then 1. So after a 900 pip move, any additional positions should be small (1 pip) so that when the trend ends abruptly you can trade out of your position with most of your profits intact. I hope this makes sense. It takes some practice, but once you grasp it, you will see how to let your profits run.

been following Dreamliners strategy from 21st Mar , started a live account with £500 , as of today profits at £1400 after withdrawing the capital . I only use 4hr charts across all pairs . What a wonderful difference this has made to my trading mindset - cut losses to minimum and exponentially multiply the profits , have patience and be a rule based trader , and apply your mind as we r traders not robots ... Ever so thankful to Mike ..

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Wow! Impressive...

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hi, can you share some more details? How you go about cutting your losses to minimum i.e., where you place your stop loss for the first trade and the subsequent add ons? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Exactly same as Dreamliner has suggested . Stop loss at previous swing high/low , re entry on pullback candles and moving stop loss to break even once trade moves to your direction .requires patience and balls of steel when you see a profit of £500+ but stay on it as we follow rules . Sometimes £500+ turn out to £5 if market changes direction , but that's part of the rule .

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Thanks for your response. I have few more questions and the reason I am asking is because I came across this thread couple of months back and really like the system and the way it was presented, Thanks to Mike for that, but unlike you I have not managed to apply this system to get success so far and the reason could be lack of patience and discipline as you mentioned. 1. When you use previous swing high/low on H4 that would be quite far away i.e., the Stop loss would be big or you use previous swing high/low on say H1? 2. Do you any indicator for previous swing high/low? 3. You correctly said it requires balls of steel to see a large profit come down to almost negligible, so how you decide when to exit the trade and book profits? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi!May I ask, what pairs you are trading?regards,SP profits at 1400 after withdrawing the capital . I only use 4hr charts across all pairs .

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I look for all pairs , but enter only which has touched the resistance/support atleast twice before crossing the 34 SMA Previous Swing is on H4 , someetimes it may be hundred pips away ,but i dont trade big lots at all.. thats the risk we take on this business i guess. No indicators whatsoever, follow Dreamliners rules ..mentally you got to be stong to enter orders on pullbacks when previous two pullback orders are already running at loss , the idea is it will go in your direction at some stage..

--- 帖子 #561 ---
&lt;/p&gt;[/quote] I look at all pairs, but choose ones which has hit resistance/support atleast twice before crossing 34 SMA..

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Thanks, one final question. Foe example a buy order where the stop loss is say 100 pips (previous swing low) and the candle closes below the SMA 34, you close the trade or you wait for it till it hits your Stop loss or go back up?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
As i said follow Dreamliner rules ,if candle closes below SMA on a buy order ,dont wait for SL ,just exit.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Do you have any particular criteria for which pair you enter on or do you have positions on all the pairs you can? And for such a small account what sort of lot sizing are you using?

--- 帖子 #565 ---
i avoid correlated pairs, i start with 0.1 , then 0.05 subsequent entries on pullbacks.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Quite a choppy week..ranging market.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Thanks Mike for this method, works like a charm in H4 TF ,need patience to sit on trades for week or more but definitely working ! Net profit at £1800 after taking the £500 deposit out.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
instead of choosing pairs - a quick look at a basket chart shows that this system can be quite good. - care taking choosing a TF (H1 and H4 look good) - care taking when choosing your indicator (i.e SMA or oscillator) would be a good solution to the "what pair" question... only problem is the price you pay in the spread

--- 帖子 #569 ---
guys this strategy works like a charm in h4 tf , £2500 profit in 10 weeks ,started with £500 deposit using 0.1 and 0.05 lots

Works like a charm if price is trending. What pair are you trading and how do you chose them? Thanks.

​Hello disciplined is this correct according to your explanation? Thanks TS Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Please ease take time to read Dreamliners post , range is unavoidable and subsequent loses , key is keep loss to minimum and exponentially multiply profits when in trend , you need patience to see profits . I have no preference with pairs , avoid correlated ones , jpy pairs moves quicker

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Thats correct ,but nothing is perfect , you will eventually find the trend and so key is to add positions with all pullbacks aligned to your money management

Hi, Dreamliner, I have really enjoyed your analogies to flying a plane; I think you and I think alike because I have at times compared mine to an F14 as it lifts off the support of the carrier. Have you ever watched one; as the wheels leave the carrier, there's a drop towards the water as the air craft takes flight. My question is on when you trade. It sounds like your job keeps you away from your computer quite a bit, as mine does. Do you live in the states or abroad? How often do you fly? I imagine you live abroad because I believe I read that you use Oanda . So many brokers won't register folks in the US. I live in Oklahoma, by the way. I agree with you, I've never had any luck with an EA but I'm experimenting with entry orders which requires a lot of guess work. Do you have any suggestions on that? My strategy has similarities but is different, but I'm picking up a lot of great tips from you. Ours are similar in that there is very little window for the entry and it's where it gets frustrating. From reading some of the posts here, I want to encourage folks to find a strategy and stick with it. When you bounce from one idea to another, you're just giving your money away. I like what you have said about the range movements and especially during these times, you will have loses, but keep them small and capitalize on the strong trends. Many times, a loss is emotional and we start looking for another strategy. We all must learn to accept losses; the trick is to keep them smaller than the successes. Dreamliner, I am in AW of what you do. I HATE to fly; I just don't do it enough to get comfortable; each flight is a nail-biter. But I particularly HATE dealing with TSA. My goal in trading is to bring in enough income that I can charter a small jet to fly privately anywhere I want to go. That's what I'm working on. God be with you in this ridiculous world these days. I wish you safe flights.

I think , it is time to say THANK and share the picture... I modified some part of the idea and it is work for me : I use the D1 TF and all the position is the same size, and I add a second trade for each position with a target and the first one still open...I put also 2 indicator's plus the MA ( for the definition what is the uptrend and the downtrend, in reality you can take any value for the MA but you have to have to respect you direction definition for the market... no need to look any pull back for adding position, only definition the step bethween each of them ( you need to be confortable with , in my case I add each positions ( 1 with no target and the second with the before the next position you wan to add...) I also trade with real money with the nano lot... I started 2016-03-30 with $250 now I have a balance of $684.51 and an equity around $740... not bad if you think % from the bank give you... Sorry for my English... Have a nice day and alot of green pips Liberty55

hi RebeccaH, I read your post and I was very frustered when I missed some entry ( live in Mtl) this is why I change the strategy deamliner ans adapt to my restriction, I don't like to be in front of my computer for a long hour to analyse the market... and to miss entry, with my method ( nano-lot, good space bethween each ^position ( 2 trades, one no target the second with target before the next position, I don't need to pass long time in frnt of compuetr... nI began with a 0.01 nanot and 0.05 ( target) ans somme time I missed to put more trede but I NEVER put my account in DANGER becaus my MM...

H4 TF, all pairs, avoid co-related ones , all rules per dreamliners posts. I dont have acct linked to any website

--- 帖子 #596 ---
when i started with £500 , my first order was at 0.1 lot then at 0.03 for pullbacks, once profits banked, i moved to 0.2 lots entry and 0.1 on retrace. you will lose some ,or many, but when you win ,you'll win big thats the principle.

Hardly hear from Dreamliner now .... would love to have some fresh input from the originator of this tread.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hi, I just stumbled onto your post, and I would love to know what is this strategy that you have tested.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
I've taken a total of 4 accounts to this kind of profit using this method. I still trade it. But you definitely get a "feel" for when to not put on additional add-on trades. It requires practice to get this "feel". When I was learning to fly my instructor told me I would soon learn to fly "by the seat of my pants". Your trading account(s) really begin to grow when doing so.

The student has surpassed the teacher .

Is anyone trading this way actively? I love this concept and im testing it on the 5 min with my own variation, it would be awesome if there was an active thread with traders pushing the pip count limits of single market moves.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
This is my dream too, but I keep missing them, and I don;t have an exact strategy. will you help me?

--- 帖子 #617 ---
There is no secret, everything is in this thread. This is all you need to do 1. Keep losses small. ( There might be a lot of small losses) 2. Let profits run and multiply them . (Stack trades on winning positions.) The only problem with trading like this is knowing when to exit but that is up to you to find out. Look at this picture-- I was shorting at first but price went up, I closed the trades for like a 20 pips loss but that is nothing compared to the potential gain. Yes, price could turn at any point and that could be a huge loss if I let you run, so you need learn whats your own way of managing risk (moving to BE, closing asap, taking the draw-down etc) I dont have any mechanical method with rules to give away, its all by feel...cant explain Just play with this concept and adapt it to yourself.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
so did you enter once the 1st M5 candle had closed under the 34 SMA? and was your sL above the SMA?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Its a great way of trading and, if you read the thread, there are many who trade this method and are successful - i guess that it works for them and few get on this thread to chat about it now....

Mike, Great system, excellent presentation. I'll give it a whirl! In reading the latter part of the thread I was reminded of the definition of a horse designed by a committee which bore a remarkable resemblance to a camel. It also reminded me of a party game where you whisper something in the ear of the person sitting next to you and it goes around the circle and it is remarkable what the person on the other side of you whispers in your ear when it has come around to you. Thanks for the intel!

Hi Blam, which EA version do you use? And the setting? Thank you

--- 帖子 #635 ---
v3.5 from post1, not gselid12 version (which i tried but it didn't take trades) pretty much default on h4 charts, im using 0.1 lot main trade 0.05 lot secondary trades, on a £3,000 demo account. has tripled account in 1 year

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Hi there, Amazing results - what pair(s) if I may ask, and any indications of your max DD? Thanks in advance, PC

--- 帖子 #637 ---
currently h4 charts GBPJPY, USDCAD, AUDUSD, USDJPY plus some indices , UK100, NAS100, US500 at one point there was a spike in some indices and pairs few months back and equity skyrocketed. had i closed manually account would not have been tripled in a year but more than quadrupled. however, i left the EA alone to do its thing and the equity spike was not all locked in. had it been live i would have closed out such a large positive floating gain for profit

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Nice to hear your experience and thanks a lot Blam!! let me see on my account then.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
too high lotsizes for your account. also this EA will go through some drawdown trades, it is a trend following EA after all. but the profit trades will run and it wins big. but you need patience. i have my demo running for one year fully now, account is tripled.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Dreamliner... I totally believe in this HFT System that you have presented. It takes an individual who understands how any business is run to fully grasp it. What you have clearly presented boils down to that. Which is..., in any business there are overheads. Some are somewhat fixed within parameters and minimised so that the eventual returns reflect a healthy bottom line. I do know, as I've owned and operated several businesses of differing industries. Each of these, I am trying to lower my overheads or keep it at a minimal but nonetheless they are there whether customers come or not! And when time to reap the peak seasons I ensure I max it out. So..., your analogy of the basics of flying/rocket take-off and catching the Jetstream of wind is just so WOW! A lightbulb moment. It's obvious that there will be non-believers and that's why only 5% end up as HUGE profitable next level Pro Traders. My only hope is that you stick around and CONTINUE passing along that vast wealth of knowledge to believers like me/us . There's just still so much of what you know that has not been shown yet. You just can't go around trying to please everyone and therefore stay true to what your earlier intentions were i.e. sharing sincerely something that you know so well that works. After all, this is your thread. You do as please and shun those whom you see unworthy of your time ya. Unfortunately that's how it is with so much ego measuring testosterone hurling sessions in a forum type format of this nature. I believe you are still lurking around from time to time and if it's not too much trouble..., hook me up. I really would love you to be my mentor and understudy with you. I do know you are still contributing on another thread but my hopes is for you to keep this awesome thread alive as your system really makes absolute sense and it DOES work. I've been trading it exactly following your 2 cardinal rules Thanks again for the unselfish gesture. Cheers

best idea to trade . 50k to 1/2 million demo account. i will try it with 1,500 real money any idea to improve this system? "My subsequent entries, however, have no initial stop loss (if uncomfortable with this, you can always place a stop), and will be closed upon either of two conditions being met: First, if the market closes above the SMA I will close this trade. Second, I wait for the market to move in my favor a small amount (sometimes as little as 10 pips, depending on the market) and then place a stop loss at breakeven plus cost (spread). Since I start my trading day at 5:00 PM Pacific Time I do this manually as the market moves before I go to bed. But I’m sure there are EAs that would assist you with this if needed. This means that these subsequent entries have no chance of taking the entire trade into a loss (remember, we have a position on at the beginning of the trend that is in profit), a medium chance of running with the trend clear to the end, and a larger chance of just breaking even. In other words, there is no risk to adding on positions like this, and a chance for a large reward. No risk, large reward trading is what we like.

all rules per dreamliners posts.Dreamliner only gives the 34 SMA. Do you have any idea to make it better,when enter ,add ,st,tp or exit your trades?

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hi ! I don't know if there is still people following this thread but I thought I would add my grain of salt and how I plan to use his method ; I follow exactly what the HFT method tells BUT I added some more features. I trade every pair (max of 5-6 at a time) on the 4h chart. 1 - I look at the direction of the Weekly TF and every PRIMARY trades that will be open in the direction of this Weekly TF will be kept open, even if the price crosses the 34 MA. Why ? Because I do want to profit from longer moves. When the Weekly time frame will change direction (according to me and the PA) I'll sell every PRIMARY trade and change my bias. So if i kept every PRIMARY short trades for some weeks/months and then, it shows me a double bottow (for example), I'll close them all and have a bullish bias. Of course, the PRIMARY trades taken against the Weekly trend will be close at the cross of the 34 MA, along with every secondary trades. 2 - I found out that even if this method works LIKE A CHARM, what reduce most of my profit were the last secondary trades that was taken BEFORE the MA cross. Example : https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZ1Uf6eg/ This is the last trend on GBPUSD (A nice pair for this method BTW). As you can see, you would have been taken out at BE on alot of positions, but this is inevitable. What hurts the most is the last added on trades. They can reduce your profit by ALOT. So, my mesure to reduce those losses is realy simple ; Support and resistance zones . When price reach a level of interest (zone) that I have previously determinated, I simply stop adding secondary trades. It is that simple. This way, I might prevent me to profit to the max when the trends are good BUT I too prevent myself from ALOT of unnecessary lost. I am not too much conservative with my zones. In general, I will put them at more or less 200 pips fro,m my initial entry, but it really depends. Example : https://www.tradingview.com/x/HavcGDkL/ 3- My last loss prevention technic is pretty simple. I simply dont add any more secondary trades when a double bottow/top is forming. Of course, sometimes it prevents to capitalize some gain but prevention is better than cure. 4 - My lot size always follow my account : If i have a 500$ account, I'll us 500u for the primary trade and 250u for the secondary and it scales out the more I make money. You can ask me any questions that you have. I'll do an update every now and then. Thx ! EDIT : correction

Hi Traders! instead of using 34 MA im using the following smart and dynamic indicator for moving average for this strategy.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Thanks for sharing. What time frame you are using? How long you trade it? How is your results?

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hello Everyone, So our pilot say, if "price moves opposite the expected direction, buy more"; Ok, but what if price keep going in the wrong direction? How many more stop losses are you going to risk? This is the equivalent in trading as to "averaging down" (buy more share of a stock going down), which has blown a lot of trader's accounts. I want to ask the OP this question: what was his total loss in case the market kept going in the opposite direction. thanks

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hi ! OP won't answer your question. I think He left. It is simple, you need to determine by yourself WHEN to stop adding secondary trades AND, to protect your capital, having your SL at BE + 2pips when you can. This way, when price is heading to the MA cross, you won't lose that much. You can for example, stop adding when price is doing double bottom/top or when you see that it starts to have momentum. But remember, you'll have made SO MUCH pips having bought at the start of the trend that the few losses at the end won't put you in negative.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hi all, i read this post and the post of Millipede estrategy, they are similar. My result at the moment are not good, but i strongly believe that this is the way I'm going to make a lot of money. I have to be better in my entrys and risk control. Thanks all for sharing. Millipede https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=245149

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hi vgv8 ! I too feel that the risk control is the hardest part. I'm trying to add sup/res as a tool to restrict my losses. We know that the farthest a position is taken before crossing the MA, the more costy it is (when closed). So I came with this idea : I will not add when price is at a recent res/supp and wait to see its reaction at the nearest swing. Example : https://www.tradingview.com/x/VUzBeEcQ/ Ok let me explain : 1 .I plan my Support and resistance (depending if long or short) before adding my primary trade. It is like a plan, I need to know what i'll do and won't do. 2. I'll add until it touched my ploted area, then wait to see if it breaks it or not. I will stop to add when it is at the area. 2.1 If it breaks it, I'll continue to add until the next zone. 2.2 If it does not break it, I'll wait for the price to go down to the previous swing and wait to see if it is rejecting it or no. If I see big momentum candles, I WILL NOT ADD. If price shows rejection with wicks, I WILL ADD. 3. If price reject the zone, it is more likely that it will continue in your direction. 4 . Repeat until cross I am open to any advice. Thank you !

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Thank you very much for the suggestions I will take as a reference to make a flight plan in each trend. I have 2 questions: 1- Now, when you go in trend and add positions, where do you place the SL or do not do it? and wait to see what happens with the bounce? I ask because adding positions to the trend is my biggest problem, it always ends up executing the SL or the BE. And then 99% of the time if one is in trend, it retakes the desired trend. My solution has been not to place SL, the problem is the enormous risk that this entails. 2- To establish the zones, do you use Fibonacci or only supports and resistances?

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hi vgv, 1- Now, when you go in trend and add positions, where do you place the SL or do not do it? and wait to see what happens with the bounce? I would say that it is work in progress but like DreamLiner stated, it is important to let breath the first trades taken . So the earlier I'm on the ''flight'' the more flexible I will be with my SL at BE +2. I might add them after a break of a zone. But, when the ''flight'' is be going on since alot of time and I see more consolidatino and less mmentum, I would add them faster. 2- To establish the zones, do you use Fibonacci or only supports and resistances? The good old support/ resistance easy to determine zone. Of course I know that sometime I will be wrong about those but they are not definitive. If i'am not sure for example, which zone price will reject if there are two zones that are really close to each other, I will wait for price action to show me which one (with wicks of rejection or momentum candle)

--- 帖子 #672 ---
hello, i dont see any tp or sl in the trades executed...is there any tp or sl in existence?thanks

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hi! Like OP explained, to put or not a SL is really of personal choice. I personaly do when price have moved 20-25 pips away from my secondary entries. The problem with this approch is that you'll likely be close out more than not and it can reduce your profit by alot. In the other hand, it is a good way to protect yourself when it is not trending like it should. As for the TP, there is none. You should close every remaining positions when price CLOSE below/above (depending if uptrend or downtrend) the 34 MA. This method is really simple when you think about it. It is all about, as mentionned, linear smal losses and exponential profit. When price is not trending you have to accept the drawdown but when it is, indeed, trending, you'll be super profitable. A+

Hey, Sorry for reaching you this way, my acc doesn't have a pm option yet, since it's few hours old.. I've been reading this thread and run on your posts, and since my budget is low ($250), I'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind.. Did you try Dreamliners method as a newbie, or did you have experience before it?? I like it for being almost the same as pipEasy-s method.. So basically mathematics.. Cut the losses and make profits run for as much as possible.. Now, could you tell me a thing or two to pay attention to when starting?? I read this thread twice, will read once or twice more for sure, don't wanna ask already answered questions, so if I missed something, I apologize.. Thanks in advance to you and everyone else who helped with his/her opinion!!

Hi everyone from Zaragoza (Spain) First of all, thank Dreamliner for sharing their strategy. Also thank all those who have contributed to the improvement of this system, with their suggestions and answering questions from people like me, who do not have much experience in trading. I think I'll do backtesting and share it with everyone, to do my bit. If there is something wrong written, please go to "Google translator", who is to blame for everything. Thanks again and be very happy, despite the pips. Jerónimo.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hi, For a beginner can someone simplify Dreamliners trading method on a down tread for an example. I'm confused on his statement " I take a very simple approach. I add on to my trade whenever there is a candle that closes opposite to the trend. A bull candle in a bear trend is a retracement, and is a reason to sell high (in comparison to what the price just was). A bear candle in a bull trend is a retracement, and is a reason to buy low (in comparison to what the price just was)." So does this mean when you first enter and establish a down trend would you take profit at the first bull candle and repeat? My apologies for this dumb question I've just read this entire forum but still struggling to grasp the actually method.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
COMO ESTAS? the idea worked for you?

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Good Afternoon Traders. After Understanding the idea of Dreamliner's HFT and some features the thread followers give. I did some backtest on EUR/USD H4 from Januari until May 2019. THE MAIN RULES. 1. The same rules Dreamliner gives. (Keep small losses, Let profits run and multiply them) 2. MA 50 (It suits my trading style) ( Dreamliner's Version MA 34 ) 3. Lot size 0.1 both initials and add-ons 4. SL previous swings. (for add-ons SL on BE) SOME FEATURES I ADOPT : 1. Do not add position if the price is below your previous position (Long). (FOR SHORT VICE VERSA) 2. Draw Resistance (LONG) or support at the highest previous trend (or lowest previous trend) 3. EXIT when the close of the candle break the resistance or support ( number 2 ) A FEATURE FROM ME FOR HFT : 1. I Discover PRE-INITIAL POSITION for maximum trend catch 2. This Position catch the trend from the high point after long trend before the Candle cross the MA (Maximum Trend Catch) MORE AT NEXT POST. Happy Trading Everyone. And Special Thanks For Dreamliners and all The Thread Followers.

Hello all, Just thought I'd throw an idea out there regarding this trading "method", or whatever you would like to call it. Most of the posts I've seen in this thread are concerned about enter strategies and how to avoid the inevitable drawdown. I am a novice trader, but have been scourging the internet looking for potential trading methods. I ran across the thread by PipEasy called "Building an Equity Millipede" as some of you mentioned on here. Read all 350 pages because it was that interesting. This thread gives off that same buzz. From my perspective both OP's are telling the same story. Let your winner's run and go with the flow. Below is an entry strategy that combines what I have learned from both threads and might be useful to someone. - Use 4H timeframe to recognize the trend and provide hindsight. - During the retracement (opposite color candle as trend) zoom in to lower time frame (1H, 30M, 5M) and look for signs of weakened momentum. There are many strategies people use to spot this. Flying Buddha, Price Action, Descending/Ascending wick pattern, Pinbar. - Enter when momentum starts to turn back towards trend on lower time frame. While doing this continually consult the higher time frame to make sure you're on the right track. I think this will give your entry the best possible chance to land on the wick of the candle, which is also the safest spot on a retracement candle. This should help keep your positions "legs" alive longer and lower the amount of stop loss necessary since you're placing the entry at a further point away from the trend. Hope this helps someone out there! Just trying to share some thoughts. Happy trading, Beef

I'm About 2 weeks since understanding this idea and made some experiments. And yeah, i've found other good features as improvement for this methode. THE SAME RULES AS DREAMLINER'S and some Features i adopt from this thread followers This is the latest trend from EUR/USD H4 Timeframe. I havent given this feature a name but for now i call it "The Take-off Moment" Attached Image (click to enlarge) In That Trend i used 0.1 lot Without SL or close all when candle close above MA Got the profits about $400 Feel free to discuss Cheers

Woul it be possible to do this on lower timeframes ? How to survive sideways markets or range bounds that moves between support and resistance ? Thank You. Best regards

--- 帖子 #687 ---
It is okay to do this on lower timeframe but the rules number 5, take profit is not 50 pips. try doing some research about average trend movement on that Timeframe before the candle cross the MA. The way we survive sideways market is still like Dreamliner said. "Accept small losses" This is the latest sideways market on EUR/USD H4 worth 285 pips losses Attached Image (click to enlarge) And this is a Good Trend after the sideways worth 425 pips Profit Attached Image (click to enlarge) As we can see, one good trend can eliminate a long sideways market Feel Free to Discuss Cheers

--- 帖子 #688 ---
in post 54 the risk is only 12 pips explaining the chart in post 53 how is this possible on a 4h chart i dont get it and also if the addons start moving against one surely one must lose more ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #689 ---
It IS possible. Look, the idea is not the 12 pips risk. Dreamliner said he put his stoploss at the last swing which is in that trend was 12 pips away. And he also said one of the two things we should be cautious is when “ The distance between the entry point and the previous swing low is very large." For example when a last swing of a trend has over 100 pips away. So, when you find a trend with a swing of 25 pips what would you do? On post 58. Abokwaik said that for re-entries Note about re-entries : · They should never be at a price better than our last entry. · Example : If we are in an up-trend, our next buy should never be at a price lower that our last re-entry. I have tried this with TOM on a backtest, and it reduced the loss in sideways markets like 10%. But it also reduced profit on good trends like almost 80%. So, my personal choice is I enter add ons at every opposite candles and accept all the losses. For now, the best way i know to reduce the losses is from post 685. Rules #1 : What is the best MA applied to - 34 SMA applied to close Rules #5 : Set the target pips on average trend volumes (can be just 30 pips or more than 100 pips, different every pair)

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Hi GearZero, Can I ask : Did you try live this strategy? How did it go if you did? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Yes thank you. I was meaning is the total possible loss for that trade 12 pips, with other words the initial risk and stop from first trade ? In you strategy you have more risk and better chance for profit ? Would an entry on every candle regardless if it is in direction of trend or not be aless profitable ideear ? Instead of emas woult it be more profitable to use marketstructure for trend higher highs ans soon ? How small trends can you use this on 1minute chart and 30 pips ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #692 ---
As far as I can see, your MA is a Triangular MA (34) which is available with ctrader. You can do the same with MT4 if you set the attached tma to 67. Attached File(s) TriangularMA.mq4 3 KB | 519 downloads

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Thanks for the attachment. I'll try that soon. And check if there any updates for the rules. Hi, Giedrius Yes, i've tried this strategy from April 2019 with real account. and anything before them is just a backtest. Hi, jgadefelth I think if you go with M1 chart and 30 pips TP thats too much, but still depend on your trading pairs and Yes, i've tried that market structures higher high and lower low, it works. But the problem was When to exit? and when the price comes back to the MA? because some add ons would be losses when the price comes back to the MA. I would like to ask you to do some backtesting for that, and find the average trend volumes on M1 chart. I've tried some alternatives rules on EUR/USD backtesting. let's see if someone discover something new. Feel Free to Discuss Cheers

--- 帖子 #694 ---
If you go for market structure higher highs and so on you dont need ema. You can find something else as an entry trigger. Why is 30 pips to mutch for the 1 minute ? Why EU it is a hard pair to trade not so mith smooth trends as one would wish, maybe a g psir like gu or gj is better ? Also one must calculate the addons so the MMis good better then 1:1 is to prefer for the latest addons. I like this way of thinking to elaborate on. Thank You. Best regards

--- 帖子 #695 ---
And also this thread have some idéers how the trades can be managed. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=551541

--- 帖子 #696 ---
where's the risk about 12 pips? The strategy tells about no stoploss.. if the trend change your risk reward will be not 1/448.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Yes, finally someone got it. Dreamliner did not say about 12 pips risk. He was telling about that trend he explained. Which means IT IS NOT A RULE of HFT. Hi jgadefelth. Why EU? I said it is a personal choice. You want to take GU, its okay. You use market structures with no MA, and using entry trigger based on supports resistances. Thats the basic idea of trading. I got it. I trade no indicator too. But... If you omitting the MA, is it still considered as HFT system? As we know, the system is using MA and other followers add some features to it.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
the strategy in theory should not be bad. the problem is the long horizontal trends that have been occurring for some years now. have you tried for a period of time?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Long horizontal trends? There was many good trends I've done backtest with HFT and its new features from 2017 and have tried on real account from april 2019. This is the best and easiest strategy i know so far. The result is a good average 200 pips per month with 30 pips TP for me. Feel free to discuss Cheers

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Thanks for your strategy, I believe it your TP method will make it easier to trade choppy markets. May I ask what is the method to find your average trend volume?

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Yes, Supreme1394 the method i use to find an average trend volume is simple. check all the highest points or lowest points of all trends after they cross the MA. and you decide how much your TP is. I'll give an example below : Attached Image (click to enlarge) As we can see, there is some big trend up to 400 pips and a sideway market with just about 20 pips from here, you decide your TP and calculate the risk For example: Option A : we place our TP at 150 pips at every trend, the risk is we lose small pips at sideway market Option B : we place our TP at 20 pips at every trend, the risk is we would miss some long good trends Or we can place the TP between them to maximize profits. So, we should do a research about the average trend of the pair we want to trade. This can be done in any timeframe you like. Feel Free to Discuss Cheers

Hi there, I have been trying to learn different ideas (which is part of my continuous learning) from lot of great teachers in this website. Few of them have been kind enough to mentor me privately, few quite rightly refused due to lack of time. But if there is one method which kept giving me profits is HFT and cant thank Dreamliner enough for it. Consistency is key, I played around with different timeframes, H4 is most profitable and balances the time we need for other stuff in life. what worked for me is to keep portion size at 0.02 no matter what at each entry (due to nature of my deposit), and having stop loss at previous swing high (even for repeated entries), and bite the bullet during choppy market and be consistent. This is a great strategy, trust me guys.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I agree it's a great system, am still running a demo using the EA that was created for it, which did well initially (am unable to trade this manually on h4 due to work). But i think the EA has some bugs which prevent it from being consistently profitable - the principles are pretty simple, so if someone could create a bug-free version or patch the existing EA would be amazing blam

--- 帖子 #709 ---
hi blam, I had very mixed results for shooting for every pair on H4 everytime it cross 34SMA, so I take direction from D1, look for pivots for direction (to an extent) and then wait for my H4 signal..so far so good..fingers crossed,dont want to jinx it. you could use the EA to manage trades once you decide on a pair..i think. not a fan of EA as I've not made profits of it,consistantly. But it might work for you..

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I am really glad I stumbled onto this thread due to your comment 2 days ago! could you say that you continued making those profits like you did when you first started 4 years ago? And is it fair to say that some months will be good and some not so good? I havnt back tested it yet to see. Can you share on the correlating pairs that you dont trade and what you do trade? I have read all Dreamliner and your post But can you explain how you currently trade the HFT method. Your commented to Blam is it about how to trade HFT with the ea or how you trade HFT manually currently ,, just asking for some clarity.. or are you still following the original rules that took your account from 500 to 2500 in 3 or 4 months, 4 years ago. The markets have been nuts lately due to the corona pandemic. Your comment suggests above that you will take this thread further? And yes I would like to thank Dreamliner also and you too for posting !!! Looking Forward to learn this method of trading.

Hi there I stick to Dreamliners strategy, no variations except I don’t get in for every h4 cross over of every pair I don’t do gbpjpy, gbpusd as they are too volatile for my liking. I only try one jpy pair whichever has better chance (based on relative strength) also I keep lot sizes small enough not to make me lose sleep- which I think plays a big part in sticking to this system. somedays you see it trends we’ll only to see it all wiped away next day and changes direction again - can make you crazy, but trust me dance to music and you’ll sooner or later you’ll become an expert think there is a lot in how one reacts to losses and especially watching good gains go negative and trying to switch strategy or bring variation to method biggest take away is “be consistent” - wait for those day(s) which gets you biggest gains. Even if you’ve had 8 losses, 9th will recoup all losses and you’ll end up in profit - provided you stick to simple rules - don’t try be over smart to vary the rules Also remember dreamliner with gratitude for sharing the idea. Hope he is safe and all well

Hi. I dont use that setting anymore as i have found a good consistency. Anyway, it was 34 TMA and some combinations of price action for entries.

Hi Dear What time frame you trade 34TMA, and how many pips SL ?

--- 帖子 #716 ---
"Hi Dear" implies a form of endearment i.e an expression you would use when addressing a loved one,what you meant to say was "Hi there".

Hi and thanks for all your valuable insight into your expeiences with the HFT method. I'm interested to try it out, but there are a couple of points I'm a bit unsure on. The first is your entry- are you getting in the moment the price crosses the 34SMA, or are you waiting for the candle to close? Also I noticed your more recent posts allude to a .02 lot size, are you doing that for initial entry as well as subsequent pullbacks?

Somebody still trading this method? Any notes?

It's a good method, but I think the EA that was made for it had bugs. If those could be ironed out, it would be a profitable auto trading system blam

This thread brings so much knowledge. It is a pitty that it has died because of non-working EA. And somebody still trading it manually, or at least, using principles mentioned here in the thread?

EURJPY going down. I use different technique for addons, but logic of the thread remains intact. Keep riding trends.

Hi all, I hope you are all well! Is anyone still trading this strategy? I just read the thread and it sound very promising! Cheers Nick

Guys, I am using MT5 and am developer of EA's, just for personal use, not a seller of EA's. I know techniques used to do that. If you have Ideas closer to this strategy Edge, I don't mind building EA and sharing, something to learn for all of us. To achieve "Page 1 - Page 3" instructions it took me few hours. It is that simple. I didn't include trailing or BE, so I don't expect it to work well yet. Well I know that absolute Edge of the Strategy should be kept in secret, but for some strategies the market is just too big. This back-test was done under TESLA.NAS 15M. On EUR/USD the basic method just doesn't work, the basic method works only in strongly trending markets. I am looking in tho this now, while trying to keep it simple and stupid.

On some videos on youtube you can read that none of the brokers nowadays allow HFT trading or not n the UIK, EU , could some users here confirm that is true? And If you use this HFT EA which brokers you can recommend?

don't confuse High Frequency Trading (HFT) with this threads title - totally different thing. HFT., at least was, many, many trades in minutes, FR was a problem also - Front Running - bad practices used by people in high finance places

thanks for correcting me.

Look at this EA (Turn on visualization) This is a real HFT strategy

--- 帖子 #442 ---
1. Pick 5 markets that are moving/atr is increasing for what ever time frame your trading. non correlated. 2. Place a horizontal line near price. buy above, sell below. 3. size each trade 1/200ths of account size (most the people here are trading WAY to big). 4. Have a take profit (i do 10%) and move your lines/check for other moving markets. 5. turn your brain off and expect every trade to be a loser, until the outlier comes.
