Hello Forex Factory Members!

This is my first thread on Forex Factory so I will try to make it a good one.

FIRST AN FOREMOST: Let me just thank Mr Remon Reffat for giving a lot of us invaluable insight on his very unique strategy on grid trading.

Without Mr Remon's thread, I would not have thought about the method of trading I have implemented in my newly created EA. Let me please give credit where credit is due and identify where Remon's ideas have influenced me and take similarity in my strategy. The strategy involves taking BUY & SELL positions at the same time for each grid step. The strategy involves closing positions both profitable and non-profitable at a net profit during periods of retracement Without these two ideas, I would not have been able to work on what is indeed a bit of a strategy that mimics Mr Remon's but with a new twist.

Although some of the alternative "Remon EAs" as being discussed in his thread, I thought it would not be fair to do this as it indeed does not represent nor comes close to the method 1 (part 1 and/or part2) of Mr Remon nor does it follow his method 2 which is still under development.

For those who have no clue what I am talking about, I invite you to go visit his thread. The man is a genius when it comes to his grid trading strategy. It is something I have not come across in my 10+ years of trading forex.

Please visit http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=583322 IT IS WELL WORTH IT!

PLEASE FIND THE ATTACHED EA

The settings are explained in this post's screenshot and are pretty self explanatory but feel free to ask if you are uncertain.

In essence, I have already said what the EA does.The strategy involves taking BUY & SELL positions at the same time for each grid step. The strategy involves closing positions both profitable and non-profitable at a net profit during periods of retracement However there are numerous developments that have lead to how I got there and this is why my EA is already called v4

Variables to take in consideration.Round numbers set the grid size in terms of price value. (Please see screenshot for an exampled explanation) Variable take profit of positions Although grid size is very important when trading, I have added a variable TP position in pips.

This I found useful and especially with my favourite pair running my EA the GBPJPY. I added this one based on one of my ideas of taking profits at the middle of the grid rather than when a new grid position opens. Main point to this was to give the Price Action of the pair a chance to turn around should it have reached an ultimate top or bottom.

Example: In a 200 pip grid, TP can be taken at 100 pips either side. If PA swings up 100 pips and down 100 pips from an open BUY/SELL position, then we have closed both positions returning equity to your bank balance for both positions that were opened.

Another experiment that I have done with TP is to set TP at 300 pips on a 200 pip grid. Although this keeps positions open all the time, bigger profits take place and closure is still possible by manually adjusting the EA settings whilst still in trade.

At the moment I have the variable profit position 10 pips away from the next grid step in order to take maximum profit when price is trending and also 10 pips away to allow another BUY/SELL position as if set to 200, one of the BUY/SELL positions will not open at the next grid step.

I GUESS THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT!

Have fun with my new EA. I am not a coder. I have made this EA through a program called fxdreema. I like this piece of software! It is very versatile and can carry quite complex coding with it's graphical user interface that acts like a flow chart. I encourage anybody to try it. I am still on the free version but it hasn't limited me to make my EA. Feel free to discuss not only the pairs and settings you use with it, but also I am willing to make modifications to the EA IF IT'S WITHIN MY CAPABILITIES.

I am not sharing the mq4 publicly but feel free to PM me your request and what sort of modification you are thinking about. I am likely going to say yes in sharing the mq4 but I rather know what you would like to do in order to prevent lurkers from downloading and not sharing their ideas with us and this thread.

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

VERSION 4-1:

All works the same as version 4 (original).
Added Features:
Triple Trade Hours Filter (Default settings will leave this running 24 hours a day with the exception of between 23:59 - 00:00)

(Sorry, this is the only way I can program the trade hours. 1 minute a day it won't take trades.)

(Also you can change from server time to local time by replacing the word "server" with "local")

I am currently struggling with the "Close All Trades at Equity %" - HOPEFULLY SOON TO COME!

EDIT 22/04/2016

After consideration, I have decided to add the mq4 files for further development. I ask you, "Please share your developments on this thread." It is already hard enough to be an fx trader that I appeal to you decency to share with all of us what could be potentially a better EA than I have originally created.

EDIT 02/05/2016

At the request of a thread follower, this version now has a trade days as well as a trade hours filter. I got rid of the triple trade hours filter as it seems users have no use for it. Also, I have made this version a little more user friendly with the inputs. The variable constants are more defined for users to understand and as well I have managed to change the round numbers function to work in pips rather than price as per original v4 and v4-1 which eliminates complications for users and there is no need to refer to the screenshot in this post unless you are still using v4 or v4-1.

For all who use fxdreema, the mq4 files should be able to be imported directly for fxdreema block editing.

Happy Pipping!

Congratulations Friend for the initiative.

I do not know if I should say something, but always think EA should have a direção..por so I have a proposal.

SMA 34 for H1

or

EMA 240 for M15

What TF should leave?

A green hug and pips for all

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thanks Daniel for the time you put into this project.

I look forward to testing the EA from tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I'm not really into MAs so I am not clued up enough to have an opinion of what to use.

I can try to make a modification for actions based on MA but I need to know what you would like the MA to do in the conditions you are proposing.

Is it that you want it to stop taking BUY/SELLS or is it that you want it to take only buys above and sells below... or something else?

As mentioned in post 1, I am limited as I am not a coder and also the free version of fxdreema is limited to how many connection to blocks I have but I am happy to try anything. At the moment I got a lot of spare time

Daniel

Thanks for your support!

Great initiative Daniel!

Let's test it and improve it!

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I'm looking forward to ideas as there are some bits I have managed to do with the EA that takes care of most of the DD issues but it still poses the same or problems that nobody seems to have solved yet which is what to do in a trend? With trend brings DD to open opposite positions.

I am thinking already to maybe stop BUY/SELLS at trendline breaks and re-enter retracement positions on a 3-level semafor indicator.

One must come at a point where they admit their limits and call on the people to humble myself to new ideas for the better of us all!

--- 帖子 #8 ---
EA would take the direction just above or below the SMA 34 (H1) or EMA 240 (M15)

The configuration of your EA can be with the same rules, but the EA would have a definite direction in the first inning.

Note> The EA also had no entries, it is that so?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Great initiative keyduck !

I'm following you with great interest, as well as Mr Remon of course.

I'm going to sleep but will come back soon

Good to see some people from Remon's thread here !

--- 帖子 #10 ---
The EA itself is set to trade at price steps. That is where it enters.

For example. If the GBPUSD is at price level of 1.4133 and you set your grid "round numbers" at 0.0050 (every 50 pips), then that is when it will enter the trade. I don't think you will gain advantage of entering a trade above or below any MA at TFs. Reason I say this is that the first trade is a BUY/SELL. It is an instant hedge and will do whatever it does whether it goes up or down from that point.

If the trades that are being taken are to be only directional, then yes, I could introduce an MA and program it to only take buys above the MA until it retraces and then it would take on sell positions. I could make an EA that does this... but the issue you would be getting is that when BUY onlys make a top, it would be harder to kill of any existing sells that are at the very bottom.

I say this not that you would know but when you see it in action, you can notice that all BUYs in the upward position TP as a trend is happening. Currently, it will always leave a trail of SELLs at grid size until it reaches a top. Leaving only 1 buy/sell at a top, as it goes down in retracement it will add an extra sell position to the existing one in retracement WITHOUT it' corresponding buy. This has worked brilliantly in retracements as they are much smaller than a trend and need an extra kick to kill off the losers at the bottom.

When you say "take the direction", do you mean that you would want it to only take 1 direction trade above or below the MA until retracement?

Cheers!

Daniel

Cheers JB!

I've been working on this for a short while but never found anything to satisfy me enough to share and collaborate with until now.

I like the idea of getting all our minds together and coming up with something good!

I don't mind if we come up with too many EAs on this thread in the process of development. Anything that is worthy in the process, I will update post 1 so that it clear to everyone who joins the thread that the post 1 EAs are the best of the best so newbies don't need to be confused in asking "Which EA should I use?"

I hope in the future that we can have a small handful with diverse strategies so people can use the one that suits them the most.

I'm off to bed soon too... it's getting late and my eyes and head have been in the direction of my laptop for a wee too long!

Hello all here

Thank to open new idea about Remon strategy to whom we owe his idea. I am open here to be a tester. Carneiro has a lot of experience in direction of the trend so will be good if we can implement after his ideas in that EA to be tested.

Jose

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hello, anybody test this EA?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
OK,

1) What TP use?

2) Not yet opened any position, I'm a little confused ...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
The TP can be set relative to the size of your grid.

What pair are you testing on?

What size of grid do you want to use?

TP can be variable. In my opinion there a 4 ways to do this depending on how you want to trade.

1. You can trade TP at mid point of grid. If your grid is 100 pips, you can TP at 50 pips allowing 50 pips away from the next pending position in case the pair turns around, you can avoid being hedged. Also, this can close your BUY/SELL open position quickly keeping equity less exposed for what is being opened.

2. You can go longer and stay in continuous trade. With the same example of 100 pip grid, you can set your TP more than 100 pips say 150 pips. That way you are riding the trend and taking benefit of the direction of PA hoping that better profits come in the trend. The downside is you are leaving a position always open.

3. You can trade to price. By setting the TP equal to your grid. This one here will react differently as instead of opening a BUY/SELL position at the next grid step, it may only open 1 position opposite to the trend due to the programming of the EA.

4. You can set your TP 10 pips away so that positions may not be always open and if you are watching the screen, you can shut off your EA when all positions are closed at some point when it happens. (Example, TP 90 pips on a 100 pip grid.)

As for not opening a trade, I really need to know your pair and round numbers. It will only start a trade when your first round number hits. Even a 10 pip grid will only open when the round number hits.

Sorry I had to program in round numbers, it's the only way I could get the EA to do what it does. As per image in post one I will explain more on this.

GBPJPY, EURJPY, USDJPY: Roundnumbers 1.0 is 100 pips, 0.5 is 50 pips 0.1 is 10 pips etc..

GBPUSD, EURUSD, EURGBP, etc etc etc... there are when price format is X.xxxx 0.01 is 100 pips, 0.005 is 50 pips 0.002 is 20 pips etc etc..

I hope this is understandable.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #16 ---
EA will only open an order when you arrive at the round number?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Yes, at the round number setting that you set.

If you are using GBPUSD at 0.0050 round number it will only open at 1.4150 or 1.4200 if price is sitting in the middle of these values for example.

Hi Daniel,

If I was a spritely, withit young fella I would say somthing like, "You da man dude!!!!!"

But as I'm not I will say thanks

Unbelievable ... would ask a question on what time the EA Piggy will match the operations ... see the results ... you're a genius

+ 922 pips and I was with a floating - 163 pips

Very nice carneiro!

What timeframe are you running?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
from what i understand TF doesn't matter for this EA since it work on price levels, right ?

[quote=keydcuk;8871907]Hello Forex Factory Members! This is my first thread on Forex Factory so I will try to make it a good one.

Hi Daniel,

Glad You shared with FF community.

I am happy to start testing Your EA at DE30

let You know results

Carneiro, just curious as to where your buy positions are, I see only sell.. the EA opens both the positions have you forced it to Sell only?

Cheers

Hi keyduck !

Hope your sleep was nice ! I run a lot of different versions of Remon's ea and i had add yours this morning on my personal server.

I wasn't in front of my screen for a long time but i took 3 photos with my iphone before going to work.

So here are my comments:

1. It seems that the ea is doing a great job on GBPJPY. I set the parameters in hardcore mode (Gridsize = 0.02 so 2 pips...) with 0.01 lot. I banked + 30 and DD is around -80 (Demo account of course). I made this choice to watch how this baby goes when the things turns wrong...

But as you can see, i note that time to time the ea open 2 orders at the same time in both directions. I don't know if somebody have the same problem ?

2. An other thing is that the ea don't open orders correctly on non JPY pairs. On USDJPY all the things seems to be ok but on EURUSD, GBPUSD the ea didn't work. I don't understand... there is no error in the "MT4 expert" tab.

On AUDUSD the ea opened 1 order in both direction and...nothing after.

The grid size was set to 0.02 and 0.04 on each pairs.

Sorry for the quality of the screenshot

--- 帖子 #31 ---
You are only hit the TP for buy i think...If the trend goes up again your account will be blown!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
The EA is working for EURUSD .

If you choose 5 pips , you have to input 0,0005 in RoundNumberDistance

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Ok thanks madscalp !

I will fix it asap.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
It is right to open 02 positions up and down

Read post 01

@Carneiro

Got it thanks ! I didn't read the post 15 or too fast last night.

I think it should be in post 1 because a lot of people will ask for the same things... (roundnumbers and decimal).

This jump to number (6) is not important. It was simply that while I was programming that I deleted block 5 while making the EA and the blocks didn't renumber themselves.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I would like to give tips

1) we put the CHECK CURRENT PROFIT unrealized always the approximate value of the pair of ADR within these settings I left with 05 grid.

2) for those who want security in their operations, look at the economic calendar and pick a pair that will not have the currency news on the day, it's a safety filter

Example: Avoid USDCAD when in NY will have news CAD

--- 帖子 #42 ---
The EA opens BUY/SELL position for every grid step, takes profit when you set it in a trend. This is why you can be exposed to a number or opposite trades on their own or with 1 BUY/SELL position left on either end of the grid. The it will keep doing this till retracement phase takes place, it will double up on what it is retracing until it sees your TP level by summing up all the cash value and converting it into "x"pips. Once the pip profit is achieved, it will close the sum of all retracement positions together at "x" pips.

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

keydcuk, congratulations on the great job ... I would like to make a suggestion ...

CLOSE THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL TRADES

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi JB,

I can't really answer your double up question as I would have to get better screenshots or see this thing running live because of the tight grid you have used. However, your case of not trading I think has to do with your round numbers. For the EURUSD and GBPUSD 0.02 and 0.04 is 200 pips and 400 pips away from the next step respectively.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #45 ---
See table I made to post 37

0.02 and 0.04 for USD pairs and other seguinifica this one 200 pips and 400 pips grid ,,, will only open new positions when you arrive at this point ... you whether you want to place grid 02 pips and 04 pips USD pair to have to be:

GRADE 02 pips = 0.0002

grade 04 pips = 0.0004

I hope it helps

--- 帖子 #46 ---
There is no way this would survive the GBPJPY on a 5 pips grid. That's just mental!  It's not a miracle EA.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Friends deactivated the EA, to stop making money ,,, kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

see my results

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I think the issue has always been the same. I have said it in Remon's thread before. In grid trading you need wide grid steps to survive. Of all the Remon EAs I have tested from 2013 to present, I have discovered that with the best found settings and hitting a wall of bad Price Action on uncommon occasions it still causes DD of about £2500 or a bit more, I forget the actual results.

So far with my EA, after bad years of end 2013 and into 2014... DD was about £700. I think I would comfortably trade this EA 0.01 per £1000 but I am not suggesting this as I present disclaimer that I hold no responsibility for these suggested settings! LOL

Daniel

@Carneiro and Daniel

Thanks for your help ! Now i understand

I set the ea on DAX30 with a crazy grid (0.2 pips lol) just to watch the battle between the sell/buy until it crash...or not^^

I do this to think about a solution for a happy ending when a trend without retracement occurs.

Maybe a good idea is to input a timer in the ea. I think it's safe for us to use it only during the night in europe on EURUSD (for example)... Low volatility, without a trend direction is a good way to protect our capital. We can also increase the lot size if we want more profit.

Just an idea... i think it worth to do it, just for test. I'm not a coder but this function shouldn't be too hard to create

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I would totally agree with your comment about news!

If you pay attention to the calendar and actually stop running the EA on high impact news times, even if it means a loss, you will save yourself from possibly getting heavily DDed and also with less positions open should there be a PA spike on news. It can take days to close the retracement positions and if the EA was closed before the spike and opened again like an hour after news, you would probably be able to take in more traded pips in profit than having to wait for a retracement move close.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #53 ---
This is an easy scenario to do if your grid is wide enough and you are taking profit at the median of the grid.

Your suggestion though, do you want it the EA to disable once it has closed all positions? I have thought about this and it might be easy enough to do.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Remon,

Thank you for taking interest. I attach what I have found so far to be my best settings with the GBPJPY. I know it is a volatile pair but other than the GBPAUD, the GBPJPY seems to retrace a lot more so this EA is more dependant on retracement.

Many Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I was thinking about the trend problem with your ea daniel...

I don't know if you are following the development of remon's part 2 (not exactly the same) but steve hopwood have made this ea... It is not finished yet but this give you an idea of how we can play with the trend and a grid.

I'm running the ea (an older version) since the beginning of the last week and the results are good. But it should be managing manually because it doesn't close the trades. I put it on 4 pairs and my max DD was -150. I close when my equity balance is +30/40 depending of the trend on the pairs who have the most orders.

The only problem is when the pairs are ranging with a wide size between a high/low. If you have 40 sell, this could be difficult for the buy side to reach a global positive equity when the pair is trending up.

For instance, i don't want to pollute your thread with many ea, here it is.

If M. Hopwood want me to remove the ea from here, i will. If Daniel want too, i will.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
amazing !!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks Carnerio for settings,,

My worry is how this EA behave in heavy trend...might have to risk the whole account ? my result as of now

--- 帖子 #58 ---
to close all trades , you could enter first :

extern bool STOP=false;

then

if(STOP==true)
{
CloseOrders(magic);
}

and

int CloseOrders(int magic)
{
int total=OrdersTotal();
for (int cnt=total-1;cnt>=0;cnt--)
{
OrderSelect(cnt,SELECT_BY_POS,MODE_TRADES);
if(OrderMagicNumber()==magic)
{
int type=OrderType();
bool result=false;
switch(type)
{
case OP_BUY : result=OrderClose(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(),MODE_BID),5,Lime);
break;
case OP_SELL : result=OrderClose(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(),MODE_ASK),5,Red);
break;

}
if(result==false)
{
Alert("Order ",OrderTicket()," failed to close. Error:",GetLastError());

}
}
}
return(0);
}

sorry I cannot do better coz no mq4

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Don't worry about discussion of other people's work and/or attaching their EAs or information. This is not a competition or an ego contest. I am following all developments of Mr Remon as well as EA coders such as Steve Hopwood, however I was was slightly offended when YET AGAIN he has deleted my post. I wanted to get as much input as possible but Steve even PMed me to say that I can't post ex4s on his site because I wasn't on his A list. I'm not convinced he would have kept the post even if I did post the mq4.

Fighting the trend is the hardest thing to think about with this strategy. It is hard to get indicators involved as then you aren't really gridding and you may as well say that you are trading a semi manual method as it enters conditions to trade.

This is more of a case of man with computer against PA forex wave. Can we program something that will beat all PA conditions with software? It will never be perfect but in my eyes it is all about "How close can we get a program to trade 0.01 without loss or near no loss with as little DD as possible?" So far, I think it is around the £1500 region. This is not good enough. This is why improvements need to be made and humbling yourself to knowing you can't do it alone is the best way forward.

As for your discussion of equity (or DD), I think the key is to have as few positions open as possible and to have them closed as quick as possible. This is why I think that closing the opposing retracement side is crucial so that trends can keep taking profits. Trends happen more than retracement so if we focus on profitable trends and DEFCOM1 solutions to get rid of retracement poistions by closing them quickly, I think we will be closer to something that can beat most of all market conditions.

Steve has deleted a post....very curious

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hello Daniel

I will post after the results with eurgbp in 2k account with Carneiro settings. I saw your post was deleted in Steve forum as one of mine, but no problem with it. I don't know coding but I would like to include in your EA the option to use trend direction with HGI strategy. I have been watching the HGI Matrix some days in a row and looking at the chart and I found trading HGI 4h when has yellow wave or blue wave plus any directional arrow ( can be rad or trend or range ) in the same direction of waves line up with LTF like 30m and 15m with same combination wave we got strong move. So the idea is to implement HGI inside if possible from you .

Regards

Jose

I don't think it would be right to post his PM on here but just to quote you one line of it, he said "You can't do this." (Referring to my post and EA in ex4)

I so felt like replying to him "I just did." Heh...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
This segment has to be different,,, people start trazeerr many ideas that are not part of the method. try to understand.

The idea is to find a pair that oscillate ... so I said not to operate on the day we have a coin with news,,, we can leave several tamplates ready for every occasion.

The idea of closing everything and EA get off, it would be when I got a value ($) or (%) or (pips) accumulated with the difference of floating.

Example:

in box = $ 100

Floating = - $ 80

with a 1k case has put the device (CLOSE ALL ORDERS 4%) when the cash difference with the float was $ 40 (100 -60) would close all positions and EA would shut down, returning to work only if the operator activates.

ALSO PUT A TOTAL LOSS OF FLOATING DIFFERENCE WITH CHEST ... CAN PUT A LIMIT OF 10% FOR EXAMPLE

ATTENTION

Those who want more security in their operations, work with the EURGBP pair ... with post settings 41

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Believe me, I have thought about the HGI indicator in both Remon's strategy and also in mine. Unfortunately I would not be able to implement this for 2 main reasons.

1. The HGI indicator is one that expires after a period of time and should the indicator's expiry date not be renewed, it would kill my EA and I would have to revert to older methods of this EA. It is important that the EA stays in development without HGI because if we went to HGI, there would be no development made in the principle methods of how my EA trades.

2. MORE IMPORTANT: HGI indicator is exclusive to the SHF website and it has been expressed not to have it used outside the SHF forum.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
As mentioned yesterday in Remon's thread the following method might worth some consideration for dealing with strong trends:

The "Envelopes" indicator might be a good choice. (Of course, parameters should be fine tuned).

Using the below "rough" example, the EA would have added SELL-AFTER-SELL trades today below the channel (without any BUY) until all previously opened BUY trades had been compensated with some profit (or at BE) when the EA would have closed ALL open trades.

After that new BUY/SELL trades would be opened only within the "sweet spot" of the EA, i.e. within the channel.

In summary: the EA would make most profits within the channel, going into "escape mode" - with trend direction trades - outside of the channel, and so - in case of a sudden major market move - it could get out of all trades even with some profit. Attached Image

Masterguru: you're absolutely right with this idea and it's simple to implement in the ea of Daniel.

I had already support you for this in remon's thread. Unfortunately i'm not a coder myself :/

The ea of daniel works very well... On a virtual unlimited amount of money, this strategy always works even with a tiny gridsize. Our main goal is to avoid big DD and moreover to have a DD we can assume and manage on a real account.

@Daniel: I didn't saw your post on SH forum... He has been deleted faster than the speed of light lol

It's sad because i'm sure some people could help the team even if they are not on the famous A list ! Hopefully it's not the same here

THIS becomes the complicated part! At the moment, the EA only manages sells with sells and buys with buys. It does not take a scenario when the buy positions exceed in profit a particular sell position. There is something in one of my previous versions of PnTM EA that might be able to work for this as one of my previous versions did not take profit the same way and left gaps of buys and sells depending on PA.

Give me a few days on this one and I might come up with something by next week!

At least here at FF, it is so commercial that moderators don't pay attention to all the threads that go on. And even if they did, they don't have any Hitler attitude for what gets posted and what doesn't unless you are generally out of line.

At least here, nearly  the only one that can kick me out of this thread is me! Heh heh.

This segment is going to the same place of others ... we did not test for 24 hours and are already wanting to change a lot of things,,, has to enteder,,, we have to put a limit gain and loss in the EA and ready. If we know where the direction is going with indicators we do not need EA, just make the entries manually because we know the direction.

The idea of this monitoring is to test the exhaustion of pairs, you see,, testing with a volatile pair like GJ.

1) 24 hours

2) with a short grid (eg 05 pips)

3) without trend

If we work the most volatile pair ... of course we will make a profit in less volatile, but for that we must test. Let's put different pairs watching the calendar, we put different grids,. ,,

If you continue the way it is ... in a little EA is like a Frankenstein and nobody did the tests

Hello Daniel

Thanks for your answer, I understand you , no problem. As i said attached so far my results in eurgbp with Carneiro settings after 3h19m +1%

thank you a lot, going to test it on several demo accounts

I have noted both your post and MasterGuru's and hopefully I will come up with some minor adjustments next week. Hopefully it will be 2 EAs as I want to keep MasterGuru's idea separate while still discussing the bare bones of the original EA I posted. It should be easy enough to get the EA to stop trading at next profit close. It does happen from time to time but the TP needs to be within the grid steps. Otherwise you would always be in an always open position situation.

Daniel

Honestly, I don't mind doing modifications IF I CAN. But I will only post them inside the thread until we can agree it performs to a standard equally or better than the original (or at least my v4). I will try to keep this nice and tidy so that only thread followers will see new mods inside the thread and worthier versions can be added to post one along with an update to what the modification involves.

If that fails to put a GENERAL closing with the cash difference with the floating,,,

PUTTING A DEVICE THAT CLOSE ALL HAND (FOR ME ALREADY BE VERY GOOD)

If people understood this system,,, I would not ask to put anything,,,

My concern is that I see in other segments, the costruction of the EA for life .... Piggy v1, v2, v3.v200A, V200 B ... and do not stop ... more filters have a lot ... I know you're a good person, but I'm afraid tracking finish without even tested terms.

I can easily include enveloppes option but I need mq4

double envel_up = (1+Deviation/100)*iMA(Symbol(),TimeFrame,MA_Period,0,0,0,0)

double envel_dn = (1-Deviation/100)*iMA(Symbol(),TimeFrame,MA_Period,0,0,0,0)

conditions if price > envel_up ....only buy
if price < envel_dn ....only sell

Dear Daniel

Thanks for your EA, I very appreciate your effort. I already started testing it today on GBPUSD.

Idea of taking profit when price on retracement and clear all floating trades is such brilliant and its quite natural.

I mean this because EA is not depend to Envelopes, MA or other filters.

EA open all hedges trade when price on the move (trend), and it could stabilised the equity.

Hi to all. I'm new on this site and would like also to test this EA, but I have a problem...I don't know why the EA don't wont to start. I put it on the chart and the face is smiling and STATUS is "working", but nothing happen, no open trades for long time. So any idea where is the problem?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
First, you are working on which pair?

See Table 37 post check if your partner is with JPY or another pair

See the post 22 model for JPY pairs

see post 37 model for the rest of the pairs, but note that the profit lock Limit EURGBP is lower because it has low ADR

NOTE: friends have to understand that the EA will only activate in round numbers. In models left, as the grid is 05 to 05 pips,,, will be then that EA will be activated. If round number is far will take to enable EA to why the market at that time is stopped.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
At the moment, I will make sure that my next version has a stop mechanism involved. I will try to have this sorted out for next week.

I have developed my own EA and only found it worthy enough to post when I got to v4. I hope there will not be versions in triple digits LOL!

I've got big plans for the next level of this EA and although it will not be using the HGI indicator, let me tell you for your own personal sneak peak and insight on this, the methods behind the HGI indicator are not so secret as they seem. I am hoping to use the same methodology that generates HGI signals into this gridding EA. Tighten the grid in range, widen the grid in trends, drop the buy/sell position opens and only buy or only sell.

I think this is all possible but don't expect it to be anytime soon. I am organizing something in the background and it could be a while and maybe a few months rather than weeks, I genuinely don't know! But I think it will be big. Most EAs only work well in ranging or in trend. I hope we reach a level where it can do both. I sincerely believe this is possible. We have more than enough brain power together to do it!

It's all about the sharing and we will win!

...motivational speech over...

Sorry, I can't explain this comment. I have not personally programmed it to leave any comments. Very peculiar!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I'll be honest with you, I don't think that any pair will survive any scenario that is less that 100 pip grid as the EA stands other than maybe the exception of the EURGBP. I have not explored this pair at all and have lost interest even in Remon's thread.

In further development and as previous posts, there might be a scenario in ranging periods that will handle smaller pip grids. I still encourage people to test what they feel like testing as what I haven't tried, maybe someone else will find out something I never would have expected.

My opinion other than this is that if you want to trade a tight grid, maybe there will be success in the Asia Session? The EA is well capable of performing a clean sweep of trades leaving none open. Once we implement a stop trading function and a trade hours option, tighter grids might be successful. It will all be soon to come.

Thanks for your collaboration

Daniel

Hmmm, that sound very interesting, if you can share the method to get the same as HGI will be more welcome sir

Jose

--- 帖子 #85 ---
A lot of it can be found by just reading up on the HGI. If you actually read HGI thread from beginning to end, Nanningbob talks a lot about certain things. This is not my only source. I can't really share the other at the moment because I feel it is a bit unethical but yeah, read all about HGI direct from the source at SHF, 240MA, 60MA, Standard Deviation, Slope, etc... I'm not saying I got the precise code for it but anything is achievable when you know where to look and you are willing to put the work needed behind it!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Friends as I said before I like the simple things ... I do not think we need indicator,,, just look candles,,, I had given a tip a while back there on the topic remon, about just an observation,, let's see:

The 1st candle D1 that changes direction, we enter the 2nd candle ... see the chart and you will see that hardly fly away When D1 changes direction, we have the following sailing in the same direction. Look at the picture, and its other peers graphics.

Just an observation

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thank you daniel, i will investigate more.

@Carneiro: I already saw your idea in the remon's thread. I was really interested about this way to learn the market... have you tested your idea ?

You mean BUY only when the previous candle turns GREEN and SELL only when previous candle turns RED...?

If i'm right, we can backtested your idea... I suggest to add a Stop emergency if the market goes in the wrong direction, maybe 7-8% of the equity balance ?

Maybe having a Profit% of equity is a good idea too...3-4%...depending on the number of time we statistically reach our stop emergency...

And my final recommendation for this method is to trade only D1 candle as you suggest IF the candle is in the right direction, regarding the W1 previous candle !

What do you think about this Daniel ? I know it's not exactly the way your ea is made for but in MT4 we can select 'only buy/only sell' manually.

I recommend you this link: https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1374

I think it's a nice strategy and for my grid experience Ea must be stopped after first opposite position has taken a profit and after this we start a new cycle.

For example if i've closed one or more buy cycle after the first sell cycle with profit i close all.

For now i'm using a CloseAll script to avoid unpleasant situations and to stop EA when i change the settings.

My settings:

EURUSD Day   0.0005 - 100 - 100 as suggested from 8AM to 22PM max GMT+1

EURUSD Night 0.0004 - 50 - 50 from 23PM to 8AM max GMT+1

--- 帖子 #89 ---
0ver 1000pips so far. This is impressive. I think with equity profit management, this will make profit.

Thanks for your amazing EA and @Carneiro for the settings.

Yes, it seems to be a valid observation for the past 3 weeks.

Is it the same valid for the - statistically more significant - past 3 years...?

Just curious.

I have added this to me "modification toolbox notes". I want you to know I embrace all of your ideas as I do not dismiss that even if I may disagree with some (not talking at all about this one), that I could fall susceptible of overlooking something that could well be genius.

Hi keyduck,

--- 帖子 #93 ---
RIGHT THEN BOYS AND GIRLS!

In the interim of looking at ideas and developing alternatives to my original Piggy n The Middle, I have made a quick modification of my own for all you FORWARD TESTING experimenters. I think this will help further development and especially for those who wish to talk about indicators and what happens in the scenario of certain indicators popping up on your chart.

PLEASE REMEMBER that if you are talking about injecting indicators into the equation that they will likely be TimeFrame sensitive if you are trying to think of ideas of determining trends, pullbacks, ranges and trend reversals.

The modification is simple. I have set flags for true/false BUY/SELL MODE and BUY UP / SELL DOWN MODE.

So that you can understand the possibilities, I will point them out.

1. BUY/SELL MODE - True BUY UP / SELL DOWN MODE - False

This will trade exactly as the original method. Point final.

2. BUY/SELL MODE - False  BUY UP / SELL DOWN MODE - True

This will trade by placing buys only in the up step position and sells only in the down step positions.

3. BUY/SELL MODE - True BUY UP / SELL DOWN MODE - True
Experimenting with weighted positions? This will not only open buy/sells at every grid step up and down but should open an extra buy in the up step of grid levels as well as open an extra sell position in the down step of grid levels. A word of warning, the EA already adds extra positions when touching every grid level on retracement so it could add heavy DD or it might give us better profits and opposing hedges closed quicker. WHO KNOWS? Let's have fun with this!

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

KEYDCUK, the big challenge now will be the management of operations. As I said before, things have to be simple.

When I put an idea, an observation is always thinking of the programmer also the possibility of power or not. See this idea.

For the management of inputs could put to close all operations when he arrived at the limit "X" closed bars, just a possibility.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE SOME COMMENTS.

We want a consistent profit and see some results.

Yesterday put in a U $ 4,781.00 account to test the downdraw together on the same account and GBPJPY EURAUD (not advice to do this in real account), put to test downdraw they are 02 pairs of very high ADR. So far accumulated 12.46% with a current float of 5.75% with the manager at EA was just close everything.

Another very good point for those who want to start with a real account of 1k. placed to run the EURGBP pair, this pair has a low ADR and often fluctuate much during the day ,, this is very good for this system ... it won $ 53 and a floating $ 10 ... that would be 4% profit liquid in an account 1k, not bad. IS THE COUPLE recommend for all to use (EURGBP settings post 41).

A big hug to everyone

Hello Daniel and team,

I very rarely post these days but do enjoy reading grid threads.

I have a time/ price action based EA that I cannot share as it was built for a group of users about 5 years ago. However I feel I can discuss some of the methods used to defeat much of the draw down as they were much of my design in the first place. I am not the programmer (and cannot programme) but I have spent years - literally - thinking about grid systems, like many others.

A few points to consider:

1/ Don't get drawn into using indicators - few will help in the long run as they simply add latency to the grid efficiency

2/ Big grid steps create the best grid structures (you're already onto this)

3/ To work out the best pairs for grid trading I use a little calculation I call the Macro Grid Co-efficient (MGC). I simply take the max high point and the subtract the max low for a pair (assess over ~20 years minimum) this gives me x thousands of pips range, I then divide this figure by the the long term daily ATR.

So, for example, for the NZ/USD it would be about 5000pips macro range/ 90 pip Daily ATR = 56. The lower this figure the better the pair is for grid trading (or at least the way we used to grid trade).

In other words the smaller the macro range relative to the daily volatility gives you the best grid trading pairs. So best pairs will have a reasonably low macro range and a good amount of daily volatility to get through the grid steps.

Ok, so how to defeat the drawdown (DD) in a grid. The big gorilla in the room

Firstly, Remons idea with eliminating the oldest toxic trade is smart and does help the DD however the removal of these toxic trades is swamped by the share number of trades being opened in the wrong direction as a trend develops.

So you must consider not only how to eliminate these but also how to neutralise them over time and price action until they can be eliminated without loss.

For example, instead of opening a buy and sell at each 00 figure why don't you try opening two sells when the price action that moves down to the next 00 (ie a sell trend as your system defines it). When the next step is reached one of the sell trades closes for profit and the other remains open but goes to BE.

Now as the price reverses back up at some point it passes through the grid step above and creates a buy trade and causes the sell there to close since it is at BE. This also triggers the sell located two steps above this to close along with the "dangling" two sells on the bottom step below (ie the lowest point of the grid). These two will therefore neutralise each other out - thus eliminating the bottom sell trades and so removing the toxic trades from the grid. If it pushes on the the next step up then the single buy (which is now at the bottom of the grid) will go to BE and as price moves to the next step up again it will open two buys from this point at each step as it moves up... and follow the process as mentioned above. I hope this makes sense - map it out and you will get it. Make sure the steps are reasonable size between them!!

In this manner you can eliminate the unwanted "dangling" or "toxic" trade, whilst making profit at each step. But you are not opening infinite number of positions if it ranges back and forth over several grid steps (and thereby triggering a new set of trades as your current EA does). It only ever has maximum two buys or two sells at any one time at a grid step.

There are many logic permutations as to what you can do at each step and the trade setup ratio at each grid step that can make a grid EA work beautifully through a big trend and a range market

The power of this approach to a grid means that as the grid trends you have a whole bunch of sell trades at BE for a down trend and these are all in profit (i like to look at them in terms of adding up their total number of profitable grid steps that I can use to remove toxic trades) as the price action pushes lower (and you have more and more extra "grid step profits" to play with) and so you can do many things to eliminate the problem trade at the bottom when the price action moves back up. Even if it is a false reversal you have enough profitable grids steps to clean up the false buy etc.

Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble But I hope this adds to the thinking and development of your EA.

I FORGOT TO ATTACH MY EA! It is now in the previous post.

Please not it IS only fore experimental purposes. In previous versions of my EA, I have tried whether BUY UP ONLY / SELL DOWN ONLY was better than BUY/SELL to each grid step and I concluded that relative to profit and DD that BUY/SELL was the way to go for every step.

I have only introduce the experimental version for those who wish to play with changing the mode along with indicator trading.

I will be honest with you, I am not a big indicator fan at all. I come from a background of mostly trading with Elliott Waves and Fibonacci levels and also a bit of harmonic patterns. It is only my opinion that indicators will not work. However 2 points to make about this.

1. I humble myself that there are traders out there that do successfully trade with indicators and should there be any of you out there, I would hate to have missed the opportunity of presenting an open EA to them to make it trade more successful than it already can.

2. Although I am not sold on the idea of HGBnG EA (SHF members will know what I am talking about), I am quite sold on the possibility of HGI really does a good job at identifying trends and range periods and am willing to take my time in exploring something that will behave similar to HGI and trade grids accordingly.

I don't want to get TOO serious about this and over think several different scenarios but I am here to have a bit of fun.

I will repeat what I have said to a FF member just a short while ago in a PM.

"There will always be at least 2 EAs. There will be the version in which I feel is the best way to move forward, and there will be the version that anybody can play with."

I got a lot of time on my hands at the moment and am a very easy going flexible guy. If I can program something up quickly so that someone gives it a try, I will even if I personally think 100% it won't work. Why? I could be proven wrong. AND If it makes them happy, so be it!

Only serious contender performing EAs will be kept in post 1 and I don't intend to post many as I hope that we will be more focused on improving the ones that are already in the forefront.

You will probably see me do this from time to time repeating myself but "Thank you for participating in this thread!  "

Tim,

I thank you for your post. Your EA seems interesting as I am attracted to your statement of "based on time & price" as I have studied Gann Theory for quite a length of time in my moments of being a successful manual trader.

I have noted this post to my "development toolbox" as I am noting all ideas that I want to reflect on at a later date.

Rambling is ok, I am very guilty of that also. After the ramble I always worry whether I have made my point(s) clear or whether it was a senseless ramble!

Wishing you all the success and thanks again for your contribution. I hope to hear more from you in the future!

Daniel

Hi Oswell,

I understand that Carniro setting will do buy and sell at the same time but your results shows that you have Sell only. I am not sure if I understand this correctly

Best regards

Hi Daniel, I have subscribed to this thread and I'd like to thank you for posting your EA. I ran it last night on GU on a very small live account. I don't recommend trading with such an under-funded account, but I have bouts of insanity every one in a while. I started today's NA session with 693 pips from your EA. So I at least owe you a drink or ten. I am not a big fan of automated trading, but I like it so far. Anyway, thanks again. I also would like to thank Carneiro for posting the settings he used for GBBPUSD. It was very helpful.

I know less than zero about coding, but I only have one suggestion. If you could find a way to choose to to stop the EA from opening new orders but still manage the already open orders as usual (I know you're working on a STOP function) it would be helpful before a news event, avoiding swap fees, getting out before the weekend, etc. I am not a greedy person, so I am not looking for ways to improve performance. I like it the way it is. Thanks again.

I'm not really sure man , I just follow everything and run the EA and this is what I get  ,

Personally, I don't know if my mind gets the idea of closing the EA with this strategy. Market moves are market moves whether they happen day or night. I currently don't think there is anything worth looking at in my ideas of this EA because of the way I want the EA to trade. However, I am contemplating whether there is something about trading really tight grids in the Asia Session!

In anyway, this is not about me. I keep and am truly to my word. Whether I agree or disagree on ideas, I am willing to make modifications to experimental purposes. I might learn that something I would have never expected might work. It already seems that closing positions in a day might be successful but my opinion is that you cannot predict the day that market will have a long trending day or a news spike.

Here is a quickly cooked up version of what you would like to see for closing all trades. It is a timer based on however many days/hours/minutes you wish to program it to. In the later version, I do want to put flexibility on shutting down the EA as an option of when all trades are closed or at a maximum loss of "x" in terms of profitable loss and not actual loss. Example, close at 50 pip loss but not 51+ pips.

I think though the best thoughts were when the talk about using the EquitySentry along side with a trading EA.

Hope you have fun with it!

Daniel

This idea is in the works. I just don't know how soon I will get it out as my programming software doesn't seem to have the right conditions in their blocks to do this yet. I might ask the support administrator to help me on this and/or get a coder to help me.

On a side note, someone has generously offered me free lessons on how to code so I will be able to add more versatility in my EA for what I can't do with the EA programming software I use.

Hello Timmy

Good idea to be implemented by Daniel, is very good having the tool finding the best pair to be traded. Maybe the EA can make the calculation based on those criteria and only trade that particular pair this day. Next day do the same closing the order in the pair trading day before.

Hello

This is my test for today.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Dear Daniel

Could you do a favour to add parameter in the setting, the floating limit (let say max USD100), and EA will close all open trades.

In this kind of business there are always the risks. The most important how do we manage it. Either manual or auto-trade.

In my opinion, all EAs (Remon version and yours) feasible for live account trading...

We need to multiply to different pairs simultaneously, so other pairs which gain the profit might cover the cut loss of the day.

And I believe.. not everyday you are in the lost position. At least minimal losses...

We look at the situation today on GBPUSD... where price range goes around 100 (1000) pips W/O retracement (see attachment).

You will know what will happen if the price keep climbing without at least 50% retracement.

This is the most critical part to solve....

With the combination of everyone ideas and discussions here.. I believe we will find the solution.. just matter of when.. keep moving guys.

This is an amazing EA. I will continue to test.

My trades from today,

The first trades was made with another robot that is not working well but with this more of 300 usd dolars!!

Thank you so much!

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I'll have a look at this in due time and try to help you out.

However, let me point out that you will not need 50% retracement to get out. When retracement starts to come down, positions get added in down steps of retracement so long as it has hit another high first. As it comes down, you will have 2 sell positions against the losers until cumulative profit gets converted to a pip value set in your TP and will close all sells. To close a 10 level DD you are probably looking at needing only a 25 - 35% retracement as an approximate guesstimate. I have not done the actual calculation but it certainly will not need to go half way.

I have been approached to have set TP or SL in money value and I am very reluctant to do this. For your own benefit, it is better you work your brain in pips. The reason I say this is simply because a grid is measured in pips and you will get a clearer picture on what you want and/or need when trading an have your mind geared in pip values for this system.

For instance if I have the EA say close at $100 or 100 anything EUR or GBP etc... where does that leave you on the grid? How many positions are you telling the EA to take profit or take stop loss? On a 200 pips step grid, I can say I want a loss of no more than 3000 pips and you will know exactly what that means. It is 5 loted positions that go against you.

Position 5 (the biggest loser) - 1000 pips

Position 4                           - 800 pips

Position 3                           - 600 pips

Position 2                           - 400 pips

Position 1                           - 200 pips

TOTAL                                (-3000 pips) on a 1000 pip move.

If you ware wanting to take a profit, it is better to know where you want the profit to be taken. If I say again $100, where is that on the grid? Does it overstep your grid steps? If so, it's going to leave you in a continuous trade mode as there will always be one more position that opens BUY/SELL before a single BUY or a single SELL takes profit. I have tried this to maximize my profits. So far I have found the best TP position is 10 pips away from the next grid step or to TP at the median which trades with less profit but different scenario for DD and trades left open.

Anyway, ramble ramble, in hope to convince you to think pips rather than money with this system. If you want to know money value, just put it into a pip calculator. I just want you to think smarter so you have more control of what you are doing with this rather than to just think loss or profit of money value.

Just my 2 cents. If you insist that you want to see things in terms of money, I will do this but I do advise against it.

There will be a a close all trades function at a lost option implemented. I hope it will be sooner than later but I need to look at a lot of things to get an update next week with all relevant requests and information gathered by others.

Hi Daniel ,

yesterday i saw a potential problem during a little news, the ea in EURUSD have perfectly closed all buy with a profit and has left all sell trades open but on some biggest news u could have a large jump after you close and this could be potentially dangerous.

I think but it's only my opinion that probably the best thing is to close after the profit reached but waiting the close of the 1MIN candle >95% of candlestick.

What do you think about it ?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
excellent ea. thanks to the creator. my only problem is my broker has max. 100 open trade limit.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Dear All, I have made this simple indi based on Robinho Carneiro daily bar color change observations. I am posting the indicator with code so if anybody want to change it, he can modify the code. The Orange Bars indicates Bearish move and Blue Bars indicate a bullish move. Anyhow the colors can be of your choice by going into colors tab of indicator.

NOTE: I have serious reservations regarding the daily bar change because it will most often led to a false signal. Here i plot my reservations and suggestions.

(i) Most often daily bar color change will occur because of a temporary pause in a strong trend. And next day , the actual trend will resume.

(ii) The daily bar color change does matter but (a) it depends upon where the bar closes. (b) the circumstances under which the daily bar color was changed (c) The price level and time where daily bar changed color (d) The High/Low a daily bar made during that day and where it finally closes and how it closes

(iii) How the daily bar color change is related to Price Action on daily and Support and Resistances.

Since this griding idea is based on selling and buying at the same time therefore, i don't see any logic in "Predetermining" the direction of a particular pair because this is against the spirit of the whole idea. If one can determine the direction then whats the needs of this girding logic? If one can determine direction, then why not simply plot either Buy or Sell pending orders on different price levels.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #120 ---
That was a really interesting post Tim, thanks for that.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Yes I was testing the EA on XM and noticed they have a 148 max open trade rule  so will be trying it on another demo next week.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Just as continuation to my previous post, see the attached EURAUD h4 chart. This is possible to happen on EURAUD next week. Its very possible that It may go Bullish on Monday till Next Day London Open and Then starting a bearish movement. So on Monday we may get a Bullish daily candle. According to Daily Bar color change theory ,Should i trade Long only on Tuesday? I think NOT. Why because it depends that How and where the Monday EURUAD daily will close. But drafting the possible movement next week ease your work.

Almost same is the situation on GBPAUD, GBPJPY,GBPUSD. So as a whole, we can say GBP will go bullish on Monday and then starting a Bearish movement on Tuesday in London.

Whats the point in saying all this?? Leave it as pure griding technique. Please don't involve any indicator , any predication etc. Let it be a pure griding strategy.

Next in which situation this Strategy will perform better? Till now the extensive testing and dedication of Keydcuk and MasterGuru revealed and as a general thought on different forums, griding systems will perform better in Ranging Markets. Now its upto you to find out that where a pair gonna start ranging/consolidation?

Just open the H4 charts of all pairs one by one. Note all those pairs which have recently(week) made a new low or a new high. highlight the previous high/low which was broken. The market will most probably will consolidate between these two points for a good amount of time. Target this region, set a limit that how much pips you want to extract of this region. If you get your target. Then don't be greedy. Take out your pips and run away . Sooner or later the bigger movement is gonna come. If you analyse the 28 pairs, you will most probably find 7 or 8 pairs like this. Thats enough for the week. Next week, new regions, new targets.

New is a bit of a strange thing. It can go in your favour or it can go against you. We all love it if we forgot to close out trades before NFP and all of a sudden we realize that it went in our way and we're up 200 pips. And the other way around, we can pull out hair out (if there is any left) if news goes against.

The thing is, I fully intend to have something to close all trades and also to have a proper time filter for trading hours.

Having said this, the way I trade grids, I am not concerned of news at all. A 200 pip news move can always retrace and if not can close later on in time. What is a 200 pip news spike to me? 1 or 2 extra positions open. It is insignificant in my trading with grids. Maybe one day when my bigger vision of this EA is achieved it will show more concern as I will be looking at something that can adjust grid sizes to market conditions.

Grid trading can actually be a news trader's best friend if you only trade the news event. The only thing you need to be careful is whiplash.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #124 ---
The wider the grid, the less positions open. This should not be a problem You'll be doing yourself a favour for using wide grid anyways, it will bring less DD.

In either way, if your grid size is causing you to open more than 50 trades, I think that you're playing with fire. I can only recommend as well that you study as per Tim's post what the maximum swings have been in history and then you will get an idea of what worse case scenarios could be for having positions open with relation to the size of your grid.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER...

I have brought this point in Remon's thread and for those who have read it, please let this sink in. For those who have not seen it, please pay close attention.

Take Profit is not always the best way to go in the short term. The higher the Take Profit settings, this is the main problem.

Not only is it that your equity is tied up for longer periods of time while waiting for the grid to close a position but while still open, you could have missed several other opportunities to make more of the smaller TP trades. As a hypothetical example, you may have trades only 1 trade with a high TP position when with lower TP you could have taken 3-5 trades in the same period of time.

Take Profit is not linear to DD. This is the most important part of the lesson.

What I show in these 2 screenshots is an example ofa 3 year backtest for a TP of 190 pips on a 200 pip step grid a 3 year backtest for a TP of 100 pips on a 200 pip step grid (median grid trading) ​Now I know some of you don't give much attention to backtesting but please for a moment, put down your prejudices and pretend that this was a live account and that every trade would have been executed the same as if it was live. (I DO STRESS NOT TO USE BACKTESTING WITH THIS FRAME OF MIND), I am only saying this to present you THE IDEA that I am trying to present.

In the first screenshot, the max DD for the 3 year period was 1167.95. You think to yourself, not bad. My 1000 account managed to grow to 2825.59 quite safely. It's not the best profits but it was safe and where else can I nearly triple an account in 3 years stress free?

This is where it is interesting due to the non linear results of lowering TP...

In the second screenshot the max DD for the same 3 year period was 605.62. The end profit result was a 1000 account with an ending balance of 2434.06

Ok, so I would have made about 400 less in a 3 year period with nearly 600 DD.

This shows 2 points

1. A smaller account could have taken profit without blowing the account

2. If you had enough money,

the 190 pip TP would have only bagged you 1825.59 of net profit.

With nearly the same amount of money to invest, you could have traded 2 x 0.01 lot positions and finished the 3 year period with a net profit of 2868.12.

Now you tell me who is and would have taken more profit?

Serious things to consider with not only this trade system but with any trade system.

hello timmy,

read your piece with great interest.......

are you still grid trading and if you are, what kind of return can one expect with the right parameters?

another guy who professed to be trading like that for years, claimed to make around 35% per year.

in this thread Daniel is outlining a ranging grid system, where the profit is made when the trend reverses.

I suppose the NZD/USD pair with the low MGC would make sense trading here.

the grid system in your example is a trending grid system.

I would think that a pair with a low MGC would not make sense trading here, but a pair with wide swings over time.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Keydcuk,

Thank you for sharing this idea and Ea. The Ea works good, I have it backtested. The problem is just like you have been aware of: when pairs is in heavy trend with little retracement. I also agree that we may still survive the heavy trend by using 0.01 lot, increasing grid size, and tightening TP.

What I have not heard before is, regarding the HGI. Could you please brief us a bit, what HGI is capable of and how will it enhance the grid.

I also interested in "Tighten the grid in range, widen the grid in trends, drop the buy/sell position opens and only buy or only sell." Do you mind to share your plan, how will you achieve that ?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi Yonnie,

I am pleased you found my post interesting. I have previously traded grids live for about two years non-stop. The trouble was I did it manually and got tired of it. (It became a bit like dairy cow farming - great money but you had to be there everyday to milk the cows) . And 35% return sounds pretty well right. Maybe 25% in a bad year and ~50% in a good year.

All this talk of making 100% or 200% a year is BS. If you are able to grid that much profit - you will kill off your account - and that's 100% guaranteed for sure. Treat grid trading like a business that gives over time with good management. You make a business successful and it might make you around 40% net profit on AVERAGE per year (ie some years are better and some make less - you have to be in it for a decent period of time). Trading can give you that, and grid trading can be a very good basis to do this.

The great thing about grid trading is that you are using price action only, it is low stress - especially the way I traded them. I never worried about the news as the grid just absorbed it all and moved on. DON'T trade small steps!

In response to your other comments - Daniels grid system is a trending system as it adds sells on a down move and buys on an up move. But as it is designed currently it REQUIRES a range situation to recover its toxic trades from the other side of the move.

One way to help improve the current setup is to use skewered positions i.e. For downward opening positions open a sell for 0.1 lot and the buy trade for 0.01 and for upward opening positions open the buy trade for 0.1 lots and the sell trade for 0.01 lots (you can do this for the EA currently as it is). This will make the losses much smaller for a trend breakout - as the larger trend direction trades add more profit than the cumulative smaller trades on the other side of the trend. And I wouldn't open multiple positions- or at least limit them to several at most open at any one time on a grid step as the price action moves back into a range. Since these can build up and become a major breakout risk.

AND importantly once back into a range I'd allow the bigger trade positions that form in the new range, that are the same direction as the string of small trades that were against the initial trend breakout, to close independently from these string of smaller positions. Hence as profit builds back up in the new range you can eliminate these smaller trend-created 0.01 lot trades with a few good 0.1 lot closes. Hope that makes sense.

We could do this right now with Daniels excellent EA but it would require ongoing manual intervention from time to time as it stands.

I still prefer my trading approach which creates two positions in the same direction (using same entry mechanism as Daniels EA) leaving one to profit as the next step is hit and one to BE. This BE position is never going to be profit even if the market moves away in a strong trend leaving many of these cumulative open positions (and a massive paper profit). They become your ammunition for a smart logic process to eliminate toxic trades from the wrong side of the trend - and they act as "sea anchors" slowing the DD created by any extreme trade(s) remaining from the opposite direction to our new trend). Also when the market ranges (and as long as its not a tiny range) you will do nicely as well. (Also refer to my previous post for some of the process for this grid structure).

All food for thought....

As far as the MGC is concerned - it is irrelevant what the price pattern is like within the macro range. Just because the price has moved in an average trend of 1000 pips for the last 10 years when it has trended does not mean it won't trend for 3000 pips - assuming the macro range is that big. So the lower the MGC the better over the long time game.

cheers

Tim

I think you have misunderstood what this EA does. It takes full potential of both trending and retracement times.

The EA takes profit in the trend and kills all opposing positions in retracement at a determined profit.

This EA can easily do 35% a year.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

Here, I don't want to comment too much on HGI as I will not be using the indicator itself. Having said that quickly, HGI is capable of identifying when there are long trends about to begin and when these periods finish and are about to range. I have

I have not got my head all around this yet but I am exploring the possibilities of automated grid size changing according to market conditions. It will be a slow process with this, if I can implement something like this.

I have been doing development over the weekend to something based on this idea but with no indicators. It is too soon to comment more on this as the programming is a bit complicated for me. I am backtesting what I have come up with so far to see if the methodology is working. It may or may not produce an updated version of my EA, I am not sure at this point.

As far as a plan? It is still in an experimental phase as I don't plan to make numerous updates, only 2 types, significant ones to the original and a few experimentals for mass testing.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I've been meaning to post about some of your thoughts Tim. So far I have tested the idea of adding weighted positions on what is in the trending grid. So far the results are accurate and positive. If I double up on the sells in the downtrend and double up the buys in the uptrend, the DD is lowered more to as my original best settings.

PEOPLE: As far as modifications to this, the EA is already capable of doing this on its own. You can assign the lots traded amount individually. If you look at post 1 you will know which buys and which sells are associated to the uptrend and the downtrend.

Thanks for being here Tim, I think you are and will be a big help for grid trading with this EA.

Best Regards,

Daniel

I'm very new to this grid idea but after reading remon's and your threads, I think I have a fairly good idea of the concept and how it all works. I like it a lot and believe it has great potential. I'm going to be starting testing today but I wanted to comment right away on the trending issue.

Just as above in your thread, MasterGuru and anazri have recommended in remon's thread to use something like envelopes to figure out when the pair starts trending. I know we are all trying to stay away from using indicators but in the end if it helps why not right? The idea is that when it moves out of the envelope you start buying only if going up and selling only when going down and then closing those trades only when we re-enter the channel. I like the idea a lot but the problem I mentioned to them on the other thread is that very often when it moves fairly quickly out of the channel it tends to retrace quite a bit as well before re-entering the channel therefore leaving you with relatively decent size losses on trades that were opened at the top.

My recommendation was to tighten the grid and TP quite a bit while outside the channel and then change them back when we re-enter the it. As we don't know for how long it will keep going up, the idea is to make smaller profits on a lot of short-live trades. We leave profit on the table due to the increase of spread it costs us, but it avoids the risk of bigger losses on bigger retracement.

We know the strategy works well in ranging periods but not so well in trending ones. The idea here is to limit the larger DDs created in the latter ones in order to reduce the risk. I think this idea does just that. Like I said, I'm new to this idea so maybe I am totally wrong. HaHa!

I always speak of D1 sail as work with it, we will need to be on PC only 01 once a day ... and we only work with LIKELY because we are not sure of anything in the forex market. But look at all 28 pairs ,,, many times when we have a change of D1 and the next candle will toward the candle that changed?

Only spoke of changes NCA direction of sailing, because everyone was talking about indicators and bla, bla bla ... if to put the indicator system, I prefer that we follow the D1 candle that changes direction, the more the system is fantastic .

Keydcuk,

I tried to run the ea on a US broker (forex.com), hoping that the hedging rule wouldn't stop it, but alas, it did. So I downloaded a demo from Tallinex (non-US broker that allows US residents). The ea won't run in the strategy tester. Do you think it could be because of the suffix in the pairs (EURUSDecn), for example?

Thanks for any help you can offer. I would really like to run this exciting ea and just looking for a way to do it.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
At the moment, this version is just experimental. It is for those who wish to make the EA only buy up and sell down without opening the buy/sell.

If 1 is set to TRUE and 2 is set to FALSE, then it should trade like the original EA is post 1. If you want to activate in active trading the BUY up SELL down only then set 1 to FALSE and 2 to TRUE. My original post had mentioned that there is a 3rd setting to put both 1 & 2 to TRUE is you wanted to double your up and sell position accordingly but I have noticed in backtest that this does not function properly. You would be better to increase lot sizes rather than mess around with putting both input 1 & 2 to true.

It has been a difficult weekend because I struggle to get the EA to change modes on its own. I have tried to experiment to where one wants to drop the BUY/SELL position and go buy only and sell only in cases of where there are too many positions open. So far it has been unsuccessful but I have had a few distractions over the weekend so maybe with a fresh head tomorrow I will see clearer.

Happy Pipping for Next Week!

The first EA has always been fine as far as I am aware.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I actually have a Tallinex account as well as a Global Prime and I have had no problems backtesting in the Tallinex demo account. I suspect that you need to look at your round numbers and get the correct settings for the pair you are using. It does work with EURUSDecn.

Round numbers have already been explained but see below for EURUSD.

0.001 = 10 pip steps

0.005 = 50 pip steos

0.01 = 100 pip steps

0.02 = 200 pip steps

The default settings are for the GBPJPY which is different. Please read the thread and understand how the round numbers function work.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

Thanks! I'll go back and do that.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Version v4 is the STABLE version. Everything else is experimental.

You do not need to play with the experimental versions if you don't want to, it just helps in the continual development of strategizing to find ways of fighting issues of high trends without retracement and lowering DD.

Hey keydcuk, you close all the positions in friday or leave all the weekend?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I think it is not advisable to leave it all the weekend. My account demo account blown because I left it all weekend and the gap on the chart today wipe the account. Now I start testing with a new account.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Haha! Grid based strategies have always done pretty bad over weekends. I'd advise you to close all your trades on friday afternoon or use a time filter.

I did the same mistake with my current EA's and went crazy as I saw this morning's DD.. But went through

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Daniel

Thanks for your thread, I have not read remon's thread but I have read yours. I was wondering how people here are dealing with open trades as their balance and increases, but the equity decreases.

Thanks

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Personally because of the large gird size I use and the way it recovers losing trades, I leave it 24/5 but some people are finding value to close all trades. It would be worth looking at your trade method & grid size before making this decision. Carneiro seems to trade it slightly different. It is worth looking at how he does it. As for me, I have a specific method to focus on first, then I might look at what Carneiro is doing with the EA.

Cheers!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I am very satisfied at the moment the way the EA recovers positions. There are only few times where there is heavy DD and that is in trend with little retracement. My preferable pair at the moment is the GBPJPY as even though there is a lot of volatility I believe it retraces more that most pairs.

I will be releasing an update with a balance/equity close all option but it is difficult to program at the moment due to the nature of the EA.

I hope to have something this week to play with.

Thanks,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hey Daniel,

thanks a lot for your work. I've read both threads and I am really interested in making it a profitable strategy.The old settings gave me a loss. (The ones with 0.05 round number distance on GBPJPY) So I have changed it up. Let's see how this week goes.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
My current settings for the GBPJPY is 2.0 with a TP of 100. Round numbers of 1.0 will bring larger DD. I have not tried the 1.5 yet but am looking at something in the way the EA takes count of the TP pips. I might have come up with a solution to get a bit more money banked. I should know my results by the end of today as I am running a 3 year backtest at tick at the moment.

Cheers!

floating loss $472.16

big losses are pending sell order, trend going up without big retracement

--- 帖子 #158 ---
i had similar, but the a large drop in GBPJPY price occurred and closed out many orders for  proft. this is the advantage of the GBPJPY pair and its large price swings

so far first day of demo testing using Carneiro settings is showing healthy profit

The forex operator behaves the same way manually and with the ROBOT

WE HAVE TO TEST FOR DAYS ... NOT TAKE PROFITS OPINION OF JUST TESTING DAYS 03,04.

LEFT AND THE DIRECT WITHOUT CLOSE ON FRIDAY, to know what HAPPEN ... AS I SAID, WE DO AGGRESSIVE FORM OF TESTS.

PUT SETTINGS DIFFERENT THAT PUT,,, BUT LET ROTATE, EU IS EVEN LOSING, AS A SETTING MAY LOSE 01 DAY, AND VRMOS AFTER SETTING IS A GOOD ... WE WILL TEST FRIENDS ... BUT IN MY PERSONAL OPINION .. SEE WHAT TO PUT ON A RELA ACCOUNT,,, I would work ONLY WITH EURGBP

Hi Daniel,

I noticed that you have only Sell open transactions in your TICKMILL account without buy, I did not see any opened buy from yesterday. Any reason for that?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I don't have a tickmill account. If you are referring to your tickmill account, I don't know what conditions have brought this. The EA opens buy/sell at each level. There is no condition with the EA yet that opens only buy and only sell unless you are using version 4aa and have manually set it this way.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
My forward test in 3 days so far on on demo account, Depo 1000, Pair GBPUSD.

So far it looks good as no trending move. I still want to see on trending move.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Ok thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Thank you for your reply Daniel.

I guess, given that my computer is on for 4-5 hours a day, I dont get to see the EA recover that well, and when I turn back on again, I see a big draw down from the previous day, perhaps I need to close orders overnight.....or I am not using optimal settings....or I have too many pairs open.

Will have to keep playing with it.

Thanks again

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #165 ---
By what you have said above, if you turn off your computer, the EA will not work. Maybe this is why you are experiencing problems?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I thought that may be the case.

Tonight, the EA has been running for approx 6-7 hours, and it has been given me the best balance to equity results so far.

I will have to think of a creative way to get around this issue.

Thanks

Ezzy

Today is the day to test the EA. Monday was not a suitable day. The market opened with so wider gaps.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
It is definitely 2.0 for the GBPJPY pair. Please note that it will not open trade until it hits the round number. It does not take trade immediately.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hello Anazri

Assuming another move again you for 150 pips more, maybe you will be around -15%, not bad for straight move of 330 pips. In my opinion those settings in that pair are doing good so far

Jose

--- 帖子 #185 ---
$1000 is quite low for such system which does not limit amount of open trades. I would suggest minimum of $3,000 and recommended amount of probably $10,000 (also depends on leverage) because there will be periods of very large drawdown assuming no manual intervention.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
No wonders here. You are using a 5 pips grid! With this pair I only use 150 pip grid and safer is using a 200 pip grid.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Not that I've tried this pair but I think these will probably be the right settings for the GBPUSD.

hello Tim,

thank you for your reply to my questions, appreciate it.

I have my own gridding system, but yours works better in tight ranging conditions.

did a test on AUD/NZD and NZD/USD and have a few questions........

for the 1 month period 19/3 - 18/4 2015 NZD/USD the best results were for a 70 pip grid.

is that about the grid size you would use?

macro range relative to the daily volatility: don't understand why this has any bearing on the choice of the pair to trade the grid.

we don't know what the trading range in the coming year would be.

if anything I would think that the best pair would be the smallest grid size compared to the daily ATR.

if a sell trend reverses and creates the first buy order, you exit the 2 dangling sell trades with the profitable sell trade 2 steps above.

if there is none, exit 1 dangling sell trade with the profitable sell trade 1 step above?

would you recommend closing the other dangling sell trade at a loss?

is there a disadvantage of closing all toxic trades at a loss if no profitable trades are available?

in a strong trend, you leave the profitable trades open with large paper profits to close out future toxic trades.

now you get a strong trend the other way with hardly any toxic trades - wouldn`t your paper profits go up in smoke?

is there a reason why not to cash in all the profits when a trend reverses and just accept the losses of the danglers when no profitable trades are present?

do you have any more tips you are able to share?

thanks Tim.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I think setting a daily equity target is the best option. Today 1,000pips, I think that is not bad for a day.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hahaha! Well done! It will be in the next revision. Just got a bit more testing to do and I will upload a new version with a few tweaks.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
All thanks to you for the amazing EA.  I look forward to the update. I will keep testing.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Finally, getting out after 200 pips from 1000 to 1400++ and ending with 27 bucks.

A great test...

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Another option that I think should be in your next update is a start time. To make the EA not to continue opening trades after the equity profit has caused all open trades to close.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
These 1000 pips profit can not be right ... must be the profit difference with the floating, you may close 1000 pips and the floating be negative (- 1200)

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Already ahead of you.  I have programmed a triple input for trading hours so that your can tell the EA to trade three times during the day.

I thought it would be useful if you wanted to trade in between sessions.

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #197 ---
This addition will be based on PURE EQUITY. It would be senseless to make it any other way.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
My suggestion is to have a function for ProfitTarget, like 10€, which means that close all trades and start with new cycle when the Equity reach the value of StartBalance of the cycle + 10€. For me this is the best way how tho reset all and be more safe.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Only warning and willing to help ... much peace in the heart

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Cheers Carneiro!  I appreciated your participation this this thread.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I close all trades when I noticed my account equity has reached the setting i have for the day. I only close this particular trade at total pips of 1000pips and the equity profit was 613.6pips and the floating and commission is 392.8pips.

This is another account I started after the first account, I set equity to just 200pips for this account. As at when I close the total pips is 369.7pips I closed at 213.5pips with float and commission at 156.2pips.

The main point is running all day may not be too safe as market condition and news changes all the time. Having a daily target at which you make profit and stop trading I think is the right thing.

Cheers

Hi Yonnie,

Some answers for your points:

-         "I have my own gridding system, but yours works better in tight ranging conditions. did a test on AUD/NZD and NZD/USD and have a few questions........ for the 1 month period 19/3 - 18/4 2015 NZD/USD the best results were for a 70 pip grid. is that about the grid size you would use?"

Yes this is a good number for those pairs.  But over time as the daily ATR changes you can increase the grid step with it - this too can be built into the EA.

-          "macro range relative to the daily volatility: don't understand why this has any bearing on the choice of the pair to trade the grid. we don't know what the trading range in the coming year would be. if anything I would think that the best pair would be the smallest grid size compared to the daily ATR."

It is not really relevant to this thread and is more in line with BWILC stuff - just my macro grid take on it.  I worked this stuff around the fact that we have an extreme high and extreme low as known facts for a pair and that they were very unlikely to be breached for long periods of time.   And so build a grid system within these boundaries.  Not for this thread.

-         " if a sell trend reverses and creates the first buy order, you exit the 2 dangling sell trades with the profitable sell trade 2 steps above. if there is none, exit 1 dangling sell trade with the profitable sell trade 1 step above? would you recommend closing the other dangling sell trade at a loss? is there a disadvantage of closing all toxic trades at a loss if no profitable trades are available?"

Ok, this is hard for me to explain but I'll try.

Firstly you need to map it out on paper - there will no longer be sell trades above if price reverses direction - see my rules (one sell will have already closed for profit and the other is at BE which will be killed off as the PA comes up through the grid step).  So you will be left with two stranded sell trades on the bottom step in your example ... at this point.  Here is how to get rid of these without the grid losing any step profits.

So to continue your example using the "dual trade system": lets say as you mentioned you start your grid on downward moving PA and it created a Sell, Sell (SS) at step1 and then moved on down to step0 - it would first open two new sell positions here and close out one of the sell trades from step1 and move the other to BE.  So now if PA moves back up and breaches step1 it will open two buys (BB), as it moves on  up further it will now close a buy as it reaches a new step and move the other trade to BE.  So at every point the grid is closing regular trades for profit.  But now you start to see your equity line track south of your balance- because of the toxic sell trades at the bottom of the grid. But as it moves more steps up the equity line will slowly reverse and, if enough steps are breached in the buy direction (for this example) then it will neutralise the toxic trades completely.  In fact under this example you would only have to move three steps upward to neutralise one of the bottom sell trades or both will be neutralised together after 5 steps up.  So you can now use a systematised logic approach to eliminate these toxic positions based on what the PA does.

Of course, the price may reverse again before it gets up to step5 and so you have the over-layed logic of the "asymmetric" close process to take care of these opportunities (see point 2 below)

----------

There are four ways your equity can catch up with your balance in a grid system - and this is ALWAYS what we are after.

1/  that you close out the grid - and who is going to do this when it is churning out the pips and in good profit - so you either force-close your grid (eg EOD, or news event), in which case you may be caught in a loss or a profit  - or you're going to use this "method" when you're in the pooh and deep in a drawdown.  Aaaahhh - but I hear some say that they will close their grid at 1000 pips profit at the end of a day - all good but what if this is not reached and it gets to 993 pips - and then disappears into a five week DD.  So this is a weak tool and not the best idea unless you can figure out some way of consistently close out when the grid is in profit using a system.

2/  That you have a close mechanism for trades against the (short or long term) trend.  Daniels EA addresses this to a good degree (with a trade cluster profit target which is also independent for the buys side and sell side) - and is why it is a good EA to build from. this mechanism will certainly help close out toxic trades. (I call this an "asymmetrical" close mechanism - there are a number of ways of making these very efficient)

3/  Directional bias - this helps by producing more profits on the 'price' side of the grid.  Again Daniels EA has this option and I think the mechanism with trade direction based on whether PA moves up or down to a grid step is a nice simple and smart way of getting this directional bias without all the use of lagging indicators (although you can use some of these also - but I reckon PA is the best)

4/  Elimination of toxic trades in a trend.  I use the concept of the "Dual Trade System" logic (as explained above) to achieve this.

With a smart trade bias approach and a good asymmetric close process that allows independent buy and sell closes and the ability to close our toxic trades - you will do well for long periods of time.  But really without a specific toxic trade elimination capability when the price action moves into the inevitable big trend - you are merely "shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic" and your account will blow up at some point.

Try back testing your setup on the Euro/USD for the period May 2014 to March 2015. .....  Maybe you got stuck in a trend like this at the beginning just because your setup couldn't make it to that 1000 pips for the day and only got to 993 before going into a rapid initial DD and you figured that's ok it'll climb out of it.  Well, you could always make your target 500 pips for the day - with your fresh new account.

-          "in a strong trend, you leave the profitable trades open with large paper profits to close out future toxic trades. now you get a strong trend the other way with hardly any toxic trades - wouldn't your paper profits go up in smoke? is there a reason why not to cash in all the profits when a trend reverses and just accept the losses of the danglers when no profitable trades are present? do you have any more tips you are able to share?"

Because when do you know the trend has truly reversed - YOU DON"T.  So them's the breaks - the dual trade is not part of the profit - never.  So forget about it.  It's your ticket to a permanent grid system that is stress free - hopefully.  It's a business when you get to this point.  I am just a retail trader like everyone else here but I have traded my main account at over $400K USD at times -  and you can't do that with the chance of hitting that iceberg.

Sorry for another ramble!

Tim

Are you by any chance a very aggressive set?

I already said before, but with my 500$ demo account it almost blew up when I had round number at like 0.005 instead of the preset 2.0 . Which was already very aggressive. However 6000$!? You must run a very aggressive set.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
No, my settings in GJ is the settings of Carneiro shares.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Keydcuk can you share your settings to GJ please?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
The settings that Carneiro have given are for the EURGBP pair.

Because round numbers are not the same on all pairs, this is why they did not work for the GBPJPY. I will repeat this so you know.

JPY pairs

0.01 = 10 pips

0.05 = 50 pips

1.0  = 100 pips

MOST other pairs

0.001 = 10 pips

0.005 = 50 pips

0.01   = 100 pips

My recommended settings are to use 2.0 for round numbers and a TP of 100 or 190.

The TP of 100 will give your less profit long term but it will carry less DD. The TP 190 will give you slightly better profit but more DD.

In a previous post, I shown 3 year backtests of of both scenarios and that if the lower DD option was chosen, you could trade more lots and overall make more money this way. Currently as it stands, at TP 100, the best DD is around 600, that is 600GBP. I am currently testing a revised EA to hopefully get this even lower.

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

This week the market is trending so hard. avoid such situations. You need to exploit the EA in better situations and its not difficult to find favorable situations. This week on Monday London, The market is so trending. Pairs moving without any considerable retrace. Testing gridding EAs in such situations is not a good decision. You will have to spot out better timing to test, better pairs and better locations to test. You can't apply gridding set and forget. Wish you best of luck.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Seems to me that EU/GBP would be ideal for this as it typically retraces quite a bit.  I am testing it.

--- 帖子 #213 ---

Bigger Pardon Sir, We are in Strong Trending days since Monday London. Trending is very bad environment for gridding techniques. I got a 300% gain on my real account this Monday but lost all because of dis-connectivity to brokers servers and i very hardly managed to close the trades on B.E . No worries. Hopefully, I will do it again. This is all part of this game. Days will come when you will be wining big. But the important thing is to not loose the heart my brother.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I AM MENTALLY BANGING MY HEAD HERE!

Sorry, I just needed to say that...

I have added Piggy n The Middle v4-1 to post 1.

1. I was going to wait till I get version 5 out with a slightly new way of trading that was going to shave the DD a little compared to the original version but things have been very inconclusive and I have tried so many different combinations of tests I am almost at wits end but still have a couple things to try.

2. In v 4-1 and/or v5 was/is going to have a close all trades at equity gains % but the software I am programming with is currently restricting me of programming it as a fixed value and not as a variable for you guys and gals to set. I am currently trying to get a fix for this. Bare with me, hopefully it is coming soon.

SOoo.. all I got so far is a bit of a headache but a triple Trade Hours Filter.

As edited in post 1, this is default set to trade 3 periods of 00:00 - 23:59. You will have to deal with trades not taking place for 1 minute of the day. Hopefully there will be no opportunities. Sorry, there is no work around for this. It is simply how the EA block works. (Rubbish!)

I am trying my best people. I am not a coder but have undertaken to make the EA that is available. I have been approached by a few coders but none of them could confirm to me 3 simple things that I have asked before I share the mq4 file.

1. That you have a concrete idea before I share the file so that "their" idea gets filtered through me to ensure we all get this idea and that nobody runs off without thread followers to have the information.

2. That the mq4 file does not get shared.

3. That the mq4 file gets passed back to me when modified.

Am I asking too much here? Are my ideas too far fetched to ensure we all get the best of any idea and/or modification that comes or gets done?

Or am I just being too overcautious and paranoid? I don't know. Anybody tell me...

Anyway, thanks for your interest and support in this project.

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

Hello Anazri,

Thank you for sharing your test results.

Would you please advise what round number are you inputting for 150 Pips in case broker is 5 digits and suppose current price is 1.43000?

I inputted 0.0015 but not sure if it is correct. when you saying 150 pips i think you mean 150 points which is 15 pips. Correct?

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
4 or 5 digit broker as the 5th digit would only be a "0" at the end. 150 pips non-JPY should be 0.015

--- 帖子 #220 ---
hello Tim,

thanks for your reply.......

to get any confusion out of the way: am not convinced yet that the ea proposed here will work for me. it is not a ranging or trending way of trading the grid, but a mixture with buy/sell orders triggered above and below price.

a pure ranging method will only have limit orders and a trending method only stop orders.

the biggest headache for ranging and mixed grids are the trends.

at the moment I rather go with a trending way of trading the grid while trying to minimize losses in ranging conditions.

luckily keydcuk in post 60 doesn`t mind discussions about other people`s work and at the same time people here might learn something from your experience of trading grids for more than 2 years.

for me it is trading grids manually, not with an ea and only with stop orders above and below price.

that`s why I`m interested in your way of trading.

will get to your last reply later Tim.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hello,

I´m agree. Reach the profit day and stop.

But, this is the point....

When to enter in the market to reach your profit day?

What to look? Day bar? some other indicator?

This is the big task for us...

--- 帖子 #222 ---
That will be a great IDEA, let's see if anybody can make a reversal EA just for curiosity

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Yep - stop orders are the order of the day.  I also prefer a trending grid.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thanks Keydcuk,

Then 200 pips for GJ and 3 digits is 0.2. Correct?

Thanks

Mohsen

They seem like perfectly reasonable requests to me.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
450pips after float and commission. Not bad for a day.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
200 pips on GBPJPY is always 2.0 regardless of broker's digits.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hello,

Good result.

I can see that you trade GBPJPY in M1.

My big question is:

When you put the EA in the chart? You see one more indicator to see the trend?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi. What settings do You use? Default from the first post? What is Your broker (i see 1,5 pips spread on GBPJPY)

--- 帖子 #230 ---
My understanding is that the EA is not timeframe dependent. I'm not using any other indicator. The only thing I do is to set daily equity profit. when the account equity get to that target I closed all trades.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
tundex,

what broker do you run this demo ?? or live cant tell.

its showing 1000 leverage and tight spreads. never seen that before, thats why i am asking.

thx

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I used @Carneiro setting. Broker is TradersWay.

Sorry, haven't been here for long, and do not know the complete name of post to do search or find it on your profile...

Can you give full name of post, or post link in reply?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #234 ---
This is post 94. Although please be aware that I don't think the EA will perform as described in the settings of TRUE, TRUE. I believe it will only perform as TRUE, FALSE or FALSE, TRUE.

On a side note, I have tried various scenarios to change the EA from entering BUY/SELL mode to BUY UP only SELL DOWN only and have found very little value in this as the DD situation can worsen. It seems that the trail of opposite hedging trades need to take place in order to balance the equity DD.

You can play with it if you want, there might be something in it for the development of when to change modes but my opinion at the moment is to keep entering BUY/SELL positions on every grid level until I can figure out a way to reduce the DD.

You would think I would be happy to see that MAX DD with my settings was £600 per 0.01 lot but I am striving to lower this DD even more. For people with small trading accounts it is crucial to get a better figure yet still.

I'm not too good at coding but this is what I wrote for equity % that I'm using currently,

extern double ExpectedEquityTarget;             // closes all orders once account equity is greater than expected equity target

extern double IncreaseEquityPercent = 10.0;       // Equity percentage

int init()

{

ExpectedEquityTarget = AccountBalance() + (AccountBalance() * (IncreaseEquityPercent / 100));     // Calculate the amount balance should be increase by

}

int start()

{

if(AccountEquity() > ExpectedEquityTarget) {                // check if the account equity is greater than expected equity target

CloseAll();                                                                // call a method to close all trade

}

}

I hope this can help.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #238 ---
YES, I think it does help. Thank you very much

Could you add a bit of code that will disable the EA and only re-enter trade the next day? I think this is what most people want out of their equity close option.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #239 ---
sorry for stupid question ,

why don't open any position (in chart and in test)

thanks ... i think i'm crazy

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi & Welcome,

The EA is not meant to open a position immediately. It works on round numbers. Depending of the settings and pair that you use, it will open specifically at the round number setting that you have told it to.

If you need any help, just shout!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #241 ---
You are not crazy, my friend....As keydcuk says: If you need any help, just shout!

--- 帖子 #242 ---
default setting in test 1y no open position e/u

!?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Default settings are the default settings for the GBPJPY.

For the EURUSD you can try your own round numbers settings.

0.0001 = 1 pip

0.0010 = 10 pips

0.0100 = 100 pips

With the JPY pairs

0.01 = 1 pip

0.10 = 10 pips

1.00 = 100 pips

With the default settings of GBPJPY, you would have been taking grid steps of 20000 pips steps. This is why trades were not opening.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I'm testing the option of disabling EA as equity is hit presently but it is still not disabling all EA only the equity manager I modify alone. I hope to work further on it tonight. Hopefully I will come up with something useful.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #245 ---
How the EA determine when to close losing trades?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
It takes groups the buys or the sells in separate groups and then takes profit at whatever TP your settings are at. When there are multiple positions, it calculates the net profit/loss and converts it into pips in order to match the TP setting that you have chosen.

Cheers!

Daniel

Hi Daniel,

i am testing Your EA Piggy on DAX30 with good results.

bad news is that i closed my metatrader and lost testing. Most critical was 8/Feb where was big drop with little retracement. But with 10k USD and good set up it stayed alive with DD ~10% 0,02 lot.

My tick testing is very slow  so Nov/2015-April/2016 will take more than a week. If You have any idea how to speed up tick testing mode pls let me know.

screen below shows result in tick mode from 8/Feb and pending.

Thanks

mojepole

--- 帖子 #248 ---
It won't help a great deal but it will help some.... right click your chart and go to the objects list / click inside and press ctrl-A together when you have selected all and your lines are blue, click delete. Deleting your objects on the chart will help speed up the tester but it will not perform any miracles.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi Daniel,

done. i just hope this will speed up , even a little.

One thing -> EA in my case not working with both true/true option. Run when i set first option false and buy mode / sell mode true.

take care

mojepole

--- 帖子 #250 ---
YES, I was hoping that both settings at true would become a bit of an experimentation more but this is not the case. The settings at TRUE, TRUE do not work with version 4a. To be fair, the adjustments for this can be done in any which way as you simply need to adjust your lot size to have 0.02 BUY lot in the upward grid steps and 0.02 SELL lot in the downward grid step.

This is a bit interesting as I have been talking about DD and TP. I ran a test on this and for only about £90 more DD you gain about £500 on the 3 year test.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hello,

What is you settings to use in the DAX?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
[quote=timmy;8881205 lets say as you mentioned you start your grid on downward moving PA and it created a Sell, Sell (SS) at step1 and then moved on down to step0 - it would first open two new sell positions here and close out one of the sell trades from step1 and move the other to BE. So now if PA moves back up and breaches step1 it will open two buys (BB), as it moves on up further it will now close a buy as it reaches a new step and move the other trade to BE. So at every point the grid is closing regular trades for profit. But now you start to see your equity line track south of your balance- because of the toxic sell trades at the bottom of the grid. But as it moves more steps up the equity line will slowly reverse and, if enough steps are breached in the buy direction (for this example) then it will neutralise the toxic trades completely. In fact under this example you would only have to move three steps upward to neutralise one of the bottom sell trades or both will be neutralised together after 5 steps up.[/quote]

in post 97 you mentioned that:

1.

after a move down and price reverses, we have our first 2 buys.

at this time we have 2 sell danglers open from the grid level below.

eliminate those 2 sell danglers with the sell located 2 steps above from where we opened the 2 new buy orders.

2.

in the quote above, you don't exit the sell danglers with the sell from 2 steps above.

while the price keeps going up, you leave the sell danglers and they will be neutralized after 5 steps up.

so were you using method 1 or 2 to exit the danglers?

in method 2, when will you really close the danglers and will you also close any profitable trades to offset their loss?

thanks Tim

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Okay,

But in what moment you place the EA in the pair? (enter in the Market)

In the london openning for example, in the evening .....

OR

When You saw a trenline.....

So... this is the question

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Guys I test EURJPY and AUDJPY and it works very good with the default settings.  2015-JAN-01 to 2016-APR-20

Anybody have the best settings for EURUSD and GBPUSD? For first version EA v4 please

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I m doing in GBPUSD, setting 0.005. 30 pips target. going well last 4 days .

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi Yonnie,

I was just responding to your new scenario that you gave me in your follow up post where you asked how I would eliminate dangler trades if I didn't have higher sell trades (or at least this is what i thought you were asking).  So not two different methods - just two different situations.  I also was making the point that depending on how you want to use your stash of open contracts you could get rid of one dangling toxic trade after three steps back up or both if you wait for five steps back up (assuming it gets there) - its up to you how you strategise these situations.  Go look at what you asked me.

The idea is to incorporate a toxic trade clean up approach such as my suggestion - but is systematic for all reversal situations as best you can make it.  Make your rules.  This will go a long way to limiting those potential big DD positions - when you overlay it with the asymmetric close system, and thus allow for a greater risk profile to be used... and so more profit.

Cheers

Tim

@keydcuk

Does it matter what timeframe to put on your EA?

What do you use?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Please be aware that that year 2015 was an easy year for backtest. I have tested many times this year. Different results occur on longer periods. This is why I no longer serious test anything less than between 2013-present and even then I am looking to get more data in order for me to do longer tests.

ALSO SINCE I AM ON THE SUBJECT OF BACKTEST, for those of you who consider it any valuable piece of information, please consider that the Max DD number is only based on closed positions. What this means is that equity only gets calculated on the graph and in final figures of what are the values at any closed position profit or loss. There may and likely to be a floating bigger DD value than what is recorded and displayed on your report.

Enough said by others that the only true test is in forward test. But I always find backtest on SOME EAs to be a good guideline to find your settings and only to give you a ROUGH IDEA of how much money you need to trade 0.01 lot.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #262 ---
NO, it does not matter what timeframe you use as there are no indicators in the EA and makes no calculation that are TF dependant.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thanks!

LET ME JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO ANNOUNCE THAT REMON'S EA IS NOW IN POST 1.

Without Mr Remon and his strategy ideas, I would not have come to the point of building the EA that I have built.

I invite anybody follower or not of his thread to visit and try it out. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=583322

THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION. I HOPE YOU FIND SUCCESS EITHER WAY!

THANK YOU MR REMON FOR ALL YOUR EFFORTS!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Today I went for an official event but did not close my trade before leaving. As you can see in the first attachment, the profit that I set was hit. All trades closed but the EA continue to buy and sell (still working on the code to stop all EA after profit is hit). Equity profit is set to 10% of account balance, which means I was expecting just 342.49pips and this already hit 914.8pips after float and commission.

The second attachment show the result of not stopping the EA after profit was hit.

its default which i understand is the settings for gj.

mine just does not nearly trade as much as tundex.

had it running since early london yesterday and today it placed 2 trades, thats all it did.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Yes I'm not using default setting. I used 0.05 which is very aggressive but I think to use this setting, the equity target is needed and also not good for all day long trading.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
This is an interesting comment as v4-1 is exactly the same as v4 except I added the triple trade hours filter, that is all

ah ok, .05 i am sure makes all the difference, makes sense.

HELLO THREAD FOLLOWERS!

I just wanted to throw something out here for your testing and comments.

Basically I have been trying to eliminate DD from the results I have got from running 3+ years backtest of 2013-Present.

After various and numerous mind numbing ideas, most have failed. I tried to get the grid to adjust according to price action and then came up with this far fetched idea. Why not open BUY/SELLS on bar opens? This was working somewhat great as in clustered areas, positions were mounting up but closing quickly as I was setting a TP of 100 pips to a 4H chart, then too much DD so I went to daily, still too much DD so I tried both every 3 and every 4 daily bars.

None of this good enough so I finally got to open BUY/SELL on each open of weekly candle and a TP of 200 pips.

Everything went swimmingly, I was really happy as I was going to get around £400 DD per 0.01 lot on this 2013-Present test instead of my previous best results of £600 max DD and then something happened.

I attach yet again what the problem is. Large trend moves with little retracement.

I am so annoyed that we can't get to a solution for this. I also attach what I like to call version X1 as it is only experimental and I don't believe it to be a stand alone for running an EA on it's own but I am thinking maybe it is a progression in how to make Piggy n The Middle better. I am not yet sure of this but I did like what I saw in the backtest.

I'm a bit of a loss for this. I got a few more ideas in my head but am appealing to people for ideas.

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #275 ---
daniel,

there is usually a zig zag between london to ny session.

so a timed entry like early to middle london going into reversal ny session. close with a targeted tp before session is over.

tuesday wed thursday that should work well. friday most likely as well, but sunday monday probably not.

thats my idea...................

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi Daniel,

have to admit You have interesting ideas. I quckly run this EA [ not tick mode ] for March and April and instead of 10080 i put 60. with almost 50% DD account starting 5k USD account finished over 6,7k US. I know it's nothing but worth to test for future.

I was also thinking about HA candels - if candel starts red EA open sell if next candel if red so EA again sell if next is white then buy position will open.

Not sure but maybe then we will ge with trend and close all positions once hit set profit?

I do not know if this work, just long shot.

thanks

mojepole

--- 帖子 #277 ---
The problem that you have when you enter only buys and only sells is that you enter what is more of a "linear grid" trading system.

I am reluctant to comment any more on this as I did say from the beginning that I might learn something I never thought would work.

This is easy enough to setup. Let me see if I can play with your idea and come up with something.

Cheers!

Daniel

I was trying to give you a solution to this exact problem.... but only Yonnie was interested.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
NOT AS EASY AS I THOUGHT! MY SOFTWARE IS NOT PICKING UP THE INDICATOR.

I programmed it right but the EA is not recognizing in backtest or forward test. I did program it to buy on white and sell on red and only on close of the candle but this seems a bit of a no go. It's a bit late here. I will revisit this tomorrow if anything, curiosity and a bit of fun

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Timmy,

I have not dismissed your comments, I have actually noted them carefully. I just didn't get around trying to implement what you have said.

I hope you are not offended. I have just been distracted from where I have been focusing at the moment.

I have actually tried the 2 buys on up and 2 sells on down. It just ends up producing a bit of extra DD. I know what you are talking about is sightly different. Where I am at the moment and proving to have difficulty is to have BUYS control SELLS and SELLS control BUYS. I am not a coder and the software I am using is not friendly to me when it comes to this kind of programming of TP.

Thanks for your interest in this thread. It is greatly appreciated.

Best Regards,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi Daniel,

Not sure You noticed, but in my 4a version after one day of testing in demo, EA starts opening positions as doubled. So two log positions with the same or sell.

see below.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Well guys, I put this EA in all JPY pairs, and EURUSD and GBPUSD, it is micro account $30usd credit balance, and here the results in live account. For me the V4 is the best for now, the DD in 6 years of BT in some pairs is not much. Almost 10% of this account in 3 days.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
hello Invermac,   can you please share your file set for live account?

thank you very much

Luca

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I suspect that you have your settings at TRUE, TRUE which in this mode it will not work as intended. TRUE, TRUE settings do not work and would not use it. This experimental version is to change BUY/SELL more to buy up only and sell down only when wanted. Either TRUE, FALSE or FALSE, TRUE are the only settings that should be used. If this was not the case, let me know.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

HELLO CODERS!

Can someone tell me what kind of int (bool, double, etc...) is it when I need to make a constant value as a multiplier? Example: *1.01

It is not a double so I am a bit stumped. I think I am nearly there with the equity function problem.

Thanks,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #287 ---
it is double.

int is 1

double is 1.0

bool is true/false

string is text

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hmmmm... that doesn't solve my problem as the constant I am needing to make available in the EA is one of a multiplier.

Example: If Profit (Equity-Balance) is > than Balance *1.01 then close all trades and terminate EA.

I TRIED ENTERING IT AS AN "INT STRING" AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
@daniel as I send to you the last time I think this is what you want to achieve

double num = 1.01     // This is the value you want

then you have to to this

if ((AccountEquity()) >  (AccountBalance() * num)) {

CloseAll();                                                                  \\function to close all trade

TerminateEA();                                                           \\function to terminate EA

}

I already set the code I'm writing to start at a particular time and close all trade if equity balance is more than expected equity balance. I also added trade to close at a specific time and friday if you don't want the trade to go over the weekend. The current problem I have now is to make the EA start again without reloading the EA manually.

Attached is what i have so far.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Sorry, I did see this. I was waiting to see if you could add the code to terminate the EA afterwards. I will try this code but I have not yet been able to copy and paste stuff in an EA and make it work yet. LOL

--- 帖子 #293 ---
The value can be just a double e.g. 1.0 (1% = 1/100 - 0.01).

Then this can be use to find expected equity profit = balance * (1/100)

Then you have if (AccountEquity() > expected equity profit)

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I was able to terminate EA earlier but reload is manually done but what I want to achieve is to just stop the EA ( this is achieve in this version), current problem is for it to restart.

you can test the EA I attach and see, set end and close to 1min apart it will close all trades but If I enter the date it will not start automatically except I reload afresh.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I dont think you can restart the EA after terminating it. Unless you reload. Try using the function Sleep.

Do the Math

Time to Restart - Current Time (when started sleeping) = amount of time to sleep

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Just so there is no confusion your CloseAll() function closes only the trades with that magic number right?

Hi,

Here are my tick testing for 4a version on DAX30.

I was testing from Nov/2015 but i lost results and had to start from Mar/2015. As far as i remember there was no DD higher than 10% between Nov/2015 - Feb/2015. The only one is which You can see is between 10-15/Mar where was high peak with small retracement where Sell orders were hit and then move up again.

" If Profit (Equity-Balance) is > than Balance *1.01 "

if((Equity-Balance)> (Balance* "1.01"))

left operand is greater than the value of right operand. You are trying to compare a numerical value to a string of characters.

try using

if((Equity-Balance)> (Balance*StrToDouble(StopEquityProfitFactor));

AFTER CONSIDERATION, I THINK I WILL RELEASE THE MQ4 FILE SOON.

I don't see any more value in keeping the file. If coders want to be greedy and not share their ideas and modifications, so be it on their conscience.

I was hoping to get a more positive response from my motives for keeping the file but have not gotten any.

I'm sorry if I have offended anybody with my issues with the mq4 file, it was not intended. All I have to say is when I release it good luck, because fxdreema code amongst all their template stuff in the middle and all over the place is not easy to read.

I should release v4 and v4-1 mq4s shortly in hope that others will find improvement in them and share with the rest.

Happy Pipping!

How did you come by this code?

It's much easier for people to help when they can follow the logic through.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
As I have mentioned all along. I am not a coder. The code that you see in the mq4 is generated by software called fxdreema.

I don't know what else to say on this?

It is a very good piece of software for those who don't know how to code. If anybody wants to recode it into something more coder friendly, I am more than happy to explain the strategy step by step behind this and then we can have a coder friendly EA and take it from there.

Anybody just let me know and I will go through the steps in which the EA performs if someone wants to recode a coder friendly version.

I would do it myself but I have very little knowledge in coding. I am taking lessons from a generous person who is offering it to me for free but he is in Australia and the lessons are slow.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Daniel,

one good thing would be : you take a screen picture of the fxdreema structures. write above it explaining each block. and add to the picture the futures you want to add.

so people like that know the software will understand easier. and people who dont know the software can know wich block to search for in the code.

Just an ideia....

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Pretty simple stuff really. I would think that this would be pretty easy for a coder to do a much simpler mq4 file.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi Daniel,

check this version please. You can import the mq4 to your fxdreema. Go to Project menu / Import Project. Will be easier to see the change I have made.

But here they are:

1. Added a close all trades if x amount of money is achieved. (the input must be a negative number)

2. Changed the parameter of the round number block. Now 30 pips will be 30 pips no mather the currency pair.

3. Took out the #Groups 1 and 2. Now the closing block filter by buy/sell

4. Added external variables to make the input tab look better

5. I dont see a point in using a time filter in a EA like this but I changed that one to a single one from 0 to 24 hours as default.

now if you want you can add to the block 17 (after it closes all trades when the loss is achieved) the Block Terminate (will stop the EA and will work just I reattached).

This version is working different from the other one as now it really just open the trades at the round number. If the performance of the other is better just change again the block round number to price fraction.

If you need anything...just ask

Add a trailer stop (TP)

Add a function that close a losing order that exceed a certain amount of pips

1. TrailerStop

void MoveToBE()

{

RefreshRates();

//double vbid    = MarketInfo("EURUSD",MODE_BID);

//double vask    = MarketInfo("EURUSD",MODE_ASK);

//double vpoint  = MarketInfo("EURUSD",MODE_POINT);

//int    vdigits = (int)MarketInfo("EURUSD",MODE_DIGITS);

//int    vspread = (int)MarketInfo("EURUSD",MODE_SPREAD);

double StopLevel = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_STOPLEVEL) + MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_SPREAD);

if(TrailingStop < StopLevel) TrailingStop = StopLevel;

for(int order=OrdersTotal()-1; order>=0; order--)

{

if(!OrderSelect(order,SELECT_BY_POS))continue;

if(OrderMagicNumber()!=MagicNumber)continue;

if(OrderProfit()<=0)continue;

if(OrderType() == OP_BUY)

{

// check for trailing stop

if(TrailingStop>0)

{

if(Bid-OrderOpenPrice()>Point*TrailingStop)

{

if(OrderStopLoss()<Bid-Point*TrailingStop)

{

OrderModify(OrderTicket(),OrderOpenPrice(),Bid-Point*TrailingStop,OrderTakeProfit(),0,CLR_NONE);

}

}

}

}

}

for(int order=OrdersTotal()-1; order>=0; order--)

{

if(!OrderSelect(order,SELECT_BY_POS))continue;

if(OrderMagicNumber()!=MagicNumber)continue;

if(OrderProfit()<=0)continue;

//if(OrderType() == OP_SELL);

{

if((OrderOpenPrice()-Ask)>(Point*TrailingStop))

{

if((OrderStopLoss()>(Ask+Point*TrailingStop)) || (OrderStopLoss()==0))

{

OrderModify(OrderTicket(),OrderOpenPrice(),Ask+Point*TrailingStop,OrderTakeProfit(),0,CLR_NONE);

}

}

}

}

}

2. //Amount to close losing orders

for(int i = 0;i <= OrdersTotal() - 1;i++)

{

bool select = OrderSelect(i, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_TRADES); // select one after another

if (OrderSymbol() == "EURCADmicro" && OrderMagicNumber() == 147258) // order check

{

if (OrderProfit() <= LossToClose) // check losing more or equal to

{

select = OrderClose(OrderTicket(), OrderLots(), OrderClosePrice(),Slippage, Red); // close nagitive order

}

}

}

Hi Guilherme,

Thanks for your modifications. I've had a quick test and it seems to be doing the exact same as the original except it has more user friendly inputs. I only realized afterwards that I  could change the round numbers to pips on the web version of fxdreema and didn't do this while tinkering and waiting for a new release of the EA.

The only thing that I would point out and then again it might not be useful for most people is to give the independence of lot sizes on trade as some might want to put more weighted positions to the buys that go up step and the sells that go down step.

I appreciate your participation in this as there is something that you are doing different with the blocks that has got me thinking around a problem that I had in the original which your configuration may solve the problem. I won't say what yet as I don't know if this improved method in my head is going to be an improvement at all. I will test this first.

I only started to learn about changing the inputs with different names so if I get another version out, I will modify stuff to be more user friendly.

All and all, I am very happy with this and I thank you again for your help!

Best Regards,

Daniel

Hello Tekkies,

Adding actual code to this kind of EA proves to be difficult as the mq4 file is not user friendly. That is why I am appealing to coders to do a coders version of this EA as this has only been done through GUI fxdreema. Having said this, I am looking at trailing profits and BE. I was only thinking about this last night but am struggling to implement it in fxdreema. If I was a coder, I would have easily added this as I think it is a great idea.

I guess we'll just have to wait and see if we have a volunteer to make a coders version of this EA.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

This is your ea and your idea.

Would you have a problem if change some code by adding

1. stoploss

2. trailer stop

3. increase lot as deposit increase or visa vica

4. close losing order that exceed x-amount of pips

5. open order according to trend

At this point, I am happy for anybody to modify the EA however they see fit. The only thing that I ask is that you share your ideas and your modifications with the rest of us.

Any EA that is worthy of using after testing will be attached in post 1.

The way I see this is that it is not my EA. I am here for the people and the best method that will work. Forex trading is hard enough that it is just simply greedy if you are not willing to share with those who follow the thread.

As for your ideas, the only thing that I would point out as I have already tested a lot of different variables with the method is that if you are going to use trailing stops, that you stick to the original method of using group buys and group sells together.

It is important that we close all positions together in order to keep the DD as low as possible.

This is nothing against Remon's method, it is because of him that I was able to produce my EA, but I have not yet seen any of the produced EAs on his thread that can keep the DD as low as the EA I have produced. Although having said this, I have not intensively tested HIS EA but I am taking a sideline on this as what I have tested, I am not satisfied so I am letting the testers to their thing over there and also waiting for Remon to take the bugs out of his EA because at the moment, I am not seeing enough profits, too many losses taken and DD is still not brilliant.

Thanks for your participation. It is greatly appreciated.

Daniel

Hey thanks for the MQ4.

I tried the EA last week and am happy how it aggregated baskets of feasible trades, but was disappointed by the timing of the close. In most cases, the close was premature, i.e. closing favourable positions just when the market was moving in the right direction.

I had developed an indicator that was based on MA first and second derivatives (my own invention), and I believe it would be a good signal to use to slow the release. In the graph attached, you can see an illustration of this. I used the EURUSD to play last week. You notice the histogram in red is below zero, i.e. showing a favourable selling situation. And, Piggy in the middle as it is written now aggregated a basket to sell at 14:36.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

However, my indicator showed this was in prime selling trend, i.e. would have held off to close a sell until 15:01. That would have given a 46 PIP difference.

As you have shared the MQ4, I will try to add a filter to allow trades only when my indicator is showing it's time to release.

I have observed this behaviour a few times during the week so I believe that combining piggy in the middle with the MA_derivative_Evolution as I designed it would be a good hybrid. I'll work on it and let you know the outcome. I first need to get into your code to understand it and start making mods to see if I can come up with something that works. PM me if you want more details.

I attach and EX4 version of my indicator.

After a good look at the coder friendly version offered by Guilherme, I have to ask you to be patient - there are about 100 functions in this beast!

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I think for now until a proper EA is developed and tested thoroughly it is important to keep the multiple trading session that keydcuk had in his EA. I don't think we need four like he had but two would be nice. For example if you want to trade only between 20:00 to 04:00 you need two entries, one from 00:00 to 04:00 and a second from 20:00 to 23:59. I fyou guys could keep that feature I would appreciate.

I also think keydcuk is right about we should keep the different lot size option. Throughout my testing having a setting of .02, .01, .01, .02 for lot sizes produced better results than .01 across.

Finally the more I test this EA the more I am starting to think that the only way the DD will be reduced further down is by adding an indicator to help catch the start of a trend and programmatically change the way it trades and then change back when it start going sideways again. It sounds easier said than done obviously but with the smart people we have here I think it can be improved that way. I know it would be nice to stay away from timeframe dependencies but if it is for the greater good it will be worth it in the end.

Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I think the problem with identifying the trends is that if we knew how to identify it, we would trade it instead of wanting to avoiding it while using a grid trading EA. The whole purpose of this grid EA is that we don't know whether market is going to go up or down so we hedge, grid and strategically close positions. Find me someone who can properly identify trends and they would not need this system. There is more money to be made in the trend. This is simply what I like to call safe trading.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Haha! You certainly have a point there. However I am not sure there is more money to be made when trending vs ranging. You make more money in a shorter time period but the market trends only 30% of the time while you make less in ranging markets but for longer period (70%). Depending on the strategies you use in both situations it might just turn out to be a wash.

Hey! If it would be easy there wouldn't be a market to start with, wouldn't it?

Fantastic work so far from everybody involved though especially you and remon.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
This indicator is good only in Trending Market. No real benefits in ranging markets where market remains for 70% of its time. I have previously automated it and the results not so encouraging.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
This is the slope line indicator.... all indicators will work in trending markets... and they will suck in ranging markets

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Sorry, here is more information about MA_Derivative_Evolution:

I used my mathematical background from university (I am an engineer) specifically from differential equation classes, to come up with this indicator.

The principles of this indicator are simple - A mean average is calculated. The slope of this mean average is calculated (i.e. the value of the mean average at bar 0 minus the value at bar 1). Those slopes are averaged to filter jagged market information. The second derivative is calculated on the filtered slopes, i.e. slope at bar 0 minus slope at bar 1. When the second derivative crosses zero, the MA is doing an inflection, i.e. the main trend is changing.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Mean average variables:

Timeframe used in average calculation - set to 0 in a 1M chart.

Number of ticks used in mean average (A mean average is the basis of this indicator) - I used 112 in the pics I showed you.

Averaging method (self explanatory) - I used 1 (exponential) in the example shown

Average price used in MA (self explanatory) - I used 6 in the pics I showed you

Based on the MA, it calculated the slope of it (this is the orange histogram) - let's call this the main trend slope. In differential equation term, this slope is also called the first derivative. If the orange is above zero, main trend is positive, if it is below zero, it is negative.

The mean average 1 parameters next are used to make an average of the slope, and calculate the second derivative (i.e. a slope of the slope).

In the pic I sent you, I used 10 for the Period for average - this sets the filtering of the orange histograms into the blue line

I then used an exponential averaging method (1).

The second derivative is calculated on the large brown histogram. When the second derivative is below zero, the microtrend (i.e. the twist in the main trend) is going down, the slope is accelerating downwards. When it is above zero, the microtrend is trending up, it is accelerating upwards.

When the second derivative crosses zero, this creates a pivot point in the trend. These pivot points are shown as pink and pale blue arrows on the graphic

So far, I hope you see there is no rocket science, all I have been doing is calculating a Mean Average, the slope of the MA, and the slope of the slope. However, I felt that in order to get a meaningfull buy or sell signal, sometimes the MA's are too slow to react, i.e. they hang up until the signal decays. Here is screenshot of a slow decay (i.e. my indicator without the Evolution signal). You can observe a number of negative orange histograms because the MA is slowing catching up to the price action, and this slope is negative despite price action slowly creeping upwards.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If I was using only the first and second derivative to create a buy or sell signal, in this case, I would be selling when in fact the price action was moving upwards - not very smart. However, notice how the filtered slope and the slope differ - at the left of the screen, when the program detected a pivot downwards, the slope got under its average, and the difference between the 2 is what I call the evolution signal. i.e. a price action in the direction of the evolving trend. When the 'Evolution' is in the direction of the main trend, I can create a buy or sell signal. When the 'Evolution' is not in the direction of the main trend, I discard it. The 'Evolution' signal is thus created to avoid the lag seen in using only MA's, and filters quite well the decay.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I tried using this indicator in a buy/sell strategy and as indicated, it only works 30% of the time as it is a trend following strategy.

I provide only for now the ex4 because there is more complexity to it - the mq4 I created uses a modified moving_average.mq4 function to calculate the derivatives so if I provide you the ex4 only, I don't need to complicate the discussion as they are compiled in it already.

However, what I can tell you is the function also creates hidden buy sell signals in buffer 3 (+1 for buy and -1 for sell). These are the signals I am trying to incorporate into Piggy in the middle. A buy signal would happen on a blue histogram (Evolution is positive), and the reverse for sell signals.

I believe incorporating this into a custom function should work relatively easily. What I found is that when Piggy wants to close a basket of sell trades and my signal shows a strong sell signal, I should wait until my sell signal fades out and reap way more profits.

Feel free to PM me for more info.

Unfortunately, I'm sorry is just an opinion and nothing personal, any site with big operators to say we do not use INDICATORS ...

CANDLES SPEAKS MORE THAN WHAT INDICATORS, LOOK CANDLES WEEKLY (W1) and DAILY (D1) AND SEE WHERE THE PRICES GO.

LOOK AS FINISHED SAIL WEEKLY (11 April 15) AND SEE WHERE WAS THE PRICE IN (18 April 22).

I believe we have to have a direction to trade, but I think it should not be with indicators.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I twist a lot to have an EA where we do not know which direction the price go ... but I find it very difficult,,, see the hard work here keydcuk and remon.

I believe in the possibility to start the entry in one direction and from a certain number of pips, the price is not in favor, EA be enabled to make some defense ...

Still doing tests with both EA and keydcuk date bac, but I think we have to give preference to one direction. We know we will lose some entries, but see how many pips would gain following for example the direction of the weekly candle (W1) = Daily (D1).

Just an opinion

--- 帖子 #335 ---
The issue I got with this is that I can't do any backtesting as it involves more than 1 timeframe.

I attach the configuration and the EA and mq4 so any people using fxdreema want to play around with this.

Basically it does what you are suggesting I THINK.

I have left the EA to be bar sensitive so you will need to run this on a 4H chart. I have done this in case you want to try same daily & weekly conditions but triggering on a different TF.

1. Once every bar does a check

2. Conditions are set to see if Weekly Candle & Daily Candle are BOTH Bull or Bear

3. If the conditions are met, a buy positions gets entered when price is higher that previous candle's high +10 pips and a sell is entered if price is lower than previous candle's low - 10 pips OTHERWISE, EA functions in BUY/SELL MODE as per original.

4. Take Profit functions is unchanged from the original EA

Let me know if there are any tweaks needed.

I noticed the MA_Derivative_Evolution.ex4 I have provided hangs up the processor when alarms are used.  I thus provide you the rewritten version here.

As I said before, the buy/sell signal is on buffer 3 and exists when red (sell=-1) and blue (buy=+1) histograms show up.  The variable Sticky_signals should be set to false to allow the buy/sell signal to reset to zero in neutral periods.

Providing you the mq4 adds some programming complexity that I don't want to go into yet in this thread.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hello keydcuk and everybody here, I found this thread accidentally on Saturday and it took my attention to investigate more this mathematical approach to trading grid.

I made several backtests and came up with few ideas what we want to get from this EA - reasonable output, not something that we are not able to achieve.

What do we want to achieve? Steady yearly return with reasonable risk involved during all possible predictable market circumstances? that is something what I want to get. 30-50% yearly is my target, with acceptable DD around 50% under the worst market conditions that happened in the history. So I backtested year 2008 and 2009. Screenshot attached, DD with 200 pips grid, 0.01 fix lot, 100 pips TP as a target gave me with the starting balance 5000 eur DD about 3000eur. This could be considered as the worst scenario what happened. Now about gains, with this setting EA gives average 8-15% yearly. I believe the survivability of EA is good in long term but the return when we count swaps and vps is not so good.

I would suggest to implement MA period 20 on D1 and according the slope increase lots for positions in trend. I trade some kind of grid system manually and I implemented 2 indicators just to spot the extremes of market and according that the positions are opened, but that is other story.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I don't know how you guys do it. It'll only take one day of a candle going only up or only down in one direction without return and the account will be blown at grid size of 5 pips.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
That is exactly what I'm testing, how long it will take for this account to be blown. And using equity target make me to get out of the market early enough.

1. Account 1 is started 2 - 3 hours before London open.

2. Account 2 is an hour before London and early London market.

What I noticed with my previous test is that if you want to use this settings you can't avoid to stay long in the market but one thing is that no one knows when the market will move as you described. I have another account that is running default setting but not focusing on it for now.

cheers

--- 帖子 #353 ---
But if there is both TP and SL?

If it smore winning days then loosing days everything is fine. With a 10% SL You can only lose 10%. Even if You loose one time/week and the other days is TP, You will win 30%/week. With 2 loosers/week its 10%/week.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I know that but for now I'm focusing on testing only TP for now. Probably I will test that later too.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
If its possible to have equity SL/TP in the EA, than it would be possible to trade Asian session. With 2 loosing sessions/week....still very good. With SL there is no risk to blow the hole account.

ALL grid strategies is to multiply accounts,

you have to accept the losses (blown account)

you have to accept you can only predict / trade market to some extent. (~%70 trading win = holy grail)

check previous grid threads here on FF (especially quantum london / dragonexperts' correlation)

you start with 2 accounts:

acc. 1 generates %300, acc. 2 blows.

you continue trading with open 3 accounts.

All I will say is that I don't think forex trading should involve the expectation of blowing accounts with the exception of what senior traders tell newbies about what typical traders do. Other than that, welcome to the thread

I will repeat what I said last week,,, I see very blah blah blah, and no one posting test results,,, I'm coming to a logical conclusion,,, I do not see that any EA can bring steady profit in the forex market ...

we talking about the same things, but demodo different every day,,, and no one here shows consistent results, showing how you are doing.

It's just my opinion ... LET'S GIVE ATTENTION TO FRIEND WORK keydcuk

Yes, I saw a Youtube video on the virtual dealer plug in back in 2011 and every broker I have contacted since, I have asked them if they use it

Not that they would admit it of course.

Before that I traded UK stocks which as you know has a central exchange but the 2 things I don't like about trading stocks are they close at 5pm and you can often get gaps when it opens in the mornings. This is ok if you can day trade but if you grid trade it causes all sorts of problems.

At least with Forex we only have 1 gap to worry about.

Also with Forex I can open an account with as little as £1000 and happily trade using leverage. You really need larger amounts IMO to trade shares.

Hello tundex,

You only use Carneiro settings? and in wich session you are using the EA?

Hi Tundex

Thanks for that - opened a new pair same template and shortly after - BOOM - it happened!!!

You still doing ET's work - if so have a manipulated setup with NLD and ET's MA seems very good, don't want to distract from this great thread so PM me if interested?

Thanks again for the assistance

If you use GBPNZD the round number should be .0005 if you want 5 pips grid.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
ok, today was the first time i switched on the EA, this is a monster, need to figure out what amount is required to trade something like this in live account, maybe play more with gridsettings im testing gbpjpy with 5 pip, so many trades. I started at roun 06:00 my time. Not sure how profittaking is taking place. I assume there allways will be many trades open unless trading time is limited and price all of a sudden walks pass my trades to profit, knowing me i don't think that will happen, most times heading south, which is the opposite of where i want to go, north.ok changed from 5 to 15 pip on a new 500 usd demo. At the moment again 9 trades the margin required is eating, so i hope i get to see, green pips and less open trades, this is still too much for me, can anyone help to get me going

Hi Carneiro

Count me in on your thoughts re testing various ideas/settings and publishing for ALL to benefit, maybe in a spreadsheet - who knows.

Obviously 1 person should co-ordinate to get planned results ... your idea I nominate you if you are willing?

I assume as I am new to this post that you would want to test certain Pair/s with certain settings at certain times ... maybe more ... leave it to you ...

PS re your settings what was the Pair/s? and time? ... thanks

And of course this would be with the approval of keydcuk as it is his thread.

Is it anyone can crack this EA (grid system) ? I want to remove the expiry date, broker name,demo version , and unlock pair(now locked for GU).

Im tested this EA in Demo for 1mth and looks promissing. It will close when reach target profit that we key-in.

It has

I am grateful for your thank confiança..muito but talking method come.

First I would like to see people doing more tests,,,

We have to do this EA in a way that it will deleting the entries they become negative ... I do not know if I can explain.

Each "basket GRID", we can use that name.

Every Basket GRID, eliminate 50% of "distant negative operations" ... is only an example, because I do not know if this calculation is correct ...

We can not build distant negative positions.

Account 2 hit equity target.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
hello guys

doing some testing with Piggy and i have a couple of insight that could help maybe

first i'm not sure that gbp/jpy its the best pair to trade with cause of the higher spread compared to majors like usd/jpy

second i guess that double on the lotsize of the winning side could help..

in my picture for example, when the market start to dip we could use a 0,02 instead of a 0,01 in order to compensate the buy side

what do you think about this? could be possible to modify it to give it a test?

in the picture i'm using a 5pips grid started an hour before london open

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Excuse me but I will ask a question that is silly, because I do not know if you've posted.

What are you doing?

You enable the EA only at the opening of London?

You are using what configuration? grid?

You close manually?

I'm sorry if you've answered it somewhere

--- 帖子 #403 ---
it would be best if the EAwould do it all by itself, i can not be sitting in front a the screen all day. I have been nursing it now for 2 days in a row as i struggle with a small acount and margin on all positions an floating negative pips is almost constantly a big problem, the balnce line in terminal turn red yesterday. then i switched to larger gridsize 15 pip. it would be great if as per original idea profits on one side would be used to close out the negative positions. i like to leave the ea on all day not to be

--- 帖子 #404 ---
1. Enable EA few minutes after London Open

2. The configuration is your settings with 0.05 and 0.01 lot

3. I use another EA to set equity profit. (I set 10% of account balance as equity target). The EA disable Expert when the equity target profit is hit.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Tundex,

interesting concept, may i ask which EA you use to check if target is reached and then disables the ea, can you please share?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I love grid EAs, but they can be extremely risky in a trending market or lack of adequate retracement. I have been trying them in various forms in many different EAs.

My main issue is the broker limit on open trades: this can vary from 150 trades to 500 open trades. Once you reach this limit - regardless how much available margin you have - this system will fail.

Any grid EA needs to be selective when opening trades to prevent catching a trend and reaching the open trade limit. This would also reduce margin load as better quality trades are opened, grids are closed sooner, and equity (and margin) increases faster.

Suggested studies for those interested: Tengri Scalper, Arin EA, and SWB Grid. These are my favorites, but none are "safe", and all have lost me heaps.

Forex Warrior, FX Splitter, Flex EA and many others I fail to remember are some other suggested studies on GM EAs.

In addition to pure GM EAs, you may want to consider pyramiding EAs like Sure Fire Hedging Strategy, and Brazil System (available from MQL Marketplace).

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Forget it! In the latest versions of MT4, ex4 files are difficult to decompile. Trust me, I have tried this before.

Your best bet if you want this done is to go on the mql5 forum and ask some Russian programmers that can possibly do it at a price.

I would be wary of getting ripped off though...

My 2 cents.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I am happy for anybody to do anything with my EA.

My only plead is that you share your ideas and/or modifications with the rest of us in this thread.

"FOREX TRADING IS HARD ENOUGH AS IT IS!"

Let me know if there is anything that I can do from my side...

Any valuable modified EA will be posted in Post No. 1

I will be honest with you all. At this moment, I have not seen any valuable modifications to this EA that can outperform what the EA can do already, The only thing that seems to be working for some is the idea of a tight grid with daily equity closes. Although I am not fond of the idea personally, it seems to be working for some. The only reason I have not added an equity close on my EA at the moment is because I struggle to get it in the programming myself.

If anybody can redo a coder friendly EA and add this equity function, it would be greatly appreciated. I have already explained how the EA trades, but if anybody need me to explain this again, I am quite happy to do so for the further development of a coder friendly EA.

I might give this a crack one more time, but am not thinking I will be successful on my own.

As a sneek preview, I am in the midst of developing another EA. It is not a grid trading EA. I will not publish anything that I don't think is worthy enough to share here at FF. When the time comes that I can crack the nut that I am trying to crack, I will let you know. If I get it right, this will be better than what I have been able to produce so far.

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I am not sure what you are nursing here? It is either you leave the EA to do its thing or your trade with equity stops. You do not need to be in front of your computer all day to wait for equity stops. Slap on and EA that will trade manage this for you on another chart and enjoy life

As for buys taking care of sells, I wish I could exploit this idea but it is very difficult within the EA to tell it to manage BUYS with SELLS and then have it switch conditions for buys to take care of buys and sells take care of sells. In anyway, when you are letting buys take care of sells, you are entering the zone of what is or is as near as linear grid trading. This method is not very good as you are telling the BUYS to close SELLS and the BUYS need to outnumber the SELLS and vice versa. In these conditions, you could go up to 3+months of not having anything close. The reason for this is that as the BUY is making profit, the sell is still losing on the way up. I still believe that the best way to kill toxic trades is when top SELLS are gaining in retracement profitability to eliminate the bottom losers.

I am not saying this for the sake of saying this nor am I saying this because I want to make myself look better but I have been grid trading far before Remon's EA thread has begun and I do know what I am talking about when I say that a linear grid trading method will only produce very long periods of DD and open exposed trades that never close quickly. 3+MONTHS trades that do not close because one side cannot overtake the other.

Just my 2 cents.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Thanks for this share. I will explore these EAs and see if there is any positive elements that I can take away to implement in what I've already got!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi Tundex

May I ask the name of the EA you use to to set equity profit. (I set 10% of account balance as equity target). The EA disable Expert when the equity target profit is hit?

Would be very useful if you could share ...

Thanks

--- 帖子 #412 ---
The reason I have chosen the GBP/JPY is for the original trade idea of long term gridding. It is the only pair that retraces back deep enough to surpass the 3+year backtest on my MT4. Although backtesting is frowned upon by some, it is still an indication of what the market would have done should the EA have been placed in these passed conditions. I know it is not a science as MT4 only simulates the tick conditions rather than go through the real ticks that would have happened, BUT I am happier with backtesting when it comes to gridding EAs because there are not false indicator production, they are simply buy and sell at pure price levels.

As for your idea of doubling lots, the issue that presents itself is what is a winning side? What is a losing side? Do or can we really predict the market movement? It is all speculative. The EA already takes profit when trends are taking place and when it is not in a hedge. When in a hedge and the retracement is taking care of clearing the toxic losers out, I think the best method is already used by saying close as quick as possible. We never know how far down it is going to retrace.

The best idea of being biased towards the trend, I believe it is the idea that I have presented to you in quite a few posts back. If you set your lot size of BUY in an upward grid to 0.02, leaving the sell to 0.01 and as well as the SELL to 0.02 and buy to 0.01 in the downward grid step move, the backtesting that I have done with this will show that DD will be fractionally higher but that overall profitability is better. If I were to trade the EA in live conditions, I believe that this is the way that I would go.

Please refer to this post to see what I am taking about... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...13#post8884213

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #413 ---
we definitly can't predict market movement but we can try to assecond the market movements

what is a winning side? well just the side with less order opened

this morning for example market on gbpjpy went strongly down with a 100pips move

at some point i had 1lot buy and almost zero sell cause the market wasn't retracing

if the ea had open sell trade with a 0,02 lot instead of 0,01we could have gain double of those money and proportionally reducing the impact of that drawdown

i hope i was more clear with explanation

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Here is the EA I used.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Yes, so I refer to my comments of changing the lot size value to 0.02 on the side that is favourable to the upward grid step or the downward grid step. This does introduce more DD but profitability vs DD I think this is the only condition so far that I have found where introducing more DD creates worthy profitability. The changing of lot sizes is already possible with the existing EA's capabilities. The first set of BUY lot size and SELL lot size is for the uptrend, the sencond set of BUY lot size and SELL lot size if for the downtrend.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
how the lotsize its gonna change? which is the filter? i missed this

--- 帖子 #417 ---
your system looks very interesanta, I have a couple of questions:

-has tried to start a second time in NY opening?

-which happens if there importatnes news during operation of the EA? many days between 9 and 10 GMT headlines in GBP, active EA anyway at the opening of London?

thank you very much

--- 帖子 #418 ---
First let me clarify, the system is not my system, I'm only testing @Keydcuk EA.

Concerning your question,

1. The test I did on a separate account for NY market was not successful, so I have not tested the EA again during NY.

2. Most time during important news the DD become very large and sometimes the news make the equity targeted profit to be hit on time.

3. Today makes it day 5 testing London market.

I'm not sure if I answer your question. I tried as much as I understand the question.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #419 ---
The grid step up and the grid step down is the filter. We don't expect PA to zigzag between grid points although it does on certain occasions but mainly PA takes one direction. If I could determine when to increase lot size from an indicator, then there would be no point of the grid. I would just trade direction. This EA hedges every position based on nobody being able to predict the direction. However without indicators, a bias towards pure price action is the only way I think.

Saying this, I don't think my opinion would apply in small grid situations. When I talk about my EA, I always talk about it with my recommended settings of 200 pips on the GBPJPY unless I explicitly say otherwise.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
i guess its better to talk about small grid situations ( with an higher daily profit ) rather than trying to optimize it over a long period just because every pair got important news that totally screw your backtest like currency rate interest, meeting of the currency bosses and so on

anyway on usdjpy even with a huge fall as you can see from picture the drawdown its definitly less!! profit too of course but 3% for an afternoon its a lot so coudn't complain about it

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hello tundex,

can you show us your settings of simpleAllPairBasket EA please? to active this EA with piggy EA in londo please?

cheers

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I am quite happy with the program, and the comments I put below are intended to help you improve the programming to get a better outcome and performance.

I noticed that the price action triggers a buy above the sell pair in the grid.  This results for any price in a negative position (i.e. if price is below the grid, the net loss from the loosing buy is greater than the benefit of the sell position - and vice versa - if the price is above the grid, the resulting net position is negative, i.e. the loss from the loosing sell is higher than the gain from the winning buy).  If price is between the buy and sell, I loose the commission and the spread in a locked position.

Would it not be advantageous to pair the buy and sell of the same grid position in the other direction, i.e. buy lower than the grid position, and sell above the grid position?  The optimum delta between the buy/sell and the grid could be calculated as a function of the spread and commission.

I also noticed Piggy places no pending orders but places them "in the flow".  For me, this results in achieved prices quite far from the grid point.  Not all users might have this problem as it probably depends on your network connectivity performance and how fast is your computer, etc. but for me it does affect performance.  If the program knows it will put an order around a grid level, it could put a pending order to achieve better performance.

A pip pip - Hurray!

--- 帖子 #423 ---
One more thing - I am still using PnMv4 - so maybe not an issue anymore.  Anyway, I wanted to avoid buys as the market was declining steadily and my DD was getting deep.  So I tried to put buy = 0.00 but because my trader's minimum size is 0.01, it triggered buys at 0.01 nonetheless.  How does one turn off one side of the trade?

A pip pip - Hurray!

--- 帖子 #424 ---
You can simply select Only Long or Short at the Common tab

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Thanks guilherme!  I learnt something.  I knew there was a simple way - I missed it, too focused on the data entry screen and not on my setting!

--- 帖子 #426 ---
If you look at the attachments of this thread, you will find PnTM v4a which does exactly that. You can set flags to trade buy/sells on grid points or only buy and only sell on up and down steps respectively. The only setting that will not work is if you set both flags to TRUE. I wanted to experiment thinking I could but it just is an erroneous setting. v4a... look for this if you want to switch modes.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #427 ---
This would not work because it would trigger buys on every step up or step down on the grid.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
You can increase the lot size on one side, sell 0.02 buy 0.01.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I dont agree. The EA would behave the same way. It would send the same comands / orders. But MT4 would allow to pass just the trades in the direction you chosed.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Nothing special. I just set my equity target to 10% and disable SL, other are default settings.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
No, I am asking what will happen when mt4 restarts if EA will recognise trades which placed or no? or it will start placing trades again from 0.01

--- 帖子 #432 ---
HI TEAM , First of all thanks and great work for entire team , am being observed EA from past one month which one is very profitable almost all pairs and am trading and testing now a days in real account also .... If some one add some FRIDAY true or false filter  it will be very great full too ... and also after collecting some profit to bucket entire cycle should close and reopen new cycle means it will be great full to trading....and by implementing some magic number for different currency pairs on same equity account which can able to manage the orders separately in same equity ... and also some DAILY TARGET LEVEL and reopen to new one because of entire order cycle should close and refresh to new one ...... Watching and Expecting always profitable ....
cheers entire team and KEYDCUK once agian...

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hi tundex,

Please tell me if this parameters are correct for:

5% gain TP

no SL

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Can you tell me if you need to activate the two EA's before london opens and then leaves until target % is reached? or the basket EA can activated automatically with the time work program like 3:00am to 11:00 am in my case?

I appreciate your time and hope don't bother you

thank you so much

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Yes 5% and no SL is right. I manually enable expert and the EA disable expert after equity profit is hit. Not sure about enabling EA, although my personal EA does that but I dropped it because it does not refresh all chart when the expert is enable.

WAKE UP here, you cannot run this kind of ea with $200...

--- 帖子 #437 ---
at least 2k$ if you hope to stay under 20% DD with a 0,01lot and 5pip grid

--- 帖子 #438 ---
HI Beragax . 200 $ means for cent account 20000 right ?? or cent account 200 cents is enough to run ?? .. please conform me ..

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Yes, this should be fine.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Dont use this ea this is dangerous

--- 帖子 #441 ---
to play safe this game I suggest to start at least with 5000$ if you want to trade long term with yearly return 10-15%. (almost stress free) Second option is to believe in God and luck and start with 200$ and hope that you will get a good market behaviour to squeeze more money than you deposited and repeat this process again

--- 帖子 #442 ---
yes, 200$ is 20000 cents that means you have to start trading with 0.001

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Thank you tundex, so I put piggy EA in one GBPJPY chart and the basket EA in another GBPJPY chart, enable autotrading 1 hour before london open and then when the % target reach the goal the basket EA will disabled the piggy EA that's right? then I disable autotrading?

I will do each day this?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Tundex,

Do I leave this settings default? or I need change something?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Do you have anything to back up this statement? Of course it is dangerous if you have not studied, tested, use bad settings?

Why post something like this and not back up what you are saying? At least if you had a valid point, I could look into it.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
You don't need that much money to yield 10-15% return. This EA can do around 50% return on £1000 trading 0.01 lot.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Keydcuk don't worry about this kind of comment, this people only want to be annoying, everybody here knows the potential of this EA. Tundex show us a great profitable way to gain 10% or more each day! and like you say 50% per month is easy with this EA, only focus in gain 2.5% each day per 22 days per month you will have 55% that's my strategy with this EA. I will trade in london session like Tundex does.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
The 50% I was referring to was actually yearly just leaving it on 24/7 with my preferred settings. This Tundex method, I need to further explore.. I haven't had much time to look into it as I am pleasantly distracted with another non-Grid EA project, but I am happy that people have found use to using it differently than I ever would have done. My hope is that all our collaboration will lead us to be profitable.

THANKS AGAIN TO ALL WHO PARTICIPATE IN THIS THREAD!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I put piggy EA in one GBPJPY chart and the basket EA in another pair. I enable autotrading  like 15 - 30mins after London open and when the target is hit the basket EA will diasble autotrading. So the only thing I do is to enable autotrading, I let piggy EA and basket EA do their thing.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Yes, you are right. I'm still in testing phase too. So I think people should test very well before going to live account. My goal is to stretch the EA with small amount, if the EA can survive and hit targeted profit consistently with $200 account, then on live the balance can be more than $200 using the same condition as the one tested will give more chance.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Here is my settings of the basket EA. I think if you set the first option on the setting to true, it may enable autotrading at the time you set on Monday but not on daily basis but I have not test this option.

Apart from the one here the other options below in the image are default setting.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Got it friend thank you very very much!, I will follow you in london session today, for me it will be 2:00am london open, another last thing I promise no more question, you start with $200usd demo account, how many lots per trade you put in piggy ea? you goes with the minimum lot 0.01? or a little more?

Cheers and have a great trading session friend.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
hello guys, can you tell me what version of piggy EA have tried and what you think is better?

UPDATED VERSION Piggy n The Middle v4-2

This version is functional all the same as v4 and v4-1 but in this instance, I have made the inputs more user friendly so people understand which input is buy lots in grid step up and down as well as sell lots in grid step up and down. Round numbers option has been defined in terms of pips and not price. (Thanks Guilherme for pointing out to me this was possible.) Triple Hours filter has been removed for a simple 1 time of day trade time as it seemed users did not have use for a triple filter Weekday trading has been added at the request of a thread follower. I try to keep the EAs I post with the best default settings of how I would try the GBPJPY but hopefully you will find use in trading differently should you wish to explore its capabilities.

I am still no closer to have a built in close trades and EA on equity gains. The only alternative is to use an equity manager. A very good one has been posted by thread follower "Tundex". It is well worth having a look at what he is doing with this, it seems to have potential. Also, I am not sure what Carneiro is doing at the moment with the EA but he as well seemed to have had good ideas to making the EA work for him.

Anything else, I am always glad to try to help

Happy Pipping!

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

thanks a lot for your work Keydcuk

i have another idea on how to improve the ea

why don't we try to open only long when the price goes up and only when the price goes down?

this way we will reduce the drawdown on a steep up/downmove, will reduce the margin usage while keeping the logic intact cause if there are less less order to recover we will need smaller retracement

what do you think about this? working good buy the way.. the idea to close the trades all together its awesome

i already saw this solution on the one and only profitable grid i saw but i was to inexperienced to copy and improve it

--- 帖子 #457 ---
@keydcuk you can try this, I use this in my previous equity code. You can calculate expectedequitytarget with this :

Double ExpectedEquityTarget = AccountBalance() + (AccountBalance() * (equity_target_percentage / 100))

Cheers

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hello tundex,

How goes the EA? I don't know if I did something wrong but I have negative results. I put 5% target in a $1000usd account demo.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Not sure what went wrong. Today was very hard as my own trades too ran deep into NY market and it get a very high DD but it survive by hitting target. May be your broker. I can't say for sure.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
After getting high DD the account end up hitting the equity target for today.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Friend did not forget the follow-up, just believe we have to have a direction to the inputs ... and I see that we can not have toxic inputs,,, I have been talking a lot of entries following the direction of W1 = D1 ...

It would be like this: on Monday thus opening the market look like closed the W1 candle (weekly candle) and see how closed the D1 Candle Friday if these shut candles in the same direction ... EA would make entries only for this side . If the candle friday closed different from the weekly candle, expect close a candle D1 in the week to make entries in the ...

--- 帖子 #462 ---
yes I know, with starting balance 1000 it makes 50% but with 5000 it is 10-15%. I run backtest from 2008 and the highest Floating loss was cca 3000. I used your best settings grid 200pips tp 100 pips and 0.01 lot.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Wonderful results, wich settings you are using? I see you share this settings

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...76#post8893376

or you are using Carneiro settings?

And the settings in basket EA I put the same like you only the last two I can't see what you have in your picture.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I use that same settings and as per the image, I left it as default since I have already turn useBasketBEandJump = false, useJumpStepTPmoves = false

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Sure I put that settings in false like your first image, I use FXCM demo account. Which broker are using?

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I use Tradersway.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Thank you friend, I guess is the broker, you have 1.80 spread me in FXCM have 4.0 and your leverage is 1:1000, mine is 1:100. I will try a demo XM with leverage 1:888 today. Maybe the Spread is not the problem I think is leverage. If I have negative results again then it will be the spread the problem.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
That is cool. Keep me updated with your progress.

What is the best alternative pair for GBPJPY? i have high spread

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I will revisit this idea again as it was what it did during versions 1-3 I believe. There is something in this EA and something I am currently working with another EA that may blend together. I'm going to have a real long play with the buy only sell only option. There might be something good to come out of it. I will let you know.

Cheers!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I'll see what I can do. I have tried inserting code into fxdreema and direct in the mq4 as well and don't seem to figure out how it works.

Thanks,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I did try to program this and was not very successful. I'll see what I can do.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Thanks keydcuk for the new version. It is more user-friendly. Great work.

I have a problem about the hour start and hour end. Having now only one timeframe as input, it seems impossible to let's say trade only between 8pm to 4am without having to change the settings every day. That's why earlier I was requesting to keep minimum 2 time filters. Would it be easy for you to re-implement this capability?

--- 帖子 #474 ---
nice

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I'm not surprised. 2008-2009 were the years we where in global recession. There was hardly any retrace at all on the GBPJPY.

Putting global recession aside, it would be interesting to have a risk equity for trading lots. The only problem is that the formula for taking profit is based on converting currency amount to pips. I might finally put an option for TP in money or pips, whichever the user chooses. It will be the only way I can put risk equity trading in place. The reason I want to do this is because it's ok to say 10-15% over them years but surely one could have traded with more money once the EA has made more money.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
You might have success with the GBPUSD as it will have similar behaviour but less volatility. I would make sure you test it before using any real money.

I believe Carneiro was using the EURGBP as well with his own settings.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
This setting for GBPJPY is the safest

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Sorry, I didn't look back at the posts. I thought you were trading a different pair.

In any respect, I don't think that spread on the GBPJPY is that bad considering that most of your trades become winning buckets. Only on some occasions of a lot of opened positions have I noticed that it closes at losses. Not sure why, there is nothing I can do on my end to make it different.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Sorry I forgot to tell you. That is not too hard. What I do is to use variable and this is what you will do:

Type                                                     Name                                                                                                                          Value

Double         ExpectedEquityTarget (or whatever you want to call the variable)           AccountBalance() + (AccountBalance() * (equity_target_percentage / 100))

This assign the variable and assign that value to it.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi all,  I am also in negative DD today.  A lot of positions are on the wrong side (all the benefits from the buys were closed and have a lot of loosing sell positions) then market went flat all day.  It must be a labour day issue as a lot of countries were off today, so slow market.  I wish you lots of movements tomorrow ;-) Thanks keydcuk for the latest version, I will put it to work tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
i'm sure its gonna bring better results cause if you think about it doesn't make sense to buy when the price in a small grid its going down for example without going up at least of grid space in order to activate the grid step up

i'm sure that this improvement will not change overall results cause it is not actually modifying the logic of the ea

just buying and selling when there is a reason to do so eheh

of course spread matter cause if you want for example to close the sell grid after 25pips or after 25euro/dollar of profit you have to count all the spread payed and recover it before the ea can close with a net profit

anyway i also noticed that sometimes the ea will close a group of trade with slight profit/loss althought i don't think it will be easy to solve this without creating other problems

look at the image for better and further explanation

anyway this ea its blowing my mind for its profitability/safety.. we got a little monster over here

just missing a few things and its ready to collect money 24/7

thanks a lot for your time spent coding and generosity sharing it

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hi Keydcuk

this EA does not work with any US brokers because of the hedging as you may know.

thanks

Seriously friend how you doing this? I try in XM account new leverage and the EA still working and yours already finish. Now looks better with this account but I have 5% target and I can't reach this goal.

and Open new Buy order ( buy Order 2) with doble lot 0.02 and set TP All Buy order at buyOrder-1 price.

- When Price drop again 20 pip, close sell order-2 and enter new sell order ( sellOrder-3) with same lot 0.01.

then Open new buy order ( buyOrder-3) with doble lot 0.03 and set TP all buy order at buyOrder-2 price.

Got all profit when retrace.

keydcuk,

I'm planning to switch from v4 to v4-2 because of the availability of time filter feature .

However, I'm not sure what to input into the Round number detector column to follow the current settings of v4 which I'm using.

Currently my present settings in v4 running on GBPJPY are... roundnumbersdetector 0.05, volume size 0.01.

Hope you can help. Thanks

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi,

The round numbers have been changed in order to avoid confusion between currency pairs. With your settings mention, it would mean you are running a 5 pip gird.

Cheers!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Yes, my settings is 5 pips which mean in the round number detector column I just input 50 (5 digit broker), right?

Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
I don't think it matters whether you are on a 5 digit or a 4 digit. 5 pips is 5 pips.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Ok, will just input 5 in the column. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
even when the DD its not high, after a while, the margin usage becomes massive

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Apparently I've been told that this depends of your broker. Also, I have been told that Global Prime does not charge the extra margin on hedge trading.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
It is was a bit late but equity still hit.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
My mind is still boggled to how such a tight grid survives!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I was thinking just the same

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Maybe you should aim a bit lower. I mean 45% in loss is quite the drawdown, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
BIT OFF THE TOPIC:

Does anybody know of any indicators that are good in telling you NOT to take trades? My next EA is nearly at the point of starting a new thread but it is still taking a few too many unnecessary trades and I don't want to change the trade conditions too much. It is based on ZZ and 3 Level Semafor. Anything that tells me it is not a bottom or a top would be useful. I am working off a 5 min TF. By this I mean any indicator other than standard stochs, RSI, MACD or MA unless it's a unique strategy that has been working for you.

This next EA is going to be a killer if I can just perfect it a bit more.

Thanks in advance,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Have you looked at CCS?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Well I don't know but still surviving. Let's see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I guess you have not read any of my past post. The goal here is to stretch the settings and see how far it will go in term of the account surviving.

1. I set out with three accounts. Two of which uses 0.05 for RN on GBPJPY.

2. The first trade 2 hours before London OPen (Acct1 _ blown).

3. The second trade few minutes after London open (Acct2 still running. $200 starting balance with equity profit of 10%). Now $572 in 9 days.

4. The third account is with 2.0 RN (I have not been running this account very well, so I can't give any result on that).

So far the London opening strategy with equity profit target is still the most effective for me. Though there are some days where the DD was so big but the account still survived.

Cheers

I never been much into "free ea's" I am always the first to be sceptical.

But this really looks promising. I started backtesting and I am pleasantly surprised.

In this thread it is stated that this strategy is not optimal when the market suddenly starts trending w/o reversals.

What if.... we combine it with a strategy that is performing well in a trending market ? What are your thoughts about that?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Hello mickael58,

sure here you go

The firs pic is piggy V4-2

Attached Image

the localtime is the broker time, in my case london open 10:00am broker time so change this to your broker time if you want

and second one is the basket for 2.5% daily

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I have many problems in the begin to test this like tundex, but then I discover why I have many negative results. The first testing was with GFC account demo and FXCM and for this strategy works we need an account with very low spread. So I open a demo account with XM Zero this account have no spread so this strategy works perfectly with this account.

And another important thing is the leverage. Tundex use 1:1000 so he can have 10% easy. I use 1:200 and try the get 10% and fail, so I go for 2.5%, JezVoss use 1:500 and he make 5% so see the leverage account by the target you want to gain. I think real account $1000usd with leverage 1:200 is not very risky with this strategy and make 2.5% daily.

have a good day

--- 帖子 #550 ---
The EA doesn't do too bad. It is very infrequent when it can't handle market conditions as price nearly always turns back on itself at one point or another. Major events like the global recession and about once a year there is a trend period of little retracement but it copes somehow if you have enough money in the account to handle the drawdown. Some are experimenting to see if a little grid can survive at selective times of the day and then stop trading when daily profit is achieved.

As far as combining the strategy with something that trends is a bit difficult as there are many factors to consider, mainly when to hedge and when not to hedge. Then there is the whole issue of getting an EA to trade trend. How do you define it? How does one define the end? Not only when does it do what but how does it do what and when? I think if I had the choice and could do it, I would build and EA that trades like a trend trader but am not convinced there are any indicators that can properly do the job.

I am currently working on another EA which is more trend reversal based. Maybe in the future I can find a way to get the best of both worlds. I am a bit new at EA creating as I am not a coder but a programmer with fxdreema.

If you think you have a good strategy be it trend or not trend, feel free to PM me and I will be more than happy to try to program it for you.

Thanks and welcome!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #551 ---
These 4500 lines of code for such a simple strategy are so hard to work on lol, better make an other ea to add the filters I think.

Would you be keen Keydcuk?

--- 帖子 #552 ---
The only reason it is that many lines of code is because the software I use fxdreema has a lot of template code in the making of EAs. I am quite happy to program anything so long as there are clear strategies I understand and can code.

The other option was when I appealed to coders to make a coder friendly version of the EA. I have explained all the steps and I don't think it would be a big job at all. I would do it myself if I knew how to code. I must get back on skype and make some time to keep up with free coding lessons I have been offered. I've only had one lesson so far

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Yep I've been using fxdreema and others EA builders in the past I know perfectly how it simulates stacks of codes.. Problem is that it's quite slow backtesting and optimizing such strategies on the long run (even more with filters) with so many useless lines of codes.. I'll work on it for you. Just PM me the clear strategy and I'll keep you guys updated

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Done! Thanks a whole bunch for your help!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I PMd you back regarding the round numbers, could you check it out please, also if the suscribers interested in such an EA could give me the filters they would like to use on the EA I'd be thankful. I'm planning on adding a filter based on the user preference (currently MA slope; MACD levels; CCI thresholds/levels; CCIMA slope; ADX levels)

Cheers

You are right, in this case is another grid EA with a diferent concept and I think the programmers can convine this to reduce the DD or avoid bad signal. Here the EA

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Do not worry E, they have not find anything special anyway.

Do not want to spoil the loving party here, but my experience tells me it is IMPOSSIBLE to have a grid based winning strategy. Just look all around you. Where are these magical grid winners? Surely for 10+ yrs of grid trading already, there should be some, at least...

The grid conception is absolutely stupid, cause the rate does not move ONLY based on a grid, but TIMING also plays very important role here. And it does create a grid over grid over grid over grid, ext. Multiple grids with other words. So, which grid are you going to trade?!?

Have a good luck with trading JUST one grid, without including THE TIME FACTOR and the multiple grids it does create...

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Hi, do you know the logic of this EA?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi mate, good to read you.

I agree with most of what you say. However I've crossed path with people trading for years systems that include grid derivatives successfully. Not this way of course, trust me I've been backtesting this ea in any possible way on any possible pair / metal / index, it just doesn't work as the increment is static and the wins can't cover the loss in-trend. The reason I'm coding this is to improve my coding, but not just this. I believe there is a way to identify ranging markets through momentum/main ADX/htf ma slope angle/channels. It's been a while I'm working on that direction. Avoiding news, avoiding trends, scanning the market for mean reversions, swings, and heavy range. Using in such a market a grid that is used dynamically (i.e. Bauta's adaptive grid) untill breakout or untill a trend initiates would be relevant and potentially work. That is where I'm heading and I'll be happy to keep you updated on my researchs

--- 帖子 #564 ---
I think the EA open trades only in one side, if trend up open only buy and when trend is going down the EA open sell. In the trend change the EA leaves one trade open to compense the floating loss. Try JAN 2016 to today in EURUSD settings default

--- 帖子 #565 ---
its not to disappoint you but this grid its working good for more than a few guys and the margin of improvement its huge since there are holes in the core logic

but in order to achieve success you first gotta believe in it and evaluate what is working good and what need to be fixed then find your way to fix it...

usually guys like you are too lazy for the mind process and this is why you wanna discourage everyone else to THINK about turning the IMPOSSIBLE into DONE..

kinda sad and funny at the same time ahahah you should not waste your time in forex and find another hobby..

this is not a funny one if you don't believe its profitable...

anyway only 1 mt4 of 3 its running properly.. somehow the ea don't wanna trade on the other 2 and settings are correct...

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I tend to disagree with your comment. If you are going to say this, you may as well say it about all EAs out there. With this particular EA it hedge grids. A lot of money can be made with hedging. However, I am not saying my EA is amazing, I just say that it works under normal market conditions. The only real market condition it could not survive in backtesting is the global recession period.

Having said this, I think there is more money to be made in non-grid EAs if you can get it right. I am currently working on one at the moment. But as far as grid EAs, it is not to boast my own, but I simply just feel that it is among the safest grid EAs I have seen with the proper settings.

Welcome!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #567 ---
i tend to disagree with this eheh there are a lot of non grid thread here but very few are live tracked over a decent period of time..

another proof of this is: give a look at mql5.com signal with more than 12month of history tracked.. there are very few of them there too.. hehehe

switched to piggy 4.2 and running smoothly again

Maybe I can surprise you when I'm done with my next EA. The DD is not brilliant but the profitability is stupendous!

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I put this ea on experts, scripts and indicators-  nothing work. what is going wrong?

--- 帖子 #570 ---
i am the fan of the grid EA trading too.

Have been reading the thread over the weekend, drop by to say well done!! going to try the v4.2 now.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Great, can't wait to test your new EA. Is the EA that you make with semafor?

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I am friendly, in case you did not catch that one. Here are my HELPFUL replies.

Really? And where are those WORKING grids? Why don't we know about them? Maybe they are not public or maybe there are? Interesting. Show me some, please.

That is correct. Still, without the TIME FACTOR, it is a pure gamble to trade just one grid. It is not just using a grid, because there are multiple layers of grids. Let me help you. It is TIME and GRIDS.

I was trying to be helpful. Just wanted to do it in such a way where you would remember and not miss my remarks. I did it right, but you are somehow avoiding the TIMING and the MULTIPLE grids correlation...

I sincerely wish you good luck. I hope that you can make it. Here is a real friendly free advice. Use hedge. 99% with LIMIT orders. 1% with STOP orders. And you are there. Timing is the most important thing in forex. Adapt to it. Let the chart lead your way. Do not create frames, so the chart fits into the frames you created (one grid), because that is not gonna work one day (sooner rather than later). It is exactly THE OTHER WAY AROUND it. By now you should feel something from my words. I just do not want to type it directly in here...

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Of course there are successful grids. As there are profitable gamblers making fortune on gambling. How about the majority, the rest of us? It is exactly the same in forex... A single grid will really work only for the special people. And if you give it to all the rest, trust me, from 1 to just 20 out of 100 will use it successfully. This will make the winning grid based strategy... unpopular.

This is very easy, actually. Just start counting the stop losses on your favorite grid and you will then know, quite early, when there is going to be a range. You will be surprised when you see how the numbers show what your eyes cannot detect and see, but it is there in their focus-bogus charts...

hi daniel,

if i am running in vps (which desktop time is different from broker server time), how do i select LocalTime or server time?

and what will happen if it pass the end time and there is still active trades? how's the EA react?

--- 帖子 #575 ---
hi all, trying to understand how to properly use basket manager. can someone shed some light on the question below?

--- 帖子 #576 ---
as i said before you just got one of them here! and don't be fooled by the ''oh just another grid'' cause those who manage long and short side of the grid as a single trade are few and this is the main ingredient of the success of the grid

also i guess that i found a way to dramatically improve profit and DD but it looks like i'm the only one who like the idea

read my post here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...10#post8903810

could you please explain a little bit further what you mean when you talk about time? talking about strong trending market on some pairs, high spread or news trading with a grid?

i also missed the grid correlation.. as far as i can tell you can consider all the trades you got open as part of the core logic of the grid so for me there is only one grid and its own way to deal trades running

also don't forget that this grid don't leave behind open trades in a loss for hunderds and hundreds of pips like most of the others, and doing so long and short size are pretty much always in a tight range ( from first to last trade max range i saw in a week in 100pips on gbpjpy )

last but not least, i was friendly too ahaha just trying to make you notice that you must believe in forex, in yourself and that is possible to find the exit from this maze..

just need an outrageous amount of determination, willpower and patience eheh

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I've seen many EA's like this. The big question is: How does this EA handle the eventual (and inevitable) death trade?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
That one is also simple. To avoid the grids, the mathematicians that stay behind the forex market software (it is a software with rules, if(s) and else(s)) are forced to create multiple grids. And the total number of grids, within  day (any period of 24 hours), can and it is very close to: 1440 (M1) + 288 (M5) + 96 (M15) + 48 (M30) + 24 (H1) + 6 (H4) = 1,902 possible grids. This is just to confuse you a little bit. Obliviously, most of the traders are missing that moment.

The next very important thing is to determine what is trend and what is range. How do you do that? Range is about 80-85% of all time on the chart. Seriously outperforming the trend in the meaning of TIME.

What happens within a range?

It is a big party taking place. Stop Loss collection they call it. DD is called by the others who hedge THE WRONG WAY (with stop orders).

Do you know how many pips are within an average D1 candle on the pair you are trading?

I hope you do. Lets say GBPJPY has around 160 pips from top to bottom on a D1 candle.

Do you know how many pips there in the other candles?

I do doubt you are aware of that. Here is a little help, from a friend.

H4 has ~450 pips in a D1 160 pips candle.

H1 has ~1060 pips in a D1 160 pips candle.

M30 has ~1,350 pips in a D1 160 pips candle.

M15 has ~1,850 pips in a D1 160 pips candle.

M5 has ~3,150 pips in a D1 160 pips candle.

M1 has ~5,750 pips in a D1 160 pips candle.

Trending, does not exist, in reality. It is to TRICK YOUR EYES. It is a delusion. Ranging is the one and only market condition.

I do know you will say I am probably stupid and nuts. I agree, you will be absolutely right on that one! I have an IQ of 75 (below the average of 90) + I am aware I am probably stupid. But it takes a special kind of stupidness, to see what I am showing you here now. And the most of all, the road you are about to walk, I am just getting back from there. I wish you can find something different than the thousands who walked it already, but it is highly unlikely. Why? Because a lot smarter guys than me had been walking it and got the right conclusion. There are no winning grids. They did not know why there are no winning grids (long term). Picking 1 out of 1,900 possible is the reason, they were not consciously aware of.

The direction of the move, the tiny 160 D1 pips, which takes 5.5k pips on M1 to make, creates the correlation in between ALL the 1,900 REAL D1 grids created by the charts, within a day, and the exact moment of time, when the major part of these funny 160 D1 pips take place.

Time is the one and only single most important factor in forex. Everything is in a correlation with time. Think simple. Think that way. Disrespect timing and you are gone... All the best money management, all the best strategies will not be able to save your ass. And that moment of time will come closer than you had ever imagine it. Timing is everything...

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hello Daniel,

I have an idea to improve the EA. Check the picture that I attached here and let me explain.

The EA works perfectly with retracements, but how we can avoid big killer trend? -

Well my idea is this:

The EA have great results when we have laterally period because EA close Buys and Sells when 100 pips are reached and we have some kind of wave, for example price go up....close first all the buys...retracement going down...then close all the sells....retracement up...again close all the buys and maybe you reach your target.

What if the EA detects two or three consecutives close of trades groups? like this:

for example price go up close first all the buys...retracement going down...then close all the sells.... price going down more no retracement...again close all the new Sells...price going down more no retracement...EA close again the new sell trades.

My suggestion is, when EA detects this consecutives group closes maybe he can use the profit (only profit no capital) of the consecutives closes to close the most lossing trades and reduce the DD.

Tell me if you understand my idea, english is not my first language.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
hi timmy, just want to let you know one more person is interested on your thought. have been trying hard to figure out how the "dual system" could remove the toxic trades. In order to fully understand what you say, I use below example:

Assuming grid is 5pip

1.1000 Open 2 Sell

(Price goes down 5pip)

1.0095 Closed 1 Sell, Move 1 Sell to BE

(price goes up 5pip)

1.1000 Open 2 Buy (Note: 1 sell @ BE, will automatic closed @ BE)

(price then goes down)

Am interested to know how the Dual system, remove the 2 Buy toxic?

--- 帖子 #581 ---
ahahaha i like you  you use a divergent thinking process, outside of the box  and it is very important in forex to think what others don't

anyway i'm well aware of the concept of ATR and every strategy should be based on that parameter ( not sure you were referring at that )

you are never gonna see me trading an half pip grid like some guys do on Remon thread HAHA

anyway if i guess right you are saying that a grid works only if you can get the lucky entry point where the grid its gonna later build up around it

yeah perhaps its true but it is a parameter out of control.. i'm aware than for a few pips i could miss a partial close that later could bring to blow up the account

but i believe that changing the entry point its not so important if you use the right money managment and low risk profile

i mean, if missing a partial close in profit could save my life i'm probably trading a too tight grid.. in fact my goal and our goal its to find setting that works months after months, just avoiding high impact news periods...

anyway, gonna prove you wrong this time buddy ehehe

get ready cause i'm ready to improve this thing onto a monster capable to survive in the worst and most avverse condition.. be sure of it eheheh

--- 帖子 #582 ---
If I remember correctly, 4xpipaholic has been using a grid-based system for years profitably now. He is on this forum aswell (High-impact member). I don't know which system he uses though, since it was just something I read casually while browsing through the forums.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Likewise, Kunay9!

I do know how your system works and to be honest you have my credit for that. One way to improve it substantially is to face the hedged trades against each other, rather than position them from their backs. It is not so big improvement, cause it is in a grid... but that will have some positive impact and it is always better to face-to-face the hedged trades rather than to back-to-back them instead.

I have been testing piggy v4 from 14th of April. Results and set file attached. Quite impressive if one is willing to be patient during draw down phase.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hello shiva,

You leave 24hrs/5 days the piggy working?

and the .Set file is the same for GBPJPY and USDJPY?

--- 帖子 #586 ---
After 11 days account 2 gave up. I planned to reduce the equity profit percentage but I forgot because I broke my leg so was more interested on my health.

Anyway my conclusion is equity profit with small percentage will be profitable for this system. Others using 2% will still have chance to get out of toxic trades. I will stop posting for a while but will follow the thread closely.

Cheers guys.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hi Invermac, yes, 24/5 and same set file. You'll see some lot sizes were inconsistent, that was because to start with I fiddled around a bit with that.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hello Tundex,

My account loss so much today too, not broke but this 2% today not reached, let's see if anybody can improve the EA. Take care of your leg friend.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Ok I will follow your settings, looks very interesting like you say, just have a little patient.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Without seeing screenshots of your chart and EA settings, I am guessing that you did not hit a round number according to your settings to have a trade open.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Welcome !

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Yes, it is the one using the 3 Level ZZ Semafor but it will be the version without the Stream ZZ indicator. I believe this will be much better, I just need to tidy up a few things before I post it to FF in my other thread.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
You simply need to type in the box "server" or "local" whichever one you wish to use.

As far as time passing? I am not 100% sure because I have not used the function but I believe it will stop functioning in all manners. No new trades will be opened and currently opened positions will just run without having a TP. Although I am not 100% sure, I don't think it will manage its last trades open.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I think I understand what you are saying. There is a difficulty in the programming of getting the EA to have sells manage buys and buys manage sells when the existing structure does what it is doing. I so would like to get this EA to be able to change modes according to conditions and am unsure how I am going to do it. I think I have lost a little bit of focus on the improvement of this EA due to my work on the 2nd EA I am developing. I will try to dedicate some time and see if I can do something about this. I think what you are suggesting is possible, it just might take a bit of time. I am not sure...

Thanks for this input!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I just want people to know that I have not ignored Tim's thoughts on grid trading. I have tried to program what he was talking about but have not been successful. The best attempt to do anything close to what he was saying is to change the lot size to set your buy lots in step up to 0.02 and sell lots in step down to 0.02 when leaving the hedged side to 0.01. Maybe another programmer wants to have a crack at what Tim said? I'm sorry to be unable to do this myself.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Hope you have a fast recovery!

--- 帖子 #597 ---
good morning, I have a few days testing this EA so similiar to tundex, but with a grid of 10 pips.

-grid 10 pips.

-TP 100pips

-lots 0.01

-Close all when equitity 10%

EA today carries 200 pips (from 154.5 to 156.5) rise against and keep holding on, I think a way to survive would be for example, when it comes to -2000pips (top right pipsometre observe currently in -3954) doubled the purchase ordendes increasing the size to 0.02, thus even a little balance.

The EA would execute Sells 0.01, and 0.02 Buys until you reach the daily equitity (10%) once it back to normal.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Doubling up the buying size would mean nothing but not opening the sell order (2+1-1 = 2), it would just eat your margin faster. Here comes the avoid-the-trend parameter.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Thanks. I forgot to mention that Monday market is also something to watch out for. Out of the 11 days the highest DD was noticed on Monday market. I still believe small percentage will survive.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Thanks @keydcuk.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I'm not going to attach this to post #1 until there is more conclusive evidence in its positive use but here is an attempt at closing negative bucket trades quicker.  I have added a feature that is called "Trade Count Switch". This is the amount of trades that are currently open strictly counting only buys and only sells. I am currently testing the switch at 6 open buys or 60 open sells When trades are = or greater than this number, it will trigger additional trades at the lot you desire in the buy when grid step up and sell in grid step down mode, Currently I have default settings of an additional 0.02 lots which are there in my preferred GBPJPY 200 pip grid setup Trades will still open a buy/sell as per normal only additional lots are triggered under circumstances

I don't know whether this will actually be useful for those who are using the tight grid and equity method of trading. I have tried it briefly in backtest but obviously it is the forward test that will determine whether it is useful as you are stopping the EA from running when equity hits and I still have no equity function in my EA

I think the key to this one would be to study the micro and macro moves and average out the conditions in which the switch could be used when an average macro move takes place.

Have Fun!

Daniel

today my small demo account was blown over 2700 pips not positive, this means that i will step aside, i would have to see more positive news here before giving it another try, too bad as i had hoped to have found something good, i wish all best of luck, i really appreciate all input here

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Not pushing you to do anything but it would be interesting to know what is the grid size you are using? Your would likely not have blown the account with a larger sized grid.

Quick insight at what the settings are going to look like on Piggy_MOD which is a reworked version (from scratch) of the EA, full of new settings and filters such as the ability to use pending orders, basket trailing, dynamic money management and scaling options... and much more.

A stable release can be expected around the end of the week as unfortunately I work on many other projects aside

Keep in mind that the very idea of this version is to anhilate the DD through trend / cycles recognition

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hello Daniel, i think you are correct my crazy gridstep was 15 pips, i struggle to find a combination that works well for me, maybe double or triple the gridsize, but also statements on gridtrading never works did have an effect. I will setup with other settings tomorrow and see how that goes, thanks for your suggestion.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi again,

last Friday Piggy done over 100 USD and today if i stop around 1h ago again 100 USD. I am playing on demo still and removed US500 so only DAX.

However today DD was over 100% for few minutes. [ account is 2200 USD ]

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Excellent! Thank you VERY MUCH for your contributions!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Looking forward to have a play with this coders version of Piggy n The Middle...

...but in the meantime, here is another version called v4-2b.

In this version I am hoping to achieve reducing DD by telling the EA to stop entering buy sell positions at a given number of buys and a given number of sells set by the user. Trust me when I say this... " Because we are telling the EA not to enter the hedge positions, it is more difficult to close buckets on retracement. For this reason and after testing this to prove it to myself, it is absolutely necessary to but buy in up grid and sell in down grid step heavier." My current default settings are no more than 10 buys or 10 sells independently and it will remove the hedged positions and only buy up and sell down. If there are not 10 of each buys and sells, it will still hedge as buys and sells are ran independently still.

Not worthy of a post 1 EA until proven useful.

Have Fun!

Daniel

Why I don't see all of this EA?

Hi Happytrade38,

So now your logic identifies that you have two buy trades open and can clear these with four steps down on the grid.

1.1000 Open 2 Buy

1.0095 Open 2 sell positions

1.0090 Open 2 sell positions (close 1 sell on previous step, 1 to BE when this step down opens)

1.0085 Open 2 sell positions (close 1 sell on previous step, 1 to BE when this step down opens)

1.0080 Open 2 sell positions (close 1 sell on previous step, 1 to BE when this step down opens. Also here EA closes all positions in four steps above for break even on the sequence)

So here EA logic identifies buy positions can be neutralised and eliminates them for no loss. All done within 20 pips move.

Of course your EA logic could state that when two "dangler trades" are identified (ie the 2 buy trades at 1.1000 and then price reverses down) then it does not close one of the sell positions as it moves down until the loss on the dangler positions are overcome.

This would look like the following:

1.1000 Open 2 Buy

1.0095 Open 2 sell positions

1.0090 Open 2 sell positions (2 to BE when next step down opens)

1.0085 Open 2 sell positions (2 to BE when next step down opens. Also here EA closes all positions in three steps above for break even on the sequence)

And price carries on now looking for that nice 100 pip move with,say, 15* 5 pip steps in a row heading down and makes a nice profit.... and leaves you with a mother load of open sell steps to use in the future to remove dangler trades and to automatically eliminate these in a similar fashion to how Remon does it... but more efficiently.

You have the luxury of really creating any logic tactics for your EA as you wish since once this baby gets rolling you can have many positions at BE over time and with a consistent move down or up.  For example the continued move down may leave 6 sell positions at BE - now your programmed logic may now say - 'when I get dangler positions after 6 reserve BE positions I will use these to eliminate them immediately after two reverse steps in a row and override the close out methods mentioned above until I run out of reserve sell trades at BE. There are many ways you can make it work efficiently ..... get it.... imagine having 15 reserve positions all at BE.... they would have a massive cumulative number of open steps that can be used to eliminate dangler trades!!

The key is to eliminate the range trading dangler trades efficiently whilst waiting for the nice trend moves.  The system profit comes from the continuous incremental profit taking of the first positions NOT the reserve BE positions.  (although you could harvest these for profit if you got over, say, 20 BE positions.... again another logic rule for your EA)

Personally I wouldn't use 5 pips steps - but if you want to set your EA logic to favour trends then smaller step gaps would create many more frequent "trends" (think about it: 100 pip step means you need a 1000 pip move for a 10 step "trend", but a 5 pip step means you only need a 100 pip move for a 10 step trend - which is going to come along more often for the trending bias grid.)

Hope that helps.

Tim

Sorry, somehow I have missed this post and only found it by accident.

Please find the attached for your request. However, I struggle to understand as you only mention one time period above in your post. I don't know why you want 2 time filters. Anyway. here it is just for you

--- 帖子 #613 ---
is "server" refer to broker server time and "local" refer to desktop time?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
So now your logic identifies that you have two buy trades open and can clear these with four steps down on the grid.

1.1000 Open 2 Buy

1.0095 Open 2 sell positions

1.0090 Open 2 sell positions (close 1 sell on previous step, 1 to BE when this step down opens)

1.0085 Open 2 sell positions (close 1 sell on previous step, 1 to BE when this step down opens)

1.0080 Open 2 sell positions (close 1 sell on previous step, 1 to BE when this step down opens. Also here EA closes all positions in four steps above for break even on the sequence)

At this stage, float loss of 2 buy is 2 x 5pips x 4 steps =- 40pips; and the gain of  1 sell of 15pips gain (from price 1.0095) + 10pips gain (from price 1.0090)  + 5pips gain (from price 1.0085) = + 30pips.  Net is - 10 pips if we closed all positions in four steps down from "Open 2 Buy". Is my understanding correct?

--- 帖子 #615 ---
hello Keydcuk!

thanks for the update

am i doing something wrong?

i set max order to 10 x side but there 50more sells open

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hi Daniel,

that's great as I was thinking of something on the same line.

I was wondering if it would be possible to set a range rather than a number of orders, meaning an upper limit for buys and a lower limit for sells. This would be very helpful for applying different strategies. It can still be done by multiplying the n. of trades by the grid distance, however it wouldn't be as good.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Great work Edorenta, look forward to checking it out.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hi,

From where did you get this EA? It has been made based on Remon Part 1 Idea as it mentioned in the EA. I am just curious to know who made it.

Thanks

Mohsen

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
You still need it to sell and buy. The Max Trades is (Before it goes into buy only up and sell only down mode.)

--- 帖子 #621 ---
When you say different strategies... you're clearly thinking of something are you not? Please share your ideas. I will try anything that I am capable of programming. I have got a lot of time on my hands and only post what can work well in post #1. I don't mind having a load of different versions so long as I organize the best ones in post 1 to not confuse new followers or those who don't read the entire thread.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
yeah i get that but max trades was 10.. if i get it right if there are more than 10long or 10 short than the EA will stop opening those long or short trades and trade the side with less trades right?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
You are right,

Since the main issue is how we deal with trends, I think we need to establish first how we can identify one. I think PA is the best way to achieve that, so when I saw Invermac pic about the group of trades, I've realized that on the higher TF that would be an inside bar. Then yesterday I run the EA on my demo account and I was lucky enough to get a perfect example of inside bar group of trades. The second picture is from today, same thing. Those are 30min candles by the way.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Especially the one from today it shows that I could run the standard grid within the previous candle range, then switch to only BUY/SELL outside the range and avoid possible DD. Leaving the EA running in standard mode outside the range would probably mean losing the 200 pips.

Now, is this going to be perfect? Most likely not, however I think it's much better than running the EA without considering PA at all. In the long run if it helps 50% of the time, it's going to make a huge difference in terms of DD.

Also the inside candle strategy is not the only one you can use. It can easily work on breakouts, S/R, ATR range and ZigZag strategy with a single side option. Alternatively you let the EA working within the range only.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #624 ---
you guys just don't like a grid that will trade alone self adapting to market condition??

no link between grid style and PA like inside bars.. solution to the puzzle its much easier ( to code and apply )

no need to overcomplicate things

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I'm very interested, if you please could explain how the EA is going to identify market conditions, then how the EA will trade in different market conditions it would help.

Anyway having a grid in a range rather than a grid that runs like mice on a wheel doesn't look that complicated to me, actually quite the opposite.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #626 ---
again today looks ok if Piggy stops now.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
No. Look at it again. The sell positions after 4 steps equal 45 pips (don't forget the second sell trades that close at the next step) versus the two buys at -40 pips. So clean out time for the dangler trades as price action ranges and we move on to await the trend action. No indicators, just a grid with governing logic, price action, and time.

It's not perfect by any means as some scenarios will require step profits to be used up to clean up dangler positions under some range patterns. This is especially so for tight grids (but their advantage is that if they get more trend periods - by definition - so they require less movement to get a number of reserve positions at BE). But once you get a good clean move in one direction then you gain reserve positions at BE that allow other logic steps to kick in to clean up danglers.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
if you read from page 24 you fill find the answer yourself  just let the ea decide when trade and when not trade and when go long or go short

no need to use equity managers or indicators or PA

Hi Daniel,

thank you very much for sharing your source code. I backtest it in an M5 and I would like to share the result pic with you, lotsize 0.01, 10.000 start. The DD is about 3.200 max., I would say between Feb. und May 2013 is the problem.

Net prof 1.070,  brutto 3.350, loss 2.280

Thanks for your test.

I am wondering if a 5 minute timeframe is accurate enough to test this system? A profit of roughly 10% in 3 years time with a drawdown of 30% does not sound too good and contradicts to other reports in this thread.

What alerted me is thehorizontal scale, where it shows only about 250 trades were executed (If I interpret correctly). This is much different than the other screenshots I see where many many many trades are opened each day.

Hi Egosuma,

I am only guessing ... a better answer could give Daniel ... with this set up it is 0.01 lotsize and the TP is around 10,00 USD as I used the default values of the EA, just out of the box ... with an different TP, lotsize or Gridsize it could produce a different and better result or be killed ... but I am waiting for Daniels opinion to get an better answer. This test just shows that the EA could survive in an long distance with an defensive use, the real Problem in my opinion is the 3-4months range of DD. If be used more agressive it might bring other/better/worser result in a long backtest. Honestly, I tested very plenty of EAs 3-4 years backtest and only few survived, this is one of it and I guess it can be improved/ is worth to be improved, just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Because there is no indicators involved and real tick dependent conditions due to a wide grid, you will get nearly the same results on a 5min than in tick mode is my opinion. The thing is, this is a brilliant EA with exception to 1-2 times a year when there is trend with little retracement. Another FF member backtested this from 2008 and found a similar DD. I ran this one from 2000 and there is even more DD. I don't know what to think about this. The EA is ok but who wants to be $3000 or £3000 in DD??? I am still thinking of better ways to make grid trading work but I am limited to having no coding skills and the fxdreema program limitations. It is a tough call. I've got an idea in mind but I don't know how I would make it work. I'm not going to discuss it just yet.

I know in Remon's grid thread, there was a version of APG 4 that had an MA filter and some members were making it work I believe. It will be interesting to see the coders version of Piggy n The Middle that is coming and see what the optional filters will bring to the game.

Cheers!

Dear Coders,

I would like to work with the attached indicator but I've got a problem. There is only a SELL signal buffer which is buffer 0 and blue. There is no other buffers I can access for the BUY signal which is red.

Can someone help me out with this minor modification?

Thanks for your attention,

In HFT (High Flying Trading) thread the Captain mentioned using SMA34 on H4 as a directional bias...

It might worth to give a shot to avoid these major DDs...

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Well, I got 3 situations with this one. I either cannot get it to keep a £1000 account for more than 5 months starting from year 2000 or I can make it fly by a year for making about £50-£75 in the first year.

The first scenario is when I program the EA to buy only in up steps when MA is set at 34 on 4H chart.

It blows the £1000 account in less than 5 months.

The second scenario is when I tell it that if above 34MA only buy up and nothing on the down and if below 34MA only sell and nothing on the up.

It makes about £50-£75 in the first year

The third scenario I am telling it no matter what, look at the grid step and buy if above 34MA and sell if below 34MA

It blows the £1000 account in less than 5 months.

I have left scenario 1 as an example and left TF and MA variable options but I have tried different TFs and it's pretty much the same.

Feel free to throw any ideas out there. If I can program it, I will try it!

Daniel

I crunched the numbers today myself. Ran tick-based backtest over 2012 - 2016, with an initial balance of 50.000 and the settings posted by Togerhard for Piggy n The Middle v4-2a.mq4 :

You were right, Max drawdown is roughly the same, 2,5k.

On the other side, the gain is only about 1k, over a 4 year period.

1k profit with 2,5k drawdown does not sound nice to me.

I'll keep testing and see if i can help improve.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
How about REVERSING the entries, using current TP as SL, and setting a $1k/$2k TP...?

Naturally one would have to observe prolonged periods of small losses, but the rare occasional HUGE PROFITS would generously compensate for them...

interesting idea, but :

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Sorry MG, revised version of v4c. Just goes to show me that one little overlook and the EA does do what it's meant to do.

The previous version WASN'T CLOSING BUYS!!!!

Anyway, this one wasn't so bad... it crashed at end 2008... To no surprise, it was global recession!

--- 帖子 #642 ---
The interesting thing about this is that I tested 100 pip grid on the same pair and it only crashes around the same period and makes about an extra £2k+ over the period.

This just goes to show you it is really not as much the EA is bad, it is just there are some conditions in which grid EAs cannot trade. I think the only way forward with this is to identify conditions that tell the EA to close everything, not trade or change modes of trading. I would love to get an EA that knows when to trade grid and when not to but as far as I'm concerned it's not as easy as just to say grid in range and do something else in trend. These are not easy things to technically define when the future has not happened on a chart.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hi everyone,

I've been sitting on the side lines watching this thread for a while now - very interesting. Thanks to everyone who has contributed.

I thought I'd share a way to avoid some of the directional issues - I notice some talk of using the Moving Average which is good to use for closing out trades if they are in the negative - ie, if the candle has broken a 50 EMA and continues to climb for example after 3 bars, close all the shorts and go the other way until such time the candles close below the 50EMA.

Another that works VERY well that no one has mentioned yet... is the Ichimoku ... It's one of the most powerful indicators to use.

Before I get into that -- I was reading from the link from the first post here, and noticed this video

Inserted Video

Is this EA based on that because I don't quite see it working that way? Is this EA slightly different to that of the video? Reason I ask is that I the most recent version only closing out longs, for example, and not closing out any shorts from profits made from longs. I applied the EA to the chart, its made over 1500 pips, but its over 12000 pips in negative for the GBP/JPY, with settings of Take profits of 25 pips each way with a round numbers detector set to 5... .. Can someone shed some light on that for me... Thanks.

re: the Ichimoku . to get a really good impression of where the trend is going to go... we can use 5M or any other time frame that's higher.

ie.

When Senkou Span A Crosses above Senkou Span B.. prepare for longs - close out any shorts that are open and or wait for the EMA Angle smoothing element OR wait for a equilibrium break

When Senkou Span B Crosses above Senkou Span A.. prepare for shorts - close out any longs that are open and or wait for the EMA Angle smoothing element OR wait for a equilibrium break

Best regards,

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Thank you for your input. I always wanted to get into Itchimoku but never really got the whole thing. I will have a look at this and see what I can do.

As far as Remon's video and strategies, it is not as much that it is like Remon's strategy as it is inspired by his strategy. The main thing that this EA does that Remon's does as well is that it takes profit in retracement or at least Method 1 does. Because of my inability to program with fxdreema buys taking care of sells in a fashion of removing specific losers, I never got to do this in my EA. However, I think that my method is equally as powerful or at least close by just eliminating all the toxic trades at once during the retracement period. I thought I made it clear that my method does not replicate anywhere near what Remon's methods do but I am very thankful and grateful for his thread and posts as it has inspired me to get to where I am in EA building.

As far as your settings, it would seem that the EA is only proven successful so far in 2 different ways. Either you can use a very wide grid like the default settings of 200 pips away or you can try the method Tundex posts as he runs it next to an equity trade manager along side this EA in a tight grid but closes everything for the day at a set equity profit and trades again after the London open move.

Welcome! & Happy Pipping!

Daniel

AM I GOING OVERBOARD HERE?

It seems I have not paid attention to Piggy n The Middle EA for a while and I am trying my best to give you all I got here.

Here is a very interesting version that both normal traders and tight grid traders might find useful.

The grid size round numbers sorts itself out according to daily ATR and the factor you choose to multiply it with.

In test, I thought I was going to find better results by keeping the ATR high and use something like factor 3 or 4 to lower the DD. In instances this is somewhat true in the highest degree but pulls no real profit to talk about. Soooooo???? I recommend that if you want to use it in a regular fashion, ATR multiplier 0.5 backtests very well from 2000 - 2016 with the exceptions of end year 2008 and year 2009 due to the global recession period.

Use it if you will, if not then don't

I like this one. There might be something in it for furthering a strategy to combat its current drawbacks.

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Hi Daniel... thanks for the reply.

What are the intervals for the round number detector in regards how far apart the trades are opened? I was understanding that if I set it to 5, it would open trades 5 pips apart from each other (at least that's what I'm observing), while the BUY_Trades_Take_Profit_In_PIPS / SELL_Trades_Take_Profit_In_PIPS set to 10, and when the TP is hit, it will close them out (obviously ~ however I've seen that when this number was reached, some trades were not closed out), then calculate the profit and remove some of it from the floating losses before it opens any more.

The setting I have it at... 10 pips BUY_Trades_Take_Profit_In_PIPS / SELL_Trades_Take_Profit_In_PIPS , with 5 set as the rounding number, has a floating loss of 13,000 (300 open trades) pips now, with a gain of 1600 pips... Sorry if this has been repeated before, I've read the posts over a few times and I still get the same notion I have now ~ maybe I'm missing something here?

Before posting this reply ~ took some time to go back to your main post and re-read your reply here. Is the grid the round number detector the Grid Distance's Low and High? Once price reaches the grid, it will then open new trades once its been touched by the price? And close out trades based on the BUY_Trades_Take_Profit_In_PIPS / SELL_Trades_Take_Profit_In_PIPS (I'm referring to the latest version 4.2), because I'm thinking that if its set to 200, it would only open a couple trades every other day since G/Y doesn't really move that much, well, no pair really moves over 200 pips in one day from its low to high.

BTW, have you tried to use StrategyQuant? I think you will find that most helpful ~ I believe they have a free trial available. I purchased it (EA Wizard), but I'm unable to use it as it confuses me to no end.

Best regards,

--- 帖子 #651 ---
You're still da bomb Saj, but here I only see buffers 0, 1 and 2. Buffer 0 is still the BLUE sell signal but I tried buffer 1 and 2 and neither of them trigger when I try a quick EA test. I see no -1 buffer. Can you help with this?

Thanks,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Yes, you are right in what you are saying... in a 200 pip environment, you will not get many trades. This is how the EA was initially setup until others played around with it. Now a days if you are using a tight grid, there is a method that Tundex is using which involves waiting for London open and start trading around 8:15am GMT. This way you are avoiding the trend which this EA struggles with. Then, when equity hits, you can use an equity manager to close all trades for the day and wait till the next day to trade. I attach this EA if you wish to try this out.

As far as the EA goes, it opens buy/sell positions on each grid step and takes profit where the user sets it. I personally set it mid way to the next grid step. In the large grid case, I find it useful as it takes profit and can miss opening another buy/sell so that it can retrace without leaving anything open at the top or bottom. When it retraces, it looks at the P/L and converts this money amount in a pip value and closes at the pip TP set in the EA. Depending on positions open, this can be anywhere from about 1/3 retrace to 3/4 position. 3/4 position is more assuming there is only 2 or 3 positions to retrace to hit the TP.

I hope this is clear.

Yes, I have looked at Strategy Quant before. I thought I was going to be impressed with it as when I seen the information and watched videos, it made sense in my head. Upon demoing it, I was less than impressed. Maybe there is something I missed when evaluating it? I don't know. I am normally not an indi person as my background of trading is more or less naked charts. I am only using indicators as I a have an interest in building EAs. Having said that, the only 2 EAs that I built don't really use indicators or at least not in the original form. My only real addition is this latest ATR grid size changing version 4-2d. My other EA simply in development, nothing really big yet, uses as principle a 3 level ZZ Semafor indicator. Yes, it is an indicator but I only use it because it is the closest thing I can use to replicate real wave movements by defining HH and LL as well as the mid points where things zig and zag swings high and low or makes breaks. It's not easy because it repaints but I believe I am getting somewhere with it. I have lots of time on my hand at the moment and am striving to get an indicator that trades like a manual trader does without indicators but by using indicators as ironically as this sounds. My quest continues...

If you have any input for anything, or have an EA idea, please feel free to post here or PM me. I am eager to collaborate with anybody who has a clear idea.

Thanks,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Thanks Daniel,

EA Wizard is the one you want to try out. StrategyQaunt is for indicators... EA Wizard has been revamped as of late (according to an email update I got recently)... It has most of the StrategyQuant features, as well as the ability to use raw price candle action HLOC strategies (I know quite a lot actually that are effective)... sure, I'll send you a PM at some point and let you assess as your time permits - I like simple approaches to be honest, using the K.I.S.S. method seems to work out better than these complicated ones. I have an EA that works very well, with over 35,000 lines of code in it  But it took way too long to build and tweak...lol

I'll check the file out and I'll get back to you with a few strategies I use, and be more than happy to let you share with everyone here too.

Thanks once again, keep up the good work

Sir, I think i am not exactly getting what you need. But don't feel the pain. You are doing a great job. Always feel free to inbox me. If you just need the buy and sell signal.

well, if you read from page 24 you fill find that almost everybody is whinging about trendy markets. You just need to play a few days on Remon's simulator to understand that it takes the slightest variation to change any grid results from Good to Bad and Bad to Worse.

Anyway I was only checking if it was possible to have a fix grid range rather than a fix number of trades, nothing crazy.

Thanks for your effort. The reason I was trying to capture both signals is because there is a period this indicator goes through where there is no buy or no sell signal. I tell you what, I will experiment with the signal I got and if I find it useful and need the other buffer, I will let you know.

I tried a couple of different ways to incorporate a SL system with this and have not been successful. The reason for this is because I am working with a group of trades rather than individual ones. I can only suggest that you use a trade management EA on a different chart next to your trading.

However, it is of my opinion that using a SL will not get you any better using this system as grid trading always brings DD and it would be difficult to set a value in which a working SL would be profitable for your trading.

If I could do it, I would have have. Maybe it will be different in the coders version of this EA soon to come.

Daniel

Sorry, I don't mean to confuse people with all my different versions being posted. Basically all versions that are being posted in the thread are experimental except with what I put in post #1. If there is anything that is worth keeping and advertising as being stable, I will update post #1. As for the other versions, they are for experimenting and development.

Hi Daniel,

all good mate, I jumped the gun on that.

Just to clarify, ROUND NUMBERS either Pips or Grid Size, are referring to n. of pips between grid levels on all versions?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Well, as far as the most recent version on post #1 and the last few pages of the thread, yes.

There was a beginning of v4 where I was working round numbers as a price value of the currency pair traded which was a bit confusing for some. Thanks to Guilherme, it was pointed out that I could still have a round numbers block as a fixed pip value rather than to look at price and fractional decimal points.

Cherss

--- 帖子 #678 ---
thanks for this EA.

I think a good option to reduce the DD and be prepared for a possible trend, would be that from a number of grid X, then the highest buy and sell were lower twice.

Example, we have several open trades between 156.2 and 156.7 have put a GRID of 5 pips, and GRID maximum of 50 pips with a lot of 0.01, which Sell is lowest at 156.2 and buy more high at 156.7, with the highest purchase will be 0.02 pips and the highest sales will be 0.02 pips, only the upper and lower orders, all other orders that occur between the grid will be 0.01.

would that be possible?

sorry for my bad english.

I would be very grateful if you could make changes. I attach an example:

--- 帖子 #683 ---
I'm currently testing the EA 4.2 on a small account 400e.

grid 10 pips

TP = 100pips

10% TP equitity

equitity SL 50%

run 09:30 (GMT) to close% and avoid major news days (tomorrow does not work)

in extreme situations I modified parameter BUY lot grid set UP to 0.02 and SELL lot grid set DOWN to 0.02 and EA has recovered.

that makes me think that the changes I have mentioned might help a little when it comes into trend ...

As said, I will have a look at this but I have not been very successful so far in having an increasing lot condition. I will see what I can do.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
This is one of the rare occasions that higher DD is better for long term profitability. I have backtested the 0.02/0.01 buy/sell and 0.01/0.02 sell/buy situation and long term it is more profitable to have a slightly larger DD for long term profitability. In most cases I have tested this would not be the case. This is an exception.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Today was a very good day for PIGGY on DAX, +413 points about triple the daily range, but I have to admit, that is not every dax the case. Usually I trade a similar strategy manually successfully on Renko charts. As you may notice on my renko chart below, there was a 50-point drop this afternoon with 14 bearish candles in a row.

In such a scenario I would not go long until the first bullish candle, but Piggy did three times. The problem with grid systems is the static grid distance in a trending market, as we all know.

I don't know, whether one can code this in Piggy, f.i. increasing the static distance, in my case on DAX 10-15 points, till to the next bullish/bearish 3-brick candle,

just an idea...of course applicable for currencies, as well.

I have 2 versions that are based on dynamic grid range. One is v4-2d which is based on daily ATR. I suppose I could modify so that the ATR reading can be done from different time frames. It is currently just daily. The other version I had created was an experimental version that opens at candle opens rather than have any other calculation. I found this version not very great. I had it opening on 4H, Daily, every 2-3 days and finally the weekly candle which I ramped the TP at 200 pips. This was ok ish but not really gone anywhere as it is not good on its own. This is vX1.

It would be easier for me if there is an indicator that can calculate a factor of dynamic distance as working with Renko can be a pain for EAs as they are offline charts and also people use different renko chart builders.

If you have a clear defined idea of something you want to try, feel free to give me clear details and I will at least try to program it.

Just thought I would share with you something to show you that you can still profit if you trade less winners than losers so long as you have good money management.

Even though a lot of the non-winning trades are trades that got stopped at a break even "0" pips, it still shows your that 22.29& profitable trades can still make money!

its completely useless to backtest an expert advisor during days with high impact news..

its obvious that every strategy will suffer during 100+pips moves..

you should also use at least 99,9% tick data and as usual most backtest don't go further than 90% ad even so backtests are unreliable, no matter the results

a savvy coder once told me that backtest are only usefull when you need to speedtest the correct functionality of an expert advisor

nothing more, nothing less

Cobra,

nice effort, but profit is depending on a trend being there on the day.

if not, the drawdown for your system in a ranging period can be very large, seeing that you raise your lot size every time the grid level is hit again.

so if price gyrates between +1 and -1 level 5 times your 5 buy orders at +1 level your lot size has increased to 0.1 - 0.2 - 0.3 - 0.4 and 0.5 lots and losses of $ 10 + 20 +30 + 40 + 50 = $ 150

the same for your sell orders at -1 = $ 150 loss.

also all the losses from the 0 level.

what is your reasoning for upping the lot size every time you hit a grid level again?

would it be smarter to raise the lot size only (if at all) when price moves out of a congestion zone?

would advise to use the EA on the worst choppy weeks in the last few years to see what you can expect in the future.

have you tried that? doubt the drawdown will ALWAYS be overcome quite frankly.......

imo there is no way to avoid slippage with small grid steps like 10 pips.

your grid system is clearly profitable only in trending conditons.

imo you need to minimize losses in ranging conditions for your system to be viable long-term.

also don't be married to one particular pair: one is ranging, another one might be trending.

timmy described a dual entry system for a trending grid in this thread.

did you have a look at that one?

good luck.

Hi,

What setting and version are you using?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #699 ---
i got questions what is my set, again here it is:

first DAX30:

grid 10 points / profit 5 / lot 0,02

second DAX30:

grid 11 points / profit 5 / lot 0,02

account 2200usd

so i am using two separate Piggys with different magic #

Hi Keydcuk, congratulations for the idea, although partly borrowed from Mr. Remon.

I think your intuition can be an excellent starting point to develop new and productive ideas on "grid systems".

I also use FxDreema to aggregate various algorithms, always based on the idea shared with Mr. Remon.

I ask you, if you can post the project "Fxdreema" in .xml format; so it would be easier for me to enter the various implementations that I think.

Thank you.

Time-frame = 15'

--- 帖子 #701 ---
could you tell me the piggy version and the set?

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Yeah, sure. If you let me know how to do this, I can do that for you. I don't know how to save as xml.

Hi Daniel,

Hope all is well.

I'm noticing something somewhat odd here. During my testing I'm seeing that longs are being closed off earlier before they hit the TP, yet, the shorts are not being closed at all when the conditions are the same as that of the longs.

e.g: shorts have traveled farther than the longs, yet the shorts do not get closed off and the shorts are just piling up not being closed off.

Is this a bug?

Best regards

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Hmmm... without knowing what settings you are using, let me just say that the default settings are set for 200 pip grid and 100 pip TP. This could be why you think there are trades taking profit early while the price is trending in a direction. Also, please be aware that the PIP value in TP is not based on actual pips but it looks at the profit/loss value of the group of buy or sells and converts it to a virtual pip value.

I am not sure what else to say about this. I have checked the configuration in the xml linked EA and it seems to be just the way it always ever was.

@keydcuk You are the man bro  your EA is a money making machine  I am newbie in Forex and was trying a lot of strategies but your EA simply blew me

@Carneiro Thanks for all the posts  I cannot describe how useful your posts are.

Now for the tests I have done till now.
I am using the v4-1 of the piggy EA on a demo account with GBPUSD, EURUSD and EURGBP pairs (using the settings what Carneiro provided). I haven't back tested, just let go the piggy on the mentioned pairs on demo for more than 24hrs now. I haven't even stopped it during high impact news as I am running it on demo to understand how it handles the PA after news.

Have to say, amazing results (its more than 24hrs run)...
Attached Image

Thinking of running it for a month and see how it holds (the same version 4-1).

If you ask me, I would not ask for any changes in the EA except for adding some equity management options so that the account doesn't get blown out. Still can't forget what happened to CHF.

I have some queries as well, which I am going to post later as I am jotting them down now.

Cheers and happy pips all the way

5 round number, 25 TP ...

if you say the TP is not actual pips, why would it say that in the settings? shouldnt it be TP in Equity instead?

oh, the TOTAL GROUPED VALUE of longs or shorts... that makes a lot more sense

thanks for clearing that up

Best Regards

--- 帖子 #715 ---
oh, as a suggestion Daniel?

Would it be ok if you could add a display panel of the current profit -/+ of the grouped pair's total. So we can visually see the grouped pair?

Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #716 ---
I mainly kept this in pips because it is much easier to make calculation on scenarios. By adding and subtracting pips instead of working off money values, you know exactly what it takes to close trades according to your grid size and number of positions open. For your situation, if you are using 5 pip grid with 25 pip TP, you know it will take exactly 3 positive grid steps to achieve your 25 pip TP, first position going up to position 3 and 2nd position going up to position 3 = 25 pips. Be aware that you are selling yourself short in this situation as when it comes to position 3, it might take profit after the 3rd position opens leaving you with only 1 sell position at that point in the uptrend scenario. This is why I prefer to set a TP at mid grid for these cases or 10 pips before grid size. This is in my case where I don't let my positions overlap as it leaves a constant open scenario and there is no case where there will be both buys and sells close. However, I think this advice can be given in the overlap conditions as well as if you are using even grid numbers, you may find that a buy/sell will not take place at the TP level if you know what I am saying

This is the main reason I have stayed away from TP in cash as you can think about these things in pips.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #717 ---
What i meant was in the INPUT section, it says PIPS, not Equity

So we should be using EVEN Round Numbers then? Not Even? Or Even TP's not Odd TP's?

Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #718 ---
It's up to you. All I am saying is if you use a TP that is a multiple of your grid size, in some cases when your TP hits, your next open position will not be hedged. As we never know what market does and especially if we are just using an EA, it is my opinion that you want the hedged position open. Therefore, I would set a TP at something like 23 pips or 27 pips so that it is not bang on a grid step multiple.

It's just a suggestion.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
now you have just confused me even more...

first you say a 5 round number and 25 TP will leave one trade open and not hedged...

now youre saying use 23 - 27, how does that divide into 5 to leave equal open trades on either side?

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I'm suggesting that it does not divide, that it is not a multiple of the grid steps.

I don't mean to confuse you. There is no need for complication. I kinda wish I never would have said anything to begin with.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
LOL

I was just confused by your 23-27 statement.

I understood the position 1, 2, 3 for the 25 TP, when position 2 and 3 reach 3 grids will close off with one trade left open and not being hedged, from using the 10 grid.. (25/10 = 2.5 ==> closing off 2, leaving .5 open).. so if I had 10 grid with 20 TP, things will be hedged, right, not leaving one trade exposed?

Sorry for the questions, just trying to understand it better so I can figure out good settings to share to everyone later on

Best regards,

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Dears,

today was hard for Piggy as margin call was touched for more than 2h  ; just after that DAX went up and both Piggys closed buy trades. 4,9% reached today.

Worth to say that before this I had a clear moment to stop Piggy with 100 USD profit but wanted to see more for today.

I think i start using Piggy live next week Tuesday.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hi, the more safer is the trade time. I came up to this after few tests. A fra or lo open for few hours seems to be enough shows me better stability..However I did not demo it as long as many of you here. Secondly I prefer another EA on another chart to have a hard SL adjusted, in case to protect me from possible big moves. There are some hidden days to pass from big DD...Dax is driving sometimes like a Ferrari and I need to consider this always.. But calm days seems very effective..

Thank you jdva,

this week was great, also yesterday it managed well. Maybe trading time was good adjuasted. I have another problem. I use version v4-2  and it opens only long positions ..But on backtests I see many short positions...Is there a problem on the EA, or do I need to use another version?

This week all days were winner..Any advise why I have only long positions on DAX?

--- 帖子 #739 ---
you should get long and short trades, I'm using the same version 4-2 and it works flawlessly. Look in your setup whether everything ist okay...

Are you using the default settings?

Also could someone tell me what the "magic" number really is / represents?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #741 ---
still testing various settings, currently on DAX 12 points grid step/6 p. TP...but I have to input in Piggy settings 1200/600 for that.

magic number is the ID of EA, you can ignore it when trading different symbols on charts...

--- 帖子 #742 ---
hmm..I do not know why, but today and yesterday, I had only long trades...interesting...all is default except the time of the trade, ı trade from FRA+10 min till after max+5 hours....same version...upss ....Next week I have to check closer the problem as the week is over. But my EA setup is clearly correct adjusted...

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Maybe yours is another version... my is only V4-2, no a-b-c-d versions... In example I do not have adjustable grid step settings...Maybe thats why my is only open long , hmmm

--- 帖子 #744 ---
no...I have definitely v4-2, no additional characters, in the last line of Piggy settings (below time settings) you should find "RoundNumber Pips" for grid step input..

Thanks for your answer. Only today have I found this thread. Tried using the V4 on GBPJPY with grid set to 0.05, which would translate into 5 pips in V4-2 I think?

) thanks...so its same all, I will look forward again next week with another broker and higher lot size evt. the balance, (this week with test balance of 300 and lot size 0.01 it handled very well over %20)...PLease can you correct me about your description "currently on DAX 12 points grid step/6 p. TP...but I have to input in Piggy settings 1200/600" Because I have used the default roundnumber of 200, so your description is not clear to me...

Thanks again and nice weekend all...

--- 帖子 #752 ---
setting "200" in last Piggy line on DAX means that you are using a grid step of just 2 full Dax  points...definitely too little IMHO, btw today a good day with more than 400 DAX  points...however tricky again, I think it is easier (on nerves ) to trading currencies at the beginning

Happy trading and nice weekend...

I had my comp crunch some numbers on optimization from 2010 - now.

Hope you find them useful. See attached excel.

Looking at the graphs, and my risk appetite, can a max-drawdown % setting be added?

It would simply close all when max drawdown was reached. This would give maybe less results in the end, but sleeping at night must not be undervalued either.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Just an idea. End all trades, if the same color for all TF. (Or just selected). Alert indicator would help. Apology for Google Translate.

I quickly smashed something together.

This should give you the general idea of drawdown.

Function returns true when max drawdown is teached.

The variable maxDDpercent should be set in the beginning as external variable so you can use it in optimisation.

bool Drawdown()

{

bool drawdown = false;

double  balance = AccountBalance();

double  PnL =0;

int DDperc = 0;

bool select=false;

for(int i = OrdersTotal()-1; i >= 0; i--)

{ select=OrderSelect(i, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_TRADES);

PnL = PnL + OrderProfit();

};

DDperc = 100- ((balance+PnL)/balance*100);

//Print (balance + " ## "+ PnL + " ## "+ DDperc);

if (DDperc>maxDDpercent){drawdown=true;};

return(drawdown);

}

Thx, Franz

My problem has always been the same, entering code in fxdreema. It can be done and people do it very successfully but as for me, I struggle BIG TIME!

--- 帖子 #771 ---
I'm not sure about spread, I could look into this but the buys and sells already have a max slippage of 4 pips. They are just not there in the options.

Here is a version where you can adjust the slippage yourself if you wish to do so.

Thanks,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #772 ---
thank you, max. overnight spread on GJ was 16.7, do you have any clue whether/how such a high spread might influence Piggy's performance?

Thanks, Franz

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Depends how you trade it. For me if I was trading it as a 24/5 EA, I wouldn't care as I would accept this as an occasional happening that grids are going to be triggered outside main trading times and for something I am not needing to pay attention to, it will do what it does. For some, it will be an issue for them. If this would bother me, the first thing I would do is find another broker because even overnight, this is a large spread. I get about 10 pips on this pair during quiet periods of non-volatility.

It really all depends when the grid steps get triggered and will always be a game of hit and miss. Some times you will have grid steps triggered at night and for me I just accept it the way it is. Who is your broker by curiosity?

Daniel

--- 帖子 #774 ---
OK...it makes sense what you have said especially when using 200 pips grid step...my broker is JFD brokers!

Hi Everyone

What's everyones testing notes, what settings dont work, what settings do?

I've spent most of the weekend S.T the G/Y Pair, I was doing well on 100, 100, grid 200

200, 200, 250 and 200, 200 and 200 and 250, 250 and 250 worked well, with increased lot sizes for the step ups from 0.01 to 0.05

I've noticed a lot of other good settings, but 2009 later years just mess it up

Best Regards

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Yeah, global recession messed it up for everyone and took no prisoners.

A trader I know made a very interesting comment to me about backesting. He more or less said backtesting is ok but in a live situation you would have adapted to the conditions that are taking place. Meaning, if the EA was performing badly for a consecutive time, you would not have just leave it to continually running. You would have stopped it and not leave it in heavy DD.

One another note, I found that for backtesting now, I test 2000-2009 and then 2009 to Present on separate testing somethimes, depending what kind of EA I am testing.

I should check these higher grid steps as I have not explored them much beyond 200 pips due to poor profitability but increasing lot size I should have been smart about this. Lower DD does give you the room to trade more lots.

Import this into the fxdreema local version, not the online version.

I have added a close all based on the equity value before opening a trade. eg equity x 0.90 =      this is adjustable.

Round number block will also look different as he doesn't add new blocks now to the local version, I just find the layout better, but this will not import into the online version.

For everyone else, warning, do not use, it has not been tested live.

Running paper-trade mode with practice account.

I set trade-time start: 18:00 end: 08:00 on GBP USD

Yesterday trade was opened, and closed during today with profit (around 16:00)

Today, at 18:00 AND at 18:01 new trades were opened.

Both with initial lotsize.

I have a question:

Since I set Round Number at 100, I did not expect 2 trades to be opened close to eachother ?

Other question:

I see in the log file that the sell-orders were not opened with error "hedge is not permitted"

Since I am EU based, I thought I was allowed to hedge? I opened a demo account with fxcm uk.

I can ask them directly, but I would like to hear your experiences first.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
It's not necessarily where you are from but the broker themselves to whether you are going to be able to hedge with them or not. I don't know fxcm very well not their uk company but it could be that even their uk side doesn't allow hedge? I don't know.

As for your first question, I'm not sure what has happened here. I would need to know which version you are using as well as a screenshot example. Also was this on the fxcm account?

Sorry I can't be more helpful on this occasion.

Daniel and all.

just wanted to share with You one indi which i found 2 days ago. This is used for Renko charts, but this is working also at online charts as well with TF 5M or higher.

Please use and test it if You want, as i saw today two good arrows to trade with it.

Signal arrows [ pur[le and blue ]  stays after candle is closed, this is what i saw.

Still playing with the settings on GJ for intraday run, so far so good. Although it's quite aggressive, I run mine from 8AM till about 7PM (CET). V4-2, grid set to 25, TPs are at 100.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Is it possible to share source code?

--- 帖子 #812 ---
I do not have it. Pls check in google, there should be a source code on other forum.

It was indeed an issue with the broker, where the demo account was setup as a US-account. (probably because I registered via their US website)

Account has been setup again with hedging allowed and piggy is switched on again.

Let the (paper) trading commence !

I am trading GBP/USD on 18:00 - 08:00. I'll try to regularly post updates.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hi Daniel and everyone else,

Are you using the piggy EA live?

I have been using the EA on demo for almost 2 weeks, trading GBP/USD and AUD/CAD with a 3K£ account.

Grid distance 10 pips, buy/sell TP in pips 50.

It has made over £400 in 9 trading days.

I have to admit it would be scary on a live account.

I would feel comfortable trading this live with a 10k account if I had that much.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Hi normtold,

I don't want to make you unsure, but I would very, very hesitate to go live with such a TP/Grid ratio of 5 to 1. You have made 13% in 9 days, not bad, that would result to over 300% a year in longterm...realistic? I would say...not at all!

Daniel has given us very good settings with TP/Grid ratio of about 1:2 which might possibly work in the mid/long run, if gridstep is not too low. Moreover one should adjust the EA settings to the volatility of the respective currency pairs.

I'm planning to go live on a basket of 4 pairs and DAX30 on a 15k account (have running 24/6 with Sunday) after June 23th (Brexit event) and would be happy to achieve 3% per month respectively about 30-35% per year.

Happy trading and nice weekend, jdva

Dear KeyDuck, I just spot on, Missis Piggy (by now she is no longer a Miss) to be a range-based EA. Is this correct?

I run it in a demo and very much like what I see. However, it looks to me, the EA experience some troubles while the pair is trending. The more it trends, the bigger the DD gets. Please confirm whether I am right or wrong about the trend problem. I have BT and I am done with this, so maybe you know better?

Great EA Missis Piggy is otherwise! I think the retail traders need more range based EAs rather than trend based ones... Range is so predictable and easy to trade...

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Hi jdva,

Thanks for the comments about the TP/Grid ratio. I will adjust and test from next week.

All the best.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Interesting you ask this question as I was just having a discussion with one of my forex skype friends about it.

I am not trading the EA live at the moment because I am looking at profitability versus money that is tied up. At the moment I would personally only trade 0.01 lot for every £3500 in a trade account in a 200 pip grid environment and for me this is not good enough so I am looking at either improving this EA or am also in other projects.

I am not saying this EA cannot be profitable with less money but looking at 16 years backtest, there is always the odd year that produces big DD which I am not willing to take the same risk as others. I have lost too much money in the market that I am doing things the right way for once.

I don't want to scare anybody off but at least I am being truthful with sharing my thoughts rather than to lead people down the rabbit hole.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #819 ---
I think these are very fair comments. Also just to add, any EA that doesn't take any losses and just closes profits will be risky in the DD department. In real terms, how much money is one willing to tie up in losses? Personally, I can afford about £600 tied up but anything beyond £1000 would be scary in a live environment.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
It's not as much a question about ranging and trending. The problem with the EAs performance is in a scenario that I like to call a "Trend No Return". As for most grid EAs it is always a case of PA not returning to price. Trend is no problem so long as retrace is significant enough afterwards but as said, about once a year, there is cases where there is trend and very little retrace which is where the risk lies.

You are wight in what you are saying for the most part.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Hi Daniel,

did you ever try USD/CNH as that is Controlled by the CentralBank ... I would say in a Grid (your round number) of 125. My backtest gave Data only from last year November, and run from 1200 to 1700 with an DD of 10 percent, maxDD 25% and 115 sell/buy Positions, which is at the limit I would say.

Maybe you have better backtest data ... I will try it next week with an other Broker.

Other questions ... do you think that your Piggy EA will run with other open Orders with different MagicNo?

Do Piggy run well in case of an Restart of the EA (for example, lost of InternetConnection).

Thanks for your answer and your good work

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Hello,

Nice indicator.

Try to put togheter the Swing_ZZ.

Set the Swing_ZZ to 4 bars.

IF you have the zigzag at the same time of the arrow, it is a good point to entry.

Exit when the next zigzag appear..

--- 帖子 #823 ---
I would like to ask this question too. I only trade London time and early NY time. (4am  to 10 am NY time) If I close my pc and open it again in the next day, will it manage the open trades?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
I have the same question, the piggy can handle the open trades if we turn off the PC and turn on again?

--- 帖子 #825 ---
That's what I was referring to on my previous post #732. It does work indeed.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Very good, maybe someone can recode the EA to fix this, until this is better close the open positions each friday to avoid the weekends gaps and the open trades.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Yeah, I don't have a great deal of data for the USD/CNH from any of my broker platforms so for this reason I will not be exploring it much. I would like to see at least 5 years worth of data to consider anything and better if I can get 2000-Present.

As for internet connection loss, the EA should trigger back again on reconnection. I don't see issues with this. As far as the magic numbers, so long as you are using magic numbers that are different to each other, there should be no interference with orders to each other.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
from my testings -> yes will manage old open positions.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
I would love to explore any indicators that people share with me but if it is not an mq4 file format, it will be useless for me unless I wanted to use it in manual trading. If you have an mq4 file, I am happy to explore and have a play with it.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #830 ---
thank You very much.

will test it next week

All, enjoy the weekend !

PS. yesterday i closed Piggy earlier with 0,7% net profit. I had to went out and did not want to leave Piggy till closing the market.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
ANY EA will not manage trades while the PC is off or the internet connection is not present. Also, the MT4 needs to be turned on with the EA in a chart.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
We all agree with that, the EA won't manage any trades while the PC/MT4 is off that's understood. However, if you turn the PC off at 10pm and on again at 10am the next day, the EA is still able to manage the trades from the previous session. I think that's not bad at all if you know what you are doing.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Yes, the EA can pick up where it left off but I'm not sure why one would attempt to trade like this. Having said that, if your grid size is 200 pips or so, it is less likely that it would make such a big move overnight. I don't recommend this at all but IF you are going to do this, bare in mind of the nightly news announcements just as BoJ news that normally happens around midnight GMT.

Hi everyone,

How is everyone's testing going? Mines not working out.

What pairs & settings are working well for you all?

I've gone through a number of pairs and settings. I'm not getting good results from 2009 to 2012, 1013 - current, 2009 - current. And I'm pretty convinced we'll be all bashing our heads against the wall to find that sweetspot.

I also performed a strategy tester that took over 10 days to run with PC on 24/7, in the hopes I could share the tests. The only results that look good are if the TP is different for both longs and shorts. In order to get the numbers looking good, the TP settings need to both be of the same numbers so it renders a lot of the testing a waste of time. The only good note to come of the testing, you'll need at least $10,000 for 0.01 lots with returns up to 8% a year. Round Numbers of anything under 200 are not viable as too many trades will open. But If you're happy with approx 8% a year, stick with 200 round numbers, with 200 - 300 TP's at 0.01 lots.

What results have you guys got that worked?

Suggestions improve?

1. to incorporate a stop loss in trades that are just getting too big to handle

OR

2. I think it would be good to use Method 2... a complete rewrite of this one and model one after model 2 (link from first post here going to a YT video). That's what initially drew me into this thread after watching that youtube video. I think it would be interesting to see a working model of that?

You see, it makes sense in what the 2nd method did. I know this EA does something similar and was wondering why that route wasn't chosen, or if you've even attempting to give it a try?

Best Regards

--- 帖子 #836 ---
I don't know what to say to these comments other than to say there are events that happen in years that hardly any EA will survive. The trading period of global recession and the year before and after are tough for any EA and I would even guess manual trading. You are nearly right but not quite. I would not go as far to say that you need $10,000 per 0.01 lot but I would say you need somewhere in the region of $5-6k.

However, if you think you are going to find something better in Remon's method and have someone program the method, this has already been done. Not only did Remon program his own EA and has been unsuccessful but also another programer built a version called APG 4.0 that nearly flawlessly did part 1 and 2 of method 1 and both these will yield similar results than Piggy n The Middle. In fact, it is not to boast but only stating a fact, Piggy n The Middle performs slightly better in backtesting that Remon's versions of EAs because I decided to eliminate all toxic trades as quick as possible rather than to only look at bottom losers and hope for positive retraces later.

At the end of the day, market conditions change and forex is always a risk. I have not yet found an EA I would put live money on, not even my own. But having said this, my risk appetite is much smaller than most I think because when I was trading manually and a full time trader as my only means of income, I almost lost my house and will never jeopardize and get into this kind of position again. And having said this, I think I am getting closer to developing and EA that I would put real money with, it is easier to judge these things when you do the work yourself then you know exactly what you are dealing with.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #837 ---
of course, that is correct, Daniel,... but the question was, whether Piggy EA does manage old positions further when PC was turned off and turned on again. This it does definitely!

But unfortunately, in my case the Tradeinfo indi lost all data from past week  over the weekend. Is that normal or is there a speciel setting to maintain them?

Any help appreciated!

Happy trading, jdva

FYI, Piggy hit the target on DAX today 1,09 % net profit and was just turned off.

Hi

Anyone have EA that making loss only in EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF, AUDUSD or all pair. EA will make constant loss mean if i will open 5000$ then it will blow in 1 day or fast mean only loss in trade.

i have strategy if work then share here for all.

Thankx in advance

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Wish I could help you but I don't know much of that indi. If you setup a trade explorer and set a custom date to the days you have ran the EA, this might help?

Daniel

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Heh! I have a strategy too for this kind of EA. Just reverse the BUY and SELL conditions.

It works good on a lot of losing EAs. I am currently working on one that seems pretty successful when the conditions got reversed.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #842 ---
hmm, normally this is not a very succesfull approach.

But hey... I am curious what you come up with.

Back to piggy... Running forward testing mode on one box, whilst the other is trying to optimize for the best gbp/usd settings.

So far, after 4 days of optimizing, I found one .set that has 60% yearly profit, and less DD than the initial deposit. Backtesting over a 6-year period.

Only 1600 hours of testing to go  Lets see how far we can get.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
This wonderful EA still working, almost 30% in only two weeks, I hope to finish this month with 50%.

greetings

--- 帖子 #844 ---
what settings did you use? Every test I'm doing so far seems to just blow the account out, no matter if its a 10k, 20k, 30k during really rough market areas.

Best regards

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Hi Daniel,

I would because I've done the testing. I spent the last 10 days 24 hrs a day running almost every test you can think of. And the results are the same.

The ones that passed the strategy tester have odd TP levels while others even, and you cant use those odd levels; TP levels need to be of the same amount, as that of the buy and sell lot sizes.

Round numbers. Cant use a low one like 10 to 25 because too many trades are opened.

I'm not saying one was better than the other. I was talking from logical point of view, looks good in theory and was wondering if anyone had tried it? That's all

See, I've tried settings of (first two numbers are the buy and sell TP's, last number is the round number

1-1-50

1-1-40

3-3-50

3-3-40

10-10-50

10-10-40

100-100-100

200-200-200

300-300-300

And various even numbers in between. and I'm coming up stuck over and over again.

What settings have been working well for others? No one wants to give up the info - they just post images.

Best regards,

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I think I posted an excel sheet with optimisation results.....

Anyway, be carefull with huge profit settings. My backtest showed so far (over 6 years) that it will also mean a risk of huge drawdown.

You can deal with this in a few ways:

be Lucky to enter in a "good period"

Take out profit regularly and "surf" on the winnings

Find settings that give less profit, but also less DD than the initial deposit.

I am aiming for the last option. When I get my ROI, I am prepared to take more risk

--- 帖子 #847 ---
I have tested rigorously the EA and that is why I have left GBPYJPY 200 round numbers and 100 TP to be the recommended settings as they are the best long term settings I could find. You don't need $10,000 with these settings however as said, I think you need about $5-6k. I am not 100% about the numbers as I tun my account and test in £GBP but certainly not $10k needed.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
As you can see from the graph, the approach can be very successful. You just need to know which EAs you can actually reverse conditions with.

The problem for me is not as much the reverse conditions, they worked out great. The greater problem is that it seems to backtest about 9 years brilliantly and flawlessly thinking I could have found a grail EA of some sort but to my disappointment when you check around 2008-Present it is very much plat P/L with a dip in losses.

I guess the Elite Big Brother Forex have decided to change the way the market moves around those years to present.

"Oh well, back to the drawing board!"

Daniel

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Hello FXCyborg,

sure here you go.

Put the set in GBPJPY and USDJPY chart, then leave the Piggy 24hours working. Is in .txt, delete this and have the .Set.

use piggy n the middle v4

nice day

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Hey Daniel

Amazing graph, can you share this new parameters?

thank you

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Currently forward testing the GBP/USD.

Today was not such a good day, still waiting for retracement.

Luckily I am forward testing to get familiar with the DD, otherwise i would start to feel uncomfortable.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
They are not from Piggy. It is a new EA I have made I am developing. The problem I am having is that after from 2000-2008, all great and up hill. From 2008 to present, very flat and slightly down turning in areas. I am still testing but I have found improvement in the slope when I get it to trade only between 19h00 - 7h00 GMT but I am still not satisfied with what I am seeing. If I can get the EA running to some satisfaction, I will share it with people but I don't want to start another wasted thread like Zig and Zag EA I started. There was no participation in it, and was a bit premature to share as I hadn't finished the EA to satisfaction.

This one here I am waiting... it could be a no starter if I can't solve something for the trade period of 2008-Present. So far so good but I am not going to be all excited about this yet. There is more work to do.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #853 ---
bad news, seems grid was too tight and DAX went up with shorts open. I had to close them manually not to hit margin call.

Well, going back to testing then.

Regards

mojepole

--- 帖子 #854 ---
I think the DAX30 is not well suited to Piggy EA trading...because of its volatility, meaning strong trending periods without  relevant retracements, especially in down mode it may easily going down 500 points per day and that's not even a crash scenario! Moreover overnight spread, at least at my broker, is pretty high.

Yesterday's range was 358 points going up constantly. To survive such a strong move, I guess one need a grid step of min. 50-100 points.

Happy trading, jdva

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Without knowing the strategy, maybe try the stop-loss settings? Risk more, more DD, but if the overall strategy is still sound then it should hold.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
DAX is applicable. Just need to find something to signal the big trends. For example, DOT multimeter. Close all before something worse happens.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
apparently, you have found the Holy Grail...

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Try Grail with another filter. Two are better than one.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
I've optimized it, the best I can get is about 6% a year I think I used 200TP-200TP-300RN, which is good for an EA. I've seen others post results of around 1.4% - 30% a day/week. I was wondering what the settings were.

There is no way this EA can work on a balance less than 10K for the long haul. Thinking out loud there is no reason to use any EA if it's going to do well for some months and not some others where it blows the account. IF we can avoid these the only settings that will work for the long haul to overcome 1000-1500 moves with hardly any retraces, are those with less risk applied, like above for 6% a year.

Here's how I see it, we're never going to avoid those rough years in the future, not at settings that yield 1% or so a day.

A non-ranging market is the cause of this EA from reaching its fullest potential.

We need to control these floating losses more.

Maybe we can have it built in, or a script which can be loaded onto the chart with the EA attached, and allocate a certain percentage, or fixed amount of profits to close off the existing floating losses; I've been closing off trades once it reached the max 300 trades to free up some more trades that can be hedged. Which had me thinking...

I think there should be an "EVEN" amount of longs and shorts to be made. So equity can stay more or less even. This way if the trend continues, there wont be more of one or the other going in the opposite direction putting the account at more risk because there's no equilibrium. Once we figure out how to create it once a group of longs or shorts were closed out, is to next focus on stabilizing the equity, by either closing off some negatives from the "overall" profit created and/or, cease to add more trades at same round number levels if the trade has not been closed off before hand.

Because from what I'm seeing, is the table is becoming one side heavy, e.g: there are more longs than there are shorts live, more so due to a group of short trades were closed off previously, but at some point in time, especially in a non-ranging market with just momentum to keep going up or down with very little or no retracement the table is going to get lop-sided and tip over.

If we can avoid overlap of new trades being opened where another one was that's still open, create equilibrium in the equity after a group of trades have been closed off, to have equal number of longs and shorts of the total max trades currently given (300 regardless of what type they are).

Then we can see how we can optimize the equity, and add otherwise riskier settings.

Best regards,

--- 帖子 #860 ---
trading a grid means you sometimes trade against the trend and build up drawdown.

My optimizer is still running... about 600 hours to go.

Starting with a small account really limits the options I think. If you can handle more DD, the ROI gets better. But... you can still get a margin call and should be willing to loose it all.

so far I found best settings on the cable, with a 10k starting account to have a DD of 8k.

Unsure if that means a margin call though, and since my testing is not finished yet, i cant plot it into a graph yet.

My forward testing is running into DD, but still slowly building profits. We maybe get retracements on the cable soon as it is touching the upper resistance. Then I expect some magic....  Will keep you informed.

i need to find this scalper if anybody can help

--- 帖子 #863 ---
This is my sharing for the moment with Piggy n the Middle ....

Firstly, I would like to thank keydcuk for coding this EA for all of us. Fantastic

I started to forward test v4 on April 20 to May 3 running only EURGBP and updated to v4-2 on April 22.

The settings I use are....

Lot 0.01on $1K

TP is 15 pips (Buy/Sell)

Server time 00 for start and 24 for end

Round number is 10

Made 14% for that period with DD of 48%. I pondered.... this is too high a DD.

I observed that EURGBP range/swing is too tight and Piggy kept on opening too many orders at the same round numbers .

Then on May 3 I switched to AUDUSD which has a wider range/swing using the same settings.

The profits grew to 45% as at this moment and DD so far always below 10%.

My thinking is that this EA won't work on big range/swing pairs if you're like me using tight TP & round numbers.

I will continue this test and update here.

Thank you again to keydcuk !

You are trading only the GBPJPY pair , right?

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Thanks. But it is really Daniel who should get the blame . Without him, this all would not have been possible.All I am doing is pushing some buttons.

Anyway, glad to help.

Today's retracement on the GBP/USD triggered a close of the sell-positions that build up the last week .

A nice 2% increase, although the drawdown was relatively heavy; about 5%. (based on a 10k USD account)

Also notable figure: the brokerage fees  would sum up to be around 10% of the profits, using fxcm UK micro account.

All in all I am happy with the results so far. Seeing the drawdown did make me sweat a bit... even if it is only paper trading yet.

Optimizer still running. Hope it will finish this weekend so my pc is free to play some games again

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Since we're passing blame here..... .... I'm blaming Remon for his ideas that inspired me to build this EA even though it doesn't replicate his method

--- 帖子 #882 ---
It's sad how he was ridiculed honestly. Do you know if he still intends to updating his thread?

--- 帖子 #883 ---
I personally unsubscribed to both of his threads because I think there was too much drama. Last thing I heard from another FF friend was that he hasn't posted for about 2 weeks but I didn't check to whether this was a fact or not.

He got a lot of stick for no better reason than being confident in what he was doing. Whether he is or was going to be successful or not is not the point. The mockery was very uncalled for. If people didn't want to listen to what he had to say, they should have left rather than to be rude and comment at all!

--- 帖子 #884 ---
tundex, you leave the EA 24hrs? or you still trading in london session?

--- 帖子 #885 ---
I left it 24hrs since the setting is 0.5 for RN but sometimes I shut off MT4 for some hours.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
How do you determine what hours to shut off MT4? same hours every day?

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
peggy in the middle .... ?

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Sad how he was ridiculed?

Are you seriously this daft?

Have a look at his first post HERE.

He calls this "His Trading System", after a complete and all out failure of his previous No Loss System.

10% per day, or no Loss...Geez, if he already had an idea how to make 10% per day, why not just keep doing that?  Really, who gives a shit if a system takes a loss if it still generates 10% per day????

Now really...Look at the actual trade executions instead of just the overall stats.

1.  Open Time

2.  Size

3.  Close Time.

And look at the groups of trades as I have separated them.

Do you notice anything?

Maybe how the trades were all same lot sizes per block, all multiple pairs all taken within 2 seconds and closed within 2 seconds of each other.

Do you think this is what this guy was manually doing?

or

Do you think this might have already been an automated system????

This system he talks about, already exists, is already automated and has absolutely zero resemblance to anything he has talked about by way of an actual trade logic.

This doesn't even touch the other posts with stats that he had that don't even exist anymore.  His primary stats on this were over a year old.

He's not coming back...he'd be lynched...probably by the guy who wrote the software, if not just the common folk who are tired of having the wool pulled over their eyes.

Look at the actual trade executions instead of just the overall stats.

Thanks for the stat..... what a snob !! I hope some moderator has taken action against him.

Woah there cowboy, relax.

People who can actually communicate came in and pointed that out, in, you know, normal words instead of trolling him out of his own thread. Sure the name wasn't perfect but thank Odin we have ways to make it clear without insulting people left and right.

What I mean is that FF sometimes becomes worse than a mob in the dark ages.

Have a nice weekend!

Nobody is attacking this thread's op...because he isn't making outlandish claims.

If people don't want to have their opinions commented on, posting them in a public forum is a really bad idea.

The load that Reamon was trying to pass was transparent from the hop...some of us got it, some took a while...some are still buried up to their eyebrows in bullshit.

Just because I point it out shouldn't make me a bad guy...

Others that didn't have it figured out prior to my post, will now hopefully qualify the information that is put in front of them.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Oh no I wasn't talking about this thread's op, I was talking about Raemon.

I also didn't accuse anyone, especially you. I was generalizing really. What I wanted to say is bullshit or no bullshit the shit that he (Raemon) got could've been avoided.

There were people who came in, voiced their concerns / opinions and left. And then there were the ones who stayed and just trolled.

Apologies if you took offence, I didn't mean it that way.

Now focus back to piggy.

My first week of forward testing in a screenshot.

I can tell you I was pretty impressed first day. Then the other days came and just compounded DrawDown.

I was worried, trend-horizontal-trend-horizontal... how much can an account take? Drawdown quickly accumulated.

Luckily it did not take that much retrace to close all the positions with a profit.

I think people who use this system live must have balls of steel. Or... as me... back test enough to gain confidence and trust to jump in with real money. (i'm not there yet.....)

Working in IT in a trading organization, I see how much effort it takes for the professional traders to build a trading system professionally.

There simply is no quick win. work...work....work

--- 帖子 #896 ---
I've received PMs asking for the settings.

Here it is....

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Hey guys, does anyone know where i can find an ea that will cut my position size just before my stop loss?

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Heh, this post made me chuckle. It seems it's exactly like that in some instances, nearly praying for the retrace as you become paranoid it might not happen!

--- 帖子 #899 ---
This might be a stupid question but...

Is there any wersion of piggy with the same opiton wich is in other reamon ea's, i mean to choose that it would only buy or only sell?

I would like to try piggy's logic in the same way im trying other ea's for foward testing

And if there is none could somebody implement that?

thx

--- 帖子 #900 ---
hello, keydcuk  I would like to do an EA that when I give him away after 15 pips if the market goes up and opens a buy order 15 pips after it opens and after another 15 pips it opens another, when it reaches the profit of 10 EUR closes everything and the same thing for the store no buy stop or sell stop or buy limit or sell limit

you can do it?

--- 帖子 #901 ---
There is a setting in the ea properties for this when you start the testing.

My optimizer on gbp usd for 2010 - 2016 has finally finished.

In the attachment the results.

Finally I get to play some games again on my box

Maybe I'll run optimizer on JPYUSD as well, but first time to play.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
There is a version that does only buy and only sell. It is version 4-1a.

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...60#post8875160

Please ignore the settings of inputs to set at TRUE, TRUE. It will not work, but yes. You can set the EA to do the buy only up and sell only down in grid steps.

Note that it does not replicate Remon's methods of his system. The close conditions are still the same as every other version which closes all toxic trades at the earliest opportunity and at the settings of your TP.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

--- 帖子 #904 ---
For this, you only need to use v4-1a and set round numbers to 15 pips. v4-1a is an older version that round numbers are calculated by price fraction rather than just tell it to trade 15 pips. You will need to read up on how this works but 15 pips in price fraction for the JPY pairs will be 0.15 and mostly anything else will be 0.0015.

As for the TP, I have no EA version that takes profit at a monetary value but you can always use a pip calculator to figure out what this is. 6.8 GBP is approximately 10 pips and 10 USD is approximately 10 pips when trading 0.1 lot. I have not calculated a EUR value as I don't use EUR anymore. There are pip calculators on the net you can look at that will help you.

Daniel

Hi,

thanks for the result. possible to add in the header of each column, easy for reading.

what's the quality of the backtest?

--- 帖子 #907 ---
hi tundex,

based on your observation, what's the maximum DD based on setting 0.5 round number and 100 TP for the past 20 days?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Unsure what you aim for with your question. I cannot answer anything else than "excellent, of course"

The file it what it is... the result of an optimizer run.

I do not recommended settings. Interpret and use the data at your own discretion.

You could for example use the results as a collection of set-files, so that you can pick the settings you want to further test and personalize.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
sorry for confusion. what i means the data quality >90%?

Possible to guide how to have this data for back testing purpose? thanks

--- 帖子 #910 ---
If you open metatrader, you can download data for backtesting from your broker directly.

This data is used in the optimizer.

I have no means to verify the dataquality that I received.

If you want to see if the results are comparable to your environment, why not simply pick a set that you like, and run a backtest for this set yourself?

Since you are member since sept 2014, so I assume you know how to run a backtest in mt4 ?

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Yes, I did.

But the data quality not really satisfied. Understand there is data quality >90%, i have tried to download, but the free version only works for terminal 650 and below. So trying to get more quality data for backtesting.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Please let me know if you find better data. I'm interested.

Since this is not a scalping system, I am unsure if it makes a big difference.

But... this why I am currently forward testing...... to check if the backtest results are holding in live situation.

So far today I was able to capture some pips. Will post my weekly results on Friday again.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Halloo everyone! First of all apologize me for my bad english, im from ita :-)

Second, thanks to Keyduck for piggy, a very good expert advisor.

Anyway, after 2 weeks of demo, I think we can avoid bad trade opening by setting a simple RSI filter to allow piggy to place orders.

In other words we know piggy works at his best during lateral market conditions, up and down and again. The whorst situation is when markets switches in high trend (no matter up or down).

So, a simple RSI filter before piggy trade logic and maybe we can avoid to have bad trades opened. I think best settings can be to allow piggy trading between 45 an 55 RSI limits.

The filter can be switchable also to varios timeframes period of RSI itself.

What do you think about this idea? Someone can code this in Piggy?

Best wishes at all.

Mat

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Could be worth a shot.  Piggy is a ranging, RSI filter is a trending. They could complement eachother, but also could nullify eachother; piggy also keeps opening orders to trigger the retracement. Danger is that the RSI will also block this retracement mechanism.

Should be tested thoroughly, I am happy to help with that.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
seems interesting strategy! however, in my case, this EA is not working and never opened a trade until now. Other EA can work but this cant. does anyone know how to solve this problem?

--- 帖子 #916 ---
can you be a bit more descriptive?

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Could you share your setting & and your optimization for this ea?

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Is the attachment not clear?

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Ok egosuma, i think you can try to code rsi filter with settings to allow trade between rsi range and period :-) Let we know

Happy pigging :-)

Mat

--- 帖子 #920 ---
I can help testing... I cannot programm

--- 帖子 #921 ---
I think you need to actually read the thread and understand how the EA works. Possibly even post #1 will tell you.

You are likely not having open trades because it trades on round numbers. It is simply waiting for a price to hit.

Whatever happened to this Edorenta? Have you given up on this project?

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Sorry for replying late. The maximum DD I noticed was around 50% current DD.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
So far today has also been pretty succesfull. Lots of volatility.

I do notice however, that a limited DD does not safe-guard from a margin call.

Depending on how the broker implements margin-requirements.

On the demo account, my broker gives margin requirements based on the lots.

Since there are both buy and sell positions open, the DD can be limited, but the margin-requirements can still shoot up.

Unsure how I could backtest for margin requirements. Anyone have an idea?

This would help determining the deposit you would need.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Can the setting start trading from 100 usd?

Because it's really working great in my demo and wanna trade in mini live account from now on

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hello Airu,

Yes, I think using 100usd in micro account is equal to have $10,000usd in standar account so you can try. My demo account start 9 of May and it have 38% of profit along this month and many news that have big drawdowns but like shiva say, only need to be patient and resist this DD.

I will star too a mini account with 100usd soon.

Regards

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Thanks for your reply. yup just bet 100usd and see how it goes haha hopefully it will work continuously

--- 帖子 #928 ---
I am using micro account in forward testing.

With "save" settings, where in a 6-year backtest the DD was never higher than 80% of the initial deposit, I do get today already 10% of my margin requirements.

Market is trending (today it is ranging a bit) with no retracement yet. So be carefull to not exceed your margin requirements.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
I don't want to lead anybody the wrong way with my comments but I have ran a backtest from 2000-Present with this EA and for a setting of GBPJPY with 150pips round numbers and a TP of 75 pips, The max DD figure runs at about £6600. Take it for what you will. One needs to also look that this was exceptional circumstances during a period of global recession in and around October 2009 I think?? was the worse period of the backtest. Then things got back to normal. If you ignore this period as it was an exceptional circumstance, the EA didn't do too bad but has reached a DD of about £2200 to the best of recollections. I wish I would have saved the backtest.

Personally, I think it is too much DD for the risk appetite that I am willing to take. I know that DD on average is a lot less than these large and max figures I mention and for the most part it does very well. At the moment, I have better interest in developing something that has less DD and some steady profit regardless the amount although preferably the larger the better. For all of those who are using it live, I wish you all the best! At least I can rest by having you let know my thoughts a few times about what I think and to say I am not trading this one live. If you reach a million, I will accept a 1% thank you gift!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #930 ---
please note:  DrawDown is not the same as margin requirements.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
This weeks results were somewhat similar to last week. Profitable, buildup position and wait for retrace.

Testing really helps ease the nerves, Already feeling more confident in loosing position.

But still I am not very comfortable with the margin requirements. Maybe I am using the wrong pair, GBP/USD has steep margin requirements.

My optimizer for JPY is still running. Will still take a while to complete. So far it has not produced any results that I would be happy with, but its only at about 10% of the total.

here is the screenie of this week:

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Some brokers charge extra margin on hedged positions and others don't.

I have been told that Global Prime don''t but I have not had a live account with them yet to confirm whether this is true or not.

You might want to look into different brokers to whether they charge the extra margin on hedged positions or not. In essence, they should not as a hedged position is one that doesn't have any extra DD as it goes up or down as it is hedged.

Hi Goldcourse,

interesting results; can you share the .set file?

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Bigape,

Sure, here ....

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Hi Goldcourse,

many thanks.

They are more or less the same parameters that I'm using on the various cross (with its adaptations).

For now, my results are not bad but often I have DD very high especially in terms of the floating point.

Are now several months that I'm working with the source code that has kindly provided Keydcuk (thanks) but, objectively, are not able to find an intelligent solution to the problem described above.

I made a decision and I built an EA that implements all the functionality of a TradeManager evolved that manages and controls the Piggy, also contemplating the stop of the system when there are situations of Target Total Profit or Stop Loss Total (also trailing stop) . Overall the situation has improved.

Now I'm using my Tablet: later (when at home) I will post on the forum various screenshots.

I think we still have to work a lot on the Piggy: I believe its potential is huge, I hope (thanks again to Keyduck and all for the work done up to now).

We share different ideas to manage the concerned DD (floating point high).

No wonder already written codes, but ideas: then we will implement in MQL.

Assuming it is possible to solve the problem, I do not know yet.

For example: we could support a strategy being strong trend "cover" the Piggy.

Thank you all.

Regards

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Great

I'm all for finding a way out of high DD.

Looking forward to your recommendations.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
I think we have a few options to minimize opening positions in the wrong direction (and thus minimize the DD)

- can we look at the longterm MA and only open accordingly (for example: buy if price below moving average)

- We can maybe use a "accellorator" indicator to avoid opening positions during sudden spikes

- combine with a divergence indicator

When the markt goes against the position, the grid-strategy from piggy would optimize the results.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Hi Egosuma,

They could be of major deployments to think and start doing some tests.

I'll try to include them within the code to understand how to use them best.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Thanks for sharing this brother! I'm curious to see a snippet of the code. I'm a programmer myself and I had no idea about the software you're talking about. I might install it now and give it a shot. I don't think it would be as flexible as myself though lol

--- 帖子 #941 ---
I think you would be very surprised with all the things you can do with it. Being a coder, I think it would speed up things as well as you can just add blocks visually rather than to program it. Something that may take you an hour may take you 5-10mins. Also, the software allows you to add code... so where there is not a function with the software on any of the programming blocks, you just add what you need.

If I was an expert coder, I think I would still use fxdreema. It is easy to use and as I said, you can add your own code to what isn't there...

The weekly screeny of forward testing.

Huge trend this week. Lots of DD. Good news; when strong trend with lots of DD, the margin requirements are relatively not as steep due to the single-sidedness of the positions. Still, a DD of 1250,- is something to consider.

On the plus side, the strategy has made a profit of 1200,- in 3 weeks.

My backtesting and settings were done optimizing on a 10k initial deposit, so this is well within target.

My max DD of 8k has also not been met, so far "all in the green"

Lets see how next week develops.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Update....

June 6 - June 10

The demo went into deep DD (86.37%) and margin down to as low as 200%.

There was not enough of retrace to counter the upward movement due to NFP and a weak USD .

With some manual intervention, the account grew 5.28% for this week.

Lesson learn ....

1). Avoid trading during NFP.

2). Account size shud at least be 3K for every 0.01 lot traded.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Backtest for 4 months since this February until now. max DD was 56.25% and actually it made me lose all on January in 2016. it is risky but most of big DD occurred  at Newyork time from opening for 5 hours. if anyone can add some script for not trading those hours, it will be much better for this strategy.

--- 帖子 #946 ---
There is already an option for trade days and trade hours but be aware that if you have any open trades when the hours or trade days are not active, it will still keep what you have open active.

There are many reasons why a backtest could fail.

You can't expect and EA to perform great for a start balance of 100 $, £, EUR or whichever currency it is.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Update.....

June 13 to June 17

Finally, the retrace happened on June 15 but too bad it closed with a -28% due to the setting of a too tight TP of 15 pips.

Overall the balance stands at +32.55% at close on Friday.... Still admirable !

I have changed the settings from June 15 onwards to... TP 30(Buy & Sell) , RoundNumbersPips to 20.

let's see coming week......

--- 帖子 #950 ---
No screeny this week.

Last week I decided to download historical data and run some backtests on a longer period. This succeeded.

Then I decided to run an optimizer on a 15 year period. After a few days, the results came in. I was flabbergasted.

The settings found gave a 90% profit monthly.

So I tested some more, and some more, and some more. Made cross sections, partial tests etc etc...

Could not sleep a night, it seemed to good to be true.

So the new settings to forward testing. The results were short of amazing.... No profit at all this week. Only 1 opened trade.

So I plotted the details of each opened trade from the backtest, and started my investigation.

Basically, the historical data that was imported was incorrect. This was only visible when plotting the visual testresults. (which I normally dont do for time reasons)

So I reverted back to my original settings.

I am curious what the brexit will do. Probably create a huge spike in the market. And how piggy will handle this in practice.

Then, if i am happy, I will probably open a real account with lower leverage, and start trading for real.

I am thinking that a lower leverage will decrease the margin requirements and the Drawdown.

--- 帖子 #951 ---
This EA is a grid system. So it opens trades on set intervals (buy and sell) and tries to get out of each position (the accumulated buys or the accumulated sells) at a profit.

This means you can and will expect a huge drawdown.

You need to find a sweet spot between

- initial deposit

- the settings of the ea

- the leverage of the trading account

- the risk appetite you are willing to take.

- when to run the ea.

You must do the following:

- test test and test the ea, until you get a feeling for it and it is suitable for you.

For each person and for each account "acceptable settings" will be different.

For example, gbp/usd was pretty much ranging last few months. I think the approaching brexit plays a key role in this.

The ea could ghave run with very agressive settings. (more agressive makes more profit, but will make more drawdown)

I expect the brexit event itself to cause a spike in the market, followed by a trend. Running this ea on the same agressive settings can easily cause high drawdown and blow up an account.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #952 ---
screeny of the system during brexit.

As expected, we see a nice display of red and blue lines.

The profit was good, and the margin requirements were lower than expected.

However, the strangest thing happened; the drawdown was a lot higher that the margin used !

at a certain point, the DD was 12k, and the margin requirements only 6k.

I asked my broker how this could be and await the response.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Update.....

June 20 to June 24

The volatility of the BREXIT event contributed to Piggy's good performance.

DD for the week was below 18% .

Profit for the week was +27%.

Accumulated profit is now +64.98%

--- 帖子 #954 ---
I guess your acc is demo? Because the spread and slippage have been huge several times as the referendum results came out, such as at 23:17 uk time, none of your trades would have been filled properly with most retail brokers I'm afraid your performance is qui theoretical

Its taking trades corectly but not managing them the way it should

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

these are my settings

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I have the same ea on a different account and its managing them corectly

What im trying to do is to combine piggy and hft ea on the sme pair. In theory i want piggy to make profits when there is a ranging market and hft to recover the loses of piggy when the price goes into a strong trend . Im trying two accounts in one hft is on a 1h chart an on the other on a 4h chart. The problem is that piggy is behaving totaly crazy on one account...

Any idea why??

And 50 pip grid is not that tight

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Hello keydcuk,

Thanks for your hard work, developing ideias and systems for all the FF community.

1. Is it possibly for you to change or add an option, so the take profit parameter can be in "money" and not in pips? As you know if we have different size lots in grid step up or down, sometimes the EA close positions with profit in pips, but not profit in "money".

2. Not so important, but is it possible to add a step lot increase option? (0,01;0,01;0,01; 0,02;0,02;0,02, 0,03;0,03;0,03)

Thanks again, good luck and keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Please make sure that if you run multiple ea's on the same pair, you use different magic numbers.

Other than that, I would not know.

June 27 to July 1

Max DD for the week did not exceed 10%.

Profit for the week was +13.67%

Accumulated profit is now +78.65%

--- 帖子 #963 ---
For me, the Ea works amazingly, but i have changed to manual trading when the 7th trade is opened and everything are suffering losses: I stop the robot, and open a martingale till the 10th trade. Most of times, that is perfect ...... But if the trend goes on.... we have to accept our losses !!!WITHOUT EXCEPTION !!!

Would it be possible to automatize this idea by any way?

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Profit in pips has been set for a specific reason which I have already mentioned in this thread when the question of changing the TP to money rather than pips.

The actual pips are not pips in terms of pip distance, it is already calculating the total profit in money and converting it to a pip value, so in essence it is already closing as a money value but equated as pips at the input chosen.

As for the step lot option, I have looked at this before and I personally would have liked to have added this option but have not been able to figure out how to implement it 100%.

Sorry this might not be what you want to hear for a reply.

Happy Pipping!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #965 ---
I think that the v4 version was a bit complex as you need to calculate grid size in terms of round numbers & price. 111.00-112.00 is 100 pips but in another pair like the EURUSD, 1.3500-1.3600 is 100 pips. This could be the reason you are struggling with.

If you use v4-2 this has been resolved by setting grid size in actual pips.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #966 ---
In some cases if there are too many positions open in trade, the EA does close at a minor loss. It is not the grid size but if there are too many positions open, you make minor losses because of the amount of spread loss I think.

Daniel

Another succesfull week.

I am satisfied with my testings and will go live next week on the gbp/usd.

Now to open a new broker account, dig up my old stash of gold coins, send it over to the broker and trust that I did the testing coorectly.

Very excited !

Hello keyduck,

Thanks for your answer, I was thinking about this, and maybe the problem is if we change of lot size after a cycle begins.  If we start with the same 0,1 lot size for all steps, and then change in the middle of the cycle for 0,30 step Up buy, for example, I think that the EA will not adapt the take profit to the new size lots. Maybe this might be the issue, with some orders closing in negative(money, not in pips).

Also, is there a way to make the EA to not close orders?, I mean, if there is something like, news or a big trend, my idea was to continue opening the orders in both directions, but we would be perfectly hedged till the event or the retracement started.

--- 帖子 #969 ---
What settings did you use on gbp/usd ?

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Regardless of lot size or positions open or where they sit on the chart, the EA calculates the value of money and converts it into pips. This is how the EA works.

If you can define what you mean by cycle and tell me at what point you want to increase lot sizes, then I can make something for you if this is what you wish. When mentioning how many trades open, if this is just buys, just sells or total buys & sells.

There is a way to not make positions close but again, you would need to define the conditions in which you want this to happen.

I am paying a lot less attention to this EA as I feel that his is more or less a finished product. In a way, I wish it wasn't because I had one thread follower who was going to do a coder's version of the EA and had presented what it was going to do with loads of filter options but this never got finished by him. It is not within my capabilities to do as much as what he had presented but I can make EA modifications to a certain extent. I just need well defined conditions to what the modification is and what it does and I will have a go at it, given the time.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
keydcuk, This is a great EA, and... when is the "Close All Trades at Equity %" feature be release.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Hello,

Thanks for your interest. I was never able to get this to work when I was programming it myself but there is a thread follower who has made a version that does close trades at equity percentage. His version was to use the equity % as a stop loss. The setting of 0.9 which is at default would basically look at DD and close all trades when 10% of equity was lost or moreso in the other sense where 90% of equity was left remaining.

I have tweaked this version differently from the original so that there is a flag of "once a day" set to "true". I have not forward tested it but I think this could be beneficial if what I am thinking works. As I have not programmed the main equity function, I do not know. The flag "once a day" will basically set the scene so that if the trades have closed due to equity, it will stop trading entirely until the next trade day and according to the hours and weekday filter, should you choose to use it.

If the setting of the flag is true and the Equity it at 0.9, it will stop trading that day taking a loss of 10%

I know some of you wanted to work with closing the EA when positive equity is reached. This is where I am not sure whether this will work or not but I am guessing that if you set the equity setting to 1.1 that it will close all trades at +10% and if flag set to true it will not trade until next day respecting the weekday and hours filter.

I don't know. I have been paying less attention to this EA lately but try it out and let me know if it works. If it doesn't, I can try to fix it so it can do what you would like it to do. I was not the one who originally programmed this version, just tweaked it a little. Hope it works out for you.

I have been back- and forward testing extensively with reasonably safe settings. Remember this is a grid system that relies on retracements to take profit.

Closing at equity% needs to be tested thorougly before applying it as a "saveguard"

Think of this ea to use your money and put it to work. The ea decides how much of your money it needs to put to work.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
thanks for sharing. it has positions which are open for too long period. is there any way to avoid it?

--- 帖子 #975 ---
There is not really a way to avoid it unless you stop the EA from running.

Essentially this EA is a virtual no loss EA, it doesn't accept closing positions unless it is in a profit. Saying this, if there are too many positions open, it does close at a loss. I am not saying it doesn't this is why I say "virtual", or I could have said "most of the times". Heavy DD is the weakness of the EA and even so, the heavier DD periods should only happen about once or twice a year if you are using the correct grid size, i.e. a very large one.

Through extensive backtest, 0.01 lot you would need about £4000 to run this safely and it is not to say there is no risk. Another global recession, another country going bankrupt, a nation's credit rating gone bad, a world war, anything could happen to make any pair go in one direction without seeing enough retracement to close the opposing trades that stay open.

It's as risky as any other EA but at least it is not a martingale.

Hi All.

I ran this EA on Aud/Usd pair on a demo a/c for 4 days and it gave me all profits ... I got excited and then ran it with real money its been a day and still giving profits. Presently stopped the EA before major announcements. Will give it a go next week again and keep you posted.

hello, can you tell which version you are using, on which pair and set file? thank you

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Make sure that before big events (like brexit) you close all open positions and stop the EA.

Such events with sudden big spikes can easily cause a margin call.

Be cautious ! And green pips for all !

Wow! Slippage is already at 4. I would personally get another broker if you are getting more than 4 pip splippage

--- 帖子 #983 ---
You can set the TP value to some unreachable number that the price will never hit. That way it will not close any orders. You can input a crazy number like 10000 pips for your TP levels. But you would then have to manage the trades yourself.  I have been testing this EA doing just that and closing on a equity %. I am using smaller grid steps and increasing trade size on up/down steps.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
haha

agreee about the martingale part.

it's intresting. but i think u can still improve it.. most of all it needs a appropriate SL. as a trader we must accept loss in this market.. then we can earn profit.

so im saying maybe u can set a good sl for trades to accept that this position is gone... lets do another !!

--- 帖子 #985 ---
hello, I'm using your EA v4-2, I wanted to know if the first news I have to stop the expert or not

--- 帖子 #986 ---
That is up to you. In my opinion, I think that this EA doesn't predict the trend so news can be just as much in your favor as against you. The thing is about stopping the EA expert for news is that it can be very difficult to stop it without being in any trades and to take a loss. A lot of news might not move the market much in relevance to your positions anyway if you are using a large grid size such as 100 or 200 pips. Some market news retraces back to near where the price was when the release of news occurred.

If I personally would be using it live, I would be using a 200 pip grid and not bother about news at all. Some people might trade it differently.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #987 ---
thanks for your kind reply

depends a bit on the news. For brexit-esque events I would stop trading.

you could automate the stop of 'expert in news with three bulls? perhaps even using my indicator that I am attaching?

you can also enter a stop loss such as when the loss comes to $ 50 closes all trades and start over

I'm going to test this. Have found a few Martingale EA's that seem to work in the past. Would always withdraw my initial deposit once it's doubled the account though, you never know

--- 帖子 #991 ---
This is not a martingale strategy. Its a grid trader. There is no mechanism to deal with draw down except time and the hope closing winning trades, keep you above water until the market reverses. In back testing it does pretty good in range markets, not so good in strong trends.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
I have test history and also do real trade with the live account, the strategy is ok. Work with h1, about 8-10 order per month, loss is maximum around 40 pips, profit may be up to 200-300 pips, rate of win: lot is 7:3 per month.

Great work man!The strategy involves taking BUY & SELL positions at the same time for each grid step. The strategy involves closing positions both profitable and non-profitable at a net profit during periods of retracement I found there is a difference between your EA and remon's.

closing positions both profitable and non-profitable

1 BUY&SELL every XX pips, same as remon's

2 let's say we have 10buy & 10sell with 10pips distance and the market went up 100pips

Remon's EA: close all buy when market go down 10 pips

Your EA : close buy orders with XX TP, that means in a trend you have only one order in right direction.

Have u ever thought about to use remon's exit strategy?

--- 帖子 #996 ---
hello, i read remon thread about 56 pages, and your thread about 10 pages. i downloaded  ea, and run at live cent account, but it is not working. i attached screen shots of inputs. plz explain inputs so the ea could work. hope you would so kind an explain. thanking in anticipation.

I think he mentioned the other week, he tried but Remon's didnt work out too well, or something or another? I brought it up the other week, the exit approach seemed appealing.

I think u might find that the slippage of 4, is a representation of "points" no?

--- 帖子 #999 ---
slippage of 4

that means 40 points or 4 points on 5-d brokers?

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
I can only think of 2 things that may have caused you not to enter trades.

1. Have you got a tick in Allow Live Trades

2. The EA only enters trades once it hits a round number

If your round number settings is at 200 pips, then it will only enter a trade at 110.00, 112.00, 114.00, etc... as an a example of the GBPJPY.

I have not noticed anything from your screenshots that would indicate the EA not working for you.

Many Thanks & Best Regards,

Daniel

Round numbers are simple to understand.

If you are using the grid so round numbers are 100 pips, then trades will only open every 100 pips at round numbers.

1.0100(0)

1.0200(0)

1.0300(0)

1.0400(0)

1.0500(0)

1.0600(0)

1.0700(0)

1.0800(0)

1.0900(0)

1.1000(0)

etc...

if it was 200 pips, trades would only open at round numbers

1.0000(0)

1.0200(0)

1.0400(0)

1.0600(0)

I've looked at your screenshot and you are using v4. What I have just said applies to v4-2.

I do advice that you use v4-2 just for ease of knowing how to use the EA but if you are keen to use v4, the round numbers work differently as they are not expressed in pips but they are expressed in fractions.

For the EURUSD and most non-JPY pair the round numbers work like this.

1.0000(0) - 1.0100(0) = 100 pips  / Setting for 100 pips is 0.0100

1.0000(0) - 1.0050(0) = 50 pips   / Setting for 50 pips is 0.005

1.0010(0) - 1.0020(0) = 10 pips  / Setting for 10 pips is 0.001

I hope you understand from this example or that you decide to upgrade to v4-2

Daniel

do you have DLL checked in the EA setttings tepu?

and if u have it set to a 100 grid, it wont open any trades until it finds the edge of that grid. lower it to like 5 for a little while to see if the EA starts

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Did a bunch of 6 month back tests this weekend (Jan-Jun 2016). This thing runs really slow in the tester so I kept them short. I used EUR/USD mostly but did run a few other pairs. Just some general thoughts if others want to run some too.

Larger grid size = less profit but less drawdown. Finding 100 grid works best for most pairs. 150 best for higher movers like GBP/AUD or GBP/CHF. Usually matching the TP to grid size yields the best profit/DD results. Smaller grids/TP might work good for a time but eventually will put you in deep draw down. I am more interested in a slow steady money maker.

One thing I tried was to increase the lot size for the BUY/SELL_LOT_GRID_STEP_UP: .02 and left DOWN at .01. I figured this would increase the profit but also the draw down. It did just that, but DD was still at a decent level on most tests.

Now here is the tests that really surprised me. By increasing the BUY/SELL_LOT_GRID_STEP_DOWN: .02 and leaving UP at .01 the EA actually performed much better.

The DD was slightly higher but a few percentage points for the profit gained was well worth it. The following is the 4 tests on EUR/USD with 4 different lot steps:

1. Grid size=100..TP= 100.. Grid_STEP_UP =.01..GRID_STEP_DOWN=.01 PROFIT: 283.33..MAX DD: 1.74%

2. Grid size=100..TP= 100.. Grid_STEP_UP =.01..GRID_STEP_DOWN=.02 PROFIT: 504.36..MAX DD: 3.22%

3. Grid size=100..TP= 100.. Grid_STEP_UP =.01..GRID_STEP_DOWN=.03 PROFIT: 720.55..MAX DD: 4.72%

4. Grid size=100..TP= 100.. Grid_STEP_UP =.01..GRID_STEP_DOWN=.04 PROFIT: 935.16..MAX DD: 6.20%

I found these results to be true on other pairs I ran also. Keep in mind this was only a 6 month test. The pairs that ran the best with these settings were E/U, NZD/CHF, NZD/CAD, AUD/CAD, CAD/CHF. One pair blew up with any settings and that was USD/CAD. Probably because it was in a very long trend with almost no retrace for the whole test. Faster movers like GBP/AUD, GBP/CAD did ok profit wise but had a higher DD of over 25%.

My guess is by going against the trend with a bigger lot size it gets the break even price closer for when the retrace happens and allows the basket of trades to close sooner. I really thought by averaging in like that it would blow up the draw down numbers but it really did not on most pairs I ran. Going to run some 2-3 year test over night and see what happens.

EDIT: Its late, not sure I explained that correct. In short if the step moves up in selling higher lot size, if step moves down im buying higher lot size.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Excellent observation & well explained. I wonder if this can be automated somehow for testing purpose. Such as, if the price is above daily moving average then sell positions at higher lot & if price is below MA then buy positions at higher lot.

Thank you.

hi,you are great！

whick currency pair, whick timeframe is best running for v4-2？

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
This is an excellent EA, keydcuck must be busy with other things and we must appreciate all the hard work and effort that keydcuk been doing freely to all FF community, but as he said before, for him, this is kind of a finished project, unfortunately for us, cause with all it's potential, definitely all the suggested improvements could turn this into a even better EA.

The relative drawdawn that is inherent to this strategy has discouraged keydcuk form making more improvements. What is impressive is that different BT have fantastic results. The only option that we have is to use some external EA's combined with piggy.

Good luck to all and let's keep this thread alive

I have been analyzing Shiva's forward test from post 587 with interest (I thank him for this). He used V.4 and all related documents including the set file are attached in his post. What I have found is quite interesting. The test was done on Gbpjpy & Usdjpy from 14 April 2016 to 9 May 2016. During my analysis I had a mindset that definitely Gbpjpy would outperform Usdjpy by a large scale. But to my surprise it was the opposite. Have a look at the following summary:

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
If it keeps adding during a drawdown, surely thats a martingale EA? Maybe I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I believe martingale means doubling or more the next order step. This EA have fix lot, maybe in a deep perspective, it ends up by working like martingale because it adds orders in up and down moves, but in my view it's not a pure martingale system.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
you have made a great ea. it made 20$ in just 30 minutes with settings i dont know i just entered blindly in v4 in sideway market, i dnt know how it will act in strong trending condition of 500-800 pips(5 digits). plz tell me its its input function and their explaination in detail so i can make profit with this great ea in real account. thanks. regards .

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
It averages in as the price goes against you. The logic being  there will be a reversal and the average price of your bad trades will be close enough to be hit for break even or small profit. It works pretty good until there is a long slow trend with only small retracements (see EUR/USD 2014 or the current state of USD/CAD).  That is where Piggy struggles.

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
hello everybody,

I might have solved the problem in trending markets by activating survive mode.

in green area, this ea always win.

Hello jonirrenicus, thanks for your ideia, I assume you are increasing buy lots in this example, step up, in a long trend, but what happens if the price falls back down again, can you explain a little better your strategy?

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Hello,

You tested which VS of EA?

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Hey mate, that is not a trend. Its a short term price spike. Piggy will handle that easily with no intervention. Even much bigger spikes than that. Do some visual back tests. It may make you more comfortable with how this EA works. Your idea is not without merit though. But to rescue every price spike you may as well just trade manual with no EA. Stop losses wont work either except to slow down your equity growth. When the price comes back from that spike you will have a locked in loss and no trades open to profit from the retracement. Its how the EA is supposed to work. Compare the chart you posted. You can see since you posted, GU came back down, went up even higher came back down again. If you had just left it alone you would have made profit from all those up/down moves. Stopping out you lose out on one direction. Plus you then have to start guessing what direction you should trade in.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Testing V4-2.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
Pretty sure he is increasing the sell lots as it goes up. That brings the average price up close to current price so he only need a small retrace to get break even or profit. That will work as long as you get a good enough retrace. Always hard to judge exactly just how close you need to get it. The down side is if you miss, things will get out of control very fast, because the next step you need even more lots = more risk. One idea that might help is throw up some B Bands or a vdub channel and only rescue when the price goes above the upper band. Nothing is fool proof though.

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Please enlarge the picture, cause you are not seeing it right, what I see in his picture is sell lots of 0,01 as the trend goes up and a buy of 0,15 higher than the sells...

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Thanks for your input!

You are right, no need to increase lot size. If we meet false breakout, it will be a great loss.

Could you not add a setting which closes the trades if it breaks the support/resistance line?

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
I am testing something close to that. Once I reach 1% equity growth I close out the whole grid and start over. Trading 2-4 pairs at once with a small grid/tp step. So far this week I have closed twice for a 2% equity bump. Still trying to decide what is best option for lot sizes on the up/down grid steps. Time will tell. Decide the pairs to trade by looking back a month or 2 and using the ones that look to be ranging the most.

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
That will result in a loss....my friend

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
you can do that already, there's two lots of buys and sells. in up trend, make sure buys is more than sells in an uptrend and vice versa.

Back Test results for GBPJPY for 1 year (22.05.15-21.05.16) with 200pips grid size and 50pips TP and 0.1lot size. I think DD is still considerable and scary. (Modelling quality 99.9%)

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
G/J was in 3 month fairly steep down trend when the drawdown happened. That is to be expected with this EA, it is the weakness. The problem with the strategy tester is you just throw on the pair and let it rip for a year with no intervention. Have to use discretion when trading this. Dont put it on a pair that is trending. If you were to forward test look back a month or 2 and only trade the pairs that are ranging. A trend can start at any time of course so its not fool proof.  If you want a good example of this, back test EUR/USD for 2014 and then for 2016. Big difference in results and if you look at a chart it will explain why. 2014 has a long drawn out trend and 2016 does not.

If you want to do more test keep your grid size/TP about equal.  It keeps a good balance between profit/Draw down.  If TP is set lower than grid  usually more DD. TP set higher usually less profit.

Thank you for mentioning the GBPAUD pair.

During times where I was following Mr Remon Reffat's thread I had found that the EURAUD and the GBPAUD pair were pairs that worked well with his first part of his Method 1 EA and it is something I haven't considered much of my own EA as I was a bit obsessed and still am sometimes of the GBPJPY due to its high volatility and ability to retrace large steps.

I am running a long backtest on the GBPAUD right now before I go to bed to see what results it may yield when it is done.

If there is anything worth mentioning about it, I will share it with the followers of this thread.

Thanks again.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
I have not worked with a news reader indicator before. I will hopefully see what I can do.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Yes, I must apologize to the thread followers that I haven't been actively posting as much as I feel that the EA itself has lost any better potential to what it can do in modification by myself. Again, I am mentioning it would have been good to see what a coder version of the EA would have been like, at least for the fun of it. It was disappointing to see a coder that has presented what they were going to do and then abandon it.

I appeal to any coder to try to produce a coder's version of the EA. I am quite happy to explain the method in which it trades. It is very easy to understand. From then if I have a volunteer, they might commit to see where any sort of filtering might lead the EA to perform better. At this point my opinion is negative but I have always stood in the hope that someone points me wrong.

I have been preoccupied in a couple of things, mainly another grid EA from another person's strategy which I am unable to share as I have been asked not to. My other project is to Binary Options trading EA. I am in forward testing and am happy to share things in the future hopefully about this. If there is anybody into Binary Options and would like me to work with their strategy ideas, I welcome them with open arms as I am of huge interest in BO. I think it carried less risk, lesser reward but overall safer to trade than traditional forex market.

PS: I also welcome anyone who has Renko strategies as I was close to being able to find something very successful with Nonlag MA & Nonlag Dot but unfortunately because of repaint issues with these indicators, my forward testing was not as good as backtesting what I thought was going to be producing around 700+ pips a month consistently. Just another lesson in not relying too much of backtests and especially with EAs that have indicators.

I can't explain anymore than what I have said to make it easier.

It is best you use v 4-2. It is the newest version that I have made and for a reason. It is simpler to understand and use for the user.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Although martingale strategy has different variables and you can adjust settings to it, in it simplest forms it simply doubles the lot position for every opposite  position it is losing against on a grid strategy or on a non-grid EA, it doubles the lot size every time it loses.

Having said this, the alternative setting for martingale work that it doesn't need to double as the multiply factor can be use in a constant variable. Example, it can be x 2.5 instead of x 2. Also, you can have a reset so that if a trade loses 6 times while it is doubling, it can be set as stop loss to not keep doubling but accept losses and start again at the first lot size trade.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
If you insist in using v4, there is a screenshot on post #1 that you can look at. Basically there is an input for each lot size that you can set when trading. As the strategy involves opening a BUY/SELL position every grid size step, there is only 2 directions to go UP or DOWN.

The settings are so that they can be set as follows

BUY Grid Step UP Lot Size

SELL Grid Step UP Lot Size

BUY Grid Step DOWN Lot Size

SELL Grid Step DOWN Lot Size

Round numbers also are explained in the screenshot.

Most NON-JPY Pairs

0.0001 = 1 pip

0.0010 = 10 pips

0.0100 = 100 pips

JPY pairs

0.01 = 1 pip

0.10 = 10 pips

1.0   = 100 pips

Unrealized Profit for BUYS in pips - All buy positions are converted from a monetary value regardless of size and position on chart to a pip value for closing

Unrealized Profit for SELLS in pips - All sell positions are converted from a monetary value regardless of size and position on chart to a pip value for closing

It is because of this and was not aware it could be done in programming that I made another version as this was complicated for a lot. Even the round numbers for me when I was programming.

Can anyone please advise on how to get this EA work again?

Piggy Knight? Is that your own creation?

Different size lots on your grid steps can increase profits. Try your EU test with .03 for buy-step-up and sell-step-down and .01 for the other 2 steps. Bet you get better profit with only few percent more DD.  Also like I mention in another post, the way it runs in the tester is not the way I would trade this EA. Just slapping it on a pair and letting it run forever.  Have to pick your pairs carefully (ranging, not trending when you start). Then monitor it close. Also the majors (EU,GU,UC,AU etc) dont do as well as the crosses. I found this thru many tests. Maybe they are too "trendy".

Im still doing a demo running 3 non correlated pairs and closing the grid once I hit 1% equity growth. I pick the pairs before I restart by looking back a few weeks at a 4 hour chart and take the ones that are ranging the most. I take non correlated pairs to keep from multiple pairs moving the same way at once. Still working on the grid sizes though. Got 3 closes for 3 % last week but the DD was a bit too high (4%) for my liking. So think I need to increase the gridsize . Mostly using 15-25 grid size and higher lots like I outlined to you above. Ill post on friday this weeks results.

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Seems ok to me. Probably just need to wait for the round number to kick in an have a trade open.

Hi Keydcuk,

first of all - thank you very much for your great EA!! I am also experimenting trying to keep DD low. I was thinking about running Piggy on multiple pairs at the same time in one account  (grid size 100pips and TP=100pips with high volatility pairs). Would hope that the pairs themselves keeping the overall drawdown at a reasonable level

If I run Piggy on multiple charts it is only grouping trades from one currency each at the same time. Is there a chance that you could please adjust Piggy that it would calculate groups to close based on all pairs

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
I run multiple pairs. Smaller grid size though. Usually 3 or 4 at one time. Just make sure they are not too correlated in case you get stuck in a DD period.  Not sure exactly what you are meaning by the group closure based on pairs. I close my grids at a certain equity point and start again. Piggy is not capable of that so you would need a 3rd party EA.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
there are so many ea's in this forum... someone could add the close_profit ea with input parameter variable how to profit.

this ea is made with a software panel online. probably it is not confortable to do this option.

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
I don't know if this will do what you are looking for but you can give it a try and let us know your testing.

You will need to enter whatever currency pairs you are using in the exact format that your broker has them in your MT4 without using any spaces.

Example:

EURGBPecn,GBPUSDecn,GBPJPYecn

It is important that you use the same format and also no spaces between commas or it has no chance of working. In the past, I struggled a bit with a multi currency EA I tried to build but please give this a go and let us know how it works out.

Daniel

You can set this to close all your open trades at a specified equity target.

Hi Keydcuk,

thanks a lot! Could you also be please so kind and upload the mq4 file to the multicurrency EA? Currently trying to learn coding and would like to understand better what has been changed by the program you're using

Some questions regarding the mechanism of the multi-currency ea

- I put them just on one chart and indicate in the settings which pairs they should trade on, right?

- I saw the Piggy creates "baskets" of profitable and unprofitable trades and closes them at the same time. If I run the multi-currency trade EA and e.g. I trade EURAUD and CHFJPY at the same time. Assuming that I have positive EURAUD left and some negative CHFJPY. If I put the normal Piggy on two separated charts (one EURAUD and the other CHFJPY) it will always manage both currencies individually. Does the Multi currency piggy manages all trades together as one "big virtual" grid thus looking for groups of positive and negative trades from all pairs simultaneously?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
thanks.

Update....

July 25 to July 29

On Wed. July 27, the account balance doubled from when the demo started.

Therefore,I increase the lot size to 0.02.

DD for the week did not exceed 15%

Profit for the week was +13.56%

Accumulated profit is now +111.35%

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
Nice results Gold. Do you still use the settings from post 938? Do you trade just A/U? Are your draw down stats real time or just when a position closes like the strategy tester? I am trading a set up like yours except I am running multiple pairs at once. Using a 5k demo though. Only difference is my TP settings are always equal to or a few pips lower than the grid size. Figure less open positions in the red if price turn against you.

Only trading this way for few weeks but happy with the results. I did alot of testing on this EA, so I came up with my own ideas how to trade this. My 2 screens below is my acct info for July and the equity graph. The one spike down early on was more my fault than the EA. Forgot to take my comp off sleep mode so there was a bunch of built up trades that were not managed. The EA did manage to rescue me from my own stupidity!!

I tested the Piggy EA, results are good but the equity curve falls too much. Its practically dangerous. A little more fall and account is blown. Only suitable if accont size is large enough.

For small account size this EA TCL1 is much better. Check out here what other members have their view on this...
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...18#post9058418

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
"Its practically dangerous". Interesting. Your EA shows a 68% DD and you dont consider that dangerous. Not to mention the only results you show is few tradse over small time period. A new user jumping into other threads to promote their "still in progress" EA runs up red flags. Perhaps your intentions are good but you should start your own thread and not troll others. I have not experienced large DD using piggy. Its not set and forget, you need to manage it constantly.

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
Sorry for the old test result. Current dd is max 39%.

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
Getting better. I would have to take a look. I could cherry pick many tests on piggy that make it look like a millionaire maker.  But one test is not reality. I hope your 100 starting balance is just for testing? There is no way any sane person would trade a grid system with that low a balance, even at .01 lots. If your max DD in that short time frame is more than your starting balance, you just got lucky the account was not blown up.

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
to me this kind of  ea must test in cent accounts or big demo accounts

first of going real and lose all the money

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
thorn,

1).New settings is in post#952...TP 30(Buy & Sell) , RoundNumbersPips to 20.

2).Yes, only AU.

3).I take the max DD for the whole week.

Good luck !

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
Thanks Gold. Good luck to you also. A/U looks like a good choice. Slight up trend for the year, but enough retraces to keep you raking in the pips.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Hi Keydcuk,

one question - somehow the EA is not opening any trade despite running on multiple pairs. Anyone else also having the same problem?

Thanks for your help!

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
Did you set on the input your trading pairs? Also, be aware of the default setting of grid size. It may not have hit a round number.

I am going to try it myself. I have not tried it. I don't know if it will work. I have not done a multipair EA that works correctly yet.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
I know this seems like madness but i will really trade with a small live account of $100. This system is not a grid trading entirely. Its a composite of multiple strategy interlocked with one another to form a optimal strategy as per the real market scenario. Grid is just a part of it. If you observe correctly, it will not take all trades with the grid size you have mentioned in the settings. Once it starts trading all the settings change internally until profit is obtained.

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
D.s I kindly ask you to stop spamming other threads with your EA. Please don't get offended, i find your EA interesting, but if you want to discuss it please create a thread about it.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
No offence... sorry if it disturbed you. thanks for suggesting. I will create a separate thread.

Hi Daniel, thanks for your great EA. I am currently doing extensive backtest on your EA using optimzation feature in MT4, however because of too many variables it takes weeks to finish backtest due to hundredes of passes. I wonder if you could merge some parameters into one as we normally set take profit for buy/sell equally and lot size is also equally for Sell Step down/Buy step up. My suggestion is like the attached picture:

Attached Image

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
The other version is good in case you want to put weight to the buy and sell  positions going in grid trend, but here is the simple version of the EA.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
Thanks for the simple version Daniel. This EA generate great results with big grid size and low TP as it makes room to increase lot sizes. During my backtests I noticed that with TP around %30 of Grid size we can increase Buy_Lot_Grid_Step_Up/Sell_Lot_Grid_Step_Down together as well as Sell_Lot_Grid_Step_Up/Buy_Lot_Grid_Step_Down. As you mentioned, by putting weight on buy and sells we get better results, So according to the screenshot I attached we still need to have two lot sizing parameters separately in order to put weight. So Ea could have two parameter for lot sizing and one for TP (3 instead of 6).

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Sorry, I looked at your screenshot too quickly.

Here's the attached.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Thanks very much Daniel for prompt building that. Just to confirm with you, In your new description:

Trend_Lot_Size=Buy_Lot_Grid_Step_Up/Sell_Lot_Grid_Step_Down

AntiTrend_Lot_Size=Sell_Lot_Grid_Step_Up/Buy_Lot_Grid_Step_Down

is that right?

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
looking so at the first there is a space more in the world st ep is step

if you leave the space the variable name is not valid

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Yes, this is right.

Daniel, I did optimization test but with the best setting on simplified version I get completely different results on original version. MT4 platform has been disconnected from broker during backtest then nothing has changed for both tests. Here is the results:

It seems that there is somthing wrong in grid size calculation in simplex version.

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
I don't know what to say as there is very little changes from one version to another. They both have the same configuration as far as blocks go and the inputs have simply been amalgamated as per what you were looking for. The only difference I noticed that was different is that the TP settings were set to be a sum of profit to pips greater than the input setting and I have changed it to what it should have been which is greater or equal to the input setting. This should bare no great change in the test results. I don't know what else to think about other than if the grid size is a bit smaller, then MT4 might simulate PA differently on both tests but this still should be not much different as it is only a grid and not an EA based on indicators.

If I knew what I could do to help, I would. I don't think there is anything I can help with as both EAs are pretty much the same.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
Hi,

did it work with you?

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
Thanks for your clarification Daniel. If you would test both EA's with identical setting you will see this dramatic difference. Data has been imported from tickstory so tests has been done with highest quality of data and broker should be disconnected on MT4 platform to avoid live conversion rates and spreads.

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
Now trading live , first results are surprising.

After the quantative easing anouncement yesterday a spike appeared down on GBP/USD. My sell positions closed at a loss ?!?

So what happened...

- Close order was send from my comp to the broker

- By the time broker received the close, the market had jumped back

- Due to the spike, the spread was increased.

My ideas to improve on this; can we maybe add the following functionality

- is there a type of order that sais: "Close at this level, or do not close the position" Some sort of "pending close". Maybe update the limit level of the orders instead of closing?

- Incorporate the spread-cost in the take profit? ie: if take profit is set at 50, then new take profit would be spread+take profit

I did not notice this type of behaviour during my testing. Even in the brexit event it did not occur. Apparently, test-environment is not as production-like as I thought it was.

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
Guys

Try this at $10k balance.

UPTREND LONG = 0.03 lots

UPTREND SHORT = 0.01 lots

DOWNTREND LONG = 0.01 lots

DOWNTREND SHORT = 0.03 lots

Net TP = 30

Rounding = 20

Here's my results after 60 days or so, you'll be surprised

Hello FXCyborg, I like your idea. I think that concept in trending situation will work. Maybe in ranging also, gonna test it.

Hey guys! I have a question about an EA I am looking to develop. I'm new to coding and am having a couple problems with getting it to work correctly.

Here is the setup, it's very simple,

Renkos and Triangular Moving Averages.

I simply would like a position automatically taken on the first band with option to set SL and TP for different pairs. This is currently a 1p renko so for ex. I would proably have a stop of 4-5p and a target of 8-10p. This is incredibly effective for 2p renkos aswell where Sl and Target will also be a little higher.

I have been manually trading this strategy on several pairs and it has been very profitable. Can anyone help? It's probably not difficult to do, I just don't have the experience.

Thanks in advance!

You can contact me at { email address deleted by staff }

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Tested those settings in past and they worked well with a larger grid step (100). How was the drawdown with a small 20 pip grid? In backtest I always found such small steps will eventually kill the account once a drawn out trend happens.

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
Hi Everyone,

I started testing the EA on Friday and basically just trying to get a feel for it with the stated inputs (from post 22 and 37).  Weird this is, on EURUSD and GPBUSD, using version 4-2, if I have my settings as shown in the attachment, no positions are ever opened, no matter how much price action there is.

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong? If I use 0.5 or 2.0 as the round number, a crazy number of positions are opened.  Way too many I think.

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Put whole numbers in the RoundNumberPips parameter.

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
Cheers mate, figured that out a few minutes before I saw your post.  Not so fast and furious now which is likely a good thing.

I do have another question - how come I can never backtest this EA? Everytime I try it simply finishes with having taken no trades.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
No, this never worked for me. I don't know why I can't get multipair to work right. It is not something that has ever been successful with EAs I have tried programming.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
Hi,

I am wondering this EA works on any pair of currency?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
In version 4-2, you just need to put round numbers in pip value and nothing else. If you use 0.5, the grid size is 0.5 pips, 2.0 is 2.0 pips. If you are looking for 50 pips or 200 pips, you simply need to use 50 or 200 at the round numbers input.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
Yes, there should be no problem with any currency that your MT4 supports.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
I am trying on yadix demo account. I have the EA running however, in MT4 it says EA initialized, however no trade was made so far.

wont last too long...  ive already gave up on this system

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Again my orders were not closed at the same level in a live account, resulting in a small net loss instead of a profit;

Do you have any suggestions on how we can deal with this?

I already mailed my broker for advice (fxcm) but am waiting for reply)

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
Happens in demo also. Only seen this with many open orders and a quick price move. May just be the speed the EA closes trades. Price may be moving faster than the EA can close them?

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
The price is moving up. If the EA was too slow, it would close at higher pricelevels, and thus increasing profit.

I think it is the broker-side. That the orders are maybe closed too quickly, and the broker only finds a market at lower levels.

Or I could increase the take-profit setting. That would require another round of backtesting and optimisation on my part.

Or we could instead of closing the trades, edit the take profit /stop loss level of each open trade?

Since the take-profit level is a property of the trade, and the trade "lives" on the broker side, I expect that a take-profit level is executed from the broker side and not from the client side. And this should more or less guarantee a result which is closer to the objective?

I am not sure if it is possible to update the TP levels of all orders so close to market price? Or if we can change the EA to do this?

Update: had a reply from the broker. very helpfull. First suggestion was liquidity issue and an explanation on how liquidity functions.

Still, I think with a major pair and no big news event, a big broker would have enough liquidity on the major pairs to service a mini account?

Do you happen to know where can I find detailed logs so I can check if the close-order command was send at the same (mili)second from my MT4 client?

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
Honestly, I think it works - I am running it on a demo for AUDUSD with TP 30Pips and Distance of 20Pips now for 2 months on a VPS 24/5.

Result overall is not bad. Generated ~3,300 pips in two months which could be higher if it would not stuck in a larger drawdown the last 2-3 weeks due to the strong trending phase. But in the end it recovered.

If I do some simple math would say that I could make some 1500-2000pips per months which means with a 0.01 lot settings, I could make some 200 EUR per months.

Max drawdown in this time period was 5000pips (=in the end 500 EUR) but most of the time it is around 1000-1500 pips. Max trades open ~60

So if I am conservative I could use 1K account which should not be blown-up in the end and let it run making some 200 EUR per month which is 20%/month. For better money management in case I would like to increase my exposure I would a new account and start a new session of Piggy to bring some variance in my overall piggy-portfolio.

I think this EA is in the end really promising.

@Egosuma, Goldcourse: What are your thoughts on your experiences made so far with this EA?

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
Small grid size = good profits/ large DD..Large grid size = slow profits/ smaller DD..There is no way around this basic issue. At least not one I have found.

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Even in demo, I have observed that trades take losses when a group of trades close in large numbers. It is not unique to a live environment. Although I am not sure why this happens, I can only think it to be of 2 reasons.

1. In large numbers the programming behind the EA cannot calculate well the translation of P/L amount to pips when many positions are open.

2. Somehow when many positions are open, there is some sort of spread issue that happens where spread is greater than TP.

Whether it is for one or two of these reasons or something else, I am not sure but this is the only answer I can come up with.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
As I stated before, I was using piggy, but this also happened to me many times, with positions closing at a loss, specially when we use different sized lots in up or down movements. I believe somehow piggy can't transform the pip value to money to close them in profit. For now I'm using Antitrend EA based on remon's theory, that behaves similar to pigggy, one chart with only buy and one chart with only sell. I don't have this close positions at loss issue now cause it as the TP in money.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
permission download thank you for sharing

0.01 lot setting for 1K account is definitely not for my appetite.

You will encounter very high DD at some point.

Ideally for me, 3K for 0.01 lot .

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Like said my max DD was ~5000 pips. And the trend in the last week was quite consistent...  what was your max DD in pips?

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
Regarding the issue where orders were not closed in the same level:

I investigated the logfile.

The closing of the open buy positions took 13 seconds.There were +/- 50 orders to be closed.

In this 13 seconds the price fluctuated. This would have caused the unexpected result.

Is there a way we can speed up the closing of orders? especially if there are multiple?

Or other suggestions are also welcome of course ?

The logfile does shows that the orders are processed in sequential order.

Does this mean that the MT4 engine waits until it received confirmation on the first order is closed before it sends out the close of the second one? Or is this behaviour imposed by programming?

maybe a tricky solution to minimize the impact:

open one position in the other direction where lotsize is the total amount of all other positions, then you can close all the order including the negative one?

This would come at the cost of a spread, and I am unsure if it is even possible to do this? (since we already have buy&sell positions open).

We would need to work with different magic numbers, one for opening, one for closing.....

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
August to date results. Not as impressive as Gold but Im trading small and trying to control DD. I am not trading Piggy like you guys. Because I am in the U.S and my oppressive overlords say I can not buy and sell at the same time. So bi-directional grid trading is out unless I want to visit a shady off shore, which at this time I would rather not. So if I do decide to go live with a small live account it will be with Oanda or FXCM. I can however, go 2 hours down the road and blow my life savings at the Foxwoods roulette wheel if I want. Thank God my government knows how to protect me from myself.

Anyway, I am gridding in one direction only. Instead of looking for ranging pairs, which piggy trades well, I now look for trending pairs and grid with the current trend. I look mostly at 4 hour/daily for the trend. I trade a basket of 4 pairs at once. It was not hard to set the EA up to do this. I dont have set tp targets. As the EA runs I close out winners and sometimes some longer term losing trades to keep the DD in check. This works out well as I can get some good profit if a pair runs for a bit. I also have an EA that closes all trades once a certain equity target is hit (usually 1% gain). This works well also as once the target is hit, it cleans out the whole grid and stops trading. This allows me to pick my next set of pairs to use and restart the grid. Today finishes 3rd week of testing, max DD for the period is 3.86%. I can live with that.

I am using a smaller grid size now. You are right about the MM. Had to go a bit more conservative to make the smaller grid work. 20-50 depending on pair. Small account (5k) and 50:1 leverage. Trade Multiple pairs(3-5)/small lot size, trade in one direction only. Using a U.S broker so no hedging. Thought this would be a difficult work around but I actually prefer the one direction grid over Bi-directional. Usually trade in direction of major trend but sometimes will trade bounces off support areas. Have a large TP target but usually end up managing the trades manual few times a day. If I hit my daily Equity target I close down the whole grid and restart fresh.  Not a fan of set and forget EA's. Will post final results for month tomorrow. Currently at 8% growth/no open trades ATM. Max DD 6%. Not spectacular I know, but its steady and safe so far.

This is my test on 20 roundnumber pipsize.

The first -500 pips day is because i manually closed like 100 trades because i put 0.5 pip roundnumbersize >.>

It looks ok but I have 20 short positions opened atm and not sure how its gonna work out....DD is kinda big as well.

Any tips?

Hi KeyDcuk,

one question - I am running Piggy now for a month also one 10 multi pair (higher volatility pairs) but with large grid sizes of 100 (and TP=100). All in all good results and DD is reasonable. However I would like to apply a general trade manager who does the Piggy way of closing baskets of profitable and non-profitable trades for my perspective in a good way. Can you briefly explain the logic Piggy is doing to identify the right open trades to close? I tried to analyze the mql4-code but as you mentioned due to machine-generation of the source code, it is rather complex...

Thanks,

hi very good strategy but on mt4 version build  1010 non open position

can you fix problem?

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
There is no problem to fix. EA works fine with version 1010.

Hey can you tell me on what currency you run it? and PIPenter space and pip tps in ur settings?

EA on GBP/JPY destroyed my demo account 3 times now with different settings..

edit: see picture in my post above... if price moves in a trend, EA leaves alot of anti-trend positions opened until I reach margincall...

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
See post #952. I think he comes here only to post results now. Keep in mind those settings are for AUD/USD.  Stay away from G/J with a Bi-directional grid. It wont work well with its high daily range and 300-500 pip trends with no retraces. Stick with pairs that range only few hundred pips over the last couple months.

Goldcourse has done well since A/U has been in a 600 pip range since he started with no long trends. G/J in that same time period has a range of over 3000 pips, with some long non stop trends. If Gold traded his settings on G/J he would have killed his account long ago.

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
Thanks for the answer!!

I used GJ but will try AU since monday, will post results!

Have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
Hello Keyduck, I know that this EA is kind of a finished business to you, but a lot of us are still using it, and with some success.

In order to lower the DD, I really need your help to change the opening step positions, so it wont repeat opening positions in the same step.

I believe you have mentioned before that one of the first versions would do this, but I was never able to make it work because of the round number settings.

Could you please make a version of the v4-2 EA, so it just open one position at each step?

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
Hello everyone,

I put the Piggy in live-4.2 version in AUDUSD 5m. In demo it works well. But in livel when I was many orders, I closed lost me.

I used this setting:

Does anyone know somebody that could make a version of Piggy 4-2 that only opens one order at each step?

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
Hello,

Sorry for the bit of late reply. I am not going much of FF anymore as I have turned my attention to Binary Options at the moment.

As for your question, the trades close at the TP level. If it is trending and TP is 10 pips, it will close each trending position of 10 pips. Then, for each position that is opposing the trend and is left open, the EA will wait for a retracement to happen as far and as many positions open where net profit in money gets converted to this example of 10 pips.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
Sorry, this is not something I can easily do if at all. The way the EA works is that if it reaches a new grid step then it can reopen a new position at the same level during retracement. I wish I could help more. Sorry again!

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
Hello Daniel, tanks for your answer, it's a pity if nobody can work this out, it would be much helpful. I understand your answer, but sometimes, the retracement it's not enough, and with the little steps up or down, it keep adding to losing positions. I know this happens because I'm running a tight grid, but my strategy been working till now, and could be better with this little tweak. Oh well, thanks anyway and good luck.

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Have you tried possibly adding heavier positions to the trend move like 0.02 lots in the trend and only 0.01 lot in the hedge of the grid step? When I tested this in backtest, it was mixed results in large grids. The profit factor was going up much better with only a little of added DD. I did not test it in tight grid.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
What exactly do you mean by it needs proper optimization?

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
Hello Daniel, I'm using your EA in a little different way, cause I don't have a TP defined in the EA. I use your weighted different lot option that you mention in your post, but I let the trend run, and close all the positions in profit after 100 or 200 pips. Then I leave the retracement do it's own thing. If the orders wont repeat in previous steps, the DD would be smaller. I hope i have make myself understandable.

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
I have tweaked one of my EAs to add this option of no trades nearby which may do what you are looking for.

Let us know how this pans out.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
Perfect Daniel, thanks a lot for all your help and all your contribution to the Forex Comunity. Will test it and let everyone know of the results.

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
thanks for your sharing . anyway why you turn attention tu Binary ? is Binary more profitable or more easy ? thanks for your information.

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
I have looked at binary because I believe there is less risk in the trading environment. No matter how many pips you go positive or negative, it is still the same payout.

Although a good stop loss and take profit can be used in forex, I just like the idea that if you have 1 positive pip or 50 pips, it's the same payout. The similar occurs in the negative pips, it's a fixed loss rather than counting pips.

It is better for me as I am one that struggle to close positions at loss and keep to stop losses I put in place. This is one of the reasons I decided to pour in my ideas into EAs instead of the wasted hours I have put into manual trading. Manual trading can pay off but there was too much screen time for me and I never had a good chance to enjoy life as much as I should have.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
Hello Daniel, have tested your tweaked version, but it stills reopen orders at each step. Maybe a 10 pip grid(that's what I'm using) is to tight for the tweak you have implemented.

I know like the example below, that if the prices go up, the reopened buy orders help in the retracement, to close the buy orders opened above. But i don't need this, cause i trade in a different way and most of the time I manually close the orders. So if the price continues to go down the reopened buy orders will add to the DD.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I could use remon's(idea) trend-anti trend EA, cause it doesn't reopen orders on previous step, but it doesn't have the ability to change the lot's size in buy or sell mode like your's does.

Maybe if you had a partial profit on new orders? In the above example, each new buy opened on a previous step would close for profit for example...

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
Hi Daniel,

How do you input this settings ? Is it like this

In uptrend ----> Buy Lot grid step UP 0.02, Sell Lot grid step UP 0.01

In downtremd ---->  Buy Lot grid step DOWN 0.01, Sell Lot grid step DOWN 0.02

So in UPtrend it will take a higher buy size and hedged position will be smaller and vice versa ?

Am I right ?

Thanks

Shane

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
That's exactly right. 😀

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
Thanks for the quick reply ... I tried it in another way like UPtrend buy 0.02 but sell 0.00 and vice versa but it still took hedge positions inspite of it being 0.00

Any idea why ?

Thanks

Shane

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
You are correct. Your buy/sell-lot-steps should always be higher following the price. So for example if you set buy-lot-grid-step up at .02 then sell-lot-grid-step down should also be set at .02. The other 2 settings remain at .01. I have done many back tests on the grid step settings and grid sizes for many different pairs. The 2:1 ratio always comes out on top.

You cant set the grid step to 0...01 is the minimum. Im not a programmer so not sure if there is a way around that.

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
It won't take a position at 0 lots. It will always take the minimum it can get if you set it to 0 lots.

Somewhere in the thread there is a version that does what you describe as it only buys up an sells down.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
Yes, the 4aa does that.

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
Thanks guys ... will look up 4aa

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
Thanks Daniel for your opinion. Is there spesific strategy about binary trading do you use ?

I just wonder why binary trading not so familiar like trading forex ? any way thanks alot for your kind for helping people. wish all the best

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
At the moment, I am using a method involving RSI. Binary has not been out there very long and I think the forex community has a harder time embracing it. What I am exploring at the moment is martingale. For as much as I am against it in forex, I think there is room for it in binary because of it's fixed wins and if there is a strategy that can say yield no more than 3 or 4 losers in a row, you could really make a lot of money consistently using a martingale strategy.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
Thanks for your explanation . some one i know also trading binary using "martingale " strategy also and his account grow well .

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
Could you please let us know how the EA is doing now? IS it still giving you pips? Also like to ask you about your setting for the GJ pair. ihave used it with good results. 5% return in one week with hardly any draw down. I like to demo on a large lot size of 0.3 on a 50 K account. The TP and rounding can be still kept at 30 and 20 respectively?

Thanks

Sep 12 to Sep 16

DD for the week reached 68%

Profit for the week was +8.13%

Accumulated profit is now +166.19%

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
Stats from start (Aug 4 2016)

Week ending sep 16..

Profit week: +1.46%

Profit month: +4.33%

Profit from start: +12.91%

Draw down week: 17.45% (high)  1.48% (current)

Draw down Max from start: 17.45%

All my pairs conspired against me this week. Probably worst case scenario to get into. Still able to keep DD under 20% which is my goal. Recovered nicely by weeks end. I was hoping to encounter a situation like this to see how the EA would recover from the price not behaving as I expected. Plain and simple my market analysis was dead wrong this week. First time that happened since start. Probably wont be the last either, so this week was good learning experience.

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
Wow! That's a lot of DD.

Daniel

--- 帖子 #1184 ---
yeah, I was thinking the same, lots of DD

No pain, no gain I guess

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
Yes, I wouldn't trade this live with small account balance.

--- 帖子 #1186 ---
I have been testing this EA for a month now. I must say that even in the extreme situtaion with GY now, this EA has not created a DD more than 5%. Returns 10% / 2 weeks on bigger lots and 10%/ month on .01 lots. Like this EA. I use settings suggested by FxCyborg.

--- 帖子 #1187 ---
HELLO FELLOW FOLLOWERS!

I am messaging you to say that I am leaving forex factory. I have decided to look at what Binary Options may or may not bring on a live account and possibly use the Piggy n The Middle EA in the future if I dare to be brave enough.

Please be aware that I do not recommend PnTM on live accounts for either legal reasons or even sound advice as I have seen nothing in backtest other than to prove to myself that eventually there would be an extreme DD period and that you would need about 7000 or maybe even more just to be trading 0.01 lot, however some people have traded it slightly different than a set and forget EA in this thread.

I wish you the best of will for those who are using it that it pays off the debts that may have accumulated over your time trading in the past.

May the Peace of Our Lord Jesus Christ Bless you all!

Please note that the mq4 files should be fine to edit if you are using the Fxdreema software to modify the strategy.

Good luck Daniel. One of the best grid traders I ever tried. You are right about the set and forget. It can be used in other ways however. It is just a tool and a very good one if used properly. I continue to test it on demo using my own methods and it has worked very well. Hope your future ventures are profitable.

Hello,

Since we are more eager to go after a grid of 5 instead of 200, why not:

a.  Before activating the EA, make sure the market is sideway, at least at M5 for 1 hour or more, whatever the sideway range for that previous 1 hour or more may be;
b. IF no strong moves (100-200 pips) followed by 50% retracement takes place within a specified period, say 2 hours after the EA having been activated, close all, deactivate the EA and re-start the EA once condition (a) above is met;
c. IF after a strong move (up or down 100-200 pips), no 50% retracement takes place within 15 minutes up to 1 hour, cut your loss, close all and start all over again once condition (a) above is met. IF you get your 100%-127% retracement, close all, deactivate the EA and withdraw your profits for the day.

My hypothesis is that: IF we give a time limit for the anticipated retracement to take place, we will not be run down and the account be blown away by a strong 100-200 pips moves because of the silly 5 pips grids.

Cheers,
Safuan

P/S This is my 1st post here and I have been reading up to page 34 since 2 days ago. Count me in pls.

--- 帖子 #1195 ---
Who exactly is more eager? I do not remember anyone in this thread advocating a 5 pip grid. Even on a slow moving pair I would never have anything less than a 20 pip grid size. Try testing GBP/JPY with a 5 pip grid and see what happens. As for your scenarios, you would need to monitor the EA constantly. Like 24/7. This is why I dont trade this EA bi-directional. Way too much work.

--- 帖子 #1196 ---
The discussions in this thread would have been straight forward if participants just forward test the default setting; 200 pip grid, 100 TP. I spent more than 50 hours since 3 days ago reading up to page 49 and u know what...  it seems to me that numerous versions were posted just so that grid 5-25 pips could be tested and failed, and I came across 1 instance of a new participant back then blowing a demo account in below 24 hours because he/she used a 5 pips grid.

Me? Eager? Yes, I am eager to apply an EA to my chart on my own terms so that I don't have to manually set the limit orders, stop orders at certain levels/grids and partly my terms are as stated in my previous post.

I don't believe that EA shoud run 24/5. And for me 2 hours into London open and another 2 hours of NY would be enough. Some day I win, some day not. Its a fair expectation, and I know I can't win every trading day. Rather than having huge DD, I'd rather cut loss after a specified hours of Euro/NY markets.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
I think this kind of grids  you can only set and forget if you set a large grid size backtesting

in about 10 years if you want to survve your account. anyway you can also limit the grid size but

you can limit the number of operations in the grid. if you have few operations when the market flows in your favour

you hit the take profit. I prefer smaller grid size but limit the number of operations.

--- 帖子 #1198 ---
Interesting take on grid trading. I always thought of grids more long term. Did you trade it today? As long as the ranging days out number the trending days you should do ok I think.

--- 帖子 #1199 ---
Hi all,

Just wanted to let you know of performance of this EA when the black swan event of 800 pip crash to GY happened today. It survived. Losses on my demo account was at 1%. I ran 10,000 USD for a 0.01 lot account. So I am still 14% up since the account opened one month ago (15% to 14% profit)- Not bad.

Regards

Haemdoc

--- 帖子 #1200 ---
Can you please share your settings please. I plan to use the Piggy EA with real money soon. I think it has a clever way of trading and will make through with a proper MM.

Great to hear it has survived the shock.

--- 帖子 #1201 ---
I have used the settings by fxcyborg

You can see that on one of the earlier pages. One thing that helped the account was a small lot size 0.01 for 10000 usd account. Do let me know if you can't find the settings. Thanks

Here it is

I must say that you don't get that kind of return. I saw 10% per month.

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
Thanks haemdoc. I think I got the settings as shown below:

On a 10,000$ account:

UPTREND LONG = 0.03 lots

UPTREND SHORT = 0.01 lots

DOWNTREND LONG = 0.01 lots

DOWNTREND SHORT = 0.03 lots

Net TP = 30

Rounding = 20

GBP/JPY

v4.2

I would appreciate if you could clarify the TP & rounding figures are they in pips or points (i.e. 300 & 200 OR 20 & 30).

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
hello is possible   (ea Piggy) with micro suffix?

Tks

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
If you are using version 4.2 rounding is in pips. So 20 is 20 pips. Same with TP. I would caution using that small of a grid on GBP/JPY or any pair that has a high daily range. The wonderful results that the above poster got on last nights spike is just a pipe dream on a real account. There would have been slippage/frozen platform/off quotes etc. You dont get all that fun stuff in demo.

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Yes..At least the ones I have tested it works fine.

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
Thanks thorn. Very clear. Did not notice that V4.2 has the input values in pips unlike the previous version.

I will be avoiding GBP pairs once starting my live trading. During testing I have found that USDJPY is stable with consistent profits.

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
Any pairs that are ranging work the best. Just pull up a daily chart and its easy enough to see. Take GBP/AUD for example. No way you would want to put a bi-directional grid on that pair. I only trade in one direction since I am in U.S and cant hedge, so I do the opposite and look for trending pairs.. Gridding E/G long this week and made some nice profit. But it was demo and no slippage/off quotes to deal with so in real life probably would not have made as much. You can check my acct link in my profile.

Also don't rule out testing piggy as a one directional grid. Because I cant hedge I had no choice but to configure a strategy to do that. I have found I like it better than the Bi- directional grid. Follow the longer term trend and grid in that direction. Its a bit more complicated to explain how I pick the pairs but if you are half way decent at seeing trend lines and S/R levels you increase the odds of getting into the right direction at the right time. It also helps to have acct size big enough to trade multiple pairs at once. I tend to trade 4 pairs at any given time. So since I am pretty good at picking the right direction I can close out some of my losing trades by off setting with winners if I need to.. Its kind of a continuous balancing act but it keeps the draw down in check. I set equity targets for my acct and once I reach the target I close down the whole grid and start fresh with a new set of pairs. Flushing out the system so to speak. So the EA makes the trades but I do a lot of intervention to manage the trades. Grid trading is all about maintaining a fairly smooth equity curve and not letting DD get out of control.

Best of luck..

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
I have not tested the EA, and if possible, I would not want to go into hedging in the first place.

After reading some great ideas in this thread, I believe by focusing more on momentum indi such as AO and basically using M15 as momentum bias (let say sell when M15 AO bars are below level 0) and M5 4th-5th bar above level 0 as entry sell signals. At least that how I get my signals. In the past, I used to go into the strength of the trend only to be caught selling at the bottom/buying at the top, but since I applied the idea of utilising momentum in my trading, my entry points had improved and I am very happy about it. As to exit points, I use M1, when in Sell, I close my entries after 4-5 bars of AO M1 below level 0.

The idea behind the Piggy EA is great, but we can always improvised because most of the time market are ranging, at least 10-25 pip a few times every day. Of course there will be times when we could be caught in a sudden strong intraday trend. Thats why, I don't stay in a trade for too long and 4-5 bars of AO M1 as exit signal is all that I need to stay focus and content.

I wish all of you success, and could find ways to stay profitable and avoiding huges losses or prolonged DD.

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
Success to you also. Grids are easy to set up and you dont need to stare at the screen all day. I have a day job so it works for me. Been testing different grid systems for long time and all the pure mechanical ones fail at some point or you get huge emotion killing DD that would make you pull the plug. That is why I switched to a half EA/half me type system. You seem to favor the same approach so Im sure you will figure a way to make it work.

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
Dear thorn

Can you share your settings for the non hedged version of EA that you are currently using? Also please mention which version of EA you are using.

Thanks

haemdoc

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
Same here, which is still a very good result and certainly nothing to discard.

But it will require a strong attitude, even the safest of settings can (and probably will) blow your account eventually.

Plan your strategy accordingly when using this.

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
Using version 4-2. To make it non-hedged you need to go to common tab a pick "only long" or "only short" depending on which way you want to go.  Since piggy is designed to open both ways you may see an error in your experts tab saying that a trade was not allowed. This is ok because it is stopping either the long or the short from executing. Exactly what you want. Settings vary depending on pair traded. My rule of thumb for grid spacing is ADR/3. So for example if ADR is 100 grid size is 100/3 = 33.33. I like to round up to next zero so I would grid that pair at 40. For more volatile pairs like gbp/aud, gbp/cad etc. I like a larger grid so ADR/2. Even for slow moving pairs I tend not to use anything less than 25  for grid. My biggest period of draw down was caused by me using too small a grid for the pair I was trading. For TP,  usually go with 2x the grid size + 10. So if I am doing a 25 pip grid 25x2+10=60. I mostly use that so if a pair gets a decent run my way I want to bank it before it retraces. Many times though I may close out earlier or set TP higher if I think it will keep going. Since I trade multiple pairs I am more interested in the overall P/L of the whole basket not just one pair. If I was to trade just one pair I would probably set the TP a bit lower, maybe 1.5 x grid size.

For lot size you only have to set the one direction. I use buy-step-up .02, buy-step-down .01 if going long. sell-step-down .02, sell-step-up .01 if going short.

Its been a rather slow week for me. 0.74% gain but even less DD so I am ok with that. Close to my monthly 5% target so I will not push it.

Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
alternatively, instead of calculating the gridsize and the take profit, you can let the optimizer run and find optimal settings that way.

However, this may consume quite some time.

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
Ok, I am giving it a go. I started this week with real money on usdjpy only. So far it looks fine, will see how it goes. I am using piggy V 4.0

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
for the optimize in back test wich period? 1 month? 4 month? when you find the optimal setting for grid size sl tp how are you sure that's for tue future?

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
This is a excellent point. Back testing results can change even if you start the start/end dates by just a few days. The optimizer is very slow to run also. I think BT's at best, can give an idea about what pairs might be more stable over a longer period of time, but like you said the future is unknown. This is why I don not trade it as a pure mechanical grid.

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
thorn so as i saw also in other treads about grids they go to look the pairs that are in trend

and they go one direction only. the problem is that when the market changes the direction.

or another way is to go in range pairs but with very large grid size and wait the price to bounce

from one side to another but in this case it is very long to expect the result.

to me the immediate result you have with the trend pair. and  to close all the operations when

reach the target. the problem is how to find the pairs to trade. you have some good indicators

and can suggest one time frame to look for and to trade with this ea?

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
I use the EA as a tool. My trading is half EA and half manual. If you are looking for me to give you settings and pairs to trade I can not do that. I do not punch in settings and let the EA fly. I constantly monitor and adjust as the week goes on.

Yes I trade in one direction. Mostly go with the longer term trend direction, but I do sometimes trade a ranging pair if it looks to be bouncing off S/R levels.. Use no indicators. If you read my earlier posts, you can see the basic outline on how I trade this. Trends do change direction eventually but most times there are ranging periods before that happens. That is why I trade multiple pairs. As long as the pairs are not correlated, the odds of them all changing direction at once is slim. Since I close down my grids when I reach a certain equity target, I am not married to one certain pair. I adjust as I go along. This week has been very slow for me. Only trading 3 pairs, they been pretty flat all week. I made nice gain last week. It happens. Need patience when grid trading.

dear thorn,

Very thoughtful and considerate of you to share your style of trading. Hopefully you see many more green pips. I am doing a partial manual style where I close heavily lost trades, so that margin call is avoided. I have a real account and demo account running the EA. The big issue is when there is no retracement as it keeps opening contra trades in an algo fashion. GY is ripe for that kind of movement too. Lets see how this goes.

Thanks and cheers

Hello Programmers!

I've been struggling trying to use Fxdreema to compile my EA. I need to create pivot, support and resistance lines, based on a H4 candle that I'll specify by "Time". The EA would draw these pivot/S/R lines on the chart, and use these lines for trades. While trading, the EA would use these pivot lines for trigger, TP and SL values. This is what I've done so far https://fxdreema.com/shared/oYx2D4SF. The problem is that I think I did something wrong. I have defined the pivots and drawn the lines, but trades do not recognise the lines to use them as conditions for trading, TP and SL.

Kindly help!

Hello every one,

why not add trading stop and target profit ?? i think is very important to have with that kind of ea ....

regards

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
took long enough playing with this ea tonight to figure it out guess it does pretty good once you get the bugs out of it Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
That drawdown though!!!

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
Dear alpinepr

I can test with your figures but I never get your result. I really do not know whats wrong. but something is wrong.

Have you really tested on 4h roughly 2 months?

--- 帖子 #1227 ---
After Spread taken into account i get 0 profit and eventually it just goes to zero.

--- 帖子 #1228 ---
Just note that the time-frame is irrelevant in this strategy. It works on price gap (Round numbers) and this has nothing to do with the TF you attach the EA to.

There is something not correct in alpinepr image. In the settings there is no 0.1 lot size for sell trades but in the list of trades you can clearly see that the Sell trades were at 0.1 lot size.

alpinepr can you please attach the full results for the Back Test you have done for EURJPY.

Thanks...

Since January 1st 2017, all the the piggy in my demo accounts are no more taking any trades. Does anyone have ideas why they are not working again?

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
What version? Mine are working fine. Did you check live trading enabled?

--- 帖子 #1231 ---
Hi to all

I have a problem!

1 - I attached EA V4-2 from 7 hours ago since now , but dont any trade open yet . is it ok????

2 - My another problem is ,i can attached only v4-2 on my charts and v4 and v4-1 dont attached . Is these expired version?

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
version V4-1, i check the live trading. It was working ti December 31, 2016.

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
great EA, i will test it, thank you

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
expect horrible drawdown.... but if you survive, it could work.

Very difficult finding settings where risk/reward ratio is appealing, ie: there is only 1 risk; you blow your account.

I am trying to find settings that have high probability of at least doubling an account, so I can withdraw the initial deposit, and then take it from there.

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
Drawdown is not horrible if traded right. With grids there will always be drawdown, no way to avoid it.. If you are willing to accept 3-5% monthly,  DD can be kept to around 20% or less. Trading it as a pure mechanical, one pair,  set and forget grid will not work long term. I have a 6 month demo still running with this EA.  48.92% gain with a max DD of 22%. Average DD runs around 10% or less at any given time.

--- 帖子 #1236 ---
I am curious to which pair and which settings you use.

My gain is also about 50%, but my DD has been as high as 70%.

On average, I also have 10-15 % drawdown , but in 6 months I have encountered a much higher DD twice.

Overall I am happy with the results, but reading your postm things could be tweaked a bit better.

NB: I do trade in both directions, as opposed to your previous post. Drawdown did occur when the direction "bounces" of a support level.

--- 帖子 #1237 ---
Actually its "pairs". I never traded just one pair. Usually 3-4 at a time with reduced lot size (.01-.03) and I only trade one direction. Usually non correlated pairs although sometime I do trade correlated pairs but in opposite directions.  Mostly look for the longer term trend and trade in that direction.  Or for correlated pairs look for 2 that are ranging and trade one long/one short.Does it always work? No. I am under no illusion its perfect. I have been busy doing other stuff since the new year so I dont really monitor the demo much any more. Its been pretty much running pure mechanical. I will link the demo below and you can see the difference. Aug-Dec I was controlling EA and pairs traded. From Jan to present it was just going by itself with the same 4 pairs and no input from me. Me having control, the returns were much better. That is why I think a pure mechanical, set and forget grid is not that great. By monitoring it you can change lot size/grid space/TP and the pairs you want by reading what each pair is doing at the current time. I also would close the whole grid down when it reached a certain equity level. That way you could reset everything with a fresh grid. So if 1 or 2 pairs were not performing as expected, you were not locked into just waiting months for a retrace. More flexibility.

thx. I took the opportunity to also open a myfxbook.

Strange though, the balance is displayed incorrectly. The starting balance is way too high, which is somehow corrected in the end.

.

Maybe it will sort out itself after a while.

Anyways, thanks for the tips.

For AUD/NZD I could find nice settings as well, but the GBP/USD was more to my taste so I opted for that.

For USD/JPY I have not found settings that were withing my risk-appetite.

Basically, I backtested and optimized for various currencies, and find the best results with a drawdown of max 10k over a 5 year period.

I'll keep my pc counting the numbers for the CAD/CHF pair over the coming days

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
I'm glad people still trying and using this EA, it's one of the best I ever used, and it's free  I'm using this EA, but with some tweaks, just like thorn said, it's not possible to let this kind of EA run with "set and forget" so, we need to be able to analyze the pair range and have some notions about trends, supports and resistances.

Whenever a pair is at an extreme value, like for eur/usd when touched 1.0340(In my case I closed it at 1.04, cause I thought it would not go deeper) I closed the short side grid, and let only the buy side run.

Now you ask, what if the price broke the support. Well in that case I would have to risk and open the short side again. I know it's not a perfect solution, but it's working for me. It's a real account, I've doubled it in 4 months, withdraw half and let the rest run.

Good luck to everyone using this.

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
I think there are many ways to use this EA. You used your brain and used it as a tool that works for you. Too many are just looking for that get rich overnight EA and can't be bothered to do the work required to make any EA work. Good luck and continued success.

--- 帖子 #1241 ---
backltesting this ea with the same settings many are profitable

but mine always fails in the end, maybe its my platform?

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
Hello KeyDuck

I am very new to the EA and their use.

Can you please explain how to use the mq4 file? I tried it in the expert folder but it was not doing anything.

Would you please help.

Thanks

Mostafa

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
Hi Mostafa,

All mq4 files need to be compiled in order to use them in MT4. Just click on the mq4 file and the Meta Editor will appear. The Meta Editor will show you the title of the mq4 file and its coding. All you have to do is to press "Compile" or F7 and the Meta Editor will compile the file into a usable ex4 file. It is important to check if the file has been compiled properly by looking at the error log at the bottom of the Meta Editor. If errors are shown they need to be corrected in order to use the ex4 files. If there is no error but only warnings the ex4 will work but sometimes not exactly as intended. When the mq4 file has been compiled into an ex4 file all you have to do is to restart your MT4 platform in order to use the EA or indicator that you compiled. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
Hello Hutch

Thank you very much for the explanation. It is really useful.

However, I have one more question. How can I stop the EA at anytime I do not want to trade or at high risk news moments.

Thanks again

Mostafa

K guys, this will not work on small balances on all pairs... you're going to need to use a nano account (1 cent a pip) to run this on a live with small balances, Standard/ECN accounts 1:100 leverage not suitable, need 1:500 leverage, use one pair until you double the account.. its going to take a while.

I spent the last 5 months testing every variable there is --- and one thing to take from it all, is use a larger balance, $50K or higher, if you're able to obtain those funds, then in 12 months you'll be on the start of a journey as that of a Millionaire.

I have it on a live account and I've already configured it to make about 40% a month. On my demo, its made more than 125% so far of profit

--- 帖子 #1246 ---
Here's what my demo looks like.

Its been configured to make over 27% compounded each month.  And I have a live account with a little over $75K in it.

Thanks to whomever made this, nice work  I had a similar bot a LONG time ago, worked well for a while but it wasn't good enough for smaller balances. It required at least $20K to use.

I have deduced that there is no way to make money from this on 1:100 to 1:300 leverages. Higher leverages are needed to stay within the Margin Level Percentage (aim to stay above 500% margin at all times. and make it fit until you can place it on more pairs.)

To run this on 30 pairs, you'll need a minimum of $6,000 via a nano account (1 cent per pip), 1:500 leverage (or higher), 10% Margin Stop out level as the default 50% margin call level is for most brokers, but can be changed. The DD on this one will be quite high using lots of pairs. I would suggest to stay with the pairs that move the most each day, ie, GBP/NZD, GBP/CAD, GBP/CHF, EUR/NZD, etc, even some exotics will work out well too.

To remain safe, leave it on GBP/NZD pair and a $6k nano account could add approx 10% to your balance after 4 trading weeks. When your balance doubles, add another pair.. keep doing this for a while until you have most if not all of the larger fluctuating pairs.

Then if you're at the stage where all the faster and larger moving pairs are working nicely for you and your balance for example is $18,000 for a 200% ROI, add one more pair and wait for the $18K balance to double again to $36K when you're using pairs that dont move so much, cos you're going to be left in these for a while since some will have its volume exhausting, when it reaches $72K, move the money into a ECN 1:500 account on the same pairs, same settings... and watch it grow

Would anybody be kind enough to modify keydcuk EA below to have the option to input stop loss for individual trades/orders? Just so that one can have an emergency stop loss in place in case a trade goes in the wrong direction for several 100s pips and never retrace enough. Thank you.

Hello everyone,

Is anyone still using this EA? I noticed the last reply on this thread was on April 5, 2019. I've tried it on a demo account, and it's working perfectly. If anyone has learned something new or made modifications to this EA, please share your experience so others can benefit.

Thanks!
