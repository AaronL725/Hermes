The markets are said to be random walk. Through the years of trading I really believe that the markets are random walk with a drift (drift means the current trend). So in roulette sense random walk is black or red happening has a %50 chance (omitting the zero). Some of you will argue that the markets are not random. I totally respect that. But unfortunately the markets are very close to random walk. I devised a support and resistance indicator ( using abokwaik indicator, praise to him). You will see that the prices really respect these levels. Try these indicators out and you will see how important they are. Just use the RW-SupportResistanceALL on your charts (those indicators use ATR-Close to make the calculations). Please use this indicator on 5 minute chart in order for them to work correctly. After you attach them on the chart you have to draw Fibo retracement starting from "D1 Res 0" towards "D1 Sup 0". Attached is the chart image Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thats it for now. Edit: I have revised the indicator, so that only this indicator ( RW-SupportResistanceALL) will be used on the chart. It will use the ATR-Close indy in the background so both must be downloaded Attached File(s) ATR-Close.ex4 10 KB | 2,258 downloads Attached File(s) RW-SupportResistanceALL.ex4 17 KB | 2,321 downloads

On RW-SupportResistance indicator change the colors of weekly support and weekly resistance to NONE in the indicator color settings..

For trading try the following: If you believe that the market is short than enter sell limit at Fib 78.4 level, take profit at Fib 0 (D1 Sup 0). Stop Loss few pips above Fib 100 (D1 Res 0). If you believe that the market is long than enter buy limit at Fib 23.6 level and take profit at Fib 100 (D1 Res 0). Stop Loss few pips below Fib 0 ( D1 Sup 0). This is sort of a set and forget trading style. You will be surprised when you see the success rate... Good hunting and Good luck......

Thanks for sharing your winning strategy. I am following you and starting with 0.01 lot.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
can share more details about the tigger, which pair is suitable, which time for your system, thanks for share Gold, need your update, thanks --- sto - macd

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thank you and good luck..

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Well since it uses the random walk theory it can be used for any pair or cfds. Just make sure you put those two indicators on 5 minute charts..

--- 帖子 #8 ---
You are 100% right - I tested a lot of systems and spent a lot of money for indicators and magic software. Since few months I trade random and I use a smart trailer. I am profitable now. But most people don't believe that it is so easy.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
1. How do you arrive into believing that the market will be long/short ? 2. Do you mind to explain a little the levels algorithm ? 'Cos I cannot use MT4 ... If it's kind of a secret, I will understand ...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I am glad that it works for you. Thank you and good luck....

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I like your theory Unfortunately , I am on vacation but waiting to back and test it. Subscribe

--- 帖子 #12 ---
1. It is up to you. You can use moving average, or any other method to figure out the trend. 2. It is not a secret. Random walk calculates (Sqrt(bars) * Volatility * ZScore) You can find more detailed explanation on wikipedia or any other statistics based website. Thanks...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks Panisko.. Enjoy your vacation in the meantime....

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Do you use the 5 min trend ? Or 1h, Daily?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Since this is a 1 trade per day suggestion, better to use 1 hour and up to find the trend...

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thank you, I thought so.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Is it correct, that we must have a longer distance between the last reversal of the trend and the 23.6/78.4- Level, so that the trend can develop? Or is it acceptable, when the trend starts at the 0/100-Level for instance? Can you tell us your winrate?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
The Random Walk theory does not give any indication of a trend. It just gives the possible levels of turning points (support and resistance). The winning percentage depends on how successfully you can assess the trend for that specific day. A trader who is successful in evaluating the correct trend can even enter a trade at the opening of the new day and target "D1 Sup 0" for short target or "D1 Res 0" for a long target.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
So the levels refresh every day at 00:00? (daily levels)

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Exactly... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I have revised and combined the indicators into one indicator. Download both of them but attach only the RW-SupportResistanceALL on 5 minute chart, on the background it will use the ATR-Close indicator. Attached File(s) RW-SupportResistanceALL.ex4 17 KB | 1,112 downloads Attached File(s) ATR-Close.ex4 10 KB | 880 downloads I have edited the first post too....

--- 帖子 #22 ---
i like the approach How are those levels of sup res calculated?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks. Please check post 12 for the calculation logic...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
How u use ATR indicator

--- 帖子 #25 ---
It is used by the RW-SupportResistanceALL.ex4 indicator. ATR-Close is not used by itself. I have realized that you attached the RW-SupportResistanceALL.ex4 indicator on 1 Hr chart. It is supposed to be attached on 5 minute chart. Good Luck..

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Do you move your SL to BE, perhaps on 38/62 or 50%-Level?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Never. It is either a loss or a win. When you move your SL you are making the probability of price hitting your SL higher. So I personally never move my SL. You can consider moving your SL to BE when the price reaches 78 when long, 23 when short, for insurance. But I never do that.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #28 ---
GoldTheHun, Thanks for the food for thought... How were your results and for how long you have been trading this approach? One doubt though: When we have to define the trend either by MA or any other X method, isn't it in some sense introducing the subjectivity of the trader into the random walk behavior of the market. I mean, the drift is the current trend. So we can say the market switches between "Randomness" and Predictability{Drift/Current Trend}...Is the approach of defining a trend and saying the market is random antithetical? Thanks

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks for your comments aaven. Figuring out the trend is not a must really. If you know it, than it is much better of course. This random walk indicator calculates the possible levels that price could hit during the day. It calculates this using ZScores. For example if you enter short at level 78, and your target is hit (which is the zero level) your risk reward is approximately 1:3. So even you don't have a clue which way the day will go, there is a big chance the you will come out ahead in the long run. When the market switches to trend or drift mode it will go much lower than zero level, or much higher than the 100 level. This method uses only a smaller portion of the potential range of the day. So you rally don't need a huge drift/trend. I trade using few methods, so this is just one of them. This is a very low risk trading style. After you are accustomed to it, you can even use a sort of small martingale multiplier after every loss (small as 1.35 or 1.40 multiplier). Before you enter the trade the price will hint you that it doesn't want to go above 78 or below 23. When you feel this hesitation it is time to enter. One should never blindly enter everyday at these levels... You should always feel the market........ Hope this helps. Good Luck....

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I'm pretty sure that a profitable trade is depended on what happens after you buy or sell, not before.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Hi GTH. In your chart, on post #1, you added fibs only to cover the last 2hrs. How is this determined? The entire day had much higher boundaries. And I'm not understanding how the daily range on your chart, could be so small, compared to the visible daily range. In applying RW to M5 EU &amp; GU, today, I see nothing usable.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hello diamonddbw, The Fibs I have put are not time dependent. If you read the first post, the Fibs are supposed to be put starting from D1Res0 line towards D1Sup0 line. So as a result D1Res0 becomes Fib 100, D1Sup0 becomes Fib 0, and daily open becomes Fib 50. I hope this is clearer now. Good Luck.....

--- 帖子 #33 ---
This is pic of current UJ on M5. Is this set up properly? Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Yes diamonddbw, your setup is perfect....

--- 帖子 #35 ---
If your assessment of the market was short, than you could have taken no short trade for the day. If your assessment of the pair was long you would have taken the long trade which would have end up in a loss...

--- 帖子 #36 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Welcome Darryl, have a good one....

--- 帖子 #38 ---
How long it's average to close the trade?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Long trades exit at D1Res0, short trades exit at D1Sup0, if these levels are not hit, you can close at the end of the day or wait for the next day if the swap is in your favor..

--- 帖子 #40 ---
This broker changes time @ 2100 GMT, 1700 NY. I reloaded indicator so it would reset for new day. In a case like this, would I only be looking to sell @ 78%, or can I also buy @ 23%?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Yes that is the correct open for the day. You should only decide on one direction. Either sell at 78 or buy at 23, not both on the same day. It is a one shot deal. If you get stopped out, no more trading these levels for the day. Whether you decide to buy or sell wait for the price to hesitate on 78 or 23. If you think the move is stalling than enter. Watch it for a few days and you will start to get the feeling for it. Good luck... Note: If you subtract Fib 0 level price from the Fib 100 price, the difference would be hovering around the average daily range. But the indicator does not look at the daily ranges, random walk with volatility gives out this result..

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Earlier today, I drew this Supply zone on EurAud. If you put the fibs on today's (5 April) 78% &amp; 100% are the exact numbers I drew here. Confluence is always good.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I totally agree on the confluence part but I don't know how supply/demand is figured out. So I will leave that to you

--- 帖子 #44 ---
hmmm, I put on the ATR close then the RW on a 5 min chart and it draws the lines in the same place

--- 帖子 #45 ---
When I hold a trade overnight and D1Res0/D1Sup0 changes, is the TP of the previous day still valid?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi GoldTheHun, You said that the formula for random walk is Sqrt(bars) * Volatility * ZScore. I have two questions : 1. Volatility is the standard deviation of natural logarithmic daily return for some number of days ? If yes, which is that number of days ? 2. What means bars in sqrt(bars) ? And why this term is necessary ? It is for adapting somehow the daily volatility to the m5 chart ?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Have taken three trades this morning based on this method. All three of them are in the money!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Congrats Man. If you get a chance, shed some light on method {BB or Any Other} you are using your using to define a trend.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I have the same problem...can anyone help with this ?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Up to you. Either accept them as valid, or use the new D1Res0 and D1Sup0 if they look more adventageous.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Great start, congrats Cobra. But I will assure you not every trade is gonna be like this. So always be selective. One more thing, your Fibs are drawn the other way around. You should draw the Fibs in such a way that Fib100 matches D1Res0, Fib0 matches D1Sup0. Good luck and keep it up..

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Make sure you have at least 1500 of the 5 minute bars on chart.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
You should be able to see the direction of the trend when your 5 min is compressed. Otherwise check the hourly. Working on a 5 minute you cannot really go to a 4 hour as there are smaller trends within bigger trends. That will confuse you. I am merely checking this out and are by no means the expert. The bouncing off from fib levels within this method is interesting...... I am a trend trader and my focus is on the bigger picture!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thanks Cobra for your inputs...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
GoldTheHun, Much appreciated for taking the time to guide me with your inputs...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
hi GoldTheHun, thanks for sharing this system. I could not agree more with the statement "...You should always feel the market........" Im also a believer in ramdon walk, particularly for those 50-50% win ratio setups. But (and this is a big but), if you really feel de market, IMO, it doesnt matter anything else. Any system, method, strategy, pattern, etc fails and any of them works. I mean, when anyone feels the market then he/she has the edge on his/her side no matter what system, method, strategy, pattern is trading. The challenge to me is how to tame that feeling, not to mention to master it. There is where, I believe, the implicit concept of ramdon walk helps a lot. Thanks again for sharing and good trading!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You're welcome aaven. I hope they are beneficial to you.... Good luck....

--- 帖子 #59 ---
You're welcome Allthings... Actually these levels makes it easier to feel the market (at least for me). When I watch the price action, I pay close attention to which levels are holding.. That gives me a feeling of the daily intentions. This is not %100 of course, but still helps. Generally the price will not touch both the D1Res0 and D1Sup0 in the same day. That is an advantage for me for example. If price goes up to D1Res1, it very rarely returns and touches the D1Sup0.. When you watch the price action together with these levels you will see a lot of angles. Good luck in your trading...

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thank you for your reply GoldHun ... unfortunately that didn't solve the problem. Is it due to the fact that my broker has 5 digits after the comma in their data ?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi GoldTheHun, When you have time, is it possible to answer to post 47 ?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I have 5 digits with my broker too, but no problems.. Try this: First open the daily chart of the pair, thank go through every time frames (4hr, 1hr down to 1 minute) than return to 5 minutes and attach the indicator pls. See if this solves the problem. Also does it cause this problem on all the pairs or some pairs?? Please advise....

--- 帖子 #63 ---
GoldTheHun...my mistake...it's all good now...I didn't know that ATRclose was used and I had changed the name of that indicator...sorry about the inconvenience...looking forward to trying this. Cheers !

--- 帖子 #64 ---
No problem at all. Glad the problem is solved.... Happy hunting n good luck...

--- 帖子 #65 ---
That is why I said thanks I am working on several tasks at this moment, apart from my family duties. Not really spare brainpower these days for adding new golden stuff but I will follow the thread and start "feeling" your system (thanks again) most probably after Easter time. So please, let some pips available !!!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Gold, As I use a different platform and cannot look at the indicator in action, please would you set out the calculation for D1 Res 0 and D1 Sup 0 using previous day OHLC data and the ATR. What period daily ATR are you using? Thanks

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Sorry forexcentric, I have missed that post. Thanks for reminding. The method of calculation that I use is a very simple one actually. In a day we have 288 of 5 minute bars. In a week we have 1400 of 5 minute bars. So I calculate the absolute difference of closes of 5 minute bars to find volatility (no logarithms). For daily calculations the expected levels become Daily open +-volatility * Sqrt(288) * ZScore For weekly Sqrt(1400) is used.. Hope this helps.. Good luck...

--- 帖子 #69 ---
As I have explained in post 68, I don't use ATR, I use absolute close differences of 5 minute bars... Previous day OHLC has nothing to do with this method... Good luck....

--- 帖子 #70 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Get an MT4 demo from Tradersway. They have the proper broker time.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks for explaining. But one more question on this. What is ZScore?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thank you, Gold! One more question: you said "So I calculate the absolute difference of closes of 5 minute bars to find volatility (no logarithms).". So the daily volatility is the standard deviation of the 288 m5 bars from previous day ? I mean, you calculate a standard deviation after you calculate the absolute difference between m5 bars, right ?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Well for the explanation you have to search the web. It is a statistical term dealing with Normal Distribution. Would take so long to explain it. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Standard deviation would be the sqrt(288) * close differences. You multiply this value with relevant ZScores... The differences of 5 minute bars are calculated for a length of 1400 bars (1 week) not 1 day to get a smoother picture.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I found this: The algorithm to compute a Z-Score is simple. Start with a list of numbers representing common values for something. Compute the mean of this list. The mean is just a simple average. Then compute the standard deviation of the list of numbers. The standard deviation is the average distance between each number in the list, and the mean of the list. Now take a new number that you want to compare to the list of numbers. Subtract the mean of the list from that number, then divide the result by the standard deviation of the list. The final result will be the Z-Score of the new number compared to the list of numbers. The source: https://www.trade-ideas.com/glossary/z-score/ And a new question to Gold: Z-Score is a characteristic of a number compared with a list of numbers. OK, that list is those 288 m5 bars ( for daily ). But which is that number for which we compute the Z-Score ?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Signıficant ZScores are 1, 1.645, 1.96, 2.58 So the volatility is multiplied by these numbers in order to arrive at the levels.. You should look up ZScores in wikipedia. They have a deeper explanation with pic samples. Hope this helps.. Good Luck....

--- 帖子 #77 ---
A very nice simple system to follow. Thank you, GoldtheHun. Like the "set and forget", entered 2 entries today, one TP and one still hanging around the entry price. So if SL is 0.5%, 2 entry per day. Possible outcomes: worst case: 1% lost (eg. 2x SL) Best case: 3% gain (eg. 2x TP) Fantastic! Appreciate the contribution, GoldtheHun.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Dear GTH, Thank you very much for this unique trading approach which has brought up nice ideas and concepts. I made a mistake though and got a loss -- still learning. Got in again with profit now. Thanks once again. I would like also to ask if you could adjust this Indicator to work on larger TF's mainly because I really dont trade 5min TF and I believe some others here may have same concerns. Please help. Best Regards T

--- 帖子 #79 ---
With this, I think I got it all ... Thank you, GoldTheHun!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Glad to hear that it fits your trading style. Keep it up FireFries... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Great! Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Thank you for your positive comments. You really don't have to trade the 5 minute TF, these levels are just calculated on 5 minute TF thats all. You can use any time frame you like, as long as you know these levels. Also youcan use the weekly levels with the same logic if you like higher time frames. Hope this helps.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
hello GoldTheHun, please i have some questions i would like you t help me with answers 1) as shown in the attached chart, when price touches 23.6 on fibo i would go long with TP at D1 Res 0 and the opposite when price touched 78 on fibo...my fibo doesnt show 78% i want to know if you readjusted your fibo from the default? 2) How does one determine the SL does it go to the D1 res 0 for shorts and D1 Sup for longs? 3)what are the criteria to enter a trade when price hit 23% or 78% thanks for your time and sharing your system Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Here are the answers to your questions within my capabilities: 1. You double click the Fibo tool on chart, right click on it to see the Fibo properties and add 78 as a new level. 2. I couldn't understand the question, pls clarify.. 3. Depending how you determine the direction of the trend. There is no clear cut method, every trader has their own opinion of the direction of the trend. If you believe the potential is on the long side enter long, if you believe the potential is on the short side, enter short. Just one direction per day though, never chase the price. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Ohh Owkayy! Thanks man I thought that way because you said in one of your posts that the indi worked only on the 5min TF. Now I get it, you meant it only executes correctly on the 5min TF but the levels can be traded on any TF. Thanks a lot for your speedy responses to all posts. Just as a side note, why did you give it the name "The Unbeatable". Gets me really curious. Will be posting my trades from tomorrow (Thursday). Best Regards T

--- 帖子 #86 ---
No problem, you're welcome... The random walk is said to be unbeatable, in trading. Which means there is no way to find an edge or make money when the prices follow random walk. That is why I put "The unbeatable" in brackets because that is the alternative name for random walk. I didn't mean that the method is unbeatable.. Thanks for asking though. With your help we have clarified it Good luck...

--- 帖子 #87 ---
What i meant for question 2 was if i took a buy trade at fibo23% level, should my SL be at the D1 Sup 0 and a sell trade at 78% fibo level should my SL be at the D1 Res 0 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Yes, that is exactly right, but you should add few pips as a buffer. Long stops few pips below D1Sup0, short stops few pips above D1Res0.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #89 ---
GTH, thanks for this "tame the drunken sailor" approach. About your indicator: it seems to be very reluctant to refresh itself when changing the symbol (needs a change of timeframe to refresh), is this normal?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thanks for you positive comments. I love the "tame the drunken sailor".. Very creative... Unfortunately what you say is true for the time being. Every time you change the pair, it is better to refresh... Good luck..

--- 帖子 #91 ---
So, when we follow this method, we need a deep retraces of trends to do buy or sell. But good, strong trend never has deep retraces, and we will never get in it. And we will take only weak trend, which tends to get flat or even return. I see a big problem in that all.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
And I see one more big problem. It's highly risky to use limit orders by that method, cause we set theese orders frequently against 1H-trend, it's very dangerous. We need some warranty that our limit orders wil be activated by spykes, not by trend move.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi Rammstein, That is a very correct statement. If you suspect a big trend is happening you can always enter at 61.8 (38.2), or even at 50 (open). It depends on your view on the trend. I have set hard rules in the beginning for the new traders, for them not to jump in at every opportunity. If you suspect a big trend you can also extent the take profit levels.. Good Luck.....

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Very correct too. Thats why, in earlier posts I recommended to watch 5 minute charts and wait for the price action to hesitate on the entry level, get the feel of the market then enter.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Here is a trade I took today. By the way I only trade futures, with a futures broker. I also use MT4 for technical analysis and coding of indicators. We were only 40 minutes into the live trading session of emini sp500. The priceaction already hit the W1Sup0, with the daily range already 20 (generally hovers around 14.5). With still 4 hours to go in the session this upward thrust could not have gone on. So I shorted at W1Sup0. I have put the take profit at D1Res0 (which is Fib 100). As you see on the pic it worked perfectly. If the price would hesitate around D1Res0 I would have closed my position, but things went smooth. Of course it could have moved up and hit my SL, but thats part of trading. The reason I am showing this is that any combination could work as long you feel the market conditions at all time. I am a full time trader for about 7 years now. Through the years you learn a lot by just paying close attention to charts.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi Guys, I need some help here pls. I can't view the inicator lines/levels on the 5Min chart because they seem to be too wide apart to be captured with the frame. Except on the 30M, H1 charts and that's after fully zooming out. But I can see some post here with 5Min chart showing the levels and without fully zooming out. What am I to do pls. Thanks T

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Thank you for your explanation, GoldTheHun. As we see, "trading system" is much more than just "RW-SupportResistanceALL" on our chart. System needes rules, ok? But "as long you feel the market conditions at all time" - is not rule, this is your own method. So we can't use it in our trading :-) So, formally, there is no system in your thread. Just for truth :-). But, thank you for share with us your method and good luck to you too!

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thank you for the good wishes and honest view. Exactly like you said this is not a "system", this is a statistically proven tool. Just like any other tool. It is up to the trader to use it the way he or she likes to make use of it.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Can you post a chart please?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
And that is the beauty of high probability systems..... Few will find it useful and they will apply it to their advantage.... Some will use it and start tweaking it until they lose interest....... Some does not really make an effort to understand it and rejects it with his first post..... To some it is simply not a system...... Some others wants to be spoon fed and gets frustrated if things do not work out for them.... Most traders does not want to do "screen time" and will never have an understanding of how the markets work......

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I will have to agree with all your statements. What you are saying is so true and very unfortunate for those who don't want to understand...Chasing a dream or utopia that will never happen unless you work very hard at it.... Good Luck, my friend.....

--- 帖子 #102 ---
GoldTheHun, Thanks for taking the time to post the analysis for your trade... One follow up question i have is: My understanding is the Support and Resistance Lines offer a 24 HR trading window/opportunity. Within the 24 hour period, the market could show different faces of trend depending on the time frames.... 5Min*288 15Min*96 1HR*24 4HR*6 An uptrend on a 15 Min TF could be pullback on a hourly... Also,The more i see, a trend/drift would yield results if it was defined in terms of market structure, case in point: Your example: Using ADR and mapping it to the Support or resistance... I want to fix on a method of defining trend {which is the confusion part for me} and get onto the business of putting in the screen time... In this sense, could you advise on the framework? Thanks

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hello aaven, Welcome for the analysis of the trade. It was just a sample of one way the levels have to be used. I am sure you can probably find hundreds more... Since we are concentrating on the current day, finding the trend does not depend on time frame. We have to focus on today, that means looking at the daily time frame first. Does it show a short or a long stance? Take a look at last 20 or 30 days. Prices want to go down or up? When prices don't want to to certain direction the volatility drops towards that direction and picks up steam when going towards the opposite direction. These are just to name a few pointers. I am sure other traders might have better view of the trend. The levels are not ADR mapping at all. The are purely done on 5 minute closes volatility. They seem to hover around ADR, because the ADR consists of 288 of 5 minute bars. This means that random walk theory works. Honestly I do not have a solid method for a trend. Believe me I have checked and tested so many methods to define the trend, but unfortunately they all failed at one point or another. My best advise would be to watch watch watch (which is what I do). Also I look at the options data at CME website to see if there are huge open interests at one price. I hope this much helps. Please feel free to ask anything. Good luck...

--- 帖子 #104 ---
One more important point aaven. In my personal view trading forex is the hardest of all. The pairs are all interconnected to one another. If 1 moves, connected ones have to move. So you do analysis on 1 pair, but the movement of another pair totally screws this analysis up. I suggest everybody to trade cfds (non currency) or futures...Nothing else, not even spot gold. If you want to trade metals choose the cfds only.. Thats my 2 cents...

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thanks GoldTheHun for the great insight... It is much appreciated...

--- 帖子 #106 ---
You're always welcomed... Have a good one...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
GoldTheHun Could you please clarify: "Suggest everybody to trade cfds (non currency) or futures...Nothing else, not even spot gold. If you want to trade metals choose the cfds only" When you say trade cfds(non currency), is it equity like stocks/shares of company? What does trading Futures or CFD's offer in terms of advantage? Thanks

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I am talking about index cfds (not individual stocks). To name a few SP500 DAX NASDAQ DOW Metals (cfds only) FTSE CFDs:::::::::::::: You can follow the quotes on other sources on the web easily. Very hard to spike on purpose (like some brokers do). In forex there is no fractional lots on interbank markets, but all the retail brokers offer fractional lot sizing. Which means they are not hedging at all. They are all market makers meaning conflict of interest (you lose, they win). Cfds on the retail brokers are same also (they are market makers). But you can check the tick by tick prices through another source, hard for them to play with the prices. FUTURES::::::::::: Open market, totally transparent. You see the orderbook, quantity of buy and sell orders on each price level. Lower margin. Disadvantage only round lots trading 1, 2, 5 etc.. No fractions.. No hedging.. First in first out rule. When you lose money you know it is you, no other hand intervening... Just to name a few that I can recall... Hope it helps... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #109 ---
you are pretty close but haven't figured it out yet though with this prob system. ))) Good advice on the cfds via currencies though, or even plain equities much better option for long-term account survival.

Thank you for your input asgcorp... Good Luck....

--- 帖子 #111 ---
you can say that you figured markets out when you can pinpoint exact price levels and probability of price hitting this level one week ahead of time. seek and you shall find.

problem with traders nowadays that everyone just wants a get rich fast scheme and put least effort into it. Just buy weekly call options in Facebook stock and become a millionaire overnight. ))) Won't work like that. Anyway nice thread, just keep in mind if markets were random than you won't have guys like Jim Simmons @ Ren Tech managing closed 20 bln USD+ fund with 40% returns pretty much every year since inception in mid 80s. So yeah, markets are random, unless you can figure out certain patterns which are coded inside.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Great Inputs GoldTheHun... Really quick response... 1.So if we trade CFD's on currencies, we can rest assured the shenanigans by brokers are put in check? {I read somewhere that they have some sort of plugin or program that will spike price which will be visible only the terminal but there won't be any spike on the real price...something along the lines}... A real nugget of gold you have given. 2. " In forex there is no fractional lots on interbank markets, but all the retail brokers offer fractional lot sizing. Which means they are not hedging at all. " Is it a normal practice for brokers/entities that deal in InterBank markets to hedge their positions? Is the hedging done via some other instruments like gold/indices or derivatives or some other medium? Thanks

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Asgcorp, From what you said, it is a reasonable guess that you can pinpoint exact price levels ahead of time...I am not trying to pry your egde. Could you shed some light on what characteristic/behavior of market lends to its predictability? Random Example of characteristic/behavior : Liquidity, Some Hedge Fund/Entity needing to fill a X Lot Size and requires a week to do that and within a price range before commencing it's move etc.... Thanks

" problem with traders nowadays that everyone just wants a get rich fast scheme and put least effort into it. Just buy weekly call options in Facebook stock and become a millionaire overnight. ))) Won't work like that ." %100 correct... "Anyway nice thread" Thank you for the positive comment... " just keep in mind if markets were random than you won't have guys like Jim Simmons @ Ren Tech managing closed 20 bln USD+ fund with 40% returns pretty much every year since inception in mid 80s. So yeah, markets are random, unless you can figure out certain patterns which are coded inside." The markets are random %70 of the time, then they pick up towards the direction that they intend to go. Then they are no random at all.. So my personal view is that I can make money during the %70 of the time, and stay away the rest of the time. When the real trending starts it is very hard to know where it will end. In trading entry is the easiest part, exits are the hardest..This is my personal view of course... Thanks once again for your input.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #116 ---
aaven I don't have that edge over the market otherwise you won't see me posting around here I guess )) Still getting there. But part of the edge is seasonality and it's not FX only. Then again there would be only a few who can dig deep enough into this to actually be able to profit from this, it's not just buying Apple stock before new IP presentation in September. )))

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thanks a Lot GoldTheHun...

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thanks aaven... When I said hedging I meant they should pass your order to interbank in order to avoid risk and keep their spread difference as a profit( be a real broker). But unfortunately this does not happen with the retail brokers. They keep all of it. Thats why all those expert advisors that show profit during backtesting fail big time in real trading. Slippage, spikes, delayed quotes etc etc... There is no chance left for the retail forex trader to make money. Sooner or later you will fail. This is my view of course... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #119 ---
GoldTheHun yeah some valid points in there, taking profits in equities though is much easier compared to FX. Trends don't change that often but start of new periods, i.e. month/quarter is a good reference point cause funds will reshuffle their portfolios and you can spot valid entry and exit points before market will turn. Funds will trim exposure to stocks that did well in previous quarter/month and take profits. Same deal with AMD/NVDA stock right now, pretty much had an awesome run in 2016 both names up over 250% for the year, most likely topped out for this cycle and funds took profits but there are still desperate souls going all-in looking for another 250% run in 2017, that's called greed. Point is if a stock is up 250% last year chances are it won't be going anywhere this year.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
asgcorp, Thanks for your input, bu unfortunately I do not follow individual stocks or options. I only follow the indices and trade futures only. It looks like you are knowledgeable in stocks area (obviously more then me) you should stick with it. I believe every trader should trade what they know.. With endless capital out there, scraping the bones is more than enough for a retail trader... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #121 ---
yeah index options are much better they carry less risk. But with a bit of study it's easy to see why you would also trade some individual names, such as AAPL. ))) see below. this is normal dist of weekly returns past 20 weeks.

GTH please find attached these charts for USDJPY: The H4 view and the M5 view. What can I do? Notice that I cant see the Support Levels at all on the M5 same as M15 to H1 but on H4 and D1 I see only the first support level. Thanks for your concern.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Just bring the mouse to the far right side where the prices are, click and hold the left mouse button down, and drag the mouse down while holding. This will change the view...

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Check this out EDIT: Wao I got it now never known that was possible. I just put the mouse on the vertical scale and dragged down like you said. Thanks soo . Hey have you noticed the weekly RESISTANCE levels are labelled as SUPPORT?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Day 2 of testing this method. Place 3 limit orders. One to TP and one did not reach Entry but hit Target (Out) and last still waiting 0.5% risk 1.5% gain

--- 帖子 #126 ---
That was a typo error. Thank you for starting such a thread, I appreciate your efforts. As for the weekly labels, and since you have a special version of the indicator, you can modify the last line to reflect correct weekly labels, just change "W1 Sup " to "W1 Res ": //-- Weekly Resistance --------------------------------------------- obj1=prefix+"WR_"+i; ObjectCreate(0,obj1,OBJ_HLINE,0,Time[0],wr[i]); ObjectSetString(0,obj1,OBJPROP_TOOLTIP,"Weekly Resistance "+i); ObjectSetInteger(0,obj1,OBJPROP_COLOR,RweekColor); ObjectSetInteger(0,obj1,OBJPROP_WIDTH,weekWidth); TextCreate(0,obj1+"_L",0,Time[ChartGetInteger(0,CHART_VISIBLE_BARS)-1],wr[i]," W1 Sup "+i,"Arial",10,RweekColor); Best Regards, Khalil

GoldTheHun, How do you handle news?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Even during the news these levels are respected. But if you are in profit and news time comes you can liquidate your position. Even the spikes usually will end at these levels. You have to watch and see for for yourself for few days.. Good Luck....

Many thanks for all

--- 帖子 #134 ---
What you have posted is a perfect example. Price hesitates and hesitates on the 23 level.... You feel that it resists to go down anymore and you enter. I couldn't have presented a better example.. Thanks once again kfarawi... Good Luck...

thank YOU !!! I'm still demo trading though.

No problem in demo trading. Until one gets proficient in a method, they should demo trade a long time first.. Congrats...

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Guys great system. , i think we should start putting pending order screen shot so other can take benefit

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks for your input imran, Pending order might not be such a good idea. Before entering a trade one should see that the 23 or the 78 level is holding up. If you have a lot of speed on the price shooting up, it is better to wait and see how it is going to behave. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi GoldtheHun How is it possible that I have different values for D1 sup0 and D1 res0? I was checking the example posted by kfarawy when I realised that no price was around 23% today in (my) GBPJPY today. I followed the rules for installing the indi, and read all posts but.... By, the way I did not modify anything apart from colors in W1 as you recommended in one of the first posts. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Same when verifying Firefries EURJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any suggestion please? Thx in advance

--- 帖子 #140 ---
profit hit to the pip...unbelievable...there's something really valuable in this strategy...will do 20 trades and see the results...it's all about stats right ? anyway...thank you The Hun for sharing.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
kfarawi, I am glad and thank you sharing your result. As you know this is not an automatic method. The trader must follow how the price action is behaving around those lines. As I have mentioned before, once one gets a hang of it, he or she can devise so many entry techniques unique to themselves. Good Luck once again....

When random walk of price is more possible in quiet market condition or volatility market condition? If price is stayed or stucked above D1 Resp 0 or D1 Resp 1, like spx for today, does it mean random walk end? A directional bias of price move is unfold in future bars? or the rest of day?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Random walk never ends. As you see in the spx today, the price action respects the levels very much. I personally shorted spx at 2358. I believe there is enough time for the price to touch D1Res0. We will see.. Potentially with the time left there is a small chance that it can go down to 2350, if it doesn't make a new high. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Well D1Res0 happened, with a fast drop.. Now the prices is respecting and hovering around D1Res0. While I was writing it broke the D1Res0 down... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #148 ---
FIB indicator that will help!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Yes. you are right. SPX random walk down to W1 Sup1 level as US start a war in syrania. Is Trump going to seize all oil rig in middle East? Today, nfp data, US war, Trump-Xi summit, etc. Let see if market is still in random walk under heavy volatile news driving.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Which timezone do you use for the settings Gold? Cause different timezones mean different refreshing time and different Levels........

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Which UK broker do you recommend? I notice that my demo brokers all have different S/R levels for the same currency pair. It is frustrating to see that , as the accuracy of the levels is most important for the system to have consistency.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Cobra, Ive got the same trouble. 3 different brokers, 3 different levels. Maybe it is the true nature of randomness more seriously, this "method" is quite attractive to me but such a disparity in levels changes all fibs from broker to broker. Difficult to trust which one is the "guiding light". Hope we can find the way. nice day and green trading!

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I'm reading seriously from post#1 until you....brabrabra... 3 different brokers, 3 different levels. true nature of randomness

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi mattkirby, When first new tick start coming on weekly open that is your open for the day. For example first weekly start of USA would be at 17:00 est. It would be 00:00 for Athens. So weekly open is is the real open, doesn't matter where you live. So the same hour of the weekly open would be your open each day.... Good Luck

--- 帖子 #155 ---
The levels can not change from broker to broker as long as you have at least 1500 of 5 minute bars. Some brokers set a different time as open prices, so this would be the only reason of discrepancy... Good luck...

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Thx for replying. How do i make sure i have at least 1500 bars on my 5 min? Which broker do you recommend for the correct "opening" price? G

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Cobra I can't recommend any brokers, sorry. For the number of bars, just hover your mouse on the chart title at the bottom of the chart... I marked them with red...

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thanks für the Reply. I got this. But what I wanted to say is that the daily Levels are different in reference which timezone your Broker is. So when you have 3 Broker in different timezones you have 3 different daily Levels........ question is which one is the best???

--- 帖子 #159 ---
That is what I tried to explain. When you start receiving first quotes for the new week that is the correct time for the open. The indicator doesn't check for the time, it just checks the open price of the day from Daily time frame. But if some brokers are are playing with that I wouldn't know. The markets are opened the minute first quotes are received on Sunday (or Monday) depending on where you live. It is also the beginning of Australian session. So check your broker. If it doesn't fit this criteria than move on... Hope this helps..

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi goldthehun nice indicator - is there any chance you can add push/email notifications when a level is touched? Best wishes RT

Hi RogueTreder, I am not the original coder of this indicator. I have just modded it to fit the random walk theory. The coder of the original indicator is abokwaik . Who is an excellent coder and a member of FF.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Day 3 trying out this method... uneventful, likely due to NFP in an hour. So far, only entered one trade, exit with a small profit as Mkt not moving much and not risking with NFP. calling it a day (end of the week).

--- 帖子 #163 ---
FireFries, Thank you for updating your situation. Next week you will have many possibilities I am sure.. Good Luck and a great weekend....

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Thanks, GTH, it was a good 3.8% gain for the last 3 days. You have a great weekend too, bro.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Here is a brief explanation of how the levels are calculated: Using the absolute value of close differences of past 5 minute bars we find the volatility. We know from statistical rules that Sqrt(time) * volatility = standard deviation Since we have 288 of 5 minute bars per day, we calculate the statistical boundaries of the day (the levels). Sqrt(288) * Volatility * 1.00 Sqrt(288) * Volatility * 1.645 Sqrt(288) * Volatility * 1.96 Sqrt(288) * Volatility * 2.576 We add and subtract these calculated values from the daily open.. The last multipliers are the Z-Scores of normal distribution. So this is it. Very simple and effective way to find the possible daily support and resistance points (the significant level). Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Do you use 5 minute bars to calculate weekly resist/support level? How many 5 minutes bars is used? I found only 2324 bars for 5 minutes for spx 500 in my mt4.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi Jack, You need 1440 (5 min bars) for correct calculation.. So what you have is more than enough... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #168 ---
By the way, all upward pushes seem fake to me (my personal opinion). They don't want the price to go down prematurely, so they try to push it up for a while then let it go. I believe 23.6 level is very possible, if not lower. We will wait and see. Trading is a game of deceiving. The big money has to convince traders so that they can have enough number of traders to dump the lots..So if you honestly think that there is no reason for the spx to go up (or down), you should always stick with your initial thought until proven wrong... Happy hunting...

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Well after a lot struggle 23.6 hit finally... Good Luck all.....

--- 帖子 #170 ---
SPX got into tough correction, now. If 50 day ma is closed down, then, it will run 100 day ma. But, Wed Sell bar couldn't push spx down. If bar close above 2363 level, bull may run top side.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Very elegant logic being applied here GTH. Loving your thread

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hello GoldTheHun, Just want to run an idea by you for defining a trend: On Day 1 we let the indicator calculate the S/R lines and we note down the values. On Day 2, new S/R lines will be calculated. If the new S/R lines{block of lines} are below the Day 1's S/R, we say the trend is down for the Day and we wait for a pullback till 78 Fib and looking for stalling and take short... Haven't tested it though... Please give your take on this and be brutally honest if needed.... Thanks

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Welcome to the thread Copernicus.. I am very glad you enjoy it. Good luck....

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi aaven, Your idea will only show that today's open is lower than yesterday open and, unless the volatility is through the roof... Of course this could be a method too, but I personally don't like set rules for the trend. Rules work today and stop working the next day.. Personally for me only viable method is watching the price action around the levels. That gives me a hint on which way to enter. But that is just me... Good luck...

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thanks GoldTheHun for your insight. It is much appreciated. So keeping the focus on price action at those levels is the key...

You're always welcomed aaven...

It looks perfect but only problem is it is using the ATR. The one I have uses the following indicator. Attached File(s) ATR-Close.mq4 4 KB | 486 downloads If you could use this instead of the ordinary ATR, it will be perfect.

Hi, Attached is the "channel" indicator that draws only the relevant lines (daily open + buy and sell levels + SL levels) according to the described strategy instead of all the pivots. Attached File(s) channel_goldthehun_v2.mq4 2 KB | 557 downloads Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Many thanks for your work. Could you add TP?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi Gold, I'm getting closer, thanks for explanation. Last question: in your calculation sqrt(288) * Volatility * zScores.................with Volatility you mean ATR(288)Close.........so correct calculation is Daily open +(-) (sqrt(288) * ATR(288)Close *ZScores) ?!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
As far as i understand the strategy, the tp is is also drawn by the indicator. So buy/sell levels are default in thick dodger blue/tomato line. Tp for buy is the thin tomato line, sl for buy is "a few pips below" thin dodger blue line. Tp for sell is the thin dodger blue line, sl for sell is "a few pips above" the thin tomato line. k

--- 帖子 #190 ---
.....or just simple Dailyopen +(-) STD(288)Close * Zscores........

--- 帖子 #191 ---
OK. Thank you. I thought your SL-Line is already a few pips below/above the 0/100%-Level.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
If you download kprsa's code at post 181 you will see the volatility calculation. It is not ATR.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Long on the DAX...

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thanks once again kprsa for the time and effort.. Word of warning though: This is not an automatic system, where you buy at certain level and exit at certain level. Individual judgement must be involved. I personally use almost any level to trade depending on the day. So I recommend people to watch and devise their own method using the levels. In time you will see that these levels are very solid... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #195 ---
kprsa, If you enter at 78 or 23 levels normally TP levels are 0 or the 100 levels (D1Res0 or D1Sup0).. But if you enter at 50 level, your TP should be D1Sup1 or D1Res1. As you see these levels could be used in a very flexible way. Even a grid system could be devised... Just depends on the trader's creativity.. In time everybody will realize that daily high and low (or the intraday turning points) will always be at these levels... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Please look at the kprsa's excellent indicator ( pivot_goldthehun_v2.mq4 ) on daily time frame. You will need the ATR-Close.mq4 indicator in the indicator folder for the kprsa's indicator to work properly.. In following 2 charts you will find EURUSD and SP500 cfd, both in daily time frame. Please keep in mind that these levels are drawn as soon as the day is opened. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just analyze the daily highs and daily lows.. You will see the importance of these levels. Since these charts are daily time frame we can not see the intraday workings of the levels... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #197 ---
but with the calculation with kprsa's Pivot indi I get other S/R lines/numbers like with your original one (pic 1 &amp; 2) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #198 ---
GoldTheHun can You upload or say what is this indicator (like steps)?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi matt, I think the discrepancy comes from the zscores used. Mine uses 1, 1.28, 1.645, 1.96, 2.58. kprsa's doesn't have the zscore 1.28. That is why you are missing a level.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi Panisko, That is a MTF moving average of 5 minute time frame using EMA37 close, highs and lows. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Looks like there is an additional different Zscore number (1.28?) in the original indicator to me. I used the values (1, 1.645, 1.96, 2.576) from the post #165 . Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hello GTH, I find your approach very interesting, many thanks. I have afterwards 3Positionen open-to the testing. Now patience, let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Exactly kprsa.. That is my bad.. I just missed putting the value 1.28 in the explanations.. Sorry for that.. Since you wrote I have a question: On daily time frame, the calculation of the volatility for the past can not be correct I think. I am not a coder but the following line should not be sufficient to calculate the past.. double atr=iCustom(Symbol(),PERIOD_M5,"ATR-Close",1440,0,i); //iATR(Symbol(),PERIOD_M5,1440,i); It would be correct for the 5 minute time frame though.. Please advise.. Thanks...

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Can You look on your chart on UJ? Now on 23,6 will be good entry for long ?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I generally don't trade pairs. But to me UJ is heading south, so if the daily time frame is heading south too, I would wait for a retracement towards 50 then enter short, targeting 0 (Sup0),.. But this is my view... Good Luck..

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Yes, you're right. The indicator is written for the TF=5 min only. It would be slightly more complicated if one wanted to use it in other TFs (so MTF type indicator). Specifically the problem is here: Inserted Code double atr=iCustom(Symbol(),PERIOD_M5,"ATR-Close",1440,0,i); The iterator i is TF-dependent. I'll see how to try to sort this out. Note also that to use this on daily TF one will need to have many candles in the M5 graph... Best, k

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi kprsa, Thank you for your input. I totally agree that it would be complicated task and correct calculation needs huge amounts of 5 minute bars. I think it is better to leave it like this without further complicating it for you. I truly appreciate your inputs. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Is there any reason you can think of that this couldn't work on a Mean Renko charts (which are offline charts) - i know you said use on a 5m chart, just wondering if thats because of the technical makeup of the indicator or some other reason. I will test anyway but thought i would ask the question

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I use it on offline range bars and it works fine, but you have keep an open 5 minute chart of the same pair in mt4. Otherwise calculation might get wrong.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Thanks for the speedy reply, its appreciated. Looking forward to seeing how it pans out Thanks again

--- 帖子 #211 ---
hey GoldTheHun, can you please show a couple charts of your system on range bars, it could be interesting for some of us. Thanks

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Sure metta, Since I only trade sp500 for a long time now, here is pic of my chart. Range bars are 0.50 in height. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Red and blue bars come from 3 line break indicator and the 3 orange lines are mtf ma, set at 5 minute timeframe and they are ema37 of close, high and low. And this is it. I don't believe in crowded charts. So this gives me what I want.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Few pointers for people who are interested. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see the price respects these levels very much. I would like to see the price hesitate on a level before I enter. When weekly and daily levels coincide, they make a good support/resistance. Always watch for those. If I believe that the trend is down I will enter on any level, after a retracement towards the opposite side but price must show a hesitation on a level before you enter. On the long side if price bounces of D1Sup0, I can target 78, if bounces from 23 I can target D1Res0. I always expect a symmetry in prices for the day. If the low of the day is D1Sup0 for example, I only expect the price maximum towards 61.8 on fibo.. So always target the symmetry of the lowest of the day or highest of the day.. It is all probabilities. Just make sure that there is enough time left until the day and so that you target has a chance to hit. Hope this helps.. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #214 ---
spx hit daily support 4, or 99% volatility range, a huge skew to downside volatility extreme. Market seem like to do extremely run. "Skew" is a killer for math theory and runners. Dow hit 50% level, then, drop. spx hit 38% level, then, drop. I got a "feeling" that calculation of weekly resistance/support may got error? Fx often overshot on volatility, due to fx is running on spike, overshot to clear out stop loss for them to make $.

Hi Jack, There is no error in weekly levels. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you said spx hit the %99 level on the daily range but touched only the first level of the week, which is normal in huge spikes. But if you see the %99 level hold nicely and than shot up D1Sup0, now it seems like it might come down. Hitting the weekly first level on tuesday means the index was oversold pretty much. Let's see what happens next... As for the "skew" you mention, I don't think this is a skew at all. It is still running in normal distribution bounds. If it would go way below the %99 level than it could have been called a skew. But not this.. Good Luck.. PS: By the way you have some good long entries.. Congrats...

Hi GoldTheHun, Thanks again for your trading strategy. I am so surprised actually..... Do you think it's reasonable to use weekly support/resistance line with Fibb for H4 time frame? Thank you.

Hi JKLee, Since these levels are time independent you can use them for any time frame you like as long as you make sure that the calculation chart is 5 minute time frame.. Good Luck..

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi Matt, Highest significant z score is 2.58, which covers %99 of the data..If you need more coverage than you should search the web for a z score table... Goof Luck...

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi imran, Such a huge compliment, thank you very much

--- 帖子 #223 ---
after 2.576 Zscore, 99% confidence; next Zscore is 2.807, 99.5%; 3.091, 99.8%; 3.291, 99.9% But, market is evail with "Skew". Small probability event often run out to kill/clear market. If bet on 2.807, 3.091, 3.291 event occur, then random walk happen again?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Any conclusion of yesterday trades ? thanks SB

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Jack z score of 2.576 is %99...The nex ones are insignificant because that will happen 3-4 times a year, so it is nothing to worry about. Random walk has nothing to do with z scores. Z Scores are just used to find the boundaries of the random walk. You should search for an article explaining the random walk in detail. Good Luck...

Thanks, just want to play around a little with these numbers.......

GoldTheHun, respect for sharing your system to the wide public. I just want to put a remark about the randomness you are referring to in your first post. The buys and the sells are always trying to level out their balance. This is clearly visible when one is looking and the buy/sell candles on H1, for example. Maybe this is from where the randomness idea comes from? The reality is quite different, however. In longer term, there is a sell moment, followed by a buy one, who is almost equal (identical) in continuity (time) and in pips (not always the same, might be 1/2 or 1 1/2 in pips wise) with the previous sell moment. This is valid for almost all time frames. Here are two examples on GBPUSD on H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image EDIT: That has definitely nothing to do with market or rates being random. Right now I am trying to count and catch the moment of direction switch, when they level the balance out. So far, I am only trying

I heard that volatility and volatility cycle can be forecast. So, these volatility extreme levels will be good turning point after volatility is exhausted in its cycle.

Today, usd-jpy has hit Weekly Support 2 level. Can weekly sup 0 level become a good resistance level?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi MZ, Thanks for your input. The more higher time frames you trade, the less effect you will see from randomness.. But obviously higher time frames consist of of lower time frames which are random %70 to %80 of the time. The only time it breaks randomness is when the big capital decides to move the prices higher or lower to a certain target. This is called the trend (or drift in random walk theory). Since we never know what the real intentions of the big money, we try to sense their intentions or read their minds. I believe this is called the technical analysis. That is why technical analysis is a %50-%50 guessing game (guessing what the big capital wants to do). Unfortunately that is why we are late most of the times.. Big money has to deceive the rest of the traders so that they can make their money. If everybody buys or sells there is no money to be made because there are no losers.. So deception is the name of the game. They make you think the prices going up, make people excited so they buy thinking that they are missing on the action, than booom the big money sells and the late comers are left in the dust.. Since this is the game, we should adapt accordingly. Always question the reason for a strong move. Is it a valid move? Are there reasons for this move? etc... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Jack, Most of the times support becomes resistance and vice versa. One has to pay attention though. If support becomes a resistance and holds that means market is weakening. If resistance becomes support, market is strengthening... Good Luck

Some basic rules for the current day trend (direction to trade using levels): New High of the day is made: As long as price doesn't make a new low, trade long using bounces from levels (retracements). Make sure you have enough room and time left to reach your TP. New Low of the day is made: As long as price doesn't make a new high, trade short using bounces from levels (retracements). Make sure you have enough room and time left to reach your TP. My 2 cents... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi JKLee, I honestly don't recommend entering trades blindly, without considering the bias for the day and watching the price action. But of course it is your money and decision. I have to emphasize that this is not a trading system, it is just a road map or a guide, showing the potentials. How one use these levels depends on his/her creativity. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hi kprsa, Since you are talented coder, I would like to ask you the following question: Is it possible for you to change the code so that we take the volatility figure from the "ATR-Close" indicator from each day's open time and use that figure fixed for that day? In other words, we take the volatility figure at the time of the open of the day, let's say at 00:00 hours (if the daily open is at 00:00 hour), and use that for that day. This way we can see the past days levels more or less correctly (not %100 of course). I don't know if I could make myself clear.. Please advise.. Thanks..

Glad to hear that JKLee and thanks for sharing your charts.. But I will repeat the warning again (might sound boring ). Please never trade your hard earned money blindly. If you are selective and watch the price action before entering, I assure you that you will end up in green.... On the third chart, try to guaranty some profit, just in case... All 3 trades look magnificent by the way... Good Luck....

Hi GoldTheHunt. I have made my first test base on your system. Entry taken for EURCAD. I have checked the trend bias at TF H1 &amp; H4 and shows a clear down trend. The price position starts at fib retracement level and I decided to make a breakout entry at this level due to higher TF bias (chart shown below). I didn't wait price to go up to D1 Res[0] in this case. Setup: Entry : Break at Lower Fib Retracement Level. SL : 30pips TP : 2 pips above D1 Sup[0] Monitoring comment : Set and Forget. I hope this approach didn't against your trading rules. Pls correct me if I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
The pivot indicator for TF=5 min does exactly that. Are you referring to the calculation for other TFs? k

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi rolan, Thank you for sharing your trade. It looks like very good entry. Your trend assessment was perfect.. But my personal taste would be to enter at the first red bar. But you made a profit, that is a success.. Congrats. There is no clear cut rules here, as long as you don't enter short below or at 23 and enter long above or at 78. The market could be matured for the day at those levels, and you wouldn't have enough room left for your profit target. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi kprsa, Yes exactly, I am talking about the calculation of other levels for the daily time frame only, so we can see the past on daily bars. Thanks for your prompt reply.. Please advise.. Good luck...

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I think I see what you mean: identify the first TF=5 min candle of the day for current bar (regardless of its TF) and calculate levels. I should be able to do that. k

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thank you for your comment GoldTheHunt. I got your point now. Thanks again.

Exactly kprsa... I couldn't explain it very clearly but you got it... Thank you... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #245 ---
You're always welcomed roland. The reason I don't look for a breakout is that, the moment you realize it is a breakout you are late, and your SL has to widen, and it could also be a fakeout.. So I prefer to anticipate the price before it happens using the levels and trying to sense small weaknesses.. If I am wrong I lose little, but if I am right, I gain much more than my risk... Everybody has a way of trading which makes them to stay in their comfort zone.. This is mine... Good Luck and thanks for sharing your charts...

Hi FF, You're always welcomed and thank you for your input and stats... I don't recommend the levels to be used as a mechanical manner, like enter short at 78, exit at 0. I know I started the thread recommending this but it was just one way of using it. I really wish people start devising new methods of using them. Since kprsa made the daily indicator showing past days levels, I will do some kind of stats to see the the number of ways the levels can be used. Thanks for sharing your stats. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #252 ---
The levels seem spot on to me. I understand that the motivation for this method goes from random walk and is intended for intraday trading. However, one way of using this would be when some indicator on daily TF - for example nonlagdot, TDI, Ichimoku, Heiken Ashi... - shows a trend change. Then one makes the according entry and remains in trade as long as the trend is confirmed by the indicator on the daily scale. (This automatically takes care of the cut losses short/let profits run principle. The entry method also allows for compounding, which is useful.) Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thanks for your idea k, I totally agree with what what you are saying. There are so many ways to use these levels but the combos should have to be spewed out by a computer.. Honestly my mind is going crazy just thinking of the ways to use these... I think we are just scratching the surface here... Thanks once again and Good Luck as always...

Yesterday, Monday, it seem most of pairs did breakout 78%/23%. levels. SPX ran a outside day. Outside day, this method seem not work. Trending works. Today, usd-jpy stop at 78% and drop to 23% now, seem work. Today, gbp-usd is wild, but, good swing in neutral, then, breakout, hit 95% top side, 23% bottom side. cable, euro turn into bullish running now on daily, H4 view. Today, spx was short down by European/London open to Daily support 2 -- 80%. So, yesterday's bull may come in again as US open is coming.

gbp-usd got extremely volatile running, 200 plus pips up, lot of stop-loss were killed. Now, it is at 99.9% crit level. can it go up farther? US traders' order are in lower end, so, dealers or market makers may drop pound to seek orders?

Dow seem having a leading role over spx yesterday. Dow was completely bearish yesterday. But, spx rose much higher or more bullish, yesterday. So, yesterday, Dow is ok, Spx is not ok. I show both cases. Today, what is future price for Dow and Spx before US open, and after UP open? Can we forecast or spot a turning point in these zones for Dow, Spx? Or we have to wait till US open and big candles unfold? Or news come out? Can price repeat itself in future time series with random walk with its boundary randomness or its boundary limit ? Does Random walk theory mean price has less chance to repeat its old trace? or other meaning?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi Jack, Dow and SPX see to move that way sometimes, but at some point they converge (meet each other at some level). As far as the forecasting goes, these levels don't forecast the direction, but potential turning points. It should be the trader's mind doing the forecast for the direction. Random walk theory gives no guaranties about repetitions. So as far as these levels are concerned, if you followed many days, D1Res0 and D1Sup0 play a very crucial role. If they are hit early in the day, prices should reverse. If they are hit later in the day (where there is not much time left), it is not smart to expect a reverse.. Good Luck....

Hello GoldTheHun, Thank you for your thread and the concepts you have presented. I am trying to understand how your indicator RW-SupportResistanceALL works...... I have been observing it over the past few weeks and have noticed that the distance between DS_0 and DR_0 on the EURUSD is always 85 pips. Shouldn't that value change every so often based on the fluctuating ATR? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi drakos, The indicator is using Close[1] - Close[2] of 5 minute bars, so it is not based on ATR. The gap between the DS_0 and DR_0 should fluctuate, but since the volatility of the recent days are quite dead, the fluctuation is not noticeable for now. If volatility picks up in the future that gap will also change. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Today, spx on 5 minute chart, a lot of gap between candles, do these gaps affect calculation of volatility, c(1) - c(2), ? do gap often occur on chart in future spx ?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Jack, The gaps effect the calculation of volatility, but not in a wrongful way. During low volatility times (just like today) and before the cash markets open, spx might have a lot of small gaps, which is a very normal behavior.. Good Luck..

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hello Gold. Thanks for sharing such a great tool. Was wondering if any calculations made using open price(daily open and/or weekly open) could alternatively be done using closing prices instead?(i.e previous day close/previous week close) in calculating the levels. This could help to cancel any distortion introduced on gap days/weeks? I don't know if this suggestion makes sense???

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hello LITE, Thanks for you comments and idea. I have tried previous DAY/WEEK close, but it does not work as good. Random walk must start from the Daily/Weekly open in order to work properly. Hope this helps.. Good Luck.....

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thank you for the quick reply. I am impressed by your thoroughness in testing different ideas. I have incorporated these levels into my scalping strategy as a whole and i must say the results have improved trmendously. I will keep testing though and see how it holds up in the long run. trade safe.

Hi Gold, Love your work. The levels line up very well. Was wondering whether there is any way of modifying the "start of the day" in the code so that it starts at a more convenient time for me.

Hi GoldTheHun, This is a nice thread. I followed you when I read something about z-scores, and you were discussing it for first time with the master coder Abo.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Seems to me the indicator doesn't adjust the lenght of the levels based on atr, I mean every day the lenght between the first blue and red line stays the same, to the level that if I drag the fibo tool that I drawed the day before on the new day levels it fits perfectly.

Forgive me but i also don't understand how RW-SupportResistanceALL.ex4 calculates especially the volatility part. By "Close[1] - Close[2] of 5 minute bars" do you mean the average of differences of last 1440 bars? ie (Close[1] - Close[2] + Close[2] - Close[3] + Close[3] - Close[4] +....+ Close[1439] - Close[1440])/1440. if you could be kind and share the source (RW-SupportResistanceALL.mq4) or show us the line of code that calculates volatility. i will be grateful for this

--- 帖子 #310 ---
No problem Sidric, Here is the part of the code that calculates what you are asking for: MathAbs(Close[i]-Close[i+1]); Just like you said I calculate 1440 bars of 5 minute timeframe and then take the average. (1 week rolling average basically) Hope this helps... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thanks, it's all clear now. from what i have observed this is how i intend to use it: wait for the break out of 78.4 and 23.6 levels and enter, take profit is 3/4 of average daily range (14 days)... no need to be greedy. i have so far taken 9 trades today following this simple rule, 5 have TP hit, 4 are still running but 3 of those are in green. i don't intend to open any order as long as price is within 78 and 23 fib levels.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Welcome Sidric and thanks for sharing your method. Here is another angle you can use with your method in which you don't even have to calculate 14 days daily range. Instead you use anticipated daily range, which is DailyTopLevel0 - DailyBotLevel0. You can multiply this with your 3/4 (0.75) ratio to find your TP value. You will see that (DailyTopLevel0 - DailyBotLevel0) is more valuable than simple average daily range.. That is my 2 cents. Good Luck...

Hi, GoldTheHun. There is an error in this line i think. The line " C lose[i]- C lose[i+1]" has to be changed to " c lose[i]- c lose[i+1]". Try it and you'll see the difference in levels.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi Dezil, I honestly don't see the difference. It looks like you wrote the same line twice...

--- 帖子 #315 ---
No, it's not the same line. You have to use " c lose" instead of " C lose". I takes me a lot of time to figure out why oroginal ATR-Close.mq4 does not calculete average value right.

Here is the declaration of main function of ATR-Close.mq4. I marked the line. That's why we have to use close array not Close. int OnCalculate(const int rates_total, const int prev_calculated, const datetime &amp;time[], const double &amp;open[], const double &amp;high[], const double &amp;low[], const double &amp;close[], const long &amp;tick_volume[], const long &amp;volume[], const int &amp;spread[])

It has always fascinated me how someone can believe in random walk and, using indicators which INDICATE a direction in the market. Support and resistance are meaninless if you truly believe markets are random. The markets are not predictable 100% but the market has probabilities so is not random. A random market could not be effected or moved by FOMC, BOC, BOE, EU, BOJ or Goldman Sachs. Belief in Random walk theory but using charting technique is like saying “I believe the earth is round and I believe the earth is flat.”

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi Newbegger, I respect your view. However there is a misconception in what you state. Random Walk does not mean markets are random. The motion of the markets are random walk, which is Volatility * SquareRoot of Time. It just gives boundaries where prices can go within certain period of time, which we call Support and Resistance. Random Walk does not indicate the direction of the markets.. FYI all the Option prices are calculated using Random Walk, with the formula Volatility * Sqrt(Time). Good Luck...

Hi GTH, I'm back for a refresher, so just reread thread. First let me compliment you on your patience. You have gone into great depth on all questions, even repeat questions, and questions regarding answers given in basic instructions. (Like some ?'s I asked early on... ) Price is Random (in my mind), so using set ups with some degree of reliability, can provide wins. I've been working with H4 charts using 2 ma's, which are only there to provide a line in the sand. With fixed entries, short stops, and no profit levels to begin with, wins happen about 1/2 the time or less, and I catch an occasional nice run. Profit levels generally average 2.4, or 1:2.4 (Risk:Reward). Right now I'm digesting what is written here, and seeing if I can either improve my method or + yours. Will keep you posted. Happiest of New Years to everyone. Darryl

First of all Happy New Year to you Darryl... And second of all , thank you for your positive comments and for taking the time to post this video. To be honest with you, I am still searching for a method to use these levels. The levels work, no doubt about that. I have tested these levels since 2007 and I know that they work. The only problem I have is deciding whether to go long or short for the day. I have done so many statistics including price action and all kinds of indicators, maximum percentage of getting the direction of the day right is a mere %53.. Is there an edge? Yes, definitely. So how do I approach exploiting this edge ? First of all I accept the percentage as %50 -%50 of each day going up or down (typical random). And I use Labouchère system for trading ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labouch%C3%A8re_system ). So as a result if I trade long than D1Res0 is my Take Profit Level and D1Sup0 is my SL level. It is a %50 proposition. This will make you money in the long run, no matter what. As long as you know how to manage your capital and trade accordingly... I wish you Happy Holidays.....

Happy New year all. I must have downloaded the indies shared here from someplace else but I couldn't get my head around how to use them. Directions not the issue for me, committing to my targets, and the only problem I can see with this approach is when the daily open on a Bullish day is above Fib 78 and doesn't retrace to it before going up, thankfully there are several Pivot points that are likely to be reached or breached. The Random walk theory comes alive when you trade micro time frames or Renko box sizes, you never know when the big money will move price in a specific direction or when a range would start, you just have to find an entry and commit to your target or be cut to pieces by their random movements. Thank to GH for sharing.

I see I am supposed to invert the fib tool.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks Intrepidpips... Your Fib tool is correct now. It is better if you only have 0 to 100 levels in the Fib tool and no other values, it becomes more clearer. Happy New Year.....

Hi GoldTheHun, Just discovered your thread. Some time back I modified a well-known, related indicator (i-Reg) plotting the z-scores as support and resistance levels across regressions of up to 8 polynomial degrees. It is continuous and not anchored to the first bar of the Australian session, though. They help influence ones perception for manual trading but that's about it : all my automation efforts failed. Cheers - keep up this positive thread. Claus

Hi Claus, thank you for sharing your method and for your positive comments. I think your method is a solid idea, very interesting. I will definitely try it. Thanks.. Good Luck...

Thanks for sharing, wish it has previous day high and lows with an option to hide which levels you don't want to display. I observed the RW S&amp;R and it looks like R0 &amp;R1 seems to be magnets in an up trend.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Welcome Intrepidpips.. Unfortunately I don't have an indicator for prev day Highs and Lows... As you say R0 and R1 will be like magnets during uptrend and S0 and S1 would be magnets in downtrends. But I would much rather rely on R0 and S0. Higher probability of the price hitting those levels during the day... Good Luck....

--- 帖子 #338 ---
@Goldthehun,what about this for identifying the trend..using heiken ashi bars,if the previous day ends up green go long for the day or if it ends up red go short, what do you think?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Nozzer, thank you for your suggestion however I have tried that and the results are almost %50 - %50... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #340 ---
ok ,thank you

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I find that having a Risk to reward ratio of 1:1 will have a much higher win rate rather then letting it touch the R0. Is it better this way?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Very Interesting method. I understand it I believe, the only problem I have is if I am using H1 charts, do I use the previous day's fib levels to buy for the current day ? My broker resets at 5 PM EST. So at 5:01 pm I set my buy or sell depending on the trend I have determined and then I use the previous days fib levels yes ?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Also is the fib level from D1 sup0 to D1 Res0 ? or top to bottom of previous days movement ?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
When a new day opens, the levels are recalculated for this day. The levels do not use previous day prices (open, high, low, close). The fib level is drawn always between D1 Sup0 and D1 Res0... Good luck.....

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Thx. I'll test it out. How long have you been trading this way and how profitable ave you been ? It seems too easy lol. But sometimes simple works.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I have never claimed to have profited from this because I still don't have a method to enter long or short for the day. It still is a %50-%50 proposition..

I started to experiment on this one... with my trading system &gt;&gt;&gt; herein Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Your Thread is Excellent - Outstanding Randomwalk - The Unbeatable Till Date i never had read a complete thread. This was the 1st Thread i read full in my life. Your understanding and words were great The motion of the markets are random walk, which is Volatility * SquareRoot of Time. Its all related to Price - Time - Action and Action is Volatility The concept is also great but if 1 can understand. Keep up the great work Thanks &amp; regards

Quoting GoldTheHun Val_Bands-ATR-Close calculates the average differently.. This version was written for old builds of MQL. It uses start() function, not OnCalculate(). In this case we use Close[] array Post 320 Dec 29, 2017 16:08 https://cdn-assets.faireconomy.media...ar390439_1.gif GoldTheHun Joined Nov 2014 | Status: Member | 392 Posts Quoting Dezil {quote} This version was written for old builds of MQL.

RandomWalk All Time Return: 10.3% Hello GodTheHun, Thanks for this indicator and your explanations. I have been giving it some serious visual backtests and so far good enough. I was wondering about the code error Dezil mentions in post 320(above quote), does it make major difference in the way the lines come out since this is majorly a reversal indicator and, i've noticed there is a lot of mere touch on the line when price reverses/hence sensitivity. or is it(the error) negligible? Secondly, the indices, am noticing normally have less than the 288 per day 5min data. Does it take data from the previous n-2 day to augment for the total 288? Thanks.

Anyone backtested this method? considering flipping a coin on daily trend
