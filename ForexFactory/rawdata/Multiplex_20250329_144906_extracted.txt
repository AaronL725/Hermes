"Multiplex" is using a combination of following strategies: Live Trading Time Cell Trading: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=249257 Two-Way-Confirmation-Strategy: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=297304 TraCop-1%: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=212160 Sicko-Scalp-Machine: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=281532 Scalping 10 sec., 30 sec., M1: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=222387 Wellcome FXtrader ! Be aware some points, please before beginning to read the MP-Trading system below. Radical acceptance is a key mental strategy for coping with market uncertainty. Many traders make the mistake of thinking they can control the markets. Nobody can control the markets. We must learn to accept anything that comes our way and to trade accordingly. Adopt the attitude that trading is a journey and that all we can do is go where the markets take us. Another thing you can do is to make sure you have a life. Trading can be addictive especially when you are winning. Do not put all your emotional eggs in the trading basket. You need to have other roles that give your life meaning and purpose. By defining your identity in a variety of ways, you will not place un-natural importance on trading events. Therefore, you will be able to take losses in stride and look at your trading more objectively. Might be better also, to accept your limitations and work around them, ...and become a winning trader. Possibly, write out your trading plan with precise entry and exit points and as well important, test your system on paper and when confident test in real time with the minimum contract size. You will have losing trades, accept them with grace and go on to the next trade. So you need to make sure your trading system fits your trading personality; otherwise you will find it hard to follow it. Every trader has different needs and goals, thus there is no system that perfectly fits all traders. You need to make your own research on various trading styles and technical indicators until you find a concept that perfectly works for you. Make sure you know the nature of whatever technical indicator used. May be "Multiplex" could something for you by finding several trading systems or strategies that suits your life - not the other way around! Now let us speak the topic. Multiplex "Multiplex" is a manual trading strategy. Trades could be triggered within different time frames and can used in ranging and in trending markets. "Multiplex" has used since January 2011. You can use "Multiplex" like a "Modular Design" only by using some indicators (e.g. CCI) in combination with the price action (e.g. engulfing patterns, hammers, shooting stars, in bars) and the Pivotal Points (see # 14 , # 16 ) or more complex with regard to the EMA Lines, the Stochastics and/or the MACD. It's simple and efficient! If you will get other arguments more, so look at the extreme points at Murrey Math. The EMA lines will show you apart from price action momentum and if there is either a trending environment or a ranging market. Applying Filters and Indicators Now, the CCI formation seems easy, but like anything else regarding strategy and technical analysis, it's always good to have buffers or filters in addition to the main signal. You see in the indicator list below that there are over 8-12 indicators. This way, there is more confirmation to take into account before placing your buy or sell entry. So let's show you the indicators and then a few examples (see "Trade Examples"). Indicators: - BB14, - EMA 5, 13, 21, 55, 200, - CCI (14), - ADX14, - Full Stochastics 5,3,3 (SSD), - MACD, - Pivot Points Optional: Price Action, Trendlines, Fibonacci, Murrey Math, RSI(14) Also I have some simple exponential moving averages e.g. EMA5, 13, 21, 55 to give me clues on the strength of a trend and the likelihood of mass traders entry, also an EMA 200 as a long term moving s/r. Indicator trustfulness? Whatever seems to work for you is fine! Currencies: all (&amp; commodities) Time Frames: all Keep an eye on the clock: Pay attention to London open (6 to 8 A.M. London time), the New York open (6 to 8 A.M. New York time) and the London close (5 to 6 P.M. London time). The markets move when these traders open and close their trades for the day. Live Trading : Orders are often published in live. Thread Rules These are not onerous, so break them and I will ban you: Be constructive, friendly and helpful. You may be critical: You are allowed to say: "This will not work because......" You are not allowed to say: "This is lunacy and your are all cretins. Only dimwits trade lile this." Not twice, anyhow. Do not ask questions the answers to which are to be found in this post. It took me a time to prepare. Showing by the stupidity of your question that you cannot be bothered to read it properly will annoy me. I will allow my annoyance to show; bluntly; just before banning you from further posting.

Trade Example GBPCHF, M15, 2011 June 30 Trading from the Bottom to the Hill with the Stochastics and the price action (e.g.Inside Bar) Enter Long at the Bottom of the Stochastics and the Inside Bar. The Exit Level is given by the Top of the Stochastics and the Uppler Line of the Bollinger Band. Long @ 1.3333 (mS1) Exit @ 1.3375 (EMA55) Profit: + 42 pips

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Trade Example USDCHF, H1, 2011 June 30 Trading the Pivotals with the Stochastics and/or MACD Enter Long: CCI(14) lies down at his Bottom with +DI ,so is also the Stochastic &amp; the MACD located. Exit: Market Price has reached the EMA200 and this seems for me a good exit level in combination with the higher ADX Value and the Stochastics has reached its Top, too. Long @ 0.8305 (DS1) Exit @ 0.8376 (DR1) Profit: +71 pips

--- 帖子 #7 ---
EURUSD, H4, 2011 June 30 6 Powerful Arguments for an Enter Short. High CCI, Stochastics &amp; MACD Value, Pivotal 1.4475 (DR1) before 1.4517 (DR2) has reached, high ADX value and -DI Bottom Short @ 1.4475 (DR1)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Trade Example EURUSD, M15, 2011 June 30 EURUSD, M1, 2011 June 30 Scalping Top &amp; Bottom Tading with the CCI and the Stochastics Overview: If you take a look at M15 you see indifferent candles with an ADX below 25 by a parallel running RSI. Short-Time-Trading: Good time for scalping at M1/M5. CCI(14) and/or Stochastics Tops &amp; Bottoms could be used for the Entries &amp; Exits. The M1 Divergence don't have much power. The Divergence Design is at the smallest timeframes (10sec., 30 sec., M1) not valid and reliable.

WOW. ...So many indicators and all from different systems...seems like you just put every system you could find took there indcicators and some of the rules.....then threw them all together.........Not very impressed. Im going to keep an eye on your thread cause would like to see people try and use this cluster of indicators all at once without being lost about enter,exit,SL,TP,BE or even the trend. Seen most of your charts from this thread and the other ones....how come no SL in any of your "profit" shots? not even a mental or really far hard stop.....Just wondering........... *EDIT* Just looked at your "Trading Journals".....all of them using these systems you keep trying to sell newbie traders on....How come if its a good system and profitable all your accounts ended up far less then when you started?.....Just Wondering again.............

CCI &amp; Pivotal Points a really excellent Hybrid How strong could be the arguments if you trade to the exclusion of the CCI peaks &amp; its valleys? One important tandem accelarator seems for me the CCI Trading in the combination with the pivotal points. The Example below demonstrate a classical market environment, where could often use the "alpine combination" of only two single indicators to make good money. This excellent hybrid is "simple", "fast analysed" &amp; "effective".

Pivotal Points Professional traders and market makers use pivot points to identify potential support and resistance levels. Simply put, a pivot point and its support/resistance levels are areas at which the direction of price movement can possibly change. Read more: http://www.babypips.com/school/forex...#ixzz1IIKDcpib Standard Pivot Points Pivot points are very useful tools that use the previous bars' highs, lows and closings to project support and resistance levels for future bars. The following pivot point tables are based on standard pivot point formula. Five time frames are provided: hourly, 4 hours, daily, weekly, monthly. For other types of pivot points, please check out the pages below. http://www.actionforex.com/markets/p...2010040848154/ See further: Fibonacci Pivots Camarilla Pivots Woodie's Pivots DeMark's Pivots

A classic example of a strategy which will produce wonderful pips in a strong trending market and which will blow your account in a ranging market The simplest of MA crossovers will produce the same result Any system that relies on more than 2 indicators will result in: 1. Over analysis that misses a big chunk of the main trend 2. Absolute disaster in a ranging market 3. The death of this thread in less than a month

Annotation Most of the trades will be done without any Stop Loss Concept. Order-/Risk-/Depot- and Money Management have to consider it. Minus 200 - 500 pips per order could be possible at "Higher Time Frame Orders" (H4/Daily) . Much of these trades will be hedged under certain market conditions. Strongly recommended: Minimum 25'000.-$ Account

Trading without stop loss implement a "WpD:OLO" around 1:10 Rule of Jumb Ratio 1:10 The Ratio "Win per Day" to all "Open Loosing Orders" is 1:10, say after 10 trading the negative Saldo at all open orders should be counterbalanced when using this trading strategy "Multiplex" at advanced level (experienced traders), but of course there are obvious exceptions. Trading without Stop Loss call for an effective Order Managment. How to manage open orders is another topic which could explained later. Read it as a Rough-And-Ready-Rule . Example: You make 1'000.-$ Profit today so you could have a total minus from all open trades simultaneously about ~10'000.-$. After 2 trading weeks (10 trading days) this negative saldo should have been balanced. It's like a covered cheque. It's like a price to earning ratio (P/E) in inverse ratio.

Impulse Effectively halted At Forexfactory there are many excellent trading systems. All inclusive the "Multiplex" one of this thread here have a great impact of wins. I argue: "With the RM-, MM- and MTFA-concept you'll get an infinitive deal more!" (RM - Risk Management, MM - Moneymanagement, MFTA - Multiple Time Frame Analysis). Why suffer many good trading concepts under "difficult market situation" when the market price will move against it? Many traders are of the opinion that they can count of "Stop Loss", to trust the "Stop Loss" to do something, in particular hold the losses minor. "Go out and keep your losses small!" you hear often. But for all that when coming full circle - "do you really recognize that in this moment you have abdicate responsibility?" To delegate responsibility cause charges? First the price of the lost order, second the price of the non-profitable order and third a psychological moment. Might be I can invite you to think a little about the "Anti-Stop-Loss-Pro-Hedging-Pro-Multiple-Time-Frame-Concept" in the next "green flag lap". "Perhaps some way or other you could realize that whatever system you trade you could earn 20-80% more!" Might be that this coping style is the clue of this important difference between the 95% loosing traders and the 5% winning traders. The most systems here on board are excellent! Might be the trading style cut profits. Kindest regards FX Cube

If you intend to have more sucess in Forextrading it could be an advantage to become overcast with the Game Theory. Game theory is the study of the ways in which strategic interactions among economic agents produce outcomes with respect to the preferences (or utilities ) of those agents, where the outcomes in question might have been intended by none of the agents. Wer Kenntnisse in Spieltheorie besitzt könnte mehr das Forextrading zu seinem Vorteil nutzen. Forextrading impliziert dass das Ergebnis der Entscheidung von den Entscheidungen anderer Akteure abhängt. Drohungen, Bluff, asymmetrische Informationen (nur die Spieler selbst kennen ihre wahren Präferenzen, nicht aber die Mitspieler), ehrliche und falsche Signale sind das Salz verfeinerter spieltheoretischer Modelle. Normative Spieltheorie versucht optimale Entscheidungen in einer gegebenen Interaktionsstruktur zu finden. Die normative Theorie stellt die Frage danach, wie ein rationaler Akteur handeln soll, wenn alle andere Akteure sich gleichfalls an rationale Entscheidungskriterien orientieren. Desweiteren haben nichtkoperative Theorien wichtige Resultate erzielt die auf Forexmärkte grundlegend übertragbar sind. Das risikovermeidende Maximin-Prinzip besagt: Wähle die Strategie, bei der im Vergeich zu allen anderen Strategien der schlechtmögliche Ausgang immer noch besser oder mindestens gleich gut ist als das schlechteste Ergebnis bei allen anderen Alternativen. Maximin entspricht dem pessimistischen "worst case"-Denken. http://books.google.ch/books?hl=de&amp;l...heorie&amp;f=false http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory http://books.google.ch/books?hl=de&amp;l...page&amp;q&amp;f=false http://www.12manage.com/methods_game_theory_de.html http://books.google.ch/books?hl=de&amp;l...0games&amp;f=false http://www.socio.ethz.ch/education/fs10/egt http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/handle/2042/28548 http://books.google.ch/books?hl=de&amp;l...page&amp;q&amp;f=false http://www.gametheory.net/lectures/l...&amp;highlight=PDF http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/ Buchtip: Diekmann Andreas, Spieltheorie, (Einführung, Beispiele, Experimente), rororo, ISBN 978-3-499-55701-9, August 2010

Trade Example Powerful Arguments for Entry Long EURUSD, H4, 2011 July 03 If you want to use oscillators effectively you should train yourself to recognize situations when they are close to giving their signals (e.g. by using a daily checklist or so). It is also a good idea to combine different indicators to fine-tune your entries or exits and to crosscheck their signals (e.g. Stochastic and RSI give their best signals when they are both in overbought or oversold territory; Stochastic divergence is more powerful when it is backed up by MACD divergence).

--- 帖子 #31 ---
What is Stochastics? Stochastic is plotted on the vertical scale from 0 to 100.It measures a currency pair's ability to close near the top or the bottom of the recent price range (usually the last 14 days). In an up trend prices will tend to close near the highest recent price, resulting in above 50 reading on Stochastic. In a down trend prices will tend to close near the lowest recent price, resulting in below 50 reading on Stochastic. When a trend approaches its turning point the closing prices will usually move away from the highest/lowest price of the recent price range. If the prices rise during the day but cannot close near the highest price of the last 14 days - the 14-day Stochatsic will turn down. If the prices fall during the day but cannot close near the lowest price of the last 14 days - the 14-day Stochastic will turn up. When Stochastic rises above the 80 level a currency pair is considered to be overbought. When it falls bellow the 20 level the pair is said to be oversold (see # 30 , Point 4). Stochastic is used primarily on the daily charts. There are 2 types of Stochastic - the fast and the slow Stochastic, the slow one being the most commonly used among the forex trading community . A Stochastic is made up from two lines - the fast line, called %K and the slow line, called %D (which is a smoothed %K line). The %D line is more important and should be first reviewed for the signals. A short-term Stochastic (e.g. 5 days) can be used to catch minor currency price reversals; a longer-term Stochastic (e.g. 14 or 21 days) can be used to capture more important market turns. Stochastic Signals Apart from indicating overbought and oversold market conditions Stochastic gives 2 types of signals - when it diverges from the currency prices and when its lines cross. Stochastic gives its most powerful signals when it diverges from the prices. A bearish divergence occurs when a currency pair rises to a new high but the %D line fails to move above its previous peak. The bullish divergence occurs when a currency pair falls to a new low but the %D line fails to move below its previous bottom (see # 30 , Point 6). The actual signal to act is given when the %K line crosses above the %D line for bullish divergencies or below it for bearish divergencies. The closer the first %D point is to an extreme reading and the further it is from the second point - the stronger the bullish or the bearish signal given by Stochastic.

What is MACD? MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is used mainly to anticipate crossovers between two exponential moving averages (usually the 12-period and the 26-period EMA of closing prices). This forex indicator consists of two lines - the fast MACD line which is the difference between the two moving averages and the slow Signal line which is the 9-period exponential moving average of the MACD line. When the fast MACD line is above the zero level this means that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average. The opposite is the case when the fast MACD line is below the zero line. The MACD line moves to zero when the two moving averages coincide. A histogram is used to clarify the difference between the MACD and the Signal line - by scaling each of its bars to clearly represent the distance between the two. Unlike Stochastic and RSI, this indicator is not bounded by a maximum or a minimum value; therefore, you should use the levels reached by MACD at past market tops and bottoms as benchmarks against which to evaluate its movement. MACD Signals: The most common signals occur when the MACD line crosses the Signal line . A bullish signal is generated when the MACD line crosses above the Signal line - when the lines are below the zero level. A bearish signal is produced when MACD line crosses below the Signal line - when the lines are above the zero level. The further crossover is from the zero level the stronger its signal. These crossover signals are in essence warning that the dead or the golden moving average cross (which occurs when MACD line crosses the zero level) has a high probability of happening in the near future. When histogram starts to move towards the zero line while the prices are still actively trending this is often seen as an early indication that crossover signal can soon be given. The following picture shows two types of signals in action. http://www.forexhit.com/images/macd-...-signal-cr.gif Click to Enlarge. Chart Source - ProCharts The second type of signals are given when MACD line diverges from the currency prices . A bullish signal is given when a currency pair makes new lows while MACD line does not. A bearish signal is given when a new price high is not accompanied by a new MACD line high. Some traders use histogram divergencies in the same manner as MACD line divergencies are used. http://www.forexhit.com/images/macd-...ergence-cr.gif Click to Enlarge.

How to Use MACD in Forex Trading - MACD Divergence - MACD Convergence By Vahid | Category: Technical Analysis | Wednesday, May 20th, 2009 MACD is one of the most reliable indicators. Although I do not believe in using indicators in my own trading and I always use the price candlestick chart to find the trade setups, I look at MACD direction when I find a signal on the price chart. So I use MACD as a confirmation and it really works for me. Why MACD works? This is a million dollar question. Before I answer this question that why MACD works, I prefer to explain about one of the most important reasons of forex traders’ (and also all other kind of traders’)failure. Maybe you have heard this a lot from us but it has to be reminded in this article too. Lack of patience is one of the most important reasons of forex traders failure. Most traders are not patient enough to wait for a good trade setup. After several minutes, hours or days that they wait for a signal (depend on the time frame or system they use), and they can not find any signal, they lose their patience and force themselves to take a position while there is no sharp and clear signal. So they lose. On the other hand, when they succeed to take a good position, they get out too early with a small profit because they are afraid of losing the profit they have already made. They do not have enough patience to hold a position until it hits the target. So they make their profit limited because of lack of patience. MACD is a solution for this problem because it is so delayed and this delay forces you to wait more, both when you are waiting for a trade setup or when you already have a position. That’s why MACD is recommended both by forex and stock traders. There are a lot of cases that your other indicators and even the price chart show you a signal but MACD tells you wait and it keeps you from going against the trend and losing money. There are also a lot of cases that you want to follow a trend but MACD tells you it is too late and the trend is exhausted and may reverse very soon. In this article, I will do my best to cover all of these cases and help you use MACD in your trades in the best way. What is MACD Definition? MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence / Divergence. MACD is an indicator which is used in technical analysis . This indicator is developed by Gerald Appel who was a trader and market technical analyst. MACD is the difference of a 12 and a 26 exponential moving average . MACD subtracts the 26-period from the 12-period and the result will be displayed in a single line which is the MACD main line. Typical MACD indicators, have one extra line, which is a simple moving average of the main line. This moving average is set to 9 by default. In MetaTrader, the default MACD doesn’t have the main MACD line. Instead, it has bars (histogram). On other platforms, you can see both the MACD main line and MACD histogram. MACD Formula: If you are a trader, probably MACD formula will have no use for you. You will need it, if you are a programmer and want to use MACD in designing and developing an EA (expert advisor) or robot. Download the Colored MACD: The MACD that comes with MetaTrader by default, has only one color with the histograms. If you like to have the same colored MACD we have on our charts, please download and install it to your platform before we start explaining about MACD and the way we use it in technical analysis and forex trading. This indicator works in MetaTrader. You need to copy and paste it to the /experts/indicators/ folder and then restart your platform and apply the indicator on the price chart: Click Here How Does MACD Looks Like on The Price Chart? The below chart shows how colored MACD looks like. It also has the Simple Moving Average (9) but I always set it to 0 because I don’t need it. It doesn’t help. In the indicator you downloaded above, it is set to 0 by default, but you can change it back to 9 if you like. The MACD bars (histogram) you see below, reflect the difference of the 12 and 26 exponential moving average. On the price chart, you see two exponential moving averages. The green one is the 26 and the red one is the 12. As you see, wherever the distance of these two moving averages is longer, the MACD bars are longer too and wherever these two moving averages cross, the length of the related MACD bar is zero (follow the arrows). As you see, when there is an upward (Bullish) movement and pressure, MACD goes up and changes its color to blue and when there is a downward (Bearish) pressure and movement, it goes down and changes its color to red. http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-1.gif MACD bars form highs and lows. When we have an uptrend, they form higher highs and when we have a downtrend, they form lower highs and when the bars go under the zero level, they form lower lows: http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-2.gif http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-3.gif How does MACD save you from going against the trend? As I mentioned, MACD is delayed and so when you see a reversal signal with the candlesticks and Bollinger Bands and you want to take a position against the trend, MACD tells you “No”. Of course, if you know about the Elliott Waves and also the cycles, you will not take any position against the trend even if you don’t have MACD on your chart, but as knowing the cycles and Elliott Waves is very difficult, you can use MACD to stay on the right way. For example, you see the below reversal. A candle is formed completely out of the Bollinger Band and then there are three Bearish candles that are all reversal signals. Three candles before this, you already had another reversal but you should have ignored it because it was fresh and came just after a big Bullish candle. But, the second sell signal (in the yellow zone), assured you that you can go short. Lets say you wouldn’t have MACD on your chart or you wouldn’t pay any attention to it. You could go short and set your stop loss above the highest high. http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-4.gif and guess what? Your stop loss would be triggered: http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-5.gif So going against MACD is dangerous. But, it is not the only mistake you can make. MACD also indicates if market is overbought or oversold. When it is overbought, it is risky to go long and when it is oversold, it is risky to go short. When market is overbought, Bulls (buyers) can start collecting their profit (they sell) at any time and so the price goes down and when market is oversold, Bears can start buying at any time and so the price may go up. Of course, the candles also tell you if market is overbought or oversold, but MACD is also a big help. Lets see an example. http://www.forexoma.com/how-to-use-m...stock-trading/

Follow-up. You are a trend trader. You have an uptrend here. You see some reversal signals but you wait for a continuation signal to go long. A strong Bullish candle forms (the last candle) and at the same time the last MACD bar changes it color and shows an upward pressure. This is what you have been waiting for to go long but you don’t consider that market has been going up for a long time and can reverse at any time. Of course it could go much higher, but we never know. http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-6.gif This position goes up only for one more candle and then goes down and triggers your stop loss: http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-7.gif MACD Buy-Sell Signals: MACD trading is so common among forex traders. They just wait for a fresh MACD movement for a few bars and then they enter. MACD is really good for trend trading. It is also good for confirming the reversal signals. However, MACD has to be used as a confirmation. The main indicator is the price chart and technical analysis. If you use MACD as a confirmation for support and resistance break, it will be a big help. Look at the below image. There is a trend line with valid and visible support line. You are waiting for the support breakdown to go short. MACD starts going down for several candles before the break down, but you don’t go short because it can bounce up as soon as it touches the support line. One of the candles closes below the support line and at the same time, you see that MACD is going down, BUT it is fresh and it is not oversold. It is above the zero level too. So you go short at the open of the next candle, set your stop loss above the high price of last candle and your target will be the next support level. It goes down and hits the target very easily. http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-8.gif Now look at the below image which is in fact the same as the above image, but it just shows another support break down which happens a while after the above support breakdown. Obviously, it is a new chance to take another short position, but look at the MACD and its difference with the previous position. In the previous position, MACD had started going down while it was way above the zero level. It means, you would go short while market has been overbought which is a good decision. In this position (below), not only MACD is not above the zero level, but it has already started going up and making higher lows. So market is oversold and your sell signal is not fresh. It is a second hand sell signal http://www.forexoma.com/wp-includes/...icon_smile.gif and guess what happens if you would go short and would not consider MACD: http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-9.gif So your position triggers the stop loss before it hits the target. http://www.forexoma.com/how-to-use-m...stock-trading/

MACD Divergence: MACD Divergence is one of the most famous and strongest trading signals that MACD generates. MACD Divergence forms when the price goes up and makes higher highs and at the same time, MACD bars go down and make lower highs. The rule says, the price will finally follow the MACD direction and will break down. However, the problem is, you never know when the price will follow the MACD direction. So, if you rush and take a short position right when you see a MACD Divergence, it may keep on going up for several more candles. You should go short when MACD Divergence is followed by a good sell signal by the candles and/or a support break down. This is safer. MACD Divergence can be seen at the end of uptrends. What does it mean? It means if you are a trend trader, you should not go long when you see that a MACD Divergence is formed. It can collapse at any time. http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-10.gif MACD Convergence: MACD Convergence is also a famous signal but people trust the MACD Divergence more because when the market goes down and collapses, it goes faster and stronger. Fear is stronger than greed and when market goes down, fear is the dominant emotion. MACD Convergence forms when price goes down and forms lower highs or lower lows but at the same time MACD bars go up and form higher highs or higher lows. The rule says, the price will finally change the direction and will follow MACD which means it goes up. MACD Convergence can be seen at the end of downtrends. What does it mean? It means if you are a trend trader, you should not go short when you see that a MACD Convergence is formed. It can jump up at any time. http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts/macd/macd-11.gif http://www.forexoma.com/how-to-use-m...stock-trading/

Two Powerful 21st Century Forex Indicators What worked in the markets a few years back may not work anymore. The right choice of forex indicators in your forex trading is of utmost importance. Trading with the wrong forex indicators will only make you end up frustrated. Now, to tell you the inconvenient truth, free indicators like the stochastics, moving averages, MACD, bollinger bands, RSIs and others simply don’t work anymore. Why? When everyone starts using the same indicators, they lose their efficacy in predicting the markets. You see technical analysis is just the study of the short term price action in the market. Now, this short term price action is determined by the buyers and sellers in the market. Markets are just buyers and sellers trying to buy or sell. Their emotions rule the markets. When everyone starts trading with the same indicators, they become useless in predicting the market turning points. This is the precise reason why when some technical indicator becomes highly popular, it becomes useless or you can say it loses it’s effectiveness in predicting the market. But these two forex indicators are so powerful that you should watch them in action if you really want to catapult your forex trading to the highest possible level. 1. Slingshot Indicator Slingshot Indicator does precisely what it’s name suggests. It works like a slingshot of a trend reversal. This indicator has been developed by Gary R. Albrecht, a former pharmaceutical industry executive now a professional forex trader. Some use simple technical indicators like the ADX, moving averages and others combined with candlestick patterns. Slingshot indicator is meant to make your trend trading highly accurate and efficient. What this indicator does is to setup the SLINGSHOT of a trend reversal that can be highly profitable. 2. US Dollar Index Indicator Professional forex traders always watch the US Dollar Index to judge the strength or weakness of US Dollar. US Dollar Index measures the strength or weakness of US Dollar against a basket of six currencies that includes the GBP, EUR, CHF, JPY, CAD and SEK. Knowing the performance of the USD against the major currencies can be really helpful in forming your bias or what you call the market sentiment. http://www.howtoinvesttoday.com/2010...ex-indicators/

Slingshot Forex Reversal Strategy Written by Aboutcurrency A slingshot reversal is a reliable forex trading pattern and is defined as a false breakout + reversal and occurs when a major support or resistance point is broken but the currency price does not hold below support or above resistance and moves back into it's previous trading range. The picture below shows a slingshot reversal pattern for the GBP/USD on the 1 hour chart. On May 15th, the GBP/USD finally broke out it's trading range between 1.9845 (1) and 1.9762 (2). This break below support created a wave of new downside pressure as longs cut their positions and traders sold the technical break below support. http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...l_in_forex.gif GBP/USD Slingshot Reversal Pattern Then a slingshot reversal pattern took place as the cable sellers ran out of steam below 1.9733 (3) and buyers gained the upper hand, and very soon, the GBP/USD start gaining back above it's previous support level only to move higher to 1.9870. How to trade the slingshot reversal pattern: 1) Try to identify important levels of support and resistance that many forex traders are closely watching 2) When trading 1 hour charts, wait for the market to trade 10 pips below or above the key level (either support or resistance); then put a stop entry order 10 pips above or below that KEY level. In our case: When 1.9752 (1.9762 - 10 pips) trades, place an order to BUY cable at 1.9772 (4). 3) If the order is executed, then place your stop 3 pips below it's previous low(3) at 1.9730. 4) Calculating your profit target for 1.5:1 risk-to-reward ratio: Pips at risk: 1.9772-1.9730 = 42 pips. Here's our take profit target: 42 pips x 1.5= 63 pips (5) Summary: The forex slingshot reversal is a reliable pattern with a strong logic behind it because of it's effect on market positioning. Look for major support and resistance levels that could yield forex slingshot reversals. http://www.aboutcurrency.com/strateg...strategy.shtml

CCI Commodities Channel Index Breakout Strategy Commodities Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator that measures the strength of the current market cycle and attempts to predict when it will end. CCI indicator default measurements are +100 to -100. When the indicator is above +100, the market is considered to be overbought and when it is below -100, the market is considered to be oversold. Now, when the CCI value falls below +100, it means the market is breaking out of its overbought condition. Many traders take it as signal to sell. Similarly, when CCI value rises above -100, it means the market is coming out of its oversold condition. Traders take it as a signal to buy. In this CCI Breakout strategy, we will be using CCI breakouts in combination with the usual support and resistance on the daily charts. Let’s discuss the details of the CCI Breakout Strategy! Suppose, CCI oscillator value rises above -100 or falls below the +100 level. When this happens, it means that the market is coming out of its oversold or overbought condition. This breakout is usually followed by a retracement or a pullback before the market again start continuing in the direction of the breakout. Place an entry order at the open price of the daily candle that appeared on the breakout. What this means is that the price action will make a retracement and in most cases your entry order will get filled on the following day. But in some cases, the momentum is strong enough for the price action to move forward for several days without making any pullback. In case, this happens and the entry order at the open price of the breakout candle that you had placed does not get filled for the next five trading days or the CCI oscillator again goes above +100 or below -100, simple cancel the entry order and wait for the next chance to place the trade. As you have a day before the entry order will get filled in most cases, you can plan your trade well with this CCI Breakout Strategy. In the CCI Breakout Strategy, you will place the stop loss below the immediate low prior to the CCI Breakout or above the immediate high set prior to the breakout. In case of a trend, use Fibonacci Extensions and in case of a range use Fibonacci Retracement. Calculate your risk and reward and only enter into a trade if the Risk to Reward Ratio is less than 1:3 otherwise simply skip and wait for another trade to develop. As always first master this CCI Breakout Strategy on your demo account. You can also use a trailing stop once the trade turns profitable equal to the amount that you had risked.

Hello ForexCube I have looked at all your trades and based on your indicators they all make sense. For the short entry on the AUD/USD there is an additonal price action that confirms this entry. When the bollinger bands expand into a "kind-off cigar" shape and then touch again, there is a 2 out of 3 chance that it will give you a good trade. In my attachement there a 2 circles and one square. The circles mean BB touched twice after cigar shape AND stoc confirmed. I wrote an EA for it but it was crap. I then changed it to alarming only and added my own brain power/commen sense to it.....and it got much better :-) This works based on MTF charting but I still like to look at the weather ahead.....as there might be monkeys running around. Have a good week Larry

Very little liquidity these nice summer days! Today mostly some things going on in the morning, and then very calm again. So plenty of time to have a look over your shoulder and see what you are doing technicalwise, down there i Switzerland. I hope the weather is as fine as here in Sweden, and i hope the lilies turned out OK my friend! I would post photos but my erhm... domestic situation after i broke up with my wife dont allow it yet. Looks like in general you are trading the way you usually trade: You wait for an exhaustion in the form of a divergence and enter at the turning point of the former move. I can see how the bollys is still the area where you look to place your position. Thats what i see when i look at those trades.

Also more comments will follow about the Multiple Time Frame Analysis and I will work out a pool and/or a ranking list about the powerful arguments based on technical indicators and a selective dominant measurement which should allow to distinguish currency pairs with a better profit chance when making the analysis. My intention is moreover to explain how I trade in my way of traing style and may be here and there it could help or give another aspect or ideas to other interested traders in their trading life. Put out what you can use and let rest the other things! Your pictures are full of nature every time. I love all of it. Best regards FXcube

Dec. 12, 1863, Löten, Nor.--d. Jan. 23, 1944, Ekely, near Oslo) Norwegian painter and printmaker whose intense, evocative treatment of psychological and emotional themes was a major influence on the development of German Expressionism in the early 20th century. His painting The Cry (1893) is regarded as an icon of existential anguish. A gifted Norwegian painter and printmaker, Edvard Munch not only was his country's greatest artist, but also played a vital role in the development of German expressionism. His work often included the symbolic portrayal of such themes as misery, sickness, and death. The Cry, probably his most familiar painting, is typical in its anguished expression of isolation and fear.

Forex Correlations to Crude Oil Weaken, S&amp;P 500 Link Strengthens By David Rodriguez, Quantitative Strategist 01 March 2011 17:55 GMT Currency trading correlations to Crude Oil prices have broken down through recent energy price rallies, but a significant strengthening in the NYMEX WTI contract’s correlation to the S&amp;P 500 underlines market sensitivity to geopolitical tensions. Crude oil prices have rallied sharply to multi-year highs as previous and ongoing tensions in the Middle East threaten supplies from several important oil-producing countries. Said moves have not consistently translated into currency rate moves—at least not as far as traditional correlations are concerned. In fact, the short-term link between the US Dollar/Canadian Dollar currency pair has weakened considerably through recent moves. The NYMEX WTI contract seems strongly correlated to the S&amp;P 500. Such a link emphasizes that geopolitical tensions may continue to move markets through upcoming trade. Forex Correlations Summary Forex correlations against Oil, Gold, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the past 30 calendar days: http://media.dailyfx.com/illustratio..._Picture_3.png Read a guide on understanding the forex correlations summary chart . US Dollar/Canadian Dollar and NYMEX WTI Crude Oil Contract http://media.dailyfx.com/illustratio..._Picture_4.png The correlation between the Canadian Dollar and Crude Oil prices has all but broken down through recent trade, in fact turning positive on a very short-term basis. Said moves suggest that the USDCAD has mostly lost its luster as a proxy for oil price speculation. The fact that recent COT data shows Non Commercial Traders very heavily net-long the Canadian Dollar against its US namesake warns against taking aggressive short positions through upcoming trade. US Dollar Index and NYMEX WTI Crude Oil Contract http://media.dailyfx.com/illustratio..._Picture_5.png The US Dollar Index has likewise most lost its close link to oil prices. The Greenback had previously been negatively correlated to moves in oil futures, but the recent surge in oil prices has not necessarily translated into commensurate USD tumbles. The weakened link suggests that the US Dollar is largely disconnected to recent moves in commodity markets. Dollar declines instead seem a function of a longer-standing downtrend and not necessarily linked to other markets. US S&amp;P 500 and NYMEX WTI Crude Oil Contract http://media.dailyfx.com/illustratio..._Picture_6.png The S&amp;P 500 is the one of the few assets that has seen its correlation to Crude Oil prices strengthen considerably through recent trade. The index has fallen noticeably on surges in oil prices, and recent trends suggest it is likely to continue doing so amidst global geopolitical tensions. This is a noteworthy departure from just months ago when both asset prices were driven higher by financial market risk sentiment. Oil is now moving like a safe-haven asset on considerable uncertainty in the Middle East.

Forex Correlations: Australian Dollar Proxy for S&amp;P 500, Gold, Oil Prices SymbolPriceChange AUDUSD=X 1.0713-0.0029 http://chart.finance.yahoo.com/instr...n-US&amp;region=US David Rodriguez, On Tuesday May 17, 2011, 12:23 pm EDT The Australian Dollar remains a speculator’s favorite, serving as a highly-correlated and high-yielding proxy to the US S&amp;P 500, Gold, and Crude Oil futures prices. The Australian Dollar has pulled back from record highs against its US namesake as broader financial markets correct. Yet the antipodean currency remains an attractive investment as its short-term yields are the highest among G10 currency and the US Dollar currently ‘boasts’ record-low interest rates. As long as US Dollar yields remain near record-lows, we may continue to see cross-market correlations trade near historical strength across a broad range of raw materials prices. This seems particularly true for high-flying Gold and Crude Oil prices as well as the Australian Dollar. Forex Correlations Summary Forex correlations against Oil, Gold, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the past 30 calendar days: http://media.dailyfx.com/illustratio..._Picture_3.png Read a guide on understanding the forex correlations summary chart . Australian Dollar and US S&amp;P 500 Index http://media.dailyfx.com/illustratio..._Picture_4.png The Australian Dollar’s link to the US S&amp;P 500 currently trades near record-strength, as the high-yielding currency remains strongly correlated to broader risk sentiment. With the highest yield of any G10 currency, the Aussie Dollar is an investment destination of choice for those seeking high returns. A common strategy is to borrow low-yielding currencies such as the US Dollar and Japanese Yen and collect the much stronger yields available in the AUD. Yet this strategy only works if yield differentials are large enough to cover potential exchange rate volatility. The net result is to leave the Australian Dollar to risk sentiment and broader moves in financial markets. The Aussie$ is subsequently a strong proxy for trading the S&amp;P 500 with the additional benefit of high yields, and positioning data suggests traders have been taking advantage of said dynamic through recent trade. Australian Dollar and Gold Prices http://media.dailyfx.com/illustratio..._Picture_5.png The Australian Dollar’s link to gold prices recently trades near record strength, making it difficult to tell an AUDUSD chart apart from the equivalent gold price chart. Fast rallies in both the Aussie currency and precious metals prices have attracted speculative interest across the board. In fact many prefer the AUDUSD to holding spot gold or gold futures due to the fact that the forex position offers the additional benefit of yield differentials. The Australian Dollar remains inextricably linked to gold prices as speculators have piled into the currency as a high-yielding proxy to bets on gold itself. The level of leverage in both FX and gold futures markets nonetheless leaves both instruments quite sensitive to moves in broader risk sentiment. Though gold has historically been seen and traded as a safe-haven in times of market stress, it has recently sold off in tandem with the S&amp;P 500 and broader ‘risk’. Cross-market correlations remain as strong as ever. Australian Dollar/US Dollar and NYMEX WTI Crude Oil Prices http://media.dailyfx.com/illustratio..._Picture_6.png The Australian Dollar’s link to Crude Oil prices has almost literally never been stronger. The ‘Commodity Bloc’ currency previously hit fresh record-highs amidst impressive strength in raw materials prices. And though Gold is typically the more traditional commodity link to the AUD, its short-term correlation is actually equal to that of Crude Oil. A resumption of US Dollar rallies would keep this link quite strong. Unlike in Gold or Oil markets, there is no carrying cost in holding AUD-long positions. In fact the additional benefit of high interest rates is what makes it a favorite among speculators bullish of commodity markets.

How To Trade Currency And Commodity Correlations Posted: Dec 15, 2010 Correlations between the world's most heavily traded commodities and currency pairs are common. For example, the Canadian dollar (CAD) is correlated to oil prices due to exporting, while Japan is susceptible to oil prices because it imports most of its oil. Similarly, Australia (AUD) and New Zealand (NZD) have a close relationship to gold prices and oil prices. While the correlations (positive or negative) can be significant, if forex traders want to profit from them, it's important to time a "correlation trade" properly. There will be times when a relationship breaks down, and such times can be very costly for a trader who does not understand what is occurring. Being aware of a correlation, monitoring it and timing it are crucial to successful trading based on the inter-market analysis provided by examining currency and commodity relationships. Tutorial: Forex Trading Deciding Which Currency and Commodity Relationships to Trade Not all currency/commodity correlations are worth trading. Traders need to take into account commissions and spreads , additional fees, liquidity and also access to information. Currencies and commodities that are heavily traded will be easier to find information on, will have smaller spreads and liquidity that is more likely to be adequate. Canada is a major exporter of oil, and thus its economy is affected by the price of oil and the amount it can export. Japan is a major importer of oil, and thus the price of oil and the amount it must import affects the Japanese economy. Because of the major effect oil has on Canada and Japan, the CAD/JPY positively correlates with oil prices. This pair can be monitored as well as the USD/CAD. The downside is that the CAD/JPY generally has a higher spread and is less liquid than the USD/CAD. Since oil is priced in U.S. dollars throughout most of the world, the fluctuating dollar impacts oil prices (and vice versa). Therefore the USD/CAD can also be watched given that the two countries are major oil importers and exporters. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...Commodity1.gif Figure 1: CAD/JPY versus adjusted oil prices. Chart shows weekly data for 2007 through 2010. Source: TD Ameritrade Figure 1 shows that there are times when the currency pair and oil diverged . The oil prices are adjusted. Figure 2 uses unadjusted oil prices and, through 2010, a strong correlation can be seen showing it is important to monitor correlation in real-time with actual trade data. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...Commodity2.gif Figure 2: CAD/JPY versus unadjusted oil futures (percentage terms). YTD (2010), daily. Source: TD Ameritrade. Australia is one of the major gold producers in the world. As a result, its economy is impacted by the price of gold and how much it can export. New Zealand is a major trading partner with Australia and is thus highly susceptible to fluctuations in Australia's economy. This means that New Zealand is also highly affected by Australia's relation to gold. In 2008, Australia was the fourth-largest gold producer in the world. In 2009, the U.S. was the third-largest buyer of gold. Therefore, the AUD/USD and NZD/USD are suitable for trading in relation to gold prices. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...Commodity3.gif Figure 3: AUD/USD versus adjusted gold futures (percentage). Chart shows weekly data for 2007 through 2010. Source: TD Ameritrade While Australia was among the smaller volume oil exporters in 2009, throughout 2010 the AUD/USD was also positively correlated to oil prices, and then in September diverged. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...Commodity4.gif Figure 4: AUD/USD versus unadjusted oil futures (percentage). YTD (2010), Daily. Source: TD Ameritrade Currency commodity relationships may change over time. Other currency commodity relationships can be found by looking for major producers of any export, as well as the major importers of the same commodity. The currency cross rate between the exporter and importer is worth looking at for a correlation with the commodity. Deciding Which Instrument to Trade In Upon knowing which currencies and commodities have strong relationships, traders need to decide which tradable currency pair they will make their trades in, or if they will trade in the commodity and currency. This will depend on several factors including fees and the trader's ability to access a given market. The charts show that the commodity is often the more volatile of the instruments. If accessible, a trader may be able to trade the commodity and currency pair from one account due to the widespread use of commodity contracts for difference (CFDs). (See How To Invest In Commodities for more on this topic) Monitoring the Correlation for "Cracks" It is also crucial to point out that just because a relationships exists "on average" over time, does not mean that strong correlations exists at all times. While these currency pairs are worth watching for their high correlation tendencies towards a commodity, there will be times when the strong correlation does not exist and may even reverse for some time. A commodity and currency pair that is highly positively correlated one year, may diverge and become negatively correlated in the next. Traders who venture into correlation trading should be aware of when a correlation is strong and when it is shifting. Monitoring correlations can be done quite easily with modern trading platforms. A correlation indicator can be used to show the real-time correlation between a commodity and a currency pair over a given period. A trader may wish to capture small divergences while the two instruments remain highly correlated overall. When divergence continues and the correlation weakens, a trader needs to step back and understand that this correlation may be in a period of deterioration; it is time to step to the sidelines or take a different trading approach to accommodate the changing market. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...Commodity5.gif Figure 5: CAD/JPY versus oil futures and correlation indicator. Chart shows weekly data for 2008 through 2010. Source: TD Ameritrade Figure 5 shows the weekly CAD/JPY as well as the correlation indicator (15 periods) comparing it to oil futures. Much of the time the indicator shows a strong correlation in the 0.80 area, yet there are times when the correlation falls off. When the indicator falls below a certain threshold (for example 0.50), the correlation is not strong and the trader can wait for the currency and commodity to re-establish the strong correlation. Divergences can be used for trade signals, but it should be noted that divergences can last for long periods of time. The correlation indicator can be adjusted for the time frame a trader is trading on. A longer calculation period will smooth out the results and is better for longer term traders. Shortening the calculation period will make the indicator choppier but may also provide short-term signals and allow for correlation trading on smaller time frames. (For additional information, see Divergence: The Trade Most Profitable . )

Follow-up: Timing the Currency/Commodity Trade Upon looking at the prior charts it is apparent that timing and a strategy is needed for navigating the fluctuating correlations between currencies and commodities. While exact entry and exit will be determined by the trader and will depend on whether they are trading the commodity, currency or both, a trader should be aware of several things when entering and exiting correlation trades. Are the currency and commodity currently correlated? How about over time? Does one asset seem to lead the other? Is price diverging? Is one asset class making higher highs, for example, while the other asset class fails to make higher highs? If this is the case, wait for the two to begin moving together once again. Use a trend confirmation tool. If divergences occurs, wait for a trend to emerge (or reversal) where the currency and commodity trend in their appropriate correlated fashion. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/articl...Commodity6.gif Figure 6: USD/CAD versus Oil CFD Source: CFD Trading By monitoring correlations several trades could have been confirmed in the USD/CAD and oil markets over the time frame shown in Figure 6. While one could trade the pairs during correlated times, this particular time frame saw several divergences. As the currency and commodity realigned themselves, large trends developed. By watching for breaks in trend lines in both the commodity and currency, or by waiting for one asset class to join the correlation trend of the other asset class (marked by blue arrows), several large trends could have been captured. This is similar to watching for divergences in the correlation indicator and then taking a trade in a trending direction as the commodity and currency realign. The commodity, currency or both could be traded. The Bottom Line on Trading Currency and Commodity Correlations Correlations between currencies and commodities are not an exact science. Often correlations break down and may even reverse for extended periods. Traders must remain vigilant in monitoring correlations for opportunities. Correlation indicators or monitoring charts are two ways of completing this task. After divergences, waiting for the commodity and currency to align in their respective trends can be a powerful signal - yet traders must accept that divergences can last a long time. Relationships may change over time as countries alter exports or imports, and this will affect correlations. It is also important that traders determine how they will make trades, whether in the currency, the commodity or both.

I could take the EURNOK Long since I was with much more EURUSD Short. It's also a combination of all currency pairs together wither I vote for a EURNOK Long with regards of these actual parameters at the daily and weekly frame. Monthly: Indifferent candles the last four ones. Weekly: Range Trading (Indifferent Candles) Daily: CCI-Divergence, Stochastic-Divergence, Resistance Line Hope it helps! Best regards FXcube

Scan the crucical pivots with higher profit chances. GBPUSD, H1, 2011 July 06 GBPUSD, H4, 2011 July 06 H4: Multiplex use several different moving averages at once, but they offer different pieces of the puzzle when planning our trades. When the market is steadily rolling along (here downside) moving averages keep us in our trades, but if something changes, such as a moving average crossover, we'll likely get out or trade the new direction. When moving averages do cross (H4 1) you should take notice. If the fast EMA crosses below the slow EMA it likely confirms new downward price action. However such crosses should not prompt you to place a trade, as it often occurs too late and will put you in the market an unfavorable risk/reward ratio.

GBPUSD, H1, 2011 July 06 Range Bound Trading with the Upper and Lower Bands of the Bollinger Band &amp; the Stochastics You could also trade the ups and downs at upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands in combination with the Stochastics Tops &amp; Bottoms also at lower time frames and may be with some confirmation anchor e.g. the Price actions ( engulfin patterns, Shooting Star, Hammer, Inside Bar,...). This trading action could content a higher risk and depends at your risk tolerance. I like these market situations just as well. That's what gives it that extra something. You could often monitore this market situation (e.g. a Range at lower Time Frames) in an environment where important Price Levels (e.g. resistance, support lines) at higher time frames were reached by the market.

Breakout Trading This you could do throughout all of time (M1, M5, M15. M30, H1, H4, Daily, Weekly, Monthly) and over the currency hills (all currency pairs) and far away (commodities). GBPUSD, H1, 2011 July 06 When currency prices break out of certain price levels, a large sustained move in the direction of the breakout may occur, giving rise to a situation whereby big profits could potentially be captured in the least amount of time. The main problem with trading breakouts is that many of these breakout attempts fail. (At another occasion I could walk you through several guidelines of how you can better identify potential breakouts opportunities for this strategy). Draw some Support and Resistance Lines and trade the run down in combination with the Stochastic (Tops &amp; Bottoms) and with the Divergence if there're ones. The second isochromatic Heikin Ashi candle could be a confirmation afterwards.

GBPUSD, H4, 2011 July 07 Long @ 1.6013 Not the best entry concerning M30 &amp; H1 (Stochastic Top) but MACD seems running to the zero line upwards with isochromatic Heikin Ashis (two green bars). Target @ 1.6116 mR2 Daily Stochastic hasn't reached the bottom. Enter Long again at DS1 1.5915 Be aware: Monthly is moving between the EMA21 and EMA14 Line. Weekly:If EMA55 will broken down by the weekly candle and would closed at the counterpart side further downside movements seems to be possible.

The more factors influence the behavior of a currency pair, the more difficult it is to evaluate its behavior and make up future forecasts. Therefore, if we managed to extract components of a currency pair, values of a national currency that change with the time, we could considerably delimit the freedom of national currency movement as compared to the currency pair with this currency, as well as the number of factors influencing its behavior. As a result we would increase the accuracy of its behavior estimation and future forecasting. How can we do that? Link: http://articles.mql4.com/821

Multile Time Frame Analysis Example EURUSD, Daily, 2011 July 07 It make no sense trade at one timeframe and analyse only one time frame. I intend to use the Multiple Time Frame Analysis in my experienced trading style. It takes a little longer but often I will get more qualified information. If you take a look at the daily chart you could see a classicer of daily price movements. (1) The Market price goes down over the middle line of the Bollinger Band with all the power of the highest CCI and the Stochastics values before. (2) Retracement: A revearsal in the movement of the currency price, countering the prevailing trend. The market price turns back to the middle line of Bollinger Band and to the cutline of all EMA's. (3) ... , and now we don't know where the market price will go on, but extremely often when Daily looks in this way like in the the frame below I could bet that the next price movement is going down again (3). We don't know! We'll see. The Fibonacci retracement tool is favored by many traders because of its abilty to identify a price level that a correction may reach before it is able to reverse and continue in the direction of the original trend. Daily seems for me like a range and the biottom line isn't touched since yet. So the market need its breathe for his ups and downs. May be I take one more Short later. Otherwise I have to hedge my open positions. I like this kind of trading of rational expectations to go in the market ahead of schudule before the market could turn in my way. Why? May be it's burning ambition at an advanced level trader. I don't know! See also # 89 , # 90 .

So before you trade at a time frame (e.g M5), why not take a look at the other time cells (e.g. M15, M30, H1, H4, Daily) for getting a more round picture to earn a better chance? Time Cycling

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Multiple Time Frame Trade Example EURUSD, M1, 2011 July 07 In some sense you could also trade the M1. To break the higher time cells down into the smallest time cells. At the Exit Point you have to go out when trading the M1 (may be you could stay any longer with your short at M15 or M30).

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Multiple Time Frame Trade Example EURUSD, H1, 2011 July 07 Stochastic High, CCI High, Market Price is struggling at the EMA55-Line. ...and if you trade the H1 you could go Short now at 1.4360 or wait for a false breakout (~1.4378). Then the Resistance Line (EMA55) won't be broken definitely. May be with setting a Stop Loss 30 points above the EMA55 Line.

Trade Example How to read the EMA-Lines. AUDCHF, H1, 2011 July 07 Moving averages are frequently used as price filters. To filter choppy price action into a more reliable indication for true price action, a short-term moving average has to cross a longer-term moving average. Short-term EMAs (fast) are more sensitive to price changes because they are measuring fewer candles. Conversely, longer term EMAs (slow) tend to be more flat and are less likely to whipsaw up and down. A simple use of moving averages is using them to gauge the speed and direction of the trend. If prices are held by the EMA21 the trend could be considered strong. If prices break the EMA21 you should become more cautious. This could be a sign or a reversal or a consolidating market. In forex trading the first thing you need to do is define two things, the speed of the market and the momentum of price. Speed is how the market is moving. Momentum is where price is going. Start your market analysis with speed. How is the market moving today? Is it range bound or is it trending? A market will maintain its speed until something fundamentally changes market bias. Speed is a measurement of the market. To measure speed use medium term moving averages. For instance, you can use a combination of exponential moving averages (EMAs) such as 21/55; 20/60; 34/89. Whatever seems to work for you is fine. Based on the angle and separation between these two moving averages you will be able to define the speed of the market. EMA 5/13/21/55 A steep angle and large separation will indicate a fast moving and trending market. A shallow angle and narrow separation will indicate a slow moving and ranging market. Steep angle and wide separation indicate a fast moving market that is trending. Why is this knowlwedge important? Two reasons: (1) You can choose the right tools for the job. (2) You can adjust your risk tolerance.

Channel Trading with the Bollinger Bands &amp; the CCI Tops &amp; Bottoms. Numerous systems abound for interpreting the width of the Bollinger Bands (the distance between the upper and lower bands) to predict price movement. I would like to share a unique interpretation of the bands that works particularly well with trading the forex. When the slope of the bands is minimal, in other words, when the upper and lower bands flatten it predicts a reversal as price touches and retreats from the flat band. Note that at 7 July 6:15 the lower Bollinger Band has flattened. Price repeatedly touched this flat lower band over several quarter-hour periods till 8 July 4:15 GMT+1 near the price of 1.5966-1.5955 (mS1). The upper Bollinger Band flattened on the GBPUSD M15 chart during the same time which predicted a powerful movement away from the upper band near the price of 1.6008 (DR1) - 1.5976 down to the lower band seen in Illustration below. There is something for every forex trader using this technique from the scalper seeking to capture numerous 5 pip moves in a day to the position trader playing for several hundred pip moves over the course of several weeks. Feel free to apply the CCI(14) and/or the Stochastics with the upper and lower Bollinger Band by Channel Trading. GBPUSD, M15, 2011 July 08

Bollinger Bands ... Let's compare trading to building a house. You wouldn't use a hammer on a screw, right? Nor would you use a buzz saw to drive in nails. There's a proper tool for each situation. Just like in trading, some trading tools and indicators are best used in particular environments or situations. So, the more tools you have, the better you can adapt to the ever changing market environment. Or if you want to focus on a few specific trading environments or tools, that's cool too. It's good to have a specialist when installing your electricity or plumbing in a house, just like it's cool to be a Bollinger band or Moving Average expert. There are a million different ways to grab some pips! For this lesson, as you learn about these indicators, think of each as a new tool that you can add to that toolbox of yours. You might not necessarily use all of these tools, but it's always nice to have plenty of options, right? You might even find one that you understand and comfortable enough to master on its own. Now, enough about tools already! Let's get started! Bollinger Bands Bollinger bands are used to measure a market's volatility. Basically, this little tool tells us whether the market is quiet or whether the market is LOUD ! When the market is quiet, the bands contract and when the market is LOUD , the bands expand. Notice on the chart below that when price is quiet, the bands are close together. When price moves up, the bands spread apart. http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...inger-band.png That's all there is to it. Yes, we could go on and bore you by going into the history of the Bollinger band, how it is calculated, the mathematical formulas behind it, and so on and so forth, but we really didn't feel like typing it all out. In all honesty, you don't need to know any of that junk. We think it's more important that we show you some ways you can apply the Bollinger bands to your trading. Note: If you really want to learn about the calculations of a Bollinger band, then you can go to www.bollingerbands.com . The Bollinger Bounce One thing you should know about Bollinger bands is that price tends to return to the middle of the bands. That is the whole idea behind the Bollinger bounce. By looking at the chart below, can you tell us where the price might go next? http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...ance-start.png If you said down, then you are correct! As you can see, the price settled back down towards the middle area of the bands. http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...stance-end.png What you just saw was a classic Bollinger bounce. The reason these bounces occur is because Bollinger bands act like dynamic support and resistance levels. The longer the time frame you are in, the stronger these bands tend to be. Many traders have developed systems that thrive on these bounces and this strategy is best used when the market is ranging and there is no clear trend. Now let's look at a way to use Bollinger bands when the market does trend. Bollinger Squeeze The Bollinger squeeze is pretty self-explanatory. When the bands squeeze together, it usually means that a breakout is getting ready to happen. If the candles start to break out above the top band, then the move will usually continue to go up. If the candles start to break out below the lower band, then price will usually continue to go down. http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...eeze-start.png Looking at the chart above, you can see the bands squeezing together. The price has just started to break out of the top band. Based on this information, where do you think the price will go? http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...queeze-end.png If you said up, you are correct again! This is how a typical Bollinger squeeze works. This strategy is designed for you to catch a move as early as possible. Setups like these don't occur every day, but you can probably spot them a few times a week if you are looking at a 15-minute chart. There are many other things you can do with Bollinger bands, but these are the 2 most common strategies associated with them. It's time to put this in your trader's toolbox before we move on to the next indicator.

Weekly Trading Lesson: Bollinger Bands http://www.actionforex.com/images/st...20080409w1.gif One of the more popular technical indicators in use today is Bollinger Bands. Created by John Bollinger in the early 1980s, this tool is essentially a Moving Average with a volatility filter. Volatility can be of great value in an indicator for those times when the market is swinging wildly between the lows and the highs as a result of some news event. If the average swing for a currency pair is 50 pips in a quiet market, but expands to 100 pips in a volatile market, a trader has to adjust their approach to account for the bigger swings. After all, a 50 pip stop is different in a quiet market than it is in a volatile market. What makes Bollinger Bands different is that the distance between the bands is designed to widen when the market becomes volatile and tighten when the market is quiet. When using this tool to find a trade, the first step is to identify the direction of the trend on the daily chart. If the daily trend is up, we want to look for buys only and if the daily trend is down, we want to look for sells. So if the market is in a downtrend, we should look to sell on a test of the upper Bollinger Band and if the market is in an uptrend, then we should look to buy on a test of the lower Bollinger Band. That entry price level will move further away from the market in volatile times, giving you a better entry that is adjusted to the current situation rather than past activity. http://www.actionforex.com/articles-...2008040841611/

Guidelines for Using Bollinger Bands for Forex Trading By John Bollinger, CFA, CMT Bollinger Bands are widely and successfully used by forex traders worldwide. One of the great joys of having invented an analytical technique such as Bollinger Bands is seeing what other people do with it. While there are many ways to use Bollinger Bands in the forex market, following are a few rules that serve as a good beginning point. Bollinger Bands provide a relative definition of high and low. By definition price is high at the upper band and low at the lower band. That relative definition can be used to compare price action and indicator action to arrive at rigorous buy and sell decisions. Appropriate indicators can be derived from momentum, volume, sentiment, open interest, inter-market data, etc. If more than one indicator is used the indicators should not be directly related to one another. For example, a momentum indicator might complement a volume indicator successfully, but two momentum indicators aren't better than one. Bollinger Bands can be used in pattern recognition to define/clarify pure price patterns such as "M" tops and "W" bottoms, momentum shifts, etc. . Tags of the bands are just that, tags not signals. A tag of the upper Bollinger Band is NOT in-and-of-itself a sell signal. A tag of the lower Bollinger Band is NOT in-and-of-itself a buy signal. In trending markets price can, and does, walk up the upper Bollinger Band and down the lower Bollinger Band. Closes outside the Bollinger Bands are initially continuation signals, not reversal signals. (This has been the basis for many successful volatility breakout systems.) The default parameters of 20 periods for the moving average and standard deviation calculations, and two standard deviations for the width of the bands are just that, defaults. The actual parameters needed for any given market/task may be different. The average deployed as the middle Bollinger Band should not be the best one for crossovers. Rather, it should be descriptive of the intermediate-term trend. For consistent price containment: If the average is lengthened the number of standard deviations needs to be increased; from 2 at 20 periods, to 2.1 at 50 periods. Likewise, if the average is shortened the number of standard deviations should be reduced; from 2 at 20 periods, to 1.9 at 10 periods. Traditional Bollinger Bands are based upon a simple moving average. This is because a simple average is used in the standard deviation calculation and we wish to be logically consistent. Exponential Bollinger Bands eliminate sudden changes in the width of the bands caused by large price changes exiting the back of the calculation window. Exponential averages must be used for BOTH the middle band and in the calculation of standard deviation. Make no statistical assumptions based on the use of the standard deviation calculation in the construction of the bands. The distribution of security prices is non-normal and the typical sample size in most deployments of Bollinger Bands is too small for statistical significance. (In practice we typically find 90%, not 95%, of the data inside Bollinger Bands with the default parameters) %b tells us where we are in relation to the Bollinger Bands. The position within the bands is calculated using an adaptation of the formula for Stochastics %b has many uses; among the more important are identification of divergences, pattern recognition and the coding of trading systems using Bollinger Bands. Indicators can be normalized with %b, eliminating fixed thresholds in the process. To do this plot 50-period or longer Bollinger Bands on an indicator and then calculate %b of the indicator. BandWidth tells us how wide the Bollinger Bands are. The raw width is normalized using the middle band. Using the default parameters BandWidth is four times the coefficient of variation. BandWidth has many uses. Its most popular use is to indentify "The Squeeze", but is also useful in identifying trend changes... Bollinger Bands can be used on most financial time series, including equities, indices, foreign exchange, commodities, futures, options and bonds. Bollinger Bands can be used on bars of any length, 5 minutes, one hour, daily, weekly, etc. The key is that the bars must contain enough activity to give a robust picture of the price-formation mechanism at work. Bollinger Bands do not provide continuous advice; rather they help indentify setups where the odds may be in your favor. Good Trading, John Bollinger, CFA,CMT http://www.bbforex.com/tutorial/?p=6

Fading breakouts refers to trading against breakouts, when you believe that the currency prices will not be able to sustain a follow-through action in the direction of the breakout. We fade breakouts when we expect breakouts tend to fail at the first few attempts and that makes fading breakouts an excellent short-term strategy for forex traders. Fading breakouts tends to be more effective as a short-term strategy and is not meant for the long-term. False breakouts also known as fakeouts are a bane for breakouts traders but boon for breakout faders.

How to Fade False Breakouts With the Boomerang Strategy By Ed Ponsi | Forex traders can use "The Boomerang" strategy to fade false breakouts. Most forex trading strategies are based on a market tendency. For example, the currency markets have a tendency to form strong trends, and many trading techniques seek to capitalize on this trait. Other strategies are based on breakouts from an opening range, which are likely to occur during times of high volume and liquidity. One area that has been neglected is the tendency for the currency markets to drift quietly at certain times of the trading day. This begs the question, is it possible to use this less obvious market tendency to our advantage? After the U.S. forex trading session ends, and prior to the beginning of the Asian trading session, there is a stretch of several hours during which the overall volume is normally low. This illiquid time of day occurs around 5 p.m. New York time. While it is true that traders from Australia and New Zealand are active at this time of day, the big three centers of world currency trading, Great Britain, the United States, and Japan -- lie mostly dormant. It is during these hours that many currency pairs tend to drift aimlessly, and the low volume environment renders any movement, especially a breakout, highly suspect. What is the Boomerang Strategy? Why are breakouts that occur on low volume considered unreliable? In all forms of trading, a breakout that occurs on high volume is respected because when traders are willing to put real money into a trading vehicle such as a stock, commodity, or currency, it shows a high level of commitment to that position. The increase in volume is a reflection of that commitment. While the currency markets are far too vast to allow for the collection of exact volume figures, it is understood that volume normally increases or decreases at certain times of the trading day. Therefore, breakouts that occur during times that are known to be liquid are more reliable, and those that take place during times of illiquidity are much less dependable. Since any movement that occurs at this time (5 p.m. New York time) is unreliable and likely to retrace, we can create a strategy that is designed to capitalize on these false breakouts, by 'fading' or trading against them. The Concept Since 5 p.m. Eastern time is considered by many to be the beginning of the forex trading day, it is also the time that many market makers have chosen to charge or collect interest. We need to take this fact into consideration, because currency traders who pay no attention to interest charges and credits might be surprised at the amount they are paying, while those who do focus on this aspect of trading are often area able to use interest credits to their advantage. In order to avoid interest rate charges, orders should be entered just after 5 p.m. Eastern time when using this strategy. This will equate to 22:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which is the standard measurement of time used by currency traders. It is important to note that GMT does not recognize Daylight Saving Time, which is known as "Summer Hours" in the U.K. Therefore, the time of day for order entry for this strategy will be 21:00 GMT when Daylight Saving Time or Summer Hours are being observed. Why do forex traders use Greenwich Mean Time as a reference point? Imagine that you are in the western United States, on a conference call with several traders located in London, New York, and Singapore. One participant mentions that important news is expected to hit the wire at 10 am. This can create confusion, because you may not know which participant made the comment, or where that person is located. Therefore, you would not know if that person was referring to noon in London, noon in Singapore, or noon in New York. However, if a one of the participants states that important news is due to come out at noon GMT, there can be no misunderstanding about the intended meaning. All of the traders on the conference call will be prepared for possible short-term market volatility at the time of the news release. The specific trading vehicle designated for this strategy is the Euro/ U.S. Dollar currency pair. EUR/USD is attractive for short term trading strategies because it has a tight spread. When dealing with short-term strategies, every pip matters and a slightly wider spread can mean the difference between success and failure. For this reason, trading platforms that feature variable spreads may be problematic, because spreads tend to widen during illiquid times of day. Since the strategy is implemented at a time of low liquidity, a fixed-spread platform is recommended when using this strategy. The Setup The plan entails the simultaneous entry of a sell order above the market and a buy order below the market. The purpose of the sell order is to 'fade', or trade against, a move higher and the buy order is entered to fade, or trade against, a downward move. In either case, the trader assumes that any directional movement will be short lived since there is unlikely to be much volume behind it. The short-term movement is most likely caused by an order or group of orders that would not have the power to move the market under normal circumstances. Such orders can and often do move the market when trading conditions are 'thin'. This movement should be followed by a retracement of the exchange rate, and it is this retracement that the trader seeks to capture. The sell order will be located 15 pips above the 'opening price', and the buy order will be 15 pips below the opening price. Since this strategy is only designed for the EUR/USD currency pair, fixed-pip parameters can be used. If other currency pairs were eligible for use in this strategy, it would be impossible to use fixed parameters because of differences in volatility and in the spread among the various pairs. For our purposes, the opening price will be the price indicated at 5 pm Eastern time, as described earlier. The protective stop for the buy order and for the sell order will be 15 pips away from the entry point, which creates a risk-reward ratio of 1-to-1 (one pip of risk per one pip of reward) for this trade. This is a brief 'slingshot' style of trade that is designed to capture a quick profit and is intended for use at one specific time of day only. If no orders have executed within two hours after the open, all open orders must be canceled. The reason why the orders must be canceled at this time is because Asian trading markets tend to become active around 19:00 Eastern time, and as a result an increase in volume and volatility should be expected. Since the strategy is designed for use in a low-volume trading environment, the increased activity from traders in Tokyo, Hong Kong, and other Asian market centers will create a trading environment that is too liquid for this particular strategy. When this additional liquidity enters the market, any movement in currencies is more likely to have real volume behind it, and therefore may not retrace. A strategy that fades breakouts would be inappropriate under these circumstances, since there is a chance that institutions or other large traders may be committed to the move. This method of trading is simple but effective, because exchange rates rarely make big moves during the 'dead zone' between the U.S. and Asian sessions. In order for the protective stop to be reached, the exchange rate for the EUR/USD pair would have to move 30 pips in one direction - 15 pips to trigger the entry, plus 15 more pips to trigger the stop - a move which would be rare at this illiquid, non-volatile time of day. Rules for Entering The Trade Let's take a look at the strategy in action using the five-minute chart. On February 26, 2008, the EUR/USD pair opens at 1.4991. The trader places a sell order 15 pips above, at 1.5006, with a stop at 1.5021, and a buy order 15 pips below, at 1.4976 with a stop at 1.4961. Within 25 minutes, the exchange rate rises to 1.5012, easily executing the sell order at 1.5006. The trader cancels the buy order, but leaves the stop in place at 1.5021. The target is the "opening price" of 1.4991, which is reached within 30 minutes of the entry (see figure 1). http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/EK/3-6/chart1.gif Figure 1: EUR/USD pops up to the entry point, then quickly fades back. Source: FXtrek IntelliChart, Copyright 2001-2008 Fxtrek.com, Inc. On August 5, 2007, the EUR/USD currency pair 'opens' at 1.3510. Immediately, two entry orders are placed, a buy order at 1.3495 with a stop located at 1.3480, and a sell order at 1.3525 with a stop positioned at 1.3540. Just two candles later, the exchange rate quickly dips to 1.3789, easily executing our buy order at 1.3595. The trader immediately cancels the sell order, but keeps the protective stop in place at 1.3480. The exchange rate immediately bounces back toward our entry point, and several candles later, at 17:45 Eastern time, the pair has climbed as high at 1.3819, easily executing our exit order at 1.3810. The entire duration of the trade was just 35 minutes. The pair continued to rise after the exit point was achieved (see figure 2). http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/EK/3-6/chart2.gif Figure 2: EUR/USD quickly reaches the entry point, then bounces higher. Source: FXtrek IntelliChart, Copyright 2001-2008 Fxtrek.com, Inc. Here is another example; on May 10th, 2007, the EUR/USD currency pair opened at 1.3487 at 17:00 Eastern time. The trader places a buy order at 1.3472, with a stop 15 pips below at 1.3457. The trader also places a sell order at 1.3502, with a stop 15 pips higher at 1.3517. Just under an hour later, at 17:50 Eastern time, the exchange rate dips to 1.3471, creating an entry. At this time, the trader cancels the sell order, but the protective stop at 1.3457 remains in place. At 19:15 Eastern time, two hours and fifteen minutes after the original orders were placed, the exchange rate for EUR/USD climbs to 1.3489, allowing the exit order to execute (see figure 3). http://images.tradingmarkets.com/2008/EK/3-6/chart3.gif Figure 3: Five-minute chart of EUR/USD on 5/10/07 shows the open, entry, and exit. Source: FXtrek IntelliChart, Copyright 2001-2008 Fxtrek.com, Inc. This tactic can make a nice addition to a trader's arsenal of techniques; it is intended for those 'quiet times' when trading opportunities are rare. The intention is to get in and get out quickly, and while the gains are not particularly large, the percentage of winning trades should be high because of the market's tendency to drift at this time of day. One more important point to consider - this strategy assumes that interest will be charged or credited at a particular time of day. While many market makers charge or credit interest at 17:00 Eastern time (5 pm), this is not a uniform practice. Rules for the payment or collection of interest vary from on market maker to another, so be sure to check with your broker for these important details before attempting to place a trade using this strategy. http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/...les/-75514.cfm

Fade the Breakout Fade the breakout you say? Was that just a typo? Did you mean to say, "trade the breakout"? Nope! Fading breakouts simply means trading in the opposite direction of the breakout. Fading breakouts = trading false breakouts. You would fade a breakout if you believe that a breakout from a support or resistance level is false and unable to keep moving in the same direction. In cases in which the support or resistance level broken is significant, fading breakouts may prove to be smarter than trading the breakout. Keep in mind that fading breakouts is a great short-term strategy. Breakouts tend to fail at the first few attempts but may succeed eventually. REPEAT: Fading breakouts is a great short-term strategy. It is not a great one to use for longer term traders. By learning trade false breakouts, also known as fakeouts, you can avoid getting whipsawed. Trading breakouts appeal to many independent traders. Why? Support and resistance levels are supposed to be price floors and ceilings. If these levels are broken, one would expect for price to continue in the same direction as the breakage. If a support level is broken, that means that the general price movement is downwards and people are more likely to sell than buy. Conversely, if a resistance level is broken, then the crowd believes that price is more likely to rally even higher and will tend to buy rather than sell. Independent retail traders have greedy mentalities. They believe in trading in the direction of the breakout. They believe in huge gains on huge moves. Catch the big fish, forget the small fries. In a perfect world, this would be true. But the world is not perfect. Frogs and princesses do not live happily ever after. What does in fact happen is that most breakouts FAIL. Breakouts fail simply because the smart minority has to make money off the majority. Don't feel so bad. The smart minority tends to be comprised of the big players with huge accounts and buy/sell orders. In order to sell something, there must be a buyer. However, if everyone wants to buy above a resistance level or sell below a support level, the market maker has to take the other side of the equation. And let us warn you: the market maker ain't no fool. http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...13/no-fool.png Retail traders like to trade breakouts. The smart minority, the institutional, more seasoned traders, prefer to fade breakouts. The smarter traders take advantage of the collective thinking of the crowd or inexperienced traders and win at their expense. That is why trading alongside the more experienced traders could be very profitable as well. Which would you rather be part of: the smart minority that fades breakouts or the losing majority that gets caught in false breakouts?

June 22nd, 2011 at 4:53 pm Forex Breakouts – Trade Them or Fade Them? in: Articles , General , Trading concepts Breakouts are among the most popular trading strategies. The concept is simple – to get in on a price move at a time when it is surpassing a previous high or a low. There is a good logic behind it, after all, in order to reach new extremes, the price must clear existing ones. They create either resistances or supports, levels which must be broken, hence the name – breakouts. Obviously, simply buying or selling breakouts does not guarantee profitability. Quite often the price get stopped at these levels. They are always known in advance and attract orders going betting both ways. Some traders want to join in, following the direction of the breakout, while others will look for reversals and place orders accordingly. It is impossible to know in advance who will prevail. Even if one could see an order book from one of the dealers, it is of little help. The Forex market is so fragmented, that whatever insight is possible to have access to, represents only a very small portion of all orders placed. Besides, many traders will be joining the action in progress with markets, which might skew the balance and render the order book useless. This brings on an important question – should you trade breakouts, or fade them? Since the success/failure rate is about 50/50, can it be decided on the fly, as the action unfolds? There are some practical difficulties to this approach, because both strategies are based on slightly different principles. It is the matter of confirmation, or waiting for the bar, during which the event occurs, to close. For our purposes here a price bar and a candlestick are synonymous. http://www.spectrumforex.com/blog1/w...-GBP-CAD-2.jpg http://fxmadness.com/wp-includes/js/.../img/trans.gif In this example, the resistance is at 1.5935. A typical order either a buy (trading the breakout) or a sell would be placed a few pips above it. Unless, of course, one would wait for a confirmation, in shape of a completed candlestick, during which the breakout happens. This carries different risks for either of the approaches. Those buying this breakout might miss a big part of the move, thus missing out on potential profit, so waiting for a confirmation might be counterproductive. http://www.spectrumforex.com/blog1/w...-GBP-CAD-1.jpg This does not happen all the time, but when trading breakouts we can not afford to keep missing such large parts of the move. Which means, the order should be placed close to the resistance, rather than waiting for the confirmation. But that would not work for fading it. That trade would be massively in the red, if entered at the resistance. On the other hand, waiting for a confirmation, would keep a seller here safely away from a losing trade. http://www.spectrumforex.com/blog1/w...-EUR-CHF-1.jpg It is always possible to trade a breakout when it happens, with the intention to stay in the trade until designated objective is reached, but be prepared to switch position immediately, if the breakout candle reverses. This approach demands waiting for the candle to close and then making at quick decision at that time. http://www.spectrumforex.com/blog1/w...-EUR-CHF-2.jpg In this example, the price penetrated the breakout point, but that candlestick closed below the entry point, assuming a bearish form. That could have given a signal to fade the market, thus forcing a reverse in position. While this approach would work, this is a hand picked chart, just to illustrate a point. In most cases the initial breakout bar is not that clear, and one could get easily discouraged, or even lose a lot of money constantly taking these double trades. On the plus side, this is the precise situation for fading the market on a failed breakout . What is one to do? Probably the best solution for a trader is to know what he/she wants to do before a breakout situation and be committed to either go with it or try to fade it, and avoid choosing while the process is under way. Neither approach is necessarily better than the other over time, but one still has to decide which to do. After all, it is hard enough to become consistently profitable doing one thing. Mike K.

Multiplex could be used with some lagging "Hedge-Positions" by using it in combination with the Pivotals and sometimes with the standard deviation "Bollinger Bands" &amp;/or with the "Standard Deviation Channel" (Insert &gt; Channel &gt; Standard Deviation) and with the Multiple Time Frame Analyses and most often without stop loss. May be I'll post some examples the next days or weeks. I don't know because it's time-consuming! Kindest regards FXcube

The Channel Standard Deviation Forex Indicator is the way to measure the volatility based on statistic terms. When the Standard Deviation is changed, so does the width of the channel. How to Add the Channel Standard Deviation on MT4 http://www.tradeviewforex.com/blog/i...%2ftip12-1.JPG The parameters for this indicator are: http://www.tradeviewforex.com/blog/i...%2ftip12-2.JPG The Deviations value corresponds to the Standard Deviation value, which will mark the width of the channel Two points must be taken, one for the start of the channel and one for the end. In this 4H graph, we see the channel formed between August the 24th and September the 25th. The channel has a deviation of 1.8. This value is adjusted in a way that the superior line of the channel acts as a resistance of the pair price and the lower line acts as a support for the pair price. When this channel is broken upwards, we’ll look for LONG positions. When the channel’s broken downwards, we’ll look for SHORT positions. http://www.tradeviewforex.com/blog/i...%2ftip12-3.JPG http://www.tradeviewforex.com/blog/p...atrader-4.aspx

Standard Deviation Channel Standard Deviation Channel is built on base of Linear Regression Trend representing a ussual trendline built between two points on the price chart using the method of least squares. As a result, this line proves to be the exact median line of the changing price. It can be considered as an equilibrium price line, and any deflection up or down indicates the superactivity of buyers or sellers respectively. Standard Deviation Channel consists of two parallel lines, equidistant up and down from the Linear Regression Trend. The distance between frame of the channel and regression line equals to the value of standard close price deviation from the regression line. All price changes take place within Standard Deviation Channel, where the lower frame works as support line , and the upper one does as resistance line . Prices usually exceed the channel frames for a short time. If they keep outside of the channel frames for a longer time than usually, it forecasts the possibility of trend turn. http://ta.mql4.com/c/ta/2008/12/stan...on_channel.gif http://ta.mql4.com/linestudies/stand...iation_channel

Standard Deviation http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg What Does Standard Deviation Mean? 1. A measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean. The more spread apart the data, the higher the deviation. Standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variance. 2. In finance, standard deviation is applied to the annual rate of return of an investment to measure the investment's volatility. Standard deviation is also known as historical volatility and is used by investors as a gauge for the amount of expected volatility. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg Investopedia explains Standard Deviation Standard deviation is a statistical measurement that sheds light on historical volatility. For example, a volatile stock will have a high standard deviation while the deviation of a stable blue chip stock will be lower. A large dispersion tells us how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal returns. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/...ddeviation.asp Standard Deviation Links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StandardDeviation.html http://www.gcseguide.co.uk/standard_deviation.htm http://www.robertniles.com/stats/stdev.shtml http://hubpages.com/hub/stddev http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/A16252.html

Currency Carry Trade http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg What Does Currency Carry Trade Mean? A strategy in which an investor sells a certain currency with a relatively low interest rate and uses the funds to purchase a different currency yielding a higher interest rate. A trader using this strategy attempts to capture the difference between the rates, which can often be substantial, depending on the amount of leverage used. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg Investopedia explains Currency Carry Trade Here's an example of a "yen carry trade": a trader borrows 1,000 Japanese yen from a Japanese bank, converts the funds into U.S. dollars and buys a bond for the equivalent amount. Let's assume that the bond pays 4.5% and the Japanese interest rate is set at 0%. The trader stands to make a profit of 4.5% as long as the exchange rate between the countries does not change. Many professional traders use this trade because the gains can become very large when leverage is taken into consideration. If the trader in our example uses a common leverage factor of 10:1, then she can stand to make a profit of 45%. The big risk in a carry trade is the uncertainty of exchange rates. Using the example above, if the U.S. dollar were to fall in value relative to the Japanese yen, then the trader would run the risk of losing money. Also, these transactions are generally done with a lot of leverage, so a small movement in exchange rates can result in huge losses unless the position is hedged appropriately. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/...carrytrade.asp

To Carry or Not to Carry When Do Carry Trades Work? http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/.../half-full.png Carry trades work best when investors feel risky and optimistic enough to buy high-yielding currencies and sell lower yielding currencies. It's kinda like an optimist who sees the glass half full. While the current situation might not be ideal, he is hopeful that things will get better. The same goes for carry trade. Economic conditions may not be good, but the outlook of the buying currency does need to be positive. If the outlook of a country's economy looks as good as Angelina Jolie, then chances are that that country's central bank will have to raise interest rates in order to control inflation. This is good for carry trade because a higher interest rate means a bigger interest rate differential. On the other hand, if a country's economic prospects aren't looking too good, then nobody will be prepared to take on the currency if they think the central bank will have to lower interest rates to help their economy. To put it simply, carry trades work best when investors have low risk aversion . Carry trades do not work well when risk aversion is high (i.e. selling higher-yielding currencies and buying back lower-yielding currencies). When risk aversion is high, investors are less likely to take risky ventures. Let's put this into perspective. Let's say economic conditions are tough, and the country is currently undergoing a recession. What do you think your next door neighbor would do with his money? Your neighbor would probably choose a low-paying yet safe investment than put it somewhere else. It doesn't matter if the return is low as long as the investment is a "sure thing." This makes sense because this allows your neighbor to have a fall back plan in the event that things go bad, e.g. he loses his job. In forex jargon, your neighbor is said to have a high level of risk aversion . The psychology of big investors isn't that much different from your next door neighbor. When economic conditions are uncertain, investors tend to put their investments in safe haven currencies that offer low interest rates like the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. If you want a specific example, check out Forex Gump's Piponomics article on how risk aversion led to the unwinding of carry trade . This is the polar opposite of carry trade. This inflow of capital towards safe assets causes currencies with low interest to appreciate against those with high interest.

Carry (investment) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The carry of an asset is the return obtained from holding it (if positive), or the cost of holding it (if negative) (see also Cost of carry ). For instance, commodities are usually negative carry assets, as they incur storage costs or may suffer from depreciation, but in some circumstances, appropriately hedged commodities can be positive carry assets if the forward/futures market is willing to pay sufficient premium for future delivery. This can also refer to a trade with more than one leg, where you earn the spread between borrowing a low carry asset and lending a high carry one; such as gold during financial crisis, due to its safe haven quality. Carry trades are not arbitrages : pure arbitrages make money no matter what; carry trades make money only if nothing changes against the carry's favor.

The Carry Trade : How to Trade Using Interest Rates The carry trade is one of the most popular strategies in forex trading because it guarantees some type return on medium or long term positions. Unlike most strategies for the forex market, carry trading does not seek to capture a profit by exploiting changes in the value of a currency pair, but instead focuses on the interest rate differentials in currency pairs. The ideal carry trade is one where the currency pair experiences little change in value but has a wide interest rate differential. http://www.onlineforextrading.com/bl...o-movement.gif What to Look For in a Carry Trade 1.Large interest rate differentials: For example, the British Pound has a 4.50% interest rate and the Japanese Yen has a 0.50% interest rate. That is an interest rate differential of 4%. This means if you borrow Japanese Yen at 0.50% interest rate and invest it in the British Pound at a 4.50% interest rate, you will make 4% in interest on those borrowed funds. 2.Healthy Economy of the Higher Interest Rate Currency In general, a country with a high interest rate should attract more foreign capital as investors seek the highest returns on their investments. The health of the economy should also be taken into consideration. For England, inflation above normal at 3% indicates interest rates may rise in the near future, which is typically good for the British Pound. High inflation isn’t always good, especially in the case of Zimbabwe. The interest rate in Zimbabwe as of October 2008 is 8500.00%. A carry traders deam? Absolutely not, with inflation topping 231,150,888.87% year over year in October, investing in this currency would be a very risky move Popular Carry Trade Set-Ups Because Japanese interest rates have been so low in the recent past, a disproportionate number of carry trades in the forex market have involved the yen. So, let's use the GBP/JPY for a basic example. Let's say you know for a fact that the yen and the British Pound are going to maintain a parity over the coming year with 0.5% interest for the JPY and 4.5% interest for the British Pound. Taking $10,000 and leveraging it 10:1 to buy100,000 units GBP/JPY you will earn roughly with 11GBP per day on that investment, or 4000GBP per year. With the GBP/USD at an average price of 1.75, you would make roughly $7000 on your investment of $70,000 without a single pip move in your favor. In an ideal situation, like the chart below, investor capital will also flow in the direction of the higher yielding currency and the trader will profit on that as well, but that is not the main goal of the carry trade. http://www.onlineforextrading.com/bl...py-uptrend.gif Carry Trade Dangers Of course, the main danger with carry trading is the same with other types of longer-term forex strategies – the currency you are holding might depreciate against your home currency as is occurring in the chart below. If you suspect that this is going to happen, it is time for you to get out. Many carry traders will set their stops on long term carry trades at their trades entry point. This locks in carry profits and stops the trade before it takes position losses. Keep in mind that carry trading is a long term strategy and should be treated as such, so don’t stress out on intraday profits and losses. http://www.onlineforextrading.com/bl...-downtrend.gif http://www.onlineforextrading.com/le.../carry-trading

Dear ForexCube there have been big moves in the EUR/USD and it will be interesting to see how our trading colleagues handle this market. I see that you have your sell positions mostly around 1.4080 and your buys at 1.423x. This is quite a big gap for your hedges. Based on the information from the commerzbank in Frankfurt, they expect the E/U pair to raise up to 1.46 and once the US gets their act together it will go south in a big way.....but as you once said: You never know what monkeys will do next..... happy trading mate! Have a nice day larry

Forexcube, it's like you and I had the same idea on our minds. Care to expand further on the Carry Trade concept - e.g. anything you're currently playing around with? So far I've tried to create a Carry Basket, but my broker has made it difficult with their swap rates, or I'm just not creating a basket properly. So now I had just recently researched Interest Rates of each currency and their fluctuations over time, then I found your recent post about Interest Rates and the Carry Trade.

Understanding the Basics of Forex Trading: Currency Pairs By Joseph Ducat The foreign exchange market, or Forex (FX) for short, is said to be the oldest international trade market. It is also the largest of all trade markets. Analysts have estimated the average yearly trading volume on Forex to be over a trillion dollars. The Forex is not an exchange centralized in any one place, and trading on it takes place 24 hours a day and seven days a week without pause. To trade on this market, you have to understand what is being traded. Forex trading deals with world currencies. A trader buys and sells currencies by exchanging one form of money for another, with the goal of making a profit from the transaction. The market quotations in Forex specify pairs of currencies. They are depicted by showing the base currency followed by a different currency, for example: USD/EUR or GBP/USD. The most commonly traded Forex currency pairs are considered to be: EUR/USD: Euro vs. U.S. Dollar GBP/USD: British Pound vs. U.S. Dollar USD/JPY: U.S. Dollar vs. Japanese Yen USD/CHF: U.S. Dollar vs. Swiss Franc Here's how to interpret a typical Forex quotation. The currency that is shown first is generally known as the base currency, but it is known by other terms as well. It can be called the domestic currency or accounting currency or even be termed as the primary currency of a Forex currency pair. The currency that is shown in second place is called the counter or quote currency. The base currency is always equal to a single monetary unit of exchange (for example, 1 USD, 1 EUR, 1 GBP). This is generally implied and not shown. The quote currency is the amount of that currency that is able to purchase a single unit of the base currency. Forex currency pairs normally depict what is termed the "bid" and "ask" price. The bid price refers to the price at which the broker is willing to buy, while the ask price refers to the price at which the broker is willing to sell. Let's take a look at a sample quotation. Consider a USD/EUR currency pair that is quoted as USD/EUR = 1.8. If you purchase this currency pair, you will receive 1 USD for every 1.8 euros that you sell. If you sell this currency pair, you will earn 1.5 euros for every 1 USD that you sell. http://ezinearticles.com/?Understand...airs&amp;id=427263

Hi the-game Every Broker has different swaps. Generally I like to select those currency pairs which counterbalnce itself in their value by market turmoils when both deliver an interest income. Actual GBPJPY Long (see the monthly chart below, please), in addition I wait for AUDCHF (Long Term Trade) when the cross rate should falling down around 1.71 for getting Long. Have set different Pending Orders between 0.70 - 0.75 and will hedge at M5/M15 this range as well. Also Singapore Dollar (SGD) seems on the right way. GBPHUF Sell was good, but be careful about the weekly chart now (see # 201 , please.), or GBPPLN Sell. Take a look at "Crash-Neutral Currency Carry Trades" or "Evidence of Carry Trades Activity" in the attachment, please. May be it gives some aspects more. Kindest regards FXcube AUDCHF, Monthly, 2011 July 22

The Forex Currency Pairs http://www.instantforexincome.com/im...ency-pairs.jpg Foreign Exchange trading is in general the trading of many currencies of the world . It is emerging as the largest and least regulated market providing the greatest liquidity to investors . This trading is always done in pairs – Currency Pairs, one currency is bought and the other is sold. Together, they make up what is known as the "exchange rate". For example, you may buy Euros with Dollars, anticipating that the Euro to increase in value relative to the Dollar. If the Euro rises relative to the Dollar, you sell the position and can earn a profit. Most commonly traded currencies or the “majors” are: US Dollar (USD) Japanese Yen (JPY) Euro (EUR) British Pound (GBP) Canadian Dollar (CAD) Australian Dollar (AUD) Swiss Franc (CHF) Most commonly traded currency pairs are: US Dollar and the Japanese Yen (USD/JPY) Euro and US Dollar (EUR/USD) US Dollar and Swiss franc (USD/CHF) British Pound and US Dollar (GBP/USD) While quoting currency pairs, the first currency is referred to as the base currency and the second as the counter or quote currency . The base currency is always equal to 1 monetary unit of exchange, for example, 1 Dollar, 1 Pound, 1 Euro. Trading Forex Currency Pairs for Maximum Profit It is also known as domestic currency or accounting currency and sometimes also referred to as the primary currency of a Forex currency pair . The price represents how much of the quote currency is needed to get one unit of the base currency. When a currency is quoted against US Dollar, it is known as direct rate . Any currency not against the US Dollar is called a cross rate. The quote currency is translated into a certain number of units of the base currency. This is also referred to as the foreign currency, secondary currency or counter currency . For example, if you find that a quote of USD/JPY is at 1.30, it says that for every 1 US Dollar, you get 1.30 Japanese Yen. When you quote for AUD/JPY of 67.73, it says that for every 1 Australian Dollar, you get 67.73 Japanese Yen. Currency pairs are generally traded as 100,000 units of the base currency. For example, if you were buying EUR/USD at 0.95 you would be paying Dollars for Euros as follows: 100,000 x .95 = $95,000 for 100,000 Euros When you find a quote going up, it means that the value of the base currency is rising or in other words, it is getting stronger . If a quote is going down, it means that the base currency is weakening. The dominant base currencies are: Euro - EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/CHF, EUR/JPY, EUR/CAD British Pound - GBP/USD, GBP/CHF, GBP/JPY, GBP/CAD US Dollar - USD/CAD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF The currency pairs are usually traded and quoted with a ‘bid’ and ‘ask’ price . The ‘bid’ is the price at which you are willing to buy and the ‘ask’ is the price at which price you are willing to sell. For example, if the USD/EUR currency pair is quoted as - USD/EUR = 1.5 and you purchase the pair, this means that for every 1.5 euros that you sell, you get US$1. If you sold the currency pair, you receive 1.5 euros for every US$1 you sell. The key to successful trading lies in selecting one or two pairs of currencies that you wish to trade in as a beginner. As you gain confidence , you may wish to add more pairs in your trading portfolio. But for a new trader or investor it is always advised to have limited pair just to ensure simplicity . http://www.instantforexincome.com/currency_pairs.html

A Forex Carry Trade Strategy Written by Betty Samang The carry trade, which involves going long a high-yielding currency against a low-yielding one is very popular among long term currency traders. Nowadays, carry traders love the yen crosses due to the very low JPY interest rate, for example, the GBP/JPY or NZD/JPY cross currency pairs. Carry trades are typically held for several month or even years. Currently, when holding a long position in the GPB/JPY pair, forex brokers will pay out over $23 a day per 100,000 units in interest. Now, when you think about building a carry trade, you should not think in the same terms as you normally think when you trade forex. You have to use much lower leverage, and you have to become a lot more conservative since you are planning to keep the trade for a longer time period. A carry trade can be an amazing opportunity to generate very good passive income ...similar to a real estate investment. Daily rollover interest debit/credit Formula Number of lots (Units) x (base currency interest rate - quote currency interest rate) / 365 days per year x current base currency rate = daily rollover interest debit/credit GBP/JPY Carry Trade Example Because UK has 5.25% rate, and Japan has 0.25% rate, this cross is very attractive for carry traders looking for buy opportunities only since they want to earn daily interest on the open position. Preferred timeframe's to make trading decisions are daily and weekly charts because they are looking to keep the trade for a longer time period. It really makes no sense to study a 5 min chart to take a carry trade. http://www.aboutcurrency.com/images/...carrytrade.gif A very simple strategy is the moving average cross over, looking to the above example, we only go long when the 5EMA crosses the 200SMA from below (up trend) but we do not take trades when the 5EMA crosses the 200SMA from above (down trend) because the carry trade strategy would focus only on interest-positive trades: in the case of the GBP/JPY, long trades. When you are long GBP/JPY, most forex brokers will pay out over $23 a day per 100,000 units in interest which is paid on a daily basis. If for example, you keep the trade for 200 days, this would bring an amazing $4600* interest credited to your account not including the pips you lose or gain. * The above calculation is an example only and is to be used for educational and informative purposes only since the amount actually debited or credited to your account will vary depending on the forex broker. Most brokers display the daily rollover interest fees on their online trading platform. Carry Trade Strategy Identify a pair like GPB/JPY with a high interest differential Apply Technical Analysis and create a rule-based trading strategy using longer term timeframe's only Only long the currency bearing the higher interest rate: in the case of the GBP/JPY, long trades Keep an eye on the interest rate differential because it can vary over time Another strategy is to open inversely correlated positions that are both interest-positive. This way, any losses in one currency's price would be (roughly) offset by gains in the other, while both earned interest. This is the idea behind a balanced basket of interest-earning currencies. Interesting Carry Trade Pairs All pairs that include the Yen due to the very low JPY interest rate.(date 02/15/2007) http://www.aboutcurrency.com/strateg...strategy.shtml

Is the “carry trade” coming back? The most important current fundamental for forex traders is the anticipation of an exit strategy from extreme accommodative policy in the West. When will quantitative easing and related monetary stimulus in response to the global credit crisis end? The central banks of the G7 are at a point where they are looking at ending stimulus and beginning to increase interest rates to slow down inflation, which depending on who you are talking to already is here or on the way. Some already have increased rates, and those that have not now are facing a post-quantitative easing era. Now is the time to prepare trading strategies that can benefit from this historic shift. A key step for the forex trader is to realize that a change in interest rate policies across the globe will create ripple effects in almost every currency. When interest rates go up in one country, an imbalance is created in capital flows throughout the world. It is not necessarily the actual interest rate level that is important, but the anticipation that rate increases will continue; that attracts even greater demand for the currency. This is because of the "carry trade" where low-interest currencies are sold or borrowed against and the capital raised goes to the higher-interest-rate currencies. The carry trade collapsed in 2008 as capital had to be repatriated back by the borrowers who had to pay off bad debt. The yen, which has been a favorite funding currency in the carry trade, took a big hit when heavy yen buying followed the tragic earthquake in Japan earlier this year. That was more of a temporary psychological reaction than one driven by interest rate fundamentals. The yen, with G-7 intervention, resumed a weakening direction and the yen carry trader, in-effect, has reappeared as a weaker yen is technically and politically favored. An easy way to detect the resumption of the carry trade as a strategy is to watch the iPath Optimized Currency Carry ETN (ICI). ICI is designed to reflect the total return of an "Intelligent Carry Strategy" and is now forming a triple top at $47. If it breaks out, it will be a clear signal that global conditions favor a carry trade revival (see "Back to the carry"). The challenge for the forex trader is how to participate in this powerful force. http://www.futuresmag.com/Issues/201...rxTrd_Back.png For traders to take advantage of increased interest in the carry trade, they must closely monitor interest rate differentials. When one currency is actually increasing rates while another is not, capital will flow away from that currency to seek the higher return. Following this pattern, several currency pairs can be traded to take advantage of carry as well as to anticipate increased differentials. For example, the EUR/GBP crosspair is likely to strengthen — if the European Central Bank raises rates and the Bank of England does not. Similarly the Swiss franc, a low-yielding safe-haven currency that has strengthened against the euro by over 3,700 pips in the last four years, finally may be able to weaken. The Swiss central bank desires a weaker currency and may keep rates low as the ECB raises rates. The yen is likely to keep its status as the lowest yielding currency and as a result the AUD/JPY and EUR/JPY cross-pairs will receive the benefits of bullish sentiment. If rate increases in the G7 continue in the coming months, the Brazilian real will become more vulnerable to a sell off. Even though its interest rate is at an astronomical level of 11.75%, a change in its differential with other currencies may be the tipping point for weakening this currency. However, when it comes to the U.S. dollar, the situation is more tentative. The U.S. dollar is still a low-yielding currency and also may suffer from the carry effect. Yet, if Fed Chief Ben Bernanke signals the end of quantitative easing or signals vigilance on inflation, the U.S. dollar may attract investors and traders anticipating a potential rate hike. In any case, interest rate differentials and expected changes in interest rate differentials, rather than risk aversion, will become the major fundamental force for traders to contend with in the coming year. Forex traders should watch out, as the carry trade offers some extraordinary opportunities. Abe Cofnas is the author of "Sentiment Indicators" (Bloomberg Press).

Icelandic Kronur: Lessons from a Failed Carry Trade A little more than two years ago, the Icelandic Kronur was one of the hottest currencies in the world. Thanks to a benchmark interest rate of 18%, the Kronur had particular appeal for carry traders, who worried not about the inherent risks of such a strategy. Shortly thereafter, the Kronur (as well as Iceland’s economy and banking sector) came crashing down, and many traders were wiped out. Now that a couple of years have passed, it’s probably worth reflecting on this turn of events. http://www.forexblog.org/wp-content/...ical-Rates.jpg At its peak, nominal GDP was a relatively modest $20 Billion, sandwiched between Nepal and Turkmenistan in the global GDP rankings. Its population is only 300,000, its current account has been mired in persistent deficit, and its Central Bank boasts a mere $8 Billion in foreign exchange reserves. That being the case, why did investors flock to Iceland and not Turkmenistan? The short answer to that question is interest rates . As I said, Iceland’s benchmark interest rate exceeded 18% at its peak. There are plenty of countries that offered similarly high interest rates, but Iceland was somehow perceived as being more stable. While it didn’t apply to join the European Union (its application is still pending) until last year, Iceland has always benefited from its association with Europe in general, and Scandinavia in particular. Thanks to per capita GDP of $38,000 per person, its reputation as a stable, advanced economy was not unwarranted. On the other hand, Iceland has always struggled with high inflation, which means its interest rates were never very high in real terms. In addition, the deregulation of its financial sector opened the door for its banks to take huge risks with deposits. Basically, depositors – many from outside the country – parked their savings in Icelandic banks, which turned around and invested the money in high-yield / high-risk ventures. When the credit crisis struck, its banks were quickly wiped out, and the government chose not to follow in the footsteps of other governments and bail them out. http://www.forexblog.org/wp-content/...-1998-2011.png Moreover, it doesn’t look like Iceland will regain its luster any time soon. Its economy has shrunk by 40% over the last two years, and one prominent economist has estimated that it will take 7-10 years for it to fully recover. Unemployment and inflation remain high even though interest rates have been cut to 4.25% – a record low. The Kronur has lost 50% of its value against the Dollar and the Euro, the stock market has been decimated, and the recent decision to not remunerate Dutch and British insurance companies that lost money in Iceland’s crash will only serve to further spook foreign investors. In short, while the Kronur will probably recover some of its value over the next few years (aided by the possibility of joining the Euro), it probably won’t find itself on the radar screens of carry traders anytime soon. In hindsight, Iceland’s economy was an accident waiting to happen, and the global financial crisis only magnified the problem. With Iceland – as well as a dozen other currencies and securities – investors believed they had found the proverbial free lunch. After all, where else could you earn an 18% by putting money in a savings account? Never mind that inflation was just as high; with the Kronur rising, carry traders felt assured that they would make a tidy profit on any funds deposited in Iceland. The collapse of the Kronur, however, has shown us that the carry trade is anything but risk-free. In fact, 18% is more than what lenders to Greece and Ireland can expect to earn, which means that it is ultimately a very risky investment. In this case, the 18% that was being paid to depositors were generated by making very risky investments. As the negotiations with the insurance companies have revealed, depositors had nothing protecting them from bank failure, which is ultimately what happened. http://www.forexblog.org/wp-content/...-2002-2011.png Now that the carry trade is making a comeback, it’s probably a good time to take a step back and re-assess the risks of such a strategy. Even if Iceland proves to be an extreme case – since most countries won’t let their banks fail – traders must still acknowledge the possibility of massive currency depreciation. In other words, even if the deposits themselves are guaranteed, there is an ever-present risk that converting that deposit back into one’s home currency will result in losses. That’s especially true for a currency that is as illiquid as the Kronur (so illiquid that it took me a while to even find a reliable quote!), and is susceptible to liquidity crunches and short squeezes. When you enter into a carry trade, understand that a spike in volatility could wipe out all of your profits in one session. The only way to minimize your risk is to hedge your exposure . http://www.forexblog.org/2011/04/ice...rry-trade.html

Carry Trade Strategy ← Back to Forex Strategy List Carry Trade strategy — it's one of the most popular fundamental Forex trading strategies. It's used not only by the common retail traders but also by the big hedge funds. The main principle of the carry trade strategies is to buy currency with a high interest rate and sell one with a low interest rate. Such setup offers profit not only from the currency pair's fluctuations but also from the interest rate difference (overnight interest rate). This strategy should only be applied under the normal global economic conditions. You should never use it during the crisis. Remember that your Forex broker should be one of those that actually pay overnight interest rate difference if you want to earn from it. You won't be able to earn from it if your broker is "swap-free". Features Long-term profit potential. Two sources of profit. Works only with the growing global economy. How to Trade? Choose a currency pair with a rather high positive interest rate difference (AUD/JPY, NZD/JPY and GBP/JPY are good historical examples of such pairs). Go Long or Short on the chosen pair, depending on the direction with the positive overnight interest rate for this pair. Choose moderate position size, so that it would be able to hold a significant paper loss. Don't set a stop-loss (one of the few Forex trading strategies, where stop-loss isn't recommended). Wait. When you feel that you earned enough or you expect some global financial turmoil, close the position. Example http://www.earnforex.com/forex-strat...rade-chart.png The example chart depicts a long-term "carry trade" growth of GBP/JPY from late 2000 till mid 2006. The pound had an interest rate of about 5% during the period, while the yen had its rate near zero, resulting in an overnight rate of about 5%, which is then multiplied by your leverage. With 1:100 leverage it's approximately 2,500% over the whole period. During the period GBP/JPY also rose by more than 6500 pips. As you see, the profit potential is simply outstanding. The problem is that the uptrend ended very fast in 2007 and traders had little time to react and close the positions. The carry trade is quite risky and you should be very careful when deciding to use it. Warning! Use this strategy at your own risk. EarnForex.com can't be responsible for any losses associated with using any strategy presented on the site. It's not recommended to use this strategy on the real account without testing it on demo first. http://www.earnforex.com/forex-strat...trade-strategy

Trend Lines Trendlines are just one of the tools seasoned traders use along with other indicators to provide a reliable Forex entry signal. Plotting a trend line on a Forex chart could give very valuable information. Trade Example: EURUSD, M30, 2011 July 22

Trend Lines Trend lines are probably the most common form of technical analysis. They are probably one of the most underutilized ones as well. If drawn correctly, they can be as accurate as any other method. Unfortunately, most traders don't draw them correctly or try to make the line fit the market instead of the other way around. In their most basic form, an uptrend line is drawn along the bottom of easily identifiable support areas (valleys). In a downtrend, the trend line is drawn along the top of easily identifiable resistance areas (peaks). How do you draw trend lines? To draw trend lines properly, all you have to do is locate two major tops or bottoms and connect them. What's next? Nothing. Uhh, is that it? Yep, it's that simple. Here are trend lines in action! Look at those waves! http://babypips.cachefly.net/school/...es-example.png Types of Trends There are three types of trends: Uptrend (higher lows) Downtrend (lower highs) Sideways trends (ranging) http://ads.babypips.com/newads/www/d...&amp;cb=75fc022837 Here are some important things to remember about trend lines: It takes at least two tops or bottoms to draw a valid trend line but it takes THREE to confirm a trend line. The STEEPER the trend line you draw, the less reliable it is going to be and the more likely it will break. Like horizontal support and resistance levels, trend lines become stronger the more times they are tested. And most importantly, DO NOT EVER draw trend lines by forcing them to fit the market. If they do not fit right, then that trend line isn't a valid one!

Trendline Forex Entry Signal - Two High Probability Setups By Michael A Jones A reliable Forex entry signal usually involves a combination of factors which all come together at the same time. No single indicator can provide the ideal entry level and the new Forex trader has to grapple with this stark reality. Many find this hard to accept and spend countless weeks and months and hard earned cash in search of what could be termed the 'holy grail.' Learning to trade the Forex is hard work and needs to be treated like a business, the same as any other business. It requires a large investment of time, energy, mental discipline, and a cautious investment of cash until the necessary skills are acquired. Trendlines are just one of the tools seasoned traders use along with other indicators to provide a reliable Forex entry signal. Here we spell out two distinct ways in which trendlines can be used safely. Using a higher time frame candlestick chart such as a 60 minute, 4 hour, or even daily chart, a trendline is drawn along the most significant lows in an uptrend or across the most significant highs in a downtrend. 1. Momentum Combo As price moves upward in an uptrend or downward in a downtrend, it will retrace and bounce off the trendline at certain times. However, using a trendline bounce by itself as a Forex entry signal is too risky. There have to be other factors. Once you have drawn the trendline you now have a graphical representation of price movement and you will be able to see where price has to retrace to test the trendline once again. Now use other indicators to see if that level where price would need to retrace to test the trendline combines with other factors. Calculate your daily pivot points and draw horizontal lines on your chart to mark them. Run your eyes left on the chart and note if there were any significant highs or lows that formed support or resistance within the last few days. Support and resistance on higher time frames usually provide more substantial reference points. Use the Fibonacci tool on your charting software and mark retracement and/or extension levels on a variety of swing highs and lows and see if any intersect the trendline. Also make sure you have the 200 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) line shown on your charts and note whether this also intersects near or at the trendline. Now if you have a combination of two or three of the above indicators meeting at the same place you have now identified a Forex entry signal that can be regarded as high probability. Put in your entry order to be take in long at this point where the trendline intersects with the other indicators and set a reasonable target limit for what probably will be a profitable trade. For a downtrend, simply use the above indicators going the other way. 2. Break Combo The second way to identify a reliable Forex entry signal using trendlines is to watch for a break of a trendline on a higher time frame such as the 60 minute, 4 hour, or daily chart. Some traders sent an entry order to go long or short once price has broken the trendline by a few pips. That works for some. There is however a safer way to trade a trendline break. It will be observed that often (not always, nothing is absolutely certain when trading the Forex) once price has broken a trendline and moved 15-30 pips, it will come back, retrace, and test the backside of that trendline. This is where again you use the combination of factors mentioned in the previous strategy. Look to see if the point at which price may come back to test the backside of the trendline coincides or combines with factors such as: Pivot points Previous swing highs or lows marking support and resistance Fibonacci retracement or extension levels 200 EMA Now when you place an entry order to be taken in at that level you are doing so on the basis of a clearly defined Forex entry signal. For a graphical example of the above, see the resource box below. Be aware that trading trendline signals on lower time frames such as 30 minute, 15 minute, or even 5 minute charts are very high risk trades. Price will break these short term time frames frequently during the course of a day and catch a new trader frequently by luring them into a trade they later regret. Be patient and wait for things to setup as described in the two methods above for high probability trades triggered by a combination Forex entry signal.

Trend Line Break Forex Reversal Strategy Forex Reversal Strategies Written by Semmy Le For short entries, draw a trend line connecting the support bottoms and wait until the support trend line is broken. Always wait until the candle is completed (use closing prices to avoid fake entries). Then enter a short position in the market. Place stop loss 2 pips above the entry candle. Take profit strategy for short positions: When a candlestick occurs whose range is greater than the previous three ranges and whose close is in the bottom 15% of the candle, exit a short position on the FIRST closing price that is higher than the previous closing price. (see example below) For long entries, draw a trend line connecting the resistance tops and wait until the resistance trend line is broken. Always wait until the candle is completed (use closing prices). Then enter a long position in the market. Place stop loss 2 pips below the entry candle. Take profit strategy for long positions: When a candlestick occurs whose range is greater than the previous three ranges and whose close is in the top 15% of the candle, exit a long position on the FIRST closing price that is lower than the previous closing price. Preferred Timeframe's 1 Hour and above Currency pairs Any pairs of your choice Euro/Dollar 1 Hour Short Entry Trading example http://www.fxtsp.com/images/stories/...orex-strat.gif We draw a trend line connecting the support bottoms. Then there's a 1 hour closing price below the rising trend line and we enter a short position in the market. The short entry price: 1.2336.

Interest Rates Table (Forex Interest Rates) Central bank interest rate is the rate at which country's central banking institutions lend short-term money to the country's commercial banks. Interest rates also play an important role in Forex market. Because the currencies bought via broker are not delivered to the buyer, broker should pay trader an interest based on the difference between "short" currency interest rate and "long" currency interest rate. In the interest rates table you can not only find the current interest rates of 20 different countries, but also scroll back in time and see how and when interest rates were changed by the central banks. Interest rates of the following countries are covered in this interest rates table : United States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, Chile, South Africa, Sweden, Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Poland, Latvia, Hungary and Czech Republic. http://www.topforexnews.com/interest-rates-table/ Click the small green arrows above and below the table to see the past rates decisions. http://www.topforexnews.com/images/I...Rates/left.gif 0.125% † on 2009-08-12 by 0% Federal Reserve System 1.50% on 2011-07-07 by 0.25% European Central Bank 0.50% on 2009-10-08 by 0% Bank of England 0.10% on 2009-05-22 by 0% Bank of Japan 1.00% on 2010-09-08 by 0.25% Bank of Canada 4.75% on 2010-11-02 by 0.25% Reserve Bank of Australia 2.50% on 2011-03-10 by 0.50% Reserve Bank of New Zealand 0.375% * on 2009-03-12 by 0.125% Swiss National Bank 5.50% on 2010-11-10 by 0.50% South African Reserve Bank 5.25% on 2011-06-14 by 0.25% Central Bank of Chile 1.55% on 2011-07-08 by 0.25% Danmarks Nationalbank 2.25% on 2011-05-13 by 0.25% Norges Bank 2.00% on 2011-07-06 by 1.75% Riksbank 12.25% on 2011-06-08 by 0.25% Banco Central do Brasil 0.75% on 2010-05-07 by 0.25% Czech National Bank 6.00% http://www.topforexnews.com/images/I...t-Rates/up.gif on 2011-01-25 by 0.25% Magyar Nemzeti Bank 3.50% on 2010-03-24 by 0.50% Bank of Latvia 4.50% on 2011-06-08 by 0.25% National Bank of Poland 8.25% on 2011-05-02 by 0.25% Bank of Russia 3.25% on 2011-06-10 by 0.25% Bank of Korea http://www.topforexnews.com/images/I...Rates/left.gif Note: Not all 'Unchanged' central bank decisions are included into the above table. † Federal Reserve set the interest rate range since December 16th, 2008.

Forex swap From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Exchange rates Forex swap Currency swap Foreign exchange option In finance , a forex swap (or FX swap ) is a simultaneous purchase and sale of identical amounts of one currency for another with two different value dates (normally spot to forward). [1] ; see Foreign exchange derivative . Contents [ hide ] 1 Structure 2 Uses 3 Pricing 4 Related instruments 5 See also 6 References [ edit ] Structure A forex swap consists of two legs: a spot foreign exchange transaction, and a forward foreign exchange transaction. These two legs are executed simultaneously for the same quantity, and therefore offset each other. It is also common to trade forward-forward , where both transactions are for (different) forward dates. [ edit ] Uses By far and away the most common use of FX swaps is for institutions to fund their foreign exchange balances. Once a foreign exchange transaction settles, the holder is left with a positive (or long ) position in one currency, and a negative (or short ) position in another. In order to collect or pay any overnight interest due on these foreign balances, at the end of every day institutions will close out any foreign balances and re-institute them for the following day. To do this they typically use tom-next swaps, buying (or selling) a foreign amount settling tomorrow, and then doing the opposite, selling (or buying) it back settling the day after. The interest collected or paid every night is referred to as the cost of carry . As currency traders know roughly how much holding a currency position will make or cost on a daily basis, specific trades are put on based on this; these are referred to as carry trades . [ edit ] Pricing The relationship between spot and forward is as follows: http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/5...b6c380d1ae.png where: F = forward rate S = spot rate r1 = simple interest rate of the term currency r2 = simple interest rate of the base currency T = tenor (calculated according to the appropriate day count convention ) The forward points or swap points are quoted as the difference between forward and spot, F - S, and is expressed as the following: http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/b...a85912716f.png where r1 and r2 are small. Thus, the absolute value of the swap points increases when the interest rate differential gets larger, and vice versa. [ edit ] Related instruments A forex swap should not be confused with a currency swap , which is a much rarer, long term transaction, governed by a slightly different set of rules. [ edit ] See also Currency swap Overnight index swap Foreign exchange market Interest rate swap http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forex_swap

Forex Market Daily Interest Rollover Written by Tom Van Geert In the spot fx market, trades settle in two business days and open trading positions held at time of rollover are automatically rolled over by the forex broker to the next settlement date, the open trade position is swapped for a new position expiring the following settlement date at 5pm EST rollover. This is also known as "tomorrow, next day" or simply "tom next." For example, if you buy 200,000 Euros on Monday, you must deliver 200,000 Euros on Wednesday. On Wednesdays, the amount added or subtracted to an account as a result of rolling over a position tends to be around three times the usual amount. This "3-Day" rollover accounts for settlement of trades through the weekend period. How does this affect your forex trading account? If you are long the currency bearing the higher interest rate then you should earn interest, automatically credited to your trading account. Conversely, if you are short the currency bearing the higher interest rate then you should experience a small debit to your account. Be aware that most forex brokers require a 2% margin set for your account in order to receive interest. If not, you will have to pay for the rollover, it doesn't matter whether you are long or short the currency bearing the higher interest rate Day Traders For day traders, who almost never hold any overnight positions, the rollover is not applicable because there are no positions to roll, and therefore no interest is earned or paid. Swing Traders If you are a swing, position or long term trader, the rollover will affect your account since you'll earn or pay interest on a daily basis. Therefore, it is recommend to set your account at 2% margin and only try to long the currency bearing the higher interest rate. A strategy for the longer term trader is the carry trade, which relies on a big interest rate differential between the two traded currencies. For example the NZD/JPY currency cross pair. Currently, traders earn a $13 daily rollover interest, credited to their accounts at 5PM EST while holding a long position in this pair for each standard lot(1 standard lot equals 100,000 units) traded; BUT, if you are short NDZ/JPY, your account will be debited $14/day for each standard lot traded! Interesting fact to know, isn't it? Rollover example If you are long 300,000 EUR/USD at rollover (5PM est) and EUR/USD at rollover is trading at 1.3200, the EUR short-term interest rate is 3.50% and the USD short-term interest rate is 5.25%, the rollover debit or credit to your account would be as follows: Rollover Formula Number of lots (Units) x (base currency interest rate - quote currency interest rate) / 365 days per year x current base currency rate = daily rollover interest debit/credit Calculation* Therefore: 300,000 x (3.50% - 5.25%) / 365 x 1.3200 = -$16,98 daily rollover interest debit -$16,98 rollover debit will be subtracted to your trading account at 5PM EST as a result of rolling over since you are long the currency bearing the lower interest rate. * The above calculation is an example only and is to be used for educational and informative purposes only since the amount actually debited or credited to your account will vary depending on the forex broker. Most brokers display the daily rollover interest fees on their online trading platform. http://www.aboutcurrency.com/univers...Rollover.shtml

What does rollover mean in the context of the forex market? In the forex (FX) market, rollover is the process of extending the settlement date of an open position. In most currency trades, a trader is required to take delivery of the currency two days after the transaction date. However, by rolling over the position - simultaneously closing the existing position at the daily close rate and re-entering at the new opening rate the next trading day - the trader artificially extends the settlement period by one day. Often referred to as tomorrow next , rollover is useful in FX because many traders have no intention of taking delivery of the currency they buy - rather, they want to profit from changes in the exchange rates. Since every forex trade is transacted by borrowing one country's currency to buy another, receiving and paying interest is a regular occurrence. At the close of every trading day, a trader who took a long position in a high yielding currency relative to the currency that he or she borrowed will receive an amount of interest in his or her account. Conversely, a trader will need to pay interest if the currency he or she borrowed has a higher interest rate relative to the currency that he or she purchased. Traders who do not want to collect or pay interest should close out of their positions by 5pm ET. Note that the interest that is received or paid by a currency trader in the course of these forex trades is regarded by the IRS as ordinary interest income or expense . For tax purposes, the currency trader should keep track of interest received or paid, separate from regular trading gains and losses. http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/rollover.asp

Foreign Exchange Market The Foreign exchange market is a large, growing and liquid financial market that operates 24 hours a day. It is not a market in the traditional sense because there is no central trading location or â€œexchange". Most of the trading is conducted by telephone or through electronic trading networks. The primary market for currencies is the â€œinterbank marketâ€ where banks, insurance companies, large corporations and other large financial institutions manage the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates. Spot Market The market for buying and selling currencies at the current market rate. Rollover A spot transaction is generally due for settlement within two business days (the value date). The cost of rolling over a transaction is based on the interest rate differential between the two currencies in a transaction. If you are long (bought) the currency with a higher rate of interest you will earn interest. If you are short (sold) the currency with a higher rate of interest you will pay interest. Most brokers will automatically roll over your open positions allowing you to hold your position indefinitely. How to calculate rollover interest Rollovers in Forex Exchange Rate The value of one currency expressed in terms of another. For example, if EUR/USD is 1.3200, 1 Euro is worth US$1.3200. Currency Pair The two currencies that make up an exchange rate. When one is bought, the other is sold, and vice versa. Base Currency The first currency in the pair. Also the currency your account is denominated in. Counter Currency The second currency in the pair. Also known as the terms currency. ISO Currency Codes USD = US Dollar EUR = Euro JPY = Japanese Yen GBP = British Pound CHF = Swiss Franc CAD = Canadian Dollar AUD = Australian Dollar NZD = New Zealand Dollar For a full list, see ISO Currency Codes Currency Pair Terminology EUR/USD = "Euro" USD/JPY = "Dollar Yen" GBP/USD = "Cable" or "Sterling" USD/CHF = "Swissy" USD/CAD = "Dollar Canada" (CAD referred to as the "Loonie") AUD/USD = "Aussie Dollar" NZD/USD = "Kiwi" FCM Futures Commission Merchant. An individual or organisation licensed by the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to deal in futures products and accept monies from clients to trade them. Dealing Desk A dealing desk provides pricing, liquidity and execution of trades. Market Maker A market maker provides pricing and liquidity for a particular currency pair and stands ready to buy or sell that currency at the quoted price. A market maker takes the opposite side of your trade and has the option of either holding that position or partially or fully offsetting it with other market participants, managing their aggregate exposure to their clients. If a market maker chooses to keep the trader's position without offsetting it in the market, the trader's profit is the market maker's loss and vice versa, leading to a possible conflict of interest between the trader and his market maker. A market maker earns their commission from the spread between the bid and offer price. Example of Market Makers NDD An acronym for 'No Dealing Desk'. A no-dealing desk broker does not have a dealing desk but instead uses external liquidity providers to provide pricing and liquidity for its clients. The liquidity providers send in competing bids and offers into the platform, resulting in the best bid and offer being displayed to the client. Some no-dealing desk brokers may display the market depth which is the amount of liquidity available at each price. A greater number of liquidity providers providing pricing to the no-dealing desk broker leads to tighter spreads . A no-dealing desk broker may increase the spread to earn its commission. Example of No Dealing Desk Brokers Forex ECN Broker ECN is an acronym for Electronic Communications Network. A Forex ECN broker does not have a dealing desk but instead provides a marketplace where multiple market makers, banks and traders can enter in competing bids and offers into the platform and have their trades filled by multiple liquidity providers in an anonymous trading environment. The trades are done in the name of your ECN broker, thereby providing you with complete anonymity. A trader might have their buy order filled by liquidity provider "A", and close the same order against liquidity provider "B", or have their trade matched internally by the bid or offer of another trader. The best bid and offer is displayed to the trader along with the market depth which is the combined volume available at each price. A greater number of marketplace participants providing pricing to the ECN broker leads to tighter spreads. ECN's typically charge a small fee for matching trades between their clients and liquidity providers. Example of ECN Brokers Counterparty One of the participants in a transaction. Sell Quote / Bid Price The sell quote is displayed on the left and is the price at which you can sell the base currency. It is also referred to as the market maker's bid price. For example, if the EUR/USD quotes 1.3200/03, you can sell 1 Euro at the bid price of US$1.3200. Buy Quote / Offer Price The buy quote is displayed on the right and is the price at which you can buy the base currency. It is also referred to as the market maker's ask or offer price. For example, if the EUR/USD quotes 1.3200/03, you can buy 1 Euro at the offer price of US$1.3203. Spread The difference between the sell quote and the buy quote or the bid and offer price. For example, if EUR/USD quotes read 1.3200/03, the spread is the difference between 1.3200 and 1.3203, or 3 pips. In order to break even on a trade, a position must move in the direction of the trade by an amount equal to the spread. Pip The smallest price increment a currency can make. Also known as points. For example, 1 pip = 0.0001 for EUR/USD, or 0.01 for USD/JPY. Pip Value The value of a pip. Pip value can be either fixed or variable depending on the currency pair. e.g. The pip value for EUR/USD is always $10 for standard lots, $1 for mini-lots and $0.10 for micro lots. How to Calculate Pip Values Pip Value Calculator Lot The standard unit size of a transaction. Typically, one standard lot is equal to 100,000 units of the base currency, 10,000 units if it's a mini, or 1,000 units if it's a micro. Some dealers offer the ability to trade in any unit size, down to as little as 1 unit. Standard Account Trading with standard lot sizes, generally 100,000 units of the base currency. e.g. The pip value is $10 for EUR/USD. Mini Account Trading with mini lot sizes, generally 10,000 units of the base currency. e.g. The pip value is $1 for EUR/USD. Micro Account Trading with micro lot sizes, generally 1,000 units of the base currency. e.g. The pip value is $0.10 for EUR/USD. Margin The deposit required to open or maintain a position. Margin can be either "free" or "used". Used margin is that amount which is being used to maintain an open position, whereas free margin is the amount available to open new positions. With a $1,000 margin balance in your account and a 1% margin requirement to open a position, you can buy or sell a position worth up to a notional $100,000. This allows a trader to leverage his account by up to 100 times or a leverage ratio of 100:1. If a trader's account falls below the minimum amount required to maintain an open position, he will receive a "margin call" requiring him to either add more money into his or her account or to close the open position. Most brokers will automatically close a trade when the margin balance falls below the amount required to keep it open. The amount required to maintain an open position is dependent on the broker and could be 50% of the original margin required to open the trade. Leverage Leverage is the ability to gear your account into a position greater than your total account margin. For instance, if a trader has $1,000 of margin in his account and he opens a $100,000 position, he leverages his account by 100 times, or 100:1. If he opens a $200,000 position with $1,000 of margin in his account, his leverage is 200 times, or 200:1. Increasing your leverage magnifies both gains and losses. To calculate the leverage used, divide the total value of your open positions by the total margin balance in your account. For example, if you have $10,000 of margin in your account and you open one standard lot of USD/JPY (100,000 units of the base currency) for $100,000, your leverage ratio is 10:1 ($100,000 / $10,000). If you open one standard lot of EUR/USD for $150,000 (100,000 x EURUSD 1.5000) your leverage ratio is 15:1 ($150,000 / $10,000). Understanding leverage Part I Understanding leverage Part II Calculate Leverage Manual Execution An order which is executed by dealer intervention. Automatic Execution The order is executed automatically without dealer intervention or involvement. Slippage The difference between the order price and the executed price, measured in pips. Slippage often occurs in fast moving and volatile markets, or where there is manual execution of trades. Drawdown The decline in account balance from peak to valley, measured until a new high is reached, usually reported in percentage terms. Support Support is a technical price level where buyers outweigh sellers, causing prices to bounce off a temporary price floor. Resistance Resistance is a technical price level where sellers outweigh buyers, causing prices to bounce off a temporary price ceiling. Common Order Types Market Order An order to buy or sell at the current market price. Limit Order An order to buy or sell at a pre-specified price level. Stop-Loss Order An order to restrict losses at a pre-specified price level. Limit Entry Order An order to buy below the market or sell above the market at a pre-specified level, believing that the price will reverse direction from that point. Stop-Entry Order An order to buy above the market or sell below the market at a pre-specified level, believing that the price will continue in the same direction. OCO Order One Cancels Other. An order whereby if one is executed, the other is cancelled. GTC Order Good Till Cancelled. An order stays in the market until it is either filled or cancelled. Common Trade Types Long Position A position in which the trader attempts to profit from an increase in price. i.e. Buy low, sell high. Short Position A position in which the trader attempts to profit from a decrease in price. i.e. Sell high, buy low. Common Trading Styles Technical Analysis A style of trading that involves analysing price charts for technical patterns of behaviour. Technical Analysis Books Fundamental Analysis A style of trading that involves analysing the macroeconomic factors of an economy underpinning the value of a currency and placing trades that support the trader's long or short-term outlook. Trend Trading A style of trading that attempts to profit from riding short, medium or long term trends in price. Sniper Forex Trend Trading System Range Trading A style of trading that attempts to profit from buying and selling currencies between a lower level of support and an upper level of resistance. The upper level of resistance and the lower level of support defines the range. The range forms a price channel where the price can be seen to oscillate between the two levels of support and resistance. Article: Identifying Trending &amp; Range Bound Currencies News Trading A style of trading whereby a trader attempts to profit from fundamental news announcements on a country's economy that may affect the value of a currency, usually seeking short term profit immediately after the announcement is released. Scalping A style of trading that involves frequent trading seeking small gains over a very short period of time. Trades can last from seconds to minutes. Day Trading A style of trading that involves multiple trades on an intra-day basis. Trades can last from minutes to hours. Forex Day Trading Systems Swing Trading A style of trading that involves seeking to profit from short to medium term swings in trend. Trades can last from hours to days. Carry Trading A style of trading whereby the trader attempts to profit from holding a currency with a higher rate of interest and selling a currency with a lower rate of interest, profiting from the daily interest rate differential of the position. Position Trading A style of trading that involves taking a longer term position that reflects a longer term outlook. Trades can last from weeks to months. Discretionary Trading A style of trading that uses human judgement and decision making in every trade. Managed Discretionary Accounts Automated Trading A style of trading that involves neither human decision making nor involvement, but uses a pre-programmed strategy based on technical or fundamental analysis to automatically execute trades via an automated software programme. Automated Trading Systems Managed Automated Accounts Example Trade Assume you have a trading account at a broker that requires a 1% margin deposit for every trade. The current quote for EUR/USD is 1.3225/28 and you want to place a market order to buy 1 standard lot of 100,000 Euros at 1.3228, for a total value of US$132,280 (100,000 * $1.3228). The broker requires you to deposit 1% of the total, or $1322.80 to open the trade. At the same time you place a take-profit order at 1.3278, 50 pips above your order price. In taking this trade you expect the Euro to strengthen against the U.S. dollar. As you expected, the Euro strengthens against the U.S. dollar and you take your profit at 1.3278, closing out the trade. As each pip is worth US$10, your total profit for this trade is $500, for a total return of 38%. Required Disclaimer: This example is for illustration only.

How to Calculate FOREX Rollover Rates By Bradley James Bryant, eHow Contributor The forex markets operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Any nation that issues currency can trade its currency against another. Although he market is largely unregulated, there are certain trading conventions to be mindful of as they may also affect your bottom line. One such convention is that all spot trades are settled in two business days. This creates the need to "roll over" accounts. Instructions 1 Review the definition of a rollover. All forex spot trades must be settled within two business days. If you would like to extend your position without settling at the end of each trade day you can close your position by 5 p.m. (EST) on the settlement day and reopen the following trading day. This is referred to as a rollover. Traders do this by using a swap agreement. 2 Review how currency is quoted. Currency is quoted in pairs. The first currency is referred to as the base currency, and the second is referred to as the counter currency. The trader borrows money to purchase another currency. Interest is paid on the borrowed currency and earned on the purchased currency. The net is the rollover interest. 3 Obtain the short-term rate of interest for both the base and counter currency. Go to the treasury department of the issuing nation for current short-term rates. It is usually listed on the home page of the website for the treasury. 4 Work through an example. Let's say you purchase 100,000 CAD/USD at a rate of .9155. The short-term interest rate on the Canadian dollar (base currency) is 4.25 percent, and the short term interest rate on the U.S. dollar (counter currency) is 3.5 percent. 5 Set up the calculation. For the rollover rate, subtract the base currency short- term interest rate from the counter currency interest rate. 6 Find the dollar of the interest. Multiply the number of CAD/USD held by the difference between the CAD short-term interest rate and the USD short-term interest rate. Divide this by the product of the rate at which you purchased CAD/USD and 365. The calculation looks like this: {100,000 x (4.25% - 3.5%)}/(365 x 0.9155) and the answer is $224.40.

Rollover / Prem. Rates Forex Rollover / Premium automatically occurs each evening between 4:58 and 5:06 p.m. EST (Monday through Friday). During this time, users will temporarily be unable to trade. During the rollover period, interest is added to or subtracted from accounts with open positions based on the annual Buy or Sell Premium rates. Daily Premium Formula Volume (in USD) * [ (Premium Rate / 100) / 360 ] Example 100,000 EUR/USD | Premium Rate of -1.83 (100,000*1.3426) * [( -1.83 / 100) / 360] = ($6.82) or (100,000*1.3426) * (-1.83% / 360) = ($6.82) What is Rollover? Rollover interest arises from holding a currency pair overnight, which may result in debit or credit interest posted to an account. Foreign currency trading involves borrowing one currency to buy another whereby the borrowed currency is charged debit interest and the purchased currency is paid interest. The net difference of the two numbers results in a credit or debit interest charge (rollover), if held overnight. "Spot Forex market transactions have a value date that is two business days forward. Rollover involves exchanging the current position for a position expiring the following settlement. Industry practice is if a trade is executed on Tuesday, then Thursday would be considered the value date. An exception occurs if a position is opened and held overnight on Wednesday. The normal value date for Wednesday would be Friday at 5:00 PM ET, however, since the market closes at 5:00 PM ET the value date is extended to the following Monday. Positions that are held overnight on Wednesdays will earn or incur an extra two days of interest (due to the weekend). Additionally, positions with a value date that fall on a holiday also incur or earn additional interest." To avoid rollover interest debits or credits on your positions, simply make sure your position is closed prior to 5pm EST (the established end of the market day). Premium Rates Annual premium rates can be found by adding the "Buy Prem." and "Sell Prem." columns to your Positions or Watchlist windows. http://www.mbtrading.com/i/fxPrem.gif http://www.mbtrading.com/forexRolloverPremRates.aspx

Forex: USD/CHF stretches all-time low to 0.8000 Tue, Jul 26 2011, 06:57 GMT | FXstreet.com Related News Recent trend bias in EUR pairs ForexLive Asian market open Forex: USD worst performer as debt deadlock rages on FXstreet.com (Barcelona) - Given no end in sight to the US debt problem, the USD/CHF is unable to breakout of its broadly bearish trend seen since the opening moments of the week, today extending another 60 pips from the day´s opening price to test support at a fresh record low of 0.8000 just prior to the European session. The FXMarketAlerts team explains: “focus on break of the 0.8000 option barriers - low so far 0.8004-05. Eye any SNB comments and talks of Swiss supranational, options demand. All eyes on ongoing US debt talks for any last ditch deal before Greenback and US Treasuries ditch further, falling into default.” The EUR/CHF on the other hand is faring better today, recovering from a daily low of 1.1517 yesterday to the upside of 1.1600 as attention turns away from the Eurozone debt issues. The pair currently lingers around 1.1625 in wait of fresh direction from the open of the session. Link: http://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-n...2-c40845150a2b

Market Pulse Archives July 26, 2011, 8:36 a.m. EDT Soros to wind down hedge-fund operation: report By Tim Rostan CHICAGO (MarketWatch) -- George Soros, the wartime Hungarian emigre who went on to become not only one of the world's most famed investors and one of the world's richest men but also a prolific author and philanthropist, is hanging up his hedge-fund hat, Bloomberg News reports. The 80-year-old Soros -- whose Soros Fund Management has served as primary adviser to the Quantum hedge funds, established by Soros in 1969 -- is perhaps best known for having "broken" the Bank of England by aggressively, and successfully, betting against the pound in 1992. He made news early this year for having sold the bulk of his firm's stake in gold and silver, having called gold in September 2010 "the ultimate bubble." In a letter expressing gratitude to Soros Fund Management investors, Soros's sons Jonathan and Robert, both executives with the firm, said the firm would return to outside investors their approximately $1 billion in invested cash and continue to operate the business as a family office rather than an investment firm.

Currency Pairs Correlation in Forex Market: Cross Currency Pairs By Vahid | Category: Forex Basics | Tuesday, August 25th, 2009 As a forex trader, if you check several different currency pairs to find the trade setups, you should be aware of the currency pairs correlation, because of two main reasons: 1- You avoid taking the same position with several correlated currency pairs at the same time and so you do not multiply your risk. Additionally, you avoid taking the positions with the currency pairs that move against each other, at the same time. 2- If you know the currency pairs correlations, it may help you to predict the direction and movement of a currency pair, through the signals that you see on the other correlated currency pairs. Now I explain how currency pairs correlation helps. Lets start with the 4 major currency pairs : EUR-USD ; GBP-USD ; USD-JPY and USD-CHF. In both of the first two currency pairs (EUR-USD and GBP-USD), USD works as the money. As you know, the first currency in currency pairs is known as the commodity and the second one is the money. So when you buy EUR-USD , it means you pay USD to buy Euro. In EUR-USD and GBP-USD, the currency that works as the money is the same (USD). The commodity of these pairs are both related to two big European economies. These two currencies are highly connected and related to each other and in 99% of the cases they move on the same direction and form the same buy/sell signals. Just recently, because of the economy crisis, they moved a little differently but their main bias is still the same. What does it mean? It means if EUR-USD shows a buy signal, GBP-USD should also show a buy signal with minor differences in the strength and shape of the signal. If you analyze the market and you come to this conclusion that you should go short with EUR-USD and at the same time you decided to go long with GBP-USD, it means something is wrong with your analysis and one of your analysis is wrong. So you should not take any position until you see the same signal in both of these pairs. Of course, when these pairs really show two different direction (which rarely happens), it will be a signal to trade EUR-GBP. I will tell you how. Accordingly, USD-CHF and USD-JPY behave so similar but not as similar as EUR-USD and GBP-USD, because in USD-CHF and USD-JPY, money is different. Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen have some similarities because both of them belong to oil consumer countries but the volume of industrial trades in Japan, makes JPY different. Generally, when you analyze the four major currency pairs, if you see buy signals in EUR-USD and GBP-USD, you should see sell signals in USD-JPY. If you also see a sell signal in USD-CHF, then your analysis is more reliable. Otherwise, you have to revise and redo your analysis. EUR-USD, GBP-USD, AUD-USD, NZD-USD, GBP-JPY, EUR-JPY, AUD-JPY and NZD-JPY usually have the same direction. Just their movement pattern sometimes becomes more similar to each other and sometimes less. What do I prefer? If I find a sell signal with EUR-USD and GBP-USD and a buy signal with USD-JPY, I prefer to take the short position with one of the EUR-USD or GBP-USD because downward movements are usually stronger. I will not take the short position with EUR-USD or GBP-USD and the long position with USD-JPY at the same time, because if any of these positions goes against me, the other one will do the same. So I don’t double my risk by taking two opposite positions with two currency pairs that move against each other. How to use the currency pairs correlation to predict the direction of the market? When I have a signal with a pair, but I need confirmation to take the position, I refer to the correlated currency pairs or cross currency pairs and look for the confirmation. For example I see a MACD Divergence in USD-CAD four hours chart but there is no close support breakout in USD-CAD four hours or one hour chart. I want to take a short position but I just need a confirmation. If I wait for the confirmation, it can become too late and I may miss the chance. I check a correlated currency pair like USD-SGD and if I see a support breakout in it, I take the short position with USD-CAD. Now the question is why I don’t take the short position with USD-SGD and I use its support breakout to go short with USD-CAD? I do it because USD-CAD movements are stronger and more profitable. I use USD-SGD just as an indicator to trade USD-CAD. It happens that you take a position with a currency pair, but it doesn’t work properly and you don’t know if it was a good decision or not. On the other hand, you don’t see any sharp signal on that currency pair to help you decide if you want to keep the position or close it. In such cases, you can check a correlated currency pair and look for a continuation or reversal signal. It helps you to decide about the position you have. Sometimes, some correlated currency pairs don’t move in the way that they are supposed to move. For example EUR-USD and USD-JPY go up at the same time, whereas they usually move against each other. It can happen when Euro value goes up and USD value doesn’t have a significant change, but at the same time JPY value goes down, because of some reason. In these cases, you can use the below table to find and trade the currency pair that its movement is intensified by an unusual movement in two other currency pairs. In this example, if EUR-USD and USD-JPY go up at the same time, EUR-JPY will go up much stronger (see the below chart). Or if EUR-USD goes up and AUD-USD goes down at the same time, EUR-AUD goes up strongly. Another important example: If EUR-USD goes up and GBP-USD goes down at the same time, EUR-GBP goes up strongly. Maybe this is the most important case that we can trade based on this rule. It happens many times that EUR-USD and GBP-USD move against each other and that is the best time to trade EUR-GBP. Now you know why EUR-GBP doesn’t move strongly most of the time. It is because EUR-USD and GBP-USD move in the same direction most of the time. For example they go up at the same time and so EUR-GBP doesn’t show any significant movement because when both of the currencies of a currency pair go up or down at the same time, that currency pair doesn’t show any strong movement and direction (I hope you know why a currency pair goes up or down. It goes up when the first currency value goes up OR the second currency value goes down. For example EUR-USD goes up, if Euro value goes up or USD value goes down. If this happens at the same time, then EUR-USD goes up much stronger). The below chart includes almost all of these unusual movements and their results on the third currency pair. if EUR-USD http://www.forexoma.com/images/greenarrow.jpg and USD-JPY http://www.forexoma.com/images/greenarrow.jpg then EUR-JPY http://www.forexoma.com/images/greenarrow.jpg http://www.forexoma.com/images/greenarrow.jpg means if EUR-USD and USD-JPY go up at the same time, then EUR-JPY goes up much stronger. http://www.forexoma.com/images/posts...tion-chart.jpg http://www.forexoma.com/currency-pai...urrency-pairs/

Correlation table The following tables represents the correlation between the various parities of the foreign exchange market . The correlation coefficient highlights the similarity of the movements between two parities. If the correlation is high (above 80) and positive then the currencies move in the same way. If the correlation is high (above 80) and negative then the currencies move in the opposite way. If the correlation is low (below 60) then the currencies don't move in the same way.

Currency Correlation Some currencies tend to move in the same direction, some — in opposite. This is a powerful knowledge for those who trade more than one currency pair. It helps to hedge, diversify or double profitable positions. Statistically measured by performance, currency pairs are given so called "correlation coefficients" from +1 to -1. A correlation of +1 means two currency pairs will move in the same direction 100% of the time. A correlation of -1 means they will move in the opposite direction 100% of the time. A correlation of zero means no relation between currency pairs exists. Information about current correlation coefficients can be found here: Currency Correlations Table . [On the page click on FxCorrelations (table version)]. The example of strong positive correlation between two currency pairs is: GBP/USD and EUR/USD. They have a correlation coefficient of over +0.90, which means that when EUR/USD goes up, GBP/USD also goes up. A well known sample of two opposite moving currency pairs is EUR/USD and USD/CHF, they have very high coefficient of over -0.90, which means that they move inversely almost 100% of the time! Examples of same direction moving currency pairs are: EUR/USD and GBP/USD EUR/USD and NZD/USD USD/CHF and USD/JPY AUD/USD and GBP/USD AUD/USD and EUR/USD Inversely moving pairs are: EUR/USD and USD/CHF GBP/USD and USD/JPY GBP/USD and USD/CHF AUD/USD and USD/CAD AUD/USD and USD/JPY How a trader can use this information? 1. A very simple use is avoiding trades that cancel each other. For instance, knowing that EUR/USD and USD/CHF move inversely near-perfectly, there would be no point to go short on both positions as they eventually cancel each other (loss + profit). 1.a. However, there is a strategy of hedging one currency pair with another. Lets' take the same pairs: EUR/USD and USD/CHF. For example, a trader has opened long positions on both currency pairs. Since they move in opposite directions, if EUR/USD is making some losses, the other pair will go in profit. Hence, the total loss will not be as bad as if it would be without the second "backup trade". On the other hand, profits here are not large either. 2. When confident, a trader may double position size by placing same orders on parallel (moving in the same direction) currency pairs. 3. Another option would be to diversify risks in trade. For instance, AUD/USD and EUR/USD pairs have the correlation coefficient of about +0.70 which means that pairs are moving mostly in the same direction but not as perfect (which is what we need here). If we decide that USD is going to weaken, for example, we will go long and place half of buy order on AUD/USD currency pair, and half on EUR/USD. Splitting the orders will preserve trader's positions from sudden losing rallies (sudden "jumps" in price); and as these currencies move not 100% identical a trader will have some time to react adequately. Different monetary policies of different countries' banks also create an impact: when one currency will be less affected than the other and therefore will move slower. Good trades! http://www.forexmarkethours.com/correlation/06/

See # 233 EURUSD, Daily, 2011 July 28 EURUSD, H4, 2011 July 28 EURUSD: Waiting for a breakout or trading the Upward Range at H4? May be the answer could give a view at the Daily Chart. What seems an upward at H4 could be a downward at the Daily. If higher timeframes are more powerful (gives more valide signals) so we should go down, but the market seems reacting extremely choppy at the actual european and american financial and political turmoils. So it seems not the best time for trading longer term time frames. It's seems more the way to hold the long-term-open orders in hedging positions and trade some M1/M5 orders in the meantime. May be something like that or so whereas AUDUSD and AUDCAD seems for me a clear down in the long-term-view.

Example Prolonged Minus Trades EURUSD, H1, 2011 July 28 1.4347 - 1.4287 Profit: + 60 pips Profit: 2'687.90$ Do you have patience ? The first Enter Short (July 25) has turned out a false breakout. May be you could hedge these orders at any stop loss level or exit your minus orders with a loss. I am a friend to hold my minus orders a while longer and will give them the chance to come back in the winning zone. 98% of all minus orders could be come back in the profit zone within 2 days till 1 month. Why? You have make your market analysis before you enter in the market and you trust your market analysis. You can only succeed in doing so otherwise Forextrading isn't something for you! Then you have to manage these opened minus orders in the intervening time. How do I make this? You can hedge these orders several times at different stop loss levels and/or counterbalance them with correlated currency-pairs, moreover you can make more trades at smaller time frames ad interim or less trades with higher lot sizes and/or you can go in the market on several occasions at higher time cells. Rule-of-thumb Ratio 1:10 (Profit Per Day/Deposit) - in this Example: Profit per Currency Pair/Deposit) There was make a profit about 2'700.-$ so the account deposits have to be ten times more (~27'000.-$) by Depot Managing.

Online forex articles Understanding Bearish Candlestick Charting for the Forex Trading Market A Bearish market happens when prices for the online Forex market are declining. In bearish candle charting we try to foresee when the market will drop. The Shooting Star The shooting star is a bearish signal that can be identified by the following characteristics: It has an upward trend preceding the shooting star. It consists of a candle line with a long upper shadow, and a small red or green upper body. The line either has a very small lower shadow, or has no shadow at all. After noticing a shooting star, you can expect a bearish market to appear. The Bearish Engulfing Pattern This pattern is recognizable when you notice a long red body that follows a small green body, and engulfs it. This pattern can point to the fact that the bullish trend has tired, and that a bearish trend is nearing. The Dark Cloud Cover This reversal pattern consists of two candle lines. The first candle line of the dark cloud cover is a line with a long green body. The second line opens above the previous candle's high price. The closing price for the second candle line is close to the market's low point, and it is also within the range of the prior candle line's green body. The Evening Star This is a top reversal pattern, made out of three candle lines, and is the opposite of the bullish morning star. The evening star occurs when there is a bullish market. This is followed by a long green candle. Then appears a small real body of red or green color, which is out of the range of the previous green body. The third candle has a red body that closes inside the range of the first candle. Windows in Candlestick Charts The window is similar to the gap in bar charts. There could be rising windows or falling windows. A rising window occurs when the top of the previous upper shadow is lower than the next lower shadow. A Falling window occurs when the previous low shadow is above the top of the next candle's upper shadow. both types of windows suggest that the market may have exhausted its rising/falling trend, and is going to change direction.

Window - Falling and Rising (Forex Education) By Al Parsai | August 27, 2010 6:37 AM EST What is a Window? Most of candlestick patterns are considered reversal. There are some patterns that usually imply continuation of the trend. Falling and Rising Window formations are among them. We could also consider three white soldiers, falling three methods, rising three methods, and separating lines as other candlestick continuation patterns. The window formation is similar to gap formations in bar charts. They basically mean that there is a price gap between two consecutive candles. Window formations fall into falling and rising categories. Such formations usually appear when the market opens after weekends or when a surprising news release suddenly pushes the market in one direction. The Rising Window Candle Pattern This pattern takes shape when the low of the current candle is higher than the high of the previous candle (see image). You may see such windows in daily charts, intraday charts, or even weekly and monthly charts. http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto...ng_windows.png The size of the gap could be one pip or several pips. The window is valid only if there is a gap between highs and lows not the real body of the candles. We consider this formation as a bullish pattern. We expect to see an increase in the price or rather a rally when the formation appears on a chart. Although it is said that gaps are eventually filled this could take a long time so you can benefit from the current movement in your favour. To be on the safe side consider this. The window or rather the gap between the high of the last session and the low of the current session acts like a support zone. If the future candles manage to penetrate this zone but they do not close there then you could consider the window pattern still in control (i.e. a bullish move). However, if a future candle closes in the support zone and especially below the critical support line then you may expect a reversal in the market direction. The critical support line passes through the lowest point of the window. Remember that "Technical Analysis" is more of an art than a science, so none of these rules are set in stone. As a general rule of thumb, a quick closure in or especially below the support zone makes the window invalid. If the window appears in the middle of a strong uptrend then it is usually more reliable. If you are dealing with more than one rising windows in an uptrend then you could consider the trend reversed when all the support zones are breeched. As an alternative method you may consider the third window a sign of reversal in the trend. I personally suggest being more careful with trading consecutive rising windows. The Falling Window Candle Pattern Falling window appears when the high of the current candle is lower than the low of the previous candle. This formation has many similarities with the rising window but with bearish implications (see image). http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto...ng_windows.png Falling window is a bearish formation. It defines a resistance zone. If future candles do not close in the resistance zone especially above the critical resistance line then this bearish effect remains valid. I have personally seen more falling windows in the forex market than rising windows. You may use other technical tools such as Fibonacci Retracement or Expansion to locate your profit target but if you enter a trade with this tool I personally suggest placing your stop loss at the critical resistance line or a few pips above it. A more flexible approach is to place SL through the high of the first candle. It could help you deal with whipsaws. Locating Window Formations in a Chart Locating windows in a chart was the easiest task I had as a programmer. All I needed to do was to locate gaps. I consider a gap valid if it is at least one pip high (see image). http://www.forexbrace.com/images/sto...le_windows.png The up-arrows or down-arrows appear on the second candle. I also encourage you to consider the recent trend or market movements and also other technical tools prior to trading window formations. http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/46539...ding-mql-m.htm

Bulkowski’s Rising Window In my book, Encyclopedia of Candlestick Charts http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=b...1&amp;a=0470182016 , pictured on the right, I explore the entire range of candlestick patterns from abandoned babies to windows (not exactly A to Z, but you get the idea), in both bull and bear markets, using almost 5 million candle lines in the tests. The book takes an in-depth look at 103 candlestick patterns and reports on behavior and rank (3 types: reversal rate, frequency, and overall performance), identification guidelines, performance statistics (tables of general statistics, height, and volume), trading tactics (tables of statistics on reversal rates and performance indicators), and wraps each chapter with a sample trade. I share a sliver of that information below. If you like what you read here, then you will love the book. Help support this website and buy a copy by clicking on the above link. The rising window is a fancy name for a price gap in an upward price trend. It occurs when yesterday’s high is below today’s low, leaving a hole on the daily price chart. The pattern appears in a rising price trend, and it acts as a bullish continuation pattern. Rising windows occur often, so you will find them on the charts, but the longer the time scale, the more difficult it is to find one. Important Results Theoretical performance: Bullish continuation Tested performance: Bullish continuation 75% of the time Stopped in gap: 20% Frequency rank: 20 Overall performance rank: 42 Average time to gap closed: 79 days Median time to gap closed: 11 days http://thepatternsite.com/images/RiseWindow.JPG Rising Window Discussion As I mentioned in the introduction, the rising window is a space left on the price chart. On the daily chart, a surprisingly good earnings announcement or other corporate event can create a gap. The rising window acts as a bullish continuation pattern 75% of the time, which is very good. The overall performance rank is 42, but that really measures the price trend surrounding the rising window and not the window itself. One of the more interesting statistics from Important Results is the stopped in gap number. For a rising window, this is the percentage of time that a minor low appeared within the gap before price closed the gap. In other words, a gap showed underlying support 20% of the time. The average time to close the gap is 79 days, but the median is 11 days. Closing the gap means price retraces far enough to cover the gap. If price gaps from $1 to $1.50, then price would have to drop back to $1 to close the gap. The large difference between the two numbers, 79 and 11, is because the average has some gaps which take a long time to close, pulling the average upward. The median just splits the list in two and reports on the middle number. Identification Guidelines Characteristic Discussion Number of candle linesTwo. Price trend leading to the patternUpward. ConfigurationFind a pattern in which yesterday’s high is below today’s low. Example http://thepatternsite.com/Candles/Windows.JPG The chart of 3M shows many different windows, some rising and some falling. A falling window will appear in a downward price trend, such as that shown at point A . The day after the white candle, price gaps open lower and struggles to close the gap throughout the day, but cannot do it. A hole remains on the chart. The other points, B , C , and D , are all gaps called rising windows. Those have a high price on one day that remains below the low of the next day, leaving a hole on the chart. One of the secrets to rising and falling windows is to determine the gap type. Rising window B , for example, is a breakaway gap because it breaks away from the small congestion area. C is an exhaustion gap because the price trend ends soon after. Point D is an area or common gap because price closes that gap shortly after it appears. What type of gap is falling window A ? Since price is trending lower, it is probably an exhaustion gap and not an area gap. See Also Review the performance of gaps. The results may surprise you! A falling window has a downward gap. Here is an exciting use of gaps for trading. This discusses a gap trading setup from the short side. If you prefer candlesticks, then visit over 100 of them in the alphabetical index.

Golden Cross http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg What Does Golden Cross Mean? A crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as 50-day moving average) or resistance level. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/dictio...oldenCross.gif http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg Investopedia explains Golden Cross As long-term indicators carry more weight, the Golden Cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes. Additionally, the long-term moving average becomes the new support level in the rising market. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp

Forex Investing: How To Use The Golden Cross Posted: May 13, 2011 Plenty of currency traders know about the golden cross , but most don't use it. In fact, the golden cross is one of those technical formations that just doesn't get enough credit in the analysis world. Used correctly, however, the golden cross can be one of the best indicators of a turn in foreign exchange market trends. Read more: http://www.investopedia.com/articles...#ixzz1ToBm7eLr What Is a Golden Cross? A golden cross is simply a bullish technical formation that supports upward momentum in a current trend or a potential turnaround in a downtrending market. This formation typically stems from a cross of moving average lines or different signal lines in certain technical oscillators - like Slow Stochastics or MACD (moving average convergence divergence oscillator). To use a golden cross, a trader simply needs to identify the shorter-term moving average or signal line rising above the longer-term component. As current or short-term prices move higher, the shorter-term component will naturally rise above average prices over the longer term. This will help to support even higher prices in the near term as trend momentum builds. Let's take a look at a typical golden cross formation.

What is a liquidity squeeze? A liquidity squeeze occurs when a financial event sparks concerns among financial institutions (such as banks) regarding the short-term availability of money. These concerns may cause banks to be more reluctant to lend out money within the interbank market . As a result, banks will often impose higher lending requirements in an effort to hold onto their cash reserves. This cash hoarding will cause the overnight borrowing rate to spike significantly above its benchmark rate and, as a result, the cost of borrowing will increase. In the face of higher interest rates, individual investors will often liquidate their holdings in riskier investments. This mass liquidation of investments puts a further strain on the amount cash available to financial institutions. If left unchecked, a liquidity squeeze could result in a scenario in which banks make it extremely difficult for all but individuals with the best credit scores to get a loan. Furthermore, mutual funds and hedge funds might also restrict investor withdrawals. For example, a liquidity squeeze occurred as a result of the subprime meltdown that took place at the beginning of 2007. Essentially, low interest rates, banks' lax lending practices, the U.S. housing bubble from 2001-2005 and a dramatic increase in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) with a high concentration in subprime mortgages set the stage for the liquidity squeeze that ensued. Housing prices crashed in August of 2006, fueling a drastic increase in the number of foreclosures. The consequences of this increase in foreclosures reverberated through to the lenders, hedge funds and investors, which collectively lost billions of dollars. As a result, banks began to hold onto their reserves more tightly, causing the U.S. interbank rate to jump drastically. Furthermore, investors put more pressure on capital liquidity as they withdrew funds from hedge funds and other investments that held subprime mortgage assets. (For more on how this happened, read The Fuel That Fed The Subprime Meltdown .) Ultimately, the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank and other central banks stepped in August of 2007 and attempted to rectify the situation by injecting billions of dollars into various money markets in an attempt to increase liquidity and stabilize foreign exchange rates.

7.8 More Continuation Patterns Triangle patterns are usually characteristic of a trend consolidation followed by an accelerated break out of the pattern in the direction of the continuing trend. Triangles form in three basic categories: symmetrical , ascending and descending . A variant of the triangle pattern is the wedge . http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph...riangle-78.gif Symmetrical Triangle http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph...angle-78-2.gif A symmetrical triangle is indicative of a period of consolidation during an uptrend or a downtrend. The symmetrical triangle has a line of support that slopes upwards and a line of resistance that slopes downward. The triangle pattern yields to a breakout in the direction that corresponds with the trend beforehand, though not always. http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph...riangle-78.gif Ascending Triangle http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph...angle-78-2.gif An ascending triangle is indicative of a period of consolidation during an uptrend. It is formed when price action moves between a line of resistance that is relatively flat or horizontal and a line of support that is sloping upwards. http://www.cmsfx.com/en/forex-educat...angles-wedges/

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Follow-up As the two lines converge the chance of a break out increases. When price moves strongly above the line of resistance the pattern ends. On the right is a daily chart showing an uptrend that consolidates for almost a month in an ascending triangle pattern. http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph...riangle-78.gif Descending Triangle http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph...angle-78-2.gif A descending triangle is indicative of a period of consolidation during a down trend. It is formed when price action moves between a line of resistance that is sloping downwards and a line of support that is relatively flat or horizontal. As the two lines converge the chance of a break out increases. When price moves strongly below the line of support the pattern ends and the downtrend continues. A real life example is shown to the right. http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph..._wedges-78.gif Wedges The wedge pattern shares most of its characteristics with the symmetrical triangle and the flag. The wedge forms much like the triangle and signifies a sharp expected breakout in the direction of the prevailing trend. Much like the flag, however, the wedge itself forms at an inclination opposite to the direction of the trend before breaking out in the direction of the prevailing trend. http://www.cmsfx.com/en/forex-educat...angles-wedges/

Descending Triangle Chart Patterns in Forex PROFITING WITH CHART PATTERNS: THE DESCENDING TRIANGLE A descending triangle chart pattern is formed by the convergence of a horizontal lower trend line (which forms the base of the triangle) and a downward sloping upper trend line. The trend lines are so formed because the sloping upper trend lines mark the highs of the candlesticks which are gradually getting lower, and the horizontal trend lines signifies an area of support. This descending triangle chart pattern is a bearish pattern, as the lower highs signify that the upside pressure on the price action of the currency pair is waning, and the gradual pressure on the horizontal support that this produces will soon lead to a massive downward breakout. There are two ways to trade this pattern. 1) Trading the range In this case, after plotting the trend lines, you will see the candlesticks trading within the range of the downward sloping upper trend line and the horizontal trend line. In this case, it is safer to place a sell when the candlestick has closed at the upper trend line. Place a sell order at the open of the next candlestick, because this will be a bearish candle. See the chart below. http://www.exotrader.com/wp-content/...Capture210.jpg 2) Trading the bearish breakout This is the classical descending triangle trade setup. You can place a Sell Stop about 15 pips below the base of the triangle. Do not wait until the convergence of the two trend lines is almost complete as you may be too late to catch the breakout that would almost certainly have occurred. http://www.exotrader.com/wp-content/...Capture211.jpg This particular trade was good for 100 pips if you used method 1, or 65 pips if you used method 2. In the next article, I will put up a descending triangle setup which is set to produce a bearish move on the GBPUSD for next week, baring any fundamental surprises. Look out for it. http://www.exotrader.com/index.php/2...erns-in-forex/

Forex Trading Trend Patterns - The Symmetrical Triangle A symmetrical triangle is a Forex trading continuation pattern that occurs in the middle of an uptrend or a downtrend is already in progress. ...we will teach you the steps needed to recognize symmetrical triangles : - First, a symmetrical triangle starts with a change in the direction of currency price. If the currency followed an uptrend then the triangle will start to drop. - Next, the currency rapidly changes direction, with steep rises and drops. Which makes a symmetrical triangle is that the rises and drops become shorter and shorter, thus forming a sort of triangle. The currency price start with large rises and drops, and converges into a point, that is also the tip of the triangle. After the tip of the triangle is formed, the Forex trading trend that preceded the symmetrical triangle is continued. This is why it is called a Forex trading continuation pattern. If you draw two lines on the edges of the rapid rises and drops, they will form a symmetrical triangle with the same sides, which is also names am Isosceles. http://www.forexfloor.com/symmetrical-triangles.html

But what is Triangle Forex Arbitrage Strategie? Triangle Forex Arbitrage Strategy Tuesday, March 11, 2008 Triangle or triangular arbitrage is a Forex trading strategy, which is theoretically ‘risk free’. As the name suggest, triangle arbitrage includes trading 3 different currency pairs almost simultaneously to profit from exchange rate difference between them. In global Forex market, the price of one currency pair depends on the price of one or more other currency pairs. The basic formula for the relationship of three related currency pairs, having 3 different currencies, is as follows. AAA/BBB x CCC/AAA = CCC/BBB Chance of triangular arbitrage occurs whenever this equation goes wrong. A triangle arbitrator buys BBB spending AAA, then buys CCC spending BBB and lastly returns to AAA selling CCC, capturing a small profit. The chance of profit is maximized by utilizing margin from brokers and trading with higher amounts. For example take exchange rates EUR/USD = 0.6522, EUR/GBP = 1.3127 and USD/GBP = 2.0129. With $500,000 one can buy 326100 Euros, using that he can buy 248419.29 Pounds. He can now sell the pounds for $500043.19. Thus he can earn a profit of $43.19. In today’s Forex market, the chances for triangle arbitrage are getting rare. Even if there is one, it last only for seconds. Thus for profiting from triangular arbitrage traders need advanced trading systems, programmed for automated trading. Taxes and fees may also reduce the profit. http://blog.nobletrading.com/2008/03...-strategy.html

Geithner Rips S&amp;P for 'Really Terrible' Move on Downgrade Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ripped Standard &amp; Poor's two days after the ratings agency downgraded US debt, saying the stunning move was based on a "lack of knowledge" about the nation's finances. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner Geithner also said the debt crisis presents Congress with a chance to "earn back confidence of investors around the world" and he reiterated his support for President Obama, who asked Geithner to stay on even as calls intensified over the weekend for his resignation. "S&amp;P has shown really terrible judgment and they've handled themselves very poorly," he said in an exclusive interview with CNBC. "And they've shown a stunning lack of knowledge about basic U.S. fiscal budget math. And I think they drew exactly the wrong conclusion from this budget agreement." As he spoke, US stock futures indicated a sharply lower open for Wall Street as investors reacted to the move by S&amp;P to strip the US of its coveted AAA credit rating. However, Geithner said investors should continue to have full faith in US debt. "The judgment by S&amp;P changed nothing. It added nothing to what people know about this country," Geithner said. "Again, there's no risk the U.S. would never meet its obligations. We've got some challenges ahead of us, but we'll be able to work with those challenges. We'll get through this." Yet even as he criticized S&amp;P he acknowledged that public finances are in poor condition. "There's no surprise that the U.S. has a long-term and unsustainable fiscal position," he said. "We believe that. The president believes that. That's why he's been fighting so hard to bring people together to try to deal with it. He spoke amid fierce rancor in Washington. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) called the situation a "tea party downgrade," while Rep. Michelle Bachman, the tea party favorite from Minnesota and Republican presidential candidate, called on Obama to fire Geithner. "I'm not going to do politics," Geithner said. "I think if we've learned anything these last few months it's it's time to put the economy ahead of politics. Again, these are challenges facing the country of the United States, not facing one party or the other. We both have some responsibility for coming together to dig our way out of this stuff." http://www.cnbc.com/id/44053113
