Hi all and welcome to the DAILY95PIPS strategy.

Before we start I urge you to paper trade any new strategy including this one before committing any of your own funds. Thorough testing is crucial before taking any strategy live.

Also bear in mind that this system is by no means new and may look familiar to some of you. I am simply passing it on from my predecessors/mentors in the hope that it adds to your existing trading arsenal and increases your trading results.

The basis of this system is VERY simple and has proven to be profitable, though I am adjusting the money management/profit targets. So results for this revised version will be realised on this thread. I must also emphasise the well known phrase that "past performance is no guarantee of future returns".

I will add the daily trading results to this thread as we go along. See post#1602 for updated results for the current week. Weekly and individual pairs results are at post #1602. Monthly totals are at post#1602. (Please disregard the next post #2 as I am unable to add to it.)

That being said, let us proceed with the strategy.

OVERVIEW:

This is a pure "set and forget" system where trades are placed at the same time everyday. The option is also there for those inclined to monitor their positions to adjust stop levels as profit targets are reached. Please note that there is currently an Expert Advisor being developed that automates the trading of this strategy, thus keeping to the set and forget objective. Please click on the paperclip at the top right hand side of the page to find the current versions. For those new to using Expert Advisors you will need a broker that uses an MT4 platform such as North Finance, IBFX, ODL, FXDD to name a few. For instruction on installing EA's go to: http://www.halcyonfx.com/howtoinstall.htm

By setting multiple profit targets we are exercising money management, while aiming for 95pips profit from a 50pip move in price.

We will simply be placing orders 5pips above the previous days HIGH and 5pips below the previous days LOW.(Actually, it's more like the previous 17hrs at 5pm EST.)

Use a 30pip stop loss for all orders.

Orders are placed on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

EXECUTION:

1.) At 5pm EST open the 1hr chart (2hrs b4 start of the Asian session) of USDJPY. ( In an attempt to pre-empt questions about how this strategy works on other pairs, I will post results comparing GBPUSD, GBPJPY, EURJPY, and EURUSD. You're welcome to add to the list.)

For those who need help with converting timezones go to: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html

For those whose brokers spreads are still wide at 5pm EST on Sunday (which is 7am my time on a Monday here in Brisbane), in order to avoid the wide spreads you may need to wait until they reduce to normal before placing the orders for the day. I typically have to wait until around 8pm EST for Oanda's spreads to reduce back to normal.

2.) Use the high and low of the previous 17hrs. For Mondays orders go back as far as 00:00 EST on Friday for high and low.

3.) Open a total of 6 PENDING orders (for each pair) including 3 BUY STOPS and 3 SELL STOPS that expire within 24hrs (I use 18hrs) as follows:

Buy/Long Orders:

i. #1 - Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=15pips, S/L=30pips

ii. #2 - Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=30pips, S/L=30pips

iii. #3 - Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=50pips, S/L=30pips

Sell/Short Orders:

i. #1 - Entry = LOW-5pips, Take Profit=15pips, S/L=30pips

ii. #2 - Entry = LOW-5pips, Take Profit=30pips, S/L=30pips

iii. #3 - Entry = LOW-5pips, Take Profit=50pips, S/L=30pips

That's it.

Once you have placed your orders you are free to go and do something else with your day as this strategy does not require you to be monitoring the trades. Though, as already mentioned, to maximise results you may choose to adjust stop levels when profit targets are reached which by the way is automatically done by the EA.

There can be 4 possible outcomes after either the long or short trades are triggered:

1.) All 3 profit targets are reached for a total of +95pips.

2.) The first 2 profit targets are reached (+45pips) and the remaining lot is stopped out (-30pips) leaving a total of +15pips.

3.) The first profit target is reached (+15pips) and the two remaining lots are stopped out for a total of -45pips.

4.) All 3 lots are stopped out for a total of -90pips.

Additional to this is the variable outcomes of when both the long and short trades are triggered.

Also note that for those so inclined to monitor the trades, stop levels may be adjusted on remaining lot/s to protect already achieved profits. Trailing stops may also be used at your discretion. These features are included in the EA.

Please note that as a general rule of thumb you should not risk any more than 3% of your trading account on any one trade.

Therefore, with the DAILY95PIPS strategy the order size will need to be divided between the long and short orders. The total potential loss on the long orders (90pips) will therefore add up to 3% of your trading account.

Alternatively, you could risk 3% of your trading capital on EACH order, totalling 9% of your trading capital being risked for the long trades. The same applies to the short orders.

Happy trading everyone !

Mike,

Thanks for posting this. It looks interesting.

I have a question-

They are placed at 7PM EST. I don't think any broker is open at 7PM EST on Fridays. Did you mean 7PM EST on Thursday for Friday?

The same for Sunday- Would we open orders Sunday at 7PM EST for Monday?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #4 ---
If the buy orders get triggered do you cancel the sell orders and visa versa

Thanks,

Billser

EDIT: What do you do about the Sunday Candle...do you treat it as a seperate day or add it to the friday candle...

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi Bill and thanks for the questions

With this strategy we are basically using the previous days HIGH and LOW.

Therefore, Monday's orders would be based on the high and low of the previous Friday (unless there has been unusually high activity over the weekend, in which case you could use Sunday's data).

Correct...Friday's orders are based on Thursday's high and low.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I personally leave both orders open until they cancel. I set the expiry of the orders at 18hrs. This does leave open the possibility of BOTH trades being triggered.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Do you have any thoughts on the EUR/JPY pair with regards to SL TP. Thanks for the thread

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks for the question Bill.

Yes, I am currently also paper trading the same strategy on numerous currency pairs ( USDJPY, GBPJPY, EURJPY, GBPUSD, EURUSD.)

I've also edited the original post indicating that I will compare results between these pairs.

I've used the same SL and TP for all. If you have the means to determine optimal SL and TP by all means do so and let us know.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
this might be a good strategy for those ranging times...and possibly the EUR/GBP....

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hello, what have been the past results of our mentors.  This seems pretty mechanical?  Thank you in advance...Joe

--- 帖子 #11 ---
based on observation. today, it would have been a nice +95 pip.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
???? which pair....not much movement on a sunday afternoon...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
GBP/JPY ~100 pip up............ from last week high.....

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Good idea John...EURGBP may also be a pipfactory for this strategy.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Yes Joe, this is a VERY mechanical system...the advantage of this is that 99.9% of emotion can be removed from the trading process, and that's the great thing about a set and forget strategy.

In terms of past results, I have seen versions of this strategy that aim for profits of 60pips from a 30pip move in price, risking 90pips. The average monthly result is approx. 300pips.

The basis of this system is the same ie. placing limit orders 5pips above and below the previous days high and low, however I have introduced a variation on the money management strategy which involves aiming for 95pips while risking 90pips. Therefore, I do not have any historical results to share with you at this point in time...sorry 'bout that. The results of this new approach are being forward tested and posted on this thread.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
just have to adjust for the smaller price fluctuations......appears the daily average is only 25 pip or so....

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I have tested this strategy on USD/JPY and the profit for 15 and 30 pips are closed.

The 50 pips position is still open, hovering between the PL.

By the way, can you give me the PL and SL settings for other pair of currency?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
My Broker is IBFX and their new daily candles starts at 8.00 EST. Is that going to make an difference to placing the trade. In your first post you said that you place a new trade at 5.00 EST

Thanks

Billser

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Billser,

FXDD starts their day at 5PM EST.

If you wanted to you could download their platform on a demo, for their charts.

They also don't have the short Sunday candle to worry about.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
It's seems that I am unable to edit the above post, so results may need to be given on separate posts as we go along.

The first day's results are posted here. It was a very mediocre day due to low volatility in the market, highly attributed to the Bank Holiday in the UK.

Date: Monday 27 August 2007

GBPUSD        GBPJPY        USDJPY        EURJPY        EURGBP        EURUSD

+15pips       +15pips        -45pips        +15pips        no touch      no touch

Happy pipping !

Ok. I'll try to get more organised with the results. As i can edit this post (unlike post#2), I hope to add all future results here. I'll also add daily comments, serving the purpose of a trading journal.

Date:               Tuesday 28 August 2007

GBPUSD          + 95

GBPJPY  +95

USDJPY  +95

EURJPY  +15

EURGBP  +23

EURUSD   -90

Comment: A good day overall. EURJPY came within 2pips of the 50 profit target. EURGBP 15pips PT was reached and the other 2 lots were closed out manually before new orders were placed for the next day.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
What SL and TP do you use on the below pairs. USD/JPY we know.

Tonights trades on USD/JPY I have 2 of the 3 trades closed out already and the last one just missed by 4 pips as of 10.42 Est

Thanks

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Ahh, maybe the timing ?

I tested with +95 profit yesterday.....right after Asian open time at GBP JPY

today also +95 pip also with asian open time....

--- 帖子 #23 ---
What SL did you use for G/J

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #24 ---
use mikelath system on post #1

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Do you mean 300 pips  for every pair traded?

for the GBP/US and EUR/US can you  begin at the Londen session opening?

any special reason why it has to be Tokyo opening?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Syafi.

Another consideration for varied results is that price tends to vary a little from one broker to another, and that can sometimes mean the difference between a profit target being reached or not.

cheers

mike

--- 帖子 #27 ---
hi Mike

Thank you for sharing the system.

I am new in forex. currently using metatrader which seems using gmt +2.

is it okay for me to used their chart?

thank you

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi vanupips.

Good questions.

I have only ever been aware of a similar version of this strategy being traded on GBPUSD, where results were an average of +300pips per month. Not bad considering the amount of effort involved...there are NO indicators, practically NO variables that may distort one's decisions...just a basic 10minutes per day set and forget strategy.

I'm just comparing numerous pairs on this thread because the question often comes up as to whether a strategy works with other pairs or not....so to pre-empt such question I've included more pairs...this will also help us clearly see which pairs (out of those included) work best.

Regarding the time of placing the orders....quite frankly, I'll admit that I don't know the reason....you're welcome to do your own forward (or backtesting) based on entry at other times of the day.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
The Asian session starts at 7:00 PM EST, not 5:00 PM.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I collected +95 pips on the USD/JPY today with this method.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Mike ,

Maybe you can ask those who know how to do it to make a backtest on different pairs using different opening times?

(Would have done it if I had know how to)

Do you keep the open positions till you hit the TP or SL or do you close it all when you open new position next day?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
There is no 100% system....

This system will lose 2 days out of 5 days in a week  ...

ensure you can withstand 180 pip losing.. in a week...

in a month it will give you ~300 pip profit ......

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Do you clear out the previous days orders and close all open orders prior to entering in the new orders for the day?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
95 pips per day x 20 days per month = 1900 possible pips.

If it gives you 300 pips per month then what happened to the rest of the 1600 pips. That tells me there must be a lot of negitive days.

I'm not trying to be negitive, Just trying to see the big picture and what to expect during the month.

Any thoughts any one.

Billser

--- 帖子 #35 ---
The results we are working with are vague, at best.

A winning day doesn't have to be +95 pips.

A losing day doesn't have to be -90 pips.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
5pm est is the close of NY session and close of fx day

--- 帖子 #37 ---
So is 5.00 EST the correct time to place the new trade for the day.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Is there anyone who knows how to make backtests?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
it could go first 10 pips up , then down and back up, and you end up losing 180 pips a day , after 3 days in a choppy market you lost more then 500 pips, this is also a possibility

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Not with the rules as presented.

You enter a max of three trades. The SL on each trade is 30.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
the rule is "you enter a total of 6 trades, 3 buy's and 3 sell's"

if you are not lucky they all got triggered  you lost 180 pips.

3 unlucky days ......

--- 帖子 #42 ---
You're right. I stand corrected.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
So I back tested this one week. I went off previous days highs and lows like instructed. I used Euro/usd. My numbers are based on closing out the days trades before entering in new trades for the current day. The following is the net pips in 24 hours.

8/20 -0

8/21 -123

8/22 +67

8/23 +15

8/24 +95

8/27 +95

Giving you a total of 149 pips for the week. If you don't close out the trades by days end and let them run their course you might save pips? Comments?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
might want to think about only loosing 3 trades in a row then stopping for the day

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks for the correction marcf.

I'll edit post #1 to "2hrs before the start of the Asian session".

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hey vanupips, keep those quality questions coming.

I'm not really into backtesting. I prefer to forward test on a demo account before going live on a new strategy. I can then experience the mechanics of trading the strategy to firstly see if I'm comfortable with it and secondly to see if it brings the pips !:

Yes, I only keep the positions open till they hit TP or SL within that trading day, and will close out any positions that are still open before placing the orders for the next day. I had that experience today...the EURGBP position was still open. It had already achieved the +15pip TP. I closed the other 2 lots for +4pips each, so the total for the day was +23pips.

cheers

mike

Hi yusho.

We need to bear in mind that prices can vary with different brokers, though they all must follow the general direction of price in order to keep the credibility with their clientelle !

So, in my opinion, it's ok to use the broker ( and charts ) of your choice, however just bear in mind that the above mentioned fluctuations may determine the difference between times when TP or SL levels are reached or not. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
You can take the high and low for the past 24 hours, at 5PM EST, regardless of the time used by your broker. You can place your orders then. That's what I do.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hey billbss.

Thanks for your interest.

As mentioned in a previous post, those +300pips were an average on GBPUSD only...using profit targets of 10,20 and 30pips..thus risking 90pips to make 60pips...this new strategy's profit targets are different, so we all need to be patient to see what the forward testing results will be.

You're absolutey right regarding possible outcomes...as mentioned in post#1, there can be at least 4 of them....

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Good point billbss.

I do the same. I actually used to place the orders at 7pm EST, which is when the new daily candle opens (with my broker). Though another strategy I trade requires the orders to be placed after 5pm EST, so I found myself placing them both around the same time...or rather between 5-7pm EST.

I think a relevant point is that any strategy is a guideline to a consistent approach to trading the market. In my opinion, it's better for someone to get into the routine of placing their orders at the same time each day. In this case, we are actually placing our orders before the new daily candle opens, simply using, as you stated, the previous 24hrs (or 22hrs) data.

I hope this doesn't confuse anyone.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I'm up 91 pips in 2 days.....I let the first TP run out naturally then I get chicken and bug out with another 12+ pips for the other 2 TP.. On my demo I let it run until it hits it's TP...so far so good.

Anyone thought about trading an extra lot but this time using a trailing stop of 30+

Billser

3rd day another +95 pip on Asian open time with GBP JPY

since its the 3rd consecutive good trade, with 285 pip we can all go holiday to Greece. err its haze there, so we go Casablanca......

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Do you place your trade at 5.00pm EST and is your SL still 30 pips same as U/J.

Are you demo or real money?

Thanks and congrats

--- 帖子 #55 ---
If you can buy ticket to Casablanca with demo money then its good  for you.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
how do  i get your currency pair for each day and the target pls am new in this stuff.

more help help is apprecited

--- 帖子 #57 ---
im up 190 pips on the euro/usd....for today unless the Euro makes a run above 1.3685 i will have a 90 pip loss. Last night the euro dropped just low enough for by sell orders to kick in and then the stopped out at 1.3600. Still 100 pips in 2 days isn't bad. I have back tested this 2 months just for kicks and show a would be gain of 590 pips on the Euro/usd. Not too shabby! Does anyone have an opinion on what might be the best currency pair to trade?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You reckon I am being lazy here... can anyone write an EA for this?

Lol... no I'm serious.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi. I'm not really sure that I understand your question, however I suggest that you carefully read post #1.

We are placing BOTH buy AND sell orders each day.

I hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Greetings all.

Yesterday was an interesting one, with both long and short orders being triggered on most of the pairs I'm comparing except EURUSD and EURGBP.

Depending on the broker used and the time of entering the orders, results may vary somewhat amongst us. That's ok...overall the results are still looking good.

Please refer to post#61 for updated results.

Happy pipping.

GBPUSD -180

GBPJPY  -30

USDJPY +105

EURJPY +190

EURGBP +15

EURUSD +95

Total:  +195pips

Comment: A very interesting day. GBPUSD and GBPJPY were triggered and stopped out soon after placing the orders. Both the long and short orders were triggered on numerous pairs...some for the better, some not so. Closed out 2 lots on EURGBP at breakeven to make way for new orders. Overall, another good result.

Date: Thursday 30 August

GBPUSD  -90

GBPJPY  no touch

USDJPY  no touch

EURJPY  no touch

EURGBP  no touch

EURUSD  no touch

Total: -90pips

Comment: As we can see it was a pretty uneventful day. The long trade on GBPUSD was the only one that triggered. All others traded within the range of the previous days high and low. It happens. We can't expect a breakout every single day. Patience and sticking with the system is the key.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Not to bad for a days work..  What have you determined as the TPs and SLs for the differant pairs?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
mike,

how are you plus 95 on the Euro/usd? I took the high and low from yesterday which was 1.3680 and 1.3575. that would make my entry on the buy at 1.3685 and my entry on the sell at 1.3570. My 3 sell orders kicked in and gained 8 pips before reversing and stopping out at 1.3600. and my buy order never kicked in. My broker ends the current day at 8pm eastern time. How do your entry's compare to mine? Im just wondering if im missing something?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
i was looking at the strategy..i was thinking instead of giving only 10pips from the buy and sell..why not give more pips in between so that you won't get buy and sell trigger at the same time.

example

yesterday high +15pips

yesterday low -15 pips

that way, when you get stop out, you also are in short position.

comments?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi slappy.

What time did you place your orders?

As stated numerous times on previous posts, varied results will occur with different brokers and entry times.

I hope that clarifies your enquiry.

I placed mine @ 8pm EST also , Im just waiting for new daily candle to open.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Midnight EST

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I think the best would be discarding what time new day start with your broker. Rather,

START at forex Start day .......  (5.00.01) US EST ....

forex day start after US close...

Thank Youhttp://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Looks like long orders might get triggered, we'll see.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
This is the best idea, you have high and low of the day place your orders at 5pm est that is 10pm uk time and 9pm GMT regardless of what time your broker's daily candle closes

5 pm est is the close of NY session and is regarded as close of fx trading day

Hello mikelath,

I think this system is worth trying.

It came out almost breakeven yesterday, when I first started testing it.

Now I'm not sure whether I have placed my trades well, although previous days high and low + or - 5, sl 30, tp 15, 30, 50 is no rocketscience.

Could you please give me an example of EUR/USD trades for today, as which are the two prices you've placed the high and low orders?

Thanks a lot

just found this thread.. i am a big fan of mechanical systems and although this is a very simplistic method it has enough merit to warrent further exploration!

i think the long term expectancy of such a system can be greatly increased through the following:

1.

trades are taken only on "inside days"

or

since inside days are few and far between perhaps increasing risk or doubling trade size on such days

2.

apply some sort of martingale or similar compounding technique to losing days

ie - after one losing day increase bet on 2nd day

or

following a winning day decrease position size for next day

obviously in order to effeciently fine tune the money management aspect one would need and expert written as manual backtesting would take hours if not days, maybe if there are no other takers i will donate one when time allows

--- 帖子 #78 ---
What do you mean my "inside days"?

thanks

--- 帖子 #79 ---
an inside day is one in which neither the high or low of the previous day was exceeded (for exampe if the highs and lows of today were inside the range of the previous day)

as opposed to an "outside day" in which both the high and low of the previous day is exceeded

GL

Is it + and - 5 pips with spread or with without?

Thanks once again. I have  a specific problem. i need an example to clarify the procedure. Using the long and short order placing formulas what exact figures did you input for stoploss ,takeprofit, and entry for say 30 august . PLEASE I know my request sounds dumb but the order panel keeps rejecting my orders submted saying incorrect stoploss and takeprofit. Also the market is not fair as i have lost some money in recent past. You may use my email : aodvissionsinter@yahoo.com. Thanks in advance.

I think you should learn how to use your order entry system first, you can easily lose money if you dont understand what all those entry mean ! ..

[quote=inspiredcapi;1570308]PLEASE I know my request sounds dumb but the order panel keeps rejecting my orders submted saying incorrect stoploss and takeprofit. quote]

you enter in pending orders using buy stops and sell stops.  If your attemting to enter in orders that are buy limits and sell limits they won't go through.  Get that part right and the rest should be pretty easy.  I hope that helps....

Happy weekend to all!

Note:I closed all my positions today at 20:30 London time, as I trade at Oanda and the spreads during the weekend are very big (10 pips).

--- 帖子 #90 ---
You should also note that there are some market makers who reject limit orders which are too close to the price. At least that is what I have heard.

Comment: A very interesting day. GBPUSD and GBPJPY were triggered and stopped out soon after placing the orders. Both the long and short orders were triggered on numerous pairs...some for the better, some not so. Closed out 2 lots on EURGBP at breakeven to make way for new orders. Overall, another good result.

Comment: As we can see it was a pretty uneventful day. The long trade on GBPUSD was the only one that triggered. All others traded within the range of the previous days high and low. It happens. We can't expect a breakout every single day. Patience and sticking with the system is the key.

This is the first day so far that all pairs were profitable.

Hi pipsters.

For the sake of evaluation, the following are the results for each individual currency pair for the week and month of August (this thread was started only at the beginning of this week) :

GBPUSD  -145

GBPJPY  +175

USDJPY  +170

EURJPY  +315

EURGBP  +50

EURUSD  +20

Total:  +585pips

Comment: So far we can see that EURJPY is the best performer, though one week is too short a timeframe to conclude that, based on forward testing, this pair will be the best choice if we aspire to trade only one pair.

I am starting to consider that for the sake of diversification and spreading the risk, trading all or most of the above pairs will be the better option.

Let us allow the results to guide that decision.

Hi,

I wrote a simple EA for this strategy.

According to my few backtests, so far the most profitable pair would be GBPUSD.

Very interesting and simple to understand system. Can anyone coach me as to which brokerage firms will allow me to get some practice charts and dealing software to try this out for longer than a week? Maybe a month or two or three.....?

try Oanda.......unlimited demo account

Why are you using 18hrs instead of 24hrs? Are you using the 24hrs High/Low for your calculations or the 18hrs High/Low?

Thanks.

Feel free to use to it for forward testing, just set EA on a demo account, allow it to trade and wait for the results

EUR/JPY +95 pips

I got stopped. I put my 3 buy orders at 159.01 (high+5pips) and they got stopped at 158.71. The price went further down until 158.51

How did you made 95 pips?

I got the high (158.96) and low (156.77) prices using Netdania charts, as the candle there opens exactly at 17 Eastern time (22 London time).

I took the high and low prices for the 30th of August.

Have I done something wrong???

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi

Pr1mer

Can you modify that EA to work on hourly high and low! . that would be fun and  most profitable. B'cas u are working on trend and trend is friend!......

I have modified the code and profitable for last 10 days! awsome right!

I m posting results too..

Hi,

A Newbie Question about the EA

Could some one please help me understand the entry fields in both the EA and the EA Strategy Tester. Some of it is easy to understand the others are not so easy. (see PDF for pics)

Maybe there is a website I can go to to learn about EA setting

Please feel free to post here or PM me if it clear the thread for other related stuff.

Many thanks,

Billser

Hi Pr1mer,

could you explain how it works?

your file goes to the indicator or experts?

how do i chose the currency? time, etc...

thanks

--- 帖子 #104 ---
This system sounds very interesting... Since I work about 10 - 12 hours a day... I had paper tested it for the last 4 days on the USD/JPY and made

205 pips for the week...I am going to continue to test somemore before trading live.. I like this system sincce you don't have to sit in front of the screen all day...

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi,

isn't this in effect identical to the systems proposed by Tkimble? (check under threads started by that user after checking his username"). >>> http://forexfactory.com/member.php?u=25926

I'd like to point out that by using 90 pips stop and 95 pips TP you are effectively getting around 1:1 risk/reward, i.e. need a chance of MORE than 50% to end up profitable in a simplified "all or nothing scenario".

How it boils down with the partials I don't know, but assuming that no stops are moved at any point, chance shouldn't change much...not that I know the advanced stochastic/statistic part of all this. All I see is 3x30=90 at risk, 15+30+50=95 possible to gain.

This may or not work in the long run, but it requires insane patience, dedication and faith that it will work in the first place, as witnessed by the dying out of the tkimble threads once the strong trending periods which are needed for profitability also died down again..

Just wanted to point out to be careful with anything that has only 1:1 risk/reward and to be SURE that it's something that arguably works due to certain reasons.

And to mention tkimble's stuff, since those threads might hold some interesting stuff as well.(for additional ideas or similiar e.g.)

No offense

Take care,

SeekingLight

Hi I use FXCM for my trading and metatrader for my charts, both have demo accounts to start you off, once live you can run FXCM through MT4 (metatrader)

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Hans.

Let us be clear as to what the 18hrs expiry is referring to here.

When you place the pending/limit orders, depending on your broker, there is usually an option to select a time expiry for those limit orders. I have chosen to use 18hrs to try to avoid having a trade triggered just before I'm due to place new orders for the next day.

To simplify your calculations for the high and low, open a 1 hour chart at 5pm ESTand take the high and low of that day (again, depending on your broker, the new daily candle may not have been opened ).

I hope this helps.

mike

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi Slkosier.

I'm glad that this system is suitable for your lifestyle.

mike

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi SeekingLight.

Yes, the BASIS of this strategy is very similar to some of tkimble's (which I am quite familiar with) though definitely NOT identical.

In fact, I have tried his weeklyscalping system and am currently paper trading his SAR system. He also has a dailyscalping strategy which he uses in conjunction with the weekly. Both rely on the probability of breakouts using the previous day or weeks' close, though with a few more variables to consider.

I haven't continued with the weekly system as the trades are often stopped out before the weekly trend is established...so re-entry can occur  multiple times (thus increased  drawdown) before the trades are profitable for the week. Personally I was not comfortable with this experience. However, overall, coupled with good money management, this strategy seems quite sound.

In a very simplified sense the risk:reward for Daily95pips is approx. 1:1. We also need to consider the 4+ possible scenarios as described in post#1.

One very important key to successful trading is indeed PATIENCE. It is the 'need for speed' that all too often has many a trader crushed in their early days of learning how to be a successful trader. As long as the strategy and money management systems are sound, the rest is simply implementation which actually just becomes a seemingly boring routine, especially with a system as simple as Daily95pips.

Also bear in mind that the very purpose of this thread is to simultaneously share and test this strategy to ascertain it's feasability.

cheers

Hi qwer1234.

I'm not really at liberty to disect past trades, however I actually wrote down entry for the above mentioned EURJPY long at 158.51. I had a quick look at a 1hr chart for that day to confirm. So, if I made a mistake it proved to be in my favour:. In any case, let's move on to more profitable trades.

How would you get the high and lows for the tuesday trading if there is a US holiday on monday?

and do you want to place trade orders on monday since there is a holiday? if so I are these high and lows right?

HIGH --- 115.78

LOW  --- 115.71

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Just because the US and Canada are on holiday does'nt mean the rest of the world is too......the market will just be a little thinner is all, you will still have a monday candle............

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thank you..I just wanted make sure...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Quer1234,

I think you and Mike may not be trading on exactly the same time frame. Each broker delivers charts whose day begins at a unique world time, i.e., GMT +1, GMT -2, etc., so unless you are using the exact same start and end times as Mike, you may experience some discrepancies, especially

with a pair like EU/JY, which can easily move 50-70 pips or more in any given hour.

That said, going back over the charts for 8/31, I am unable to figure out how he made that particular entry, and would love to know what parameters he used to enter where he did, as that might teach us all something of value.

Take care...

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Do you get your monday High and Lows from sunday or do you get them from fridays?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi lads.

In an attempt to clarify the above, I can only share with you how I have the timeframe set up for my own trading:

1.) I have the clock on my computer set at EST.

2.) My broker is Oanda, and the time on my trading platform is the same as my computer.

3.) At 5pm EST I open the daily chart and take the high and low of the current daily candle (I may have to remove from post#1 the part about waiting for the new daily candle to open, though again it depends on your broker and timeframe ). The exception will be on Monday when I take the high and low from the previous Friday, unless there has been significant activity over the weekend in which case I may take Sundays data.

The main point to consider is that based on different timeframes there will be different results. Somedays others will get a better result than I and visa versa. This happened in the first day ( checkout the first few posts) where some of the guys on this thread got +95pips on one of the pairs

(I can't recall which one) when I got only +15pips.

We can still see that overall my results have been good.

Once settling on your own approach to this strategy, the idea is to just stick to it and if the results are good you know you're onto a winner.

I hope this helps you all.

mike

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi Mike,

Thanks for clarifying.

I also felt that it really made no difference when you ended your day, as long as you were consistent about it (though I have not tested this theory as yet).

But just to clarify further:

Your high for 8/30 only included the time from 0000 - 1700 EST. You did not go back a full 24 hours (to 8/29 at 1700), and therefore the  earlier higher highs that occurred around 24 hours earlier did not play into the picture, so your [high+5 pip] target entry came sooner at a LOWER price than if you had included those earlier highs of the day. That, my friend, is why you made +95 while another trader lost -90. Problem solved!

Please correct me if I'm wrong here.

Thanks so much!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi all. It's me again.

I have amended post#1 with more clear instructions on entry that should have us all using roughly the same data and timeframe. I use the word roughly because price may still vary between brokers even when we use the same timeframe.

Oh, and thanks  to Jeff Singer (K2KV) for the above help.

The EURUSD short trade reached the 2nd PT and I manually closed out the remainder.

Hi Mike,

Just a quick question...

I'm wondering why you expire your orders in 18 hrs instead of a full 24. Assuming you place your orders at 5PM EST, you kill them at 11AM the next morning if they fail to fulfill.

Can you explain your reasoning behind this?

Thanks very much for providing such a terrific method, and for sharing your time.

Hi all.

So far so good.

After amending post#1 in an attempt to clarify entry, today I've decided to include here the entry levels for todays trades. L: stands for long and S: stands for short.

USDJPY         L: 116.46                   S: 115.28

EURJPY         L: 158.47                    S: 156.51

EURGBP         L: 0.6773                    S: 0.6733

Hi TheThing.

I'm demo trading this strategy with the purpose of shortlisting the pairs I am currently using on this thread to 3-4. I'll then continue demo trading these remaining pairs until it is clear that they are consistently profitable. I'll then go live, using a money management system whereby 3% of trading capital will be risked on each pair's trade for the day, so that if there are 4 pairs remaining, a maximum of 12% of my trading account will be at risk each day if we diligently cancel the short orders if the long orders are triggered and visa versa. If there are only 3 pairs it will be 9%. The purpose of using this strategy on multiple pairs is for diversification and spreading of risk. Therefore, risking up to 12% each day may turn out to be quite comfortable.

mike

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi Jeff.

It's nice to see that you're still around.

To answer your question, I choose 18hrs expiry to reduce the chance of orders being triggered just before I'm due to place the new orders for the following day....just my view on things....it may or may not work in my favour. So, it's your call whether you want to use 18 or 24 hrs expiry.

mike

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Thanks Mike for your reply!

Will be watching this thread with interest, trade it live with micro lots and will share my results.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi Mike,

Yep, I'm still here, and quite enthusiastic, too; I like what you've done here. Thanks for your reply -- makes good sense.

Tonight I'm trading $1 dollar lots (I really should have warned everyone, since my trades too often signal price moves in the opposite direction!), anxious to see results in the morning. I'm already down 75 pips on US/JY (as you must be, too, since our entries are in sync).

Earlier I was watching my monitors, and thought about getting out when I was up 45 or so since I saw the price beginning to fall, but decided to just let things run their course, and let the chips fall where they may. But, I really do hate to see a good trade go bad, so I might just end some trades early in the future, if I happen to be at the monitor. I'm accustomed to babysitting my trades during the day, so it's hard for me to just sit on my hands without taking any action to protect my profits, especially if I am right there.

Wonder what your thoughts (or anyone else's thoughts) are on that...

Btw, do you have an easy way to figure out your results in pips at the end of the day? Oanda Activities screen only shows me gains/losses in dollars, not pips, unless I'm missing something.

Thanks again...

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I'm glad to be of assistance Jeff.

I must say that you are a brave man for going live on this strategy(if that's what you meant by "trading $1 lots" ) this early in the piece.

I was actually a bit late to place the demo orders today, and came back later to find that some would've already triggered. What I see so far is that the GBPJPY long has ended with +15pips. As I am currently paper trading this strategy, I can look back over the charts and see the likely results (unless price came perilously close to TP or SL in which case I usually give the conservative outcome the benefit of the doubt).

I try not to get too emotionally caught up in the trades and as a result make decisions before the trades have run their course. That's the very reason I am inclined towards set and forget strategies such as this. Try to bear in mind that there is always the chance of a trade coming back and reaching full profit....and if it doesn't and goes the other way, so be it. That indicates to me that the system may need a little more tweaking to maximise performance without me interferring with the trades themselves. For example, so far we've seen that EURGBP is potentially not as suited to this strategy as other pairs. So, we may just need to remove it from the list.

That being said, I'll admit that I still can't resist checking on the trades throughout the day. And in those times when I see the price is just near the take profit level and I feel the urge to close out and protect profits, I force myself to walk away and come back later because I can feel my emotions being overly drawn into the trading process, and that's what I want to avoid.

I just know from experience that the more room there is to make desicions after trades have been placed, the more chance there is of being taken on an emotional rollercoaster. I'm trying to streamline my trading so that this doesn't occur.

As I've heard it said: "trading is 20% skills and 80% psychology", so it's the psychology part that we are addressing here.

Regarding ascertaining your results with Oanda; if you have physically placed either demo or live trades with the 3 profit targets as per this system, whenever a profit target is hit a green dot will appear on your chart. If you are stopped out, a red dot will appear. So, depending on how many green dots appear, you can easily calculate the result in pips:

3 green dots = +95pips

2 green dots & 1 red dot = +15pips

1 green dot  &  1 red dot  =  -45pips

1 red dot = -90pips

Alternatively, simply check the movement of price from your entry levels eg. if long entry on GBPUSD is 2.0196 and price goes past 2.0246 you will know that you've achieved all 3 profit targets for a total of +95pips.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Mike,

Good thinking on reconciling results on Oanda!

Yes, I suppose I'm pretty brave (just couldn't resist).

I think your approach -- letting it ride until the end -- is healthy, and it's a good test of The System. I sure like the idea of having time to take care of other things during the day, while I earn big pips. But, you're still on a demo so that removes much of the trauma of sitting by while your funds dwindle. I'm not so sure I can simply close my eyes when I know I can impart some control over the state of my booty.

That said, I will go with the flow for a couple of days, and see how it all plays out. Tonight I played with just three pairs: EU/US, US/JY, and EU/JY. So far, I'm down -135 pips. Glad I'm only brave enough to play for $1/pip!! I figured the most I could lose is $540 on the three pairs, and what are the odds of that happening?

Shhhh -- don't answer...

Thanks!

I have added a 4th unit (lot or whatever) that runs till the end of the day. Sometimes this can scoop 200 pips just alone. This might give some extra boost to the results. I am demo testing this strategy. Or variation of this.

hi

i am not too sure if you really want to go real on this one in this week. cos this friday US is reporting Non-farm payroll. usually during this time.. the market is very volatile.. suddenly up and down usually happen quite offen. you might want to consider to try real next week.

regards

--- 帖子 #137 ---
By the way the answer to your question SynWind is that you need various types of positions that are answer for various types of markets. ie different sls tps, no tp etc... Do a bit of research

--- 帖子 #138 ---
hey mike i have a similar method to this i cannot guarantee 95 pips on a daily basis but yes 50 pips are almost certain and this is an example from the eur/jpy pair guys have a look.

Hi Bksujal, Could you please explain the 09/03 day how did you get the short@158.74??? Do you wait for the top/bottom and you trail your entry point?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
firstly mate the date your asking is 08/31

now the range on 08/30 was 219 pips the high was 158.96 and the low was 156.77 so the 10% of the range is 21.9 round it to 22 pips so your entry points for the next day will be previous day's high minus 22 pips for going short and for going long your entry point for the next day will be previous day's low plus 22 pips.

To go short 158.96-22 pips = 158.74

To go long 156.77+22 pips = 156.99

Finally remember your day is supposed to start at 17:00 Et and end at 17:00 Et.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
What SL and TP are you using. And are you using multiple entries with different TP's or just 1 entry. Thanks and God Bless

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Very nice  You gave me some new ideas  Thanx I've been thinking about such a thing earlier. High and lows are natural S/R so if they are not broken then your method could come into play.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
The only problem when you have strong trending weeks... when the trend is constantly going...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
i use 1:2 RR Ratio and it depends on the pair your trading and please before trading have a look at the Atr that is what i look at and set my tp.

Cheers!!!

Bksujal

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thanks for replying back. All i have to figure out now is how to use and interpet the ATR indicator.   Thanks and God Bless.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Till now i must tell you i have had a 100% in the last 2 weeks. I learnt in my course and made my own interpretation of it and this is what i produced.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Have A Look At This Chart For Usd/jpy The Range For Yesterday Was 108 Pips So The 10% Is 10.8 Round To 11 Pips.

To Go Short The Entry Point Is 116.42-11 Pips = 116.31

And You Must Go Short Remember It Is Important To Note Where The Price Closes At The End Of The Day If It Ends Somewhere Near The Highs Then Your Idea Should Just Be To Go Short And Not Long. Please Keep That In Mind.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
How do you use the ATR with your method and what setings.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi Syn,

Thanks for your concern, but I am aware of the NFP report and have no intention of trading Friday. If it gets too crazy for me, I usually stay out.

Take care...

Hi Bksujal,

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but it appears that your strategy is the opposite of Mikelath's "Daily 95 Pips" system.

He goes long on the previous day's high, plus 5 pips. However, you go short on the previous day's high, less 10% of the day's range.

He goes short on the previous day's low, less 5 pips. However, you go long on the previous day's low, plus 10% of thd day's range.

In summary, it seems that your strategy is a retracement strategy, while Mikelath's strategy is a trending strategy. Perhaps there's a way to blend the best of the two strategies. Any suggestions...

What are your SL & TP for a given currency pair (I believe you mentioned that your r/r is 1:2)?

Also, wouldn't it be better to not factor in the 10% of ATR?  It seems that by including thiis item you increase the risk...

Thanks,

Walt

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Bullrock,

You mentioned on post #142 that Bksujal's system gave you "some new ideas" along the lines of what you've been considering, as the daily Highs & Lows are inherently S&R points.  How would you merge the strategy in the above quote with Bksujal's strategy?

Thanks,

Walt

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Bksujal,

Looks like a very intriguing system, and I'm sure many folks might be interested in learning more about it, including me. However, the two strategies appear to be quite different, and hardly related.

With all due respect, and for the sake of courtesy to the originator of this thread, it might be more appropriate (and advantageous) for you to start your own thread where you can enjoy much greater discussion and focus more closely on your own specific methods, without diluting our focus here on the Daily95pips strategy.

Hope I'm correct here, I mean no offense whatsoever...

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I have been lurking on this and many other strategies and I must say that this thing is sweet. I will start micro-trading this today. I for one can not seriously trade demo. I just can't do it. Even if its pennies I am focused. As far as blending to opposite strategies I personally wouldn't. I would instead use it on some of the other pairs that do a lot of head-fakes. The Aud/usd is a perfect example. Of course I will later test what I have proposed with the other system. Just wanted to stop in and say thanks to Mikelath for bringing a great strategy to the table even if he isn't the author. A lot of the other posts are filled with mediocre systems that have at best a 40% success rate.  Thanks Mike.

Cuda

--- 帖子 #154 ---
mate I recommend try it out on a demo please and dont get so excited everyone that all lose in this strategy. I recommend this works best for eur pairs ,and yes I agree this strategy is not so similar to mike's but yes it does have something similar with it that is the high's and low's

Regards,

Bksujal

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi Bksujal,

What are your SL & TP?  How do you protect against a trending pattern?  Would you consider not including the 10% ATR adjustment for opening your positions?

Thanks,

Walt

--- 帖子 #156 ---
FIRSTLY MATE I DO USE 1:2 RATIO FOR MOST OF MY TRADES AND WELL I AM NOT A LONG TERM TRADER SO THE TREND IS IMPORTANT BUT IN THIS CASE IT HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH THE MOVES ON A DAILY BASIS FOR ME. I JUST USE ATR TO CHECK THE VOLATILITY OF THE PAIR WHICH I AM TRADING IN, FOR INSTANCE, FOR EUR/USD MY TP WOULD JUST BE 50 PIPS WHEREAS FOR EUR/JPY IT WOULD BE A 100 PIPS PLUS!!!

REGARDS,

BKSUJAL

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I've had some thoughts about this strategy in the past day and unless I'm wrong (Likely!) this appears to be a hedging system with money management.

The first thing I thought with a system like this was to reduce it to the simplest component. What would happen if you placed two trades. Long SL at say 30, TP at 60 and likewise for short. Then no matter what the market does you profit unless the market does nothing in which case you loose nothing. 30 pips a day but what is the risk?

I'm sure there is a flaw here, but I'm not sure what it is?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Ok guys then I'm signing off for today good luck to everyone for their trades.

Cheers and HAPPY TRADING.

Regards,

Bksujal

--- 帖子 #159 ---
My idea is to do this. We got the high and low of the previous day.

So as per the rules of Daily95pips I go long high+5 pips and go short high -10% of the previous days high-low. The SL of the long is the short leg. We could do on another account or if hedging available on the same account the reverse. Or if the previous bar is bullish just do the long/short leg. if the previous bar is bearish than do the short/long leg. But this is a completely different strategy and would require another thread.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Sounds good bullrock. Please share your results on this thread.

Well, that was fun!

Last night I traded eu/us, eu/jy, eus/jy, for real money, @ $1/pip. I ended up losing around -60 pips, but I learned quite a bit. What I learned was that the 30 pip SL was too deep for my style, and that a 50 pip TP is a bit too ambitious. Again, for my style. That's not to say it won't work for others, but while watching my trades unfold today, I saw some clear profits turn back because I sensed my TP points were too high.

So, tonight, I've decided to tweak things a bit, to make my expectations a bit more modest and - hopefully - keep my losses lower. Here's my plan:

Same entry, same time frame, H+5, L-5.

SL = 15

TP: 10, 15, 20

It's possible I'll get stopped out everywhere, but I've cut my potential losses in half, so we'll have to see how it all plays out.

I might miss a big move with a 50 pip gain, but normally I am at the computer, so I would be able to move my TP in that case (unfortunately, I will be out most of the day tomorrow, so I'll have no idea what's happening until I return).

It's just an experiment, a tweak of what looks like a terrific system from Mikelath. I may go back to the original, but will report on my results later tomorrow. Mike said earlier that this was not just an offering of a system, but an attempt to tweak it. So, I'll do my part, with 1$ lots. Another poster said it: I just find it impossible to demo-trade seriously, and am much more involved when I have some real money at stake.

I definitely think entry is key here. If we have it right, good money management will let us win.

Another thing I learned is that, having been scalping mostly, I really like to see all those double-digit pips on the board. It's definitely more fun to play with bigger numbers.

Any comments or suggestions?

The first day's results are posted here. It was a very mediocre day due to low volatility in the market, highly attributed to the Bank Holiday in the UK.

Date: Monday 27 August 2007

GBPUSD        GBPJPY        USDJPY        EURJPY        EURGBP        EURUSD

+15pips       +15pips        -45pips        +15pips        no touch      no touch

Happy pipping !

Ok. I'll try to get more organised with the results. As i can edit this post (unlike post#2), I hope to add all future results here. I'll also add daily comments, serving the purpose of a trading journal.

Date:               Tuesday 28 August 2007

GBPUSD          + 95

GBPJPY  +95

USDJPY  +95

EURJPY  +15

EURGBP  +23

EURUSD   -90

Total: +233pips

Comment: A good day overall. EURJPY came within 2pips of the 50 profit target. EURGBP 15pips PT was reached and the other 2 lots were closed out manually before new orders were placed for the next day.

Date: Wednesday 29 August 2007

GBPUSD -180

GBPJPY  -30

USDJPY +105

EURJPY +190

EURGBP +15

EURUSD +95

Total:  +195pips

Comment: A very interesting day. GBPUSD and GBPJPY were triggered and stopped out soon after placing the orders. Both the long and short orders were triggered on numerous pairs...some for the better, some not so. Closed out 2 lots on EURGBP at breakeven to make way for new orders. Overall, another good result.

Date: Thursday 30 August

GBPUSD  -90

GBPJPY  no touch

USDJPY  no touch

EURJPY  no touch

EURGBP  no touch

EURUSD  no touch

Total: -90pips

Comment: As we can see it was a pretty uneventful day. The long trade on GBPUSD was the only one that triggered. All others traded within the range of the previous days high and low. It happens. We can't expect a breakout every single day. Patience and sticking with the system is the key.

Date: Friday 31 August

GBPUSD +15

GBPJPY  +95

USDJPY  +15

EURJPY  +95

EURGBP  +12

EURUSD +15

Total: +247pips

Comment: USDJPY long trade came within 3pips of 50TP before retracing. EURJPY long came within 3pips of stop before proceeding to 100pips above entry, achieving all 3 profit targets. Again manually closed out EURGBP short for a nominal +4pips on each order.

This is the first day so far that all pairs were profitable.

Total for this week and month of August:  +585pips

Happy pipping everybody !

Date: Monday 3 September

GBPUSD  no touch

GBPJPY   no touch

USDJPY  no touch

EURJPY  no touch

EURGBP  -10

EURUSD  -20

Total:  -30pips

Comment: Another slow Monday, this time attributed to US Labour Holiday. So there was very little activity. The only pairs that triggered were EURGBP and EURUSD,and it happened late in the session. Thus these trades were manually closed before the new orders were placed.

Date: Tuesday 4 September

GBPUSD +95

GBPJPY +95

USDJPY breakeven

EURJPY +95

EURGBP -90

EURUSD +40

Total: +235pips

Comment: It's nice to see the pairs breaking out again and getting back into the swing of things !  The USDJPY short trade reached the 1st PT before retracing to stop out the remaining 2 lots. It then proceeded to trigger the long orders, reaching the 1st PT and I then manually closed out the remainder to make way for the new days orders, thus resulting in a breakeven scenario. The EURUSD short trade reached the 2nd PT and I manually closed out the remainder.

Date: Wednesday 5 September 2007

GBPUSD -25

GBPJPY -75

USDJPY -69

EURJPY -45

EURGBP no touch

EURUSD +63

Total:  -151pips

Comment: Days like these are a good reminder of the downside potential. Both long and short orders were triggered on GBPUSD, GBPJPY and USDJPY, with only partial profits achieved before retracing and stopping out. I can only conclude that using multiple profit targets help to hedge the positions.

Hi k2kv,

I think that's a good idea. I've experienced simmilar drawbacks with no profit as a result

I'm curious about your summaries.

Greets

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Mike,

Looks like you're averaging around +90 pips per day -- Not too shabby!

I'm impressed...

--- 帖子 #165 ---
That's why I'm using a Trailing Stop on the 50 pips TP lot with 25 pips trailing, so far I'm having more stops on the 30 pips and not on the 50 pips TP because like you say the 50 pips it's kind of ambitious for my style too, if it hit the 50 pips great but if it doesn't then I get at least 1-5 pips and not -30. This is a matter of personal choice of course. I'm thinking on adding a trailing stop on the 30 pips TP lot but have not decided yet.

mike thanks for the strategy.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
The results for 5 Aug 2007 was not good...check yourself...

--- 帖子 #167 ---
The underlying logic of the method indicates:

"Better not trade during range market, like right now xxx/jpy has been ranging for a few days."

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Guillo,

Yes, a trailing stop would be great, and would solve many problems. Alas, Oanda doesn't offer this on their platform. But, I enjoy their tight spreads and seamless execution, so I'll have to compromise. That's one reason I like to stick by my trades when they're on -- so I can act as my own "watchful" stop when I'm needed.

Yep, trying to make +50 seems like a stretch to me, especially when the penalty for not making it is most likely -30. Would I bet 30 pips that I will make 50 on what seems like a breakout move? Not usually.

Tonight, thus far, US/JY went short 10. My first TP kicked in and I was up +10. The remaining two trades began to slide back and I normally would have closed them with a profit of +8 each, but I had to leave for a little while (as this system calls for). When I returned, they had both stopped out at -15 each. Such is life. Price eventually retraced -30, so changing my SL tonight from 30 to 15 definitely helped to keep my losses lower, at least in this instance.

I'm experimenting this week, and want to see what will happen if I just leave things to complete on their own. So, it's all good.

Next week, I'll apply what I've learned and most likely will take a different approach (and attempt to recoup my little losses)...

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Better to trade in the demo account first..never trade in live account before you sure about the profit...

Sometime there are people have an idea about trading forex, so they post here to test the system together...

Believe me.. if someone have a system that can profit in live account...he/she will never post here the system....

If you have a key to rich...will you give the key to other?

Even someone want to buy your system that profitable..maybe you will not sell it...

So if someone say that he want to sell his profitable system..don't believe it...

If someone want to sell book that make us profitable.. don't believe it...

Because if he/she has the profitable system..why he/she want to get money from selling book? why don't he/she just trading and make big money from trading with his/her system?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hmmm...good idea guillo.

I don't have a trailing stop option with Oanda, however if I'm around to monitor the trades I could move the stop on the 50TP order up to breakeven or maybe 10pips in profit after the first 2 profit targets have been reached.

Much appreciate the input.

Hi bksujal.

A very interesting approach. From some of the comments on the thread I'm getting a message that we are in a ranging market. So this strategy seems to be most suited when the market is in this condition.

I'm glad that you've brought the idea to this thread. If possible, I'd love to compare the results of the two strategies. If you are able to post forward tested results of this approach on this thread that would be great.

Alternatively, if you decide to start a new thread based on this strategy alone please let us all know.

Hey, at the end of the day, if this strategy performs better than Daily95pips, then I'm there to adopt it without hesitation !

mike

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Mate i can't guarantee it that my strategy would fetch a 95 pips daily, but yes it could get you 50 pips or even more. My results for today were:

Usd/Jpy = 25 pips

Eur/Jpy = 60 pips

Net = 85 pips

And i am happy to continue in this thread, not interested in starting a new one.

Hi,

May I know if your price is based on hourly chart or daily chart?

Please advise

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Ok guys have a look at this chart for eur/jpy which i used today I must tell this is one of my most favourite pairs.

Okay firstly previous day's range was 196 pips so the 10% of that = 19.6 round to 20 pips. We would be looking to go long because the day ended close to the low's so more chances of a long trade than a shorter one. So our entry price would be previous day's low 156.69+20 pips = 156.89 is our entry price.

Today's high was 157.82 and the rest is history. Cheers!!! and HAPPY TRADING.

Bksujal

Hi Folks,

I have been running this system for a few days on a demo account and the results have been as follows:

31 aug

E/U +15

G/U +15

U/J -45

E/J -90

G/J -90

TOTAL -195

3 SEPT

E/U -36

G/U -90

U/J -30

E/J +95

G/J +95

TOTAL +145

5 SEPT

E/U +45

G/U -75

U/J +15

E/J -45

G/J -90

TOTAL -150

GRAND TOTAL SO FAR = -236 pips

I have also backtested the method using the U/J pair for the months of June and July, the results are as follows (I had to do it by hand so I just picked a pair and months to test at random):

JUNE 2007 = +130 pips (U/J pair only)

JULY 2007 = -200 pips (U/J pair only)

Cheers,

Axel.

What setting do you have your ATR .

Thank you

Billser

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Mike, thanks for the  system.  your logic is great,

To step the system, only loyally sticking to it is not enough, we need to realise why we use this system.  and I try to express this:

the loss is fundamentally due to "indecisive market", therefore
when market ranges, please don't enter!  since this system catch trends.

That's it, and everyday spend 20 minutes to study if the market demonstrate a trend or not is a easy thing for most ppl.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
how come you got so many losses while mikelath has so many wining???

what the different in trading??

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Here is an example from 31 Aug as to the reason for some of the differences. In this example a profit of 95 was reported for this trade, while I got a loss of 90 pips. Other times it is just a matter of bad fills vs good fills. I am not trying to be negative here, just look into it for yourself if you are sufficiently interested...

--- 帖子 #182 ---
To make work this method you need to do two things

1. use a 4th yunit that has chance to complete the day with a large amount of pips if that is the case. This way you can leave profit to run.

2. move your SL to BE using whatever rules you belive is valid. For example when the second TP has been hit.. This way you will not turn winners to loosers.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thanks for Mike's contribution!

However, I 90% think that this method won't work.

My reasons:

1.  Days for ranging market is more than days for trending market.

(I have no statistics proof, you feel yourself).

2.  Last week in August, anyway we can make money, since there are drastic moves.

3.  90 SL vs 95 TP, 1:1 risk/return ratio.  So I changed to 80 SL vs 120 TP, still no luck.  And this is not the fundamental reason.

The fundamental reason is the 1st reason,  you cannot use this method in days like this week.

Sorry, my snapshot is in Chinese, but basically show you a MT4 backtest results, only GJ is shown here, I tried UJ, EurUsd.  All failed.

starting fund 10000, profit: -8701; testing days: 2374.

the curve shows how the 10000 initial fund drains away -- pretty stable pattern.

Well, we all know MT4's tester is not that reliable, I tried to download more data and set all parameters to my best knowledge.  Even MT4 not that reliable, I still see this method as a no go.

To this point, I recommend using this method necessarily WITH additional TA to identify market momentum.  Without momentum (that is not always available), this method is bad.  I'm simply communicating my own opinion, no hard feelings.  Mike, you still did a good job, we are keeping thinking and learning all together here.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Did you care to read my previous post yes? no? I have made detailed calculations. To your disappointment it does work and evrages 28 pips a day on GU with 4 units using the enhancements I have mentioned.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Oh and, from my professional experience, the EA doesn't work of the Metatrader. I have made several strategies they were all loosers using the Metatrader however when I cared to write C++ code and backtest my own code and/or backtest manually they suddenly became winners...   . But the Metatrader is a black box to me and I know exactly what I have done. So I trust my own code.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Would you mind posting a chart for clarification?  I apologize, I just tend to be more visual.   Thanks!

Chris

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi Bksujal,

I think your entry method is valid, and you seem to be doing very well. But I think most of us are in the dark regarding how you place your TP and SL targets.

For example, do you place only one TP, or several levels, as Mike does? Better yet, can you tell us where your TP & SL targets were placed in the above referenced trades?

It would be most helpful if you would kindly tell us specifically where you place your TP target (s) and SL for each of the pairs you trade.

In other words, we'd like to see the specific set of rules you use, that are responsible for success with your method. Also, this will help us visualize how your trades develop, and will be a good point from which we can experiment further.

Thanks for sharing this with us...

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Oh, yeah, great insights!

Just want newbies like me who also follow this thread to understand that we should add more safe belts into this system before we go to live account.

by the way, I didn't test GU tho.  But it's exciting to know that you did it.  Bring it on.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Just to recap, I made a few changes to the basic 95pip rules, as follows:

Changed SL to 15 (was 30)

Changed TP to 10, 15, 20 (was 15, 30, 50).

Results:

Eur/$   -45 instead of -90

Eur/JY  No hits

US/JY  -20 instead of -50

Net for the day -65 instead of -140

Note that due to my inexact entry time, my EU/JY buy orders canceled just five minutes before I would have seen +45 on this pair.

So, results not so good for me today.

Based on my last two days trading with real $1 lots, I most likely will not trade with any unattended method overnight into tomorrow, especially since the NFP report is due in the morning. When I start up again (probably Monday), I will most likely experiment with Bksujal's system, and see where that takes me.

Happy trading to all!

I've started to adopt moving the stop on the 50TP trade to breakeven after the first 2 profit targets have been reached. Thus the better result for GBPUSD. Currently -156pips overall for the week.

I'd just like to thank everyone for their contribution to this thread. The great thing about forexfactory is that there are so many experienced traders to help newbies like myself learn more about trading.

Some of the things I've learnt so far from this thread are:

1.) This strategy is suited to a trending market, NOT a ranging market. How we identify them before they occur is another story....hindsight is certainly a wonderful thing.

2.) Moving up the stop loss on the 50TP trade can help to maximise profits.

According to the profit targets on post#1, this can mean the difference between gaining +15pips and +45pips. This however, relies on being around to monitor the trades and adjust the stops accordingly, which takes away from the original 'set and forget' objective.

This thread is proving to be a great learning tool.

One of the problems with using a system like this over a wide range of different pairs, is the differences in volatility. I think that instead of using arbitrary figures for taking profit and for stops, perhaps you should consider using a percentage of ATR. For example for the take profit levels, you could use 10%, 20% and 30% of ATR for each pair, with a stop of say 20% ATR (I haven't tested any of these, they are just numbers off the top of my head). I also agree with Bullrock, that you need to have a position that gets held till the end of day, or perhaps 2X ATR or something so you can pick up those occasional big moves that happen only a few days each month, as those often news driven events will probably account for the majority of your monthly profit IMHO.

I have traded forex for some time now and most often I trade breakouts,so I will add my 2 cents. I like the basic thought of the point for the breakout,however I have yet to find a generic set it and forget it system.

1. Time of day is very important,I believe placing Oder's at 5PM is asking for trouble,especially if we do not close mid range on the daily candle. Any pair that deals with the jpy that is close to triggering,will often sweep the trigger and fail. The first 1 to 2 hours of the Asian session can be some of the most difficult forex action of the entire 24 hour period,imo. The closer orders can be entered to the open of the EUR...GBP session,greatly raises the probability that the breakout will have follow thru.

2. In my mind the whole basis of the trade is assuming you are going to get 50 pips,that is a very big assumption. Any time you fail to reach the 50 pip level and it comes back to stop you out the best you can have is a 15 pip winner. I have used a trailing stop on the last third of each of my entries. This change alone has greatly reduced my losses.

3. Failed breakouts are most often nasty!!! in many of the pairs it is not necessary to hang around for 30 pips if the level is broken and then quickly fails. When I look to enter a trade one of the most important aspects in my decision making is where can I find a key level to hide behind in terms of a stop. I may find a real nice entry point,but if the level I need to hide behind is too far away I will most often pass on the trade or use much smaller size.

4.In the same manner assuming you are long and i will use the Eur/Usd as my example tonight. Previous day high is 3710 where do I expect the next key resistance level that will slow this play down. The next key level is R1 at 3722. The same thinking applies as when looking for a stop point. Where is my first target,and in this case it is R1 and that is only 7 pips away if you place your entry 5 pips beyond the previous day high. Therefore, I can not enter this trade because I do not have 30 pips between key levels to get my partial. In this case I don't even have room for the 15 partial. In my mind the Eur/usd is not even a consideration on the long side in this session.

5.Lets now review the Eur/Usd short entry.Previous day low is 3635.You already have to break below S1 3647 to get to your trigger.This is very important for two reasons. First the eur/usd often uses s1 and r1 as stopping points,maybe even moreso than many of the other pairs. Your entry now becomes 3630( which is too great of a distance on this pair in my mind),and you now Identify you next key level which is s2 at 3603!! BIngo you now have the parameters you are looking for. Well almost and this is extremely important!!!! your target on this play should be your normal 15 pips on the first entry but your second target should be like 25 or 26 pips......not just your standard 30 pips. S2 3603 is a very key level but that does not mean it will always hit that number exact,you dont want to screw up a play trying to get to the exact pip,nor would you ever want your second partial a few pips beyond s2,it may never break thru that level. Ok now lets not forget about our stop price just incase yhis beautiful setup fails. Remember we had to break thru S1 3647 to get to the trigger . If we make a new low and then come back and test s1 and we can not hold that level to the downside,there is no longer a reason to stay with this trade. My stop would then be 3650, 3 pips above S1. In the event I get stopped out my exposure is only 20 pips,and I will bet that if s1 does not hold your 30 pip stop also gets taken out. Very long winded but a different way possibly to view the setups,no two setups are usually the same!

The more I analyze it, the more Bksujal's system of range trading makes sense.  The market ranges more than it trends, especially with cross currencies.  However, to protect against a trending market with a ranging system it may be feasible to take the current price as of 00:00 GMT and add 25% of the prior day's range to determine your short position.  Subtract 25% of the prior day's range to determine your long position.  Set TP at intervals of 10, 15, 20, & 25 pips from entry price.  I would set the SL at 50 pips from entry price.  The key is to not trade during major news events.  I would focus on traditional range bound pairs such as EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP, or perhaps even EUR/JPY.  I think this could yield 25 - 60 pips daily with minimal chance of a SL.

Thanks,

Walt

Nice point !

GJ always moves 2 pips when UJ moves 1 pip, it is obviously not appropirate to use a fixed number of SL/TP.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Here, another door is opened by you for us  , well of coz based on Bksujal's contributions.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Ok now guys have a look at this which is for today's eur/jpy in which i again made 50+ pips. Remember you are supposes to draw vertical lines on your chart from 17 Et to 17 Et. On this chart i have circled the high, low and the close of the day which is close to the high's. So today we would be looking to go short.

Yesterday's high's = 158.23

Yesterday's low's = 156.74

Range = 149 pips 10% = 14.9 pips round to 15

Today's Entry point = 158.23-15 pips = 158.08

Well some people are curious about my Tp and s/l. Well for the Tp i use the Atr to determine the range. Well and for stops i use a 1:2 risk/reward ratio. So today my stop was 40 pips to reward @ 80 pips.

Good luck in all your trades. Happy Trading.

Regards,

Rahul

A bit of this and that.

So I have made a bit of analysis in excel.

There can be problem with the accuracy because I have done the analysis on daily data. The analysis takes into consideration only the long side.
The strategy:

5 units -> 4 TP + 1 EOD

TP1 15% of the daily ATR(14)

TP1 30% of the daily ATR(14)

TP1 45% of the daily ATR(14)

TP1 60% of the daily ATR(14)

SL is 20% of the daily ATR(14)

The analysis:

Gu from 1999.09.14 - 2007.08.31 or 2073 days

Only long side. (I was lazy  )

Total:

TP1 = 15 890.7 pips

TP2 = 22 101.8 pips

TP3 = 22 381.7 pips

TP4 = 20 614.1 pips

EOD = 41 633 pips
Total = 122 621.2 pips without the losses

Losses without break even and without sl that is close at the end of the day: -298 918 pips
Result: -176 296 pips or -85 pips a day.

Clearly this way it is a looser strategy.

Losses with moving to be after TP2 is hit: -112 214 pips
Result: +10407.2 pips or 5 pips a day or 1 pip a day / unit

It is better but this is still something I wouldn't go for.

Now let us see the effect of 20% of SL of the ATR(14) and move to BE when TP2 is hit: -26 402.8 pips
Result: +96 209.4 pips or 46 pips a day or 9.2 pip a day / unit

Well this is not too bad.

Have fun.

Regards

bullrock

please my time here is GMT+1 and i need to know about the strategies. i do as u direct but my metal trade responds invalid SL/TP and you say i would add 10pips at the previous day close price. so please lecture me on how to excape the invalid TP/SL and also how to make it work, i really want to test and see how it works .thanks so much and again if there was any other strategies that related to 50% gain kindly give me  links as well. waiting.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi Rahul,

Thanks for posting your charts, and for providing additional SL/TP information. It's all very helpful.

Can you please explain further how you determine your SL/TP targets based on ATR? How did you decide on 40/80 for today?

Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Mate i must tell you i do not have a very large portfolio since i am only 3 months old in forex i do not look for 100plus pips, i am happy with a 100 or below pips in a day. Usually i look for 75-100 pips in a day. So i use a 1:2 Risk/Reward Ratio.

Regards,

Bksujal

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Oh, I'm a little confused.

I thought you were somehow using the ATR to determine your exact TP target. I understand the 1:2 SL.

I am also not looking to make a killing every day, just happy with steady daily gains. It is much easier to make smaller gains than bigger ones.

Thanks!

Last week i was to commence Demo on this Daily 95pips method, but i had a problem placing orders. Some one in the forum -Syafi helped me out by directing me to a link at efxgroup. I spent the last few days looking at the orders materials and also following all you guys contributions.Now i tried placing my orders today and i still encounter the response "invalid S/L and T/P". Below are my figures, someone should pls look it up and tell me the problem. My Time zone is GMT +1. So at fifteen minutes to 5est  on my chart GBP/USD High -2.0265, Low-2.0141.

These were my exact figures , starting with the first one on buystops the orders was rejected. Will good people in the forum including   mikelath,  and Syafi to respond.

Check with your broker. They might have restrictions regarding the distance of the SL and TP from your order.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi inspiredcapi.

Bullrock is correct in that it basically comes down to what facility your broker provides. You will need to check with them.

For the sake of testing this strategy on a demo account, Oanda has a useful trading platform suitable for this purpose.

Hi,

Weekend is coming, so we can polish that strategy using backtesting

Attached indicator might me useful, it just draws the bands for entry (with fixed pips shift or per cent of last day's range shift - bksujal's idea).

--- 帖子 #209 ---
bullrock,

Why daily ATR with 14 period?

I think that 1H ATR(24) would fit best as we take average true range for the last day.

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Maybe, I will verify your assertion and will post the results.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Although it's always a good idea to speak with your broker when you're having problems, I don't think broker restrictions is the problem here. No broker will stop you from placing trades where your TP or SL is 25 pips or more. Doesn't make sense. One thing to double-check is that your order expiry date is actually set for some period in the future.

It's also possible that your account is not set up properly in the first place, or some files have become corrupted within your software. If this is the case, I suspect you would be unable to enter ANY trade at all!

Can you enter a regular market order (instant execution)? If not, I would re-run your setup program (MQ4setup.exe or something similar), and when it asks you if you are willing to receive your broker's newsletters, you must say "yes." Then, try it again, and if it still doesn't work, contact your broker and report the problem.

Let us know how you make out.

Hope that helps...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
No its not better. ATR(24) just tell what is the hourly average during the last 24 hours and its a smoothed average. What we need the full daily range. Well I thought it is better to take the daily average of the last two weeks. I might be wrong.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
You're right.

I was thinking about measuring previous day's volatility using ATR definition -  the greatest of: high-low, day before close-high, day before close-low.

Than use percentage of it (e.g. 10%) above last day high (or below low) for setting buy/sell stop orders.

Date: Monday 3 September

GBPUSD  no touch

GBPJPY   no touch

USDJPY  no touch

EURJPY  no touch

EURGBP  -10

EURUSD  -20

Total:  -30pips

Comment: Another slow Monday, this time attributed to US Labour Holiday. So there was very little activity. The only pairs that triggered were EURGBP and EURUSD,and it happened late in the session. Thus these trades were manually closed before the new orders were placed.

Date: Tuesday 4 September

GBPUSD +95

GBPJPY +95

USDJPY breakeven

EURJPY +95

EURGBP -90

EURUSD +40

Total: +235pips

Comment: It's nice to see the pairs breaking out again and getting back into the swing of things !  The USDJPY short trade reached the 1st PT before retracing to stop out the remaining 2 lots. It then proceeded to trigger the long orders, reaching the 1st PT and I then manually closed out the remainder to make way for the new days orders, thus resulting in a breakeven scenario. The EURUSD short trade reached the 2nd PT and I manually closed out the remainder.

Date: Wednesday 5 September 2007

GBPUSD -25

GBPJPY -75

USDJPY -69

EURJPY -45

EURGBP no touch

EURUSD +63

Total:  -151pips

Comment: Days like these are a good reminder of the downside potential. Both long and short orders were triggered on GBPUSD, GBPJPY and USDJPY, with only partial profits achieved before retracing and stopping out. I can only conclude that using multiple profit targets help to hedge the positions.

Date: Thursday 6 September 2007

GBPUSD +45

GBPJPY -45

USDJPY -90

EURJPY -45

EURGBP -90

EURUSD +60

Total: -165pips

Comment: This weeks ranging market continues to play havoc with this system. Breakouts from the previous days high or low are only proving sufficient to trigger the trades before retracing back within the daily range.

I've started to adopt moving the stop on the 50TP trade to breakeven after the first 2 profit targets have been reached. Thus the better result for GBPUSD. Currently -156pips overall for the week.

Date: Friday 7 September 2007

GBPUSD +95

GBPJPY +50

USDJPY +5

EURJPY +5

EURGBP +25

EURUSD +95

Total: +275pips

Comment: A nice way to end the week. GBPYJPY, USDJPY and EURJPY had both long and short entries triggered. Later in the session the release of the Non Farm Payroll economic report gave a boost to the breakouts. Manually closed out remaining 2 lots on EURGBP (again). Based on the results I may have reason to smile again.

Total for week ending Friday 7 September 2007: +164pips

Total for week ending Friday 31 August 2007: +585pips

Hi all.

The individual pair results for the week ending Friday 7 September 2007 are:

GBPUSD +210

GBPJPY +25

USDJPY -154

EURJPY +10

EURGBP -165

EURUSD +238

Total:  +164pips

For the past 2 weeks:

GBPUSD +65

GBPJPY +200

USDJPY +16

EURJPY +325

EURGBP -115

EURUSD +258

Total: +749pips

Comment: Not bad for 2 weeks worth of trading. Based on performance and the overall behaviour of EURGBP in that it doesn't seem to be as volatile as the other pairs, it will be the first on the chopping block. I may replace it with USDCHF which is an opposite correlative pair to EURUSD.

Hi guys,

i'm a young italian trader, you can explaine to me what is the ATR that you use to set the size of your T/P? It's an indicator, or an EA? Or a simple formula? If is an indicator or an EA can you post it in this thread? Thanks in advance.

Giovanni.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Mikelath your setandforget system is really amazing.

I tested it from today in a demo account with all six pairs with success and i try on real my account only EURUSD with a full 90 pips take. your results too are very strong and promising. I use a trailing stop of 25 too in the pending orders with 50 of T/P, to save loss. I start your system at 23:00 (GMT+1) when Dowjones close (i think correspond to 5 EST). I use too only 17 hours precedents to  the start of the system, i think is more accurate than 24 hours.

More compliments for your job, mikelath. Sorry for my english...

Sincerely,

Giovanni.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi Rahul,

regarding your stop loss and target you use 1:2 ratio, that is clear to us.

the question is what type of ATR you use and percentage of it to determine SL and T for daily entries.

which currency pairs you trade now?

thanks.

Malinga

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Thanks for sharing the EA.

On which timeframe does the EA runs? and do you just attach it to a chart like GBPUSD?

hi, bksujal

i have been following your method and i am very interested in this.

the part i would realy appreciate is in the clarification of atr for the

pt and sl. i am sorry but i am still confused.

you said from looking at the atr your stop was 40 pips to reward @ 80 pips.

could you give an example of exactly what did to come up with these figures.

is this atr you are talking about an indicator and if so what is the parameters

(is it hourly or daily)and how exactly are you determining the tp and sl from this.

i have seen the charts you have posted and i dont see any indicator

besides the rsi,over bought and oversold.

and also since you have rsi,over bt,and over sld indicators on your charts

are you using them in any way to make your determination for the trades.

and one last question how are you dealing with the weekend.

are you using the friday values or are you including the sunday values too.

it would be very interesting to see your setup for mondays.

any help would be greatly appreciated.

thanks for sharing your knowledge,i am always eager to read your post keep

them coming.

would you let me send you an email for clarification for my setups

thanks a lot in advance.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Everyone seems confused about the Atr(14) guys i just use to determine the range thats it just to check the volatilty of the pair. And yes i use the friday's values for the new week. Ok i do sometime use rsi or other indicators but this is mainly my strategy and i have no indicator with it.

The pairs this most works in:

Eur/Jpy

Gbp/Usd

Someone asked me exactly how i decide my tp and sl as i have said i just aim for about 70-100 pips and use a 1:2 reward/risk ratio.

hi guys

this is one of the most interested thread i have seen, bksujal i wanted to ask something abt you method

1) why 10% of ATR? what is the theory behind it?

2) have you traded this method with trending market or just range market or doesn't matter.

and keep those posting coming guys . i will start testing both of the method from today. will post the results

cheers

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Sameer as i have said before i just use the Atr to determine the range thats it. Where did the 10% come from. Well this has worked me in trending and range markets fortunately till now.

Since your starting this strategy let me remind draw vertical lines from 17et to 17 et and then calculate the prevous period(17-17) high-low= range take 10% of range minus from the high and add to the low. It is important to note where the day has ended if it is near to the high's we would be only looking for a short trade and if it ends nearer to the lows then we would be looking to go long.

mikelath:

wat high low you take on monday, is it of last friday or sunday ?

cheers

--- 帖子 #229 ---
hi sameer.

Good question.

To simplify, in post#1 I've suggested using the previous 17 hrs of data at 5pmEST.However, Monday is a different story, and I'll need to edit post#1 in this regard.

Today I've realised that firstly the above approach is not really applicable on Monday's. Using Friday's data would be the simplest. That being said, we need to consider that sometimes there is significant activity over the weekend, and that sometimes price has already broken above or below the previous days high or low.

I'm also finding that my broker ( Oanda ) has wide spreads at the time I usually place the orders for Monday. So, I need to wait until the spreads reduce first.

So yes, we need to adjust for Monday's trading.

Personally, I am using the previous 17hrs from when I'm due to place the orders(when the spread reduces) on Monday back to Friday, excluding weekend data.

The idea is to be consistent.

The rest of the weeks trades will be as per post #1.

Hi all.

For newcomers to this thread I'd just like to clarify that there are 2 systems being discussed throughout this thread:

1.) Daily95pips -  as per post#1

This system is suited to a trending market.

2.) bksujal - post#138 onwards.

This system is suited to a ranging market.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
hi mike, thanks for posting your system and for testing the system on the forum. I was just curious about when do you close out your orders. do you close them at the end of the day if they get triggered and dont hit the TP's?

thanks again for your work.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
hi  Bksujal, thanks for your observations on the market. I would like to know how do you determine when the market is ranging vs. trending to put your system to use or do you use it everyday?

thanks.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Here is what I do. When the H/L is broken I enter as per the rules @ post #1. Say longs have been executed .... Menwhile on another account (or same account if hedging is possible) I enter stopsell orders as per the rules of Bksujal.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
That's because whatever indicator is on your mind it cannot tell whther it is ranging or trending. It can tell later (lagging). So I never try to guess what the heck wants to happen. Money management saves my a***.

yes

hey guys i hope everyone has earned some good pips in eur/jpy my favourite pair as you see the previous day's range was 260 so the 10%  of 260 is 26 pips since the day had ended near the lows we would go long @ 155.96 that is ( the low 155.7+26 pips) and the high of the pair till now has been 156.92 so almost a 100 pips!!!

Happy trading

Regards

Yep. I started demo trading GBPUSD and EURJPY as per your ranging strategy and locked in +40pips on EURJPY. Cable has triggered so we'll see where it ends up. As I'm not sure about the use of ATR and ascertaining different PT and SL for each pair I'm using a set 40 T/P and 25 S/L.

GBPJPY would also have been a great range trade today.

Ive been following this thread for a while now and am going to try out this method on a practice account.  Forgive me if this has been asked before, but when do you place your orders for the next day? if you draw your lines at 17est-17est on the previous day, do you immediately place your orders for the next day or is one time better than another? Also, how do you personally figure out the range for the previous day, just subtract the low from the high? Thats how ive been doing it, i was just curious if there was another way or a better way to do it.

Keep up the great work!

--- 帖子 #241 ---
thanks for the replies guys. bullrock, do you use a specific piece of software to test the various strategies?

bksujal, say the market is ranging and has gone long the previous day and you are looking to go short for the current day. what do you do if the close of the market is already above the 10% of the previous day's range applied to the low?

thanks guys

--- 帖子 #242 ---
This happens to me since I started testing this. I get home well after 5 est from work. I just set a buy or sell limit and they have been filled each time on a retrace. If it does not retrace...oh well you can trade another day.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
how long you'll be testing this mikelath ???

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Attach it to whatever pair and timeframe you want. EA uses current chart settings.

It uses original mikelath's rules (post #1). Currently I'm backtesting different variations (from bksujal, bullrock, mike and me  ).

--- 帖子 #245 ---
As someone asked about 5 p.m. Et, yes after you determine the range and take the 10% of it. Add the 10% of the range to the previous day's low and that is our entry point for the day to go long. Subtract 10% of the previous day's range to the previous day's high that is our entry for the day to go short. Remember if the day ends near to the lows we would only look to go long and if it ends near to the high's then we would look to go short only. And yes we would place our orders immediately after doing all the calculations and then placing our orders.

what time did you enter your eur/jpy order for today?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
hi guys

sorry bksujal for adding to questions coming but how do u get TP out of ATR ?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hey sameer i just use the Atr to determine the range thats it. Not to decide for the tp's.  I have a usual target around 75-100 pips. And today i placed my order at 17:30 Et.

Bksujal

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi bksujal!

I like what I see with your trading strategy. Since the market ranges 80% of the time, it only makes sense, that once the price reaches resistance points that it will attempt to return to equilibrium rather than continue towards a breakout (80% of the time). So, it would seem the odds are with you.

Last night I used your trading style for the first time to gain 50 pips on the EUR/JPY. Can't wait for tonight to trade, again.

I have been successful with both the D20P strategy and the 95Pips strategy. I prefer your 1:2 risk to reward ratio over the others...hope the profits hold up. Your trading style has been characterized as a "ranging strategy" as opposed to the 95Pips strategy as a "trending strategy". I don't see that description as being all that relevant as the EUR/JPY has been "ranging" around 200 pips per day. It's not a classic retrace or pull back trade, either. So...what do we call your style of trading?

Could you please provide us with the exact SL and TP levels for each currency pair that you are trading? Last night I used 30 SL and 50TP which isn't exactly your 1:2 ratio. If you post your parameters, I promise to behave, tonight.

Much appreciated

Do you mean yesterday at 1730ET?

And sorry for the newbie question, but can you tell me how to get the range from the ATR?

Will subtracting the previous high from the previous low give you the same number?

for instance, in post #140 you posted the high was 158.96 and the low was 156.77, for 10% you got 21.9

if you subtract the low from the high you get 2.19, which if you move the decimal out, you would get the same

number.  I guess my question is, will this work? or is using the ATR better, and how can you read that

from the ATR? Its a new indicator for me, as i normally just just stochs and MACD.

Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
ATR is the range, for example ATR is 0.0117 , so the average range is 117pips. i hope that helps

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi Bksujal,

I calculated the exact same long entry as you. Unfortunately, I had to leave around 15:30 EST, so I placed my limit order about an hour earlier and turned off my computer thinking not much would occur until 1700. Boy, was I wrong! When I returned later I found that my buy order had been filled at 15:29, and price dropped fast to hit my -40p SL at 15:55. Just my luck!

I'll try not to do that again. Looks like everyone is making pips but me!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Please remember 17 Et to 17 Et only nothing before or after that

Regards,

Bksujal

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Good advice, thanks!

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Ok, could someone check and see if i got this correct?

For Eur/Jpy from 17EST yesterday til 17EST today i got:

high - 156.36

low - 155.16

a range of 12 (156.36 - 155.16 = 1.2 or 12) should be 10%

It closed near the high so we are looking to go short.

So the order would be 156.36 - 12 = 156.24

Would this be correct?

Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Computernick,

You're way off.

First of all, to clarify the time, 17 (or 1700, or 17:00) is the same as 5:00 PM.

My numbers look like this:

High    157.36

Low     155.14

Range  222 pips

10%      22

Entry short    157.36 - 22 = 157.14

Your numbers might vary by a pip or two depending on your broker.

Hope that helps...

--- 帖子 #257 ---
hi guys

does this work for cable aswell

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thanks for the reply, I do understand the time from 5pm est the previous day til 5pm est close current day.

I must have looked at it wrong or something and was off a digit (156 instead of 157)

and that would have thrown off my range (157.36 - 155.14 = 2.22 or 10% 22)

So i see how you came up with that number now, sorry for the stupid user error, but i guess i did have the right formula to get the correct entry if i could just read the charts better ;-)

I did have a low of 155.16, so that must be a difference in the broker (i use forex.com)

Thanks for the help, i really appreciate it.

Hi people.

I feel honoured to 'host' on this thread what is potentially a great strategy shared with us by bksujal. I too have started demo trading it.

I will continue to post results for Daily95pips and will also add my results from bksujal's system. So far I've only traded EURJPY and GBPUSD with 40TP and 25SL. I'll add GBPJPY and may adjust  TP and SL levels as I go.

Results for this week are as follows:

Daily95pips.

Date: Monday 10 September 2007

GBPUSD -90

GBPJPY no touch

USDJPY no touch

EURJPY no touch

EURUSD -15

Total: -105pips

Comment: The cable trade only just triggered before retracing to the stop.

Manually closed out EURUSD.

bksujal system.

Date: Monday 10 September 2007

GBPUSD +31

EURJPY +40

Total: +71pips

Comment: A great ranging day. There were a lot more pips in the EURJPY than my 40TP, so may adjust levels or use mutliple profit targets in future. Will most likely add GBPJPY to the mix. Manually closed out GBPUSD trade.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Bksujal,

After you have calculated your entry point and are ready to enter your order, what if the price is already past your entry point?  The price may be still be biased towards the high or low of the previous 24 hours, but it could easily be past your entry point.  For instance, let's say you calculate a short entry point at 157.17 on Eur/Jpy but at 1700, the current price is 156.85.  Do you just place a market order at the current price, or skip trading that day?

Bruce

--- 帖子 #262 ---
HI Mike,

Maybe you can ad from time to time some clarifications on the systems, like in your post 230, but more precise.

We have 1)the original 95 pips strategy

2) the 95 pips enhanced by Bullrock ( not very clearly written, maybe he or you can clarify a little his last version and rules)

3) the Bksujal 50 pips strategy ( some more clarification on the s/l and t/p on the diferent pairs would be nice, maybe you can run 2 units on demo > one 20/40 and one 40/80?)

Dont they have the rest of the night (and day) to play out?

Have you ever lost pips with your system so far?

What win/lose ratio would you say you have gotten

from your method?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I think Bksujal's system is functional, based on chart obserations over the last month.  However, I believe there's a more conservative approach to consider that can yield 25+ pips per day.

Here it is:

Instead of focusing on the prior day's high & low, consider the prior day's close.  Thereafter, add 20% of ATR (5) for a long position and subtract 20% of ATR (5) for a short position.  Include TS of about 35, with a TP of 45 and a SL of 40.

Test it... it works...

Thanks,

Walt

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Jones247,

Is the ATR(5), the Hi and Lo over the past 5 periods on an hourly chart? Is that the last 5 hours Hi and Lo, then?

What testing have you done to determine the TS, SL and TP? Are you discarding bksujals'd 1:2 risk to reward ratio?

Please disclose more about your strategy.

Many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
hello guys good afternoon from here i hope many people have locked in some pips in eur/jpy my short trade entry was 157.12 and closed the position @ 156.40 a nice 72 pips and also earned in gbp/usd entered long @ 2.0265 and closed the position @ 2.0300 a nice 35 pips.

So my results for today are

Eur/jpy = 72 pips

Eur/Usd = 25 pips

Gbp/Usd = 35 pips

Someone asked about my win ratio well its a 100%!!! to be honest with you guys, but its important to know that i am just using this strategy since 2 weeks.

Bksujal

Hi vanupips.

You might want to ask Bullrock and Bksujal the above questions about their approaches.

If you have any questions regarding the Daily95pips strategy you're welcome to ask me.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi Bksujal,

I asked a question a few posts back, maybe you didn't see it.  I was wondering what you do in the case where at 17:00 the price is already past your calculated entry point?  Do you take the trade at the market?  For instance, I show on my charts that at 17:00 ET the E/J candle opened at 156.94 with a high of 156.95.  I had 157.12 calculated as the proper entry price as well.

Bruce

Hi jones247.

Thanks for the input.

This gives us all yet another system to trade. I can see the potential.

Enter 5 units (5 minilitots, 5 lots, 5*0.2 minilots, whatever).

Long: Prev days (Close at 22 GMT) High + 1 pip Short: Low - 1 pip

Take profit as follows 1st unit at 15% of the daily ATR(14) + Entry, 2nd unit at 30% of the daily ATR(14) and so on. Leave unit 5 till the end of the day if in profit or leave to the next day if in loss and SL hasn't been hit.. Enter next units as described.. (You can have many unit 5s if you do not close them consecutively). Move to breakeven the SL of ALL units if take profit 2 has been hit.

I have found an error in my calculations but the result doesn't changes much.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Sorry mate i didnt see your post before. I do not trade at the market price even though its below my entry price. I placed an order and thats it, fortunately it was executed and sucessful.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
One can have multiple SLs or modify the TP levels to be at pivot points, retracement levels, SR levels of trendline or moving averages. Everyone should work out what is best for him/ But the main thing with multiple TP levels we are trying to capture pips from the market even if it is spiking and the 5th extr unit is supposed to capture trending markets.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi Bksujal,

Thanks for the reply, but I'm a bit confused.  You put in your trades at 17:00 ET every day, right?  But based on the data on my charts, I don't see that I could have possibly gotten that price at that time.  It was already at 156.94 and went down from there.  Maybe there's a time discrepancy?  Are you in the US?  If not, what time in GMT do you place your trades?  Right now it's about 09:45 GMT and EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) is 05:45.  Currently, Eastern Time in the US is GMT -4 due to daylight savings time.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hey bruce i am gmt+4 and i place my trade at 17 et which is -4 GMT.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
What will happen if we open positions in opposite direction? Will we earn 85 pips daily?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
OK, so you place your trades at 21:00 GMT, which is 01:00 in your local time, correct?

Bruce

--- 帖子 #279 ---
sorry , i've read all the threads,but i don't undestand how do you use the atr indicator and, how do you decide to go long or short.

For the time now for you is about 10:40?

And you place the order at your 13:00?

Sorry again,

thank you

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Bruce, if I may, the way I have understood his posts to say is this: he waits for the daily candle to end at 5:00 pm eastern time in the US. As soon as he makes his calculations, he places his trades regardless of where the price is at the time. If the trade gets hit, fine. If not he does not trade. Hope this helps, and Bksujal correct me if I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Well that sucks, my entry point (which someone helped me with here) was 157.142 and never got executed, it was still waiting this morning when i got back to my computer. Guess ill try it again this afternoon and see what happens.  Should i close out my order or let it ride until 17est where i place new orders?

EDIT: they just got placed at 7:55est, i guess ill see how it plays out anyway on my demo.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi PipSnatcher,

Yes, I understand what he is saying, but when I saw the price today, something just didn't add up.  I looked at his sample charts where he drew the lines supposedly at 17:00 ET.  I compared them to my chart and I see that the times are 1 hour off.  In other words, what shows as 17:00 ET on his charts is really 16:00 EDT.  I think maybe his charts are not taking daylight savings time into account and are always showing EST.

I really like the system and I want to try it out.  I just want to be sure I've got the times right since they seem to be critical to getting the most pips.

Bruce

--- 帖子 #283 ---
So, if price is below (or above) your entry price @17:00....at what price do you place your order?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
You're right except that DST wouldn't account for it.

He has it marked off at 20:00 GMT.

Right now that is 1600 EDT (4PM). During EST that would be 1500 EST (3PM).

He must be under the impression that the time stamps on his chart indicate ET, when they actually don't.

EDIT- It just occurred to me what he's doing. He is showing 1H charts. The vertical lines are placed at the 20:00 GMT bar. The 20:00 GMT bar ends at 21:00. He computes his H and L between the vertical lines and places his trade at the opening of the next bar. That would be at 1700 EDT.

He is correct. His charts do not contradict what he has been saying.

Bksujal - How could you have an entry point in eur/jpy of 157.12 when the 18:00 EST candle started at 156.94? Price was never close to 157.12 after 17:00 EST.

Please advise...

T4K

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Well, I'm not having such great luck here, either.

On my charts, at 1700 EDT (it is, in fact, EDT, so I will continue to use that reference for accuracy), I entered a limit order to go short at 157.14. At 0100 this morning the price climbed up to 157.13, just 1 pip below my limit order, so no trade occurred. Later this morning, at around 0700, the price finally triggered my short but moved up a full 42 pips to knock me out with a SL of -40.

Very frustrating.  I'm not sure how our friend, bksujal was able to enter at 2 pips lower in order to have his short trade triggered when it did, when we're all using the same calculations. Even if his broker is quoting prices 5 pips away, the same relationships exist, and the price at 0100 never met the entry order price.

On another day, he entered at 1730 instead of 1700, luckily catching the right price at that time.

Since a number of us seem to be experiencing a similar discrepancy, Bksujal, I must ask: Are you actually placing limit orders, or are you checking your charts after the fact to see how you would have made out, had you actually traded? Some people demo trade this way. It's not dishonest, but it's not an accurate representation.

Am I missing something here?

Can you help us out?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Sorry for the late reply. Okay now i had placed my order and thats it i did not go short when it was below my entry price. I just placed my order and waited for it to get executed.

Look at EUR/USD.

Making 25 pips on it is just downright impossible. Even accounting for differences in broker data feeds, it could not have happened using the rules he has given us.

GBP/USD at +35 is equally impossible. He would have been down 32 pips minimum before price even got close to 2.0300.

If he got out with 35 pips that means his PT was 35 pips.

Using his rules that means the SL was 17 or 18 pips. He would have been stopped out.

I'm sure he is being honest about his results. I am also sure that these results could not have happened using the method as he described it.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I was stopped out for a nice loss on my demo.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Im sure when you have a system that works for you, its hard to explain to someone else exactly what you do since you have been doing it for a while, but i still would love to try and figure out what exactly he is doing and how he is getting the figures he is getting.  Like many people here including me have asked, could someone please explain (with a chart if possible) how to get the range from the ATR? I guess im not the only one who has never used that indicator before.

Also, what broker do you use Bksujal?

And whoever is actually successful using Bksujal's method, what broker are you guys using as well.  Id be up to open a demo account with your broker just to see if its something with my broker or not.

Thanks for the help thus far and happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Obviously a good point.... And that would be the other strategy that is sell from the previous days high and buy from the previous days low....

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Unfortunately you do not get it.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
ATR = Average True Range ... That is a volatility inidcator and usually you can see it at the bottom of the screen.. The graph of it is irrevelant you just need the actual value for that day...

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Bksujal indicated he was using ATR(14) on an hourly chart.

This means he is looking at the 14 bar average of the average true range of the hourly candles.

In other words- he's looking at the hourly candle range averaged over 14 bars.

How he uses that, I don't have a clue. He must use it to calculate his PT and SL, but I don't know how.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
When people will understand that the strategy HOW YOU ENTER is IRREVELANT. What is important is your money and position management!!!. SLs TPs BEs and so on and how you manage them. EXIT is BY FAR THE MOST IOMPORTANT factor IMHO. This strategy in fact any other strategy can work if you have a sound money management, you are disciplined, patient, and have a consistent paln in place.... And you are able to protect your funds.

Have fun

--- 帖子 #300 ---
IMHO

i really think Bksujal system is a great one and little should be change to it. i think Money Management should be in to make it work better. hopefully..someone can share some like on the MM part.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
You may be right, but I don't think we know what his system is.

Once we find out what it is MM may improve it.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
i thought he said that we long or short base on daily high low??

i think MM will helps us to mins losses and win more.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Here we go

For example.

Risk on each trade no more than 1-3% of your account.. Like say the ATR(14) is 100 say your SL is 50% of that so you risk capital*3%/50 per point. Then you say if 50% of the ATR(14) in gain then you trail your SL to break even and you close 1/3 of you rpositions when 100% of the ATR(14) is your gain the you close further 1/3 of you positions. and leave the rest till the end of the day....

One approach

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Bksujal...you are da bomb!

Trading has worked like a charm! Made 50 pips from EUR/JPY bksujal entry order trades each of the last two days. Used 30SL. Oanda is my dealer platform. Last night's trade was triggered after midnight CDT to the exact pip @ 157.12 long. Did not enter any dealer spread which may be throwing some of you off. I am entering 50 pip TP, because bksujal said this strategy should deliver 50 pips a day, and that his favorite pair is the EUR/JPY.

Bksujal, can you please explain how you determine SL and TP levels on the four currency pairs you seem to be trading?

Why are the entry levels @ 10% less than previous day's Hi and 10% more than the Lo? Is 10% anything more than an arbitrarily chosen number?

So no matter where the current price is @ your trade time, you place a limit order, and if your entry level is filled you have a trade, and if the price doesn't touch your entry level, there is no fill and no executed trade?

Thanks for all your help!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Sorry...one more question, Bksujal.

You have stated that when the current price at trade time is close to the Hi, you place a short trade only, and vice versa for the Lo.

What determines close proximity to the Hi or Lo? If the price is hovering near mid-point do you straddle a trade from both Buy and Sell entry levels? Or if the price is merely one pip closer to the HI, is that enough to make a Sell trade only?

Much obliged.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I think I see what happened yesterday on the E/J.  He could have put in an short entry limit order at 17:00 EDT for 157.12.  The price was below that at the time, but 8 hours later, I show a candle that did go up and touch 157.12 which would have triggered the order.  On the next candle it went down 81 pips which accounts for his profit.

So, it looks to me like if you are indicating that you should only do short orders, if the price is below your entry price at 17:00, then put in an entry limit order and if the price is above your entry point, put in an entry stop order.

Now I feel much less confused.  I'm anxious to try this today on demo.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Bobcat,

You went long last night?

Bksujal's method called for us to go short, since the most recent price was closer to the high of the day.

Jeff

--- 帖子 #308 ---
K2KV,

You are absolutely correct...I should have said a Sell limit order as per your correction! My bad...sorry! I was of course thinking of the Hi entry level, but I needed to have stated that would necessitate a Sell order.

Thanks for your correction!

Bobkat

--- 帖子 #309 ---
The EUR/JPY can be explained. I would have been stopped out on it, but that could have been because of differences in broker data.

Now, try explaining +25 pips on EUR/USD and +35 on GBP/USD.

No way. He has to be using rules other than what he has indicated

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Mikelath, your results for today?

I trade the 95Daily today in all your six pairs in a demo and the results is not good for today.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I guess we are all just starting to learn bksujal's trading strategu. Truth be known, I have made several inquiries with no responses, so I am disappointed with the comminication aspect. In all fairness, bksujal neither promised to divulge everything, nor provide support. Regardless, I am grateful for what he has provided, so far.

Having said that, I took a look at last night's GBP/USD trade. The strategy called for Buy @ 2.0268. The market topped @ 4AM CDT @ 2.0330 for a 62 pip profit, if you got it all.

I did not look at the Eur/USD, but between EUR/JPY and GBP/USD, this looks, indeed, very promising.

Bobkat

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Yes, but you would have been down over 32 pips before you hit any profit at all.

According to him he has a 1:2 risk reward ratio. He has repeated that several times.

If he targeted a PT of 35 pips, he had to have a Stop Loss of 17 or 18 pips. He would have been stopped out.

Hi Billbss,

Yesterday's bksujal EUR/JPY Buy signal was filled @ 2.0268. My chart shows the low @ 2.0263 which is only 5 pips, not 17 or 18. If true, he would not be stopped out.

The truth is that bksujal may also have manually closed out his trade and not relied on the TP to end the trade.

I wish that he would give us some more insight as to how he trades, because the finer points are open to speculation, and we can easily have far different results from one another.

Best regards,

Bobkat

I was talking about the GBP/USD being stopped out.

I can go along with the profit on the EUR/JPY although I would have been stopped out using my broker.

If he closed it manually, then he is using some other method. The method he described here did not mention manually closing a trade- not that I can find.

Hi people.

I feel honoured to 'host' on this thread what is potentially a great strategy shared with us by bksujal. I too have started demo trading it.

I will continue to post results for Daily95pips and will also add my results from bksujal's system. So far I've only traded EURJPY and GBPUSD with 40TP and 25SL. I'll add GBPJPY and may adjust TP and SL levels as I go.

Results for this week are as follows:

If someone could verify this for me again, so i can see if i got it correct this time:

Eur/jpy

hi - 158.22

lo - 156.30

range = 192 10% = 19

ended hi so go short 158.22 - 19 = 158.03 entry point

am i off again or does this look correct?

Thanks again for the verification.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
That's within 3 pips of what I got.

I use FXDD. The brokers can vary that much.

Be sure you didn't take the high from the 1700 bar.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Ok computernick, is right your entry point. with my broker is 158.00.

I'm in NZDJPY and GBPUSD with the bksujal.

Good lucK!

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I took the high on the 1700 bar. Is that wrong?

158.22? the next highest would be 158.17 (forex.com broker)

the lower high would drop the range to 18.7 which would round

to 19, which would be the same as i had before.

158.22-19=158.03 entry point right?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Yeah, that's wrong. The orders should be placed at 1700.

The 1700 bar begins at 1700.

My high was 158.19. 158.17 is well within the ballpark.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
hi spawn,wat entry do u have on gbp/usd

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Ok thanks for clarifying, i guess i got lucky tonight and came up with similar numbers.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Are you using ATR5 on the daily chart with the close of the daily candle?  Or at the close of the 1h 1700est candle?  Also, are you setting both the long and short orders or just one?  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi Vincenzo, my entry is 2.0324, at the moment i have made 34 PIPS, with a TS ready at entry point.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
hi guys

done some thinking abt the both systems and here are my thoughts.

mikelath system:

it is a gr8 system but the problem i think need to refine is say the market breaks high+5 then retraces 50 pips then goes up again. and same goes for low + 5. if we increase the difference from high by adding more pips the issue is still there unless there is a strong uptrend or downtrend.

bksujal system:

the whole soul of the system is that tomorrow market will do opposite of the close, which can be true and false but depends on market conditions. but relaying solely on the fact tomorrow will be opposite is kinda doesn't add up.

i will keep thinking if any solution comes to my mind i will post them

good day

cheers

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi CMartin,

I'm refining my numbers... stay tuned... There are two factors that we can rely on: (1) the prior day's close will be about the same as the new day's open; (2) Depending on the currency pair, it will range 90 - 160 pips during a 24 hour period. Instead of using the ATR (5), I'm taking the prior day's close, then adding 15 pips to determine the long entry position, while subtracting 15 pips to determine the short entry position. Because I do not know which direction it will trend during the next 24 hours, I enter both orders. Depending on the daily range pattern of the currency pair. My SL will range from 30 pips to 60 pips, while the corresponding TP will range from 40 pips to 70 pips. My intent is to hold the positions for up to multiple days if necessary.

Upon reviewin my results from yesterday, I noticed that if I had a LARGE SL (i.e. > 60), I would have obtained my TP on 7 of 8 trades, which each currency pair having 2 trades each (1 - long & 1 - short). The problem was that I got stopped out before the retracement occurred.

A classic example for a large SL occurred on 9/7/07 @ 1:29 GMT, when I entered a long position on 4 lots of EURJPY. Subsequent to that entry, my floating loss reach more than $4,000, as I had no SL. However, by today, 5 days later, they completely retraced to my TP of 25 pips. I think that it's best to have a SL, but in this case any SL less than 100 would have been to my detriment.

Currently, I'm focusing on GBPJPY, GBPUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, EURJPY...

Walt

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I don't think bksujal's system quite says that tomorrows market will do the opposite of the close.

For a short, it says that if tomorrows market approaches today's high by a certain number of pips, it will retrace a certain number of pips.

How many pips it will retrace is anybody's guess. We can't get that out of him yet.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Thanks for the explanation Walt!  I look forward to more of what you are working on here.

Chris

--- 帖子 #330 ---
yes but we are depending on retracement rite. but wat if the pair moves 60pips then retraces 30 pips just for example instead of 60 pips loses we are at 30 pips loses.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks for the indicator, very useful, it does all the calculations and exactly shows where to enter

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I dont know what im doing wrong, but gby/jpy killed me last night TP/SL of 50/25, i saw i was up 15 pips on eur/jpy, and this morning it seems im in the hole that many.

There has to be something im doing wrong, as it doesnt seem anyone else is losing money on this system. Could it be my broker? (forex.com)

--- 帖子 #333 ---
On GBP/JPY, any stop loss below 100 pips and you are sure to lose.

Look at the daily ATR5 and use 70% of that as your stop

--- 帖子 #334 ---
hey guys had a good day today my results are:

Eur/Jpy = 15 pips with 3 lots

Usd/Jpy = 30 pips with 3 lots

Happy Trading,

I am off for a week, was very busy these 2 days so was not possible to attend to all questions sorry for that. If any questions then please pm me.

Regards,

Bksujal

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thanks bksujal for your sharing, I like your method and I'm practicing it but I still don't know when to exit the trades, how to use ATR, that is the only problem for me. Can you explain it better please?

Regards,

Mari

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Bksujal, don't use always the same system. For example today in the pairs with JPY his system lose in SL. If he had gain today, is not thanks to his system show in this thread. This is not a system, because he decide arbitrarily what SL and TP to use.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
The markets dictes how how pips there are to gain. If you are in a tight range, how can you expect to get a lot of pips. So he comes in and checks the charts and see it's not moving or stalled. Better to get out with some profits than to have it go against you. The market is dymantic, not static! Look at chart patterns in different timeframes. Look for support and resistances zones. All these have an effect on TP and SL. Not to mention your own tolorenace for risk. It's a method for getting you into the market. It's up to you when to decide to get out.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
This is correct, mrnando.  In fact, i consider the Bksujal contribution as an "indicator" to set your entry in the market instead of a real method.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I am in a EUR/JPY SELL @ 158.79, 30SL, 60TP. Anyone with me?

Bobkat

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I got 158.77 and am down almost 11 pips as we speak.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
'

I'm in it, for real. 20 SL, 30 TP. Not delighted thus far...

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I'm in too. Entry: 158.78  SL:41  TP:82 TS:41. I'm in EURUSD too with the bksujal's approach.

Good PIIIPPPS.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
you really expect to get 82pips TP?

its down 14 right now and we are going against the trend...

im a little nervous, this is my first live trade with this system....

my demo eur/usd trade is also not doing well....dont know where your getting pips from....

--- 帖子 #344 ---
80 pips seems a bit ambitious...

I'm down around -8, with 10 lots (!). Problem is, I have to get out of here in a little while, and will have to close my trade with a loss. I just won't leave this one running.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
well you could figure out how much you are willing to lose and make a stop loss.  im giving it 30pips, which at the moment it looks to be turning around.

**fingers crossed**

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Calm guys,

if yoy want to get pips, you must don't be NERVOUS, for sure. I follow what the ATR speak, and this is the live situation of the market. ATR show a SL of 41 and i apply a 1:2 ratio to my SL/TP, don't forget that i have too a TS of 41 that protect me in case of return of the trend. That's all.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Please excuse my ignorance, but can you explain how to read the ATR? I never use that indicator and would love to know how. When you say the ATR shows a SL (SL means Stop Loss?) of 41, how are you getting that? If you could supply a chart that would be even better!

Thanks for the help.

EDIT: for example my ATR14 says the ATR is at 0.07, how are you reading that to be SL 41?

at 1700 it was at 0.10

Please advise.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
The ATR is a very important indicator that show you the volatility of the market and give a real time coefficient in the chart. This numer (for example 0,0017) can be use to set a realistic and reliable SL, simply multiplying this number with your entry (if near the current value of the pair).

What indicates volatility? the line going up or down or how high the number is? how does .07 mean its volatile? the number its at right now.

im not understanding you.

EDIT: and to top it off the eur/jpy has hardly moved and im still sitting at -10pips.

What are your trades at? how long do you think you have to hold them to be profitable?

I figured the retracting would have already happened already.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Just check the attachments "Wojciech Jarmulski" posted on earlier. I have been working with that as the start of my own. The trick to me appears to be picking the appropriate stop and takes. Trying to work out a method of programtically generating these values so the EA adapts to the market conditions. Thats a bit harder than I expected

--- 帖子 #358 ---
i join you.. but i only doing demo.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi Mikelath,

I believe you may be short circuiting yourself with such a small SL.  Many of your pairs would require a SL of 70 - 100+ pips.  You'll be better off setting a huge SL with a TP of 50% of your SL.  Or perhaps you could still utilize the three trades with TP of 15, 30, & 50.

Try adjusting your SL to a higher number and let us know what you think.

Thanks,

Walt

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Just started trying this system. Yesterday made 67 pips on uds/jpy(trailing stop on 3rd lot) Today -90 pips, entry point was 114.42 which was close to the top of our time period at the time I placed the orders. Is there a spread we should be at from the top or bottom if we are close at the time we place orders(5 EST)?

Thanks,

rion

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I'm new and I hope no question is stupid. Would someone please define what and how to indentify a ranging market and a trending market?

This is great, I have learned more here is a few days then in most of what I have done.

At the moment i see in my demo account that the Daily95 today have big loss. Not a good week for now.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
lost.. sigh...

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Well I set my TP for 1pip just to get the heck out of that trade and luckily it was hit overnight and i didnt lose anything on my live account. If i had bought instead of sold eur/jpy id be a rich man this morning. I guess this is just one of those times when bk's system doesnt work, the retract was hardly anything.

Spawn - how did your trade come out?

EDIT: Actually mikes system might have been a winner last night since the market was more trending than ranging....

--- 帖子 #365 ---
In EURJPY i take the SL. While in EURUSD the bksujal approach work well today. The mikelath method today is a disaster, at the moment (EURJPY, USDJPY, GBPJPY and EURUSD exit to a triple SL).

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Why don't you combine the two... Buy/sell on breakout from the high/low... If it retraces from the high/low 10 or whatever percent sell.. Or use two accounts/....

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Okay everyone,

I have decided to make an EA, I'll try my best. If someone can explain the system again, for me, with all the modifications, i'd be happy to start coding.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Which system are you referring to, Oksana.  Your willingness to code an EA is most appreciated.  Mikelath's system is laid out quite well in post 1; however, I'm not sure what BK's system is, as his results and exit strategy seems to change from trade to trade.

Walt

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Mikelath,

Try backtesting and forward testing with 100 pips SL.  I believe that most of your loses would have turned profitable if they had a little more breathing room.

Walt

--- 帖子 #374 ---
It was mainly a joke, but hey you could try it out and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
hehehe...ok, ok. Yeah, I know...we've gotta laugh right ?

I've been holding off adjusting the TP and SL levels mainly due to money management and risk/reward considerations.

Yes, you are absolutely right though. If the results are not good, we have to adjust SOMETHING. There's no use in cutting our losses by having tighter stops when all we get are more losses.

I could use larger stops and it probably will increase the profitability, though it will also increase the potential losses.

This past week has been a shocker though I still think it may be too early to start changing things too much.

This system losses to much.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Good work, Mike!   You'll get on the road to forturne soon or later with such consistent work.

But one question, (sorry if it's explained, i lost the track of every post)

Do you now use the 4th lot to run on a trailing stop? I understand there are 3 lots respectively for long and short, but another smart guy "billrock" mentioned the profits may increase much by adding a 4th lot with a trailing stop.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I have made some statistical analysis. Here are the HARD FACTS. Probabilities or odds if you wish. You remeber? I always stress.

Now here is the problem

Out of 2073 days analysed of the GU.

The probability that it will reach 15 pips from previous high is 831 to 199

The probability that it will reach 30 pips from previous high is 641 to 389
The probability that it will reach 50 pips from previous high is 439 to 591

See the problem??? It is 57% probable that it will !!NOT!! reach the 50 pips from top... Now we also have an extra 5 pips.

DOOMED to FAILURE if you do not push the SL to BE when the second TP has been hit. It is even better if there is a fourth unit to increase the odds... The mas rise from previous high during this analysed period was 359 pips in a single day. Are you going to leave that on table. Nope. 4th unit is the answer.

Regards

Bullrock or "Billrock"

Based upon my visual observation of the daily candles over the last 3 months, only 1 out of every 5 - 8 trades results in a loss under the following conditions: (1) SL: 100; (2) TP: 30 - 50 (depending on currency pair); (3) No trailing stop; (4) allow for swing trading (1 or more days) before TP is reached; (5) enter long at prior day's high + 5 pips & enter short at prior day's low - 5 pips.

I've observed that about 60% - 67% of the daily candles have trended in accordance with the prior day close. In other words, if the prior day's candle closed higher than its opening, then the next day's candle will have a 60% - 67% probability for also closing higher than its opening, which was the closing price of the prior day.

Simply taking advantage of this pattern can easily yield four wining trades out of every five trades, or better.  Based on standard lot sizes, that's a profit of about $800 - $1,000 for every 5 trades - per day or per week.

I have been testing the following currency pairs: GBPJPY, USDJPY, EURJPY, USDCHF, & GBPUSD.

Please let me know if your backtesting or forward testing supports this assertion...

Thanks,

Walt

Wow ! We have some quality contribution from bullrock and walt (jones247).

THANKS GUYS

Bullrock, please excuse my ignorance. I assume GU refers to GBPUSD ?

If your stats pertain to cable only, then we should not rule out the probabilities for other pairs.  This strategy is obviously more suited to more volatile pairs that can provide big price moves. Take EURJPY for example.

When first concieving the idea of D95P I was more or less of the same view as you in that I was seeing so many more pips in the trades after I'd taken my 20pip or 30pip profit target. Thus I thought to have 3 targets to capture more pips. Your idea of a 4th TP with a trailing stop is very good.

The only reasons that I haven't yet adopted it myself is that firstly my broker Oanda doesn't provide trailing stops and secondly a 4th order will increase the total amount at risk, and from a money management perspective it may be more of a challenge...it also may not be...I just haven't explored it yet.

Wal, your observations are invaluable. I'll admit that I've been purposely holding back from adjusting the system just to firstly see which of the pairs that I'm testing perfom well with this strategy. So far EURJPY and EURUSD are going well, though it's still early days.

Adjusting the stops to 100pips makes sense if it increases the probability of more winning trades. However, I am very cautious of risk/reward ratios, so that's why I've tried to keep it at approx.1:1. It seems that 30pips SL is too tight for pairs like GBPJPY, though my initial thought was that when pairs like this move they can virtually sky rocket or plummet in a short timeframe, breaking thru entry and profit targets without practically any retracements.This is where ANY stop loss would be superfluous, though of course still necessary.

As we've seen though, GBPYJPY HAS been retracing and stopping out. So yes, eventually we'll need to make adjustments for pairs like this.

Bullrock and Wal, myself and all those attending this thread will greatly appreciate if you include updated results of your approaches to this thread.

I've tried to be regular (more for my own clarity) in updating my results, and if you guys choose to be more committed to tweaking this strategy, then our combined efforts will certainly prove fruitful.

No offence. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THIS POST. There is a lot of information.

1. You're talking about the probability of the previous days close vs the todays close. I am talking about the size of the difference between previous days high and todays high and the probability of its size. That is a different context and calls for a different strategy

2. I've done precise calculations and it is not a visual observation. I don't trust my eyes.

3. You've analysed 3 months I have analysed 8 years. IMHO 3 months is not enough. You know the reason? One business cycle in the banking industry is 3 months (the larger traders of the currencies) So you need to analyse at least 1 year or even better to analyse 4-5 years which is 1 economic cycle. I wanted to analyse 2 economic cycles. That is 5-10 years.

4. I never trust "visual observations". Needs to be backed up by calculations.

So here they come:

I have analysed long and short. So if prev day up this day up probability. And if prev day down this day down probability. Your observation does not hold up in case of USDJPY in the last 3 months hold up for the 8 years and USDCHF does not hold up at all!!!

Notation:

L+ -> if prev day close higher today close higher

L- -> if prev day close higher today close lower (pattern failure)

S+ -> if prev day close lower today close lower

S- -> if prev day close lower today close higher (pattern failure)

GBPUSD

Total: (L+) 51.32% (L-) 48.68% (S+) 46.63% (S-) 53.37%

3 months (L+) 57.14% (L-) 42.86% (S+) 55.56% (S-) 44.44%

GBPJPY

Total (L+) 53.53% 46.47% (S+) 47.83% (S-) 52.17%

3 months (L+) 50.77% (L-) 49.23% (S+) 42.31% (S-) 57.69%

EURJPY

Total (L+) 54.68% (L-) 45.32% (S+) 46.52% (S-) 53.48%

We could use the ATR as a basis for calculations. I have to go now. Seeya tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
how do u suggested using ATR, bcoz to me and might be few other ppl ATR is really confusing, as it only gives movement, but the question in up direction or down or both combined.

cheers

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Cool

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Thanks again bullrock.

Providing such thorough analysis is certainly very professional.

I'm assuming the position of student here and must admit that I'm not really clear on what the above calculations mean and I'm sure I'm not the only one, so a little more clear explanation will be great.

Firstly, in point 1. ( 1. You're talking about the probability of the previous days close vs the todays close. I am talking about the size of the difference between previous days high and todays high and the probability of its size. That is a different context and calls for a different strategy) you seem to be indicating the use of either the 'trending' (D95P) or 'ranging' (bksujal) strategies as you've mentioned in previous posts.

So am I correct in assuming that the calculations that follow help us to determine which strategy to use for the day ?

Notation:

L+ -> if prev day close higher today close higher

L- -> if prev day close higher today close lower (pattern failure)

S+ -> if prev day close lower today close lower

S- -> if prev day close lower today close higher (pattern failure)

Again, could you please break this down for us so we can understand it fully ?

Oh, and regarding ATR; my understanding is that we use it to determine TP and/or SL for each individual pair. If there's more to it than that ( and please excuse me if it's been covered already) please incorporate it's use with the above calculations.

I must admit that I've never used ATR before so I'll need to investigate it further.

Thanks in advance

Hi Mr. Mikelath

Thanks for sharing D95 Pips system. I tried the system once using my virtual account and it was working fine. However, I came up with a serious problem. I humbly hope you (and also anyone in the forum) could help me solve my problem.

I am trading GBP/USD pair at the moment. The problem that I find is, when the movement is going downwards and touching BUY point (prevoius day’s High+5) I immediately open BUYING position at the market rate. Later, I find out that it is too risky to do that. What if the movement really stroke down to the SELL point and continued going down ?

The same problem also occurs when  the movement is going upwards and touching SELL point. I don’t know whether the movement ends around SELL area, or it’s still striking upwards.

How do I know that a movement really ends around BUY / SELL area and reverses its trend when it reaches BUY/SELL area ? when is about time to open a position ? If I could get this answer correctly, I can make a combination that will increase the probability of success up to 85 - 90%. I hope we all can enjoy the fruit of the system

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hi forexdummy.

Firstly, NO system can demand the market to conform to its parameters. In other words, we can never predict with 100% accuracy which way price will go.

The best we can do is devise a system based on probabilites provided by historical and forward tested data.

The D95P strategy is based on the probability of price continuing to our profit targets once it has moved beyond 5pips above or below the previous days high or low.

Some have mentioned that it has been historically shown that the market tends to 'range' (stay within the previous days high and low...or if it does breakout, retrace again within the previous days H and L) more than 'trend'(break above or below the previous days high and low and continue to trend). So according to this view, the probabilities are in favour of trading within the range of the previous day. You'll notice that discussion of BOTH approaches are contained in this thread.

Regarding your following statements:

'The problem that I find is, when the movement is going downwards and touching BUY point (prevoius day’s High+5) I immediately open BUYING position at the market rate.'

If price is going down we would expect the SELL orders to trigger, NOT the buy orders.

Please clarify ?

'Later, I find out that it is too risky to do that'

The risk is the total amount of our stop losses.

'What if the movement really stroke down to the SELL point and continued going down?'

If price triggers my SELL orders and continues to go down to my profit targets I will celebrate.

'The same problem also occurs when  the movement is going upwards and touching SELL point.'

You seem to be describing the 'ranging' strategy that bksujal has shared...?

Is your concern that what if BOTH buy and sell orders are triggered ?

I'm sorry...I'm not really sure what your question is?

If you haven't done so already, I encourage you to read thru all the posts...I know that as the thread progresses that increases the amount of reading...however, it can be worthwhile.

'I can make a combination that will increase the probability of success up to 85 - 90%.'

Hey, if you can do this then I'm with you all the way !

mike

Hi Bullrock,

I appreciate your technical analysis. Your data is very precise & detailed. However, you are not including a few variables that would change the percentage allocation for wins and losses. To use your terms (L+, L-, S+, S-), it's shortsighted to assume that all L- & S- equate to a loss. That is why a 100 pip SL is so important. With a SL-100 you can have a L- or a S-, but it can reverse to a L+ or a S+ within a few days as long as the SL was not reached. Another variable to consider is the fact that is some instances, although it may be a L- or a S-, the day's high or day's low was good enough to reach the TP before retracing to the L- or S-. Therefore, although it was a L- or S-, it was still a profitable day because it trended strong enough to reach the TP before reverting back to a L- or S-.

Once you factor in these other variables, I still believe that most of your trades in the trend will win 67% - 80% of the time with a TP-50 & SL-100.  I will try to provide emperical backtesting data to confirm my assertion.

Thanks,

Walt

Thank you Mr. Mike for your response

Sorry to make you confused about my question. I try to make it simpler. What I noticed when conducting a virtual trading with this system was :

1) The price occasionally, though not very often, moved downwards and touched the BUY POINT. Then it didn't break through the buy point. It was just reversing and going up. I have attached a screenshot from MT chart, hopefully it could help give you a picture of my question.

I found out during trading virtually, that if we can break this problem and solve it, we can increase our probability of getting net greens (profits).

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Sorry forexdummy, though your question still makes no sense to me.

With the Daily95pip strategy there are only 2 entry levels per day ie. 5 pips above the previous days high and 5 pips below the previous days low.

There is no possibility of price being above the long orders or below the short orders when they are placed, therefore there is no possibility of price moving downwards to a buy point.

If anyone else on this thread reads the question differently to me and can answer please do so.

mike

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi Bullrock,

According to your data and analyse, wouldn't the simplest way of trading be just to buy on up-days immediatly at the close of the candle(day), with T/P 20 pips and S/l 20 pips ,and sell on down days at the close with 20 pips T/P and S/L.

We would leave a lot of pips on the table some days, but that is not the goal, the most important is to score the more pips on a regular basis.

You most probably did allready some research on this idea?

regards,

vanupips

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Ok I will recalculate and consider your views.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
By the way L+,L-,S+,S- are not losses just statitical data answering the question how many times failed the pattern I haven't said anything about SLs TPs and so on. The other thing is that in my calculation I have compared the previous day is up so the today is up thing but that is wrong because I had to comapre the today closes up against the previous day which gives different results.

I am gonna post new calculations tonight.

Hi bullrock, what software do you use for analysis?

I have been enjoying the posts on this thread.  WRT Daily95 or BKSujal range system, what about using the GBP pairs such as GBPJPY, GBPUSD, GBPAUD, GBPCHF?  These are the big movers of the day.  I have found the EURUSD to be difficult to trade with these methods because it only moves 95 pips per day, but I have seen positive results nonetheless.  Keep posting on this thread.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Should not the WRT Daily95 be used on the pairs that trend the most, and the BKSujal range system be used on the pairs that trend the least?

The results you just posted for 9/17/07, when did you do set up these trades, Sunday 5 EST?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
My own stuff... But also matlab, excel, c++ the usual stuff at hand. The data is coming from Metatrader or eventually from other sources (Bloomberg)

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Due to a very busy period I could not post them. I am not ready I will later this week.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Monday (here in Brisbane) is an exception for me ( it may not be for everyone ) because my brokers spreads (Oanda) are still very wide at that time. So I had to wait until around 8pm EST before placing those trades. This will most likely be the norm for me each week. However, those whose brokers do not have wide spreads could place their trades at 5pm EST. That's your call. From memory, on this occasion to do so would've resulted in losses, so I'm grateful to Oanda for this.

I am trading with OANDA too. For the same reason as you do I open trades at 5am GMT.

Hey Bullrock,

What kind of language are you using in Excel for backtesting?  I have access to 15 min. data from the past year+ through FXCM and would like to backtest some of the strategies in this thread.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #411 ---
VBA mostly... Some statistical analysis are in form of Excel add-ins that I have written in C++

--- 帖子 #412 ---
hey bullrock, for someone who is not good at programming, what program would you recommend for backtesting? I would love to back test more but I am not that good at it.

thanks.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Most of the time an excel sheet will do. There are some free tools and very expensive ones. The question is: what do you want to do? You could use Metatrader but I tell you that is rubbish in backtesting. Often the automated backtest I have done showed looser strategy than I have done a manual calculation and it showed winner. I'll find you a list But for example you have Metaquotes, Tradestation, Sierra charts... there is another two. They are top of the range just cannot remember I will PM you later with the details. I have to find the links.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
wow thanks bullrock! i have always heard that the metatrader one was too shaky. I just wanted to be able to test strategies etc like breakouts and crossover systems that use indicators like MA's and stochs.

appreciate it

--- 帖子 #415 ---
For that a simple spreadsheet would do... Put your historical data in one part... based on that your MAs and Stochs.. and then calculate on simple logic your entries and exits... This is done .off you go ... if you want I can send you a template... But this is off topic here... PM me your e-mail.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
the biggest problem i see is placement of stop loss, if they are too big then risk/reward ratio goes bad if small then you get stopped out of win trade. any one have any ideas ?. i was thinking wat if instead of using low of previous day why not use close of previous day to go short if the candle's close is higher and visa versa for long if the close is lower. any one wants to suggestion on stop loss ?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
just as a thought adjusting stop loss greater than take profit require a system to have a 80% or may be more. and stop losses is one of the most confusing. as if u take close price - x(value) for short and high + x(value) for long the system works but at time the both are triggered but to take one must be closed but if the stop loss are too tight then as i said before u might get stopped from a winning trade and if they are large they might keep ur losses run far too long. the only thing i can suggest is 1:1 ratio for stop at the moment, if some one have any better suggestion

good day

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi Bullrock,

Can you help to calculate the retracement impact on the following strategy:

1) Whenever the current day's high exceeds the prior day's high + 5 pips, 94% of the time over the last eight years the current day's high will travel at least an additional 10 pips.

2) The problem is that sometimes when the current day's high exceeds the prior day's high + 5 pips, a retracement will also occur before it corrects and travel the additional 10 pips.

3) My question is this... how many times among the 94% of times that a success was obtained did the pips retrace more than 40 pips or 30 pips before correcting and going back up to a success?

4) This was with the GBPUSD; however, I believe there's a similar pattern with other pairs as well.

5) Going short with this same strategy, the success rate was 85.7%

Just a quick note for newbies to the thread:

As suggested by bullrock, using both the Daily95pip and bksujal strategies will hedge against times when the market is either trending or ranging.

We can see from this weeks results that both are proving profitable, though this may not always be the case. Thus, the hedging approach.

mike

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi, Walt, How can you yield 4 winning trades out of every 5 trades or better, given a pattern with 60%-67% probability? I think it should be 3 winning trades out of 5. Thanks!

[/quote] I've observed that about 60% - 67% of the daily candles have trended in accordance with the prior day close. In other words, if the prior day's candle closed higher than its opening, then the next day's candle will have a 60% - 67% probability for also closing higher than its opening, which was the closing price of the prior day.

Simply taking advantage of this pattern can easily yield four wining trades out of every five trades, or better. Based on standard lot sizes, that's a profit of about $800 - $1,000 for every 5 trades - per day or per week.

I have been testing the following currency pairs: GBPJPY, USDJPY, EURJPY, USDCHF, & GBPUSD.

Please let me know if your backtesting or forward testing supports this assertion...

Thanks,

Walt[/quote]

Hmmm...the totals seem to be different....I don't know where I went wrong with the additions, however I'm sure you get the idea.

Hi Bullrock

your thread is about daytrading, and adjusting s/l ; we are looking here for a put and forget strategy.

The question is if putting a 20 pips t/p and 20 s/l at the close is statisticly a good strategy, or maybe only putting it after 2 consecutive days of high or low?

your input would be a big help,

regards,

Vanupips

Hello,

I've been following this thread with great interest from the beginning, and have even traded live with both systems, unfortunately to my loss. So, today, I spent a great deal of time trying to refine much of the information and ideas already presented here into a system that might work a little better, and with less complication.

It's a bit more conservative, and I've only tested it back for the last three weeks on GBP/USD to the beginning of September, but I'll present it anyway, in the hope that it might spark some greater intelligence, a few enhancements, and possibly increase our collective net worth. If anyone wants to back-test further, or wishes to comment constructively, please feel free to do so. Here are the rules:

SET UP:

1. One day ends while another begins at 2400 GMT. We trade each day at the closing price of the previous day, as recorded at 2400 GMT.  **See time reference after rules.

2. We trade Monday at Friday's closing price. Ignore all weekend price action and  ignore Monday morning gaps.

3. Determine the trend of the previous day, i.e., if the previous day closed higher than it opened, the trend was UP.

4. Determine range (by subtracting daily low from daily high) for previous day.

ENTRY:

1. Enter an order after the close of the 2300 GMT candle, at the closing price. This is the price at 2400 (midnight) GMT. A simple market order should work fine.

2. Enter with the trend. In other words, we buy long if the trend for the previous day was up, short if the trend was down. Only one trade for the evening.

3. Set TP=40, SL=40. For now, there are no secondary targets, as I want to keep things as simple as possible, to see if our entries work well enough to continue further discussion. For the record, in my tests many pips were left on the table after our initial target was hit.

FILTERS - DO NOT IGNORE:

1. If previous day's range was less than 100, DO NOT TRADE!

2. If the previous day's open and close were within 5 or 6 pips of each other, use the trend from the day before.

END OF RULES

----------------

Results for last three weeks:

9/3-9/7:      +160 pips

9/10-9/14:   + 80

9/17-9/21:   + 80

-----------

Total           +320 pips

**Time reference: 2400 GMT is the same as 8 PM (2000 hrs) EDT. When the U.S. returns to EST, this will become 7 PM (1900 hrs) EST. GMT does not change.

Disclaimer: I am only a novice trader, and could be way off here, so please exercise your own judgment before entering any trade based on this, or anyone else's system.

EDIT: I just tried this on EURJPY for the same period and it failed terribly.

Good luck to all!

Hi,

I suggested this method in post 395, (with 20 T/p and s/L,and without your filters), and I hope Bullrock will help with some more extensive backtesting.

Your filters make sens but do they really made a difference in your trading?

If you can check the results with 20 pips instead of 40 , it would be nice.

maybe the eur/jpy would be profitable.

Regards,

Vanupips

I am going to do some excel based analysis later on next week.. I am real busy now unfortunately. But will do, will do.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
See?? Maybe it did help a bit to achieve those results?? Yes?? No?? Maybe?? I have no idea but at least it seems. Set and forget yes. But IMHO there is nothing wrong to set an alert or something (e-mail, sms, whatever) to send you a note that TP has been hit so move the SL to BE. Believe me that helps.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Yes bullrock, your suggestion was definitely a good one and I apologise for not validating it earlier. I was purposely delaying actively adjusting stops as I wanted to first test this strategy as a set and forget system. Obviously, if one has the time to sit and monitor the trades all day or is on hand after being alerted and makes the right decisions, better results will come. Adjusting the stops to breakeven after the first or second profit target has been reached can (though not always ) be evidence of this.

Thanks again for your input.

Hi Mike,

I think you're doing a spectacular job here, very diligent, extremely thoughtful. But I'm not sure I am up to date with your exact current method, as it has evolved somewhat since you first introduced it to us.

Would you please be so kind as to post your current trading rules?

Very much appreciated, thanks!

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Thanks Jeff.

The rules are the same as in post #1. I've tried to remember to update it as new ideas or alterations have been introduced.

The only difference with my approach now is that of actively adjusting stops as profit targets are reached. I've added this as an option in post#1 for those able to monitor or manage their trades instead of using the set and forget approach.

So this opens up a whole lot of options...one may choose to raise stops to breakeven after the first PT is reached, or wait until the 2nd PT is reached before setting the 3rd order's stop at BE.... that's your call.

Though it means not being able to walk away and forget the trades for the day (unless you can trade from a pocket PC ), it will certainly prove more profitable and will definitely help to keep losses to a minimum. So I'm posting results accordingly to show what IS possible with this system.

rgs

mike

PS. I'm also demo trading the "ranging" strategy introduced by bksujal. It is a system in progress and the results are included with Daily95pips result updates.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
thanks to you guys for your work. This thread has been looking interesting and a lot of good feedback been coming through.

Mikelath, I was just curious about something. how do you know when to adjust the SL to BE? Do you watch the market or do you have it set to alert you when a TP has been hit? The scary part for me is that once the first TP has been hit, essentially you are halving your SL from 30 pips to 15. Would that then increase the prob. of the stop getting hit in such a tight range?

take care.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi vder.

Adjusting SL to BE is entirely up to your discretion.

Just to put the matter in perspective, I am only paper trading this system. Sometimes I won't even place a demo trade. I will simply calculate the entry levels and look back over the days price movement and see how the trades would have developed.

Based on this, it's easy for me to view the trades from a 'what if ' perspective. In a live scenario one would need to be much more diligent in monitoring the trades to be ready to adjust the SL to BE when the first or second PT have been reached. If alerts are helpful to do this then that's great.

This thread is merely to show what IS possible to achieve with this system.

The reality in a live situation will certainly be more challenging.

Yes, you are correct in that if SL are adjusted to breakeven the stop will then be only 15pips. Again, this approach opens up a lot more options. Remember that at this point we will have locked in +15pips of profit and will be eradicating any chance of a loss while leaving open a chance for another +80pips of profit. Alternatively, we could wait until the 2nd PT is reached before adjusting the SL to BE. Doing so would also leave open greater downside risk. So at the end of the day it's whatever you're comfortable with.

I hope this answers your question.

Hi prennie.

Daily95pips - post#1. Any alterations/additions are included there.

If your interested in the 'ranging' approach start reading from post#138 any post made by bksujal.

I use Oanda trading platform for this strategy.

Regarding S/R , there are NO indicators used or needed with the Daily95pips strategy because it simply relies on a breakout from the previous days high or low using pending orders. IMHO to add indicators would unnecessarily overcomplicate this system.

I hope this helps.

I suggest you contact your brokers support staff as this issue varies from one broker to another. Some brokers have a live help facility which is very useful in understanding their trading platform.

hey mike, thanks for the reply. you hit the nail right on the head. thanks again.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
hey Mike,

i must commend you for taking some much time to see this strategy to this point. I have been following this thread from the very beginning, and i must say that i have learnt alot from it and all the intelligent contribution from the rest of the guys. Personally i feel that the Daily95pips strategy may not be the perfect put and forget system, but in discussing it to this point, a new and more efficient strategy that requires little monitoring once TP is reached, to adjust SL to BE. This system i think would be a useful for those of us that have more time to monitor trades. And for those without that time, using an alert system (text message or email etc.) would be very handy.

As for the Bksujal system, i think it has proven to be quite unstable to tweak. Perhaps it there need to discuss it more.  What say you?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi ndphoenix.

Thanks for your kind words.

I agree that the bksujal system needs more adjustment. bksujal has given some hints however hasn't followed up with a proper explanation on how he goes about it. So I'm on the verge of letting it go and focusing solely on Daily95pips.

As long as there are multiple profit targets it makes sense to be actively managing the trades.

Thus I agree and have realised on this thread that this is not the perfect set and forget system. If there were only one Long order and one Short order it would be. In fact, I trade such a system with 30PT and 30SL. Very simple, and allows one to focus more on money management techniques to maximise results.

mike

--- 帖子 #447 ---
yes...

would u like tell us, based on market-opening, is it on Sydney time or Tokyo, or London market-opening??

and btw, is anybody can tell me how to use trailing stop in MT4?? and explanation about it?  when i put my TP 50pips from my entry price, and i put 30pips as Trailing stop, so the SL made by trailing stop will be 20pips up my entry or 20 pips below my SL??

thanx before....

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi Betees1.

Regarding timezones the following link may be helpful:

http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html

Essentially, you can place trades whenever you feel like it on whichever days, however following a consistent system / routine may be a better idea.

If 5pmEST is not a suitable time for you to be placing orders then the main thing to consider is having the orders placed before the European session starts. Orders placed before 2am EST should be 'safe' in this regard.

Regarding money management, please read the end of post#1. The total amount risked on any one trade should not exceed 3% of our trading account balance. So, regardless of the size of your account, trading in terms of % is better than thinking in $ terms. Money management is of equal importance to our trading strategy, though I have only touched upon it in this thread.

I have added you to yahoo msgr.

Hi GaPs.

I'm not sure about your first question....5pm EST = 5pm in New York. You may also find use with the following link:
http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html

The way I use the trailing stop in MT4 (though i don't use them with this strategy) is right clicking on an already opened order.

The 'live help' provided by most brokers is useful in these matters.

Hi Mike,

What are your summarized results for each of the 4 currency pairs used in the Daily95? Just curious if one or more pairs are performing better than others. I have been using a modified method of this strategy using the ATR and 4 positions. I noticed the EUR pairs did poorly this week, but the GBP pairs did really well with my method. Thanks,

Comment: It just gets better and better for EURJPY. Newly at 2nd place is USDJPY.  Though GBPJPY is a big mover and shaker, I believe that it is too volatile and has been stopped out too often for it to be suited to the parameters of this strategy. Greater stop levels would be required.

ps. Just to remind everyone, I slipped up on the grand totals somewhere along the line, however you can still see that the results are very good overall.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hey Mike,

Good system. I had few quick questions.

1. I am curious to see if you can share the consolidated results you had since you started using this strategy?

2. Since this strategy works well on trending days, do you use any filter to stay out of ranging days?

3. If you have 3 day consequtive losses in a row, would you still take the trade for the same future contract the 4th day?

4. I am curious to see if you like the idea of moving stop to breakeven - 15 after the first contract hit entry +15, moving to breakeven when the second contract hit entry + 30 and trail stop after that.

Thank you for the good posts. Have a good day,

Ram

Hi Mike, are you trading this system with real money?

can you share with us some more details and your results?

thanks,

Vanupips

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi Vanupips.

Sure. The system I am currently trading live (with real money) is still based on placing orders 5pips above and below the previous days high and low (as per post#1) though I only place one order each side and only aim for 30pips using 30pip stops. That's it. The risk:reward is 1:1. The money management takes care of the rest

I may decide to start a new thread on this strategy and include my money management approach and results, however I prefer not to do so on this thread which is dedicated to D95P.

I'm impressed by the recent performance of D95P

I was thinking to adapt similiar method just like yours on my live trading

maybe Daily 60 pips......... so i can put the trade and let it run without having to concern to move my SL to BE after the 2nd TP

the idea is like this :

1. Put 2 lot above or below daily H/L with TP 15 and SL 30

2. Put 1 lot above or below daily H/L with TP 30 and SL 30

this way you can get 60 pips........

but the risk/reward is not 1:1

so I'm a little bit concern on this

can u give some suggestion mikelath

thx anyway

HEY MIKELATH ARE THESE LIVE TRADE RESULTS OR PAPER TRADES

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi andimozza.

If you'd like to experiment with your own version of the D95P strategy by all means do so. You may like to forward/backtest for results to ascertain if it is feasible.

It has been realised on this thread that to maximise results with D95P one would need to be more actively involved in monitoring trades and adjusting SL levels as profit targets are reached.

If you are wanting a simple set and forget strategy I recommend www.daily20pip.com

I've found (and the results show) that the higher profit target on the 3rd order of the D95P strategy, though not always achieved, more than compensates when it is.

I've also been careful to keep the risk:reward at approx. 1:1...in fact it's a bit better...there is the psychological advantage of knowing that even if one pair is stopped out at -90pips and another achieves +95pips I'll be up +5pips instead of breakeven. This gives the feeling of constant progress.

I NOTICE YOU ONLY HAVE 5 CURRENCY PAIRS INSTEAD OF 6 CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW MANY PAIRS DO YOU BUY LONG AND HOW MANY PAIRS DO YOU GO SHORT ON AND WHICH PAIRS DO YOU USE SHORT WHICH ONES DO YOU USE TO GO LONG

Mike, wasn't the GBPUSD a -90 pip loss on 10/1/07? Take a look at the attached chart, a buy stop was triggered and then it was stopped out.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I don't know wether this question is being ask before.......

but have you try to replace GBP/JPY with USD/CHF ???

and thx for your reply mikelath........

I'll try to do some trade on demo acct 1st and see where it goes  after a month or so

Prennie,

As the thread progresses I am shortlisting the best performing pairs ( by removing the least performing pairs ). So far I've removed EURGBP from the list. The objective is to have a list of 2-3 pairs to focus on.

sslack88,

Good observation. In Oanda (which is the broker I use for this strategy) the orders were not triggered, however in North Finance (MT4) they were.

This is another example of how results can vary from one broker to another.

rgs,

andimozza,

When I removed EURGBP from the list I considered adding USDCHF. This pair is a very accurate opposite correlative pair to EURUSD. This is part of the reason I haven't added it to the list. The other reason is that I'm trying to make a shortlist of the 2 or 3 best performing pairs to focus on. EURUSD is currently 3rd on the race...so I'd expect the results of USDCHF to be similar, so therefore I don't consider it necessary for it to be included.

Having said that you are most welcome to trade it too.

mike

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Mike,

I got a quick question on this method. Since we are continuously observing the trade. Do we cancel the opposite order once an order has been triggered?

Example, 2nd Oct.

GBPUSD Short Triggered but got stopped out.

Should I cancel the Long Order for GBPUSD?

EURUSD Short Triggered, TP1 hit and still on going.

Should I cancel the Short Order for EURUSD?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi gyfu.

When I was setting and forgetting the orders I would leave both orders open to be triggered, and sometimes they both would.

Now, because of being more actively involved with the trades I have been cancelling the short orders once the long orders have triggered and visa versa.

mike

--- 帖子 #477 ---
oh btw mikelath,

you've said that you live trade this similiar methode but only using 30pips TP and SL

may i know what pair did you trade live with the 30 pips TP and SL ??

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I am sorry for this kind of question, but could someone tell me please what is GMT equivalent for 17:00 PST. Also, could someone please tell me what time Oanda is using ? thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I played a bit with 95pips strategy and backtested it. I guess I'm doing something wrong because I loose and performance is not even close to one published here.

How do you set buy at last day high+5pips?

This should always be higher or equal current ASK price.

Do you mean that you buy it only if price reaches last day high?

So if eurusd last day high would be 1.3995, you would buy if price reaches 1.4000?

Hi mihat.

I suggest that you carefully read post#1.

We are placing PENDING orders at 5pips above AND below the previous days high and low (to be more precise, the previous 17hrs from 5pm EST ).

You are correct with your EURUSD example calculations, though remember that the pending orders have been placed before price reaches this level.

For example, today's orders for GBPUSD are Long: 2.0499 and Short: 2.0369. The previous high and low were therefore 2.0494 and 2.0374 respectively. So, pending orders have already been placed and we simply wait to see which of the long or short orders are triggered first.

We therefore DO NOT wait until price reaches these levels and then use MARKET orders.

I hope this answers your questions.

Mike pls sorry for asking silly question, my problem here is how to derive the high and low figure. please can you give me a snap short on how to do that from the candles.

thanks

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hey! Thanks for your answer. However I am still confused. My software (interbank fx4) does not allow to place pending order for buy higher than current asking price or lower for sell.

My program for this strategy is as follows:
Inserted Code
int h = TimeHour(TimeCurrent())+hourDiff;

if(h==3)
{
lowLast = CheckForLastLow()-5*Point;
highLast = CheckForLastHigh()+5*Point;
}

if((Ask == highLast) && orderToday == false)
{
OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, Lots, Ask,3,highLast-stopLoss*Point,Ask+tP1*Point,"",0,1200, Green);
OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, Lots, Ask,3,highLast-stopLoss*Point,Ask+tP2*Point,"",2,1200, Green);
OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, Lots, Ask,3,highLast-stopLoss*Point,Ask+tP3*Point,"",4,1200, Green);
orderToday = true;

}
if((Bid == lowLast) && orderTodayS == false)
{
OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_SELL, Lots, Bid,3,Ask+stopLoss,Ask-tP1,"",1,1200, Red);
OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_SELL, Lots, Bid,3,Ask+stopLoss,Ask-tP2,"",3,1200, Red);
OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_SELL, Lots, Bid,3,Ask+stopLoss,Ask-tP3,"",5,1200, Red);
orderTodayS = true;
}

/*close orders*/
if(orderToday == true && h == -2)
{
for(int i=0;i<OrdersTotal();i++)
{
if(OrderSelect(i,SELECT_BY_POS,MODE_TRADES)==false)break;
if(OrderType()==OP_BUY){
OrderClose(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),Bid,3,White);
}else{
OrderClose(OrderTicket(),OrderLots(),Ask,3,White);
}
}
orderToday = false;
orderTodayS = false;
}

But there must be some huge error in a logic, because I get negative returns.

Hi Mikelath

Like the thread, interesting concept - that seems to be working.

First hows the sunshine coast, moving from the uk soon the the sunshine coats.

I understand you keep the 1st post uptodate, but also note you are trading a different system also, are there any adjustment i should be aware of from post one and could you also add your other system to a post in complete form, not Bksujal's.

regards

MPP

--- 帖子 #487 ---
You would need to use a BUY STOP and SELL STOP.  The above code, I believe, will enter the order immediately since you are entering prices above and below the current price, so it takes the current price.

A possible sample script is:

http://codebase.mql4.com/en/1024

EDIT:  Actually, after looking at this above script (TrendMeLeaveMe), this should already be setup to work for Daily95Pips.  You can draw a horizontal trendline on the high and low of the past 17 hours, set the Upper/Lower settings to your 5 pips, and it will automatically generate the buystop/sellstop orders for you (only when it enters into the zone).  The profit targets and whatnot may need to be added.

Hi MPP.

Coming from the UK to the Sunshine Coast you will feel like you've arrived in Heaven !  The beaches are great, the people are relaxed, there's an abundance of everything, and of course the climate is sub-tropical.

Firstly regarding bksujal's system, I'll be discontinuing it as of next week and will focus solely on D95P.

D95P has not changed...it's all there in post#1. The only thing I'm doing differently is adjusting stop levels to breakeven when profit targets are reached ( this is also mentioned in post#1 ).

Remember to call me when you arrive in Oz.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Om.

I'm not sure how to add charts to a post...if you can advise me how that would be helpful.

Regarding deriving the high and low...it really depends on which broker you use and how the time is setup...

I use Oanda...so at 5pm EST I use one of two methods....either I'll open a daily chart, place the cursor on the last candle and take the high and low from the data box that pops up....or for Monday's orders I'll open a 1hr chart and look for the high and low going back to 00:00 midnight on the previous Friday morning.

The main consideration is that whatever you're approach for deriving the high and low (even if it is different to others) ,  be consistent.

Mikelath Sir,

Just found your thread couple days ago & started only yesterday. I got +159 pips for today. Wow, It works! I've followed the instructions carefully & used Oanda thou I did'nt came up with the same result of 258 pips. Well, I did let it run the day & did'nt bother to check it out.

I'm impressed, thank you so much & keep up the good work.

2 options for posting charts

with MT4 not sure about other, right click over chart and there is a save picture/chart option, save to to your desktop

other way is to use the print screen button on you keyboard, push button, open PAINT (found under accessories in windows start), edit, paste, file , save as, j-peg or BMP, desktop.

once this is done

click the paperclip icon on the reply to thread/post and a new box opens, browes, desktop, selectfile, upload,

once uploaded, click paperclip and click on file.  Done.

hope this helps

MPP

PS if you right click on the file you save to desktop, you can open with picture editor if you have it and crop the image to the size you need (cut out the bites you don't want shown)  also in paint colour over the items like account numbers.

Hello mikelath,

This thread has been very informative. I thought that I would put your system to the test so I started live trading last night. As you know, live trading is a whole different ballgame.

I will try to update the forum as much as I can. It would be interesting to see if you end up with the same results that I do.

Thanks to johnedoe and MPP for the tips on adding chart images.

I've been able to save a chart from MT4, however not from Oanda. I don't know why. Even the help staff couldn't figure it out. I followed the standard procedure of clicking on the chart, printscreen, then pasting to either MS Paint or a Word doc , though nothing happens. I'm pretty sure it must be something to do with the copying part (prnt scrn) because after attempting to copy the image, if I go into Paint - Edit, paste is not highlighted as an option.

Anyway, life goes on.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Hey Damon.

Results DO vary. On the 3rd Oct I got +45pips on GBPJPY which means that the first 2 profit targets were reached before retracing and stopping out.

I can understand your -90pips result if you didn't adjust the stops after the first PT was reached.

Slight variations in price between brokers can be another contributing factor.

Your absolutely right. Live trading is definitely a whole different ballgame. Getting very confident with this strategy first (by testing over 2-3 months) will hopefully make the step into live trading easier to handle.

Mike,

I had a problem using PrtScn in the past.  It turned out that it was due to my (wireless Microsoft) keyboard settings.  In order to access the PrtScn function, I had to press a key called FLock (may vary depending on brand of keyboard).  This turned FLock OFF, and then when I pressed Ctrl-PrtScn the current window was properly copied to the windows clipboard for pasting into other applications such as word and paint.  I thought I would offer this in case you were using a similar keyboard that locks the function keys by default to some other meaning like mine was.

Regards,

Greg

Hello Mike,

I do set a trailing stop at 15 pips for all my orders at the time I place the orders. My buy stop order for Oct. 3rd was 237.88 and it went immediately down. On Oct. 3rd, what was your price at entry so I can compare to where I entered?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Thanks Mike, one more question.

When a order is filled do you cancel the opposite one?

Wow...my entry for GBPJPY on that day was 236.83. That's 105pips difference! Hmmm...price does vary , though I wouldn't expect it to that much. I could've made an error arriving at that entry level, however based on that I got +45pips for the day. Onward sweet chariots !

Hi Mike!

I wanted to thank you for all you do to help us all to be better traders!

Straddle trading suits me best with basically a set and forget strategy (or I can meddle with it occasionally when I feel disposed to lose money)!  LOL

Please give me your candid opinion regarding the following:

1) I have reduced the buy/sell entry points from 50 to 21 pips above/below the current price when placing pending orders. Why? 21 pips seem to soak up most of the whiplashes, yet gives me a greater opportunity to have my Take Profit levels filled.

2) My entry price is now set @ 2AM CDT (GMT 700). Why? Because I am wanting to avoid the Asian market price wandering without generally having a trade work successfully (GBP/USD) in that market. I am also avoiding the Frankfurt Market opening that generally has a stop hunting scheme activated. I am attempting to hit the first big movement in the world's largest market in London when it opens. The last reason is that I don't place much stock in yesterday's price movement affecting today's movement. So....the current price @ 2AM is the most salient time/price relevancy with which to place a trade.

3) Have you considered placing your D95P orders at different times of the day to coincide with the particular "hot" markets that apply to the individual currency pairs you are trading (similar to my GBP/USD example, above)?

Thanks in advance for your critique and commentary.

Best regards,

Bobkat in Wisconsin

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Okay...I would like for us to get on the same page.  I set my two vertical lines on Oct 4th at 400 GMT and 2100 GMT. Unless I am wrong, this equates to 12:00 AM and 5:00 PM EST. I believe following your thread that these are also the times you said you equated to as well.

The GBPJPY high for that day was 237.83 and the low was 236.07. My buy stop was hit at 237.88 and went striaght down for the loss.

Can you please tell me why your numbers differed from mine on that day?

Oh wait, I just realized that you were talking about Oct. 3rd and I was talking about Oct. 4th. What did you get for the GBPJPY on Oct. 4th?

October 5th live results:

EURJPY   +16

USDJPY   +76

GBPJPY   +60

EURUSD   -45

GBPUSD   Still open at this time (currently -10 each trade)

UERUSD   Also went the other way and is still open at this time (currently -10 each trade)

How do your numbers add up for Oct. 5th. Are they the same as mine or close?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi all;

I like the concept (just read the entire thread) and would like to help... and get help ...

1) To all participants in panic about NOT getting same results as mikelath...  YOU WILL NOT GET SAME RESULTS... Don't worry so much about that. It's the CONCEPT that is important. I've demo-ed numerous systems on 6 different demo accounts and 2 live accounts at the same time and NOT ONCE have I gotten identical results (unless brokers had identical feeds). Different feeds give different results. But... hopefully... the METHOD will work.

2) MIKELATH... Really appreciate your dedication  . I think the attached EA will help you A LOT. You set each order ONCE and it will take profits at specified levels and move your stops along the way. You can set (1) EA to EACH PAIR's chart and let it work. No need to watch it. (NOTE: It will only manage ONE trade PER PAIR at a time. There is a way to attach to multiple trades for the same pair and manage them individually, but it requires a script and a Magic Number. We can get more advanced later... if you wish) - (Open the EA in MetaEditor and you can read the instructions I've written for each setting).

3) I've spent months learning to code EAs so I can back-test, only to realize that MT4 back-testing is... well... worthless (unless doing some crude analysis). So now... I really want to learn more about using Excel to do analysis. I believe it's much  more reliable / accurate (I know the program well, but never used it to back-test). So... Can everyone please beg BULLROCK to come back and give a sample of how to use Excel to back-test .

Specific example: How to test - once price reaches previous day high, how often it breaks by 5 pips, by 10 pips, etc... AND - if it hits previous day high, then retraces, before breaking back up - how far, on average, does it retrace, before heading back up.

This has promise... I hope I can help... AND GET RICH

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I sent BR a PM, it would be interesting to learn how to backest in excell, so i hope he takes the challange.

MPP

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Thanks, MPP;

Bullrock... comebaaaaaack!!! I have the historical data in Excel, just don't know where to start. Probably requires "if-then" statements which I need help with.

Then we can post back-test results with various settings and have many people forward test it.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hello pipimo88,

Thanks for the EA. Unfortunately I can't use it without a magic number as I use a few other ones as well and without the magic number they will interfere with each other.

I tried to PM you, but I guess I do not have that ability with this forum. I have a trading method that I like which I have taken from others and modified to fit my comfort level and trading tolerances. I really am looking for someone who could put this into an EA for me. I am willing to pay for a good job or perhaps you might like it so much you will use it yourself and not want to charge me .

Anyway, sorry to post this in public, but if you are interested I would love to talk.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
damonl... I sent PM.

I have the script for order placement with Magic No for multiple orders on same pair... however, I didn't want to turn MIKELATH thread into an EA/script support. I just thought it might help MIKELATH manage his test-trades and not have to place 6 orders on 6 pairs, since we are all benefiting from his findings.

If MIKELATH finds it useful and would like to incorporate it into this thread, I'll be happy to do my part.

I really would like to see this method develop and fine-tune, as it has merit / potential / ease of use (IMHO).

--- 帖子 #514 ---

I replied to your PM....did you recieve it?

So here it is.

1. It might contain errors. I have pulled it together in 20 minutes. (NUTS!)

2. This is based on the daily data.. So the SL might have triggered before the TP. I did not take into account this. Fo that I would need 5min or hourly data and would take more time to code.

3. Just longs. (I was lazy)

Hi Bobkat.

Hey, I dream of visiting Wisconsin and the possibility of bumping into Heather Graham there !

Now back to reality....in response to the above points:

1. My understanding here is that you place straddles 21pips above and below the current price. Yeah, good idea. If this approach outperforms D95P let us know, then I'm with you.

2&3. Yes, I've considered placing the orders closer to London open, however there are times when price breaks out during the Asian session as well (not very often though) and if it doesn't then I know I've already placed the trades ready for the European / London sessions.

Having said that, there are also times when during the Asian session price will trigger the orders and then 'dribble' back down to stopout. This can happen just as easily during the European session when there is more volatility.

So considering all the above and the fact that it suits me to place the trades first thing in the morning here in Brisbane, I've just kept the entry time as is.

Heather Graham is HOT HOT HOT !

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi pipimo88.

On the contrary, you're offering the EA has come at just the right time!

I'm now hoping to use an EA for this strategy. I'll try the EA you've included a few posts back, however if you are happy to help us with a more complete EA that would be great.

What I really need is an EA with all the criteria in post#1 including all 6 orders per pair, a OCO function to cancel the short orders once the long orders have triggered, and visa versa. Also needed are the stops being adjusted to breakeven on the 2 remaining orders after the first profit target has been achieved. I guess automatic entry and exit goes without saying...and ideally a money management function / lot sizing of risking no more than 3% of trading account on any one trade (ie. total of 3 orders=90pips).

I probably should have put the above in point form...anyway, if you're able to achieve the above you have my vote.

Hey pipimo88.

Just a quick addition...if placing ONE order with 3 profit targets achieves the same result and is easier to program then there may be no need for 3 separate orders. The inclusion of moving stops along the way is also good.

Thanks again. You're contribution is invaluable.

Hi all.

See post #499 for updated results of the past week , weekly and individual pairs.

Just to be clear... Mike (MIKELATH);

Regarding OCO... There has been talk of straddling the HIGH or LOW... i.e. Break of yesterday's HIGH+5=LONG and bounce off the HIGH of 10%=SHORT. Basically... Creating a tunnel off the HIGH (LOW), which BULLROCK posted and I happen to like

Or... are you talking about if going long on break of HIGH, cancel the "sell" on break of LOW?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hmmm....yes, I was talking about if going long on break of HIGH, cancel the "sell" on break of LOW. IMHO D95P is profitable enough, so I believe incorporating the 'ranging' strategy of bksujal is not necessary, in fact it may be counter-productive in cancelling out profits already achieved by D95P.

If you're able to create an EA for the D95P criteria  I'd be grateful.

Having said that, I believe that if the bksujal's 'ranging' strategy is pursued it would also require multiple profit targets. Based on the ATR idea of determining different SL and TP for each pair according to volatility / range it may be more challenging to devise an EA to suit....though you'd know more about this than I.

Whatever you can do is good.

Mike... Just read post #499

May I offer a suggestion before deciding to scrap any pair? (ok... that's a rhetorical question, because after asking, I'm gonna offer the suggestion .

After designing several strategies and fine-tuning to be "profitable" NOW... I back-tested, pip-by-pip for 2005 and 2006 and found that some didn't work at all and others better/worse on certain months.

This is where we need BULLROCK (come baaaaaack, bullrock ) to do analysis of long-term, then forward-test the best outcome and let the system prove itself. We might find that certain pairs stall at certain times, for what ever reason and perform really well at other times.

I'll provide scripts / EAs to make it easier for you/others to keep testing more pairs over longer term. Should have something for you to work with by Sun.

Just my 2... um... pips

I need to correct the information above concerning the behavior of PrtScn:

Ctrl-PrtScn - captures the current screen (the entire desktop)

Alt-PrtScn - captures the current window (the active window)

Sorry for the confusion.

Since we are still testing and there might be changes / improvements, I wanted to keep this simple. The more complicated the EA and the more variables it has, the more confusing things get. Once the system is set, it’s easy to automate it. So here’s what I’ve come up with, so far.

NOTE: Here it comes… EAs and Scripts here work on MetaTrader (MT4)… I don’t know about other platforms. Make sure you test it all on demo accounts first. I, anyone I know, anyone I have ever known, anyone I will ever know and anyone that I still don’t know and will get to know and those that they don’t know yet but may know or have ever known…is NOT responsible…blah, blah, blah… Anyway, obviously… Use these at your own risk.

If you want info on “Experts” (EA), how to attach, setup, etc…  and “Magic Number” info, please search the web. It’s all out there.

Step 1) Place “Stop Order Magic” into ~/yourBroker/MetaTrader 4/experts/scripts/  - folder

Step 2) Place “Trade Manager EA” into ~/yourBroker/experts/ - folder

Step 3) Open MT4 (close then re-open, if open now) and both files should appear in your “Navigation” window.

NOTE: To read instructions on “Trade Manager EA” settings, right-click it then “modify” – Opens MetaEditor and you’ll see instructions.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
1)Open 2 chart windows for the same pair.

2)On 1st chart drag “Stop_Order” script and enter inputs for “buystop”

3)Drag “Trade_Manager” to the chart and enter how you want this trade managed and be sure to enter the same Magic No. as assigned in step 2.

4)On 2nd chart drag “Stop_Order” script and enter inputs for “sellstop”

5)Drag “Trade_Manager” to the chart and enter how you want this trade managed and be sure to enter the same Magic No. as assigned in step 4.

NOTE: You can test many different scenarios on the same pair at the same time. Just open another chart window for the pair, use the script to enter the order and assign new Magic No and attach the EA to that chart, using the assigned Magic No.

There is your set-and-forget method. Set the orders and the EA and you’re done for the day. It will take your profits and move the stops along the way.

YOUR COMPUTER MUST BE ON AND TERMINAL OPEN FOR THE EA TO WORK.

-On “Tools > Options > Expert Advisors” tab…

-Make use “Enable Expert advisors” and “Allow Live Trading” is CHECKED and the 2 “Disable experts…” boxes are UN-CHECKED”

-Once attached, make sure you have the smiley face on top-right corner.

Hi to all.

I'am italian.. sorry for my little english, and eventual errors in the language

what of thoughts of these levels?

MAX + 5PIPS = LONG PROFIT 20PIPS , STOP 20PIPS

MAX + 5PIPS = LONG PROFIT 30PIPS , STOP 20PIPS

MAX + 5PIPS = LONG PROFIT 30PIPS , STOP 20PIPS

MAX + 5PIPS = LONG PROFIT 60PIPS , STOP 20PIPS

-------------------------------------------

MIN - 5PIPS = SHORT PROFIT 20PIPS , STOP 20PIPS

MIN - 5PIPS = SHORT PROFIT 30PIPS , STOP 20PIPS

MIN - 5PIPS = SHORT PROFIT 30PIPS , STOP 20PIPS

MIN - 5PIPS = SHORT PROFIT 60PIPS , STOP 20PIPS

--- 帖子 #533 ---
For those sending PMs with questions regarding the EA and Script... I think it might be more beneficial if you asked them here, in the forum, as it may help those who might have the same questions but are afraid to ask .

No... You do not have to use the "Order_Script" if you aren't placing multiple orders on the same currency. You simply enter your order as usual, (market/stop/limit) then attach the EA and let it take profits and move stops for that trade... However, if you don't use the "Order_Script" and assign a Magic No. and later change your mind, your new order will be taken over by the EA, even if it's on a different chart of that pair. I hope that clears it up.

BTW... When you use the EA... it works off YOUR computer, NOT your broker's server. So your T/P and S/L levels are UNKNOWN to your broker... Just letting you know, in case you have a sneaky suspicion that the broker might be going stop hunting (which, of course, they never do ).

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi pipimo88;

Would please explain what the variables mean, and how the stops, and the Target work, if you could use the same variables used in the EA you have attached, please.

Thanks

Thanks a lot for your thread Mikelath

I have been reading the whole thread from post#1.

Now started "demo-ing" it to see how it goes.

Why not using the system with pairs that swing a lot? Like the USD/CHF, AUD/JPN, USD/NOK...etc?

--- 帖子 #537 ---
pipimo88,

Please excuse my ignorance, however the use of EA's is VERY new to me, so in explaining how to use them please assume that I know NOTHING.:surprised

I have started doing online research of my own, however I think your guidance is required with this particular EA. So your patience in this regard will be greatly appreciated by both myself and other newbies to EA's who are following this thread.

My first questions regarding the EA are based on the following quotes:

NOTE:  1ST YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER... THEN YOU SET THIS EA TO MANAGE THAT ORDER... THIS EA WILL ONLY MANAGE (1) PAIR AT A TIME /

Q. This instruction indicates that the EA does not calculate and enter orders for us, rather that we place the orders manually and then the EA manages the trades when they trigger. Correct ?

Q. Even if the EA is attached to multiple charts of various pairs (as is possible on MT4) it can only manage one trade on one pair at a time ?

Q. If we must manually place the orders first, what do you mean by 'set this EA to manage that order' if the EA is already attached to the chart ?

Ok, this is enough for starters. There's bound to be more questions to come. Many thanks for putting it all together for us.

Here is an excellent link for using MetaTrader: http://www.metatrader.info/node/27

Here is an excellent link on Expert Advisors: http://www.metatrader.info/node/34 (has lessons)

NOTE TO "EXPERTS" READING THIS. I have tried to make this post newbie-friendly and if you can add more newbie-friendliness, please do so

EXPERT ADVISORS 101: If you (1) turn off your computer or (2) lose web connection or (3) have EAs attached to charts in different “profiles” (MetaTrader still has bugs and limitations – it is a free platform),  Expert Advisors will NOT work. (Not only the one provided here but NONE of them).

This is why there is a script for manual order entry (and assigning Magic No) – so you are certain your order is set.. At the same time, it allows you the use the EA separately, to manage different systems simultaneously rather than have an EA that works for this system only.

In short, an Expert Advisor “Order” function only recognizes “buy” and “sell” and is set to place an order for THE PAIR, not for the particular TRADE for that pair. In METATRADER, you can place many orders for the same pair, but and EXPERT ADVISOR must be told WHICH trade on WHICH pair in order for it to recognize them as separate orders. Furthermore, METATRADER will allow you to attach the same EXPERT ADVISOR to the same chart only once. Otherwise, the EA would act EVERY TIME it ran into an order line (buy/sell) regardless of how you meant for it to be used.

This is why you assign a Magic No. It is basically a unique trade ID that you assign to a trade just like your broker assigns a ticket number to every trade. But the EA doesn’t recognize the ticket number, because ticket number is located in your broker’s server and the EA resides in your computer.

It tells the EA this: “I have 4 different scenarios going on in GBP/JPY pair. One is buying on break of high, the other is selling on break of low, and I want them all managed in a different way, to see which strategy works better. With assigned Magic No (script), I want you to use  an EA for this trade only and ignore all other buy/sell commands you run into along the way on this pair”.

EXAMPLE: Let’s say you want to test GBP/JPY  break of previous day high and low and you want to test 2 scenarios (using 1 lot as example) all on the same pair (GBP/JPY):

“script” = “Stop_Order_Magic” (provided earlier)

“EA” = “Trade_Manager_EA” (provided earlier)

You need:

(a)4 chart windows for GBP/JPY – any time frame.

(b)Window 1: Use script to place “buystop” – assigning Magic No 11111 - then attach EA to mange it – using Magic No. 11111 (i.e. close entire position at +30 with stop at -30)

(c)Window 2: Use script to place “sellstop” – assigning Magic No 22222 - then attach EA to mange it – using Magic No. 22222 (i.e. close entire position at +30 with stop at -30)

(d)Window 3: Use script to place “buystop” assigning Magic No 33333 - then attach EA to mange it – using Magic No. 33333  (i.e. close .2 lots at +20, close .2 lots at +40, close .2 lots at +60, close .2 lots at +80, close .2 lots at +100, with initial stop at -30, move stop to break-even at +30, move stop to +20 at +50, etc…)

(e)Window 4: Use script to place “sellstop” assigning Magic No 44444 - then attach EA to mange it – using Magic No. 44444 (i.e. same as in “d”)

(f)Then you may have a MA cross system you’re testing

(g)Then test a box breakout on 0:00 GMT

(h)Then test a box breakout on London Open

… and so on. All tested on SAME pair, but requiring its own window and a separate Magic No. (I have a little code system taped to monitor with Magic No utilizing date and a combo of numbers and then just keep recycling the same numbers the next day – OR – you can just add a LABEL to chart window to see which number you assigned).

You can manage as many different trades as you want on the SAME pair on as many pairs as you like. Without Magic No though, an EA will view EVERYTING in steps (b) – (h) above as ONE order and keep acting EVERY TIME it runs into one of those settings.

CAUTION: If you assign the wrong Magic No. or make a mistake when entering it into the EA, the smiley face on top right WILL still appear and FALSELY make you think your trade is beeing managed. Make sure you enter it correctly.

ONCE THE STRATEGY WE’RE TESTING HERE IS WELL TESTED and the “what-ifs” are reduced… then we can design an EA that will (a) calculate the entry (b) assign Magic No (c) Manage the trade (d) Cancel other open orders (e) Take profits and move stops all by just attaching it once at the start of the day. However.. that requires a lot of time and a LOT of testing and working out the bugs before it can be trusted on its own and I'd rather be trading than troubleshooting EAs. So, let’s fine-tune this strategy first, then work on making the mechanics of the trade easy.

Phiewwww…. I’m wiped, It’s a good thing it’s Columbus day and market is slow.

Where did you get historical data? Is it accurate?

You can analyse it with macros. Or with any other programming language. I would insert it from excel to mysql database and analyse it with php - as I work daily with it.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Here's the link for downloading history data: http://www.alpari-idc.com/en/dc/databank.html

The "1M" data can then be converted to standard periodicity by using the "period converter" script.

On one demo account, though, I got really good conversion, up to 98% accuracy (usually it's around 90% with good data) on EA back-tests and on another, I got 24% accuracy with the same EA and same period converter.

So we need to make sure data is verified before testing with it.

A few days ago mike asked me to write EA for Daily95pips strategy.

I can see that pipimo88 has also prepared some other EA, but as I don't like having my projects unfinished, I present here the first version of my EA.

Is is totally automated system. Just add it to your H1 chart, enter parameters and let it work.

Do not use it on your live account now! It's the first release and quite a few bugs may come out.

To make it work you can either:Download mq4 file, copy it to 'experts' folder (located in your MetaTrader platform directory) and compile it. or Download ex4 file, copy it to 'experts' folder. Than restart MetaTrader if necessary and you can find the EA in Strategies node ready to use.

Parameters:FixedLots - amount of lots used for each order. If this is set to 0.0, Risk value will be used. Risk - per cent of capital used for each order. For 0.01 value each order will use the amount of lots equal to 1% of your free margin, i.e. for the total of 3 orders it will take 3% of your balance. Margin - number of pips added to /substracted from day high/low. By default it is set to 5. StopLoss - initial stop-loss value. TakeProfit1, TakeProfit2, TakeProfit3 - take profit values. DayStartHour - hour in your time zone that starts the forex day. LookBackHours - numbers of hours that EA looks back determining day high/low. OrderExpirationHours - number of hours after which buy/sell stop hours will expire. CloseOrdersNextDay - set to true, if you want to close open orders at the end of the day. EA with default settings works according to the rules stated int post #1.

Additionally:When buy orders are triggered, sell stop orders are deleted. And vice versa. (One-cancels-other function). Stop loss is moved to break-even point after reaching first take-profit. That would be it.

Waiting for your remarks.

Cheers,

Pr1mer

To all that have been contributing Great work Thanks

Pr1mer could you please add a Force start option to the EA so it can start as soon as its applied to a chart. In case of a crash or other reason.

Also an option to change "When buy orders are triggered, sell stop orders are deleted. And vice versa" to true or false.

Thanks

Hi Pr1mer.

A job well done !

I'm currently using the ex4 file on a demo account with ODL.

As could be expected, I have a few questions regarding the EA:

Is is totally automated system. Just add it to your H1 chart, enter parameters and let it work.

EA with default settings works according to the rules stated int post #1.

Q. If I don't enter parameters will the EA automatically use the default parameters?

I've added the EA to 1H charts of EURUSD, USDCHF, USDJPY, GBPUSD and EURJPY. However, even though the smiley face is showing at the top right of the chart, the entry, limit and stop levels are only showing on the USDCHF and GBPUSD charts and not the others. I've attached the pics of the GBPUSD and EURJPY charts to this post to show the difference.(It's the first time I've attached charts so I hope this works....)

What could be the possible reason for this ?

Does this mean the orders will only trigger on the GBPUSD and USDCHF pairs and not the others ?

What can I do to rectify ?

mike

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Ok, while the EA is being tested and tweaked I'll continue to post my manually tested results. Even though I'm only going to include 3 pairs here I will continue testing 5-6 pairs with the EA.

I have been through the entire thread few times but couldn't find the reason for choosing + 5 to the highest and - 5 to the lowest prices of previous day.

Any specific reasons?

Would I not get faster entry price if I was setting up same price as previous day?

Or is it specific for an up-trend chart?

Would a -5 high and +5 low apply for a down-trend ?

Hope this question make sense (anyway, it will help me somehow)

Hello pipimo88,

Can I use your trademanager_ea to manage orders that are not triggered using the stop_order_magic? I like that the orders are saved on my computer and not on the platofrom itself. This is an invaluable feature.

For example if I opened a manual sell order for the GBPUSD at 2.0331 and I want to set my s/l for 100 pips and my t/p for 200 pips with some sort of t/s allong the way, can I use your trademanager_ea to manage this trade?

I did try to put it on the chart and I got the smiling man, but some of the settings I was unsure about and also it said that it was managing trade with magic number 11111 and of course there was no trade with this magic number since I manually made the entry.

What are your thoughts and thanks for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
The EA will manage a MAGIC NUMBER... not an "order". You place an order and assign a Magic No. to it for the specific purpose of having THAT order managed by THAT Magic No. If you just place an order straight from MetaTrader, the EA won't know what to manage.

Use the "order_script" to enter that order and assign a Magic No. just so it's assigned. Just put a label in the corner so you know what No. you assigned. You don't HAVE to use the EA. But if you need to walk away in a hurry, you can just set it later because Magic No is already assigned.

If you want to have a "hard" S/L and T/P set along with your order, then use the script to place the initial order and assign Magic No. Then in your terminal, open the placed order to "modify" it and set the hard S/L and T/P. If later you use the EA to manage it, your EA settings or hard T/P will trigger, whichever is hit first.

THIS IS ACTUALLY A GOOD PRACTICE, when using EAs, as a safety measure to have the S/L and T/P placed directly with broker. That way if you lose power in the middle of night and EA stops managing, you still have a safety net.[/quote]

If you use the EA and assign Magic No 11111, then finish that trade, right-click the "smiley" > properties > remove... to remove that EA and start a new one next time you place an order. The EA remains attached and remembers the OLD Magic No. until you REMOVE it (you must have used 11111 before and didn't remove the EA from the chart for the new order)... don't just change properties and enter a new Magic No. for the old EA. Attach a new EA to the new order.

This is why I provided an "order" script separate from the trade manager (EA). So people actually learn how this stuff works.

Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Sorry guys I won't be replying your questions instantly, but my internet access is limited for now. Additionally I'll only have time to work on this EA in the evenings (GMT time zone  ).

Feel free to ask questions here and sugest improvements. I'll try to fix/implement them as soon as possible.

What is your overall win/loss ratio since testing these strategies ? I trade a similar strategy on the GBP/USD pair but have a 1.75 : 1 risk ratio to ensure I have more winning than losing months.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hi all;

Thank you for the EA Pr1mer and for great explanations pipimo88. My questions is for Pr1mer...

Will the EA execute a trade EVERY time it meets the definition of high+5 / low-5, or just the first time it's triggered, at which time it cancels the other order as well?

If it triggers every time, it might be a bit too much action

Thank You

--- 帖子 #557 ---
All the default params settings comply to the rules in post #1.

I just didn't know about closing the orders the following day. So CloseOrdersNextDay set to false (the default setting) will leave the orders opened the previous day. Setting it to true will close all the open orders at the end of the day.

There might be a bug, as I didn't test it much for using this EA in many pairs at once. I'll take a look at it.

Cheers,

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #558 ---
At the begining of the day there are buy/sell stop orders set - so they'll be triggered only once.

Cheers,

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Cool...Now that I've set CloseOrderNextDay to true I assume that the EA will simultaneously close any remaining open orders and calculate and enter the new orders for the next day ?

....yes, I guess we need to allow some time to smooth out any bugs...please keep us posted.

Yesterday, the EA's stops definitely worked on the GBPUSD trade.

So far so good.

mike

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Are you trading this manually along with the EA? It will be interesting to see how the 2 compare.

This is a great thread. I have been following it for a long time.

You presented the system back in August. I was just wondering how long before then that its been successful.

Thanks again.

Carol

--- 帖子 #561 ---
HidaBull,

This system is simply based on the probability of when price breaks above or below the previous days high or low and continues in the direction of that trend.

There has been discussion to the effect that the market tends to 'range' within the previous days high and low more than it 'trends' by 'breaking out'.

So regardless of the parameters, just bear in mind that this is just another 'system' to follow with discipline, and if the results are good then we're all happy.

Hi AfricanTrade.

I'm not sure how to accurately calculate a win/loss ratio when there are multiple profit targets involved...?

hello mikelath,

nice simple system you have here.  Well done.

I tried it for the first time today.  Don't know if I did everything right, but I got 95 pips on EURUSD, 95 on EURJPY, and lost 90 on USDJPY, for a net gain of 100 pips in total - very nice indeed!

Well done again

I've got absolutely the same results

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Me too.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi Carol.

Yes, while the EA is being tested and tweaked I am continuing to paper trade this strategy. If both the 'manual' and EA trades are with the same broker the results should be identical.

I don't give a lot of credence to backtesting mainly because of the lack of facilities available to accurately do so.... so I couldn't advise you on historical results. I think Pr1mer is wanting to do some kind of historical testing using an excel spreadsheet....he's hoping for help from bullrock in this regard. His logic (which is very sound) is that various pairs will perform better than others over different timeframes and visa versa. Therefore testing over a short period may not necessarily give an accurate analysis of which pairs perform better than others with this strategy.

Despite this, I am still basing my evaluation of this strategy mostly on forward tested results until I'm convinced otherwise. Having said that, the use of the EA will make it easier to trade multiple pairs without the hassle of having to manually place so many orders, thus eliminating the need of a shortlist in the hope of selecting only the best performing pairs.

Thanks, Mike.

I have been using the EA and I'm not getting any orders placed on the E/J. I'm using Interbank for the broker. Anyone else having problems?

Carol

--- 帖子 #569 ---
How nice if this EA thingy is available in Oanda.

However, if we do get this to work in Interbank. It seems like it is almost a set  and can totally forget about trading it and just see your balance grow? am I right?

Is that too good to be true?

I am also paper trading this method, and hoping to get good results..

Hi Mike

I am a fairly new comer to trading and came across your stratergy for trading 95 pips per day and gave it a try but i have a few questions if you don't mind?

1) Where on the net can i find the highs and lows for the close of each day ie the american day as there close is 6 in the morning here (SA)? I have search everywhere on the net and cannot find them. My platform clears the highs and lows before i am able to see them in the morning and does not store them anywhere?

2) Surely the most you can loose in a day is 180 pips if all 6 trades are excuded and hit there SL?

Thanks for the great stratergy!

which platform are you using?, most come with some kind of chart package and alot will run through MT4.

I would suggest you ask your provider,  all you need then is to open a daily chart and you are sorted.

Great thansk i will contact them. I am using GCI platform, not the greatest though!!

I  made this basic EA for this system, It performs well in last few months, but if you backtest it to last year datafeed, bad...

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Carol.

The brokers I'm using for testing the EA are ODL and North Finance.

I'm not sure about Interbank however I am also experiencing 'bugs' with the EA. It seems to work on some pairs and not others....I've also noticed that the stops are not being moved up to BE after the first profit target is reached... Pr1mer has stated that he will continue testing to smooth out any malfunction. I'm now waiting for an update.

Hi gyfu.

Yes, it would be nice if Oanda hosted EA's as I have a live account them.

I'm waiting for an update from Pr1mer as to the efficiency of the EA.

Once the EA is working properly this will indeed be a true set and forget system.

Flipmode,

By SA i assume you mean South Africa. Try downloading a demo version of Metatrader 4 from Alpari or Interbankfx, both give you real time data as part of the demo. In this software if you use the 1D timeframe you should be getting the high and low for each day.

You can lose a maximum of 180 points per pair per day. I think Mikelath is trading 3 pairs so his max loss is 540 points.

I've seen Mikelath's testing results and they look impressive but I am concerned that the risk ratio is not high enough and over time when the cluster of losses come the strategy will struggle. BUT that is something that only backtesting and forward testing can prove.

Regards.

I'm new to this, what is an EA? By the discussions above it seems that it's a program to automatically enter in your orders, is that correct ?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
The premier doesn't make sense in the backtest, do you people know how to backtest in mt4?

The EA I wrote is simple, and makes what is the system. The lots are 1 always. For testing is good.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Yes, that's correct.

Great Thanks i will have a look at Metatrader 4.

I like this stratergy, managed to do 95 pips this morning on the GBP/USD but i agree with your risk ratio....only time will tell i suppose.

hello there all people back after a long holiday in australia. Anyways people i had asked some people to back test my strategy but it doens't seem to work. Well so lets then SCRAP that and i have something new here your supposed to aim for 20 pips and ''SIGNAL 1'' works incredibly well from the other 2. I have had a 8:1 win/loss ratio till now. I am attaching it. Ok here you are supposed to take the high,low,close and open from Gmt 0. This works mainly for eur/usd, gbp/usd, aud/usd and nzd/usd.

Hi

How many entrys for each Signal?

For example:

SIGNAL 2:

1 enter long at 2,0206 - SL 50 - TP 10

2 enter long at 2,0206 - SL 50 - TP 30

3 enter long at 2,0206 - SL 50 - TP 50

1 enter short at 2,0149 - SL 50 - TP 10

2 enter short at 2,0149 - SL 50 - TP 30

3 enter short at 2,0149 - SL 50 - TP 10

Is this correct???Or are 5 entrys for long and short with TP 10,20,30,40 and 50?

And in the signal 1 the long entry is at 2,0194 or 2,0214???and the short entry at 2,0154 or 2,0131..???

Forgiveness by my ignorance. Thanks.

Hey, bksujal...

Very interesting stuff. Obviously, the "Win %" so far makes it worth looking at.

I was thinking that your strategy might warrant a thread of its' own, since it is completely different than what this thread does... and we don't want to hijack Mike's thread . Just post here what you're calling it, if you wouldn't mind.

Thanks.

Hi Pr1mer.

I'm still not entirely clear on the difference between the 2 EA files....if we are supposed to use only one of them, how do I determine which one I should use?

mike

--- 帖子 #594 ---
MQ4 files are EA source files. You can take a look at it and see how it works - helpful for those who are into programming - so that it's not a blackbox. If you compile these files you get EX4, which I attach for your convenience.

Hi all.

Just a quick note on the Expert Advisor...

I'm continuing to test the EA created by pr1mer, and so far it seems to be working well. For Monday's trades, the orders were automatically calculated and placed, the stops were automatically adjusted to BE after the 1st PT was reached, thus locking in profits when price retraced, and of course, all 3 profit target were taken when reached.

I'm just not sure if it is consistently calculating new orders for all the pairs I have it attached to...everyday. Time will tell if more tweaking is required.

Hi Mike,

I attached the EA to 3 currencies. E/J, U/J and E/U. It worked fine on the U/J and E/U, and profitted 15 pips each. But it never placed the orders on E/J. I am using the latest EA that pr1mer posted, on post #584. I'm using Interbank charts.

Carol

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Hi Carol. I'm glad you've shared your encounter because I was wondering if I was the only one having the same experience....:surprised

I think/hope that pr1mer is continuing to test the EA and eradicate any remaining bugs. In the meantime, I guess we just need to a be a little more patient.

The positive side is that we are now getting a glimpse of the full potential of this strategy once the EA is fully functional. It will indeed turn out to be a set and forget system as I'd hoped.

mike

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hi Mike,

I know when the EA is bug free, it will work like a charm. I see that happening soon.

I am very appreciative that you presented this system to the board. I believe it is a great one. I just hope it continues to work for a very long time.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hi mikelath and Pr1mer,

I'm testing the Ea and I've the same problem of Carol.

I've tried to change the daily start hour to 2 for eurjpy and today it has worked fine. Maybe it's only a dailystart hour trouble?

thank you for your efforts!

Pr1mer,

Thanks for working on this EA to make it better. I appreciate your efforts.

5 pairs i see here so the rule is to make a pending order for usdjpy long and short 5 pips below the low and 5 pips above the high and eurojpy long and short 5 pips below the low and 5 pips above the high and the same for the rest of the pairs right go long and short on 5 pairs is that correct so i should have 5 buys and 5 sells is that correct

--- 帖子 #610 ---
i believe it's more like

5 Pairs  each pair has 3 long and 3 short

so a total of 30 pending orders.  not completly sure as only just added this thread to my watch list.

from what i gather you should be placeing orders at this time of day too.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Correct. 6 pending orders for each pair. 3 long and 3 short.

Based on performance so far the results of a shortlist of pairs are being recorded on this thread. We are now down to EURJPY, USDJPY and EURUSD which have proven to be the best performers so far.

The use of the EA will also eliminate any confusion because then absolutely NO understanding of the strategy is required.

mike

--- 帖子 #612 ---
for what it's worth i've been playing around with this system recently.  i'm now only trading eur/jpy but will open pending orders on other pairs in the direction of the prior trend IF price has closed near the previous day's low.  eg have opened pending shorts on cable for today.

i've also applied a different TP method - 1tp at +20, 2nd at +30 leave the third open and try and move this to break even when the others are green, then lower it above / below recent resistance, not very mechanical but enables me to not be glued to the screen all night.

yesterday ej results were +20,+30 and +63

--- 帖子 #613 ---
did anyone's EJ shorts trigger then stop out almost as quickly?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
First off - thanks for the thread and all of the work everybody has put into this system.  I up loaded the EA and had it fire pending orders in a demo account for the first time this trading day.

Yes, I did have the EJ's buy orders filled at time 00:00:00 and hit the SL at 00:00:14 (14 seconds later) with a 30 pip MAX loss on each of the 3 orders.  Looking back on the charts, it appears that the buy/stop was never reached so I am not sure what happened.

Any insights or is this a question that needs to go to the platform technocrats when they wake up?

Hi,

Interesting thread..

I have posted an excel spreadsheet here
http://www.sendspace.com/file/8pk0u4

(click on the link and then right click and 'save as')

showing the entry points and 'possible' trades for the last year on the JPYUSD. I refer to them as being 'possible trades' because it does make any allowances for the volatility of the price on the day (e.g the trade may have been initiated and then the price fell 30 pips and then reversed to bring the trade into profit)

The OHLC data has been downloaded from Updata (UK) - if there are another pairs you would like me to post - please leave a message (alternatively you can put in OHLC into columns b,c,d,e

--- 帖子 #616 ---
This is my first time using EA with MT4.  I have a couple of questions:

#1

As soon as I attached the EA to the chart should I see the order lines placed on the chart?  Buy Stop, Sell Stop, and the TP levels?

I have attached the EA and I have the smiley face, but orders are not being placed for any of the pairs.  (FYI, I have live trading enabled).

#2

DayStartHour Input.

Is this the time shown in MT4?  For example, I have a demo account with Interbank FX and 00:00 in their platform corresponds to 8:00pm EST for me.  Also, are times entered in 24-hour format.  For example, 1500, or do I need to enter 15:00 with the colon?

If I can figure out how to get the EA to work correctly I can help test/debug the system. (I have programming experience with other packages).

Thanks,

Steve

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I don't think you will see any orders placed until the opening of the new day. I think it waits to get a reading of the high and low of the previous day before placing orders. Anyway, that's the way it was working for me.

Carol

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I thought I am going to post something useful.

I have started to write a bit of code for a serious backtest in c++.

Now the first findings. I have just tested the long side.

The original settings on 15 min data for the this year since the 10th of January resulted +619 pips. No spread and other stuff.

With 50 SL and 50/70/100 TPs and the fourth unit running till the end of the day resulted +2640 pips. No BE.

I will post more later.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Thanks Carole, I played with the DayStartHour to the nearest hour so I could watch the EA work.  Everything appeared onto the chart after the hour started.

FYI, I believe the answer to my #2 question, is simply enter the DayStartHour without minutes.  So, 15:00 would be entered as 15

Thanks again,

Steve

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Never mind.

Problem fixed!

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi BR

this is slightly different to the original plan, have you looked at the original plan also or just your settings?

Also are you backtesting in Excell as normal and if so were do can start to learn this method, i can use excell fairly well and know were to download the data, jst not sure about testing it.  PM me if you would so as not to clog up the thread.

regards

MPP

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Ok MPP just thought will post some findings I have made.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Thanks Makepeace for sharing the spreadsheet.

The results are somewhat reassuring however inconclusive if the stoploss is not included into the calculations.

The reality is that price often does retrace just after triggering entry, even before the first profit target is reached. So we can therefore conclude that a certain % of the trades shown on the spreadsheet would have to accommodate this scenario.

Yesterday's trades are a good example....both EJ and UJ retraced and stopped out before the 1st PT was reached...

It's great to see that you've done this analysis, and if it's possible to factor in the 30pip stop that would be even better.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hey Mike,

Are you moving your Stop Loss orders manually everytime the first Take Profit is hit?

I use Trailing Stops, so everytime you lock in 15 pips on EURUSD, i get -15 pips for the same pair...

EUR/USD

1st lot: +15

2nd lot: -15

3rd lot: -15

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hi BlindMist.

I am currently taking the results of the EA being used in a North Finance and ODL demo accounts.

The EA is programmed to move the stops to breakeven after the first profit target of +15pips has been reached.

I've considered the use of trailing stops however the broker that I started testing this strategy with (Oanda) does not provide them. On the other hand, any MT4 platform should have trailing stops so it could possibly be incorporated into the EA. Maybe adding a trailing stop to the 3rd order once the 2nd PT has been reached would be feasible.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Using trailing stops on MT4 (InterbankFX) you need to be 1 pip past your profit target for it to work. ie: when you hit 16 pips it will trail to 1, 17 to 2, etc. It also needs to be on each order.

Thanks for all the work on this thread!

Hello, everybody, this is my first post here, and i DID read all the posts b4 writing.

I have been testing this ea Daily95pips.0.3.ex4 for the past few days and what i see is, it opens up pending orders and then if one currency is hit, then it deletes all the rest of them, something tells me that it needs to be adjusted, so in case the rest of the pairs reach there level and not just one.

Even though +110pips for the week is still good, relative to other weeks it could certainly be better. I'll wait another week or two before reassessing.

I just came across this thread and I was amazed to see that the system espoused is VERY similar to one I use.

I trade 4 pairs: GBP/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/AUD, GBP/JPY.  I chose these pairs because for the most part they are non-correlated.

I enter 2 trades on each pair:

- Long on daily high + 5 pips (10 pips for GBP/JPY)

- Short on daily high - 5 pips (10 pips for GBP/JPY)

I have a SL of the 33% of the 22-day ATR

and a TP of 66% of the 22-day ATR.

For GBP/USD that means that I have a SL of about 50 pips and a TP of about 100 pips.  And for GBP/JPY I have a SL of about 90 pips and a TP of about 180 pips.

When the market is trending I make out like a bandit, however when the market is ranging (like is was for the 1st 2 weeks of October) I get killed.

I'm currently working on trying to incorporate daily ADX to determine when the market is trending or ranging.  I'm thinking that I'll only enter trades when ADX is above 25 and sloping up.  I'll stay out if ADX is sloping down.  I haven't tried this yet, but I'll start next week.  Hopefully it will help me stay out of the market when I know my strategy doesn't work.

I'm also trying to come up with a way where I can take partial profits (like the OP does) along the way; but I want to keep my 2:1 win:loss ratio and I don't want to have my SL too close.  I like to give the market a little "breathing room".

Anyway, I couldn't help putting in my $0.02 because my strategy is so close to the OPs.

Hi mike...

What EJ EU and uj the best for trade this strategy?

Good luck

Can anyone help me to understand...

First of all - I am excited about the potential with this method and would love to try this live (using tiny tiny lots to start of course...)  Because of my work schedule, I cannot always be at my trading computer to start the trades.  The EA is perfect for me.

That being said, I am running the EA on an Interbank platform and am not sure how the EA is determining the entry points for the orders.

For example:  Friday's USDJPY - Sell stop was placed at 115.53  My platform shows an end of day close at 115.54 with a daily low of 115.27 reached in the last  4 hours of the trading day.

My thinking the Sell stop should have been placed at 115.22.

Insights please!!!!

Thanks Tim

--- 帖子 #645 ---
the same question as mine:

i thought, it cause the lookbackhours was set to 17, so the ea is not looking for last day low, instead of last 17 hours low..

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hello, everybody, this is my first post here, and i DID read all the posts b4 writing.

I have been testing this ea Daily95pips.0.3.ex4 for the past few days and what i see is, it opens up pending orders and then if one currency is hit, then it deletes all the rest of them, something tells me that it needs to be adjusted, so in case the rest of the pairs reach there level and not just one.

and another thing is... it opens up only 3 currencies? Any ideas why?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Daystarthour - hour in your timezone/used by your broker when the forex day starts = when you want your stop orders placed.
Lookbackhours - how many hours to look back when calculating day high / low
OrderExpirationHours - after how many hours do stop orders expire.

Thanks for your observations. Maybe that is the reason of the weird EA behaviour for multiple pairs. I'll dig into it.

That may be a good exaple what trailing stop in the last order might bring. Any ideas?

Question about the EA (daily95pips.0.3), I just started using it last night on the USDCHF.

It set the buy stop at 1.1742, it got trigged and hit my first TP. But I see that all 3 stop losses are set to 1.1742 as well, and the last two trades hit this and stopped. Price came no where near 1.1712 (what the stop should have been)

I'm confused as to why the stop loss is/was set the same as the buy stop price instead of 30 pips below. The pending sell stop orders have the correct 30 pip stop loss as well as both sets of orders on a different currency pair.

It seems like it moved all the active trade stop losses to break even after it hit the 1st t/p but I didn't check the stops before I left for the night so I'm not exactly sure. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Tried it yesterday, and it worked like a charm.

But Monday session was like 400 pips wide, can we really expect it to move near the 5 a.m GMT level in 24 hrs?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Greetings Pr1mer sir.

Yes, it was a good day. All 3 pairs achieved +95pips. Some other pairs like GBPUSD also got +95pips.

The idea of adding a trailing stop to the last order is good.

If it's not too much trouble for you to add it to the EA that would be great.

Maybe a 20pip trailing stop activated when the 2nd PT is reached would be sufficient.  What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Anyone?

All the stop losses are correct until something happens which I can't figure out. GBPCHF recently hit 2.3957 which triggered the buy stop, now all 3 trades have been stopped out at 2.3957. But the stop losses should have been 2.3927.... ???

I think when it triggers the order, it automatically sets the stop loss to the current price. What is going on? This also just happened on NZDUSD

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I just tested this ea for 3 days. And I have this question that some orders are pending while some are not. I use it in EUR, JPY, GPB, EUR/JPY

First day, I use one name "daily95pips.03" as the ea name on 4 pairs, only EUR (the first chart) have pendings.

Second day, I changed the ea names into 4name "95pips-eur" "95pips-jpy"...etc, result is the same, only EUR have pendings.

Third day, I edited two of the ea "95pips-eurjpy" and "95pips-gbp", result is, EUR, EUR/JPY, GBP placed pendinds.

Conclusion, I think in mulitple pairs, we should give them different names, since ea give magic numbers according the the name of ea.

To PR1mer: Can you help me to check it. Is this a bug or only I have this problem? Thanks very much.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
This should be the function to protect our money.

When price up to certain point, stop loss will edit to break even, so that we can sit back and relax to have 100% positive results. We can still have 15pts (the first TP in this ea) even the last 2 orders go to SL

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Something like this would be nice... but there is zero room for movement when it's doing what it's doing now. I haven't been able to watch it happen real-time, but I'm thinking the stop loss gets moved to break even the moment the buy/sell stops are triggered.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #660 ---
I have see that in other ea, it has the function for us to choose whether we can choose move  the SL to BE or not.  Maybe we can suggest  Pr1mer  to help us later.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Ok, I just watched it happen in real-time. A buy stop was triggered on AUDUSD @ 05:59. Price was hanging around 0.8920 for several minutes, when suddenly @ 06:17 my stop losses change from 30 pips away from my buy price to the buy price! Price remains hovering at that same point.

That's 18 minutes from open until my stop losses were changed, only configurable thing I can find currently set at 18 is OrderExpirationHours. I think something is messed up...

--- 帖子 #662 ---
To armrd08:

EA moves SL to B/E after reaching first TP. That's the original idea suggested by Mike. In next version I can add a setting when (if at all) to move to B/E point.

To cashfinder:

I'm glad some took a look into the EA source

Your solution is nice but not convenient for everyone. I have already fixed multiple pairs problem by simplifying EA by just adding Magic Number setting. It'll be available soon.

To mikelath:

I'll just add a new setting to next version of EA to turn on/off trailing stop (with adjustable number of pips) to the last order. Than we'll be able to test whether it's better.

Cheers,

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #663 ---
To be honest with you, so far its the BEST ea that i have ever tried, i been testing it since last thursday and i am at +270 pips and i did not have any loosing trades yet (knock on wood). Keep up a great work!!!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Well that would explain why it's doing it.  Isn't this dramatically crippling the EA though? Even with this problem, it's still performing well, but I'm missing a lot of T/Ps because the trade doesn't have room to move. Also, I watched the SL move to B/E when price was 10 pips away from the first T/P and a lot of trades hit the SL (same as buy/sell price) on all 3 orders which couldn't happen if it waited until it hit the 1st T/P. So there might be a bug there.

Where would I find the place to remove or alter this function? Thanks

Mike, Pr1mer and all

Is anyone else getting wrong order entry prices besides myself?  My order entry points appear to be incorrect for all pairs.

For example, Mike's results shows a nt for the Eurusd for the 10/23 trading day.   Since the 10/23 traded all day within the range of the 10/22, I understand Mike's results.  Yet, my EA placed 3 buy orders which all ended with a 30 pip loss.

The EA in my demo account incorrectly placed the order entry point for the buys at 1.4207.  I have not touched the default settings.  Shouldn't have the order entry point for the buys been 5 pips above the previous 17 hour high?

Am I the only one with this problem?  Am I missing something?

Thanks

Tim

Why don't try it out manually mate? I know its bugging to sit and calculate the values but whats the problem if the end result is hopefully profitable.

For anyone to answer,

I just came across with this system and I find it interesting. My only doubt is that the high+5 and low+5 is from the high and low of the day before or just from the last candle at 17:00 est? Thank you for your help.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I have a question that has probably been answered but I didnt find it..is there a time that we should start this EA running? When should IT start trading?? Or should we just let it run 24/7??

I have it on IBFX and NF

Thanks

TM

--- 帖子 #675 ---
There are a lot of breakthrough system which usually starts at 0GMT against last 24hours data.

To my understanding, Daily95pips place orders at 0 gmt and trace back  17 hours before.

Please point me if I am wrong.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I am using IBFX and I open this ea 24/7.

It places orders at around 0 GMT (I don't know exactly the time coz I am working at that time)

I am using demo account with ea. And I manually place orders on my live account. (Waiting for new version)

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hello Mike,

This time i got completely different results:

EURJPY -90

EURUSD -90

EU actually did come very close to reaching the 1st PT (about 2-3 pips), however it retraced way below the BE; hence the result

EY only managed to go 11 pips above the previous Daily High, so I'm kinda puzzled now... How did you manage to get 45 pips of profit on this pair?

P.S. I'm using Daily Highs/Lows; Daily candle closes at 18:00 EST

--- 帖子 #681 ---
I think I read somewhere that the high/low calculations cover the previous 17 hours and not the full previous 24 hours. That may give you the difference. I have been using Primers daily 95 bars indicator and this uses the previous 24 hour high and low and this gave me EURJPY -90 USDJPY NT and EURUSD 95

I tested this on AUD/USD back one year, and it ended with a few dollars left in the account... What am i doing wrong?

Can someome please PM me for help setting this up properly

It has something to do with this:

I might be an idiot, but this strategy looks fucked up when i backtest it.  Not one currency pair gains money... I don't understand what I am doing wrong, or how I get all three stop losses activated at one time.

How come is posting the same loss three times?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
hmmm

strange day......

i wonder how mikelath got the results

so we suppose to use previous 17hrs instead of full 24hrs ?????

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi !!!!.

It is possible to get this results on EURUSD if you don´t move the stop to BE...but...

Please, can you give us some numbers??...(Entry point, Hours...)

--- 帖子 #685 ---
I have an spreadsheet for that - Problem is I cannot always be at my trading computer at the time to do the calcs and place the orders.  For me, the EA would give me the opportunity to trade this system daily instead of occasionally...

--- 帖子 #686 ---
What is the point in going back manually and doing it? your going to have EA execute the trades anyway, so it has to backtest to a profit. and the fact is that it doesn't, it will clear out your account within 8 months according to my backtest.

I must be doing something wrong.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hi,

New version of EA is ready.

I have finally fixed problem with using EA for multiple pairs.

Additionally, I have added trailing stop feature and possibility to adjust break-even move.

Below I'll describe new settings, for others look for description in post #541 (http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=541).

UpdateToBE - number of pips in profit, when stoploss is moved to break-even point, e.g. when set to 15 - stop loss will be moved to opening price after reaching 15 pips profit. If you want to move SL to b/e when first take profit is taken, set to the same value as TakeProfit1 setting. The same goes for TP2, TP3.

UseTrailingStopOnLastOrder, TrailingStop - these are tricky ones

When UseTrailingStopOnLastOrder is set to false, there will simply be no trailing stop for last order  So take profit will be taken at the value of TakeProfit3. TrailingStop setting value is insignifficant in this case.

When UseTrailingStopOnLastOrder is set to true, trailing stop will be activated when order reached TakeProfit3 pips value. Trailing stop value is then equal to TrailingStop setting value.
Example:

We have TakeProfit3=50, UseTrailingStopOnLastOrder=true, TrailingStop=20.

Let's assume that buy orders were opened at the price of 1.2350. At the level of 1.2400 we'll have 50 pips of profit (for simplicity of this example spread is not taken into account). From now on, whenever price goes up, stop loss for last order will be moved to 20 pips below actual price. For example, let's take such sequence:

1) price - 1.2400, sl - 1.2380

2) price - 1.2405, sl - 1.2385

3) price - 1.2402, sl - 1.2385

4) price - 1.2407, sl - 1.2387

5) price - 1.2405, sl - 1.2387

etc.

EAMagicNumber - for advanced users only. It is a random number generated for this EA. Change is when using other EAs for the same account and they happen to use the same magic number (very unprobable). There's no need to change this value for different pairs - EA attached to a chart will only manage orders with magic number equal to EAMagicNumber setting and symbol correstponding to this chart.

I did some forward testing, but it's still not enough. That's where your role begins

Waiting for results, options, etc.

Have a nice weekend

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #688 ---

Pr1mer,

I read this thread a while ago but didn't realize there was an EA being made.

I have 3 computers dedicated to forward testing and an FTP server that I can have forward tested results auto-updated to through MT4, so statements are easy to check in real time with a bookmark.

Thanks to Pr1mer for the continuted programming for all of us unspoken viewers of this thread.  I have been trying to backtest the strategy on Metatrader, and the results are always negative and don't match up with my manual backtesting of the strategy.  I am setting the period to H1 and leaving all other settings at their default.  Also, I live in the Pacific time zone, so what should my settings be for the day start hour if my broker open/closes the trading day at 2 PM PT, 5 ET?  Thanks again for all the work on this thread.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
This is going to be a complicated EA to backtest.  Every broker has a different time zone, you need to understand what time zone your broker is in in relation to EST 5:00.

Once you have that setting correct.  You cannot test for more than 6 months at a time with that setting.  DAYLIGHT SAVINGS!!  The broker time in relation to your time may change twice a year.  Being aware of this you might have to only backtest 6 months at a time and add the results together somehow.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I just don't understand why the EA backtest keeps comming back extremely negative, I have the timezone correct, even in one month intervals it comes back negative.

yes, but if every single currency ends negative then it shouldn't matter.

Are we supposed to use 5pm EST as the time for all currency pairs or just JPY pairs?  That may make a huge difference.

Time frame also seems to affect it, when i back tested the USD/JPY for this week I was positive but at different levels on each time frame.

Back test results on USD/JPY for this week.

up 172 pips on the four hour time from 72 pips on the 1 hour time frame.

up 88 pips on the 15 minute time frame.

up 32 pips on a 1 minute time frame.

up 404 pips on a 5 minute time frame

I guess it is impossible to use EA to backtest this because of how to acts in the real world.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Let the forward testing commence.  I got a bad headache trying to figure out timezones vs brokers at 2am last night for my alpari data.  Will try again today.

Of course, the problem with forward testing is you won't even know a setting is bad for weeks.

i am using interbankfx. i need to change the dualy start hour?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I'm a bit confused about the time setting

DayStartHour - hour in your time zone that starts the forex day

If I am using IBFX who is at GMT even with the DST change and I am in EST what am I going to use for the daystarthour??? 8 for the US open??

If I ever get over this hurdle then forex life will get a whole lot easier

--- 帖子 #698 ---
First I would like to say that this is a great thread. It has taken me a couple of days to digest all of the information and come to grips with the logic of this system. I would also like to say that Pr1mer is one of the best programmers I have ever met in one of these forums.

Having said that I would like to offer the following. I only use IBFX for my demo trading and have had a lot of experience with them.

If you are using IBFX you will need to set your DayStartHour to 21.The IBFX demo server is currently on EST+4 hours.

The second problem with IBFX is that they do not start their trading day on Sunday until 18:00 EST. Using the Expert for this system will not generate any trades for the Sunday/Monday session since it is set to put in the orders at 17:00EST. I have made a change to the expert to take this into account.

Also, when using IBFX, you will only look back 16 bars for the Sunday/Monday session buystop and sellstop orders since there is an hour missing with their 16:00 EST close on Friday and their 18:00 EST open on Sunday.

I have altered the expert to take this into account as well.

Please be advised that the expert that I have attached is the .04 current version of Pr1mer's expert with changes that only work with IBFX. It must be attached to your chart and active Sunday @ 18:00 EST - 18:59 EST to get the first days trades set.

I would like to close by saying that if Pr1mer does not want anyone altering his/her programming, please let me know and I will not post any changes again.  His/her programming knowledge is far superior to mine and I would not want to offend him/her in any way.

I hope that my input is helpful.

Well, this is the first day that i am trying new EA, and here are my observations. For some reason it bought double orders on usd/chf pair, not sure why,(but it needs to be checked into - if its a profit its great, but when its a loss, its a double one and that sucks!) i have it attached only to one of them. I did not change any settings on it. It started out with 0.2 lots and on the last currency it bought 0.1 lot, so that part is working good. So far all in all i am $135 up - 75 pips, so lets see what tomorrow will bring

Thanks for a great job!!!

Please Note that I run the expert with set lots of .10 on a standard account for test purposes.  I also run a separate expert for each pair with the EAMagicNo changed for each pair.  This is just my way of doing it.  It is a very complicated expert and some have stated that it is not opening the correct amount of pending orders while using the same expert on all pairs at the same time.

Thanks for compliments

Actually, I'm really glad that someone finally took a look into my code, hope it's not too messy

Generally, I'd like to maintain one version of this EA not to confuse readers of this thread. However in case of different brokes I don't know if it's possible. These differences give me headache. I have to look how others solve this problem. I know it may be complicated for some people here with time zone shifts, but I don't know any other (simpler) sollution.

Thanks for your input PipHunter196

There's no need to change magic number for EA running on multiple pairs. This problem has been solved in this version (according to my tests). If something is wrong, write me.

Cheers,

Pr1mer

Thanks for your kind words Pr1mer. I agree that there is a need to keep the versions of this expert to a minimum. As far as your code goes, it is fantastic! It has actually taught me a couple of things about programming in MQL. Thanks for the lession.

As far as the EAMagicNo, and running separate experts for each pair, that is just my way of doing testing. I have found that the problem is not in the coding of the experts that run on multiple pairs, but it must be some problem within MT4 itself and the handling of the experts. I have had several experts that have had the same problem with handling orders while running on multiple pairs. It is definitely not a problem with your programming. This is just my way of getting around the problem.

Here is hoping we have another Pipfull day tomorrow.

Can you help me with converting your IBFX setting to ALPARI setting.

ALPARI starts at 00:00 Monday (EST +6)

Regards  Thommy

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Tuttler,

I will help If I can.  I need to know what time it shows on your charts when the last 1H candle is formed on Friday and when the first 1H candle is formed Sunday Night or Monday Morning. Be advised, I NEED THE TIME IT SHOWS AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR MT4 CHART ALONG WITH WHAT THE DIFFERENCE OF YOUR BROKERS SERVER TIME IS FROM EST.

With this information I Should be able to adjust the program to help you.

I am assuming that your brokers server time is +6 hours from EST. Let me know if my assumption is correct.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
I just found this thread and have a couple of questions that I wanted some clarification on.  Is everyone using the original 17 hours from the close of the 5pm NY close candle or are we using the entire previous day from 5:01pm to 4:59 pm est time NY session close the next day.  I do not trade with a broker that supports metatrader and have to enter trades without the aide of the EA.  Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #709 ---

This is my second day of testing new EA i have a problem, i guess you missed my other post... it bought USD/CHF twice, so instead of 6 orders i got 12!!!

So, i thought that it did that cuz i dragged the ea to the chart and i did not delete the old one, so i closed the account, deleted all old ea's and started fresh, and the result did not change, still double on that only pair. Could you see whats wrong?

Hi,

I've read through this thread and noticed that the original strategy suggested trading more pairs. Is the decision to trade the 3 above based on the correlation of the various other pairs or is the decision based on the levels of volatility in those markets?

Was just wondering as CAD seems to move independently of other influences so might make a tidy profit without being too correlated to the other instruments.

Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Hi Ted1983,

Welcome to the forum!

Other pairs are being tested by other thread members, but as of yet I have not seen any results posted. I personally am sticking to the 3 original pairs that Mikelath came up with.

Maybe you could test the CAD an give us some results.

Have a Pipfull Day

Everyone,

Just a reminder that EST will set clocks back 1 hour this weekend to DST. This will effect the Experts that I have posted with specific time changes for different brokers. You will need to find out how this change will affect your broker server time, if there is any effect at all.

I will post an updated version of the IBFX expert this weekend that will take into account the time change.

Tuttler - You will need to let me know about Alpari so that I can make changes to it as well if needed!

Thanks,

Have a PipFull Day!

Hi Piphunter,

I might give it a try. I was attracted to this kind of breakout trading due to its' "set and forgetiness" and the fact that it can take advantage of any volatility during sleepy time.

Also at the moment I am looking towards incorporating a portfolio of stategies to try and create a smooth equity curve (although this is a long way off) and something like this may definitely find a place in my arsenal.

I believe that this kind of strat will benefit greatly from using a wide variety of non-correlated instruments. Anyone using it on gold,oil etc?

BTW has anyone tried this with a trend filter (eg only long above 50EMA.)

I would love to be able to test this using MT4, alas my shitty computer skills do not extend to modifying an EA let alone writing my own.

Pip Ahoy!

--- 帖子 #725 ---
I am not very skilled with programming indicators, and I think it would take away from the original theory of this system. It is strictly based on price action and it works well this way.

Be advised that anyone that has downloaded the Alpari Version that I posted will notice that the orders are not going in at the correct time. It was made with the changes for DST and will not act correctly until Sunday night. You can change the DayStartHour to 22 for the rest of this week and it will act correctly.

Have a PipFull Day!

Hi PipHunter.

It's refreshing to see someone else besides myself post their results in an orderly fashion. The fact that you are posting results from an IBFX account will help to illustrate that results (once time settings are in sync) from the exact same EA can vary between brokers. Monday was a good example of this where you got +15pips on EU and I got -90pips in North Finance.

I've been testing EJ, UJ and EU in North Finance and EU,GU,UC,UJ,EJ,GJ and AU in ODL and I often see varied results between EJ, UJ and EU in both accounts.

Thanks for the contribution of altering the EA to suit IBFX as this will allow greater participation.   I might give it a try myself.

ooops...I just noticed that these 2 brokers are 2 hrs apart......thus the varied results because the EA calculates the orders at different times....in this case...price still can vary between brokers...

--- 帖子 #729 ---
mikelath, first i would like to thanks you for show your system here.

i don't want to criticise (really not) but did you know about the hans123 system and his big drawdown? you took it in consideration?

i don't want to criticise him too. i only want to know if you took it in consideration when created the system and if you backtested it at the same period that hans had the big dd.

thanks and sorry, my english is very bad.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi giraia.

No, I'm not familiar with the hans123 system....I've tried to do a search for it to no avail...if you can provide a link to the post that describes the strategy I can take a look at it....

If the hans123 system also uses multiple profit targets and moves stops to BE after profit targets are reached and STILL experienced a large drawdown then I will be cautious of this occuring with the D95P strategy.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Hi all,

I just ran the IBFX EA on the strategy tester (on an IB acccount) and it is showing a -ve curve. Now I know that the tester is notoriuosly unreliable but I thought that the simplicity of this system would not compromise the test results, and therefore the modelling quality need not be so high. Could I have the settings wrong or is the MT4 tester really such a useless piece of junk?

--- 帖子 #732 ---
here is his site
http://www.myfxreport.com/hans123.htm

and the results
http://myfxreport.com/downloads/Hans_Indrionas.xls

hope this help

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Backtesting in MT4 for this system will not work for a few different reasons:

1) The time changes that go on during the year will change the calculations.

2) The only way to truely backtest a system in MT4 is to import tick data and use it on a 1M chart. In order to do this the EA would need to be rewritten to account for using a 1M chart. The tick modeling that is used by MT4 on the 1 hour charts that you get is from 1M data and the program basically guesses how the ticks went within the 1H bar and 1M bar based on the smaller time frames. The key to this is that MT4 GUESSES/MODELS the ticks. This is why the backtester is not trustworthy the way it is currently used by most people.

Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #734 ---
It needs to be stated that there are a lot of differences between this system and the hans123 system. I have also noticed that hans123 has been reading this thread as well.

I used to follow the hans123 system quite closely and I believe that the way this system is structured will save on the big draw-downs. IMHO

--- 帖子 #735 ---
yes, he is reading. i saw it a few minutes.

i will read the results again but i don't know exactally what happened to his account. i think there is only the results in pips. i don't know what was his mm too.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Thanks for links giraia.

Hmmm...yes, the strategy is similar in that the setup is the same (5pips above and below the high and low) however the stops and profit targets are different, and multiple profit targets are not used by hans123. D95P moves stops to BE after the 1st PT has been reached, thus locking in partial profits...hans123 system moves stops to BE after price has moved somewhat (according to the pair) however it's still possible that the trades will stopout without ANY profits. Both strategies have the potential of stopping out for a loss....

Regarding:
If a certain position is taken and price turns                against you and it breaks the other side of the breakout channel                then turn. If the breakout channel is broader then the stoploss                first the stoploss will be hit. If the breakout channel is                narrower then the stoploss then hitting the other side means that                you have to turn your position. There is only one turn per time                frame possible. This rule is a result of all previous rules. You                can skip this rule if you want.

I'd definitely be inclined to skip this rule and would not be surprised if this was the cause of the large drawdown. I don't see the point in trying to 'chase' price. If price movement triggers the orders and reaches profit targets that's very good...if it doesn't I'm happy to move on and wait for the next day.

Another consideration that comes to mind is the pairs chosen. One of the objectives with the D95P thread is to shortlist the best performing pairs with the parameters of this strategy. Surprisingly, of the 2 pairs suggested for hans123 GBPUSD hasn't made the D95P shortlist....however EURUSD has.

At the end of the day I see the only mildly accurate similarity being the initial setup ( 5pips above and below the high and low).

That being said, any mechanical system is always subject to performing better of worse depending on market conditions and I thank you for bringing this to my attention.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
I see,

I did try it with M1 data which stated 90% modelling quality.Would the MT4 period converter be up to the job?

--- 帖子 #738 ---
I am going to state this again just so everyone gets the same clear picture:

YOU CANNOT BACK TEST THIS SYSTEM WITH THIS EXPERT!!!

If you run this expert in the backtester on a 1M chart it will only look back 17 minutes before it is suppose to place the orders! This is why it will not work. No matter what chart you run this expert on it will only look back 17 periods (or in other words, bars) prior to placing the pending orders for the day. If you run it on a 1H chart the tick modeling is not accurate, no matter what the modeling quality is. So please do yourself a favor and stop trying.

In regards to the period converter for MT4, it is designed to make larger period bars from smaller period ones. Example, 1H bars from 30M or 30M from 1M.

Over the weekend I will try to make some adjustments to the expert and make one for testing purposes only.

Hope This Helps!

Pippopotamus,

Everything is possible. The problem is in the programming. I personally do not want to change the system because it seems to work good as it is. Every idea is welcome thou. I only do programming of EA's that are based on price movement. I am sorry that I will not be able to help you out on this one. Please take note of my posts on the Strategy Tester for MT4. Only under certain conditions is it reliable. And those are very few conditions.

Piphunter, are you using exactaly the same inputs that are in the ibfx version? and i was searching about margin and updateTobe and i didn't find about that. please help me to use it.

about backtesting, only metastock, tradestation and amibroker can be reliable. I have tested MT4 compraing backstet and the same period that i had used a EA running and the results were 100% diferent... and i was using alpari tick data.

the unique solution is that: anyone coding the system for metastock, tradestation and amibroker and backtest it using many years. but like piphunter said it is necessary to make ajusts for daylight time.

and sorry for my english again

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Giraia_br,

Yes I am using the expert exactly the way that I posted it with the exception of using fixed lots. You can change the FixedLots from 0.0 to .10, or what ever you want, to trade in the same lot size all of the time. You can leave the FixedLots = 0.0 and the expert will automatically risk 1% of your margin account for each trade. You can also change the Risk from .01 to a larger or smaller amount. Do not change the Margin because this is the setting used to decide how far to move the BS and SS above and below the high and low.

Hope this helps.

Hola everyone

This is my first post but have been in here for a bout week or so, reading, looking testing the EA etc. The new one from Pr1mer seems to make some changes that are not working the same way the older version did. My understanding here is the when a order goes into trade and the first TP of 15 points is reached, then S/L is moved up from -30 points at opening to the opening price so you can get at least 15 pips profit and if the market turns against you, you are stopped out at entry level. Well last night and today, this is not working correctly. I read somewhere last week that we can set a True False indicator to move the TP on the last 50 points, which is good but today I was killed in the markets twice, one on the Aussie dollar where the first 15 pips where taken, and the Stop Loss did not move, it stayed the same -30 pips from entry point, i had to manually close the positions this morning after waiting about 2 hours for them to reach break even, Then on the EUR USD same thing, see below for figures

EUR - USD

Buy 3 Lots 1.4448 1.4418 1.4463 1.4363 = Profit of 15 pips 450 Big Bucks

The remaining two lots then where stopped out at 1.4418 losing 900 each. That one hurt the days balance let me tell ya's

AUD USD

Buy 3 Lots 0.9227 0.9197 0.9242 0.9242 = Profit of 15 Pips 450 big bucks

Remaining to positions S/L remains at 0.9197 until i closed them out at 0.9227 opening price.

And also EU JPY shorts are still in the line to buy even though the Longs where profitable, they should have canceled when the buys where trigged.

I read somewhere last week the new EA has a feature to manually adjust the last 50 pip profit strategy, however we are talking here about the system making sure that after first 15 pips profit the S/L is moved to opening price and this is not happening. Also finally can someone explain to me the concept behind the magic number and should this be changed for each currency pair you run it on and then who changes it and this would then mean if you run 5 pairs you have 5 different EA's on your system for each currency and how do you get this to work, place all 5 ea;s in the experts, etc, let me know am interested in this area.

OK for first post its a lot but these are some issues I got and would like resolved.

Gracias por todo

--- 帖子 #760 ---
When you want to use EA for different pairs just drag the EA on the charts with these pairs. This creates different instances of EA for each pair.

Each EA manages orders that have corresponding EAMagicNumber and current chart's symbol, so you do NOT need to change this setting when using only this EA for different pairs (although you can, like PipHunter196 does).

This setting is handy when you want to use this EA several times for the same pair or with other EAs (just check if it's not using the same magic - highly unprobable).

Hope this helps.

Cheers,

Pr1mer

Hola

Firstly thanks Pr1mer for you answer, but still have a few from last post and some more tonite. Like dinka I can not PM and am using an ODL Account. My main issue at present is the Stop Loss and the movement of the Stop Loss from –30 at opening of the trade, until the first trade at 15 pips is taken, then the Stop Loss on the remaining two trades should move to the opening price, or the entry level at sale of first trade at plus 15 pips. This did not happen the other nite. Why Not please,,,,,,,. It did on the version before.Tonite when I see the orders all drop in at 7pm here in Panama, (12 GMT) the take profit @ 15 points, is shown as 000000 See attached word doc for examples. I am waiting to see what happens at the first entry of a trade. Any comment on the example attached from anyone who may have same problems.

Is this a correct assumption?

--- 帖子 #767 ---
The reason for this is that you have the trailing stop turned on for the third order. Thus it will not have a take profit since the stop will be your exit.

Turn it off and that should change.

You also do not have your time set up correctly. It should be entering at 17:00 EST which is 21:00 GMT. If your broker is on GMT you need to change this as well.

I am trying to work on the ODL USD/CHF Problem as well.

Have a PipFull Day

Hola Reddragon

I think you turn the Use TrailingStopOnLastOrder = true
That what happens try = false

I am not sure why people are having problems with the timing of EA and broker. In the EA it said "Day Start Hour = 0" And it means that regardless of what time your broker has it will open up new orders on the new bar, on the new day... or did i miss something?

BTW as far as results, been testing since 10/30/07

10/30

USD/JPY -90pips

AUD/USD +45pips

NZD/USD +15pips

GBP/JPY +45pips

GBP/USD +15pips

USD/CHF +15pip (second set of orders del manually)

EUR/USD never trigered

10/31

GBP/JPY -90pips

GBP/USD +15pips

USD/JPY +15pips

AUD/USD +45pips

USD/CHF -90pip

EUR/USD +15pips

Today so far

GBP/JPY +15pips

And the day is not over

Dinka,

Your are wrong in your assumption! The new pending orders are suppose to be opened at 17:00 EST which is currently -4 Hours from GMT. If your brokers server is on GMT then you should have this setting set to 21 (As I have stated in numerous posts.) Without having this set correctly, your testing numbers are no good.

Refer to Post#1 by Mikelath for the system rules.

Refer to Pr1mer Post for explanation of settings for EA.

Hope This Helps!!

Have a PipFull Day!

--- 帖子 #771 ---
I'm not sure why your results are different from mine, I am using the latest for IBFX and changed nothing in the EA and yesterday it lost overall 30 pips....I'm in the usa EST so everything should be set correctly with no changes needed...........

would you please post your set file or create one and post it??

Many thanks

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Hi,

What time frame do you use the EA on? I have mine set to 1 hour? I have the EUR/JPY, GBP/USD and the USD/JPY on it. Is this correct? Can I use more pairs, will it work with other pairs? Also , my platform is on gmt time +2. Do I put 22 for the time start or still stick with 0?Thank you, Paris

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Yes, sir.

I have not tried the .03 but the .02 gave some really nice proffits, where the .04 so far just keeping me flat

--- 帖子 #775 ---
i will start fresh today, with correct settings on 17 est and see how its going to work.

P.S. And i am a girl, so, please, reffer to me as "she"

Piphunter............how long has the IBFX demo been running? am looking at it and am trying to look at the performance but for what period has it been there?

thanks

--- 帖子 #777 ---
i have the same problem that drinka had. There is 6 longs in USDCHF and 6 longs in USDJPY. And the most intersting is that in USDJPY each set have difereents profits/losses.

i am using the ibfx version. I was using risk 0.01 but with a $33 mini demo account. Maybe this is the problem with double ordes. I will try using it correct now.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Are you two using different magic numbers for each EA?

--- 帖子 #779 ---
>>What time frame do you use the EA on? I have mine set to 1 hour? I have the EUR/JPY, GBP/USD and the USD/JPY on it. Is this correct?<<

1HR Chart, yes.

>>Can I use more pairs, will it work with other pairs?<<

Everyone is testing that now.

>>Also , my platform is on gmt time +2. Do I put 22 for the time start or still stick with 0?Thank you, Paris[/quote]<<

I'm a little foggy on this myself, maybe someone else can answer it for you.

Hey Gang,

I am new to this thread and see great potential with this trading system.  I have Interbankfx as my broker and am curious as to which ea version would be best to download to my mt4 platform.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
The Interbank FX version.

Here are the IBFX results for today:

EUR/USD = SellStops Activated

Order #1 = -30 Pips

Order #2 = -30 Pips

Order #3 = -30 Pips

USD/JPY = BuyStops Activated

Order #1 = +15 Pips

Order #2 = +30 Pips

Order #3 = Broke Even

EUR/JPY = BuyStops Activated

Order #1 = +15 Pips

Order #2 = +30 Pips

Order #3 = Broke Even

Total: + 0 Pips / -$11.89  (Good Note For Everyone - You Can Break Even On Pips and still lose money due to the difference in Pip Values!)

Total For Week: +215 Pips / +$179.03

Please Note that I run the expert with set lots of .10 on a standard account with no trailing stop for test purposes. I also run a separate expert for each pair with the EAMagicNo changed for each pair. This is just my way of doing it. It is a very complicated expert and some have stated that it is not opening the correct amount of pending orders while using the same expert on all pairs at the same time.

Your setting should be 23 for the DayStartHour.

OK Everyone,

Lets just get this out there because on Monday I know there are going to be a flood of posts regarding the time change issue. There are a lot of people spending a great amount of time and computer resources to test this EA, but it is all for nothing if we are not all on the same time settings. So here is my solution:

I need everyone to find out from there broker what time their severs are going to be on after the time change. Most of them will stay on the same time - GMT, GMT+2, GMT-2, etc.

PM me with the broker name, server time (in respect to GMT), and what time (with respect to GMT) they start the first candle (bar) on Sunday/Monday. After I have this information I am going to post a version of the EA for Each Individual Broker. I feel by doing this we will be able to get everyone on the same page.

As you know I already have IBFX covered so there is no need to send me that information.

Have a PipFull Day!

--- 帖子 #786 ---
yes. Different.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
The following is the order information for IBFX @ 17:00 EST Thursday (21:00 GMT)

EUR/USD

BuyStop = 1.4485

SellStop = 1.4399

USD/JPY

BuyStop = 115.99

SellStop = 114.42

EUR/JPY

BuyStop = 167.31

SellStop = 164.88

Pips To All!

--- 帖子 #788 ---
When will you post it?

and i have one more question for you. I am testing Fozzy EA and Daily Scalp ea 1h. Do you know if is needed modifications in thoese EAs too? Fozzy has the option "Use GMT 00" wich is true by now. It is correct? I need to change it (i am aways using Interbank)?

Daily Scalp has "gmt shift" (0), "hourToClose" (17) and "sundayCandleExistts"

(true)

need any changes too?

thanks and sorry for my english, hope you undesrtand.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
He's going to post the new EAs this weekend.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
giraia_br,

I have no idea about these other EAs, their settings, or what they do. I am currently devoting all my time to this system, it's EA and this thread. I am sorry that I could not be of more help.

For everyone, please be advised that I already have the information for Alpari and Interbankfx in regards to the new time setting issues, so you will not need to PM me on these.

Have a Pipfull Day!

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Yes, the time change will produce a few interesting days of adjustment.

I've already adjusted the DayStartHour on my North Finance and ODL demo's to 23 and 21 respectively in order to have orders calculated at

5pm EST (I think that's correct), and expect to change again on Monday.

I figure that come Monday, even if some of us have the EA placing orders at different times there's no cause for alarm as it's hard to say which scenario will be more profitable.

That being said, it will definitely be less confusing with everyone trading the same time setting.

Good work PipHunter for organising the team.

if you can survive a drawdown of 1300 pips, Hans123 system is a great profitable system.

I have been a fan of hans system for 2 years and still. In 2006 it was easy winner, I think its results were 2600 pips up, drawdown 1100 pips. In 2007 it was not easy, but still a winner of 1200 pips or so.

In my opnion, to trade hans123, you need strong nerves.

Hi,

I'm new to MT4 and EA.

I'm trying to understand how to use the strategy tester through my IBFX demo account.

I download the file :

* Daily95pips strategy - IBFX Changes Made By PipHunter196

* http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=44246

* Created by Pr1mer

I then ran this through the strategy tester for 2007, and am getting back nothing but losses. Based on what I am reading this does not seem correct for this strategy.

Is it obvious to anybody what I am doing wrong ?

And can anybody suggest a site or something where I can learn more about EA's, writing them and using the strategy tester.

Thanks.

Don't become a believer in back testing.  There are many instances of EAs that do good in back testing, but then do poorly in forward testing.   And vice versa.

Also, if you want to learn more about different EAs, and how to code new EAs, go to:

www.forex-tsd.com

Forex Factory also has a section that is good for EA matters as well, it's under Meta Trader 4.

Looking forward to some strong trends to see how the trailing stop works.

EURJPY +45

Date: Wednesday 31 October 2007

EURJPY +94

USDJPY +15

EURUSD +15

Total: +124pips

Comment: The trailing stop on EURJPY happened to lock in +49pips, 1pip lower than if I hadn't used it....we at least have evidence that the TS is working. The EA is working well most of the time, however for this day it didn't calculate the long orders on EURUSD, so I took the paper traded result. I'm still 90% happier with the new EA.

Date: Thursday 1 November 2007

EURJPY +15

USDJPY +45

EURUSD -90

Comment: There was a very large price move to the downside during this session which triggered the short orders. However, price didn't continue enough to reach all profit targets.

Date: Friday 2 November 2007

EURJPY nt

USDJPY -90

EURUSD -90

Hi everyone,

I want to thanks Mikelath for sharing this excellent strategy, Pr1mer for his great coding work, and to the big organizer PipHunter, Excellent work!! I ‘ve been following this thread almost since the beginning and let me tell you that it’s one

of the best threads. I hope in the future I can help, thx….

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Haha, well it looks like one of my MT4 Demo's got closed on one of my computers and it happened to be this forward test.  So I missed Thursday and Fridays move and only hit the positive days this week.  Not great for forward testing, but there are worse fates.

Here's a link to my the statement for this EA.  Warning, Metatrader posts it on my personal FTP, which goes down sometimes when I post it here just from the traffic.

How's the FTP server coming Piphunter?  PM if you have anymore questions.

Hi !!!

For the moment you can´t work with the EA´s on FXCM. Maybe in some mounths. But you can use the Order2Go Api of FXCM, to program in Visual Basic or Java...Is very easy for this system, but not for others.

You can read more here...

http://www.fxprogrammers.com/

This is my Beta EA  for FXCM Trading Station II...Is a modification of the original "Junior_TS". For the moment you have to set the HIGH and LOW manually, but I m working in a Access Database for do that. No problem with delete the limitis, change the Stop and Trailing Stop.

Saludos !!!!

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Thanks PipHunter.

How do you backtest your strategies then ?

At the moment I am doing this visually which is time consuming and mind numbing. And then makes matters worse half way through I wonder what impact a small tweak would make on the results and have to begin the whole process again. Which just adds to the whole mind numbing experience.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Thanks Yoda Glenn,

Why does the back testing and forward testing give conflicting resluls?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Because Past Performance is No Guarantee of Future Results.  There are too many unpredictable variables in future price action.  Price action is ruled by current fundamentals and surprise news events, and not what happened in 1985.

Yoda_Glenn,

Thanks for your help! I downloaded the ibfx version to my interbank platform but have hit a snag. I saved the files to my experts indicators file but when I open it the journal in the platform says "expert daily 95 pips ibfx version is not custom indicator and will be removed". Needless to say the program doesn't load and isn't working. I'm not sure what I've done wrong. So if you or anyone can help me it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Put the file in the experts root directory, and NOT the indicator directory that is within the experts directory.

In other words:

Save to:

Interbank FX Trader 4/Experts

Do not save to:

Interbank FX Trader 4/Experts/Indicators

Also, wait for PipHunter's latest EA version for IBFX users.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
I'll wait for the updated version, load it and see what happens. Thanks again for your help!

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Hello Everyone,

In this post, and the following, you will find the EAs that I have changed to work with the following brokers:

IBFX (InterbankFx)
Alpari
FXDD
North Finance
ODL

These need to be loaded on your platform and activated PRIOR to the start of trading Sunday, or whenever the first 1H bar for your broker is formed for the week. This EA is setup to work on a 1H chart. If you attach it to any other time frame, it will not trade according to the rules set forth by Mikelath.

Each EA has been modified to the time changes for each broker that I have listed above. They also take into account if the broker has missing bars from their close on Friday and their open on Sunday.

Pr1mer wrote this EA and deserves the credit for doing so. I am just trying to help with the time issues and, thus, I have made a couple small programming changes. His instructions on how to set up the other parameters are HERE.

If we can get everyone on the same time schedule, we can start checking other aspects of this EA. If there are any changes that need to be made after we start using the Fall Versions of the EA I will let you all know.

Have A PipFull Day!

I want to thank everyone who has worked so hard on this trading system especially Mikelath,Pr1mer and Piphunter196. I also want to thank Yoda_Glenn for helping me with my questions. Some of the answers to my questions may seem obvious but since I'm a newbie I am still learning. With that being said I have downloaded the new ea ibfx version to my experts file and reopened my platform and nothing happens. So my question is what do I need to do next to get this ea to work?

Greetings,

I am new to this thread. I have the following questions:

My demo platform is FXDD, therefore I am using the EA for FXDD (fall version).

I understood that we are supposed to use 5 PM EST for the DayStart Parameter is that correct?

Therefore, if my demo broker's time equates to 23:00 for 5 pm my time (which is EST), then is 23 entered for the parameter DayStart?

In addition, what time would be entered for the LookBackHours based on the above information?

Regards and thanks,

Sam

I'm an IB for them.  They promised MT4 within "90 days" back in January of this year.

Talking to them last week, I've heard we should hear something new this week.  If past performance is any clue, however, don't hold your breath.  If it happens it happens.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hola everyone.

Ok i have been missing in action here for the past couple of days (National Independence Days) and just need to ask three quickies about the new EA Pip Hunter has worked on.

1) What the hell is a Fall Version - Do you mean Full Version

2) If I did not start with the new Fall (Full) Version on Sunday Night do i have to wait until Sunday next week to attach it to my charts or just load it up hold my breath and hope for the best. And do I have to add the MQ4 file to the Experts folder or simply the EA .exe file.

3) I guess with the new EA I don't have to worry about time settings that PIP Hunter indicated to me was incorrect in my ODL Account.

Thanks

Reddragon

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Sam,

You do not need to change the time hour setting for the fall version. It is already done. That is why I made different versions of the EA with the times already taken care of. Just leave the setting as is.

Have A PipFull Day!

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Reddragon,

The FALL version is as it indicates - FOR THE TIME CHANGE IN THE FALL - I will make the next versions the SPRING version. This way everyone can keep them seperated.

You can load the EA at any time. The only reason it is critical to loading on Sunday is if it is not loaded within one hour of your broker starting you will not get your Monday Trades.

I do not know if all the EA versions are putting the orders in at the right time or not. I have not gotten any messages otherwise yet.

Hope This Helps!

Have A PipFull Day!

it was one of the first pairs tested, i think the volatile nature of GJ caused it to crash and burn,  when looking for new way to trade, always read the first page, most threads update page 1 when things change.

IF YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED ONE OF THE VERSIONS OF 95 DAILY PIPS THAT I HAVE POSTED PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE FOLLOWING SETTINGS ARE IN THE DayStartHour (THE NUMBER LISTED IN BLUE IS 17:00 EST FOR THAT BROKER)

FXDD = 0
NORTH FINANCE = 0
ALPARI = 23
ODL = 22
IBFX = 22

I have downloaded a version of the platform for each of the brokers listed above and found that some of the information that I received, and thus based the changes to the Fall Versions of the EA, were incorrect. I think that the only one that has a daystarthour problem is ODL, but I am not sure so I am posting them all.

I am sorry for any inconvenience and will let you know if there are any other changes that will be made.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Ok, so trying to change to 00 in FXDD and it reverts back to 0?

Thanks,

First post or first page ....where did that statement come from?

1.) At 5pm EST open the 1hr chart (2hrs b4 start of the Asian session) of USDJPY. ( In an attempt to pre-empt questions about how this strategy works on other pairs, I will post results comparing GBPUSD, GBPJPY, EURJPY, and EURUSD. You're welcome to add to the list.)

Hola everyone

OK PIP HUNTER you got me mate. We have wet or dry not Fall and Spring but i get the drift. And also i guess its the broker time start for the day not where you live, as we don't have Day Light Saving here in Panama (Fools)

I'm not trying to be negative, or anything, but I'm skeptical this EA can work in the long run.  The reason being because this EA's losses are HUGE compared to its gains.  This EA seems to be averaging wins that are either at 15 pips or 45 pips at best.  And now, with the declining value of the $, breaking even is often coming in at a loss, on some pairs.  Maybe consider widening the stop loss and turning off the "break even setting," those could be some possible solutions.  Unfortunately, my computer resources are a bit tied up, so I wont be able to test this myself

--- 帖子 #851 ---
PIP HUNTER update, i changed the settings as suggested including the last update you posted. At 22 hours nothing happened at all, at 15 mins before Tokyo opening i reverted to 0 hours, and the orders dropped in again. I am on ODL, and perhaps there are some troubles with them as you mentions. Do you or others know of a broker that also offers 100K demo and gold oil and silver trading as well because they are important to the currencies we are trading. Suggest me please.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
I got the same result in EJ pairs. But I started to test GBP/JPY with 50 SL, 3 target profit :25,50,80 on the same day. I set 25 trail stop. The price reach to target1 and then retrace back to -20, target 2 and target 3 finally ended at 0 profit after the price reach to 45 profit and retrace back.

I will wait a week or two before reverting back to the set 50PT.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
I'm assuming that you meant USDJPD in your result. By the way, what was your trade sellstop and buystop set at? I used PipHunter's numbers and so far the EURJPD and the USDJPD haven't been touched.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
ooops...thanks for pointing out my typo hansel.

I can't remember the entry levels for those trades....however, remember that depending on the broker you're using and the fact that the DayStartHour settings on the EA for each broker may still not be in sync amongst us all, it's likely that entry levels will vary.

hi thanx for sharing your system i am new in this method should i read just post 1 of this thread for all rules of this trading method or you changed some?

and do you have any bak test and also forward test of this system ? and how many green pips averagely can we get in a month? and how many green pips did you get during you opened this thread till now?   and how should i start this trading style?

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Hi fxramin.

The rules are still pretty much as per post #1. I've tried to keep post #1 updated with any changes....

I have only done forward testing of this strategy...you can check the results at post #804.

The average pips per month so far is approx +840.

Now that a good EA has been created courtesy of Pr1mer, the best way to start trading this style is to open a demo account with an MT4 broker, install the Expert Advisor and sit back and watch.

Greetings,

I opened a FXDD demo yesterday. Using the FXDD EA with no changes to set file, I had the following results:

USD/CAD +15, +30, +50 = +95

AUD/USD 0

NZD/USD +15= +15

What I noticed, however, is retracements on the above caused the 0 breakeven to occur.

I have two questions:

In reading the post that has the settings - I did not understand if there is a way to capture say, 10 pips on a retracement?

When dealing with a ranging market, what are the system results (for example, through July and August of this year)? Can we expect weeks where this system has DD? I don't mean necessarily with this EA, just manually placing the trades?

Thanks,

Sam

Here are the IBFX results for today:

EUR/USD = BuyStops Activated

Order #1 = +15 Pips

Order #2 = +30 Pips

Order #3 = +50 Pips

USD/JPY = No Trades Activated

EUR/JPY = BuyStops Activated

Order #1 = +15 Pips

Order #2 = Break Even

Order #3 = Break Even

Total: +110 Pips / +$108.08

Week Total: -70 Pips / -$49.15

Please Note that I run the expert with set lots of .10 on a standard account with no trailing stop for test purposes. I also run a separate expert for each pair with the EAMagicNo changed for each pair. This is just my way of doing it. It is a very complicated expert and some have stated that it is not opening the correct amount of pending orders while using the same expert on all pairs at the same time.

"UpdateToBE - number of pips in profit, when stoploss is moved to break-even point, e.g. when set to 15 - stop loss will be moved to opening price after reaching 15 pips profit. If you want to move SL to b/e when first take profit is taken, set to the same value as TakeProfit1 setting. The same goes for TP2, TP3." - Pr1mer

Maybe you should try to increase the UpdateToBE by another 10 or 20 pips.

Ok, I see. I needed the shortned and abbreviated version.

Though I welcome additional strategy thinking.  One of the more exciting features of this system is the greater than 1:1 Risk/Reward ratio each day on a set and forget methodology.  Total pips risked 90 best total gain 95.

The strategy you have posted has a less than 1:1 ratio.  Risking 75 and gaining 70.  This means you need a greater than 50% win rate just to break even.  Be careful there.

I'm now using 30 as the setting for UpdateToBE to give the 2nd and 3rd orders more room to move.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Greetings folks.

Though I'm officially only posting results for the shortlisted pairs EJ, UJ and EU I'm simultaneously using the EA on other pairs as well.

Just to give you an idea of what happened today, the following results are from using the EA in an ODL demo account:

USDCHF +95

AUDUSD +95

GBPUSD +45 (3rd order still open)

EURJPY +95

USDJPY -90

EURUSD +95

Total: +335pips

Considering that the EA makes the whole process much easier I will now be more open to trading more pairs.

AUDUSD looks like it could be a good one. USDCHF is an opposite correlative pair to EURUSD so has potential too.

mike

--- 帖子 #871 ---
You got the point. I found that there will be a slight retrace back after the price hit 30TP, most of time this retracement will hit the SL of target3 if I use trail stop to move the SL to BE. So the total profit for a day is 45 pips. I would like to see the profit can reach to 70 if I use 15,25,30 TP without having to wait for the original 50.

Hello guys,

Please I am a novice to EAs. When attaching the EA to MT4, is it the two files I would attach? ie .mg4 and .ex4 files?

I was able to attach the .mg4 file and got a smiling face but was wondering what to do with the .ex4 file.

Please excuse my ignorance.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Hello!

You can use either mq4 or exe version of the EA. .exe files are just compiled of mq4. So if you have smiling face on the chart - it shoud be working.

Regards.

I was executed on EURJPY in both directions. Is it OK, or should I remove short orders after long execution?

Hi,

Execution in both direction will cancel each other out, except for broker fees (spread), which are two-fold...till one is stopped out first.

Dump the position & wait for another go-round.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Ok...I hit all the TP that were in my EA on the GJ just now... but i left many pips on the table because I did not have a Trailing stop.  I know that sometimes a trailer is a bad thing because it may stop me when it retraces but if you could put a 50 pip trailer I think that may work.

So on the EA how would you change it so that the 3rd position could have a trailer?

I love it so far... thanks for creating it

As most of you have found out today, the EA has a problem with getting the orders in when the price is so close to the stop and the market is moving quickly at 17:00. This is a problem that will need to be investigated. I will keep you all up to date if I can find out more information.

I do not believe it is a EA programming problem, but we may need to add some program contexts for this situation.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #886 ---
I have 4 pairs that I use with the EA. However most of the time only 2 pair will load and the other 1 or 2 won't load at all. I use the GBP/USD, the USD/JPY the AUD/USD and the EUR/JPY but most of the time only 2 pairs out of 4 will actually load with the EA. I don't mean they won't trigger any trades, I mean they won't load at all some days! Is this a bug in the EA? Thanks, Paris

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Do you still use the EA When big news announcements are on the horizon...such as NFP?? Or do you sit on the sideline that day. I guess the question is valid for both the EA or Manually using the system.

The EA worked great for me yesterday... first time using it on a demo account with FXDD.

One more question can I set the Lot size and / or Risk amount?

Thanks again to all for all your hard work on the EA (PIPHUNTER196) and for the system (MIKELATH). this really fits how I like to trade.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Hello rswamy4449,

The reason that some orders are canceled is because when the stops in one direction are triggered, the stops in the other direction are canceled. Example, if the BuyStop Pending Orders are triggered, The SellStop Pending orders will be canceled (or deleted).

Hope this helps!

Have a Pipfull Day!

Hi Folks!

I have been a lurker on this thread for some time.  I have been testing a similar breakout system for some time now.

I got 3 private messages for the EA's I'm using. I can't reply because I have less than 15 posts. So I'll post here. All the EA's I've been running I've only started testing Nov. 2nd so it's too early to tell yet if they'll be successful. I'll see where everything stands at the end of November. I made +705 pips on my home computer and exactly +400 pips at my work computer since I've started using the 3 eas since November 2nd. The settings are the same but I'm using different brokers. The one at home is North Finance and the one at work is FXDD. So far it looks real good. The EA's don't over trade and it's really easy to stay on top of it. I'll keep everyone updated.

Some of you may be wondering why I got +407pips on Friday and you didn't....

After repeated experiences of having the 2nd and 3rd orders being stopped out after the EA moved the SL to BE once the 1st profit target was reached I decided to change the UpdatetoBE setting from 15 to 30, meaning that the EA now moves the stoploss to breakeven only after the 2nd profit target of 30pips is reached.

This has worked well so far, however be aware that it also exposes the trades to more potential loss ie. once the 15PT is reached and price retraces to the -30SL the result will be -45pips instead of locking +15pips if the SL had been moved to BE after the 1st PT was reached. The upside of course is that the 2nd and 3rd orders now have more room to move in achieving their profits which is what happened on Friday.

I'm also using the trailing stop feature on the 3rd order.

Tweaking of this system continues and I'm still over the moon about Pr1mer creating such a great EA !

Hi tuttler.

I've been using the EA from this thread on GBPJPY only for the past 3 days and it has brought +150pips so far. It uses a 100PT and 50SL and seems to be a reliable and efficient EA.

Good Morning Tmac,

This is just my way of testing EAs. I have found, in the past, that sometimes having the same magic number, even if it is on different pairs, will cause trades to be closed or not executed. As I said, this is just my way of doing it.

Have a PipFull Day!

--- 帖子 #910 ---
sorry but I will keep this on topic

--- 帖子 #911 ---
I'll try both ways and see what happens

BTW you might want to look at the other thread and see if you can work some of your magic to that one as well.

something else you might consider is having your paypal info come up in the top left of the screen in the EA chart for those that would like to donate to help pay for your time

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Thanks for the contributions everybody -

First off - PipHunter - I also am running Interbank and my results have been exactly matching yours.  I think that says something for the stability of the EA.  Within the next few days, I hope to go live using a .01 lot order size.  I think I can afford $9.00 per day.

Mike - your daily results probably go back farther than anybody else's.  Do you have a breakdown as per the day of the week or a way you could easily compute it?  I am curious to know if for example, Tuesdays are more profitable than Fridays.  Maybe there is a trend there we should be paying attention to.

I also wanted to make sure and point out the obvious  - just in case.  Even the best systems will have their draw downs.  Responsible money management is the difference between investing and gambling.  Without a  plan in place, the market will get you.  It may not be today or tomorrow, but it will happen.

Thanks again everyone.

Tim

What time does the EA (IBFX) put in the order in EST . THanks.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Hi Tim.

I'm not really inclined to do a backtest in order to determine which days of the week have performed better than others, as this average could just as easily change again as further forward testing is done. If you'd like to do this exercise then be my guest as all the daily and weekly results are on this thread to help you with the calculations. Have fun.:

So far I've found that good results can come on any day, therefore I leave the potential for profits open for the full 5 days, Mon-Fri.

Regarding the worst possible scenario for the day, well it happened today with EJ, UJ and EU all stopping out for a total loss of -270pips. I think this is the first day it's happened. The worst possible scenario on a longer timeframe would be if this repeated everyday until my trading account is blown.

So yes, this is also possible though not very likely. The best MM pertaining to this strategy is the use of multiple profit targets, moving the stoploss to BE after the 1st or 2nd PT is reached and using a TS on the 3rd order.

If you can think of anyway to improve upon this MM system I'm sure we'd all appreciate you sharing it.

Having said all that, I'll keep praying for success.

cheers

mike

Thanks mikelath for posting this strategy. Thanks primer for the brilliant ea. Thanks all the other contributors for your contributions to this thread. I have read the first 20 pages and last 10, and will catch up on the pages in between now that FF is back on line.

I have already done my first +203, within three-and-a-half hours of the ea setting the first orders. Fantastic. I know there will be losing days, but the results you have all been getting speak for themselves.

This is my 10th month of surviving, just, in Forex. I have made and lost money, mostly lost. I have been learning and gradually become aware of the importance of Fibonacci support and resistance points. I am a looooonnnnnnng way from expertise, so I make this contribution with due deference to more experienced traders.

I used Fib s\r to adjust the EU third order tp. The attached image shows the tp as set by the ea to slightly below -61.8, a major support. There is every chance that a price will rebound from this, so I set my own tp a couple of pips higher. As things turned out, the price broke the barrier so I lost a couple of pips; another day I might have saved myself some profit.

I also checked that the stop losses were not affected. For example, a sl on a sell just below a resistance point could save the trade if moved beyond that point. The negative is that I could lose a few more pips if the price continued rising, but the image is a great example of s\r at work.

After the thick red candle, there is a faint, hard-to-see thin green candle where the price spent an hour bouncing between -23.6 and -50 before finally making up its mind and falling later on. You will need to enlarge the image to see the candle.

I offer these thoughts as a possible refinement for those able to monitor the positions once the ea has opened them. I have attached a great Fib indicator, courtesy of Spud, which shows the s\r points in detail. It is worth  changing the colours to white to make it more legible.

Good luck everybody. I am putting the ea on my live account in time for tomorrow, so expect the strategy to begin failing instantly.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Thanks for great suggestions SteveHopwood!

Adjusting levels of stop-losses and take-profits is the greatest issue with this EA. So far people here use mostly fixed values, but I think that at least different values for different pairs based on their volatility should be used. There were alse some attempts from bkjusal to use ATR.

I really like your idea of using Fibs (I'm a fan of them too ). Do you compute them just between day's high and low?

Tell me about your tests using this modification, I might incorporate it into the next verion of EA if it's successful.

Be warned that the current version of EA shouldn't used with live accounts, it's still not reliable enough. However, if you decide to use it anyway, at least do more demo testing to be comfortable with it.

I will keep posting the results. I just drag Spud's Fibo onto the chart each day as I am not sure if it redraws itself automatically. I have attached the source code in case you are interested.

Thanks Primer. I hadn't realised that - better read the pages I have missed. I will only use tiny lot sizes; as someone else here said, I can stand $9.

How come our results are so different? Mine are:

UJ +15 (15, 0, 0)

EU +93 (15, 30, 48)

EJ +95

Strange.

Here are my results for this first day of trading this week and they seem to be very different indeed to some of the other brokers.

EU/JP+  119

US/JP+   45

AU/US+  97

GP/US+  15

EU/US-  90

AU/JP+  15

TOTAL PIP GAINS 201 FOR THE NIGHT

SINCE OCT 25 AUD USD PIP GAIN IS 461 PIPS NOT A SINGLE LOSING DAY THAT I HAVE APPLIED THE EA TO THE CHART.

HAPPY PIPING EVERYONE

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Lucky you Steve.

I'm not sure why our results varied so much....today the EA didn't calculate the short orders in my North Finance demo account, so I've taken the results from an IBFX demo. I'm waiting to see if PipHunter got the same...in any case, such occurances are usually the result of different time settings and slight variations in the price offered by different brokers.

So, well done on a great result for the day.

Tweaking of this system is something that is certainly not being ruled out and your suggestions are highly valued. Pr1mer has already inquired about optimal settings for each individual pair...I'm personally not really up to speed with ATR, Fibonacci, S/R (though I probably should be)....however, if these tools can be incorporated into the D95P EA for maximised results then I'm all for it.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Just a thought, would the EA be using the last days results?  if so each broker has a different time for closing on Friday and opening on Monday and some will include the weekend info.

most likely tuesday's results will be much closer.

just a though, but loving the work you guys are doing.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
I don't have an answer, yet - but it looks like the market filling in the gaps got me anyway.  I hope I am not boring you, but let me take a second to explain why this is a problem

When the market closes on Friday and then reopens on Sunday, it often opens at a price different than it closed.  This 'gap' can be anywhere from a few to a lot of pips.  If the market closed anywhere near the low or high from the previous day, the pending orders would be filled.  The problem is that the market tends to reverse and fill in these gaps, often times to just to reverse again and move back the original direction.   I even think there is a thread talking about how to trade these gaps

If your settings are as mine, the EA opened and filled orders based on the gaps, then hits the stop loss as the market reverses and fills in the gaps.

When I have some time, I am going to go back and see how often this has been occuring.  The only answer I can think of right now is to turn off the EA and skip using it on the first day of the week.

Any other thoughts?

Tim

In reply to icfxtrader

Sorry mate can not PM you back yet have not got the number of posts so working on it. OK , yes the ODL results are very different I am also running an IBFX account to simply see the difference here between two leading brokers.

In reply to your questions  I noticed you are using ODL. Can you tell me according to their server time the start and finish candle time to use for Mike's method?

REPLY

Would not have a clue. Truly I have used several of the edited EA’s and set them up and got no trades at all coming online or some did and then the stop loss did not move up to enter price etc. I originally set up the EA and never changed anything and was working ok on some charts. Then I added the edited versions and had no hope of working out time differences, Then I re downloaded the original EA from Pr1mer. Then went in set it up again to 0 hours, the orders fell in, at 7 PM Panama Time. Then I changed late last week to 20 hours and they came in at 4pm and not one of those orders where put into trade over the next 18 hours they expired, yet on demo IBFX Account they feel in at 5 PM Panama Time, So last night 15 mins before 4 PM Panama Time I changed it to 22 Hours and the orders appeared at 6 PM Panama Time. The IBFX Orders came in online at 5 PM Panama Time. See the results of my ODL v IBFX and it’s all over red rover. If you would like me to give you an explanation of this you’re out of luck I got no idea. Sorry. Therefore I have set the most optimum time for the start hour at 22:00

Here are the results

ODL 119 PIPS profit with trailing stop loss picking up 74 PIPS

IBFX 15 PIPS profit. Stopped out on the remaining two orders.

Price difference was large.

ODL  opening price was 161.67 for sell orders (At 6pm Panama Time)

IBFX opening price was 164.44 for sell orders (AT 5pm Panama Time)

Are you using the 1 hour chart for all the pairs?

YES

Are you using the EA?

YES

Do you use a trailing stop or just the take profit and stop loss only?

YES I USE THE TRAILING STOP LOSS

Thanks

Reddragon-

Just to confirm- are you using the "ODL fall version" of the EA for your results posted? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #929 ---
There was a great example of the gap when GU kicked off last night (IBFX live account). EU also had a gap, so my EU trades might simply have been a lucky fluke.

Experienced and successful traders have advised me not to trade when the markets first open up for the week. I like Fibo retrace trading, so I make no attempt to trade for at least 12 hours. It could well be that the ea needs turning off for Monday trading, although it would be interesting to leave it trading the demo to see what happens.

Thanks for your explanation, Tim. It may be old hat to many, but to comparative newbies like me, info like this is invaluable.

Hi All,

I ran into this thread during my travels. I am usually a MANUAL type trader and decided to try this EA out on a MT4 platform from Alpari. I have the Alpari version and have it installed and the EA turned on for Live Trading.

My Question: Currently, the U/Y pair broke +5pip line on a BUY but the EA is yet to fire off. Does the EA have to be turned on prior to the 2300 hr time period?

Any ideas what I am doing wrong.

Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
I feel a bit ridiculous asking this question, but after reading this entire thread I am simply confused on how to work this simple looking strategy. I use FXCM as my broker so no EA for me.

Can someone be so kind as to post a quick overview including the exact time the trades should be loaded, and where exactly to find the high and low data?  I have seen a few contradicting posts on this. Post #1 says to check the H/L´s for the past 17 hours, does that mean the H/L for exactly 17 hours ago at 5 PM EST o the highest high and lowest low within the past 17 hours regardless of where it occurred?

I would greatly appreciate it if someone could post their trades for today in plain text form here so I could once and for all get an understanding for this strategy.

Thanks

Hi bjk2801.

I've just clicked on the paperclick then the EA file for download and it seems to be working fine on my computer....I'm not sure what the problem is that you are encountering...does anyone else have any idea ?

mike

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Hi MG and welcome to the D95P thread.

The EA is mostly working well, however sometimes not when price is making either higher highs or lowers lows at the time of the EA calculating the orders for the day (5pm EST).

I'm eagerly awaiting improvement on this from our trusted Pr1mer who created the EA.

To my knowledge the EA must be turned on prior to the time it is due to calculate the orders for the day. This will depend on the DayStartHour input setting on the EA.

When you click on the download, you want to 'save' it to the Experts folder. You don't want to open the file.

That's the only thing I can think of that may be happening.

Hi Kevin.

If you are manually trading this strategy you may find using the calculator at post#863 helpful.

At 5pm EST simply look back at the previous 17hrs and take the highest point that price has reached and the lowest as well. Input these figures into the calculator which will do all the calculations for you and then simply place the orders with your broker.

I hope this simplifies the process for you.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Thanks Mike...

Can you take a look at my orders above and see if my prices match yours...

Also what is the optimal time to submit these trades? Anytime between 5 and 7 PM EST? Or closer to 5 or closer to 7?

Thanks again

-Kevin

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Yes, that looks about right...now simply enter these figures into the calculator and you're well on your way.

I'm not sure about the optimal time to enter the orders....this topic has come up previously in the thread....if you'd like to try entering the orders at another time of the day you can....I'm of the opinion that regularity with whatever approach you choose is important to keep your own sanity intact....I'm actually using the EA to test entry after the London open and will compare that with entry at 5pm EST.

mike

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Thanks....

Just needed confirmation that I wasn´t making this great system more complicated than needed.

-Kevin

--- 帖子 #948 ---
Exactly. You look for high and low from the midnight to 5pm CET. (5:00pm - 17 = 0:00)

Then :

BUY pending order: HIGH + 5 pips + spread

SELL pending  order: LOW - 5pips

You have to add spread to your high calculation if you use ask price. If you dont apply the spread to the calculation your buy order will be lower (depends on spread) and executed sooner. If you use the calculator, apply "BID" price or "ASK + spread" price for correct calculation of your buy order.

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Another thing about FXCM is I cannot risk less than 1 standard lot per trade, so I need to put up 3 lots per long and 3 per short. 6K per trade.

What are the most profitable pairs to date?

EURJPY is the most profitable pair. Check post#896.

--- 帖子 #951 ---
First of all - THANKS, Mike for posting what seems to be a great system.  I have been using it for a couple of days and really like the idea of "set and forget."  That takes the emotions out of the game.

1.  For order entry's isn't taking the daily high and low at 5pm EST the same as going thru the 1 hr bar and looking back 17 hrs?  Am I missing something?

2.  Mike - do you add the spread on top of the Long (Ask) for your orders?  Your Excel spread sheet only adds the 5 pips?

3.  Do you get out of your current orders every day by 5pm? (even if profitable trade is triggered?)

Thanks, a lot.

Happy Pipping!!!

I set the ea on my live account - IBFX. I set it to enter the orders at 0800 London time to coincide with the opening of the London markets, on eu, uj and ej. Other settings I left at default. I did the same on my demo.

uj and ej +190 (eu no hit). Combined with 3 +5 using fibo retraces to scalp gu after it broke out of an ascending triangle pattern on the chart, my account is up just over 5% today. Here in the UK, we have to leave funds on deposit for a year to make that kind of return.

Of course, I shall probably lose it all again tomorrow. For now, I am cheering.

The ea has behaved perfectly. I have manually deleted the pending eu orders from my live account and am waiting to see if the ea deletes them from the demo at 2.00am.

This gives +303 on my demo (yesterday) and live (today) accounts. Nice strategy, Mike.

1. Correct. No you are not missing anything.

2. No, I don't bother adding the spread. You can if you want to.

3. Yes, all open orders are closed at 5pm EST to make way for the new orders of the day. The EA does this automatically.

mike

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Well done.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
I should have left those eu trades open on my live account. They triggered on the demo and have made +45 now, with the third order still in place. The ea hasn't closed it; it should be placing my new trades in about 40 minutes, at 8.00 am London time.

I have been thinking about the losing trades - not that I have any yet.

From what I have learned, accepted wisdom is: 1) trading against the long-term trend is financial suicide; 2) the long-term trend is found by looking two time frames further on in the charts.

I have looked at the daily charts for eu (screaming upwards), uj (up but with a strong retrace) and uj (gone to hell in a handbasket). Mike, or any of the others who have been trading this system for a while, have you any idea how many of your losing trades were taken out in the opposite direction to the prevailing trend?

Fibonacci support and resistance could well be playing a part. For those of you unfamiliar with Fib s&r, it works like this. Suppose a pair is trending upwards like the eu. Eventually, it hits a Fib resistance point that traders regard as an important barrier to further progress, so they close their orders and take their profits. This causes the price to fall until it hits a certain point that traders (often the very ones who closed in the first place) consider will signal a return to the upward momentum; they will then go long again. Fib s&r points thus become self-fulfilling prophesies.

We can play with these points. There is a Fib retracement tool on the MT4 platform; look for the icon with 4 rows of dots and an F in the bottom right corner. Go to, say, the eu chart on any timeframe and look anywhere for a place where the upward movement of the last few weeks is interrupted by a downward movement. Click on the Fib icon, then on the chart at the bottom of the upward movement and drag to the top of it. You will see the Fib retrace points plotted on the chart. If you haven't done this before, you will be interested in the way certain points trigger counter-movement time and time again.

I like trading the 30 min chart for 20-30 pips; Fib 61.8 seems most important here. I love scalping for +5 on the 5 min chart, where Fib 100 is most important; once the price breaks this then making +5 is easy.

I don't know what the crucial point is on our 1H tf, but it will be one of the smaller ones; 38.2 or 23.6 are my guesses, as we are dealing with a longer time frame.

All this could affect this tradingsystem thus: a strong price retrace triggers the pending order; the retrace is at its apex, and so the price reverses back in the direction of the trend. Hey-presto, -90.

All my winning trades have been taken in the direction of the prevailing daily trend apart from the uj yesterday. Do a retrace thing on the daily, dragging from top to bottom of the previous downward movement, and you will see a retrace almost to the 38.2. I might simply have been lucky yesterday.

All of which is a long-winded way of suggesting that we cancel (ea) or do not set manually, the pending orders that are in the opposite direction to the trend as seen on the Daily chart. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #961 ---
hi all...

i wonder, is there any program or metaquote for MT4 which can cancel one of stop orders we put in? so if we put both pending buy & sell order we won't worry that both will trigerred when we do something elsewhere...

if it is available, please post it in here, i think it will be very useful...

thanks....

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Very interesting stuff Steve.

To answer your question, no I haven't considered the long-term trend, fibonacci or S/R levels. However, their influence on increasing the probability of a trade being a winner or loser cannot be ignored.

I'd like to suggest that you contact Pr1mer who has created the EA for this strategy and discuss the feasability of adding such criteria to the EA.

Thanks for the contribution.

Hi GaPs.

If you are referring to having the short orders cancelled when the long orders are triggered and visa versa then this 'one cancels other' function is already programmed into the EA which can be downloaded from this thread.

To save the EA to your computer click on the paperclip at the top of the page (scroll back up if you need to). A box will appear with all the attachments added to this thread. 5 attachments down that list is where the EA's begin. There are 2 files for each broker eg. Daily 95 pips (Fall Version) mq4 and ex5.

Let me know if you need further help.

I used it today to keep the uj orders in place. If the upturn in the uj fortunes is the reversal of the recent down trend, then the buy orders will be ok. If it is merely a retrace, then even retracing to 38.2 leaves enough headroom for +15 and breakeven on the others. We shall see; if forex were that predictable, we would all be rich.

I will do that.

eu and ej triggered first, so Iwas up +93 at one point. I knew there ware important usd news releases due at 1.30 gmt, so I should have cancelled the pendings a couple of hours before that.

The news caused a spike that triggered the buys. Breakout quickly turned to fakeout, hence the loss. The trades were even about 8 pips in profit briefly; closing then would have made the difference between a highly profitable and marginally profitable day.

Still, profit is profit.

Hello PipHunter196

Could you make an EA for MIGFX?

Brokers time = GMT +1

Last candle of friday = 22:00 - 22:59 (GMT +1)

First candle of sunday = 23:00 - 23:59 (GMT +1)

Quote:

I'd like to suggest that you contact Pr1mer who has created the EA for this strategy and discuss the feasability of adding such criteria to the EA.

I will do that.

Actually Steve, you may want to contact PipHunter too who has graciously adjusted the EA to suit different brokers. Surely 3 heads will be better than 2...or 1...

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Thanx mike, i've downloaded the programs, so where should i put them? in the folder expert--indicators? both? and how to use it? just click the EA in 1H timeframe? or what? i'm new here...

thanx

I'm helping someone else with the very same question and steps to get their EA going. Please give me your email address since you probably can't PM me and I'll try to help (remember to include your platform name [IBFX, Alpari, FXDD, etc]).

Since Mike, Primer, and PipHunter have done such a wonderful job on this EA, I'd like to contribute by coming up with a quick word document on how to load the EA. I'll keep adding to it.

If anyone else wants it, please PM me, if not give me your email address.

Thanks,

Sam

Hello,

Whatis a magic EA number? Mine says 156909.  What does it mean, is it the WRONG setting? Also, using EA for IBFX, how do you know how much you are "putting on" each trade and can you change that number?  Please forgive my stupidity, I am new to EA's.  Please help!  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
If you have the EA set for a demo account, will it also trigger you live account, or do you have to turn on the live account as well?  Thanks much!

--- 帖子 #972 ---
The EA works on a live account as well, although I would recommend you demo test it first. The EA needs to be attached to each chart as it would if you were using it in a demo account, so you would need to go through the same process on a live account of setting up the EA as on the demo.

Hope that helps explain.

Sam

--- 帖子 #973 ---
As for the Magic EA Number I read that PipHunter changed his numbers for every currency pair chart he is using (I believe) - although he can explain this better. As for changing the Fixed Lot options, right-click on the chart you have loaded the Ea on, then go to Expert, Properties, Inputs and adjust the Fixed lot settings. example FixedLots=0.05

Hope that helps.

Sam

95 pips was amazing today, all EA settings default except for GBPJPY :-

AUDJPY +15 pips
AUDUSD +15 pips
CHFJPY +95 pips
EURJPY +95 pips
EURUSD +45 pips
GBPUSD +15 pips
GBPJPY +225 pips! ( tps set at 50, 75 and 100, BE to 40 , TP = 60)
USDJPY +15 pips

total 460 pips

USDCAD -90 pips
USDCHF -90 pips
AUDCAD -90 pips

Total -270

Grand total =250

I'm deleting the last three pairs and will trade the other for a few weeks until I can prune the currencies back to the best four or five.

Monday I had all trades hitting the SL so I'll stay out of the market Sunday/Monday and set the EAs on Monday evening I think.

Thanks so much to MiekLath and Primer for this excellent system and EA, also to everyone else who's helping to make this system stronger every week

Hey Currymonster-

Can you tell me what time your trades are opening/what broker you're using? I'm trading some of the same pairs you are but achieving much different results (i.e. my trades haven't closed today). What time are trades supposed to open? Mine are opening at 2100. I'm using ODL and the ODL fall version of the EA. Thanks a bunch for any advice/ assistance! Much appreciated!

--- 帖子 #977 ---
I'm on IBFX and trading time is currently set to 22:00,

using the IBFX fall EA,

i am enjoying the work of others in the interbank EA for mt4.

will i enjoy the same results as other profitable users of it if i plug it in and turn it on in the middle of the week?

if not, how can i avoid any issues with time matching up, server times and gmt.  i ask b/c there seems to be alot of conern with that in the scores of pages before this one and the interbank EA has not been profitable for me yet.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
I only started using the ea this week; I have enjoyed fabulous success with it (UBFX Fall version).

I want the orders sending at the start of the London session, so my ea is timed to kick in at 8.00 because I live in the UK. I know that Curreymonster is using the default of 22.00. I don't think that server time matters, although others will correct me if I am wrong.

Hey guys,

I am testing out the North Finance EA Fall version and find that something is not particularly right. The orders that it is placing are not above the day's high or low but looks more like the start hour's high or low.

Can someone confirm this please or did  I probably missed out on my settings?

--- 帖子 #982 ---
I am with you on North Finance. My results are way off a lot of the time. It doesn't give me the confidence to go live with this EA.

Hello room,

Decided to test this strategy after following it for some time. Tested it on the EJ after yesterdays closing. Got all 95pips. Plan to continue to use it and post results. Love the idea of placing order, leaving it, and checking on it the following morning, should be less stressful.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
No trade today. The wretched computer did a Windows Update and rebooted. I was sure I had cancelled auto-update, but clearly not. Hey ho.

I have worked out why my results have been different to Mike's, and why the gap didn't get me on Monday.

IBFX Fall version, I have set to place the pending orders at 8.00am London time, which is 3.00 am EST. I did this to catch the opening of the London market.

It has worked well this week - up +396, of which 193 are live. It is not exactly sticking to a well-tried strategy that has stood up well to the 5.00pm EST. Should I leave things as they are, or change?

What do the troops think?

Steve

I for one am very pragmatic - if it ain't broke - don't fix it.

In stating the obvious, it is the trend reversals that cost pips using this system.  If having the EA initiate the pending orders at the opening of London means fewer revesals during the day, then the losses should also be fewer.

Does the EA still close all orders at the end of the trading day before the Far East markets open?  If so, one of the downsides I see is that the orders would have less time to do their thing.  It will be interesting to see what effect different 'start' times will have on the results.  Even more curious, will each pair have a 'best' time for the EA to initiate the pending the orders?  For example, maybe EURUSD works best when the orders are started at the open of London where USDJPY may work best when the orders are started at the open of New York.

The potential is endless - but the possibilities may my head hurt...

Any more thoughts....

Tim

This could come down to us watching the trends and working out when the trend is retracing or about to retrace. For example, take a rising trend. The price could trigger one of our orders just before a retrace kicks in and wipes out the trade. Logically, we should be able to look at the chart and note when the rising price should be about to falter because the price rises in waves, yet we all know how difficult this is to do.

Ye Gods, anybody got any headache pills?

This thread started with a fire-and-forget strategy. Here we are trying to turn it into a fire-and-make-even-better strategy. Life isn't easy, is it?

Ok, my demo account has sent the pending orders at 22.00 gmt (5.00 pm est). My live account is set to do the same 10 hours later, at 8.00 am gmt (3.00 am est). It will be interesting to see what happens to the two sets of orders. Guess which I hope is right?

My best guess? Just as a trend is a trend or a blip depending on the time frame involved, so a breakout happens from whatever starting point is chosen or it doesn't. A breakout just prior to setting the pending orders automatically creates a fresh channel to set the orders by.

So, if the breakout is in the direction of the prevailing trend, then it is more likely to be a genuine breakout. If not, it is more likely to be a brief retrace. I am thinking about aloud here, and it is proving most useful. This encourages me to check the direction of the trend when looking at the orders the ea has set.

Hmmmmmmm. Simple, this forex business isn't it? The price goes up, so we buy and make a fortune. It falls, so we sell and make a fortune. If only.........

--- 帖子 #988 ---
I decided to "go live" with this strategy on Monday... with horrific results.

But in my demo accounts previously, I did see some good results, so I do see promise.

In my experimentation I tried lots of pairs. But now I am returning to the six pairs posted in the original. And we'll see if things improve. Certainly when we have a range bound session (like tonight) not much is gonna happen. Or when we have violent breakouts, retracements, and then

reversals, this is the worst scenario for the strategy. This reminds me of the ORB strategy I once used in futures.

Here is my question: look at the net exposure of the strategy. It seems that in the original six pairs, it is Euro-centric somewhat. Is this just a net Euro play? Or did you do some work to balance it in some cases?

Secondly, the EURGBP pip value is almost twice that of most other pairs. Do you halve your volume then to account for this?

Thanks for a very interesting strategy.

Longboard

--- 帖子 #989 ---
I first tried the strategy on my demo acct. with good results on the 15th, got all 90pips. So I dedided to try it on my live acct. and be smart with only one position, didn't work out too well. Used 30pip s/l with a 40 pip t/p. Got stopped out. Had I used the strategy as spelled out, would have been stopped out but with a 15pip gain. Going to go back to the demo for a while using the strategy as planned.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
What you described was not going live with this system.  You set an entry order with a 40 pip limit and a 30 pip stop.  That isn't this system.

People seem to be misunderstanding that the power of this system is in the number of variations a day can have.  The day can range from -90 to +95 with many possibilities in between.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
OK then how did the system do last night? Are my results far off?

I've tried to follow the system exactly as laid out using +15, +30, +50TP, and -30SL. I have used the original pairs GBPUSD, EURUSD, GBPJPY, USDJPY, EURJPY, EURGBP. I enter the orders as of 5PMEST.

I use Oanda so I do not have an EA.

As of 9:54EST today I have -105.

S EURUSD  -45

S USDJPY  +15

S GBPUSD  -90

S EURJPY   +15

The rest of the orders are pending, the EURGBP being the closest at 11.6 ticks.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
I think this is just a bad week for the system... but overall performance should outweigh this drawdown...I for one, am still positive about the performance.  Any system you use will eventually have a bad week or two, you cant win them all...

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Very much agreed. I just would like to find out others' results to make sure I am implementing the strategy correctly.

BTW, more pips also = more surfing!

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Another decent day, using the IBFX fall EA on IBFX demo,

EURUSD = +15 pips

EURJPY = +45 pips

USDJPY = +15 pips

+75 pips for Friday,

I'm putting the CHFJPY back as the fourth pair on the strategy as its had three very good days this week, see how it does.

Might take this live with small lot sizes middle of next week.

This is a great and consistently good system, I'll not be trading it on Sunday / Monday - too dodgy after this weeks Monday results eek!

Very impressed

Hi all and thanks for the great thread...

I recently found this and decided to try and help with some demo testing.  My setup is as follows:

11 IBFX demo accounts with the appropriate EA

Running on all 19 currency pairs offered by IBFX and 1 hour charts

50k demo accounts trading 1 fixed mini lot

Since times have come up a bit I decided to make 11 accounts to try different start times and look back hours as follows:Demo #01) Start 22EST / Look back 17Original strategy  Demo #02) Start 00GMT / Look back 23Tokyo open back 23hrs (almost a full day)  Demo #03) Start 08GMT / Look back 23London open back 23hrs (almost a full day)   Demo #04) Start 13GMT / Look back 23New York open back 23hrs (almost a full day)   Demo #05) Start 22GMT / Look back 23Sydney open back 23hrs (almost a full day)  Demo #06) Start 00GMT / Look back 02Tokyo open back to Sydney open  Demo #07) Start 08GMT / Look back 08London open back to Tokyo open (00GMT)  Demo #08) Start 13GMT / Look back 05New York open back to London open  Demo #09) Start 22GMT / Look back 09Sydney open back to New York open  Demo #10) Start 13GMT / Look back 13New York open back to Tokyo open (00GMT)  Demo #11) Start 22GMT / Look back 22Sydney open back to Tokyo open (00GMT)  The idea would be to run the demos and try to take out pairs that never do well and maybe find out how pairs do during different start times and based off of different look back hours.  Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
An excellent Idea. If you have the fortitude to keep the accounts running for the next two or three Months, you'll hopefully get some excellent data for the best times for each currency, as I'm sure different currencies have an optimal time.

Great work dude!

Ok I've not included the results from monday as I'm not going to trade that day, call me a big Jessie if you will!

I'm running the IBFX fall EA with default settings, orders set at 22:00 gmt.

I'm running the official three pairs as well as CHFJPY due to the good results I have. As I hadnt examined the data till earlier and had decided to stick to the three official pairs I didn't set the CHFJPY EA running last night and have no daily data for that pair from today, so as a worst case scenario I've assumed it hit - 90 pips.

Week starting 12/11/07 EURJPY EURUSD USDJPY CHFJPY

Tuesday ++++++++++++95+++++ 0 ++++15+++++ 0

Wednesday ++++++++++15++++ 45++++ 0 +++++95

Thursday +++++++++++15++++ +15 +++45 +++++95

Friday ++++++++++++++45++++ 15++++ 15+++ (-90)

Week total +420 pips - woohoo!

Not half shabby I think you'll agree!

I wouldn't be exagerating to say I'm wetting myself with excitement at this point, and as me and my buddy Steve Hopwood the fibo professor have opt said, I hate weekends, when does the trading start again?

Off to get some adult diapers in case i have some over-excitement issues over the weekend lol ,

Thanks again to MikeLath, Primer et al for this exciting and freely shared system,

Health and many pips to all!

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Thanks for the quick support and I will keep everyone posted as frequently as I can.  I will post results at least once a week.  I should also mention that doing anything special around news events would be a major amount of work such as disabling certain pairs when news is released which may affect certain pairs.  I will make my best efforts to track major news events and note them in the results I post.  If trades opened 3 hours ago and news hits there isn't much you can do about it anyways.

I think once time frames and pairs are selected then managing upcoming news events will be easier.  You could choose not to run the EA on certain pairs if news is close to coming out.

Also, I noticed that the S/L is set without considering the spread.  If a spread is 5 and you start -5 when the trade opens then you really only have 25 pips breathing room right from the start.  Is that the best way or should the spread be considered when setting a S/L?  Some ideas off the top of my head for EA mods might be...

Consider the spread.  Maybe a setting for max spread allowed?  In other words, you could say you don't want to trade unless the spread is less than or equal to say 5 or some other number.  IBFX can fluctuate a good deal throughout the day and even the EUR/USD can get a pretty wide spread at times.  I think this can have a tendency to hurt EAs because it can get out of hand at times and this would give us more control over choosing our conditions to trade.

Another setting (True/False) for spread to be included in the S/L calculation.  That way you can choose to use it or not.

I am a programmer so I added a line to show a chart comment showing me the start time and look back hours on the chart.  This and maybe some other items shown as chart comments are helpful in saving time so you don't have to check the settings manually.  It helps me when running 11 demo accounts each with 19 pairs running.  Future updates would be great with this added.

I haven't given the code a great deal of time when looking at it and would like to say that I think it runs well and does what it should.  Please don't take my wish list as a dig in any way.  I have programmed dozen of EAs myself and know what is involved.  My thanks to the programmer responsible for coding it.

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Nice one! I'll wait for Mike to correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this is a mechanical system and as such once the orders are running you can leave them run regardless of news etc, that's what I've been doing. However I know some people like to baby the trades in order to minimise losses/maximise wins.

My feeling is that you could leave all the orders run through news without change - this would mean that all results you obtained should be robust, easily reproduceable and can be used as a worst case baseline.

Many people may feel my views are wrong and please let me know if you have better ideas?

Anyway, thanks again mtab!

Cal

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
The fact is simple.  I like to be as lazy as I can be and would prefer not to baby the demos but rather point out when news hit on the results.  In the end I will judge for myself as follows:

Which pairs did the best in which time frames?

How much did news affect the results?

Could some pairs have been better if news was avoided?

News can help as much as it hurts so to cut it out may not be needed.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
I'm using the EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD and the USD/JPY for Daily Pips. My total pfofit with wins and losses for the week of 11/12 through 11/16 with all 5 pairs was +95 pips. The Piazza method EA during the same week produced a total of +125 pips with the GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY and EUR/JPY. We'll see what we have at the end of the month. Paris.

If it is possible to throw the results into an excel spreadsheet, I would be happy to help you analyze the results.   I pretty sure others on the thread would help also....

I have been testing the system on my demo account for four weeks now on  GBP\JPY , EUR\JPY ,USD\JPY and GPP\CHF and results are pretty good . In my short experience I have noticed that most of the times  the first target of 15 pips is hit even in losing trades .

So , I got an idea to adjust trade size as follows :two lots with tp 15 pips , one lot with tp 30 pips and one with tp 50 pips . Of course , it increases risk ,since at worst scenario the loss would be 105 pips instead of 90 , but if the first target is hit ,which happens in most cases , the risk is pretty rewarding .

What do you think of it ?

Happy pipping

I have spent the last few days reading every single post on this thread.  wow! 2630 pips for the month is great.  Is anyone trading this live yet? If nto why not?  I am going to begin testing this too on my demo account beginning on sunday.  I am excited about this. Also, I like the idea of place a double on the first 15 pip profit.  I will be checking that out too.

good job to everyone. I will post my results too.

I have a question in reguards to this trading idea.  I have been looking at this for several days now and love the idea of how this works.  As yoy have explained pending orders are placed at HIGH +5 and LOW -5,  That means if the market goes up and hits HIGH +5 then we now have three long orders on the pair.  If the market turns down then we have three pos at risk with a 30 pip stop loss on each.  Here is my idea and I am wondering if anyone has thought of this or tested this. Here it goes..... what if the three orders were placed at HIGH +5, HIGH +7 HIGH +9.  Then if the market hits the first one and it is triggered then goes down, the risk is only on one pos and NOT all three.  If in fact the market is going to go high enought to make a profit of all three for a total of 95 pips, then we would be giving up a couple pips profit. The way I see it is this might be a saft guard that would save a few losses.  What do you think and is it possible to back test this idea against the reg 95 pip plan.  I would be currious to see if running a back test against this if it would return more pips threw not losing pos.

I am looking forward to hearing what you guys think about this idea. I am going to begin to test this on my demo account as soon as the market opens.

Good idea gonadoit.

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Hi guys..

I have gone live with the daily95 using Oanda. Attached is the log file which I use and since it is manual you may noticed that at some point, I may have missed to bring the stop loss to break even.

In a nutshell,here are my results:

Active   EUR/JPY   106

Active USD/JPY   225

Active EUR/USD   130

Hi guys, I am still wondering if anyone could share some light on the EA for the NorthFinance so that it could work according to Mike's Rule.

I hope piphunter could share some light to this issue. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I have downloaded all the minute by minute tick data and a friend and I are setting up a system to back test this system in MS access for the past 6 six years.  We will share the results when we are finished.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
Endroute.... great idea I am looking forward to your results.  May I be so bold as to ask you to test my idea of different entries.  (posted above).  I am wondering if that is a good strag for protecting funds?  Also can someone help me with a really simple question?  I have MIG metatrader.  Where or how to I get the Highs and Lows to determine how to place my pending orders? I can not seem to locate them anyplace.

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
You can use the Spudfibo ind. attached to this thread. Alternatively, I have attached a prev. day hi/lo indicator. Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Hi all.

The attached pic illustrates my only remaining concern about the EA.

We can see that the EA doesn't calculate the new orders for the day when the current price ( the price at the time of calculating the orders) is close to the high or low. In this case it is the long orders that have not been calculated.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This pic is for the EURUSD orders for today, Sun-Mon 17-18 Nov.

So I make a humble request for all programmers including Pr1mer and PipHunter to try to collectively rectify this bug because the EA is VERY close to being fully efficient.

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
This is caused by the fact, that it's impossible to place stop orders close to market price. A margin is required - usually 5 pips, may differ depending on the broker.

What's the proper action in such a case? Open orders or shift stop orders?

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/C:%5CPro...rs_nov19th.gifMike and all

The EA generated the Buy pending orders for me (which have since been filled.)

BTW I hope I did the chart thingy right....

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Thanks for responding on this Pr1mer. I see what you mean about the required margin and the size of that margin varying depending on the broker....

Is it possible to add a feature to the EA so that when this scenario occurs the EA will still be able to calculate orders ?

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
great....

it will be a handy guide for all of us

that way we all can see how this method survive the past six years

i hope the result will be in positive

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
The question is: should the EA open long positions (in the case you showed) or place resting stop orders a few pips higher?

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
I'm not really sure what resting stop orders are, however if they are what it takes to get both long and short orders placed for the day then by all means please do the needful to the EA by programming this feature.

All of us with no programming experience are at the mercy of your good self in this regard, so if you can help we'll all be eternally grateful.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Dear Pr1mer.

I just did a quick google search for resting orders...

Ok, so what I'd like to suggest is that if it is possible, we could have the EA place orders as per usual when the current price (at 5pmEST) is not too close to the high and have a backup feature so that if price IS too close the EA will place resting orders instead...say 10-15pips(or whatever you think is necessary) away from the current price.

What do you think ?

Is it feasible ?

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
I really like your strategy Mike but I was wondering if you're still using it as described in post #1 or if there are any new rules added. I've read alot about people wanting to try trailing stops, moving them to break even, etc. Has any of this proved to be more effective? I would like to start trading this on a demo account but would like to make sure I'm trading it the best way possible. Also, are the EA's that people are using the same as in post #1 or have they been modified? If so, which is bringing the best results? (Although I'll be trading manually).

Thanks for your help,

Corey

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
I was also wondering if you're still closing your trades early or letting them run the full 24 hours.

Thanks again,

Corey

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Hi Corey.

The rules are as per post#1.

The EA is as per post#1.

So far, I'm personally in favour of moving the stops to BE after the 1st profit target has been reached. This may or may not be the more profitable approach.  I haven't had a lot of extra pips from using the trailing stop, though theoretically it does keep open such potential.

My preferred settings for the EA are therefore UpdateToBE:15 and no trailing stop on the 3rd order.

Any open trades are let run for the full 24hrs.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
Thanks, I think thats the best idea. Although a trailing stop would help sometimes, I feel it would also stop you out too early. I read that somebody had the idea of trading more than one lot on the first order (15 pip order). Have you tried this? I wonder how often the first target is reached if the buy/sell order is executed. It would make the overall risk/reward worse but if the first target is reached 90% of the time then it would be worth it. Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Corey

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Hi all,

I am using the fall EA for IBFX.  Last night 5pm (ET), the EA set my trades automatically.  For some reason, a few of the pairs had DOUBLE trades set (not amount to trade, but 2 trades buy and sell).  Why did it do this?  Is this a Sunday problem?  I had no issues last week.  Also, this morning, when I checked the trade results, my account was down (I figured there were some losses, but the account history section of MT4 showed no loss amounts.  Just closed orders.  Any ideas?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
resting orders = stop orders

Ok, if it's not possible to place stop orders 5 pips above/below day high/low because current price is too close it, the EA will put them a bit further (closest possible distance dependant on the broker).

Cheers,

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
What do you mean by 'double'? Two buy stop orders with 15 pips TP, two bs orders with 30 TP, etc. ?

Maybe the orders weren't closed on Friday, stop losses were moved to break even point and swap cost was substracted from your profit? Just a guess, need more details.

Cheers,

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Yes, by double, I mean 2 buy stop orders and 2 sell stop orders for each of the 3 sets (i.e. 15pip, 30pip, 50pip).  I do not know why double orders happened.  I manually deleted the doubles.   I had NO orders left from Friday.  The EA has been doing a good job in that respect.

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
I had the EA running on two computers (same demo account).  Would this have anything to do with it?  I am not very computer savy.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Has anyone determined how accurate the Fall EA is, as opposed to entering the trades each day at 5pm manually?  The EA seems to get high and low prices that are not consistent if you do it manually (sometimes).  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Mike,

I see that you no longer include the GBP/USD pair.  Do you not trade this in the system anymore?  Please advise.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Yes, my experience with the TS is that it has been stopping out trades too early for less profit.

As of now I haven't tried 2 lots on the 1st order as suggested earlier, though I agree that it has promise...I'm apprehensive about worsening the risk:reward. I'll admit that I'm not up to speed on the stats on each scenario.

mike

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Correct. Surprisingly, GBPUSD has not performed well within the parameters of this strategy.

mike

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
When did you stop trading the GBP/USD pair?  Did you replace it with another, or do you just use the remaining 3.

Also, the Fall EA has a trailing stop of 20 as the default.  Did you make this value 0, as you do not like trailing stops, or do you leave the setting alone?  Thanks, Brian

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Is anyone else trading ODL and having any issues w/ trades opening? Doubles, incorrect opening times? Wondering if I'm the only one. I also have an FXDD account which opened fine. Not quite sure what's up. Any thoughts/suggestions appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Greetings,

I believe it is b/c the EA uses a risk percentage to calc trades although I am not sure. If you put in a fixed amount under FixedLots in the settings file, I think this entry (FixedLots) will exclude the double entries you are experiencing, next time your EA generates orders.

I might be wrong and perhaps Pr1mer can contribute.

Regards,

Sam

mike what is your experience with trading for a living and how much would one needs to trade for a living? I mean $25K? 50K? and what is your experience in applying hans system in trading for a living?

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Hi samoora.

Firstly, my avatar phrase "trading for living" is more of an affirmation of what I'm aspiring for (if that's the reason you're asking).

I am definitely progressing to the stage of live trading and generating enough income from that to at least get me started with paying the bills.

How much do you need in your trading account to generate your desired income ? Well, firstly that really depends on how much your lifestyle depends upon or how much you would like to earn or how much is really enough...

Secondly, you have to consider the system you are trading, and equally important, your money management in order to achieve your desired income whilst preserving your trading capital.

For example, if you are trading a system where the risk:reward is 1:1 you will need to assess how much of your account you are willing to risk on each trade. From what I can gather the standard amongst professional traders is that they will not risk any more than 3% on each trade. So if you had a $10,000 account the max. you would risk on each trade is $300. This would be the amount you would lose if the trade was a loser and also be your profit if the trade is a winner. If you were fortunate enough to achieve an average of 1 winning trade per day you would end up with $1500 over 5 days of trading. Sounds simple doesn't it....but whoa, don't get too excited yet, because the reality can be and often is very different. Just consider if your 1st trade is a loser and your account balance is now $9700. 3% of that is $291. So even if you win the next trade you are still $9 behind. This may seem insignificant but can contribute to your account being eaten away and requiring significantly more winners to recover when you have a string of losing trades.

So basically the 2 important elements are:

1. A winning strategy

2. Good money management.

This is a simplistic explanation of how to approach live trading. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of being aware of the downside risk and managing that risk in order to stay in the game.

Regarding the hans system, I do not trade it. There is very little similarity between it and the Daily95pips system.

I hope this helps.

All 11 demos I am running are down at this point.  That doesn't upset me since we are looking for the best pairs, which start times, and how far back it looks for highs and lows.  Even though all demos are currently down I would bet that by the end of the week we will see that certain pairs did well in a variety of settings.  I will post the statements for each of the 11 demos as Excel spreadsheets minus the canceled trades so they can be analyzed.

I have also been running this EA on my live account using .01 fixed lots, 22 start, and 17 for look back.  I am running it on the EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, and USD/JPY.  First night was not fantastic but I am hopeful looking at others results.

EUR/JPY
-.27, -.27, -.27
EUR/USD
.15, .30, .50
USD/JPY
-.27, -.27, -.27
Total
-.67

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
I thought you were using a stop of 30 pips??

I see on your results that it was changed to 27.

Any reason?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
So I guess that's an answer. Both EAs put their orders at the beginning of the next day. That's correct behaviour: two EAs = double orders

Pr1mer

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Thanks Pr1mer.  I turned off the other PC's EA yesterday, and the problem resolved itself.  Apparently, if you have 2 pc running the same EA on the same demo account, it WILL double the amount of orders!

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
The EUR/JPY and USD/JPY are not worth $1 a pip on a mini lot.  I am only trading .01 mini lots so even though the pips are -30 they were only worth .27 cents.  My apologies not stating that the above post referred to the actual dollar amount and not pips.

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Hey endroute  good afternoon.

I saw an earlier post where you and a friend down loaded the past 6 years and planned on doing a back test.  I hope I am not imposing when i ask this but would it be possible for you to explain exactly how and where I could obtain the past years tick data and down load it. Along with how to back test.   I am working on a little program myself along with everyone else here and I would like to test my ideas.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
I know it is very early to post this but here is a taste of the results I am getting so far.  Each pair/row is colored from dark green (best) to dark red (worst).  The columns show the start time (GMT) and look back hours.  Ex: 08-23 starts at 08 GMT and looks back 23 bars/hours since everything is being run on 1 hour charts.  I think the EA looks at hourly bars regardless of what you time frame is for the chart.  Some trades are still open, some haven't been triggered yet so it is early still.  These results are also based on all the defaults except start and look back hours and I have set fixed lots to 1.

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
Is it correct to say that this 95 daily PIPS system works with the greatest results by trading EUR/USD, EUR/JPY & USD/JPY?  It is my understanding that the GBP/USD pair was removed.  Is anyone else using different pairs or back to the GBP/USD pair?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
The results are for today or whole week?

Do you move your stoploss to BE after 1st TP?

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
The results are starting from Sunday afternoon slightly after the market opened.  I originally had all the demos running before the market opened on Sunday and when it did open I got all kinds of weird orders being placed most likely due to the time the difference between Friday afternoons time and the starting time on Sunday.  So I opened new accounts on each demo to get rid of all the pending orders and started around 6:30pm eastern on Sunday.  I notice since using IBFX that a lot of times on Sunday they don't start until 6pm eastern time as well.  Doesn't the market open at 5pm on Sundays (eastern time)?  Anyways, I am using the IBFX fall EA with all the default which would include UpdateToBE = 15.  I have only changed FixedLots to 1, DayStartHour to whatever, and LookBackHours to whatever.  When I say whatever I mean based on the spreadsheet above.

If you look at the spreadsheet above you will see that the EUR/GBP has made the most money since Sunday afternoon with $267.34.  The darker the green on a particular row the better the profit, the darker the red the worse it has done.  The EUR/GBP has done well with a start time of 13 GMT and look back of 13 hours/bars and has done the worst using 00 GMT with a look back of only 2 hours/bars (what I expected).  The EUR/GBP has done rather well under most of the situations above but we also need to remember that a pip is worth almost double for the EUR/GBP.

You can also see that $20.46 is the best that the EUR/CAD has done starting at 13 GMT with a look back of 13 hours/bars.  The EUR/CAD has not done well under any time setting yet but that may change over time.

I am running 11 demo accounts on all of the 19 pairs listed above.  The only thing that varies from one account to the next is the start time and look back hours/bars.  All times listed above are GMT and are laid out to overlap using all the different market open times and even looking back almost a whole day as well.  I will post the spreadsheet clip above as time goes on so that we can all see which pairs do well under which time settings.  Looking back at some of the previous posts I see that some weeks are just a killer and that a majority do well like the post showing ove 2630 pips since August.  I am just curious to see if there may be better choices for certain pairs with certain start and look back hours/bars.

Anyways, I am rambling now and I hope I answered your questions and clarified how to read the screen shot above.

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
Looks like another choppy week... ((

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
Looks like IBFX will be closed between 9am est to 6 pm est.  I plan to leave all accounts running and will keep a close eye on the charts around 6pm to make sure the EA doesn't open any improper trades.  When the time freezes at 9am and then all of a sudden jumps to 6pm later in the day there could be undesirable results from the EA.  I only say that because the EA got confused between Friday and Sunday when the time shifted.

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Thank you. Good job.

bjks801.

I understand that as the thread progresses there becomes an increasing number of posts to read to get the full picture of how the thread has evolved.

If you had read all the posts you would now know that EJ, UJ and EU are the remaining shortlisted pairs from an initial list of 6 which included GBPUSD.

You would also know that GBPUSD was removed because of it's poor performance within the parameters of this strategy.

This has simply been how my forward testing has panned out.

You are welcome to try as many pairs as you like in order to ascertain which pairs work best.

You also may have noticed that mtaboneweb is currently undertaking a very thorough evaluation of numerous pairs to assess which pairs perform best based on different settings of the DayStarHour in the EA.

This testing should help everyone interested in this strategy.

A different broker perhaps....my posted results are from a North Finance demo.

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
Mike,

I use IBFX.  Could a different broker REALLY make such a difference?  The difference is HUGE!  Has anyone else had the same results as me this week?

Another thought...Mike, does your EA cancel the other orders when one is executed (i.e. cancels the sells when the buys trigger)?

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Yes, this is much closer to my results. I also lost 90 in the EURUSD last night.  Every day this week was a loser.  I use Oanda, so I manually enter order at the trade time.

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
Yea... I've got the same results as well. I'm down this week too

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Same results here also. Mike are you still entering your trades at 5pm EST?

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
I am posting my results for the 22-17 here.  I was wondering if you could tell me how our trades differ because my results are somewhat different from yours.  Could be that I started on Sunday afternoon or something else.  I'm just curious how close our trades might be.

I am using IBFX.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
Here is the latest...

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Mikelath says he's running a North finance demo and I am running IBFX.  I haven't had much luck with IBFX and I'm wondering why I continue to use them.  Some of the strangest things have happened with IBFX and I don't believe they're very straight forward.  Whenever the news hits their charts freeze for sometimes extended periods (5-10-20 seconds), their spreads fluctuate on a regular basis even when the market is relatively calm, running EAs in demos almost always ends up being different from running live.  I have picked a few scenarios from all the demos I am running and made them run on my live account as well (0.01 fixed lots) and the results are not on par with each other.

When I first started trading a few years back I used Intellicharts Desktop and FXCM.  I was programming in IntelliScript and using TradeItself as a middle man (program).  Intellicharts was programmed to send emails when I needed them and then TradeItself would check that email account and place trades, modify orders, etc. on the FXCM trading platform.  That's why I switched to brokers that could use MetaTrader but I miss Intellicharts and the FXCM data stream.  Things never froze for me during news, the spreads stayed more consistent, etc.  The only problem was FXCM does not use MetaTrader.

I know there is a thread here that discusses brokers but it seems like a lot of opinions and I'm not sure if there are any clear cut winners.

Is there a broker out there that uses MetaTrader that feels reliable?

Should I be testing on something other than IBFX?

Is there someone better?

Is IBFX the only broker that closed for Thanksgiving?  Is the Forex market closed now as well?

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
i am testing the ibfx version (DST) and got stopped out on EJ yesterday (21).

there is a new version? Piphunter is not running the EA anymore?

here is my statement

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
I know this question may have nothing to do with this thread... but is there a similar program to TradeItself that supports FXSol platform?

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Not that I know of.  The TradeItself was always kind of a band aid fix anyways and didn't always function well.  I keep getting frustrated with MetaTrader and thinking about switching to something else but the truth is that it's IBFX that is the source of my frustration.  MetaTrader is a great program, I'm just not sure if there is a decent broker out there that also uses MetaTrader.  Anything else is manual trading, middle man programs, etc.

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
Mtaboneweb,

FXCM will be taking on the MT4 platform very soon apparently.  But don't think for one minute they are any more trust worthy than IBFX.  I have traded with both for years and they both manipulate spot data when it suits.  I have a hedge EA that shows (proves) that IBFX are skimming a pip on about 30% of my trade entries when I use it live.

And as far as FXCM goes - well they are just plain evil   But I still have an account with them .... there are no honest brokers in forex.

If you want a regulated broker - go trade furtures.

Sorry a bit off topic - but no doubt relavant to the varied results everyone is getting.

Tim

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
Mikelath,

I downloaded and start to run a North Finance demo account as well but I noticed they are 2 hours ahead of the IBFX demos.  If that is the demo you are running are you still using 22 as a start time or do you use 00 since they are 2 hours ahead?

On another note, this week has been scattered for results with the holiday and all so I am planning on starting my testing over at the beginning of next week.  11 demos with 19 currencies also appears to be too much for my computer.  I am going to look at narrowing down the currency pairs an maybe cut out a time frame or two (like 00 back 2 hours).  I am also doing this so that maybe I can run a couple of north finance demos as well to get any possible differences between brokers.  I will adjust all time frames for the North Finance demos so they start at the same time as the IBFX demos.  That's part of why I'm wondering how you set your time.  If you are using 22 with the IBFX version of the EA that could be part of why our results are different.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Hi Mike ,

In your early posts you mentioned testing GBP/JPY , and according to the results you posted the performance of the pair was quite good . I am testing it for three weeks now and so far it shows pretty good results . What was the reason for removal of the pair from your list ?

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Hey mtaboneweb.

I'm simply using the North Finance fall version of the EA in a North Finance demo account with the DayStartHour setting at 0. This means that the EA is calculating and placing orders at 5pm EST.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
Hiya al.

Yes, GBPJPY started off ok, however if you take a look at post# 499 you'll see why I removed this pair from the list.

If your forward testing of this pair over a longer timeframe proves it to be nicely profitable then I'll consider including it again.

Please keep me posted.

Comment: The forward testing continues to support these 3 pairs as being the most consistently profitable. I'm now simply posting whatever results the EA provides despite times when the long or short orders for the day are not calculated due to the high or low being too close to the current price at 5pm EST.

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
OK, I am not forward testing, I am doing this live. I want to make sure that "theoretical" results in demos versus actuals differences are worked out and I mitigate that risk by trading very very small size. I don't have a lot of faith in demos. I also haven't yet found an MT4 broker I trust. So instead of writing EAs and relying on such results as proof of concept, if I can't enter the orders manually and get the same results, how can I trust that the strategy really works?

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now about the last sentence, how does one change an order if long or short orders _are_ close to the actual price at trade time?

Perhaps if I could quantify what is done in that case, my results would be closer to what you are showing in your demo?? Do you have an algorithm for such cases? In the last week at least three times the order price has indeed been close to the actual price at the trade time.

Do you fade the trade then? Move out the trade time?

Thanks.

Hi Longboard.

I admire your courage in already trading this strategy live...though I agree that it's the best way to get an accurate assessment.

During the course of this thread the results that I've been posting have been a combination of demo , paper and EA traded results. They will definitely not be 100% accurate, however they do serve to give as all an idea of the potential of this strategy.

I am now posting results that are solely based on the performance of the EA, getting us closer to what we'd expect the live results to be.

Once I see the next few weeks to be consistently profitable as we have seen over the past 13 weeks, I will take the EA live.

Regarding when price is too close to the high or low resulting in no orders being calculated, pr1mer (who created the EA) may be working on a backup feature for the EA which will place orders further away from the current price in times when the above scenario occurs. I'm patiently awaiting his updated version of the EA.

Thanks Mike,

I know this has been covered, but I want to make doubly sure about time execution and description.

When you post results for Monday November 19, you are writing about the trades initiated at the beginning of the session of Sunday the 18th  (based upon the previous Friday's closes). So those trades are closed out on the 19th.  I ask because you are in Brisbane and date lines, etc. can be confusing to a mere trader, like me.

Thanks,

Craig

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
Hiya Craig.

Correct. My posted results for Monday are for trades that are placed on Sunday at 5pm EST which equates to 8am on a Monday here in Brisbane.

The original criteria for Sunday/Monday orders was to go back as far as midnight on the previous Friday morning.

Because I'm now simply using the EA I'm guessing that it is calculating Sunday/Monday's orders the same as every other day. I'm cool with that as I'm looking for regularity and consistency.

I've got a bit different results. This is one of the days when trailing stops proved to be really usefull: only 3rd order for EURJPY gave 97 pips and 3rd order for EURUSD - 70pips. So totally:

EURJPY: +143

EURUSD: +105

I am trading D95P live, & not with tiny pips either, it is working very well, thank you, Mike Lath.

I only trade EUR/USD , USD/JPY & the EUR/JPY, they have proven themselves & quite frankly any more pairs are just too hard to handle.

I trade manually & I place my trades at about 2100 GMT with buy & sell stops. I look back at how my trades progress around the Frankfurt/London open & adjust stops accordingly.

As the forex market is a 24 hour Market, I don't religously use the previous Days H/L for my calculations, If there was a swing H/L the previous 48 hours, I will Indeed use that, & especially if on the new GMT Day, it is just a continuation of the previous day, I go back to the swing point & use that as my reference & place that in my spreadsheet I gave you all earlier.

Also, if there is a large spread between the High & the low & the market is near a previous H/L & is close to taking me in, I won't place a trade in the opposite direction if it has to rally 200 or more points to take me in, hence, I trade the breakout in the direction of the trend, & allocate more money as per money management into this trade.

Also, look at earlier support/resistance, & significant levels, eg, EUR/USD at 1.5000, these whole numbers are VERY important.

As well I use Fibonnacci levels to aid my trading.

You just can't blindly trade a "system" you must use your skills as well, after all, the price is always right,

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
Agreed. And I do believe that with some tweaking, this system has a lot of promise. Everyone has different objectives in their approach to trading. I value algorithmic trading in which human intervention is either very limited or not needed. Otherwise I would just scalp markets and trade by the "seat of my pants".  I do not any longer have the freedom to do that or get up at all hours of the 24 hr. cycle. I did that for many years. And one of Mike's stated objectives was to "set and forget". So at least for me, the more I can "set" the trade and its parameters, the better. Since you also enter your trades manually like I do, the fact that you are finding success is quite encouraging to me.

Sydney market just opened after the weekend - 23.00 Sunday night London time.

The Gap certainly showed up tonight. This could easily be missed looking at 1h charts, so look at the 5 min chart to see the gap in action.

Last week was just a losing one for me, although I am still well ahead overall.

The EA has behaved beautifully except for the opening of the Sydney market at 23.00 London time. I have it timed to set orders at 08.00 London time - the first ones should be set on Monday morning; it set orders at the opening of the Sydney market at 23.00 Sunday night, London time. I deleted them all.

Good luck for the coming week everyone. Especially good luck to those of us already using this strategy live.

I have been following this thread for quite a while, and downloaded the IBFX fall EA and started using it this past Thursday.

My results for Thursday were:

EURJPY +15

USDJPY -90

EURUSD -90

For Friday no trades were triggered (could it be because of Thanksgiving?)

As for tonight it placed a buy stop in USDJPY at 110.87 (in the last three daily candles it has not been anywhere near that), and a sell stop in EURUSD at 1.4607 (in the last three daily candles it has not been anywhere near that), and did not place anything in EURJPY.

I was just wondering if anyone else using the IBFX EA was having the same issues.

Hi all,

Did anyone out there have trouble with the EA setting the trades today at 5pm?  I had mine set (well before 5pm), and came back a few hours later to see that no trades were automatically placed.  I entered them manually.  Any ideas?

Also,

Can someone please tell me what the settings should be for the EAMagicNo for

the EUR/USD, EUR/JPY & USD/JPY?  I do not know if mine are correct.  Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
I spent the better part of yesterday reading every post on this thread. New to this board and thanks to all who have contributed. The EA is amazing, and to have taken the time to make separate ones for the various brokers!!! That is absolutely incredible. Thanks to all, and I look forward to continued success as I would like to try this one live. Oh, and yes....I have this EA on three separate demos. I loaded the appropriate ones to IBFX, North Finance and ODL. The only one that activated was the one on ODL. I see someone else had the same problem.

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
If you set DayStartHour to something before 5pm EST, the orders weren't set because trading starts at 5 on Sunday. Maybe I should add a feature of setting Sunday orders on the first hour?

Leave default settings and don't bother about it as long as you don't use other EAs.

Trading doesn't start for IBFX on Sunday until 6pm EST.  The EA reacts strange for me on Sundays opening double pending orders (12 for each pair).

I have changed my strategy for testing as follows:

Demo 1: IBFX 22-17 (19 pairs)

Demo 2: IBFX 13-17 (19 pairs)

Demo 3: IBFX 08-17 (19 pairs)

Demo 4: NF 00-17 (19 pairs)

Demo 5: NF 15-17 (19 pairs)

Demo 6: NF 10-17 (19 pairs)

22-17 is start hour of 22GMT (5pm EST) looking back 17 hours.

13-17 is start hour of 13GMT (NY open) looking back 17 hours.

08-17 is start hour of 08GMT (London open) looking back 17 hours.

00-17 is start hour of 22GMT (5pm EST) looking back 17 hours.

15-17 is start hour of 13GMT (NY open) looking back 17 hours.

10-17 is start hour of 08GMT (London open) looking back 17 hours.

North Finance is 2 hours ahead of the IBFX accounts as far as time goes so each are set for 2 hours more than the IBFX demos.

This seems like a good test and I decided to leave everything for 17 hour look backs because that is enough to just slightly overlap a previous market open and is not a full day.  My reasoning is to see which pairs do best under which time frames and see if IBFX does better than NF or vice versus.

I restarted my testing because last week was a mess with the holiday and I noticed that NF was running during Thanksgiving?  IBFX shut down for a good portion of the day which just messed things up.  Also, IBFX doesn't start until 6pm EST whereas my NF demos all started ticking well before 5pm EST.  And then there is the issue with IBFX EA opening double orders on Sundays when the market opens.  I think it best to start the IBFX demos just after 6pm EST on Sundays and run all week long.

I am also running live on the 3 pairs Mikelath is running on my IBFX account.  The situation was the same opening double pending orders on my live account which was scary.  I only have $72 left in that account and am trading 0.01 fixed lots.  I almost closed it a few weeks back but left a minimal amount just in case.  Once I found this thread I was inspired to think I might have a chance again.  It will be a good test to see what can happen starting with $72 dollars.

Last nights live account results...

USD/JPY +15 (buy at 108.61)

EUR/JPY +15 (buy at 161.13)

EUR/USD not triggered yet (buy at 1.4943 / sell at 1.4808)

This is after manually closing all the double orders the EA opened 6 pending orders for all 3 pairs again.

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
I noticed on the NF 15-17 that the NZD/USD only placed buy stops.

The NF 10-17 only placed sell stops on the AUD/USD and only buy stops on the USD/CAD.

I also noticed that the prices are off between brokers which can be expected but some are a good distance from each other.

IBFX
AUD/CAD buy 0.8722 / sell 0.8649
NF
AUD/CAD buy 0.8724 / sell 0.8654

IBFX
AUD/USD buy 0.8877 / sell 0.8740
NF
AUD/USD buy 0.8876 / sell 0.8761

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
For USDJPY I see how you made 15 pips one one of the trades.

But at approximately 2100 EST you would have been stopped out

on the other two lots at 108.31. Your net would be -15, not +15,

or you manually intervened?

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
The EA moves SL to break even once 15 pips is hit on the first order.  The 30TP and 50TP orders were stopped out at break even.  I only manually interfered to close all the initial pending orders which were doubled (6 buys and 6 sells for each pair).  The EA opened pending orders (3 buy stops and 3 sell stops for each pair) afterwards and I let the EA handle everything else.

My USD/JPY took its profit at 108.76 and my EUR/JPY took profit at 161.28.

As I'm typing this my EUR/USD orders just expired.  So I am up 30 pips today on my live account.  That's 0.28 cents since both pairs are not worth $1 a pip.

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
OK Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
Here are the results for Monday on the 22-17 demos.  Each of them have EUR/GBP trades running negative right now and I have a feeling this pair will lag since it doesn't move much.  So far it looks like the IBFX demo is doing better but only time will tell.  Also, the IBFX demo achieved the same 15 pips on the USD/JPY and EUR/JPY as my live account.  The EUR/USD was not triggered for any of the accounts.

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
I noticed that the NZD/JPY on the NF demo is -45 which should not happen.  The statement shows +15, -30, -30 for a total of -45.  I can only assume this happened because the SL was not moved up to break even when +15 was achieved.  If you look at my recent posts you can see other problems with the NF demos.

When setting up the NF demos they also took forever to create demo accounts whereas IBFX is usually very fast.  I am going to go out on a limb and say NF is a little sluggish.

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
Attached is my latest chart.

If 0 then trade wasn't triggered or hasn't been triggered yet.

Darkest green is the most profitable on a row.

Darkest red is the least profitable on a row.

Take the AUD/JPY row as an example.  It has pips for all demos meaning all were triggered.  It did the best on the IBFX demo with 22 start hour and 17 look back hours.  It did the worst on the first 3 columns/demo accounts.  13-17 (NF) and 22-17 (NF) are a lighter green and were positive but not as good as 22-17 (IBFX).

Column J (Pair Totals) colors are the same idea.  This column is a total of each row/pair.  The GBP/CHF is the best and darkest green for the column.

Row 22 (Account Totals) show the total for each column/account and graded with color like all the others.

Column H (22-17 (Live IBFX)) is my real account.  I am running this with 0.01 fixed lots, 22 start hour, 17 look back hours, Update to break even at 15, all the rest are defaults.  I am only running this on the EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, USD/JPY pairs.

These results are not complete for the first day and can not be considered hard evidence for anything yet.  As time passes I am sure things will start to look different.  The 08-17 and 13-17 demos still have many pending orders which will make things look different when completed.  The main purpose is to put this out there for any feedback, suggestions, etc.

Mikelath has done a great job here and I value is experience.  This testing is to suit my own curiosity and see what would happen in different time frames and different brokers.

Hello. It seems there are quite a few trading this successfully. Reading posts #1 to present, I believe it's o.k. to conclude that this a strategy based on mathematics (expansion of TP levels and daily HL) which is what has peaked my interest. However analyzing the formula, trading on paper, and with various backtesting, there are a few things that don't quite boost my confidence in trading this strategy. Many have mentioned that ranging markets would work best. Could someone please explain this, as I'm just not getting it. In a ranging market it is very likely to get losses on both sides. Would this not work better when price trends and is moving unidirectional? Even when price does move in one direction, it seems the likelihood of taking on losses is still very high. I think this system needs an improved method of taking back one's losses.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
Hi GridTrader.

To a degree this strategy reduces our risk against the effect of a ranging market by having a relatively small first profit target whereby if achieved the stoploss on the 2 remaining orders is adjusted to breakeven. We do see that price will sometimes trigger the orders and then immediately retrace and stopout all 3 orders for a -90pips result.

Bear in mind that the EA has a OCO feature that cancels the long orders when the short orders are triggered and visa versa, eliminating the possibility of getting losses on both sides.

Earlier in the thread there was considerable discussion on the idea of the markets ranging more than trending, thus suggesting the odds being against the success of this strategy. I for one am always open to any positive alternative and a ranging system based on using ATR was touched upon, however not developed sufficiently for greater acceptance. For a while I simultaneously traded a basic ranging strategy along with the D95P system to compare results. There was an idea that one could hedge against the other. My realisation was that not only did the ranging strategy require a lot more development, both strategies tended to cancel out the results of the other. Thus it made more sense to rely on one or the other. Because my focus has been testing the D95P system which relies on a breakout from the previous days high or low I've maintained that focus in order to present clear conclusive results which form the real assessment of it's worth.

So despite the apparent odds being against this strategy based on it being a trending system rather than a ranging one, ultimately if it's providing good results then all other considerations are rendered less significant.

You're suggestions for improving this system are most welcome.

Mike,

Am in awe of all of yours and others contribution to this concept.  Wish my head would stop spinning tho!

For uniformity sake, when you posts your results, are you still at "UpdatetoBE" of 30, No Trailstop,  LookBack of 17,  OrderExpire at 23?

Thanks so much  EVERYONE!

Keith

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
OK, But this system seems to have changed considerably from what was proposed at the outset. If you are manually setting trades, an OCO or trailing stop feature would not be possible. Now it seems the only way this becomes a profitable strategy is to either watch the manual trade and adjust the stops accordingly or to trade the EA. And in my case I do not use an MT4 broker. I was attracted to the strategy because of its simplicity and "set and forget" feature.

Tonight using the original strategy,you'd be down 90 on USDJPY and up 15 on EURJPY. I will continue to test, however. (Assuming using EURUSD, USDJPY and EURJPY)

I would also be interested to test the posted profitability versus trending indicators. When the market breaks out and continues in a direction, it works. However this has not been the case for a few weeks.

Correct. The 'set and forget' objective is being achieved by the use of the Expert Advisor which is making the implementation of this strategy even simpler than originally expected. Many thanks to pr1mer !

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
Yes, unless you do not use an MT4 broker. Let's just say that I know a great deal aboui the inner workings of MT4, dealing desks and some of the brokers that use them. Actually the EA makes the strategy more complex, not less.

What I may do is convert your EA into EasyLanguage for Trade Station. I am more comfortable with that product.

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
I only trade the EUR/USD using this system, but I chose not to set trades last night on this system because of consolidation, and either way it went, ran into S & R . It may take a day or 2 before it resumes some sort of trend, as this works better when it's trending, IMO.

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
I had the same results on my live account and both demos (IBFX & NF).  The EA should have set the SL on the EUR/USD once it hit +15.  It should not have gone back and hit a -30 SL on the other 2 positions.  I checked my settings and they are all set to 15 on update to break even.

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Same result for me.  I do not know why the other 2 trades continued on for -30 pips each.  The stop losses were not moved up once the +15 pips hit.  Why does the EA sometimes fail us?

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
Can you place other manual trades in addition to using the EA on a live account.  I would like to live trade the EA, as well as placing other trades.  I just want to make sure that this is possible, and will not mess up the EA trades.  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
A while back I was baffled as to why all and any trades I made, were set to break even after a few pips in my favor. It happened often enough that I finaly figured out that once any trades I entered made 15 pips, the SL was automatically set up to break even. It probably saved me some money, lol, but it also stopped me out of trades that would've been good trades. It was days before I finally figured out, that anytime this EA is running, then any trades I make, will be set to BE automatically after 15 pips.  Have any of you had this happen?

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
Hi Longboard.

If you know a great deal about the inner workings MT4, dealing desks and some of the brokers that use them, if you share your knowledge on this thread I'm sure we'd all be extremely grateful.

If you can present a better alternative and consider EasyLanguage for Trade Station to be it, I'm sure we'd all be grateful if you shared that as well.

I'm always open to improvement.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Yep, very similar.

I switched my internet connection to a new computer today and have dowloaded a new demo account for the EA, so I can only go by a papertraded result for EURUSD. I therefore did not share the experience of the EA not moving the stop to BE after the 1st PT was reached.  EJ and UJ got their results earlier in the session, before I started the switch. As I type, either EU has reached the 1st PT with the remaining 2 orders stopping out at BE, or all 3 orders have stopped out at 1.4862.

For my posted results I'll most likely take the conservative approach and adopt the latter and hope that future positive results compensate.

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
Go to the Forex conventions.  Work for a broker sometime. It is quite eye-opening, let's just say. Or be a director of the IT function. Yes programs exist to pick off stops. Risk of Ruin on average for a small forex account (<$1000) exceeds 95%. Most firms are highly undercapitalized. But this is a different topic. And the unstated goal is for them to pocket your money, as the "casino" versus the "gambler". But everybody knows this already, it is nothing new.

As to "Easy-Language", I like the product better because simulation results have been much better for me than those using EAs. And perhaps my bias against MT4 has more to do with the brokers that offer it than it does with the actual coding syntax. I'll see what I can do.

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
I am not sure!  I have not tried other trades (manual) while the EA is running.  That is my question - can I place other trades while EA is running.

Hi,

I wonder if anyone who knows his/her way around EA work can screw around with the 30 SL.  Maybe try 40....50....greater??

Keep seeing SL trigger then move in right direction.

These pairs subject to big draw-down, but generally move in the direction which they've been told to go....eventually.

Good luck.

Your results look odd to me.  The EUR/JPY should have moved the 2nd and 3rd orders to break even after the 15 made its profit.  Also your SLs are all different.  If you went with the defaults you would have ended up being +20.

EUR/USD +15, +30, +50 (95 pips)

EUR/JPY +15, 0, 0 (15 pips)

USD/JPY -30, -30, -30 (-90 pips)

The EUR/CHF seems to be doing well in the 13-17 demos (140 pips).

I expect the totals for each account to remain negative since a lot of pairs wont work well but the 13-17 (columns D & E) accounts have some good numbers for the past 2 days.  It will be interesting to see how everything pans out after a month or two.

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
You may notice that I've removed any results for the EUR/GBP.  This is because it doesn't move much and was usually lagging behind.  From this point on I have removed the EUR/GBP chart from all demos.

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
Click on the chart then press the F7 key to call up the ea properties. Change the StopLoss to whatever you want.

I have noticed this as well, Peter, but hadn't got around to experimenting. I have now set all my sl's at 50 on the demo, to see what happens.

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
the performance is strong negative ??

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
I should clarify...  I am not talking about the totals for the accounts but rather the amount of green pairs and their numbers in those columns.

If I were to base my decision at this moment I would go with...

EUR/CHF 13-17 (140 pips on each account)

etc.

Of course this is only 2 days of trading so I wouldn't jump on that yet but I am looking to see where the darkest most profitable greens are in the chart and what was the demo/time frame it was run on.  I just meant that the 13-17 columns have more greens than other accounts did.

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
I had to close 6 orders manually today on one of the North Finance demos.  I can only assume it is poor performance on their end.  The AUD/CAD sell stops and the EUR/USD buy stops were left open after the opposites were already triggered and even long since closed.

Maybe there could be something added to the EA to make sure the orders are actually closed if there happens to be a lag and the orders don't close the first time?

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
The EA is not moving the Trailing stop correctly when one buy order hits the TP.

Ex - Today the first order hit the TP for 15 pips bit still the next 2 orders hit the SL for -30 pips each.

Is there a settings i should tweak or the code..

Thanks for any help

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
Hi Mtaboneweb,

Based on your results across various brokers - and using the contrarian nature of the markets (i.e. an initial breakout is often followed by a reversal before the market moves off in the direction of the breakout),

.....why not reverse the way the EA takes trades and set sell orders on the upside and buy orders on the downside?????

I appreciate you only have a few days of data - but I think we will find that many pairs, such as the AUD/NZD, will continue to produce false breaks.

(After all the system has been narrowed down to trading only three pairs - so this may suggest that for the majority of pairs the contrarian approach may be better in the long run).

Food for thought?

Tim

I am not quite sure which is the latest version of the EA. And in subsequest posts it looks like something is wrong, anyway. Before I start ripping it apart, I will wait for you all to figure it out.

I might just start writing something fresh, however.

Also, I am  convinced this is just a trending strategy. Why not just go with

a switch that turns this strategy on an off, given trending indicators?

And why limit yourselves to the profit of 95 pips in GBPCHF (assuming that one used this EA to trade it today)?  You could have done much better than that.  Check out the "key to the Mint" post.

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
I think it's an excellent idea.  Would the original programmers like to make reverse EA versions?  I could always make the change as well if they are busy.  I think it's worth trying it.

What I may do is drop the NF demos since I have had some issues anyways.  I could run three additional IBFX demos under the same parameters but with reverse orders.

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
Here it is...

I have modified and tested to make sure orders are opposite and it works.  I can post the others in the next day or so if anyone is interested.

I will finish out the week with my current testing and then add the Reverse demos for IBFX and remove the NF demos at the start of next week.

New demos for IBFX reverse tests are 22-17, 13-17, and 08-17.  All the settings are the same except orders are reversed.

Will repost when bug is fixed.  See post 1169.

The bug has been fixed as of 11/29.  This EA is good and will now close pending orders when a Sell Limit or Buy Limit is triggered on the same pair.

This scenario presents another consideration apart from pip gains in determining the success of this system in a live trading environment.

Hi mtaboneweb,

Thanks for setting up a reverse EA.  It will be interesting to test out.  I notice that you have set it out with orders based at the original third TP point (i.e. 50 pips out).

However if you consider your results the majority of failures occur when the entry orders are triggered and then the spot rate fails to go the 15 pips to the first profit level.  So I was wondering if you wouldn't mind setting the reverse system with the sell entry orders at period high +5 (as per Mikes rules) not +50, and the stop at period high +20 ...and the opposite for the buy entry orders below the low for the period chosen.

I was keen for a stop at high +20 since most of the failures come from price action not moving the additional 15 pips to the first profit level (above the high+5 breach point).  In this way we can minimise the loss and maximise the gain - since we will have the three profit levels still in place (for the breach of the high +5 pips, these would then be at high-10 pips, high-25 pips, and high-45 pips).

So we are then getting really good risk reward ratios here also.  And we could still have the stop to BE when the first pull back level (high -10pips) is reached.

Spreads will have to accomodated also.

Tim

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
Hi Mike,

A suggestion for a price filter would be to only allow the EA to set trades for pairs that are less than 1.2x of the previous days ATR(10).  With this we would be ensuring that trades were not be set for days that followed very big moves since they are often prone to pullbacks the following day.

Several years ago I worked on a breakout system that took an entry at the open of the new day plus 70% of the previous days ATR(10), and ran a stop of the open-50% of the previous days ATR(10).  TP was a time exit which we found best suited to 3 days out from trade entry.  (I am not the original system designer).

Results were good, but it would run several months in a row in DD sometimes (so it was best suited to the long term trader).  However we found that we could significantly improve the winning trades by including a price filter as I suggest above.

The logic being that breaches on days following a large candle day were much more susceptible to volatile whips as it made the breach of the previous days large range candle.

Maybe this could be considered for future versions of the EA as a possible filter to test??  (Possibly add as a variable to the inputs)

Tim

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
I read your post with interest, whilst following this thread. You say you downloaded 6 years data. I would love to have access to history as my prefered programming language would be rexx, so I need to run scenarios offline.

How can we download this data even if we have to pay?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
Hi Tim.

Interesting...you may like to discuss with our programmers the idea of adding such a filter as an option to a future version of the EA.

The trades are not being set +50 above or below the high or lows.  The EA still uses the "Margin" variable which by default is 5 and can be set to whatever you want.  I have run the EA on 18 pairs last night to test and the orders are placed exactly like the original except the orders are opposite.  Buys are set 5 below the previous low and sells are set 5 above the previous high.  They are not set +50 on either side but rather the 3rd TP level is 50 just like the original.  I believe changing the stop to less than 30 pips may be useful but can be set in the EAs settings rather than a hard coded default.

Spreads are considered when placing orders and the other settings can all be tweaked to whatever you like.

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
Here is a screen shot showing trades that were placed with the reverse EA.  You can see the SLs above and below the highs and lows and the TPs in between the Sell Limits and Buy Limits.  I think decreasing the SL from 30 to 20 is probably a good idea that timmy had but for now I am going to leave the defaults as they are.  All the settings can be tweaked for whatever your preference is.  Thanks again timmy for the fantastic idea to reverse the trades.

They expire after 18 hours.  You can change it in the settings.  See post 1167.

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
I know the trades have not all finished yet but I couldn't resist posting the results so far.  This is the 08-07 IBFX reverse results so far and the open trades.  Not all daily results will go this well but it will be interesting to see which pairs do well in which time frame.

Official testing will begin on Sunday for all 3 time frames that I have been testing and the NF demos will be dropped.

Note: AUD/USD & USD/JPY still have a good chance to hit their 50 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
I noticed that the AUD/CAD should have triggered  the buy limits but never went on my IBFX demo.  Twice it passed the buy limit within 3-4 hours of the pending orders being placed.  Now it is toying with the sell limits.

It would have been a big winner if the buys triggered like they should have.

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
OK - Thanks for the info.  Why do we not want the trades to go until 4pm or so?  I know that the EA sets the next day's trades at 5pm.  Please let me know.  Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
I'm not sure why they expire 18 hours later and how that became the default.  I'm sure Mikelath would know the answer.

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
I've had good results using the EA on the USD/JPY, EUR/USD, and EUR/JPY pairs (Tues - Thurs only which is limiting the DD and producing positive pips). Would it be possible for you to set up a Reverse EA for the FXDD platform? I'd like demo test it along side of my live trades for comparison.

Regards,

Sam

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
My plans are to make reverse EAs for all the existing ones.  I've only done the IBFX Fall version so far to see how it runs and it seems to be doing very well.  I will mod the others in the next day or so.

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
Looking forward to demo testing it.

Thanks,

Hi mtaboneweb,

Sorry you were right - I was not looking clearly at my orders when I made the comment about the settings.  They are setting up correctly as you state.

My platform also missed the two chances for entry on the buy limits - and has since taken the sell limits and made a loss.  It should have been a big gain.

Also the EA left orders on for the buy limits on the USD/CAD and sell limits for the NZD/JPY ....don't know why these weren't removed.

And I currently have the AUD/NZD active for sells but again the EA has not cleared the buy limit orders???

But from your results (and mine if AUD/CAD had had orders properly actioned), we would have had a nice result.

Can you look at the EA to find out why orders are not cancelling - or am I missing something in my set up??

Thanks for all your programming effort - it is much appreciated.

Tim

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
Thanks for your support.  The orders were left open due to a bug which I have fixed and updated the original post with the fixed version.

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
Mtaboneweb,

Thanks for that.

Did you manage to find out why the AUD/CAD did not trigger when it should have?

Tim

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
Here are the modified EAs which will place the orders in reverse.

I noticed while modifying the code that the "void start()" seems to differ a bit from one to the next.  I am sure they are all different due to the different brokers but the NF version seems to be very extreme from the others.  No cause for alarm, I would just like PipHunter196 to maybe confirm the changes that were made in that area.

The reverse EAs are the same as the Fall EAs except the place sell limit orders at the high for the day and buy limit orders at the low for the day.  They reverse which orders are placed at the high and low.  Everything else is the same.  The idea is that some currencies may go to a low or high and bounce back to the middle rather than breaking out of the high/low.  I will begin testing this for the 3 time frames next week listed below:

08-17 (start hour-look back hours)

13-17

22-17

Here is the other half.

--- 帖子 #1184 ---
I didn't find anything but it was a bummer.

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
Here are the results for the 08-17 time frame.

If the AUD/CAD had triggered the buy limits like it should have then the results would have been another +95 pips instead of -90 on the SL for the sells.  I am still not sure why it missed that.

--- 帖子 #1186 ---
What is the reverse EA?  Are you no longer using the Fall EA?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
Mtaboneweb,

Are these versions the same as the bug free versions for IBFX in post #1158?

Thanks

Tim

--- 帖子 #1190 ---
The IBFX version is the same except for an updated comment that is added to the orders.  The comment shown in the attached picture is a mod that I made to the original EA.  The example means:

11/30 - 0(950017)

Date the order was placed.
Start hour
This is the magic number (95 for Daily 95, 00 for start hour, 17 for look back hours)

I did this to help me sort things out once I save the detailed reports but you have to display the comments in the history tab to see them in the detailed report.  If an order is placed on 11/29 then it may not be triggered until 11/30 and the time would also change to when the order actually triggered.  It's just my way of preserving the initial information of the order.  I also change the magic number for each account (not currency) based on the start hour and look back hours.  My magic numbers are 950017, 951317, and 952217 to match my settings on each demo account.

The reverse comment would come out looking like this: 11/30 - 0 R (950017)

This will help me distinguish the trades further if I ever run a reverse and regular EA on the same account.

The EAs are compiled with their original magic numbers so you will need to change them manually if you would like it to be different.  It's one of the settings in the EA properties window.  For my demos I loaded my first chart and set everything the way I wanted it (i.e. magic number, fixed lot size, start and look back hours).  I then saved it as a template and applied that template to each chart I opened from that point forward for that account.  Just a time saving tip.

The magic number needs to be unique for each currency in a single account.  That means if you have 2 EUR/USD charts and the same EA attached then each should have a unique magic number like 952217 and 951317 if I were running both time frames on the EUR/USD with 2 charts on the same account.  I can have the same magic number if the currencies are different like if I was using the EUR/USD and some other pair(s) on the same account.

When the EA checks to see what it should do it loops through all the orders on your account and looks for those that match the symbol (i.e. EUR/USD) and the magic number.  I am over explaining for the benefit of anyone who has questions about what the magic number is used for and why it's important to an EA.  If anyone has questions or feels that I have confused the issue by over explaining please let me know.

Anyways, long story short, I forgot to add the "R" in the comment when I compiled it for the original post.  If you have to have the "R" then you will want the version from the most recent post.

Hi All

I have been reading this thread for a few months now and demo trading it myself, i would like to thank Mike and everyone who has helped... Mike its great to see other aussies having a go at this stuff too!! (even if you are a banana bender hehe)

My broker has a differnt platform to mt4, so i got a NF demo and now have mt4, so i think im going ok, i have the happy face in the top right hand corner of the chat.

Just two questions if i may.

Do i now need to leave the chart open and running at the turn of the day so the EA will activte?

In the EA properties the first 2 things it lists are fixed lots and risk, maybe im being a bit of a himbo but do i use both of these settings or just one?

It really is a shame my other brokers platform wont use EA'S but thats life!

Thanks again guys and girls

Am sorry if it sounds disturbing but am just a newbie who needs help on the trading strategy and like to gain experience cos i know you have been using it on demo.pls waiting for reply

--- 帖子 #1194 ---
Hi Rasaqdayo

Mike has been good enough to keep the rules in post 1 up to date, so if you just follow the rules in post 1 you will be as up to date as the rest of us

An EA is an expert adviser and really all it does is set the trades for you automatically staying true to the set and forget idea (but to use the ones on this thread you need meta trader 4)

Best of luck my friend and if i can be of help please dont hesitate to ask!

11/29/2007 Daily Completed Results

Not a good day for the 22-17 time frame.  A lot of orders never triggered and the ones that did lost.

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
11/25/2007 - 11/29/2007 Total Completed Results

As we look at the ongoing and daily results we need to remember that each time frame should come close to matching each other.  You can see the 08-17 time frame differs a lot between brokers (IBFX -2485 / NF -1920).  Look at the AUD/USD as an example (IBFX -85 / NF +155).  That's a big difference but in the 13-17 time frame the EUR/CHF did better on IBFX.

This week is difficult to make any quick judgments.  Normally the 3 pairs do well but not this week so far.  The GBP/CHF has done well this week but may not on a week when the other 3 pairs are doing better.  Also, the EUR/CHF has done very good in the 13-17 time frame although better on the IBFX demo.

I can't really say why the demos are so different.  I'm not sure if it could be lag due to running so many pairs on so many demos all at once on my computer or something else.  Highs and lows will vary from one broker to another and that could be part of it.  The extra lag that I've noticed with the NF demos may actually play a part in those demos doing slightly better and yet I feel that lag is not a good thing in trading.  Where it might have played a beneficial part this week may not be the case next week.  The IBFX 22-17 was the only one that had higher numbers overall.

We should really start to pick these charts apart and see what sense we can make of it.  As the weeks pass the picture will hopefully become clearer.  I do feel a single week is too short a time to make any decisions.

As for next week I am unsure what to do.  Do I stop the NF demos and run the reverse demos on the 3 time frames on IBFX demos?  Do I continue as is to get a clearer picture not only between time frames but brokers as well?  Could there be a problem running so much at once on a single computer?

I do believe we should start testing the reverse because all of the negatives above could have been potential positives and that is encouraging.  I wonder how the reverse will do on a week that supports break outs on the original 3 pairs.  Are certain pairs more likely to break out rather than rebound?

Any thoughts?

My broker is ODL and I have the EA version for ODL (fall & 0.4).

I am trying to optimize the system.

By that I mean that I want to determine the high and the low of each day between 4AM to 8AM GMT and not from 23:00 or 00:00 backwards 17 hours).

My questions are:

11/25/2007 - 11/30/2007 Total Completed Results

Check out the EUR/CHF with a total of +1075 pips across all time frames and demos.  It would appear that 13-17 or 22-17 may be a good time for the EUR/CHF.

Mikelath,

Was the EUR/CHF part of your initial testing before you got down to the 3 you are using now?

To all,

Notice the difference between the 08-17 demos on the GBP/CHF and the GBP/JPY.  The IBFX demo took a beating while the NF demo took off for a great positive.  Then on the EUR/CHF did better on the IBFX demo although both were very good for the week.

I think it may be important to continue testing like this for another week or so before I decide which broker to cut. I plan to continue test all 3 time frames to see what time will tell about the pairs and which ones are good where.

I'm not sure about the Reverse version because it would be too much for my computer to run 9-12 demos.  I will see what I can do because I would actually like to do the same test on the reverse (3 IBFX demos, 3 NF demos on the 08-17, 13-17, and 22-17 time frames).

Hiya Bob.

My understanding is that your computer must be turned on for the duration within the week that you would like the EA to function for. From what I can gather, the EA is attached to and functions from your computer, not the broker.You would therefore need to have the hibernate option switched turned off in the screensaver section of the control panel. The reason for this is twofold:

1. To ensure that the computer is on when the EA is due to calculate the new orders for the day.

2. To ensure that the computer is on to manage any open trades ie. executing profit targets and stops.

As for whether you need the trading platform to be constantly open for the EA to still work, I'm not 100% sure. Personally, I keep the trading platform open for the whole week (Sunday night to Saturday morning Brisbane time)and minimise it while I do other stuff on the computer.

If you are running the NF fall version the default settings are set to the 'standard' rules of the D95P strategy as per post#1. If you are happy with these settings then you don't need to change a thing. Pr1mer has programmed the EA to calculate order sizes based on a % of the account balance, thus achieving the desired money management objective. He has included a word doc with instructions outlining each setting ( sorry, I can't remember which post it's at ). The only difference between Pr1mer's latest version of the EA and PipHunter's fall EA's is that piphunter has adjusted the DayStartHour to suit numerous brokers who start the day at different times, thus making it easier for newbies unfamiliar with how to adjust the input settings on the EA. I'm immensely grateful to both of them.

It is however not all doom and gloom as +455pips for all 3 pairs over the past 4 weeks is still pretty good. The weekly average since inception is now +193pips.

"Check out the EUR/CHF with a total of +1075 pips across all time frames and demos. It would appear that 13-17 or 22-17 may be a good time for the EUR/CHF.

Mikelath,

Was the EUR/CHF part of your initial testing before you got down to the 3 you are using now?"

Actually, no it wasn't. Thanks for bringing this to the table. EURCHF may indeed be a contender.

The platform needs to be running as long as there are open orders or pending orders.  The EA has to be active to manage the trades as the charts tick.  It's what is responsible for moving the stop loss to break even after +15 is achieved, trailing stops if chosen, etc.  It also closes the opposite trades.  The system would not produce good results without this maintenance of the orders.

Mike a still with a loss in my ibfx fall version that started 11/01.

do you run a demo of that version too? there is much diferent results?

i opened yesterday Piphunter account and looks like he started to run the EA again. But i could not found new posts here.

i hope he returns  and make a new version more close of the manual method.

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
Yes, why?

Hi everybody - as always - thanks for the input and the hard work - you know who you are...

I am wondering if anybody has tried starting their orders, whether live or not, at the open of Tokyo market? If so, what have been the results?  In my IBFX live account (using teeny, tiny lots)  there seems to be a lot of price volatility when the volumes are thin.  This would seem to lead to more - saying this nicely - market manipulation.

I don't know if the thin volumes are working for us or against us.

2nd item - With the reversing - here is another thought.  Again, on days where we have had a big move in the market and the close is near the top or the bottom of that big move, the market always have a tendency to do some retracing.  We have the problem of orders getting triggered and then stopped out with this retracing. I believe this is being addressed with the reverse changes made in the EA.

The second piece of this puzzle is the fact that the opposite order is set way on the other side of this big move.  For example, let's say a pair moves 200 pips up in a given day.  Before our sell orders are triggered, the market would have to retrace the entire 200 pips plus 5 more (or whatever number you are using)  before our sells would be triggered.  Way into this 200+ pip move, the tide has obviously turned.

I have seen in several different places, the use of a calculation to determine when the market momentum has reverse.   The term used I have seen most is 'pivot point'.  The calculation of the pivot point is easy enough:

(Previous Period Close + Previous Period High + Previous Period Low) / 3

Most of you are far more experienced and smarter than I am, do you think a pivot point +or- 5 pips on the day after a big move might yield more pips?

Comments and input please....

I've started testing the Reverse EA on my FXDD demo platform. My thoughts are most probably to use the Reverse EA on Sunday and Monday and the 95Daily EA Tues - Thurs.

However, we are coming up upon the holidays. That being the case, the market volume tends to get thinner around Dec. 15 - Jan 15 area as most institutional traders are on vacation. If the Fed's cut interest rates (enough) on Dec. 11th we may see some trending movement among the pairs. Again, however, at some point the holiday volume will take over.

The Reverse EA may work perfectly during the above time period.

Any thoughts?

Sam

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
This strategy would probably work well with the JPY, GBP, and some of the other high movers. Are you just thinking to t/p at the pivot point?

I use pivot points in my trading. Wouldn't the language need to include (and I am not a programmer, so I hope you understand my gibberish) something to the extent of = if moves past pivot (depending on direction) then t/p at Support 1 or Resistance 1, if moves past S1, R1, then t/p at S2, R2, etc.

And what about retracements? Especially from S3,R3?  - And I'd also think you'd have to add a TS.

Just thinking out loud.

Regards,

Sam

I reset the accounts on Sunday afternoon so there will be no trades for the 22-17 time frame for IBFX or NF.  Both placed trades improperly opening pending orders times 2, 3, 4, and even more on some currencies.  Somewhere in the roll over from Friday to Sunday the EA gets confused.  It most likely has something to do with when the time stops ticking on Friday and when it starts back on Sunday.  Even if I start the demos shortly after the market open on Sunday it initially places double, triple, etc. orders which I would have to manually close to get things evened out.  The 1st solution I can think of is to disable experts on the whole account before the market opens on Sunday and then re-enable them after the time gets itself worked out.  This is a temporary fix for now and it requires that you are in front of your computer on Sunday at market open.  Maybe our original programmers could take a look at the code?  Everything about this EA seems to be great except for this one Sunday bug.

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
That's a great thought.  It would take some work on the EA to add support for pivots but it could be done.  At this point however I was simply thinking in reverse of the original idea that playing on the bounce rather than the breakout may be profitable on certain pairs and/or certain time frames.  I would like to see how well it does under simple rules first before modifications are made to maximize more profits.  If it proves to be working well in certain areas then modifying it to work off of pivots could help to increase profit levels.

Results for today (using EA - live)

EUR/JPY -90

EUR/USD -90

USD/JPY - nt

Let's hope tomorrow is a better day!!!

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
My original thought was to use the pivot point +or- 5 pips as to where to trigger the order.  We are on the same page for S2, S3 or R2 and R3 as TP or SL points.  My concern was that I might be getting the cart before the horse because I really don't have a lot of experience using the pivot points.

As far as which pair to use pivot points on - I think it would be applicable to all of the pairs.  We would just have to define how big a daily move would need to be in order to use the pivot point logic instead of the 'normal' logic.

Again - all input is appreciated...

Tim

BTW Samantha - love the Proverb's quote - one of my favorites...

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
same result for me

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
I only trade one pair using this system, and that is EUR/USD. I do not however blindly use this system every day, but instead use discretion, and have had pretty good luck with it. I chose not to trade short today based on price being on the trend line. Yes, that trend line may be broken, but until it is, I decided not to trade, and saved myself 90 pips. When it's trending up, like it has been for years now, I only take long trades. Granted, we may be in for a bigger correction, and I may take short trades again, once the trend line is broken, and price is back in the bigger channel. I know in some cases, my discretion will be wrong, but it's just my personallity not to let an EA do "all" the trading for me :-)

--- 帖子 #1221 ---
Hi -

I think your idea is ideal for large movements, only problem I can see is the variables that occur with pivot trading (they drive me crazy). The currency pair doesn't always head to say the S3/R3 levels after it reaches the S2/R2 level, it may head back to the S1/R1 level, etc.. It isn't so cut and dried and a trailing stop is almost always necessary. Risk may be in the TS?

I have a Metatrader Pivot Point & Fibo indicator which shows highs and lows and a couple of take profit levels - it's simple and effective.

I use it on my 1 hour chart. I am attaching it just in case your would like to review it to see if it could be somewhat adapted or help in developing an EA.

I also understand what mtaboneweb is saying - perhaps we need to wait a while and test the reverse EA. Too bad we can't clone him.

Yep, good proverbs quote - ain't it the truth?

Let me know if the indicator helps.

Sam

I just wanted to let everyone know that the demos are still running and seem to be doing just fine.  It has become difficult for me to post daily results but I will definitely post entire weekly results and the on-going overall results at the end of each week.  I am glad to say that Vensik has offered to help in the testing of the reverse versions of this EA.  He has been running demos that match what I am doing but in reverse since Sunday.  The results are being posted to a website were I can retrieve the information and throw it into my spreadsheet so we can start to see how it's panning out.  So at the end of each week I will post the weeks results and on-going results for the regular EA and reverse.

I have also modified my spreadsheet to show how many days/trades have been placed and the average per day.  The amounts are the entire trades divided by 3 since 3 trades are triggered at a time.  You can see in the picture that the AUD/CAD is "5 (-69)" which means that it was triggered 5 days (15 trades total) and the average pips is -69.   Here is an update of last weeks data.

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
Is anyone having problems with the Fall EA NOT moving the S/L back to break even after the first 15 pips is achieved?  Mine HAS NOT done it in a few days.  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
I have also had that problem on the IBFX and NF versions of the EA.  Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.  Being that I am running so much at once I can't say if it's lag, an EA problem, or even a broker problem.  I will look at the code to see if there might be a potential problem.

For some reason my EA  -  USDJPY pair results were : (+15,  -30, -30).  The EA did not move stop loss up on remaining 2 trades after +15 was hit )-:  Does anyone know how to fix this EA problem?

--- 帖子 #1229 ---
EA seems to have problem pushing the TS and i see some the profits you showed doesn't happen with EA

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
Hi folks.

I've noticed that some are experiencing that the EA is not adjusting the stop to BE after the 1st (or 2nd) PT has been reached. I personally have not had this experience lately (it may have happened before) and I have no idea why it's happening for some of us now. You may want to contact Pr1mer for a possible explanation.

Just to be clear; I am now posting results provided only by the EA running in a NF demo. If the EA doesn't calculate and place orders for either side due to price being too close I am accepting that there may not be a trade for that day. I am using the 'standard' settings as per post #1. This includes not using a trailing stop.

Happy pipping.

Any thoughts/ideas?

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
This may seem like a stupid question or perhaps a simple one.  But are you sure you have the Expert Advisor Button ON?  I have had a similar problem in the past when I logged into a different account, and then back again.  Only I forgot to start up the Advisor again, and I had those results ...

Ken

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
I can't imagine how it would even place the trades in the first place without the Expert Advisors being enabled.  Unless you switch accounts in between when the trades are placed and when the SL should be modified.  There is a setting in the options not to disable EAs when switching accounts although it's not advisable to uncheck it.  Also, you are leaving MetaTrader open with the charts open and the EA's attached and enabled, correct?  The MetaTrader, charts, and EA's all need to be in place and running in order for the EA to do maintenance of any orders after they have been triggered.

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
Yes, EA ON..NOT a stupid question.  Apparently, some others, in this forum, are experiencing EA issues with IBFX.  Thanks for your concern, though!!

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
How do you leave EA on through the settings?  When that is set that way, can you MANUALLY turn off the EA on top of the chart?  Does the MagicEA Number have anything to do with it?  All my MagicEA numbers are the same (i.e. same for each of the three pairs I trade)???

--- 帖子 #1236 ---
Some of the issues I've had with this EA are below:

1. If the pending orders have been placed and you close and re-open MetaTrader while it's still within the hour to place the pending orders, then it places another set of pending orders.  The EA doesn't do a good job of checking to see if pending orders have already been placed.  The EA needs to check things out before it opens pending orders.

2. If you have double pending orders for a currency and one direction is triggered only 3 of the opposite trades are canceled leaving 3 others that could be triggered later in the opposite direction.  Double orders shouldn't happen in the first place but the EA should still be able to handle this situation.

3. If it turns out that moving the SL to BE is a lag issue where the broker somehow turns the order to modify down then the EA should re-try on the next tick of the chart until it can be set.

I also think that there should be an option in the EA to say true/false for directly opening orders if the currency is too close to the high/low to place pending orders.  In this case it would place direct trades in that direction and not even bother setting pending orders in the opposite direction.  Suggestions have been made to place x amount of pips even higher or lower but I feel if you're going to set it that close in the first place then you might as well get in sooner and have a better chance at your TP.  If you set it 5 above or below then you will most likely hit that anyways and you've already lost an additional 5 pips already in that direction.

Another idea... Has anyone considered setting the +50 TP's stop loss to +15 once the +30 TP order has hit.  In this case if you hit +15 and +30 and your +50 never happens then you would still have +15 for a total of +60 if it only went as far as the +30 marker instead of falling all the way back to 0 leaving you with +45 instead.  I realize that moving a SL up would possibly decrease the possibility that the +50 might have enough room to hit +50 but it does ensure more of a profit if it never makes it all the way.  I would rather take +15 more on the last order rather than wait for +50 which may not happen.  This may leave to small of a window for the maximum profit.  It could be added as a true/false setting in the EA.

Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #1237 ---
The magic number is not the issue as long as they are different pairs.  The EA looks for a match of the magic number and the symbol for the chart it's running on.

Under the options menu there is an Expert Advisor tab.  The 2nd and 3rd checkboxes from the top are what I'm talking about.  Allow live trading does not need to be checked here as long as it is checked on the EA's settings on the chart.

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
Thanks a lot.  I like the idea of taking the extra +15 pips on the final 50 pips of profit (if necessary).  Then, why do you just set a trailing stop on the third order?  Some pips is better than zero (or negative pips)!!  Ideas??

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
If you are using an expert advisor and having problems you may consider calling your broker and making sure they are aware you are running a trading script.

I know EA trading is able to be disabled by MT4 brokers server side, some brokers open your account and disable EA trading until you request it on your account.

Obviously it is able to make the trades, but if we can't find the problem in the script maybe something needs to be changed server side to allow a script to change an open order.  It's atleast worth a phone call.

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
Thanks for the idea, but until a few days ago, the EA was working perfectly.

--- 帖子 #1241 ---
I forgot about the trailing stop, that's a good point.

Another silly question about your BE problem... Do you have it set properly in the EA's settings?  I know you say it was working fine but you may check to verify it is still set to 15.

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
YES, it is set to 15.  Re: Trailing stop...if I wanted this ON the third order, I was change FALSE to TRUE, correct?  Also, I could adjust the default from 20 to whatever, correct?  Why did Mikelath turn this feature off?  Are we better off taking a chance (leaving it off) to get the full 50 pips?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
I'm not sure why the default is false.  I can only assume it was an after thought (not part of the original system) that was added later.  This way anyone who wanted to use it could.

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
Do you use the trailing stop (TRUE) or leave it off (FALSE)?  It seems that it would make sense to use it, so we can achieve some extra profit. Make sense?

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
It does make sense although at this point I am not using it.  I am simply beta testing the system in it's original form for now to see how it does.  I have it split between 2 brokers right now to see which does better and have added a couple of alternate times to start.  In the end I guess when I started using it live I may very well decide to use the trailing stop.

As a side note the North Finance demos seem a little laggy compared to IBFX but the North Finance demos have better overall results.  The orders for the most part seem to be comparable between the 2 brokers but they definitely perform differently.  I am leaning towards using NF on a live account but I only have an IBFX live account at the moment.

Being that I'm in the US does anyone have an opinion about using a broker located outside of the US?  Anyone have real life (live) trading history with North Finance?

--- 帖子 #1246 ---
I wasn't going to post this early but I just couldn't wait.  I will post the completed week and completed history since start for my demos and the reverse demos early into the weekend.

The NF demos are killing the IBFX demos this week.  Overall pip differences are amazing.  I expected them to differ but not this much.

I will have to see how the reverse EAs performed at the end of the week.  Thanks again to Vensik for running the reverse EAs and supplying me with the results.

Note: The results below exclude any trades for the Sunday market open in the 22-17 time frame on IBFX and NF demos.  Things just got to screwed up when the market opened to fix it.

--- 帖子 #1247 ---
Here are the results since 11/25/2007.

The GBP/JPY on the NF account (08-17 EST) is really starting to stand out.  It has 8 days traded with an average of 56 pips per day.

Again you can really see the overall differences between IBFX and NF.

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
A guy from the daily20pip forum referred me to North Finance. He is a professional trader. His ID is mrkam. The link to the site is http://www.daily20pip.com/

In order to PM him you'll need to register and then enter the forum. He's quite active in most threads however does have some of his own.

Having had extensive experience he may be able to share the pros and cons that have formed his decision to go with NF.

I'm currently learning more about brokers...ECN's as opposed to marketmakers...anyway, this is another whole discussion in itself which we can address later...

Unfortunately, we hear different things from different sources, thus making it a challenge to arrive at a conclusive decision as to which broker is the best choice....in the meantime we can only really go by how effective the broker is in executing the trades the EA has placed...

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
I use IBFX not NF.  I have heard lots of bad things about using brokers in other countries.  It is bad enough that Forex brokers, in general, are somewhat shady.  NF, I believe is in Belize.  No thanks, I'll stay with a U.S. company.  Just an opinion.

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
These are all excellent ideas. I specifically agree with the Take Profit settings idea. This week alone, I had two trades on my FXDD platform which were +15, 0, 0. I would rather have the profit than not. Especially since we may be getting into the holiday doldrums soon.

Any chance we could take a vote? :-)

Sam

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
I've been placing my trades manually so all of the EA messages on here don't really apply to me. However, I was wondering why there is a difference in the performance of NF and IBFX. Is there two different strategies being tested here or is it the same strategy and the reason the results are different is because of problems with the broker? I know there has been alot of different things tested (trailing stops, moving to break even, etc.), just wondering if that was why there was a difference in results for the EAs.

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
I am currently testing 3 time frames on 2 different brokers.  All the settings are the same for each time frame for each broker.

I'm having decent results with the daily pips EA with the EUR/JPY also but I want to make sure I have it set up correctly. I hope someone will answer my question. For the North Finance EA NF is gmt +2. So does this mean I have to have the time set to 22 hours and not 0 hours? Thank you, Paris

On a North Finance account you would set the start time to 0 which is equal to 22 GMT.

HI ALL,

I am very new to this thread and Forex Factory. I read this thread and its very Interesting, but I am bit confuse as I am new to Forex.

Mikelath you said that

Use the high and low of the previous 17hrs. For Mondays orders go back as far as 00:00 EST on Friday for high and low.

by this you mean high and low of only 17th hr or of the whole day. My understanding is that open 1 hr chart at 17:00 and look for high and low of for that hour only is that correct ?. I will appreciate any help on this.

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
I was curious to see how the EUR/CHF was going to do this week since it did so well last week but it was too close several times to place the pending orders.  It didn't do 1 single trade on the NF 13-17 account.

The AUD/JPY did very well in the 08-17 and 13-17 time frames.

The EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY did well on the NF 08-17.

Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
Hi leo9 and welcome to the D95P thread.

Yes, the strategy uses the high and low of the previous 17hrs from 5pm EST (which is 17:00 by 24hr time). So we are using the high and low of practically the whole day(17hrs), not for that hour only. Monday is the exception as weekend activity is often minimal, therefore we use the data going back to midnight Friday morning.

I suggest that you simply use the Expert Advisor to automate the trading of this strategy. If EA's are new to you then just ask for assistance and we'll guide you from there.

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
Again, not much on the EUR/CHF due to price being to close to set most pending orders this week.

AUD/JPY and GBP/JPY both are doing well in the 08-17 time frame.

I finished this up a couple of weeks ago, this is for the EUR/JPY only.  This is a great strategy if you are in the market at the right times.  This strategy will result in huge 4000+ pip draw downs.  The rules used in the back test mirror Mike's original post.  It looks like right now may be a decent time to be in this strategy.  Good luck

Hi All

Firstly a big thanks to mikelath for sharing this system and results and thanks to all other regular contributors for helping it develop.

I have been following the thread for some time now and testing manually for the last 2 weeks. I am using the GFT broker at the moment so cannot use any of the posted ea's.

I am in the GMT timezone and I have been placing my orders at 8am gmt with a 24hr look back. I think the 24hr lookback is important as I want to include moves from the start of yesterdays London session as part of my daily range.

Apart from that the strategy is as per page 1 of the thread. I have been moving the stop loss of the 3rd (50 pip target) trade to breakeven when the 2nd target is hit.

I have only been using 2 pairs with results (for 9 days) as follows:-

GBP/USD = +105

EUR/JPY = +330

I can post the spreadsheet if required.

Pretty impressive and in correlation with Mike's results.

I am currently reading Kathy Lien's book titled 'Day trading the currency market' within which there is chapter titled 'best time to trade for individual currency pairs. You can find this chapter here:-
http://mediaserver.fxstreet.com/Repo...2d0fa4a83f.pdf

The problem with this data is that it is somewhat out of date. If anyone knows where there is an up to date source i would be interested.

I am woundering if targeting the session and pair combinations with the highest ranges would improve profitability.

I am also wondering if the profit targets and stop losses could be adjusted based on the avergage pair and session range. e.g. for big ranges increase the orders to s/l = -40, tp1 = 20, tp2 = 40, tp3 = 60 and use smaller targets for pairs and sessions with smaller ranges.

These ideas are up for discussion and I would be interested in the thoughts of others.

I will probably look to manually test this theory going forward.

Good luck all

I am a little confused. When would you execute the breakout EA and when would you execute the reverse EA?

Or would you execute both and see both buy and sell kick in at, say, yesterdays' high, or one to be stopped out?

Any help appreciated.

I use Solid Gold as a broker. Would it be possible for me to change an existing EA to run for this broker as a complete novice?

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
Hi endroute, Thanks for your work. Can you re-run the back test you did with rules reversed...Sell at high +5 pips,and Buy at low -5 pips? Pippo

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
hi endroute,

thank you very much for your graph, i guess this shows that the strategy is probably game over now, or what do you guys think?

do you also have graphs for other currency pairs?

would love to hear other opinions on those 5 year backtest results.

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
Endroute,

Thanks for the analysis you did on the ej. Would it be possible for you to run another analysis on the ej with perhaps a different time frame such as PipNick suggested (different results might be achieved):

"8am gmt with a 24hr look back"

This might help us all find the most profitable time frame.

Regards,

Sam

I do not think that anyone thins it's "game over."  You are going to have losing days, weeks, etc.  It is all part of trading!

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
but losing over a timeframe of 2 years, resulting in a negative result for the last 5 years??

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
Which EA has worked best for IBFX mt4?

--- 帖子 #1275 ---
I wasn't able to download the chart. It showed negative results over 5 years? Also, how does everyone think this system will work tomorrow with the Fed's decision? Would it be a good day to stay out of the market? With a strategy like this where you straddle the market, I think it would work fine. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #1276 ---
Reverse results for the 1st week seem to be very positive.  I would like to see how they do over time and then we can consider tweaking.

My thanks again to Vensik for running these demos.

--- 帖子 #1277 ---
I think it's good for people to experiment with different ideas on this strategy.  That's exactly what I'm doing.  At this point I am just keeping it simple and close to the original idea that started this thread.  I would also like to say that I believe back testing has proven to be flawed more often than it has been correct. I would not discourage anyone from running a back test and sharing but I would also ask that people don't jump ship just because someone got bad results in a back test. I am of the thinking that the only good way to test is with forward live testing.  Even under a great model quality in back testing is never more than 90% and live testing almost always proves to differ from back testing.

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
This is how I look at the results.

AUD/JPY in red did great with the original EA under the 08-17 TF and poorly under the reverse EA.  They are extreme from each other and I have begun running this pair in this TF on my live account.

Same for the GBP/JPY on the NF account although I'm not running this because my live account is IBFX.

I haven't decided which broker to go with yet but I have looked at the results and chosen to run some of these live on my IBFX where those IBFX demos did well.  My rules for running have been loose so far but I generally look for high days and average numbers to qualify running.

AUD/JPY has 9 days traded with an average of 37 pips which I feel is pretty good and the reverse just helps to support that so far.  I'm sure over time thing may change and I plan to run the demos for a long time to come while adjusting my pairs I trade live as the results become clearer.

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
Hi all,

As a newbie I would like to test your system/systems on a demo account . But having read some 30+ pages i am starting to get somewhat confused as regards which is the latest downloadable EA for this strategy minus the bugs.

plus what is the REVERSE EA all about ? plus has bksujal (who seems to have vanished) got a separate EA or has it been integrated into the daily95pips method ?

can any one help ?

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
If you click the paper clip near the top of the page you will find a complete list of all attachments.  If you then scroll down to Nov. 3rd you will find the versions of this EA that I'm using.  You will need to choose the right version based on your broker and then copy the file(s) to your experts directory.

I have also taken these EAs and reversed them in functionality.  This means that sells are placed at the 17 hour high and buys are placed at the 17 hour low.  Vensik is running demos with these EAs for us.  The reverse EAs were posted on Nov. 30th.

I have been posting results for my testing with Interbank FX and North Finance demos.  For each of these brokers I am running the EA on 18 different pairs with different start times.  I am running them starting at 8 gmt, 13 gmt, and 22 gmt on the IBFX accounts and the North Finance accounts get set 2 hours greater so they match the gmt time (10, 15, and 0).

Does this answer your questions?

Mike,

I don't have enough posts, so I can't PM you.  I would like to test this strategy on my blog, www.forexstrategytester.com.  If I understand correctly from the post above, the November 3rd EA is the correct one?  I just want to be sure before I start posting it.

Anyone that would like to stop by my blog and leave a comment or even just take a peak, I would greatly appreciate it.  I have worked hard to put it together.  There isn't a lot of content right now, but there will be by the end of the week.

100 pips is a great start to the week

Thank you for your help!

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
The reverse EA's are, in my opinion, more a study of the money management involved in this method than looking for some uber profitable rule set.  I find it interesting.

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
Hi Eleni and welcome to the D95P thread.

I'm flattered that you've chosen to include this strategy on your blog. Let's hope it does your blog justice.

You are correct in that Nov 3 is the most current EA.

This weeks results will be slightly off.  I don't usually run the 22-17 time frame on Sunday open due to issues with the EA but then I forgot to turn Expert Advisors back on to catch Monday's 22-17 time frame.  So the 22-17 results for this week will only be based on Tuesday through Thursday.

The results for 12/10 on the 08-17 and 13-17 time frames was amazing but I'm sure this wont happen often.  Anyways, I just had to post so everyone could see.

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
These are results running which EA on all pairs (Fall, Reverse?)?  Also,  what does 08-17 and 13-17 mean?  I am also curious to the results, as running the regular 3 pairs  (EUR/USD, EUR/JPY & USD/JPY) on the Fall EA has been bad lately.  Any advise?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
Sorry, these are results for the fall EA.

08-17 means start time of 08 GMT looking back 17 hours

13-17 means start time of 13 GMT looking back 17 hours

22-17 means start time of 22 GMT looking back 17 hours

Advise on which pairs can be answered by looking at my results I've been posting.  See post 1278 for the latest complete results for the previous week.

--- 帖子 #1288 ---
Thanks Mike!

For some reason I cannot get the EA to work for me

I am going to keep trying, but if anyone has any suggestions, that would be great.

Did I read somewhere that someone was testing it in reverse?  Meaning selling at the high and buying at the low?  Is there an EA for that as well?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1289 ---
Are you trading all pairs live? It appears that the 08-17 is a superior time frame.   The Fall EA is set to 22-17, correct?  Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
Click the paper clip and look for the EAs posted on Nov. 30th.

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
Here is my setup with the fall EA for IBFX and NF...

08-17 (London open)IBFX demo, 18 pairs, start hour set to 8 (Column B)

NF demo, 18 pairs, start hour set to 10 (8 GMT Column D)
13-17 (New York open)IBFX demo, 18 pairs, start hour set to 13 (Column F)

NF demo, 18 pairs, start hour set to 15 (13 GMT Column H)
22-17 (Original strategy)IBFX demo, 18 pairs, start hour set to 22 (Column J)

NF demo, 18 pairs, start hour set to 0 (22 GMT Column L)
The NF time is 2 hours greater than IBFX which is GMT time.  That's why the NF demos get set 2 hours greater.

Six demos testing 3 different start hours to compare which pair does good under which start time and then which broker did better than the other.

My results so far have been mixed showing certain pairs performing better with certain brokers.  Notice how the AUD/JPY produced 330 pips (9 days with an average of 37 pips) on the IBFX demo.  This pair did better than the North Finance demo under the same settings.  This could be due to lag, data stream, etc.

I have highlighted a few areas to point out some major differences that caught my eye.  Se the magenta highlighted area?  IBFX had 7 days it was triggered where the NF only triggered on 4 days.  This was due to the NF demo being too close to even set the pending orders so they were never made.  It show some differences between brokers because the IBFX demo had less problems setting the pending orders and then triggering them.

I use these results to pick out settings for certain pairs and possibly even certain brokers.

Are these results a benefit to anyone or should I keep it to myself?  I don't seem to get a lot of feedback from anyone looking at them except with questions about what they show.  I don't want to waste anyones time or create excessive posts when no one may be interested.

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
Hi mtaboneweb.

I for one am extremely grateful for the time and effort you are putting in with this thorough analysis.

As this is a forward testing exercise I'm sure I'm not the only one patiently awaiting the conclusive results at the end of a longer timeframe.

Keep up the fine work and I'm positive that it will prove worthwhile.

Is anyone out there still trading the EA (Fall) live?  It seems to have tanked the last 2 weeks, now this week as well?  I am puzzled why now, all of a sudden, it is doing so poorly.  Any ideas out there?

--- 帖子 #1294 ---
I agree with Mike.

Many thanks mtaboneweb, for your analysis.

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
this daily 95pips strategy seems interesting but i'm still testing so, no conclusion yet.

But what do u do when the current price of the market cannot allow you set entry orders due to the difference in current price and ur entry order price?

Also in a day like this, how do u set up this strategy (current price is far low from the low price in the 17th hr. Will it be okay to use the days low and high, regardless of the time they fall into?

--- 帖子 #1296 ---
need help with setting up the EA on my platform (North Finance)

--- 帖子 #1297 ---
I am trading live with .01 lots on an IBFX account although I have chosen different pairs/time frames that I'm running.  I looked at the results I've posted so far and went with the greenest pairs for IBFX.  My choice on a pair has to have higher days (7 or more) and a high average (25 or more).  I also look at the reverse results in deciding.

--- 帖子 #1298 ---
I am going to make some revisions to the EA for myself to go ahead and place the orders if they are too close to an extreme.  I can post the new version when complete and I have some other ideas I might implement at the same time.

So far pending orders get placed regardless and then they either get triggered or not.  I have seen cases where this turns out well and then again not.  If you're trading manually then I would say it's up to you.

If we could all predict where the price is going then we'd already be rich.

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
mtaboneweb, mike, et al.,

Thank you all for the contributions you make to our betterment in this difficult field.  I have been I little down on 4x as of late.  I feel much

better knowing there are individuals like yourselves that care.

Yes mtaboneweb, your charts are very very interesting and useful as are your conclusions about them!!

I have one question.It may sound stupid but I read few pages of this thread and I am very new to forex and after reading this thread I am bit confuse of weather we have to look at high and low of 17hr or high and low of everything till 17hr.

I mean that do u open one hr chart and look at 17:00 and look at high and low for that hour or you look at high and low for that entire session?.  Please let me know. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #1303 ---
You are looking back to see the high and low of the previous 17 hours.  If you use the EA (expert advisor), it is automatically done for you.  Good luck!

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
maybe a stupid question. The EA (ibfx fall version) need to be running 5pm or if i open  6pm it will try to open orders?

because yesterday it did not open any trades. i think it is because had any disconection or something like that.

and i would like to know if if anyone know another EA for this kind of strategie. I have Dayli Scalper EA too, but id like to test with another settings. For example changing the minimum pips after the breakout to open the orders.

thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #1305 ---
It needs to be running at 5pm

--- 帖子 #1306 ---
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE TERRIBLE? Am I mising something?

--- 帖子 #1307 ---
If I am in the US central time zone what is the 08 GMT start time ?

Also, do I put my time zone time in the ea or the GMT time zone.

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
I expected the results to be terrible for the most part.  That's the point of the testing.  If you look closely you will see there are some pairs that do well under certain start times.  Also, this is the reasoning for creating EAs that do the reverse to see how those results are.  This week in particular the 8 GMT just happens to be doing fantastic on a large number of the pairs.  The overall account balance and pips are positive which should raise the numbers.  You have to remember that the testing I'm showing is only since 11/25 and it will take a while for the true winners to start showing their colors.  I will post new results at the end of the week that show this weeks totals and the overall results.  You need to look for the greenest areas of the grid and pick you pairs and start times based on that.

--- 帖子 #1309 ---
If you are running an IBFX demo or real account then the time in the software is GMT time in which case you would set start time to 8 if you wanted 8 GMT.  Your own time zone should not affect the time shown in the MetaTrader software.  If you are going manual then you'll have to do some work to figure the difference between your time and GMT.  Since I run IBFX and North Finance demos they are different.  IBFX is GMT so I would set it at 8 in the EA settings.  NF is 2 hours ahead so I set that for 10 in the EA settings.  The point is you want it to be based on GMT 0 not + or - anything.

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
It needs to be running period.  It wont place pending orders or do maintenance to existing orders if it's not running with the EA attached to the chart and the EA enabled.  An EA cannot work unless the software is running.  I'm only stressing this because people seem to ask this question a lot.  Each time the chart is updated (tick) it fires the EA which applies the logic within itself and does any needed actions.  If it's not running then it can't do anything and you most certainly don't want to turn off the software after pending orders are placed.  The orders will become active when the price is reached but without the EA running it wont cancel the opposite orders, adjust stop losses once  pips is hit on the first order, trail stops if selected, etc.

--- 帖子 #1311 ---
Correct..I should have clarified.  Thanks mtaboneweb!

No problem, we're all working together here and that's a good thing.

Shabby results?  I do NOT think so!  Thanks Mikelath for starting this great thread.  I absolutely love this system. It is especially great for "setting it and forgetting it."  Takes the emotional/psychological side out of the equation...for the most part.  Let's keep plowing forward and making $$$$$$$$$!!!!

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
Please note that the 22-17 time frame only ran on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons.  I had complications on Sunday's open and then forgot to enable Experts on Monday.  Also, on the 13th I had a computer reboot for no apparent reason and found it later waiting for me to log in.  I'm not sure how long it was down but the trades were very light that day.

Almost all 3 IBFX accounts ended up with + pips this week which I think is amazing.  That means some big wins although I feel it's not going to be typical.

This weeks reverse results are not available at this time.  I will have to check with Vensik to see how we turned out.

--- 帖子 #1318 ---
My top choices are determined by high amount of days traded and high averages (20+).  I feel a 20+ average is respectable although anything higher gets better.

IBFX top choices are in green.

NF top choices are in cyan.

Thoughts?

Very early days, but 40 pips a day from 2 pairs is v good.

Good performance from GBP/USD which is interesting as this didn't give good results with the parameters used by Mikelath.

Perhaps there is something in my thoughts on post 1267. Time will tell.

Good luck all

Hi PipNick.

Very interesting results, particularly on GBPUSD which I axed very early from my initial list of 6 pairs. This goes to show that adjusting the parameters slightly can make a significant difference to the results. It's great to get such feedback.

--- 帖子 #1325 ---
I've been reading for the past several weeks emphasis on tweaking EA, which is fine. Those of us who don't mess with the EA possibilities are at a loss.

Also, I've the sense some are applying different rules into Mike's original.

What say we all share the different variations of Mike's rules & what works & what doesn't & try to put together a system format which works.

The results here are impressive. I've been trading on a demo, but in real time, for the past several weeks & got miffed a couple of weeks ago....so did the EA's

This thread shows what this forum is all about....Mike puts up the idea & everyone contributes & the system evolves from there. So, I propose that we circle the wagons, put forth what we've got, sort through it all, get everyone on the same page, and then turn everyone loose to get this system even better.

Thanks to you Mikelath & mtaboneweb especially, but the contributors on this thread....just really impressive.   Good work everyone!

Hi,

As a novice can i ask what may seem foolish to yourselves but not to me at this stage. This system is based on a set & forget basis eg set at time of trade , then leave and come back later hopefully with a bag of pips. So after setting the trades can i then turn off my PC + EA ? If so on  returning and switching back on the PC + EA will all calculations (profit totals) be inserted correctly ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1327 ---
You have to leave it running.  It is set and forget because the EA does all the work for you.  The EA is not only responsible for setting the pending orders but many other things as well...

Once a set of pending orders are triggered the EA closes the opposite orders.  If the buys are triggered then it closes the pending sells or vice versa.

Once the first 15 pips is achieved and that order closes at it's take profit then the EA moves the other 2 orders to break even on their stop loss.

If you have trailing stop enabled then the EA manages resetting the stop loss as the last trade moves.

All of these things would have to be done manually if it weren't for the MetaTrader platform and the custom EA that has been written to manage all of this for us.  Each time a chart is updated (tick) then the EA runs it's logic and does what is supposed to happen if anything at all at that point.  If the software isn't running and the chart isn't open and the EA isn't attached then the system cant to anything with the orders it placed.  Dozens of people ask this same question on nearly every thread here.  If you set your alarm clock and then unplug it will it go off when it's supposed to?  An alarm clock ticks throughout the day each time determining if it need to sound the alarm every second that passes.  It will not do it's thing if it's not powered on and EAs are the same way.  The broker does not do the work for you and when you set something like this up the logic behind the EA is not stored someplace magically and continues to run for you even after you close the software.  It requires that everything be in place and running, period.

Hi

I have been trying the system and had some variable results. I have several questions. First, I have some outstanding results that are sometimes cancelled by losses. Should I change my stoploss to a lower number?

Secondly, I am currently using the reverse IBX system. Is that the best one at present or should I but using another version? If so where can I download it.

Thank you for your help.

--- 帖子 #1329 ---
for you guys john w has posted his system on the holy grail found thread.... maybe you guys may want to read it..... it may help you perfect YOUR daily 95 system... eg john w has a tp of only 20 pips and he uses s/r levels and buy stop orders only.... if you read his thread and skunnys new thread you may have better success with less stress... just my 2 cents.... also nicotina has a great breakout strategy as well.... which could be adjusted with john w's iinsights.... anyway merry holiday to all good luck

--- 帖子 #1330 ---
For mike:

This is one of the most valuable system i have tested.

For everyone in this thread:

I have concluded that the system would work more accurate if price is not ranging on larger TF's, hence we have to look at the higher timeframes to make sure that we are in a correct trend.

Always remember that this system only works on trends, NOT SIDEWAYS, because in a sideway condition, price always bounce at support and resistance, before a breakout.

Consequently, always beware when currencies are on sideways on the higher timeframes. To help this, always draw trend lines for the higher TF's.

Just My 2 cents

--- 帖子 #1331 ---
Just curious and 1300 plus replies is too many to filter through...can anyone tell me is there is an EA for this method, and if so provide me with a link to it?? Thank you in advance

I actually just went to the attachments page and found 119 attachments in this thread. Any idea which EA is used for MT4 using the standard accounts as a feed??

--- 帖子 #1332 ---
Hi Colostarr.

Go the attachments page and scroll down to Nov 3. There will be 5 EA's to choose from corresponding to 5 different MT4 brokers.

Mikelath,

I use IBFX.

No trades triggered today.  2 of the 3 pairs - highs were to close and EA did not set trade for long trades.  In any event, nothing triggered that remained.

--- 帖子 #1335 ---
nice to see eur/usd got triggered and bank in some pips. Just wanna ask how your third TPing 50 pips got stopped out? SL @ BE? or trailing STOP? If it was trailing stop, how many pips did u set for TS?

--- 帖子 #1336 ---
SL @ BE.

--- 帖子 #1337 ---
Petro - I completely agree with this. Mike has kicked off the thread and others are doing their own research, developing ea's, throwing ideas around, etc. Exactly how a forum should be.

Lets all keep working together. At some point I am confident we will have the blueprint of a consistantly profitable system.

--- 帖子 #1338 ---
correction - i think we already have the blueprint (Mike's original post) - we are now just looking to prove and fine tune.

Mikelath,

Which EA are you running?  I am running the Fall IBFX EA.  Results, for today were:

EUR/USD - nt

EUR/JPY =15, -30, -30  (EA did not put orders 2& 3 to BE)

USD/JPY -90

Are you using a different timeframe?  Also, why do you use NF?  I am weary about opening an account to trade live offshore.  Advise?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1343 ---
Mike.

In your first post you wrote:
"There can be 4 possible outcomes after either the long or short trades are triggered:
....

3.) The first profit target is reached (+15pips) and the two remaining lots are stopped out for a total of -45pips."

But if you change your SL to BE when you reach your first order to 15 TP, how come you lose your other 2 orders?

--- 帖子 #1344 ---
I'm running the Fall NF EA in a NF demo account with all the 'standard' settings as per post #1.

I don't yet have a live account with NF so cannot comment. However, from what I hear from NFA reports on all the dodgy brokers out there it's hard to conclude who's going to be reliable and who's not. Only recently FXLQ who up until a certain point had an impeccable reputation were found to be engaged in malpractise. It's a tough call when any one of them could turn around and rip us off at any moment. Truth be told, the only broker I have any faith in is Dukascopy, and again that's only based on their reputation.

You are quoting a section describing the manual trading of this system without any further adjustment. Read on and you'll discover additional outcomes.

mike

--- 帖子 #1346 ---
I see.

I thought you update this message from time to time, and regard the EA as the original system. Maybe, you need to explain this somehow, so other members may not misunderstand it as I did.

Here are the on-going totals.

The profitable pairs we've seen over the past few weeks are starting to dim.  I'm not ready to count anything out yet because over time some may brighten back up.

--- 帖子 #1351 ---
I'm considering at this moment to give my computer a break and skip the next couple of weeks of trading.  Trading hours for the holidays are going to make it difficult to get a good test anyways.  I will resume testing on 1/6/2008 unless anyone thinks it's worth running over the holiday season.

--- 帖子 #1352 ---
This is encouraging and the reason why I will continue to forward test the demos.  If we all look back at the history here you will see it's not always pretty but how it looks over the long run is nice.

Happy holidays

Hi bjk2801

I didnt eliminate the eur/usd, I just picked 2 pairs.

eur/jpy - because results were good from Mike's initial testing.

gbp/usd - despite bad results for Mikelath I felt the results for this pair could improve with different parameters. I still believe this system can be fine tuned for different pairs based on timing.

I'm trading manually so 2 pairs is easy to handle. I'm not sure how you would change the ea settings for these parameters.

Happy xmas to all, looking forward to a prosperous new year.

Being so impressed by PipNick's results based on alternate settings (see post#1354), as of next week I will be conducting a comparative study between the two systems I'll be naming D95P and PipNick. Both will run in separate NF demo accounts. Though PipNick trades only EJ and GU, I'll include EU as well. I'm really hoping that the PipNick system outperforms the already profitable D95P in order to prove this venture worthwhile.

I might hold off going live for another 2-3 weeks to first see the results of this comparative.

i dont know how to use it because i dont know its properties or settings

and i bak tested it with meta tester but my results was very bad and it was not just like you that you posted

thank you

--- 帖子 #1370 ---
Hi Mike

I'm flattered you are picking up these settings as well, as you say it will be very interesting to see the comparison. I'm sure my timings will enhance what are already good results. I also believe further fine tuning could be done based on my comments in post 1267, however we should probably concentrate on proving the main system first. One step at a time I think.

I'm not recording any trades over the xmas period I will start again on 2nd Jan. However, I have been keeping a visual on things and 24th would have been profitable with today (27th) yiedling a maximum +190 pips.

I will try and post daily results, when you start your testing with my parameters, so we can ensure things are in sync. Others can do the same if they are testing as well.

I'm very tempted to kick this off live when i return from a weeks holiday on 21st Jan. I'll see how things go between now and then first.

Good luck all

Nick

Mike,

just to refresh all of our memories, could you post the trading rules and pairs you are using them on for both your system and pipnick's system?

At this point, speaking for myself, I am confused as to exactly how you are trading which pair.

thanks.

--- 帖子 #1375 ---
i am agree with big bobcat

and when i back tested EA my rsults was very bad and it was not results whoch you sent in this thread before

please tell me is there any settings or properties for EA that i should mentioned ?

thank you

--- 帖子 #1376 ---
This looks like it may be a good setup and the results have been great.  I just have one question looking at the results... How does a pair end up with -45?  If you are waiting to move the sl to be when the 2nd order hits the tp then wouldn't the results be different?  Are you still using all the original settings (sl 30, and tp at +15, +30, +50) and only changing the start and look back hours and when be is adjusted?

You probably mentioned this but which broker are you using?

My own testing under the 8-17 time frame shows better results for those pairs with NF rather than IBFX although both are positive.  Also the look back hours are 17 rather than 24.  A longer look back time may be a good thing.  Thanks for sharing.

Hi Mike,

I am very impressed with your results and pip nicks results. I have a question though and please forgive me if it has already been asked. I have gone through the previous posts but I do not see an answer to my question. My question have you programmed an EA to what PipNick ideas are? I know you have an EA for your impressive Daily95pips but are you using an EA to trade both your ideas and PipNick's or are you trading PipNicks ideas manually? I am a newbie to EA's but if you are trading PipNicks ideas on your EA what are exact settings that you are using? I would like to know that so I can do the same as you. Again, very impressive results for both of your ideas.

Jeff

--- 帖子 #1381 ---
Hi folks.

For all those confused by the new comparative between the D95P and PipNick settings it's really quite simple.

There is no new EA for PipNick's settings. Simply adjust the settings on your existing EA (depending on the broker) to suit the following:

trade time = 8am gmt

look back = 24hrs

sl = move 3rd order to b/e when tp2 hit

This means that in the Fall Version North Finance EA I've made the DayStartHour:10 , the LookBackHours:24 and the UpdateToBE:30 which should (I think) be the same as the settings used by PickNick.

The DayStartHour will vary slightly according to the MT4 broker you use.

If you need to use a timeconverter then do so: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html

For example, I calculated 8am GMT to equal 6pm Brisbane which is 10hrs difference from when orders are placed by the EA at 8am here in Brisbane. Based on the D95P settings,the DayStartHour on the NF EA is usually set to 0, so I've simply added 10hrs to that to arrive at a setting of 10.

Regarding the upcoming comparative, I'll be using 2 North Finance demo accounts, one with the above PipNick settings and the other with the same D95P settings I've been using practically all along. ie. DayStartHour:0 , LookBackHours: 17 and UpdateToBE: 15

I hope this clarifies things somewhat and I look forward to the comparative.

Hi Mike,

Thank you for clarifying the difference between the two. I have a question about  sl = move 3rd order to b/e when tp2 hit.

Do you mean to put the sl amount to be the same as the figure we have in Take Proftit 2 category? The current amount listed in the EA for take profit 2 is 30. i am using the EA for FXDD. I am new to EA's so I could be completely off base and I apologize for that if I am. If I am incorrect, would you clarify it a little more for me?

Thank You,

Hi mtaboneweb

A pair will end up with -45 if the first order is hit (+15) and the second 2 get stopped (-60). I move the 3rd SL to BE when the second target is hit. Then aside of the start time and look back, everything else is as page 1.

The broker I am using is GFT (www.gftuk.com).

Hi Wallstreet03

I don't have an ea for this, although the ea with the original settings can be altered, see some of Mike's previous posts for instructions.

I am just trading it manually at present.

Cheers

Nick

I'm affraid it is not exeactly as you posted.

Pipnink wrote: "sl = move 3rd order to b/e when tp2 hit".

If you change UpdateToBE setting on the EA to 30, it means that the 2nd order's SL will not be changed to BE when first TP hit (15). And this is not what Pipnick wrote. He wrote that we need to change ONLY the third order's SL.

--- 帖子 #1390 ---
I am sure you are correct, smilee89. Pipninck trades manually and so can alter the sl in this way. I am fairly sure the ea cannot do this.

Ask PipNick.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your forward test.

I have a question.

Does the result from the first weeks include other pairs that has been deleted before or it contains only the 3 remaining pairs?

And if the answer is positive (Includes) do you have the WEEKLY results for only the 3 remaining pairs from the beginning?

Before I start to calculate, I preferred to ask you.

Thanks

Keivan

Hi Keivan.

Yes, the first weeks results include all 6 pairs. In other words, whatever results are posted are for the pairs mentioned in those posts.

To break it down you would need to refer to those previous posts, including the weekly results for the 3 remaining pairs while the weekly results included other pairs as well. See post#92 to get you started.

Hello all,

Mikelath, pipnick, et al, thank you for your continued work on this thread.  I am new to this am trying to follow along with a demo account.  I set one up at NF, loaded the EA, but I am not getting nearly the same numbers as posted.  I ran the EA titled "daily 95 pips NF fall version"  I ran this against usd/jpy from 12/24.  I received the following:

This is only for the 24th but it seems to be wrong.  I read through most of the thread and it looks like the time may be an issue in my EA setting?  I ran this for longer durations and see a substantial loss as opposed to what is being reported in this thread.  I'm not sure if I am doing something else wrong.

As I stated I am new to this and would appreciate anyones help.

Thank you in advance

Is anyone trading this system with real money???

--- 帖子 #1399 ---
Are you results based on the original Fall EA settings on these 3 pairs?  or did you make adjustments?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1400 ---
Yes - I am.  Been kind of rough lately.  Will start live again on Jan. 6th.

--- 帖子 #1401 ---
I was - that coincided with the start of two weeks of losses. Just bad luck I suppose, but enough to make me watch for a little while longer before going live again.

Here is the reservation I have about the system. A +95 is difficult to achieve, whilst a -90 happens the moment a market moves decisively against the trade and triggers the sl of all three orders.

Intellectually, it is difficult to argue against the profits consistently shown by the system. The fact is, all I did was lose money.

None of this is intended as a criticism of MikeLath or anyone else  here. They control the markets no more effectively than I do.

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
Great question!

I've made lots in Demo accounts and lost in Real Money accounts. Seems to make a big difference and I believe someone or some software takes our SL for profits. It would be great  to hear from others.

Romeo

--- 帖子 #1403 ---
I traded with real money; didn't lose too much, but I had losses nonetheless. I like the concept of the system and will continue to trade in demos. Truth be told, I did not have much practice with it in a demo to begin with. The losses were probably due to operator error and no so much the system itself, but using an EA is pretty much straight forward.

Still think you rock mikelath!

Hi all. Those who have been following this thread closely will know that I'm yet to commit any live funds to this strategy and as mentioned in post#1 I do not encourage anyone to do so until thorough testing of this system has been done.

I understand that it's sometimes hard to resist the temptation of 'jumping in' and there have been numerous occasions when I've been on the verge of going live myself.

In a recent post I mentioned that I was almost ready to go live, however I've chosen to hold off for another 2-3 weeks until the comparative between the D95P and PipNick settings shows some conclusive results.

One lesson I've learnt from forex trading is that a surefire recipe for failure is to dabble for a short period in any given system, pull out when experiencing some drawdown thus concluding that it's an unprofitable system, and then move onto another system to repeat the same process again. People, you will undoubtedly lose money following this approach.

I consider it a better option to be a little more patient and test a system as thoroughly as possible before being convinced of taking the next step of going live. Even if the live experience is different to the demo trading I'll be rest assured that I allowed sufficient time for testing first.

Hello all, can anyone please help me understand why my backtest is not matching anything here?  I posted some sample information in post 1396.  I dont think its a daystarttime issue anymore since it is set to 0, which should be correct for NF.  I would really appreciate anyones help in this.

Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #1409 ---
Time to throw in my two cents worth...

You can back test and forward test in a demo accounts all you want - everything ALWAYS varies when you start putting real money on the line.

Why - because there are just too many variables - the market is ALWAYS changing.  We try to identify and exploit common patterns and characteristics, but nothing is a for sure thing.  It could all change tomorrow.  If you do not understand or are not comfortable with this simple fact, then you are investing in the wrong place.

The broker I use will allows me to enter orders as small as .01 lots.  That is 10 cents per pip on the line or risking 9.00 per day to trade the 3 pairs with the EA live as Mike has laid it out.  Now I realize that every broker will not allow you to enter such small live orders...

- BUT IF THEY DO AND IF YOU ARE NOT TRADING THIS SYSTEM LIVE -

then take my advice and find some system you are willing to risk 9.00 per day on and quit wasting your time on this thread.  There are other systems out there that might better fit your trading style in this forum alone.

Happy New Year - 2008 promises to be a year filled with opportunities to capture as many pips as you can handle.  You just have to find or develop a system that fits your trading style and run with it...

--- 帖子 #1410 ---
Thank you tsquad.  even with the broker variables would it be so extreme that this EA would show substantial losses in sample backtest?

I have a feeling I may just not be doing something incorrectly.  Any help would be fantastic

happy new year everyone!!!

Hello mike how are you? i have one question

Did you already include your spread in this results on each pair or no??

If you consider that all postions could be opened in one way every day, that means 3 positions/day, 15 positions/week and 120 positions/18 weeks.

But we must also consider that sometimes positions will not be open, because of flat!! On the other side positions could be open on both sides, That means 6 positions.

Spread at my broker cms:

EUR/JPY  4 pips

USD/JPY  3 pips

EUR/USD  3 pips

example EUR/JPY ( i will take 120 positions)

EURJPY +1893     120 posit. x 4 pip spread=480

REAL RESSULTS:1893-480= 1413pips

example USD/JPY ( i will take 120 positions)

USDJPY +201     120 posit. x 3 pip spread=360

REAL RESSULTS:201-360= -159pips

example EUR/USD ( i will take 120 positions)

EURUSD +829    120 posit. x 3 pip spread=360

REAL RESSULTS:829-360= 469pips

with spread
EURJPY +1893  -------> 1413  pips

USDJPY +201    -------> -159  pips

EURUSD +829   -------> 496   pips

Total: +2923pips  ------>       1750 pips

thank you in advance,

good luck,

Mine is grey as well - that is normal. Just make sure he is smiling.

Also, on your MT4 platform, go through Tools\Options\Expert Advisors and make sure 'Allow live trading; is selected there as well. If this is not selected, the little guy can grin to international standards, but he still won't actually do anything,

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
GBP/USD = +95

EUR/JPY = +95

I didn't place trades yesterday, I'm not sure how we should treat bank hol closures with a 24hr look back. I see it was a loser from Mike's results and it may be best to ignore - something to keep an eye on I think?

Lets hope Mikes results line up with mine today.

I will try and add the EUR/USD in future if I get time.

Hey guys,

must say that i am fond of the "daily95pis" strategy as it suits my trading style, so many thanks to Mike for posting it!

As I read before Mike, you are currently using North Finance for EA. How come that you switched from Oanda, where is the reason (easier, better performance,..)?

thanks in advance

T

--- 帖子 #1428 ---
Hi forexplorer.

Oanda does not support the use of Expert Advisors, so I switched to North Finance which is an MT4 broker in order to automate the trading of this system.

--- 帖子 #1429 ---
PipNick,

I'm wondering if adding EURUSD was a good idea. I'm tempted to axe both EU from the PipNick list and UJ from the D95P list to be left with 2 pairs each. Will decide within the coming weeks.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1430 ---
Thanks for prompt answer!

I know all this. Is your performance also better/different if you follow an EA, or with N.F. platform? I mean "daily95pips" takes only aprox. 10 minutes to put all trades in and thats it (fast enough for me, as i than need to do my other 9-5 job that i like)

--- 帖子 #1431 ---
Hi Mike

I'm not really sure, I am just sticking to the 2 because of time constraints. I have a day job so I don't have the time to place orders for, or monitor too many pairs. This is the reason your system is so great for me.

If you have them set up on an EA and its not much effort, may as well leave them be. As long as the data is recorded you can assess the profitability in the future, as you have done in the past e.g. you eliminated GBP/USD previously.

It would be nice to get in to a position where all pairs have been tested over a period for profitablity. Possibly with different params to find the optimum. This is nirvana though. As I am only aiming for an average 15 pips a day, 2 pairs is also good enough for the time being.

Cheers

Nick

--- 帖子 #1432 ---
I haven't continued manually trading this system to compare results with those of the EA.

It's your call which approach you'd like to take. If your preference is to trade manually you can consider that PipNick for example is successfully trading 2 pairs manually.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1433 ---
Hi warrior.

18 is fine. The original setting was 17, however the main purpose is to simply prevent orders being triggered soon before the new orders are due to be placed for the new session..that's all.

rgs

mike

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
Thanks, Mikelath.

--- 帖子 #1435 ---
With an EA it will automatically adjust the SL for you.  Do you make this adjustment manually since you are trading manually?  If so, then you are tied to the charts waiting for it to happen when an EA does it for you.

--- 帖子 #1436 ---
can someone show me the post  where the EA is listed?

or send it to me

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
A question for the more experienced traders here.

Trading live, I would have deleted all the pending orders at least 3 hours before today's NFP release.

Being on demo, I left them all open to see what happened. This resulted in a 70 eu pips (I closed the  third order when the spike looked like reversing).

So my question; was leaving the pendings in place a sensible idea, or did benefit purely from dumb luck?

Cheers

Hi,

Thanks Mike! great system!

One question: do you open trades today? (friday)

--- 帖子 #1439 ---
Thanks for this strategy.

I made +95 pips on GBP/USD

This is a great strategy.

NB.

Do you open trades on Friday, using this strategy?

I am using the EA for this strategy on Alpari UK. Do I need to leave my internat connection on for 24 hours?

Hope to get reply from any one.

--- 帖子 #1440 ---
Steve and all - for whatever its worth here are my thoughts...

NFP of course means volitility.  From my observations, this often involves a strong move in one direction, followed by retracing back.  Look at EU today - it jumped 100 pips one way and retraced back 40+.  Using this observation, I am trading NFP in this fashion.

1.  If I cannot be at the computer during the announcement, I will just skip this day or close everything before the announcements.

2.  Unless I have a strong feeling on what the initial move is going to be, I close any orders that are open.  If I do have that feeling, then I will close any open orders that contradict that feeling.

3.  For unopened orders, I will monitor those closely and watch for the orders being opened.  When a set of trades are opened, I watch for that intial move to 'stall out' and then I close everything that did not hit the TP as quick as I can.

To answer your question - did you feel the market was going to move in your favor?  If so - then you were prudent - if not - luck.

Me - I was on the sidelines this morning...

Tim

One nasty thing I did forget to add - gaps.  Although it is not too common, with very volitle news event there can be a gap in price.  The market instantly jumps say 100 pips or more.  Since the market never hit your price point, your sl, tp, entry price you entered into the computer cannot be honored.  Instead, you will get the price AFTER the gap.  For example, if you had an open order that was at break even with a 30 pip stop loss and the market jumped 100 pips against you, you would get stopped out at a 100 pip loss, not the 30 pip you anticipated.  Just something to be aware of...

Hehe. Turns out it was dumb luck. Thanks for your reply, Tim. Most helpful; your way of dealing with this make sense to me.

I don't know how you are trading, cuase I have had Daily 95 pips on 3 brokers and no trades yet

I'll give it another week and then to forget the whole thing.

Hi Christancho.

Very interesting results from the Reverse EA. It appears that you may have manually closed out some of these trades or used the trailing stop ?

To date I haven't had my own demo dedicated to the reverse EA. Rather, I've been waiting to see posts like yours before making a decision.

Now I'm inspired.

To answer your question; yes, I run the EA's on Friday....basically from Mon-Fri and close them over the weekend.

Okay, may I know what u guys r up to?

GBP/USD = -45

EUR/JPY = n/t

I don't think i have mentioned this before, I don't leave trades open over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
Hi Steve - Personally I would like to let things ride over news events. Mike's objective is to develop a set and forget system and considering various news events detracts from this somewhat in my opinion.

However I do agree that there appears to be an initial move and retrace for these events and this could be damaging. On the other hand, depending on the proximity of price to the daily high or low, a sudden spike may also reap profit.

Cheers

What did you change UpdateToBE = for pipnicks version to be?

Mikes is 15, did you change it to 30?  I saw some discrepancies in the past few pages.

Thanks all

Yes, because some pairs have about 10pips spread. I am forward testing all the pair, but I am really interested in EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF, USDJPY and EURJPY.

Hi Mikelath

I would like to thank you very much for starting this thread.  I'm reading it all the way to the end(up to page 40).

I'm a newbie to Forex.  I have been playing with a demo for 6 months, losing more than winning.  But when I came across your system I think I might be able to learn something that might give me enough courage to go to LIVE trading.

I have looked at other systems on the FF forum, but as I'm a dummy I don't understand what they are trying to teach.  Your's seems so much easier, that even I can understand what you are getting at.

THANK YOU so much.

Hi ozzibob.

I'm glad to hear that you've taken the time to read the entire thread...certainly a good example for others who do not.

I find it fulfilling to assist you in the early stages of forex trading, especially if I can help you to NOT lose money.

Yes, you will find this system extremely simple if you are using the Expert Advisor with an MT4 broker. You will therefore not be required to look for trade setups based on a combination of indicators as many systems do. That being said however, there are numerous such systems on forexfactory with EA's already programmed as well.

Provided this system continues to be profitable in a live scenario it will then free you up to do other things with your time.

Bear in mind that it's still a work in progress, however the day for my taking it live is drawing very near.

Oh, so you reside in the Great South-East....keep in touch.

Hello at all, specifically at mikelath.

I am a great fan of Daily95pips.

I trade it manually without an ea since november 2007.

Many ideas come around here to optimise the system with different currencys.

I propose the following idea:

Well, we all want trade gbp/jpy currency because there was alot of money to make with

but the volatility was to big so it fails often with d95p parameters.

(Sorry for my english because its not my native language.)

My idea is to trade gbp/jpy with the d95p system and another set of parameters.

I try a lot of parameters in backtesting and i have found

a setting that are best for gbp/jpy but it cannot named daily95pips.

Here are my results of backtesting for the last weeks:

Total for week ending Friday 4 Jan 2008: +510pips

Total for week ending Friday 28 Dec 2007: +280pips

Total for week ending Friday 21 Dec 2007: +520pips

Total for week ending Friday 7 Sept 2007: -310pips

Total for week ending Friday 31 Aug 2007: +580pips

Total +4640pips

Weekly average = +244pips

Monthly average = +976pips

I backtesting manually 'set and forget' that mean i do not move any SL to BE or so

will mean its free to optimse for smaller losses.

Since 19 Nov 2007 i do forwardtesting it as always with good performance.

Here are the settings for gbp/jpy:

Buy/Long Orders:

1 - Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=40pips, S/L=60pips

2 - Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=80pips, S/L=60pips

3 - Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=110pips, S/L=60pips

Vice versa for Short

Time to set Orders is 5pm EST.

High and low of the previous 17hrs.

Need good moneymanagement and something to reserve to overcome negative weeks.

Happy trading and greetigs

Very good NaranJoe.

I must admit that I'm becoming overwhelmed with all the different setting possibilities.

I only hope that Vensik and mtaboneweb who are conducting a thorough analysis will very soon share with us all the optimal settings for numerous pairs.

Here are the new Experts that I have been working on for the past month for D95P. I have been monitoring the thread and I have taken care of all the problems with the previous EA versions that have been discussed.

These EAs are set up to trade the rules that have been discussed and that are in place currently for D95P. You cannot change any of the inputs at the present time with the exception of the risk % and fixed lots. I have set them for you so that there is no confusion among everyone as to what the settings should be. Just attach them to your charts for the brokers indicated and let them do the work.

If you wish to continue testing with different settings you will need to use one of the older versions at the present time. I currently do not have the time to write a new instruction manual on the settings of the new EAs.

I have rewritten all the code from the previous versions, so these EA versions are a lot more complicated. Take a look in the experts tab in the terminal window and the EAs give you a lot of information as to what is going on.

Look at my following post to find the versions for PipNick.

Have a PipFull Day

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
Good stuff NaranJoe - the results are impressive. I have been meaning to explore settings on GBP/JPY but have been spending my time on other pairs for now, before moving on.

Please can you confirm you are canceling the high order if the low is executed and vice versa?

Thanks

Hi Piphunter196

I am using GFT as my broker and it is possible to code strategies (EA's) using 'Common Technical Analysis Language'. Is this the same langauage as the EA's you have attahced. If not do you know if they could easily be converted?

If not, I think may well have to open an additional account so I can use the EA.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1463 ---
Hi tdion,

i have not removed the spread.

I know the spread of gbp/jpy is large but with this performance it is not so bad.

Hi PipNick,

yes, the short order is canceled when long is executed and vice versa.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1464 ---
PipNick,

1st of all let me say thanks for all the hard work. I find the settings that you have come up with to be very interesting.

I have been in contact with GFT about this very subject. They say that the logic of this EA can be programmed in their terminal language, but I have not had the time to follow up with them on it.

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #1465 ---
Thanks PipHunter196!!!

--- 帖子 #1466 ---
Hi PipHunter,

Thank You for all of your work. I have one question for you. I use IkonToyal. It has the same server time as FXDD (GMT +2 ) would it be ok to use the fxdd ea version on ikon royal? Just a note to everyone. I have tested EA's on both demo accounts and live accounts with the following brokers. Ikon Royal, Alpari, ODL, FXDD, and Interbank. The only one of those where the demo account matched the live account is on Ikon Royal. It matched it perfectly. As well as Ikon Royal has the best performace of any of the brokers. FXDD was very close. Just a little off. I do not know why there is such a big difference between the brokers but there are.

--- 帖子 #1467 ---
Hi Guys and Girls

I am also with GFT and would really love it if a EA could be worked out for dealbook, I really know nothing about how to code so im not much help in that way but if someone could help out I would be very gratefull. Thank to all who keep on doing wonderful work in this thread.

I back tested the strategy with the original settings of the latest EAs and I get bad results for the two currency pairs I tested (USDJPY and EURUSD).  Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #1471 ---
I wonder if anyone back tested this system for the time before July 2007?

As my test result, it works good only for recent several months.

Did something change the market at that time?

--- 帖子 #1472 ---
One can get a pretty good idea of how the system does if one runs the MT4 back tester...  You can back test the system from before 2000 till now on any pair and get quite accurate results...

Results are not good at all.  Equity goes to zero.

--- 帖子 #1473 ---
Today (Tuesday), Pipnick Ea opened a future buy stop position for the GBP-JPY at 216.99.

I dont see any reason for this price.

The highest price for this pair for the last 24 hours was 216.45. If I add the spread, it should not be higher than 216.5.

Any comment?

--- 帖子 #1474 ---
PipHunter196,

Thanks for all the hard work on the EA. I currently am testing the system using a $50,000 demo account. I have not changed any of your pre-set settings. On the first EJ trade entered via the EA, it showed I was trading 1.8 standard lots. Is that correct for a 50K demo? If I want to trade more conservatively, do I just adjust the risk factor?

Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #1475 ---
azjeff,

You can use the EA for Ikon Royal if it is on the same time as FXDD. The only problem may be the trades that are initiated on Sunday/Monday. This depends on when the first bar is formed for the trading day. If they open for trading at the same time FXDD does there will be no problem.

jeta & lukegan,

You can back test strategies all day long, but you will not get accurate stats from the MT4 back-tester. It does not back-test from tick data and that is the only way to get accurate results.

smilee89,

I do not follow the GBP-JPY pair so I am not sure what the High for the 24 hour period was. I can take a look into it if you let me know what broker you are using. The most the EA should move the price from the high or low is 5 pips and that is only if the current price at the time the orders are placed is the same or greater than the high or low for the period.

yen44x,

This would be the correct lot amount for risking 2%, which is the default setting on the EA. If you want to change it you can in the inputs section. You can either change the risk percent or set it to a fixed lot size.

Amen

Backtesting in an MT4 environment is the forex equivalent of fool's gold - it looks pretty but has no real value.  If you do not have tick for tick data, it will NEVER be accurate.

Even demo accounts can give you varying results.  Unless someone has a better idea, the only real way I know to test is to set up LIVE accounts, using the smallest lots possible, and monitor the results that way...

--- 帖子 #1477 ---
PipHunter196,

Thanks so much for your help. I apologize for my ignorance about EA's. This is the first one I have worked with. One follow-up question and I should be off and running: If I set a fixed lot size, does that override the risk percent or do I need to change the risk percent setting to 0?

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #1478 ---
yen44x,

Yes it will overide the risk % if you use a fixed lot amount greater than 0.

Hi PipHunter196,

Your ea expired.

cashfinder,

I do not know why the alert went off for you. It is not set to do that until the end of January. I put this function in to keep old versions of the EA from being used. Try reloading it and let me know what happens. As I stated before, this should not happen until after 2/2/08.  This is when I plan to come out with the next version update!

Sorry for the trouble.

Hi,

More results: Date 07-Jan-2008

AUDUSD  -75

EURCHF  +15

EURJPY  +15

GBPJPY  +45

GBPUSD -35 (UpdateToBE was at 30 not 15 pips ouch!)

USDJPY +96

EURGBP +63 (manually closed)

Total: +124 pips

Not bad...

I guess that the combinations with EUR and JPY are working just fine with this method.

Thanks Mike!!

--- 帖子 #1482 ---
For scalping EAs, I quite agree.  For EAs that have a TP>30 and a SL>30, M1 data is pretty accurate (for EURUSD)

Then again, a 30 pip SL and 30 pip TP is a scalp for GBPJPY, so adjust accordingly.

--- 帖子 #1483 ---
I wonder.... if I missed in previous recent posts, please accept appologies.

Some of us, namely myself, don't use the EA, we trade this manually.

Is it possible, to list both the current parameters as well as the pairs still under consideration. , I for one, am totally confused at this point. I'm certain that I could gather the information by reading the thread. But it's easier this way, just to list the information. It's a good way to take a moment & get everyone thinking in the same direction, too. The thread is getting really large(this is good!), and a good portion devoted to developing & refining the EA. And several adjustments in parameters as well as pairs especially of late.

And the method's parameters aren't that complicated.

Thanks in advance for this. I know that I ask on behalf of others. besides myself.

--- 帖子 #1484 ---
Downloaded EA today so this was my first experience with it.  It opened only buy stops taht were no where near where they should have been.

Example

EURUSD      Buy  @  1.4719

USDJPY      Buy  @  109.01

GBPJPY       Buy  @  214.96

EURJPY      Buy  @  160.27

Did I miss something???

PipHunter196,

Thank you for your continued patience. I tried changing the settings under Inputs, but when I check it later, the settings have defaulted back to the original.

Since I don't know much about EA's, let me make sure I am doing it right. I went into Inputs, revised the settings, hit "OK", and then shut down MetaTrader and restarted it. When that didn't work I next revised the setting, hit "Load" just in case that made a difference, then "OK", etc. That didn't work either.

Am I missing a step in the process?

--- 帖子 #1486 ---
I am still here.  I took off for the holidays but have started up my testing again at the start of this week.  I have been looking at all the interesting posts and my head is spinning.  I think it's great that so many people are involved and trying new settings and it has started me thinking in some other directions as well.  Up until the holidays my testings has been the following to recap:

3 IBFX and 3 NF demo accounts each running 18 pairs.

Demo set 1: start time of 08 GMT / look back hours of 17 (London open)

Demo set 2: start time of 13 GMT / look back hours of 17 (New York open)

Demo set 3: start time of 22 GMT / look back hours of 17 (5pm eastern, original strategy)

Testing on these 6 demos began on the week ending 11/25/2007 and have continued each week (forward testing) minus the past 2 weeks because of the holidays.  The purpose is to see which time frame performs the best and for which pairs in those time frames.  In addition, it was also to see the difference between IBFX and NF to determine which broker performed better.  At this point I'm not really sure I've fully answered that question as some pairs do better on one broker and others do better on the other.  I was really expecting to see a smaller difference between the two and be able to say the following:

1. X broker is better than Y.

2. These pairs should be run in the 08 GMT time frame.

3. These pairs should be run in the 13 GMT time frame.

4. These pairs should be run in the 22 GMT time frame.

There have been some rough weeks that have passed and none seem to be doing very well at this point although I feel with more time things will become clearer and certain pairs in certain time frames will rise above the others as overall winners.

Also I had made the original modifications to the EA to enable reverse trading.  I have had some assistance with testing but none to the extent that I would have taken it so I'm feeling a little neglecting on my duties in that area.  I wish I could test all the scenarios that are rolling around in my brain but my computer wont handle it all.  I have to assume that if one direction is doing poorly consistently then there is a good chance that reversing the direction could be profitable.  There are some pairs that have just done terrible since I started and these may be big winners in a reverse scenario although I have no concrete evidence to prove that.  It seems that Christancho is testing some pairs with the reverse EA with fair results.

I think what I would like to do is drop the NF demos for a couple of reasons.  I can't see myself at this point dropping my live IBFX account to go with NF.  I'm not sure I trust going with a broker outside of my own country.  I realize they may all be crooked to some extent.  I did see a post recently on this thread about Ikon Royal?  They seem like a possible option since the live and demo accounts were so close and I think they're located in New York?  This is always another layer of complexity when testing anything.  Once you finally go live you don't get the same performance.

I did start my original testing again this week and have added a 7th demo.  This is an IBFX demo account running on 18 pairs with PipNick's settings.

08 start time

24 hour look back

update to be at 30

If I drop the NF demos I will be adding 3 IBFX demos to test the same time frames but with the reverse EA.  It may also be wise to add the other 2 time frames with PipNick's settings.  I'm not sure I could or would want to run 9 demo accounts on my computer at once.

I feel I've rambled enough...

Any thoughts?

Thx Piphunter

I have reinstalled the ea and it works. (pipnick ibfx version)

By the way, what timeframe should I use in the chart?

Carlton

--- 帖子 #1488 ---
Hi Mombone,

Some suggestions:

1. Attach the EA to 1hr chart.

2. Check the start hour, for Interbank it is 22 (22h00 GMT = 17h00 GMT-5).

3. Check the EA's properties, allow Long&Short positions.

Regards.

--- 帖子 #1490 ---
Thanks for picking up my settings, I would certainly like to see them run, it will be interesting to see how these compare.

I would agree that the broker comparison is not so important for now. Others people can cross check these with their own demos for validation?

I would also like to see one additional demo for GBY/JPY using naranjoe's settings. I think these are only relevant to G/J. So no other pairs would be required.

Keep up the good work.

This is turning into a fantastic thread, thanks again to Mike for strating it.

Has the standard Mike's daily 95 ea been back tested for several years on the EUR/JPY to see if it's profitable in the long run? How much drawdown and has it been profitable every month? Thanks, Paris

I downloaded the D95P Standard (FXDD Fall Version 5.2) and will be testing it on EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF, & EUR/USD. The trade settings for EUR/JPY & EUR/CHF came up with no problem today, but nothing happened with EUR/USD. Do you have any idea what might cause that?

Thanks!

I have modified the testing I'm doing.  The attached graphic explains the settings that are being used so I don't have to repeat them in my posts.  I already have data from 11/25/2007 through current so I will keep it in the sheet although the reverse test data will start accumulating this week.  I started running reverse EAs yesterday and will continue to post full and weekly results.

In addition to this testing I am also running one demo account using the same 18 currency pairs with PipNick's rules.  I will post full and weekly results on this demo separately.

All testing is now being done using Interbank FX demo accounts.  In the future I may switch to Ikon Royal if I find more positive feedback about them.

Any thoughts?

Here are the detailed results of gbp/jpy with my settings described in post #1456

for the week ending Friday 11 January 2008.

From this week i trade with the ea "ibfx fall" and "Update to Break Even: 80 Pips"

Monday 7 January        0 nt

Tuesday 8 January       120 pips

Wednesday 9 January -180 pips

Thursday 10 January    0 nt

Friday 11 January         230 pips

Total 170pips

Intermediate result.

No good week for the "big mover".

I hope next week there will be more rather than less.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1504 ---
170 pips in a week is very respectable.  Thanks for sharing your settings.  I've added a chart to cover this starting next week as well.

--- 帖子 #1505 ---
Entry Long  = HIGH+5 pips  ?????

Entry Short = LOW-5pips    ?????

stop loss 30 pips ??

thank's

--- 帖子 #1506 ---
Yes.  As I understand it, PipNick is using the fall version which sets +/- pips above and below with stop loss of 30.

--- 帖子 #1507 ---
Hi Wallstreet

my settings for stop loss and tp are as mikes. However I move the 3rd stop loss to b/e when the second target is hit.

--- 帖子 #1508 ---
Thanks mta.

I am fully expecting some pairs not to be profitable with these settings. specifically I am not expecting good results for pairs that do not contain GBP, EUR or CHF, becasue of the 8m start time.

Nor would I expect G/J to be profitable as it is too volatile.

It will be interesting to see how things turn out.

This week has not been great.

--- 帖子 #1509 ---
Not bad at all naranjoe. Please keep posting your results.

--- 帖子 #1517 ---
you have 5 straight profitable months, well done! - no need for despondency that I can see. a losing month or even two consequetive losing months with substantial drawdown is inevitable oneday with a purely numerically based system. You need to be prepared to trade through when things get  really tough so you can still be participating when those consequetive 1000+ pip months come back.

--- 帖子 #1518 ---
hi  shisuyu

Your settings are almost right,

TakeProfit levels are 40, 80, 110 and StopLoss are 60 pips (GBP/JPY only).

Because these settings you must UpdateToBE setting 40 or 80 pips!

The time, 5pm EST is 10pm GMT !

For your broker FXDD the time for Daystarthour is 0 not 24!!!.

Note, there are different results from different broker!

My broker was IBFX.

I think backtesting with strategytester in MT4 does not work properly because there is

a problem with timehandling.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1519 ---
Hey  Naranjoe,

thanks for posting your strategy, looks impressive.

I have few question, I hope you might answer.

1) Are you still testing this strategy or actually trading with it?

2) On  Tuesday 8 January      , you got 120 pips, what represents 2 trades. What happened with the third one, since you don't count it?

thaaaaankx

--- 帖子 #1520 ---
Naranjoe

The problem with backtesting is that it is not tick for tick - meaning it does not look at what happened during a period of time - only what the opening and close price for that period was.

ie.  For a given period, if the open price was 1.4750  - the high 1.4850, the low 1.4650 and close 1.4750 - a backtest would view that period as if the market did not move.  In real time, using Mike's system, you could have a 90 pip loss <OR> a 95 pip gain and in either case would been closed out for the day.  If backtesting - nothing would have happened or changed.

Now I too am using IBFX, central time zone.  If I understand correctly, to match your settings on the EA, I should be using 22 as the start time with 17 as the number of look back hours.

Thanks

Tim

Hi Ykb

it is not my strategy, developer is mikelath.

I just try to adapt the strategy to gbp/jpy.

Answer of your questions:

1) i do actually forward testing with IBFX demo.

2) We always have 3 orders.

On tuesday 8 January only the first and second order was reached.

On TP2 the EA move SL of third order to BE, then the price come down and close the order at BE.

I have 40 pips on 1., 80 pips on 2. and 0 on 3. = 120 pips

hope this helps to understand.

Hi tsquad

you are correct

Happy trading

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1522 ---
thanks for your replay,

since I trade manually, I am not familiar with "BE", I have no idea, what it means.

Correct me if I am wrong, but when TP2 is reached, the S/L of third order is moved to the position where the order was initiated? (not counting the spread).

Does anything happen with the S/L setting when the TP1 is reached?

Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #1523 ---
BE means Break Even.

Hi,

Here are my results for: 10-Jan-08

GBPUSD -75

GBPJPY -75

USDJPY -75

UERCHF -75

EURGBP +49

Total: -251 pips ouch!

and for: 11-Jan-08

EURCHF -75

EURGBP +33

GBPJPY -75

GBPUSD -75

USDJPY -52

Total: -244 double ouch!

Check the attached image... I think that I have to change the strategy on  GBPUSD and other red ones to the original D95P and I stay with EURJPY USDJPY with the reverse D95P.

By the way... on friday the EA didn't open any trades... any suggestions?.

I believe on the system!... just have to tune it up!

Together, we can improve the system for each pair.

Regards.

Christancho

--- 帖子 #1525 ---
It is dependent on what risks you want to enter.

You can move SL on TP1 - thats the save way but in some situations you only made 40 pips (GBP/JPY with my settings) when price moves strong.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1526 ---
First of all, and since this is my first post here (just discovered this thread a week ago) thank you all for this system and the variations/adjustments proposed by all the contributors.

Just have one question to Naranjoe:

In your GBP/JPY variation of the system, why did you choose the 40, 80 and 110 TP exits? Any particular reason?

I am today starting my own forward testing of your variation, with the addition of a fourth lot without any TP and a trailing stop of 70 (something Bullrock proposed somewhere else in the thread).

I will post my results on a weekly basis, for anyone interested.

Thanks,

Middleastern

--- 帖子 #1527 ---
My settigns are only for the GBP/JPY pair because of the volatility.

Day range of GBP/JPY is often 300-500 PIPS.

Day range of other pairs (for example EUR/USD) is only 100-200 PIPS.

GBP/JPY can make more pips as the other and for that we need another setting in D95P.

But caution, the losses are even greater!

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1528 ---
Sure, I understand the higher settings for this pair, but the question is if you chose the 40-80-110 targets arbitrarily or if there is a reason why they are not 30-70-120 for example, or any other close to those TP targets, for that matter.

By the way, today was a good day for your settings with the G/J. It has already hit the 40-80-110 targets, and the fourth free-run lot I am testing is still alive and kicking.

Thanks, and good trading...

--- 帖子 #1531 ---
Hi all, Do you guys trade on LIVE account or demo? I've been reading this forum but I couldn't follow it. What do you mean by placing 6 orders in one pair? if USD/JPY SHORT 109.30 you place STOP L on 109.00, and then place another order? Do you guys have a screenshots for this? This strategy looks very promising and I would like to stick with one strategy since I've followed alot of strategy with unlucky results.

--- 帖子 #1532 ---
Hi Middleastern

Please read post #1456.

I test GBP/JPY with many settings and found best one for this pair.

You can also take other parameter and see what happens but I think I fit very well.

Hi shisuyu

Trade all other with original settings, see post #1, results are different.

This is a good system, Thanks for sharing it

I have been reading about it here in the many pages of this forum, I have a comment,

It would be good if the EA also take into account the daily support and resistance levels for any particular currency pair,

I am not a programmer but would have tested this:

1- adding a finction to calculate the daily resistance and support levels.

2- allowing the EA to adjust entry and exit based on the support/resistance levels, (this could be an optional function - for testing only) -

For example: I wouldn't place my buy order 5 pips before my daily resistance level, instead I would adjust it to 7-8 pips after the resistance level.

I don't want to confuse this system with other systems but I think maybe there is a room for testing and improvement,

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1535 ---
I noticed IBFX is being used alot in demos, but their spreads are higher than other brokers offering MetaTrader, such as FXDD or MIG. Is there another advantage to using IBFX that I am missing?

--BTW I have been live trading the EU & GU on the Daily95 for the past 2+ months using FXCM, and their slippage is terrible. The spread on the GU jumped to 11 pips this morning, open my 3 long positions and stopped me out.  I'll be switching brokers.

On a second note, I had problems with the EA on an FXDD demo account last night, all orders entered but one pair. I moved the setup to the next hour, and the entry orders setup OK. Any idea why this happens?

Great thread everyone, keep it up!

--- 帖子 #1536 ---
IMHO IBFX offers stable service in Live account too.

Don't stick to 1pip spread too much.

--- 帖子 #1537 ---
I've been using quite the same system to trade but this one is even better than the system that I used before. Something like trapping system but better. Keep it up and happy trading.

So I firstly attatched it Live account TODAY

but it doesn't works!

Is it restricted only for Demo account??

I use for demo accounts both Pipnick and Daily95pips EA's.

I use ODL's Fall versions, and both opened trades which I don't understand how.

For example of today 17-Jan-2008: The Price for the sell stop was different between these two EA's. Not only this issue but the price of the 'BOX' that I have for the sell signal is different, it was much lower than what these 2 EA's showed.

How do you explain that?

--- 帖子 #1549 ---
If you like to use EA, you must make sure that you have selected "Allow Live Trading" when installing your EA in your chart. If not, it won't work. Also, you need to activate EA on your account. Make sure you have contacted your broker if you want to trade live using EA. Using demo account, you can use EA to trade but in live account you can't. It must be enabled on broker side.

--- 帖子 #1550 ---
You can use on standard account but in live account, make sure you use no more than 10% of your account balance.

I have three copies of MT4 loaded.  I use different ones for different accounts and a demo account.  During installation just specify a different directory name for the install.  Add a "1" to the end of the directory name, for example.

You can also run multiple instances of the same MT4 program, if you want to.  If the second instance is connected to a different account, you will not see the other account's trades.

I am running on WinXP with no problems.  Had the same arrangement with MT3, too.

Why you have very bad profit factors? Other people are having not bad results. Or you using something different?

--- 帖子 #1562 ---
Hi all. This is my first post in forex factory. D95P looks terrific especially for those with a day job. I would like to thank Mike for sharing this method.

Does anyone know which online forex broker does Mike use?

JPHOLE,

Did you ever get your EA working on your live account with IBFX? I can't seem to get mine working with IBFX (using PipNick IBFX Fall Version 5.2) Today would've been great for the EUR/JPY.http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif

iwm.pips

--- 帖子 #1565 ---
I ever used another EA in my IBFX live account.

I think PipNick IBFX Fall Version 5.2 is restricted to only for demo account

PipHunter, can you fix it ? plz~

--- 帖子 #1566 ---
IBFX allows EA trading, I know because I used an EA in the past on my live account and didn't have any problems,

I don't think there is any restriction from the EA to trade only on Demo accounts,

Try this,

1-open your trading platform IBFX

2-go to the "Tools" menu

3-select "options"

4- Tap to "Expert Advisors"

5- Check all the boxes

You can also check with IBFX online support that your account can trade with EAs

I hope this helps

--- 帖子 #1567 ---
Thanks, but I have other EA's that work on my IBFX account, but the PipNick EA doesn't. I've spoken with IBFX and they don't restrict any EA's. Hopefully it is a coding error that can be fixed. Maybe PipNick can fix it.

--- 帖子 #1568 ---
Only PipNick EA doesn't works.

I'm Waiting for somebody fixing it~D:

Ok, thanks. Until then I'll just manually enter trades.

Hi Folks,

i discovered this thread on the weekend and decided to give the strategy a try. Well what can I say. It worked too good to be true today.

I opened positions in the following pairs:

USD/JPY with the original setup (TP15-30-50; S/L 30)

GDP/JPY slightly modified (TP 20-40-70; S/L 40)

Both have been closed already for +95 and +130pips.

You can't expect more on the very first day

Thanks to all the contributors to this system.

I want to take one point into discussion:

So far all the modifications in the different pairs all aimed to widen the SL/TP targets. What about the opposite way?

Maybe on some Pairs a 10-20-30 system would strike bigger Win/Loose Ratios?

Greets

BennyFX

--- 帖子 #1571 ---
I really appreciate your work. Thank you all for your effort.

As I went through all the pages of this thread on weekend i got pretty overwhelmed by all the modifications. Would be very kind of you to post a short abstract of the above mentioned settings.

I entered my first trades today with following settings:

USD/JPY 15-30-50

GDP/JPY 20-40-70

S/L fpr 3rd postion moved to Break-even when 2nd target was hit.

--- 帖子 #1572 ---
Hello bennyFX

For a general overview read post #1.

Here is summary of the various settings:

Mikelath's settings:  TP levels 15-30-50pips, SL 30pips, time to placing orders 10pm gmt, 17hr look back.

Pipnick's settings:   TP levels 15-30-50pips, SL 30pips, time to placing orders 8am gmt, 24hr look back.

My settings (GBP/JPY only): TP levels 40-80-110pips, SL 60pips, time to placing orders 10pm gmt, 17hr look back.

--- 帖子 #1573 ---
Thank you very much for your quick update.

Mike's and your setting have the advantage that the orders are already placed when the London session is opening. I'll observe all three of them and pass the trackrecord on to you.

--- 帖子 #1574 ---
Hi,

Yes, I use D95P-Reverse... and more pairs... all for testing the D95P-reverse technique... since everyone is testing D95P I just want to give a shot to D95P-REVERSE.

I have studied each losing position... and changed the REVERSE technique for the 'normal' D95P for some pairs, and for others keep the REVERSE.

I will continue my forward testing in order to check the most suitable pairs and the strategy for each one of them, in some pairs there will be profits and losses for others... after all... is just testing. After a long testing period I will be confident enough to go for REAL with the correct settings.

Regards!

I'm using daily95 EA on my live account with the EUR/JPY only. Made a sweet 95 pips yesterday on my north finance account. I've been using it for about a week live now. I did notice one day the EA didn't set both the sells and buys one day but only the buys were set. So I'm keeping my eye on it. I'm trading it live due to the great track record. Paris

--- 帖子 #1576 ---
Thank you for your clarification and contribution to this system .

And let me THANK again whoever who contributed to this system. the EA works perfectly

--- 帖子 #1577 ---
How can I use either of these EAs if I'm at work from 12P EST thru 9P EST? I can't set the EAs since I won't be around.

Thanks.

greeting all

just now i ve tried the D95P ea, unfortunately it appear that the ea version has expired..(?)..can anybody help me with this?

tq

--- 帖子 #1579 ---
4thSpace,

The point of an EA is so you don't have to be around.  To answer your question, you setup the EA anytime, tell it when to look back at the hi/lo, leave your computer on with the EA live and let it do its thing. The trick is to leave your computer on, MetaTrader running and connected to your broker when you are not home. The EA will then setup your long and short stop orders at the appropriate time of the day. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #1580 ---
could you summarize all the settings please..

thanks a lot..

Hi everyone,

I'm testing the D95P Standard (Odl Fall version 5.2) on my Odl account, but I'm having quite different results from the Mikelath's ones. Does it only depend on different brokers, or do I need to set some trailing stop maybe?

Thank you very much

Hello,

I'm new to this thread although I read most of it, but still have some questions. Pls forgive me if they are answered already (couldn't find the answers).

1. why are there different EA's for different brokers? Is it due to the brokers server time?

2. when I use D95P (Alpari Fall Version 5.2) I can't change any settings. Do I have to use the old Daily95pips.mq4 in order to change settings? Or are there other ways to do it?

Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #1585 ---
Individuals keep saying that they are making money but my system is not. I must be doing something wrong with my settings. When you say to place orders at a particular GMT time, does that mean to set the system to start at that time,since I am not sure how you would place manual orders. Please, Please help.

--- 帖子 #1586 ---
The times you need to pay attention to are GMT and the time your broker uses in MetaTrader. When someone mentions setting up trades at a specific time GMT, then you add or subtract from that number based on the time your broker uses.

For example: MikeLath's original posts suggest using the close of the trading day to look back at the previous 17 hours for the high and low. The end of the trading day is 22:00 GMT, 17:00 EST, etc. My broker uses CET, or GMT +1, so my setting should be hour 23, look back 17 hours and cancel order after 24 hours. Hope that helps. Give it some time if you haven't used EA's before.

--- 帖子 #1587 ---
Good Day every one,

I'm new here in this forum as well as in this Forex industries. Anyway, gone through this Daily95pips forum and it seems to be very convincing. Before I start to trade, there's something that I would like to check with you guys.

We shall key in our order base on the last 24 hours (17 hours by Mike) HIGH and LOW. Plus another 5pips. Just for an example:

USD /JPY

Long

last 24 hrs HIGH= 107.13 + 5pips

Short

last 24 hrs LOW=   105.33 - 5pips

Now, my question is, what happend if the market never rise up or never go down to any of the settings set. None of the order will be executed right?. So how to overcome this problem. What's the best HIGH and LOW settings?. Should we estimate the best HIGH and LOW?

Looking forward for replies from all you expert out there.

Thank You and Have a nice Day..

--- 帖子 #1588 ---
very bad day, almost every pair hit STOP L ...tomorrow we r gonna win win

--- 帖子 #1589 ---
That is correct no orders would execute.

No need to overcome the problem. At the end of the day, the pending orders will be deleted, and the next day High low will start up with a new high and low. So you would have one day that did not execute, but your next day probably will. It has happened to me a couple of times. I have never estimated a High low. I let the EA do all the work.

--- 帖子 #1591 ---
PipNick,

Thanks for your hard work in making these great EA's, but I can't seem to get them working on any live accounts, have tried with IBFX and ODL. Are the EA's made to only work on demo accounts? Is there any way to enable them to work on live accounts? Your help would be much appreciated.http://forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1592 ---
I think you should have read most of the thread. There are dozen ppl asking the same question " I can't run my EA on live account". The solution is to contact with the broker, some brokers need some documents to be faxed. I dunno about that. But to make it work on live account one should contact the costumer support service.

Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #1593 ---
I can another EA on my IBFX live account

But Pipnick EA(which PipHunter made) doesn't work.

Anyone else can use the EA in live account?

--- 帖子 #1594 ---
jphole,

You are correct, the daily95pips works on live (orginal one) but Pipnick's 5.2's don't.

Togu,

I wrote the question in hopes the PipHunter might see it and fix it. Hope he can.

--- 帖子 #1595 ---
I'm using D95P Standard (IBFX Fall Version 5.2).ex4 from Jan 6 and keep getting the message that this version has expired.  The version of MT4 from InterbankFX I'm using is 4.00 Build 211 (15 Oct 2007).  Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #1596 ---
it could be possible that the version for Pipnick is only valid for working on Demo accounts and not live accounts, the modification has to come from within the code to remove such restriction.

I use IBFX for live trading and they don't have any limitations on the excution of EAs in general.

I would use the original version of the EA and modify the settings to Pipnick's settings, I don't know the settings but I am sure they are present on this thread

--- 帖子 #1599 ---
PipHunter,

Can you change the code in these awesome EA's that you wrote so they can work on live accounts?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1600 ---
Hello - don't always have a chance to post but both the IBFX Standard Fall and IBFX PipNick versions are working for me in both demo and live accounts.

Great job PipHunter - too bad the markets have not been more cooperative...

A couple of suggestions:

Try downloading EA's again - THEN YOU MUST CLOSE THAT IBFX SESSION AND RESTART.

When you drag and drop the EA on the chart, do you get the smiley face or the 'X'?:

If the smiley face, then turn on the EA through its settings.

If the 'X', then click the 'Expert Advisors' tab on the top of the screen,     changing it from red to green - then you should get the smiley face.

Do you have other EA's running?  If not - try talking with IBFX for suggestions....

Hello shisuyu,

Two Questions:

How can you set three BreakEven values?

The main difference between yours and my results are depending on friday.

Friday was a perfect day for this setting. Why generate a negative result?

How is anyone running the daily95pips EA since it always throws up a message that it has expired?

--- 帖子 #1612 ---
Hi,

I just want to publish my results for the last week (20-25 Jan)

AUDUSD -165

EURCHF +226

EURGBP -120

EURJPY -102

EURUSD +200

GBPJPY -210

GBPUSD -45

USDJPY -195

Total: -411 pips (ouch again).

However... EURCHF and EURUSD have nice results, it seems that the technique change works...

EURCHF: In my 2+ years on forex I never liked the CHF... however... the results looks promising.

EURUSD: looks just fine... not bad +200.

AUDUSD: This is the last week for this pair, I tried with D95P and D95P-REVERSE... and nothing works with this pair.

EURGBP: Last week I worked with D95P on this pair, I checked each losing position, and it looks like the SL is too tight (30 pips).

EURJPY: Bad results, once more, I checked each losing position, and I will change my strategy, this week I will use D95P, last week I used D95P-REVERSE.

GBPJPY: This pair doesn't look good, neither the D95P nor D95P-REVERSE seems to work with this pair, maybe I will try Naranjoe' settings.

GBPUSD: -45 pips, can be considered break even? I think not, I will change my strategy to D95P (yes, I checked each losing position in order to make a move like this)

USDJPY: I will change to normal D95P, my analysis doesn't give me clue, sometimes works, sometimes does not...

Anyway,

D95P, works fine on EURJPY (track record),

Other pairs looks promising as EURCHF and EURUSD, and others needs tunning, I will try more settings and will keep the forward testing in order to get the best results/settings... for all of us.

More results anyone?

Regards!

Hello,

I've been reading this thread for some time. I read through most of the posts (not all I'm afraid), thanks for your work and sharing this information!

I am testing D95p using an external math package. I use 1 minute data (ask/bid) to backtest - ask-hi for buying, bid-lo for selling, s/l and t/p levels (a bit pessimistic, still huge amount of data). Not sure how realistic this is though. I'll post results if someone is interested. Some questions...

- there is a trailing stop version in the code; seems to be a good idea to let profits run in case of a real breakout. Did someone test that?

- There seem to be only compiled versions of the newer EA - is the source code for the current version available somewhere? I am running four currency pairs on a demo account, does not seem to work at the weekend.

- did someone think about volatility based adjustments of the levels (s/l, t/p)? This could be ATR or 17h high/low difference that is calculated anyway. Could make the whole

a bit more robust against market changes?

- If you look at the daily results, some days close with profit and on others, all trades are stopped out with max. loss. In those days, the reverse version would probably work fine. Did someone try to guess whether to take the normal or reverse version that day? I wonder how much better than 50% the accuracy of such a decision needs to be in order to be useful. When training a NN or a support vector machine, at least the question what would be expected as output would be clear (remains the question of input).

Regards - Martin66

It is a scam. Also, if you goto their website immediately run your anti virus protection programs. That website drops virus programs on your computer that steal your passwords.

--- 帖子 #1620 ---
I have been trading this type of system for the past two years manually and it works.

The Ea provided here is also a great piece of work ad I can see a lot of effort as been put into it.

We have two trading sessions the European open and the NY open and the Ea has shown that it is a good auto trader on either one.

It would be better if we had an option whether or not to delete the opposite order rather than the current versions that delete it automatically.

During a quick reversal and a major one, at that, the option to leave the opposite order in place, would be of benefit from my point of view.

Just a thought.

Also if PipNick could open up the Ea setting, so we can adjust the time zone to allow us to use it on the European Opening, as well, it would be great to test it on that market also.

You made a very good work in the past time with your overview of results.

Do you have an idea what is wrong?

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1628 ---
Great now that we can decide whether to delete the opposite order or not there are other things that should be concidered and I think are possible to make this work better.

Again I have traded these markets for the past tow years and have made consistent profits using the following system that should be easy to incorporoate in this EA. Keep in mind that some Majot traders use this system as well. I cannot speak to who they are but they are Major traders.

The rules they put down are quite simple Trades are made between Midnight EST and 3: am EST playing against the volatitity of the market at that time. Keep in mind also that since no news reports are released at these times the pips spread remains fairly stable. Trades ar eonly placed f the consolidation high to low is less than 80 pips apart. If so then the straddle is placed 20 pips above and below with a stoploss of 40 pips and a limit order of 40 pips. They trade the GBP/USD and the EUR/JPY.

The current EA placed three trades and will work fine but if it could read back and see if the consolidation is within the 80 pips and then placed the trades and if not within the 80 pips then place no trades this would eliminate some bad trades as we now see them.

I am sure that the EA could be adjusted to do this as it now looks back 17 or 24 hours then places the trades then it should be able to do the same , see if we are within the 80 pis and then make a decision to trade or not.

THere is another profitable system to this as well bu lets see if we can attack this problem first.

Also I have seen throughout his forum that we are trading the near NY open when the better time is the European open between Midnight EST and 3: am EST

Just a second though if we could also get the EA to trail the opposite order it would make a difference in profits as well.

In other words if we could decide whether or not to trail the opposite or not would be excellent.

Also change the take profit on the third order to 300 pips it makes a big difference and Order Expire to 72 hours

Hi Pheniox,

interesting ideas!

A question remains:

What time is right for look to the 80 pips range?

Time between 0 and 3 am EST or is it the time for look back hours?

i will try to improve these ideas into the EA and i try to program one EA for all brokers.

--- 帖子 #1632 ---
Hi naranjoe or anyone

Can you please clarify a few things for me on this strategy? I got lost in the threads:

1. Do we still use +5 pips to buy and -5pips to sell from high and low respectively.

2. What time do you place the orders in EST? Would it be at 6:00pm EST when the Asian session opens or 8:00pm EST 2 hours later?

3. Can it be used at midnight to capitalize on heavy market movement?

Simone

--- 帖子 #1633 ---
The rules they put down are quite simple Trades are made between Midnight EST and 3: am EST playing against the volatitity of the market at that time.

Taking this into concideration we are looking back 5 hours from midnight EST for any movement within the 80 pis range. If there is nothing more than 80 pips then we make the trades.

I have attached an indicator that show this quite well. I trade off it manually all the time using this system.If we could make an EA from this indicator it would be great as well.

Using the indicator we are looking for no 80 pip range within the red box. Use all default settings .

Also if we could make an EA from this indicator that would place a sell order and a buy order x amount of pips above and below the red box it makes for a perfect breakout EA on almost all currencies. I have made a lot of pips using this indicator as long as there is no expiry on the stop orders. I have made many 300 plus pips trades using this for a breakout indicator. It is open source so any member here is welcome to it.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1637 ---
Thanks Naranjoe, but what is the spread?

--- 帖子 #1638 ---
Hello simoneg

please learn the basics of trading first!!!

Ok, I will help but it is the last time.

Spread is the difference between the bid and asking price.

While trading forex, you will note that there will be a difference between

the current value of the currency and what you pay for it.

Please don't ask me what is bid and ask.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1639 ---
Thanks Naranjoe, respectfully, I am a trader, just testing this strategy...the way you used the word spread in your response was pretty vague, so i was basically asking for clarity.

--- 帖子 #1640 ---
It's just differences between brokers.  A good amount of the time they were slightly off from one another.  That changes the setting of the orders.  Spreads have differed between the two brokers.  NF seemed to lag more but also seemed more reliable somehow.  Were IBFX may have bounced and knocked out trades the NF would be slower and not catch certain moves that IBFX supposedly did.  This seemed to keep NF in the game more often than not.  I am interested in trying IKON Royal?  Some people have stated they're happy with them but who knows for sure.

My testing as of late has been on hold due to past computer issues but I'm anxious to get back into the game.

--- 帖子 #1641 ---
This makes sense to me.  We check for the 80 pips to see if the market has already moved a significant amount?  And if so then we don't bother.

--- 帖子 #1642 ---
Thanks for the response.

I think the differences can only a few pips and i consider to adapt the d95p settings

to make it more stable with different brokers.

I still do not know whether it works.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1643 ---
Hi Mike,

Try this idea for your Daily 95.  Make your 15pip profit trade with 3x lots, the 30 trade with 2x lots, and the 50 trade with 1x lot.

For example,

Make first trade at Buy with a take profit of +15    --- lot size = .03  (or 3)

Make first trade at Buy with a take profit of +30    --- lot size = .02  (or 2)

Make first trade at Buy with a take profit of +50    --- lot size = .01  (or 1)

The idea here is that hitting the nearby targets is more likely than hitting the far targets therefore bet heavier on the nearby target.  AND if the first target is hit, but not targets 2 & 3 you will cover your losses better when stopped out.

Give it a try and let me know what you think.

Good trading on you,

Tom Trader

--- 帖子 #1644 ---
hello to all,

i test this strategy in my demo, i have now one question: is it necessary to load the EA into a H1 chart ? (or is it regardless which timeframe the chart shows ? the mathematic analysis in the code uses however the data from the past out of the database and not from the chart ?

sorry for my bad english, school's out for (a long) summer...

sten

--- 帖子 #1645 ---
It's an interesting idea but on the days it doesn't hit the small profit it will lose more.  Wouldn't that just be a wash in comparison to what we are doing now?

--- 帖子 #1646 ---
Hi all,

I was thinking in the same direction than Tom here. I've been forward testing Naranjoe's settings with GBP/JPY and Mike's for GBP/USD for the last couple of weeks. I know 2 weeks is not an acceptable sample size, but only in 2 days (out of 14) the first profit target wasn't hit after the trades were triggered, while several times the market decided to turn the other way after the 1st TP was reached, resulting in an overall loss. It isn't necessarily true that this way, when no TP is hit, the losses would be higher. That is just a matter of money management. You have to play with your lot sizes according to your loss tolerance. I think this approach is worth a try, at least.

My $0.02

For my own curiosity I made some mods to the indicator you posted.  I applied boxes to show the TP levels at 15, 30, and 50.  In several cases it looks like a trailing SL on the last order would benefit greatly.  I also made another mod that included the first bar to the left where the red box is because it was not being accounted for the way it was written.  I will also make further mods to draw the red box in a different color if the high/low is greater than 80 pips.  Thoughts?

Also it looks like leaving the opposite orders open could be a benefit as well as some currencies would profit in both directions on some days.

--- 帖子 #1648 ---
Here are a few other charts...

--- 帖子 #1649 ---
Hello TomTrader

Wow, what kind of improvement!!!

First i thought like mtaboneweb and Middleastern that the losses are too high.

Then i have tested it myself with GBP/JPY and i am overwhelmed.

I test it with my results in recent weeks.

My performance in $ was doubled although the weeks were not very good.

Very very good, thanks for the idea.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1650 ---
Be careful on that one. Of course the result doubled. but this is because you obviousley used the double amount of lots i think.  instead of 3 positions in one direction, you applied (according to tom) 3,2 and 1 (=6) positions in one direction.  Just my thoughts on what may could have gone wrong.

--- 帖子 #1651 ---
take the calculation again by using the same amount of lots but split them up differently.

According to Tom:

Same Basis: 3 Lots.

3/6= 0,5

3*0,5= 1,5 Lot on the 15P Target

2*0,5=1 Lot on the 30P Target

1*0,5= 0,5 Lots on the 50P Target.

You will see that the results will differ from yours.

--- 帖子 #1652 ---
Yes, that's the way to calculate it. You have to consider always the same maximum loss instead of increasing the amount of money you put in it (i.e. the number of lots).

Naranjoe: If you have some free time, try to calculate your results in terms of dollars, not pips, because 1 pip with a 1.5 lot size (first TP target) is worth 3 times 1 pip with a 0.5 lot size (3rd TP target).

By the way, I think you misunderstood me. I do think that this strategy may have some advantages, putting more weight on the first TP order.

I am not having much free time these days, but as soon as I can I'll do some backtesting to compare results, both in terms of $$ and in terms of win:lose ratio.

By the way, the pip value in Alpari for GBP/JPY is $0.68. It seems that that's not the situation with other brokers.

Have fun...

Middleastern

--- 帖子 #1653 ---
bennyFX and Middleastern

you have misunderstood me.

I always calculate my results in dollars ($).

I dont't use 6 positions in one direction.

I use the original set with 3 positions.

I increase the lot amount as it has described by TomTrader.

Remember that i trade GBP/JPY with my setting 40-80-110 that explains my results.

The amount of pips remains the same.

This only increase the amount of $$$.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1654 ---
If those are the results it is really great, but I cannot follow your numbers. I mean, according to my math, the maximum profit you can make with this new lot arrangement would be:

1.5 lots at 40 pips TP = $60      (assuming 1 pip = $1)

1.0 lot at 80 pips TP  = $80

0.5 lot at 110 pips TP = $55

Total                   $195

The same applies to those days when the trades are triggered but all three trades are stopped out. Your maximum loss should be -180 (same risk involved), but you have days with -360 (somehow indicating that you may have doubled the lot size, or maybe the trades in both directions (longs & shorts) got triggered)

Tell me if I'm wrong here.

However, even if I'm right, I think the numbers will turn out showing more profit than with the 3 equal trades strategy.

Middleastern

--- 帖子 #1655 ---
Naranjoe, sorry for the misunderstanding...

You are indeed increasing your size lot, doubling each trade's size. This way, your risk also doubles, but we should keep the same money management, i.e. the same maximum loss. By doubling your size lots, you are in fact risking twice the money than before, and I think that was what Bennyfx was referring to.

Tom Trader increased the lot sizes indeed, but if you want to compare results with your original settings, you should maintain the same overall amount of money you put in the trades.

Hope I'm clear enough (it's late here and I've been the whole day working on the PC, so my brain is a little blurred).

Well, good night to you all.

Middleastern

--- 帖子 #1656 ---
I think you fool yourself with this results. (No offence)

But the answer is given by yourself:  "I increase the lot amount as it has described by TomTrader."

So you doubled your input.

--> More input = More output

This is why every result is exactly twice as high in $$$.

But you need to claculate the $$$ output on the same $$$ Basis!!

Fix the amount of $-input so you can't buy more Lots than before.

This is elemenary maths.

--- 帖子 #1657 ---
thanks for the testing.  I hadn't got around to that yet, but your tests confirm the worth of using a 3-2-1 loading for lot size.

Tom

--- 帖子 #1658 ---
Sorry, Naranjoe.  My addled brain just stopped working.

--- 帖子 #1659 ---
Naranjoe, bennyFX, and Middleastern.

Maybe it would help if we were all on the same page.

Do you agree that normally 1 lot = $100,000  and  .1 lot = $10,000?  Now I know that this will vary when 1 pip does not equal some power of 10 (1, 10, 100...) but my suggestion for lot size is simply the first (nearby) trade be weighted heaver than the second, and the second heaver than the third.  By how much is a personal choice, but if I am betting (and we are gambling here) then I am going to bet heaver on a setup that has a higher probability of winning.

If you really want to dazzle me, sit down and figure out the statistical probabilities  each trade has of winning.  My guess, and it is only a guess, is that you will find that the first trade's probability of winning is greater than twice the second, and the second is greater than twice the third.

Ok,  help me out here and give your input.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1662 ---
I have only read the post partially, but I think we can find a way to adapt the daily95 method in order to work. I am currently backtesting some alternatives and I think the problem stays this way:

- it only applies to pairs that are prone to "explode" (run stops, spike higher/lower, etc...) and that is GBP/JPY especially but EUR/NZD also. The spread on these pairs is 7.

- if some broker can offer us a spread of 7 for TRY or other very illiquid pair, please post it here so I can do some checking. Thank you

- from a logical point of view, we are just following the trend; what is illogical is risking 90 pips for 95, so I am currently backtesting only the 30 pips for 50 alternative

- we are looking for volatility in order to have fast moves covering a lot of ground, so it would be interesting to use a volatility indicator such as ATR or Bollinger Bands (if the price action closes outside the upper/lower BB it might be a sign of increased volatility in the next period). Options pricing in GBP/JPY might give us a clue of where the volatility stands at a given moment, but I have limited experience with options and maybe someone else here knows more.

- we also want to avoid the ranging days (which appear quite often in gbp/jpy as a matter of fact), so it would be interesting to compare the system 1) in days with market-moving news releases (like interest rate statement in GBP) and 2) in days with no news or limited importance news.

I think that in the end we will have a system, but not an automatic system because we will gauge in some factors that depend on our appreciation. Please tell me what you think.

Even a negative month proves nothing.  It doesn't prove the system isn't profitable long term.  Negative weeks and months will occur, it's all part of the game.

in long term i think is 50 50... just like betting game of baccarat.....

--- 帖子 #1669 ---
We are all demoing this approach, so it really doesn't matter how big the lot size is, for the time being. In order to know if this lot arrangement is better than the current  one (3 equal lot sizes), we should compare the results in terms of $ using the same settings, and this includes overall lot size (the three trades altogether), the three different TP's and the SL. Since Naranjoe already has his own forward testing results for a couple of months back, it would be great for us to compare his results with the results the new approach would have rendered.

Right now I have no available time to do that, but as soon as things get slower here I surely will.

Naranjoe, if you can tell me in which post you put your latest results (all of them), it would be great.

Best to you all.

EURGBP -90

EURJPY -354

EURUSD -330

GBPJPY -41

GBPUSD -420

Here are my results for: 03-Feb - 9-Feb.

AUDUSD -75

EURCHF +15

EURJPY +272

EURUSD +141

GBPJPY +90

GBPUSD +30

USDJPY +30

Total +503 pips

Comments: Finally!! (again) FINALLY! nice results! Is the market changing?.

As usual, I check every losing position... and I have decided to start two instances of MetaTrader... one for D95P and other for D95P-REVERSE, so I can compare hand-to-hand the results between the techniques... also I have attached a file about the best trading hours I will study and try the best entry hour for each pair.

By the way, AUDUSD, no more testing for this pair.

More results anyone?

Hi dude,

It notin much. its as simple as making some "edit" as i call it, to the original tech.

I discovered that not all trade actually hit TP, but certainly all 15pips TP were breached and taken, so i had to use common sense, so to say.

It's like this, I placed all my trades 15pips TP with 30pips SL.

As usual, entry is high + 5pips = Buy

Low - 5pips = Sell

Thats all i did.

If u've got any quest.. u can get bak to me.

Not offensive, just discussion.

I am aware that prices are not going straightline.  However, generally, don't u think that d95p and d95p-reverse are same thing?

again, i understand price doesn't go straight, but ur losing month of reverse is highly likely ur winning month of d95.

--- 帖子 #1678 ---
Dear David:

I think that it makes great senses by using a stoploss wider than TP, since this is a random luck system.  bingo, u r my man.

--- 帖子 #1679 ---
Hi Charvo,

D95P and D95P-REV follow the same basic setup (HIGH / LOW +/- 5), however, D95P assumes a trending market... D95P-REV assumes a bounce on the natural resistance/support of the day before.

I have tested both... and casually yesterday on EURJPY there was profit on both D95P (+15) and in D95P-REV (+133).

So, my testing try to find which pair/technique/start hour combination fits the best.

Thanks for your comments.

Hi,

If a place a position on 30SL and 15TP, that's a 2:1 profit ratio... I mean, if I loose just once... I have win twice in order to just break even. Too much effort to get 0 pips.

Regards!

Christancho

--- 帖子 #1681 ---
Discussions are welcome.  Hey, firstly, i hate to talk in mathematics. so just try to be plain. it's like this:

i think that this system, is a random luck system.  using previous day's HH to buy, is not really indicating that we are following bull.  neither is previous LL.

no matter what direction u go, and no matter what level u go from, it is a matter of random luck in long term.  check those candles, two consecutive bearish candle, but u still can possibly win profit, if u buy from previous HH.  it happens frequently.

we are not doing a trend following system, since this is a one-day trading system.  if we talk about trend-following or contrarian, we may be joking.

now, why 15 TP with 30 SL is better than 30 TP with 30 SL, in my humble opinion, is because, generally, more than 50% likely, it is easier to reach 15 than 30.  forget about directions, imagine u ask John and Tom, two random men, everyday, u command: run! John and Tom.  Since John's task is 15 feet, and Tom's goal is 30 feet,  after many many years, who won most by finishing his job earlier everyday? It should be John.

when consider profit/loss ratio, probability must be involved.  we cannot say that 30 SL vs 15 TP is like 2:1 risk/return ratio.  That's wrong, because we didn't consider probability.

Again, since i said price not moving in straightline, it is of coz frequently seen like eur/jpy profit in both ways.

thanks, i like discussions, please.

David, are you entering your pending orders just before the Asian session? I mean, you still use the high and low of the 17 hours before 5pm East/10pm GMT (from 5am to 10pm GMT)?

Thanks

Middleastern

--- 帖子 #1686 ---
Just my 2 cents, i also expect David to comment on this.

My 2 cents is that 5 pm US est, is not a good time to enter, why? simply because many traders are still on market pushing waves.

Then when is a better time? better time is after 6pm or 7pm.

I am sure both 6 or 7 pm (us est) are less volatile than 5 pm. But I am not sure which one is better, i choose 7 in winter, because asian ppl still in bed then.

Hello Tom,

Well, I did some manual testing with Naranjoe's settings for GBP/JPY, with one addition. I tested from January 2 to Feb 12, placing the orders at  midnight GMT. I checked which trades were triggered, and which TP's were hit, adding another smaller one (25, 40, 80 and 110 pips). Here it is:

Total days tested: 28 (25 + 3 no-touch days. I am considering n=25)

...............n....... %

TP=25:             ....20.....                           80

TP=40: ....14                           .....56

TP=80:             ....12                           .....48 (one trade ended the day at -35)

TP=110:....             9                           .... 36 (two trades ended the day at +50 and -35)

Broker was Alpari.  Those of you forward testing these settings are welcome to share your results. Timing, I found out, has a lot to do with these numbers. If any of you have better results with a different ordering time, let me know and I'll check that out. Some trades were just at the high or low point at midnight GMT, and that's why they "got triggered" immediately.

Will be waiting for your feedback. Regards

Middleastern

--- 帖子 #1691 ---
Good,

as i told you b4, i place my trades b/w 5-6 am GMT, i take my entries like this

Buy:   Previous days high + 5pips

Sell:   Previous days Low - 5pips

TP = 15 pips

SL = 30 pips

SL for GBPJPY = 40 pips

TP for GBPJPY = 20 pips

--- 帖子 #1692 ---
Middleastern and everyone,

Have been trading using the most recent high +5 and most recent low -5 for entry.  That is, I look backward on a 1hour chart from midnight GMT (5:00pm EST) for the last high point and the last low point, then use them to base the entries on, even if those points happened in the last hour or two.

Also have found that the AUDUSD pair works quite well, better than the EURUSD pair.

Good luck to all,

TomTrader

--- 帖子 #1693 ---
Great men, well 2day i got bad hit,

Price hit SL and returned back, dunno y i got that hit, what do u think

middleeastern?

--- 帖子 #1694 ---
Dear Middleastern

You may have hit the jackpot here.  Based upon your data on the GBP/JPY pair, you say you are hitting the TP=25 approximately 80% of the time.  If you have a system that has an 80% win/loss ratio then you have a real money maker.

Where do you have your stop loss set at?  If it is at 25, then your score should look something like this:

2 losses @ 25 pips = 50 pip loss

8 wins   @ 25 pips = 400 pip wins

-------------------------------------

Net gain = 350 pips  (GREAT!!!)

thanks,

TomTrader

--- 帖子 #1695 ---
Hi Tom,

SL was as Naranjoe's settings = 60 pips. As you see, the risk/reward ratio is 60:25, which is not the best, but if the win/lose ratio is around 80%, I guess it is compensated.

HOWEVER, I just tested it on 28 days, which is in no way whatsoever a significant sample, statistically speaking. I'll check the previous months on GBP/JPY, and as soon as I have some results I'll post them.

It would be great if someone could do the same with another pair, to have a more robust base.

Another thing to have in mind is that betting only on the smaller TP's will keep us out of the big rides. There is a trade off here, higher win/lose ratios in exchange of the big trends. We will always be able to put bigger lot sizes to overcome this, provided that the win/lose ratio consistenly stays at those levels, what has yet to be proved...

Regards

Shit happens... A small TP is no guarantee it will be hit.  Sometimes 1 single pip makes all the difference...

Middleastern

--- 帖子 #1697 ---
Hi Middleastern,

Am running forward (paper traded) testing on the AOD/USD and USD/JPY pairs, using a ST=25, TP=25 strategy.  I think you're right, a higher win/loss ratio is preferable to big runs that may never hit their take profit targets.

Given a 80% win ratio, you can build on lot sizes like you say and keep on sustaining winning trades.

BTW, I made an earlier suggestion to use the most recent high & low as the entry levels (+-5), but now I am not so sure that was a good idea.  Since then I have went back to the high&low of the last 17 hours.

Let me know what your testing tells you,

thanks

Tom

Results of GBP/JPY for week ending friday 15 february 2008 with my settings 40-80-110 pips

and Update to BreakEven 80 pips.

Monday 11 February 230 PIPS

Tuesday 12 February -180 PIPS

Wednesday 13 February 230 PIPS

Thursday 14 February 120 PIPS

Friday 15 February -180 PIPS

Total 220 PIPS

Back on the road of pips

From next week i will change the timeframe for trading with gbp/jpy.

I will set my orders at 2am GMT to avoid some bad trades (like today).

The LookBackHours should remain the same.

I have backtested my results with the new timeframe and i think there are more pips to make.

For example, this week I would get 730 pips.

Of course, not all the weeks have better profits, but I think this timeframe is better over a long period.

Very interesting Naranjoe indeed Is there a particular reason why 2 GMT?

One question to make sure I got this correct: the lookback will be 4 hours longer, i.e. 05 GMT - 02 GMT right?

Keep it up and keep making pips

--- 帖子 #1701 ---
Hello Ykb,

1.

No, that's just from the backtesting i think this is the better choice.

Look at the post of Arkpip, he has chosen a similar time with a similar outcome on gbp/jpy.

2.

No, LookBackHours are same as the original, 17h (2am GMT - 9am GMT).

Hello Tom and everyone out there,

I apologize if this is a little bit off-topic, but I think it is interesting. I've back-tested two pairs, from Aug 1, 2007 to Feb 15, 2008 (Broker = Alpari. Trading days: Monday to Friday only) using smaller TP's. Here are the results:

EUR/GBP

SL = 30; TP's = 15, 20 & 30

Orders placed at 08 am GMT. Look back hours = 16. Buy stops at High+5; Sell stops at Low-5. The backtesting was done manually on the 1H chart.

.................TP

............15        ...20            ...30

..........n    %    ..n    %      ..n    %

[+]            ...91  74   77  63    68  55

[-]            ...32  26   46  37    55   45

Total days tested = 139. Total no-touch days = 16 (No-touch days were not considered to calculate the percentages)

GBP/JPY

SL = 50; TP's = 30, 40 & 50

Orders placed at 08 am GMT. Look back hours = 16. Buy stops at High+5; Sell stops at Low-5. The backtesting was done manually on the 1H chart.

................TP

..........30        ....40             ....50

.........n   %       ...n   %          ..n   %

[+]   ...99  75   91  69     85  64

[-]          ...33  25   41  31     47  36

Total days tested = 139. Total no-touch days = 7 (No-touch days were not considered to calculate the percentages)

Comments:

On the EUR/GBP I considered positive days also those that had a positive result at 8 am GMT of the next day, but their TP was not yet hit (and there were many of those). For a qualitative test, I think this does.

This pair has a very low daily range (mean = 43 pips in the last 180 days), and that's why I took it - a pair with a behavior opposite to that of GBP/JPY.

On GBP/JPY, the TP's were always hit. Something I noticed (and for many of you I'm sure this is not news), is that this pair jumps quite a bit on the early hours of the London session. I chose 8 am GMT to place the orders because of my time zone (GMT+2), and it turned out to be a good choice, it seems. On this pair, it may be a good idea to use a small trailing stop instead of a TP in order to lock  profits and enjoy some of the eventual big moves.

I think the direction to follow on this approach is to define the TP's based on the average daily ranges of each pair during the last 2 weeks/3 weeks/month (?), to optimize them. It would require a re-check of the daily ranges every two weeks or so to adapt the TP's to the current behavior of each specific pair - If it was trending in the last weeks, expand the TP's. If it was ranging, reduce them.

Well, some food for thought. Comments and suggestions are expected.

same question again, why does the ea don't trade on mondays ? i use alpari uk, there is no saterday trading allowed and thats why i get no candle for this day. Wher can i setting up that the ea use for his analysis the friday OHL ?

thanks and regards

Hey I'm having the same problem.

--- 帖子 #1706 ---
Hey guys,

I've been reading up on this thread for a couple of weeks now - this is the first time I've ever put any input into FF at all

I just had a few questions regarding the EA.

Sc David - I went over your settings and have made them the same (I've used EA's before) I've been having trouble understanding your hourly settings - I've read the documents for 'The best times to trade.pdf' and I am guessing that the London session is the most volatile and there for the one that would have the most successful results. You say you set your trades between 5am - 6am GMT - could you please explain to me in terms of settings in the EA - like is the Day Start Hours still 21? Look Back Hours still 17? etc - a picture would be great   I am using ODL Securities - I've tried to work it out with the hours and I even downloaded a World Clock, makes no sense to me heh. -  however the last two days they haven't triggered at all, and I couldn't figure out why - it wasn't untill I was looking at some pictures of people's settings that I noticed they had the EA running on 1 Hour charts and I thought dang no wonder, so hopefully they will initiate this time around.

I will post my results as time progresses - I am going to trial this on 3 different computers with 3 different settings for 3 months with 6 of the most volatile pairs to see which results are better.

Any imputs on what settings are working best would be great.

Thanks guys and keep up the good work,

Happy pipping.

Bradsta,

Hi there. I thought I am going to come back to this thread and continue to help it with research, analysis and so on.

--- 帖子 #1708 ---
I have been toying with Fibo based TPs that is calculated based on the previous days range. Well we will see.

--- 帖子 #1709 ---
Hey guys,

I am having trouble getting the EA to work - it's been 4 days now and I have tried different settings each day it doesn't work.

I have gone from a Daily chart with the EA attached to a 1 hour chart with the EA attached, I have Expert Advisors enabled and I have the smiley face.

I don't understand why it's not working - I have tried ODL and now IBFX and the same result. I have the Internet and the computer running 24/7 I have tried restarting Metatrader on both brokers to make sure everything was refreshed and what not.

Can anyone help me understand what I'm not doing right please?

--- 帖子 #1710 ---
Unfortunatly I am not an EA expert as I never use them. Like to do things manually. Hope others can help.

--- 帖子 #1711 ---
Attempts to isolate errors.

1. Download the Daily 95 Pips (IBFX Fall Ver..mq4 from the attachment Page.

2. Start MT4 without any EA's attached.

3. Attach D95P EA only to one chart (for example EUR/USD).

4. Check inputs of the EA (for test purpose set the DayStartHour to the next full hour of your Broker)

Wait and see if something happens when the hour has begun.

See in the Journal tab of MT4 if there are errormessages.

If it still does not work, please report again.

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1712 ---
Thanks Naranjoe - It worked!

Hah - and I think I know why it wasn't working before, it was because the EA magic number was the same on all the pairs I was using. If I am correct it should be working perfectly fine next time it triggers. I have changed the number differently on each pair.

Thanks so much for your time Naranjoe

Cheers,

Bradsta

@ naranjoe

any idea for the "monday problem" ?

thx

hm,

i really do not know what's wrong.

Ok, we need some additional information.

How big is the difference from your local time to broker time?

Have you monday when your broker still has sunday?

Naranjoe

--- 帖子 #1715 ---
Hey Naranjoe.

What you told me to do worked, for one pair - but when I try to use say 5-6 pairs with the EA, and I change the magic  number on all of them so that they are different it doesn't work.

Any hints?

Thanks,

Bradsta,

--- 帖子 #1716 ---
Well, I've tried it again - I have checked to see if there were any errors, and as far as the report I got it should be working.

No trades are being placed but if I look under 'Experts' it gives me this:

I wonder if there is a glitch or something - I can't understand why it wouldn't be working.

Alright - I think I worked it out.

For anyone who may be having the same problems as me, try not using a trailing stop for the 3rd order. Seems to be some sort of glitch.

They all came up on the last hour with no trailing stop - so I dunno...

See how goes

Hey Mike glad to see you back....I have been away from this thread also. have you changed any of the rules to your system? and what is pipnik?

Congrats on your results and consistancy also.

--- 帖子 #1720 ---
Hi johnedoe.

I'm using the same rules as post#1...the only change I've made is axing USDJPY from the list leaving EURJPY and EURUSD. There has however been a few new ideas presented on the thread that you may want to catch up with...

PipNick uses different settings and was posting some great results for EJ and GU, so I thought to do a comparative with those settings/pairs and mine...thus the D95P and PipNick results.

--- 帖子 #1721 ---
Hi Naranjoe, I have one question I hope you may answer.

I know you provide statistics for every weekday, but do you actually open position every day, or just keep watching the market? For example, if you are already +300 pips on Wednesday, do you still keep trading for the rest of the week or rather start the next week?

Thanx

--- 帖子 #1722 ---
Hi Ykb

I make the trades every day.

Stop above a certain amount, i have also been thinking and that can protect you from loss.

On the other hand it can protect from profit

Who know.

Hey Naranjoe,

I use the same settings as you do (in fact, thanks for sharing this setup)

Settings for GBP/JPY:

TP = 40-80-110

SL = 60

Update to BE = 80 mostly, but actually no rule for me here, it depends on the market/price action, sometimes I move SL to BE, sometimes to the 1 TP, sometimes I just close the trade. I don't use any EA's, I modify all trades manually.

LookBackHours = 17

DayStartHour = around 10 PM EST

I don't see how you got negative GBPJPY trades this week. I'm using OANDA as my trading platform, maybe your broker's spread is different. Please see the attached file where it shows my GBP/JPY trades for this week (only two days were hit, 19 and 21 Feb)

Blue and yellow squares are the limit orders, triangles are the triggered ones and green dots are the TP's (1,2 and 3). Pink squares are the trades closed.

(EST 10:00 PM is 1:00 AM in my country, please dont get confused with the chart time)

Kindly,

Arkpip

Hello,

as I live in Europe, it is quite hard for me to respect 5pm EST for setting up the positions. Is it also possible to prepare the trades at 0600 am GMT? This time would correspond with my work cycle. Thanks 07nioe

--- 帖子 #1728 ---
i believe that u may just find a peaceful time to do it.

say, ur euro time's early morning will be ok, i suggest, because, ultimately, u just want to enter when market is quiet without noise, but before market wakes up.

Hi,

That is what I am doing. I live/work in London. Pretty much I start to work at around 8 am. So around 6 am GMT I set up my stuff. I do not have any problems so far. The main thing is the consistency.

Arkip,

saw your cooments to naranjo, i am confused a little, i too use oanda but got stopped on the 21st @ 210.14 and on the 21th at 210.67. You did not.

I set at 00:00GMT and look back 17 hrs with similar settings to you and naranjo.  Am i setting too early and not getting your results or am i missing something else?

Help appreciated

Hey Harve,

As I said above, I set my positions around 10 PM EST (that is 1 AM where I live and 4 AM GMT). I also wait for the 1-hour candlestick to close if at that time the price is actually the highest/lowest one (if you see my chart you will notice that on Feb 20 the limit order was set at 11 PM EST). Hope this could clarify a little.

Kind regards,

Arkpip

Hello,

I haven't understood which high and low I have to consider for Monday orders. Mikelath told us to go back as far as 00:00 EST on Friday. Does it mean that I have to include the complete Friday movements. And what does it mean for Central European Time? And my last question: Isn't it a little bit risky to set up a 30 pips SL independent of the TP? Thank you for your answers, 07nioe

Then yes you go back and take the movement of the whole Friday.

What do you mean you set up 30 pips SL independent of the TP? When you put your order you specify both SL and TP. You put through 6 orders. Please read again the first page especially the implementation/execution part.

Hi,

I started using GBP/JPY with the following settings:

EA=D95P(IBFX Fall Version)

Margin=2

SL=80

BE=55

TP=60,90 &110

Day Start=0:00

LookBackHrs=9

with good results when Backtested. How can I prevent the use of the  Sunday Data instead of Friday Data, without having to enter manually on Sundays. Today this ended in a loss, where it should have been a nice profit.

Anybody?

Thanks

Hi,

I just want to publish my forward testing results....

I have received many questions about which technique is the best... D95P or D95P-REVERSE.... so, I made a hand-to-hand forward testing... and here are the results...

Personally I can say that both tecniques are good... it's all about the pair... take a look to EURUSD, USDJPY consistent profit on D95P. Look at GBPUSD on D95P REVERSE, what do you think of EURJPY and USDJPY on D95P-REVERSE? will you trade live based on this results?.

So, which one is the best? let me know what you think.

Regards!

Christancho

nice work, keep going for 2 more months.

now we can't say which one is better, since ur results are too few, statistically INsignificant.  At least more than 30 trading days are needed.

Please can someone  write a short ebook on this trading system ?

Reading almost 2000 posts is no mean feat and the possibility of missing vital information is dangerous.

i also believe every new member who joins this thread  will ask questions that  has already been answered over and over again

the e-book can be updated regularly as changes come up

Please help

--- 帖子 #1757 ---
That would be great if some one writes an ebook.

--- 帖子 #1758 ---
i agree, that would be great. at the moment arkpip and narajoe have different settings. It would be nice to get some clarity.

--- 帖子 #1759 ---
Page 1, Post 1. Otherwise 60sl 40-80-110tp for gj. Traded eu,ej,gj. That is all you need to know.

--- 帖子 #1760 ---
Also. You need to stick to one setting for a very long period. Say years. If you change constantly there is no benefit and that also means different systems. Stick with one thing.

--- 帖子 #1761 ---
Does the EA automatically cancels opposite trades if one side of the trades are triggered e.g; if long trade is triggered does it cancel the short trades? if not can it be done through this EA?

Thanks for your help.

Mikelath, Naranjoe, Arkpip, mtaboneweb, guys what happened to you? Did you migrate to some other forum?

--- 帖子 #1765 ---
I have been working on a variation to this thread.  I have completely written my own EA and been testing over the last 2 weeks.  Last night it ran perfectly and produced 1,567 pips for 1 night.  Some currencies didn't trade and others were to tight on the S/L so I have made some adjustments which will be better on some pairs.

If anyone is interested I will post more about the strategy later.  I would like to continue testing the remainder of the week to make sure all the bugs are worked out.

Thanks much to Pheniox for pointing me in what I believe will be a very profitable direction.

Hi mtaboneweb,  Thank you and please share your settings, since I've been experimenting with Lookback hours = 8, but could not get all the pairs to constantly produce as many pips. The only "stable" pairs were GBP/USD & GBP/JPY and it seems that ea pair has to have its own S/L & B/E settings. I found GBP/JPY to work best as follows:

BE = 55

S/L = 80

T/P = 60, 90, 110

Thanks

Some thoughts and results for those interested.

I have been manually testing the following system for a few months:-

Pairs: GBP/USD & EUR/JPY

Start Time: 8am GMT

Look back: 24hrs

Pip Targets: 15, 30, 50

S/L: 30 pips

Change order to B/E: 30 pips

Apart from the start time and lookback, this system is essentially as Mike's original on page 1.

The attached spreadsheet has the following worksheets

Trades - Details of each every trade

Daily Summary - Results for each day

Analysis - Results for each pair broken down by pip target (inspired by mtaboneweb's recent post).

The system started very well before xmas but then struggled early in the year. It has since picked up again and for the 2 pairs has yielded 1334 pips for 63 trading days (avg 21.17 per day) - not bad at all.

However, from the analysis you will see the 30 pip profit target is barely profitable. The 15 pip target is most profitable. Over the same period the system would have yielded 2205 pips if the 3 orders were all placed with a 15 pip target.

To state the obvious, a high probablity strategy can negate the need for a high reward to risk ratio. although I acknowledge this strategy has only been tested over a very short period of time.

Naranjoe - if possible I would be interested to see similar analysis for gbp/jpy if you have the data.

Be interested in anyone elses thoughts on this.

Cheers

Nick

Hi everyone,

I just want to share my forward testing results.

This is a clear comparison between D95P and D95P-Reverse techniques...

I think the system is not profitable in the long run... at least with the tested pairs and with the default settings.

I don't plan to continue more forward testing.

If someone has more forward testing results, please share them with everyone of us.

Hi Christancho,

the main problem is the TP of 50 pips ?

usually did you get the TP of 15 pips?

and what do you think of using just a TP of 10,15, 30  pips

and SL  of 20 pips?

thank you for your help

--- 帖子 #1791 ---
Hello! I am brand new here, but have been reading and learning on FF for months now.

I have really enjoyed trying this system out to great results.  I use only the 15 and 30 TP with a 30 SL and a trailing stop on the 30. I assume my recent good fortune is due mainly to some great trends, so I am working on the second strategy which was said to work great in a ranging market. So far - I am not doing so well with it. I wonder if I understand it wrong - I have read through the first 30 or 40 pages and then back the last 5 or so. What I did was cut and pasted all the posts explaining it and pieced together a spreadsheet that has:

Previous Day's High

Previous Day's Low

Calculate Range

Calculate 10% of Range

Identify if closing is near the high or the low

Entry point

Stop Loss (30)

Take Profit (15)

Take Profit (30)

Then same as the first strategy I put a trailing stop of 30 on the 30 TP.  I wonder if my problem is that I am not using it in a true ranging market. I tried it with the CAD and it broke out and made a big move opposite of my entry order.  Then last night I was looking at the Kiwi and it seemed kinda range-ish, so I put the orders on it and of coarse this morning it fell in what would be a lovely trade, but alas - was falling directly opposite to the order I placed. Hmmm....  Good thing its fake money! I moved the SL this morning to let it cook some more and maybe it will pop back up.

Were there more variations to the ranging strategy that I missed? Are my SL and TP's too large or small? Can anyone recommend a true ranging pair for me to try this on?

Also - one other problem I am having with the ranging strategy is that the closing price was directly in the middle of the former day's high and low, so determining to go long or short was a coin toss.  Is there a better way to determine which order to place or a rule for when its in the middle?

Please be gentle with me - I am new to Forex, I have been studying it for about 6 months now, but have yet to go live.

Thanks!!

Hi

I check the following

for GBP/USD

Buy: Make first   Buy at
(last day high) + 5 pips
with a take profit of +15 --- lot size = .02 (or 2)

Buy:Make second Buy  at
(last day high) + 25 pips
with a take profit of +15 --- lot size = .01 (or 1)

(the same for Sell)

------------

in that way you will close the first position and only after it continue another 5 pips (you get a confirmation), you will open a new position

-----------

I make 357.6pips in the last 11 days approx.

------------

please check it, and let me know what do you think and if i need to change add something...

Hi all,

thanks for your work on this system. I ran a forward test on an Alpari demo account since Jan 08, see the result below. The first frew trades on this account were some other stuff - not all of the initial DD is caused by Daily95pips. I am using the Alpari fall version with the following settings:

SL  Upd. to BE  TP1 TP2 TP3

GBPJPY 60   15         40  80  110

EURJPY 30   15         13  30  50

EURUSD 30   15         15  30  50
GBPUSD 30   15         15  30  50

You see that I made some typos when entering the expert parameters... The server did not run all the time, so maybe I was lucky with the trades?

Result in $:
EURUSD 1087
EURJPY -571

GBPJPY -282

GBPUSD 52

Does this look OK...? EURUSD looks particularly good, is this just luck?

Martin:

The E/U does perform very well with this method.  I backtested a system where I entered at 5 pips above/below for the E/U, G/U and entered at 11% ATR(14) above/below for G/J, E/J.  I calculated and entered my trades at midnight eastern.  After manually backtesting 2 years of this strategy I had banked 45,000 pips.  I went live with this strategy on November 1, 2007 and after two months had profited 3600 pips.  I switched to a different broker in January and have yet to be able to reproduce that profit (break even for the year).  I plan to continue to trade the E/U as a supplement to my other trading strategies.

and which SL do you use for E/U, G/U ?

Can you send your report?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1810 ---
The formatting of this table got lost... GBPJPY: 60 SL, update SL to break even at 15 (these are all parameters you enter in the EA).

--- 帖子 #1811 ---
Unicla:

My entry for the G/J, E/J was not 5 pips off hi/lo but rather 11% ATR(14) off hi/lo.  G/J is very volatile, so the ATR is usually 200-300 pips per day.  I would take 11% of the ATR(14), add that to the hi, subtract from the low for my entry to ensure a true breakout.  For example, G/J ATR(14) is 2.50, so I would enter the market 28 pips above the high, below the low for the day.

Here were my settings for each of the four pairs:

E/U:  enter at 5, TP at 15, 30, 50, SL at 25 (trailing stop on 3rd order)

G/U:  enter at 5, TP at 15, 30, 50, SL at 30 (trailing stop on 3rd order)

E/J:  enter at 11% ATR(14), TP at 15%, 30%, 55% ATR(14), SL at 60 (trailing stop on 3rd order)

G/J:  enter at 11% ATR(14), TP at 15%, 30%, 55% ATR(14), SL at 75 (trailing stop on 3rd order)

Bioquim

--- 帖子 #1812 ---
Do you mean ATR of 14 1h bars? This would be just looking one day back. Or do you use 14 days? This might be more stable.

Anyway the question is how the parameters could be adjusted depending on market conditions. ATR certainly seems to be a good idea to cope with different volatilities. Another possibility would be to periodically optimize the parameters for optimum result (using a robust measure). For example you could run an optimization each weekend, finding optimal settings based on the data for the last four weeks and use this setting for the next week.

Ideally we would also know when to apply our system... it works best on a trending market, I think. If there is little movement within a small range, we lose mostly.

--- 帖子 #1813 ---
The ATR(14) is 14 days not hours.  This strategy does well with trending, but take a look back in the thread to find a D95 Reversal method that is good for ranging markets.  I have attached the template I have used for setting up my trades.  Update the top left with Highs, Lows & ATR and the entries will be updated.

--- 帖子 #1814 ---
Hi Bioquim,

Could you substantiate the reasons why you couldn't profit after changing the Broker after January'08.

BTW, not able to open the Excel File. Can you please reattach it.

Thanks !

--- 帖子 #1815 ---
I could open it.

--- 帖子 #1816 ---
thanks

and the SL for E/U

and G/U ?

and TP

You get these result, using a pip value of US$1 ?

all the best

--- 帖子 #1817 ---
Please see the table above, it's all in there (SL Update to BE, TP1-3)

I used a 1% risk for the position size in the EA - so $/pips depends on position size used for a particular trade. See the EA for calculation of position size.

In any case, I'd use none of the settings in this thread blindly for real trading. I'd use them as a starting point for a thorough backtest with some kind of robustness figure. I will work on the EURUSD as it behaved quite nicely - but this might change...

--- 帖子 #1818 ---
Hello, Can anyone here explain a little bit about EST, CET and GMT? it seems so many standards, not easy to follow up with.

I have been tracking Hans123 and a few of its varieties. I started the first version called 110K, it seems pretty robust, this one delivers 50% of return since Mar.23rd upto now.

Last week, I checked out Hans123, GaoXing, and Breakout-Trend2. those are variety of Hans123, the results were mixed among these, of course, I understand it is too early to conclude their potentials given less than one week demo trading. I will feedback you my testing result after a reasonable periods.

In doing these demoing, I have a couple of concerns which need to be clarified. since I demo trade what ever was given to me from the forum, so, the demoing seems blindly followed. If could have better visibility as to the reason why those settings were choose, then I guess I/we may have a base to choose set of parameters which we feel comfortable and form our own style. the parameters I am referring to are the SL/TP/BE, as well the start and end sessions. maybe there are no specific reason, but, I think at least there are statistical observation to determine such base.

Sincerely wish some one could put his/her comment to help with a comprehensive understanding of using such system or its similarities.

I thank you in advance

I think the concept still on resistance and support of price. some ranging market is working with system but it still have risk to be considered. If ur sure 100% then ur can enter the price. But it seem not sure the market will go down or up or ranging. It need to be added with other indicator to eleminate the risk but looking to movements.

Same with me, I already study the system. It can give good result if ur sure that the market not ranging at all.

Has anyone tried to use the Reverse EA on a different timeframe? when i place it on a 30min chart, it seems to execute different paramaters then what is in the inputs. Is the look back hour mean hour or does it mean time period of the chart it is on?  One more,? If the look back does mean time period the chart is on, a look back of 6 on a 30 min chart should give same results as a look back of 3 on a 1 hr chart, but it does not.  Any adivce as to learn more about using the different timeframes for this EA.

thank you

Hi,

I don't know about the reverse version, but I have been trying out the standard one for about one month now on a demo. I am preparing to go live soon, if profits keep up.

This system highly depends on the settings of BE, SL and TP. E.g. lower BE and SL on G/J gave me huge losses, but higher values gave me profit. I am also trying this on E/U, and it seems good. The returns are lower on this pair, but the shifts are also smaller, so perhaps somewhat safer.

But I am still not sure if it is safe enough to go live. Will my results stand, or will different market conditions give losses? All opinions are appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1825 ---
normally there have 3 pair will give a good result on box methods.

GJ, GC and GU - but it still need to study the time the pip exit the box..... normally gu is the best if happen exit on

us open....

for GJ and GC - on europe open. but beware on us open it will bounce back due to exchanging of euro to us...... but still depending to indicator.......

still dont have any standard result to show to u all. it different with the condition......

sorry

Hello, i'm trying this system, and have some questions.

Could you explain what that mean "periodBegin", "periodEnd" and "BoxEnd" mean?

it's a periodBegin - 17:00 EST or what, periodEnd-? BoxEnd-?

can you tell this times in GMT

--- 帖子 #1828 ---
you dont have to trust me but listen to me well, going live after trying this on demo is a different thing. Live is a different beast compared to demo. I stay live and I don't demo that's the only way you learn. I dont post much because I'm more focused on trading than debating on forums. but believe me your results will differ on a live account. Ive done this strategy for quite a while and it's pretty decent. When you need a little extra coin here and there without putting much effort and then diverting your focus on analyzed and planned trades. anyways no luck needed try your hand going live, you'll never go back to demo.

--- 帖子 #1829 ---
Here are some forward testing results.

They cover a period of 96 days from 28/11/07 to present.

--- 帖子 #1830 ---
Thanks for your input. Yes, I know there's a difference between live and demo, but still, I like to try new systems on demo, just to see how they work. But you are right, live is the only way to know for sure. I will have your advice in mind.

--- 帖子 #1831 ---
Which are the best pairs to trade using this system?

I have tried many pairs, and found that G/J is good but risky. E/U is also good, but sometimes movements are not that big.

Pipnick, do you suggest E/J and G/U?

--- 帖子 #1832 ---
Hi Archie

I have had success with E\J and G\U however I know other tried have been profitable.

Check out some posts by Mikelath.

Also G/J appeared to profitable for Naranjoe.

--- 帖子 #1833 ---
Hi Guys,

I'm new to this forum and found this thread by chance, I've tried this system only for 3 days and found it very good if not perfect so far, although I made some adjustments as follows:

1. I only trade on 1 pair (Eur-Gbp), as I think the less volatile the pair the better this system will be.

2. Same entry Rule as mikelath, although I only use 1 lot with SL/TP @ 12/15 pips

My Question is for those who has used this system longer then I do, can you tell me the precentage of this system success? (ie: how many loss per let's say 10 trades?)

thanks

--- 帖子 #1834 ---
There are lists in this thread of trade histories and that should give you a rough win percentage, however the system you are using is not the original system whatsoever.  The key to this system was the money management.  You are simply placing a 1 lot trade with a .8 R:R ratio.  The entry for this system was never the key, it was the money management after the entry.

--- 帖子 #1835 ---
I couldn't use the original as it would damage my own risk management per trade, also that I'm currently in a loosing account, so my primary goal is to break even first, then I may follow the original system, beside the pair I trade won't allow that kind of Profit level using this system.

My SL got hit today, maybe it's too small..but I got to stick to this game plan for a while, also I'll increase my TP to 17 pips.

Thanks

Note: My entry point is right at yesterday's low/high...to me entry point is very significant, as i got burnt a lot due to this entry point.

--- 帖子 #1836 ---
Hi! Wich settings do you use for E/J and G/U? E/U seem to work with the regular settings, but G/J doesn't and requires some adjustments.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1837 ---
Hi all,

Would you provide me EA to trade all pairs for this great system?

tks

--- 帖子 #1838 ---
See the attached files in the upper right corner. There is an EA since a while back.

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #1839 ---
Does any one have an idea as to why this EA would just stop working, it had been working for 1 month now, and last night for some reason it just stoped working. i have the smiley face and all is in order (i changed nothing) and it stopped on 2 different brokers and 2 different computers.  Any Ideas?

thanks for the help

mike r

--- 帖子 #1840 ---
Hi,

Hi can't say why it stopped working for you. It is still working for me, but there has been some strange behaviour lately, such as double orders and a few times it has not opened the orders.

I do not know about the double orders, but the times it has missed an opening, can be because my broker did a reset of the demo server, at the same time as the EA would normally open the positions.

Anyone else with the same problems?

--- 帖子 #1841 ---
Thanks archie,

it just started working again, maybe something to do with Sunday, not sure but i will monitor to see if it happens next week

thanks again for the reply

--- 帖子 #1842 ---
Mr PipNick.... can u share the last setting E/J and G/U.... thks....

--- 帖子 #1843 ---
I too have just happened upon this thread and tossed the EA into my E/U demo account I have running.  Profitable trade today.

Also would like settings for other pairs if someone can share?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1844 ---
I use mbt as my broker and I have found a service called hypertrader that will link the 95 pip ea to my mbt trading platform. The process takes place thru an api,but I dont understand how to link the different parts together.Does anyone have any experience with this?

--- 帖子 #1845 ---
The settings highly influence the success of this strategy. I have only tried the E/U and the G/J. The E/U works good with the classic setting of 15/30/50 and SL 30 and BE 15. Perhaps it works better with other settings, but these work ok.

The G/J works best for me if the classic settings are doubled. That means 30/60/100 (or TS on the last order), SL 60, and BE 25 (or perhaps 30). I have seen that others use a BE of 55-60.

Good luck with the trading!

--- 帖子 #1846 ---
for these 2 pairs I use

start time : 8am gmt

look back: 24hrs

tp 1: 15

tp 2: 30

tp 3: 50

s/l: 30

update to b/e at tp 2

good luck

--- 帖子 #1847 ---
Thanks Archie.

No changes in the start time or lookback time?

0:00 and 17 I believe are the defaults?

--- 帖子 #1848 ---
Thanks PipNick,

Just to clarify, update to be = 30 or did I misunderstand that?

--- 帖子 #1849 ---
Hi,

I am using the default settings in the EA

Look back: 17

Start: 22

Expiration: 18

I have not adjusted the time settings, but I think that I will try to do that further on, to observe differences. I'll post the results then.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1850 ---
Thanks alot!

From the EA that has been provided in this thread the default seems to be 0, not 22.  Can you verify this?

I have been running eu with the default of 0, all the rest are the same as what you state however.

Not sure what difference that makes, however I am not sure I understand everything this EA is doing either

--- 帖子 #1851 ---
Yes thats correct update to b/e at 30.

--- 帖子 #1852 ---
Thanks PipNick,

G/J took out all 3 SL on the short a few hours ago for everyone else? (just checkin my settings).

--- 帖子 #1853 ---
Hi Mike,

What's the track record now for the EA. I'm especially interested in the track record of EUR/JPY. I think that one has the best track record, am i right? Where can i find the stats? Thanks, Paris

--- 帖子 #1854 ---
Hi again!

I am using the EA for InterbankFX, and they set their broker time at GMT. Other brokers have other time settings, e.g. FXDD have a broker time of GMT+2 (I think), and then the EA start time would be 0, that's GMT (22) + 2 hours. Perhaps that's the broker you are using?

About your other question, I was closed out too at G/J at all 3 orders on friday. Positive on all 3 orders for E/U though.

Happy trading

--- 帖子 #1855 ---
Yep that looked right to me Taz

--- 帖子 #1856 ---
Thanks guys, I did also win on the eu (although I believe the last leg of that trade is still open, so we'll see what it does at open today   Will continue to monitor both EU and GJ for now, and see how they fair.

--- 帖子 #1857 ---
Hi mikelath, I've set up a statement which updates automatically every 5 minutes here on a new demo account using the EA I found in this thread which I'm still reading. The settings for my EA may be wrong but I'll review them today and along with the common consensus they'll probably change to what is considered best. I'm on FXDD so I downloaded the FXDD EA as a good starting point.

The Daily 95Pips EA for the demo only trades EURUSD, GBPUSD and  USDCAD. There's another on the other currencies you see in the statement. I thought it might be useful for members here for entry confirmation and for my own purposes. Sir, thanks for sharing and have a great day.

--- 帖子 #1858 ---
is is it possible to trade different pairs among the 6 trades per day?

i am new to this system, it appears to be very easy.

What is your recommended pair.i am thinking of pairs with JPY as they are very volatile, one could clear all trades in the positive direction on those pairs.

--- 帖子 #1859 ---
Hi all,

Has anyone using FXCM trading station uses this system got any problem?,

Cause I use FXDD platform for charting, but trade through FXCM.

Today Eur-Gbp did not hit high/low of friday (FXDD), same w/FXCM (although I'm still confused by the server time of FXCM as they also indicate trade in Sunday?).

Point is as friday's high & low was not reached today, how come I got my pending order executed?..as the result..my SL got hit...I'm confused..

Maybe I shouldn't trade on Monday?...to avoid difference between friday and Sunday?

--- 帖子 #1860 ---
pls my previous question was on the initial 95 pips rule or is it obsolete.i am not talking about the EA rule just in case its different.

--- 帖子 #1861 ---
I have now read up to post 800 and the main contributors have answered the same questions dozens of times. It amazes me that many seem to ask questions without taking the time to read what's already written. I guess patience is the companion of wisdom. People that ask questions that have been answered already may have neither. But the main contributors here have both. It wouldn't be fair to mention names because I'm only half way through.

I'll be back with a few questions if I have any when I've read the lot.

--- 帖子 #1862 ---
EURUSD and GBPUSD buy stops traded. USDCAD sell stop traded. Full details updated every 5 minutes here.

Day 1. 75 pips.

Cumulative 75 pips.

--- 帖子 #1863 ---
Have been playing with EUR/USD mainly so far, until I can see how the others perform (gbp/jpy not doing so hot yet)

E/U results for me:

5/14: +15 pips

5/15: +95 pips

5/16: +95 pips

5/19: +15 pips

Keep in mind, this is using the EA with default settings and if you have read this thread it's only one trade group per day.

--- 帖子 #1864 ---
And may the luck continue. Thanks for your analysis endroute. And to Mikelath, Pr1mer, Piphunter196, Yoda_Glenn and mtaboneweb for their massive input here.

As a part of the EA,in the pending orders we get a green bar that appears when we are within 10 pips of the trigger.Is there a way to also add a sound file to that to get an audio alert. I would also like that alert to be sent to my cell phone,is that possible.

hi everyone i have just joined this forum, and have read  some of the the posts, this system sounds good, but i can't find out which is the best EA to use,i am using alpari demo account at the moment,could use some help,i loaded the d95p and the pipnick standard EA's and get a alert this version has expired, is there anything we can do to fix this.

TakeProfit: 15, 30, 50

DeleteOppositeOrder: False

..and GBPJPY as above except:

i live in HOUSTON TEXAS and would like some one to help me with  my settings. if you live in the USA please post your settings . i have read for hrs and i cant find what i need in the forum. please help. thanks  Texan    this is for the EA for interbank

--- 帖子 #1874 ---
Hi Texan,

Here are my settings using the D95.  I live on the west coast, and my settings are based on the Europe and US market hours.  Most of the daily movement takes place between 11 PM & 9 AM Pacific, so I have the EA set to look back 24 hours at 11 PM and close/cancel orders at 2 PM Pacific.  I am currently trading the GBPJPY, EURUSD & USDCHF but that has changed over the past few weeks.  In 10 weeks of trading, I have made ~2500 pips using this system, but that wasn't during the past 10 weeks as I switched brokers earlier this year.  I believe this system is a profitable one long term.

Great to see you back MikeLath!

--- 帖子 #1875 ---
Bioquim,

If you wouldn't mind, could you note all of the settings you are using for these three pairs?  I had been running it on eurusd for awhile but had to remove it for a bit, and now I don't remember what all the settings were!

One post with all of your settings for these pairs would be awesome, especially for new people to the thread who want to test this out.

Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #1876 ---
periodBegin and periodEnd define the "outlined box" inside the box (this is the period in which the indicator adjusts high and low as it changes, it doesn't count the first candle though).

BoxEnd is up to when you want the overall box (outlined part and non-outlined) to be shown on your chart.

All times should be referred to your own platform time and not local time.

--- 帖子 #1877 ---
I'm new to forex so I've been trading a practice account and trying different strategies to see what I like before I go live. I've tried a few scalping systems and haven't quite got the hang of that yet. However, I stumbled upon this thread and just thought I'd post about my results. I've been using this system for 2 days. The first day ended at -90 pips. But the second day I am up 190. Going to set it up again tonight after work with a few pairs. Most likely USD/JPY and EUR/USD. I like the "set and forget" idea behind this one a lot. Anyway, thanks for the thread and sharing your ideas. It helps new people like me a lot.

--- 帖子 #1878 ---
Hi

I have spent the last two days reading through this thread from start to finish ! My sincere appreciation to all who have contributed so considerably.

I have tried attaching the EA to Alpari, and I too have received the "expired" error message.

Presumably though we should be working on a "Spring" EA for the timezones and not the "Autumn" version ? Was the EA set up with a time trigger to prevent this ?

Cav

PS This thread has gone relatively quiet in the past few months. The majority of the original contributors Pr1mer, PipHunter196, Samantha and others are rarely seen. Does this suggest a note of caution, that the gloss has gone from this strategy ?

I haven't noted any change in the overall results to suggest this, other than a few detractors who are convinced that this system will faulter in the longer term.

Is it business as usual on here ?

--- 帖子 #1879 ---
It works.

Hi Mike

Congratulations on what looks a most interesting strategy, and thanks to you and the others for your tenacity on the testing and publication of your results !

I have loaded the EA's successfully, changed the inputs to your settings as above and will now wait and see ... I'm on demo for the moment but based upon the testing that has gone before, once I am happy with the settings etc will go to live.

I just have a couple of questions for you :-

a) I have noted that you have changed the DayStartHour to 0. Should everyone do that, or is that a function for your broker settings ? I am using Alpari (and the relevant EA) that has this default at 23. ie should I keep this or change to 0 ?

b) Are you now trading live ?

Regards

Jeff

I have been using efx/mbt as my broker for several years,I am partial to the ecn format. I have come across hotspot fx who is also an ecn broker.They now offer mt4 as a part of there package.However,they have an additional digit in there quote....example gbp/usd may read 1.95963. I think that additional digit is throwing off the various ea calculations. Has anyone else encountered this problem. when I run the ea it puts my stop loss and t1 about 3 pips away from entry,and I get taken out in seconds.Any help would be appreciated.

I have been running the EA on the EUR/USD live for awhile now, pretty consistant performance.

However, when I do some backtesting with the other pairs, it returns negative results.  Anyone running these live on other pairs and getting good results?  Would love to know your stats and your settings.

--- 帖子 #1891 ---
Tazmaan,

I would be willing to set the EA up on some other pairs and test it.

If I may ask, how many pips are you getting per day/week, on average, from the EUR/USD pair?

Hi, and thanks to all who have contributed so much to the development of this method. I am new to MT4/EA trading. I have opened Demos with IBFX, and FXDD, and have attached to the charts the corresponding EAs as published Jan 31 08. Every thing is going well except I see that the EAs will repeat the lookback/order placemet process every time the MT4 trading platform is reopened after being closed. Example...Open platform at 05:00 GMT, using 06:00 GMT day/start/hour... at 06.00 GMT EA starts and places orders correctly. Now, close platform and reopen. EA will now place a duplicate series of orders, doubling the number of orders standing in the market. Closing/reopening will result in a third series of orders, etc., etc. Am I doing something wrong?

--- 帖子 #1897 ---
So it looks like you guys are trying to develop/optimize something a strategy based on opening range breakout theory.  These are used by professional traders all the time, as they give you a considerable edge, but they almost all experience sharp drawdowns you have to trade through.

The only thing I'm curious about is why do you leave all 6 orders running?  Usually ORB strategies implement orders OCO (One-Cancels-the-Other).  Example, if your long orders got triggered, your shorts would be done for the day, and vice versa.  This removes the chance of the double k.o. when you have big losses in each direction.

Also, I'm joining the thread kind of late, and I noticed that there are 181 attachments.  Which is the latest version and is pipnick still using his?

--- 帖子 #1898 ---
which post can i get the ea from so that i can attach it to my plat form

--- 帖子 #1899 ---
to find the EA:

in the upper right hand corner, next the the list of page number, look for the number 181 followed by a paper clip.  Click on the number and it will bring up all the attachments on this post.  Then, of course, you will have to read the post to figure out which one to use.  By looking at the date on the attachment you can figure out where to start reading.

--- 帖子 #1900 ---
OK - so now I have a question.  I have started forward testing on Alpari with the settings (bigger orders on G/U) on the Alpari Fall Version.  The attachment shows tonights G/U Hour chart with the trades set by the EA.  It looks to me that I could move the sells up to start at 2.0008 or just after and have a better shot at TP'n all three trades.  My question is will this mess with the EA, and conversely, will the EA then mess up the trades?  Will the EA still move the BE or trail if those settings are activated?  If someone knows the answer great, please share.  If not I'll test it, though as I'm typing this G/U just broke 2.0008 so I'll have to try it next time.

Thanks to all who have written and worked on this!

--- 帖子 #1901 ---
Hi Mike

As the tittle says, i have a question that is driving me mad... Why we enter a buy position with HIGH + 5 instead LOW -5? If we enter a BUY we expect a rising rate so, if we enter at HIGH levels rate will be much difficult to achieve profits.

Otherwise maybe i didn't get the point.

Hey all,

I haven't been vocal here in a while but I wanted to share the EA that I've been working on. Anyone who would like to test/try it is more than welcome to do so.  It's called "DailyHighLow_AutoTrader" and can be found here...

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=96862

I know there will be questions so please ask them on that thread.  I feel it will do most of what people here have been doing and maybe even more.  It's been a while since I've read the posts here and I'm kind of behind.

I am confused about the Friday trades. It has been said that we trade 10pm GMT which is 5pm Central Time ( where i live). But markets are closed on Friday at this time...

What am i missing here??

--- 帖子 #1904 ---
I started trading this EA on a demo account a few weeks ago. Overall, the results have been mixed. I have now stopped testing the EA for the following reasons :-

a) There appear to be some bugs in the EA eg double trades, move to BE not working all the time, cancel opposite orders not always working.

b) The results showed considerable volatility even in a short space of time. This would suggest profit being heavily reliant upon time in the cycle and hence risky ie potential for large drawdown.

c) The original key developer and contributors to this EA don't seem around anymore. This raises a red flag.

That said ... I spent a good deal of time reading through the entire thread, testing etc. However, this is clearly only a fraction of the time spent on this by the originators of the theory, EA developers and early testers. If indeed the EA has proven unviable, this is a huge shame.

Sincere thanks and respect to all involved. If I am right that this EA has not fulfilled everyone's expectations, I hope this will not deter others from working on new strategies. On the contrary, the lesson we can all take from this is how long it takes to prove a winning strategy, the amount of work involved and the caution required prior to trading live.

Cav

--- 帖子 #1905 ---
CAV,

Agreed with all said but this is the way alot of threads end up and die. This was another death by EA, lack of success or indifference.  This EA either was great or totally stunk all within the same day. Not consistent. Maybe this post will spur those to come out of the woodwork and tout how great the EA and method is, would be, could be or should have been....who knows...another one bites the dust.....there is always an opportunity for someone to post and ask where the latest EA is..... so I  guess in reality the thread is allowed to never really die.

are you trading manually or with an EA?????????

I've been trading it "old school" per post #1 on USDJPY only, manually with no EA.  Performance has been OK.

Post #1 only mentions USDJPY as the main pair to trade this; the other pairs mentioned were going to be studied further.

Have not been trading this method very much, but when I do I look back 24 hrs from London open and trade a break of H or L of 6 pips on E/U with SL 25, B/E at 20, TP1 20, TP2 30, and TP3 55. I pull unfilled orders after 18 hrs. Also trade GBP/JPY with naranjoe's settings. Have had modest results with both pairs. This is not trading advice. Just the way I have traded this. I am uneasy using EAs to trade, and it is impractical for me to trade this manually.

--- 帖子 #1918 ---
Hello,

maybe someone else already asked it, but would it be possible to modify the EA to open different lots for the three targets? I mean, for example: 1 lot for 1st target, 0.7 for 2nd, 0.5 for 3rd..

Thanks a lot.

Hi tomomi72003, I had been recommended a larger SL for this method by a very good trader many weeks ago. However, I failed to listen,"and did it my way." It looks now to me that a SL of 45-60 pips on Eur/Usd may produce better results. Testing with IBFX strategy tester from 3/09/08 to 8/08/08 produced good results in my opinion. My settings were : Margin...6. SL...45. Break even...20. TP 1...20. TP 2...30. TP 3...55. Day/Start/Hour...1 hour before London open. After time change in London, this is 06:00 GMT, then reverts to 07:00 when time is changed back. Look Back Hours...24. Order Expiration Hours...9. I have orders expiring one hour before London close. Of course this is not trading advice. It is just how I have tested the method. Of course it must be remembered that MT4 strategy testers have been called second rate, and also that one should not place a great deal of faith in their output, because they are not tick by tick data. I am not too sure about this. Anyway, good luck in your trading.

Hi, I'm reading all this thread and I'm working to produce an EA that works on daily bars, instead of 1H time frame.

In this way I can avoid to think about what is the better open hour.

Daily candles are the same all over the world, isn't it?

In my opinion, working on daily candles take the work easier.

Another point: I'm trying to define take profit levels in this way.

Take profit 1: High[1] + 15% previous day ATR(4)

Take profit 2: High[1] + 30% previous day ATR(4)

Take profit 3: High[1] + 45% previous day ATR(4)

In recent months I read some breakout systems studies and I saw that the ATR(4) instead of ATR(14) or ATR(21) works very well on a small time horizon.

I will post here if I obtain interesting results.

--- 帖子 #1925 ---
The more i read this thread the more i get confused about the time. So 5pm est is 4 pm ctd. That's 21.00 GMT on IBFX right? If yes thats not 2 hours before the ASsian market opens...What am i missinG?

Hi

I am just wondering which is the latest EA for this strategy? Not sure I have the latest one. I am using it as the basis for an EA version of the New York Box breakout strategy.

ALso, OCO has been mentioned in relation to this strategy. I cannot find this in the EA. Is it present, or does it still need adding?

Many thanks

David

--- 帖子 #1928 ---
I've read through the entire thread. There was so much hard work put in here. I was so excited, but things seem to have quieted down. Has anyone gone on to make consitent profits with a live account? Thank you, Alexandra

--- 帖子 #1929 ---
I wonder if Mike and others are still forwardtesting EA...

Have read almost all posts, but, maybe overread something in second half.

Did you guys lost interest in this thing or it didn't make profit ?

--- 帖子 #1930 ---
Hello pipping,

I prefer used simple trading system, I used moving average

--- 帖子 #1931 ---
BTW, be careful as latest version (and all other before) i have found here has a bug, one part of program code is badly written and it opens all orders normal but x 3 (same order three times) on the begining of week.

Anyone noticed this ?

(will soon post EA as it should be)

--- 帖子 #1932 ---
i've tasted this system many times, its always make you lose pips what means money,

there is an idea cames to my head that night when i was thinking of this system, its a gamblers way of getting rich, and i think you can apply it here and profit too..

use a little % of your whole capetal, just like %1, and X2 it when you lose.

Exampel-

in $10,000 account..

first day you lost 100 pips what means $100  thats %1 of your account.

2nd day you enter with $200 what means %2 of ur account, if you win 100 pips then you have made %1 profit in 2 days, if you lost the %2 again in the 2nd day.

then the 3rd day come, you enter with %4 of your account, if you win 100 pips then you have made %1 profit in 3 days, if you lost the %4 then enter with %8 in the 4th day

its kinda easy money management strategy, and it can low the risk..

there is another thing important, that your first entary is what you will get after the end of the lossing wave, exampel, when u first enter with $1000, and got 10 losses in row in 10 days, and won in the 11 day, that means you have made $1000 in 11 days, if you entered with $10, and again got into 10 lossing trades in row, and won in the 11 day that means you have made just $10 in 11 days. so its matter how much money you have in ur account since you just ganna use %1 or %2 of ur whole capetal.

another thing, you need to TP the same amount of pips if u wanna use this money management strategy.

thanks for reading, for more information feel free to PM me

Faris.

--- 帖子 #1933 ---
The system you are referring to is called Martingale system and it's nothing new.

You forgot to mention one tiny rhing, but it's a huge thing.

If you had 10000$, and first day you started with 10% (100$), let's look what would happen if you would double every day (if we have a loosing streak)

1 day -  100$  (100$ total invested)

2 day -  200$  (300$ total)

3 day -  400$  (700$)

4 day -  800$  (1500$)

5 day - 1600$ (3100$)

6 day - 3200$ (6300$)

7 day - 6400$ (12700$)

So, as you see, you would not last for more than 6 days with this system.

8 day - 12800$ (25500$)

9 day - 25600$ (51100$)

10 day - 51200$ (102300$)

As you also see, for 10 days you wouldn't survive even if you started with 1% (10$) !

--- 帖子 #1934 ---
anyone still trading this?

--- 帖子 #1935 ---
Yes I'm still trading this or a slight variation.  I'm just using a single order on GBP/JPY.

Start time 7am BST

Lookback 24hrs

Target 110

Stop 60

I've backtested it over 5 years on tradestation using 5 minute data and it will make about 40 pips per week.

Its fairly robust for this pair as other parameters work well.  Other pairs are also profitable but to a lesser extent.

If you can handle the drawdowns higher profit targets are more profitable, but I'm happy with a conservative setting for now.

There are loads of breakout varations on the forum some better than others. Most of them will probably be profitable I guess.

Cheers

Pipnick

--- 帖子 #1936 ---
wow thats awesome pipnick ! if possible could you publish the results of your backtest for or if you prefer not to could you at least tell us :-

how much was lost in the worst month?

how many months were losing months over the 5 year test period?

what was the max number of losers you had in a row?

thanks

just wondering what brokers you guys are using to trade thio method now that the NFA regulation is in effect?  I'm with IBFX and I can't place opposing pending orders and am therefore hunting around for another MT4 broker allowing hedging and which offers mini accounts

--- 帖子 #1939 ---
Hi Trumpcard,

I have a question. I heard about the new hedging regulations but I thought it just applied to having two open trades (a short and long) on the same pair in the same account? Does it also deal with pending trades that are not even open yet? Like if I have a short trade open and my pending long will not open until the short closes. Is this not allowed by brokers now? Thanks for your response.

I wanted to add that the broker I use (Forex.com) will be allowing hedging at their UK division. You might want to check with them. I have been very happy with them so far and they offer mini and micro accounts. And also MT4.

--- 帖子 #1940 ---
thank you very much Nick ! much obliged ....... the results appear to be quite encouraging especially since its over a 5 year period.

I was just wanting to ask you whether you were able to consider the spread in the back test, especially in the case of gj as its normally quite large.

thanks again

--- 帖子 #1941 ---
The back test does not consider spread but I don't see the spread impact being significant.

The way I view spread is as follows:-

The spread on my spread betting account is 8 pips for gbp/jpy so there are 4 pips either side of the 'target' buy/sell price.

So basically my orders are placed 4 pips early and closed 4 pips late. The spread would only be important when:-

1. My order is filled and price then reverses to stop me out without reaching the target order price (which is 4 pips away)

2. A filled order hits the profit target price but then reverses to be stopped out without hitting the bid/offer price for the progit to be filled (which is 4 pips away)

On these 2 occaisons losses would have occured in real trading but not in the back test.

These will be offset by the opposite happeneing with the stop loss price.

The occaisons above will have happened during the test but they will not be very often.  For all other trades the backtest would be as per real trading.

I hope I've made this easy to understand, I beleive I am right although stand to be corrected.

Cheers

Nick

--- 帖子 #1942 ---
Hi fugly

following your PM please attached optimization report, this shows results for all profit targets from 30 pips (300 on report) to 500 pips (5000 on report) in 10 pip increments

easier to see if you put it in a spreadsheet.

60 target is proftable, however if you can handle a little bit more pain, the rewards were significantly better with targets of 90 pips +.  The next significant increase is around the 350 pip mark, however I don't think I could handle the 18 consecutive losses that this presented!!!!!!

Good luck

--- 帖子 #1943 ---
Just curious, but why did you stop using three target levels??

--- 帖子 #1944 ---
thank you very much Nick you've been great !!

--- 帖子 #1945 ---
I would like the sound of 300 pips a day that would be amazing!

--- 帖子 #1946 ---
number of pips per day doesn't say anything about the profitability of the system. You have to consider the reward:risk ratio and max number of losers in a row along with the % of winners to correctly size your position and determine profitability.

But if its pips a day you're after check out Sally's Daily quarter method

--- 帖子 #1947 ---
Is anyone still successfully using the "Daily 95 Pips" experts? I'm unable to get them to enter trades.  I've tested the IBFX version on an IBFX four digit data demo account, and tried other versions on an FXPro demo account that uses 5 digit data.  None will enter trades and there are no error messages?

I've been manually trading with success, similar take profit targets, but using the London open with the Asian session as the lookback period for hi-lo.

Any suggestions for a fix on the experts?

Thanks.

LeoM

--- 帖子 #1948 ---
I have an IBFX live and demo accounts and haven't had trouble manually placing pending buy-sell trades.  Once one is in effect however the "Trade is Disabled" message pops up if I try to enter a hedged trade.

I have had trouble getting the Daily 95 Pips experts to setup and enter trades, however. I've wondered if the hedging rule is the reason.  That would explain the IBFX acounts in the US not working but I tested the expert on a European based FXPro (5-digit) demo and it wouldn't enter pending or new trades???

Hello Pipnick,

I guess someone else has also raised this question but I was not able to find an answer.. If anyone can answer this..

How can 2 orders, 1 for buyStop and another for SellStop, be placed on for the same pair for the same account?

Is it still possible after hedging restrictions..

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1952 ---
You can place two limit orders at the same time. But you can't have 2 open trades if one is long and the other short... they would cancel each other out. So using this system you need to be aware if your buy and sells overlap. It could happen if the previous days trading had a high/low range of only say 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #1953 ---
Pipnick,

thanks for all your work in backtesting the GBPJPY... have you noticed if there were certain time periods when losses were disproportionally high? I'm guessing that this system works very well in a trending market, but less effectively in a ranging(horizontal) market. any comments?

--- 帖子 #1954 ---
Not on US based accounts, you can still hedge on UK on other currency accounts - check with your broker as many are offering an option to hold 2 accounts, then trade one long and one short, it balances out in the end.

--- 帖子 #1955 ---
borborygmi,

This is an interesting question.  I haven't noticed anything realated to time or trending / ranging markets.  Given the volatility of the pair and the 110 pip price target, i'm not sure this would be significant, however I haven't looked too closely.

However, I have noticed that since December, buy orders have been far more profitable than sell orders.  Since the end of January we have been in an uptrend (daily chart) therefore there could be somthing in this.  More analysis required at some point!!!!

--- 帖子 #1956 ---
I have read of lot of the threads and would like to try this EA, but can not find the EA itself.

--- 帖子 #1957 ---
Can someone explain to me just how having a Buy standing order and a Sell standing order in the same currency, the triggering of one cancelling the other, is a Hedge trade. Will close all of my US Fx accounts because of this nonsense.

--- 帖子 #1958 ---
Even in US accounts, one can have pending (limit) orders in opposite direction on same instrument (currency pair). Example : Oanda

Its having open orders in opposite directions where hedging reg kicks in

Could anyone help, I have triede to add zeros in the code but the ea still uses 4 digits  making take profit and stop loss to be tenths that is instead of 40 pips stop loss I get 4 pips stop loss.

I dont know if Mikelath is still here, but i would like to thank him for starting this thread and sharing his ideas, which formed the base of my trading system.

I tried trading this system for a few months, and results were a little better then BE. Later I found that the failed trades were bounded by past supports and resistances... So i set my take profits at the next S or R. It's just the basic idea, but i hope it helps.

I have read through this whole thread but could not see an answer as to why Mike chose to use last 17 hours and what was the logic behind this? I find it an odd number but he must have got this from somewhere or based this on something...... I would have thought 24 hours is the best

Any thoughts

--- 帖子 #1974 ---
Hi Shrips,

I cannot tell you why 17 hours particularly and I don't believe that it is particularly relevent. The whole breakout concept is to do with the Asian range.

Various people have written about price behavior in relation to it, Boris Schlossberg for one.

Phil Newton has another view and has his 'set of hours' from which he trades the breakout.

I have been looking at a half hour range just prior to Europe opening.

The real problem is the false breaks by an odd pip or two from any line selected. Add a ten pip buffer and you will see price go twelve pips, come back and hit your stop loss.

There are also commercial packages available 'London Rush' and another later version with a similar name.

Unfortunately none of these breakout systems just work!!

95 looked a good answer but until we find a way of dealing with the 'pop up and stops' it is not a long term winner.

--- 帖子 #1975 ---
I do like this system because of its high probability to reach TP(especially the first 2 TP) when the market is behaving in a strong trending  manner.

The key to trading this system long term is the ability to know when not to trade this. If you trade this 365 days of the year, I dont think you will show a profit.

Trade this in a week like we are having now and you will kill your account.

Just curious if anyone is trading this live and consistently showing good results?

--- 帖子 #1976 ---
Regarding the entries of placing a buy or sell 5 pips below and above the high & lows of previous day. Would that mean putting a buy order 5 pips above the previous days high or 5 pips below the previous days low, could please clarify a little about that?  Thanks

--- 帖子 #1977 ---
I just wondering if anyone has any test results of this system in excel for any period.

Im looking for High/Low and close data as well as win/loss results. Im looking to add a few more filters to this system to improve it.

It would be a great help

--- 帖子 #1978 ---
Well if I read the entry post correctly,  he' putting his orders at 5 p.m. EST.  In continental Europe we also call this time of the day 17:00,  and that's your answer - he's looking back until midnight EST.

I could speculate that the orders are put and the range determined when the main Europe and U.S. sessions are closed and only the asian session remains open or starts.  Maybe the idea is that during asian trading things behave more ,,regular'',  especially when USD-GBP or EUR-USD are concerned?

[quote=mikelath;1559420]Hi all and welcome to the DAILY95PIPS strategy.

Before we start I urge you to paper trade any new strategy including this one before committing any of your own funds. Thorough testing is crucial before taking any strategy live.

Also bear in mind that this system is by no means new and may look familiar to some of you. I am simply passing it on from my predecessors/mentors in the hope that it adds to your existing trading arsenal and increases your trading results.

The basis of this system is VERY simple and has proven to be profitable,...[/quHi all it is very good ,but i need totally reverse,sellstops become buystops and buy stop,become sellstop,

--- 帖子 #1985 ---
hi all

i am trade manually just opposite to this EA it gives good results, so kindly modify for reverse trades, means,, sellstops orders become Buystop AND BUYSTOPS become sellstops

--- 帖子 #1986 ---
So what you are trying to say is:

Long orders:

1. Entry = Low-5pips, TP=15pips, SL=30pips

2. Entry = Low-5pips, TP=30pips, SL=30pips

3. Entry = Low-5pips, TP=50pips, SL=30pips

Short orders:

1. Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=15pips, SL=30pips

2. Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=30pips, SL=30pips

3. Entry = HIGH+5pips, Take Profit=50pips, SL=30pips

How are the results on this strategy?

Thanks

Hi,  This sounds a bit  like what Carl Dittman is advocating but is selling this strategy for $54!!.  I e-mailed him with what was on this and he confirmed it was pretty much same!  Here on Forex Factory it is a lot cheaper.

Anyway I have a question.  When you say look at the high and the low of the previous 17 hours do you also include the pin bits of the candle or is it just the body you take account of.  This would make a difference because the pins (or shadows whatever you call them) are sometimes quite long.  Also why do you have to set these at a specific time, can you not do this strategy at any time of the day, again looking at the previous 17 hours.  I did see another site that advocated that you take the high or low of the previous day on the daily chart and then set and forget as per your instructions, ie you do  not look at the high and low of the previous 17 hours only just 12 hours or less.  I am really interested in this strategy and am trying to test it on a demo account but I need to get my head around the details.  Would say making these orders at 7.00 am GMT be ok, using the high and the low of the previous day which closes at 0.00.

--- 帖子 #1991 ---
You have to consider every pin. All candles are formed by battles between bulls and bears and pins are part of that, only they were rejected by the other guys.

It'd be interesting to have more info about some one who traded this, but I personally would do something else, althought I must admit that auto systems are really seductive once you have them up and running.

--- 帖子 #1992 ---
your ea is ok for me.can you please tell me which setting setting i need to change.MY way is calculate asian session hi - lo then entry.

i see that you set previous 17 hour hi lo.if i need to change it like that it only calculate specific time hi-lo.what i need to change?

extern int DayStartHour = 22; // 5pm EST On Your Brokers Server

extern int LookBackHours = 17;

extern int OrderExpirationHours = 18;

extern bool CloseOrdersNextDay = true;

in my mt4 asian session closed at 12.00 pm

i need to change it to extern int DayStartHour = 12.00 pm

in my mt4 asian session time 00.00 am to 11.59 pm

extern int LookBackHours = 12;

what will be the order expiration date cause i close all trade 11.59 pm

I have tried and test this method with just one position, but result is not good. Not sure if 3 buystop and sellstop would work. Maybe someone may clarify this system, is trade management issue or system probability issue?

Dear at first sorry for my bad English...

I am A small Money Trader. So i can't take 3 order at a time because of money management.

So i make some changes.. Some one please make an EA for this settings....

Details:

Buy Stop: previous Day candle High + 5 PIP

Sell Stop: previous Day candle low - 5 PIP

SL & TP 30 PIP.

SL & TP Will be modify manually on settings

If previous Day Candle close green then only open Buystop and If previous Day Candle close red then only open Sellstop
