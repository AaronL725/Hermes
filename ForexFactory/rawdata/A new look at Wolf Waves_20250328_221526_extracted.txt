This is a summary by Bill Wolfe from a contributor later in this thread. Attached File(s) Wolfe-Wave-book (1).pdf 7.8 MB | 9,324 downloads | Uploaded Apr 25, 2016 9:59am First of all, I must say that this is not my primary trading system, but I have recently started using Wolf Waves with some success. There was only a couple of other threads on this topic on FF and they quickly died. I'll start with my understanding of the concept, and expand from there. I would appreciate any active users of this system (classical or modified) to chip in. The classical system as I understand it is illustrated by the H4 CAD/JPY chart below from last week. Attached Image (click to enlarge) We are looking at a wedge shaped pattern with a count of tops/bottoms or waves. If it is a falling wedge, then #1 is at the bottom. If it is a rising wedge #1 is at the top. The count goes to 5 which should penetrate line 1 to 3. When 5 is reached, a pending order is placed on the other side of line 1 to 3, with a stop below point 5. A line is drawn from point 1 through point 4. This is the profit target line. Entry and profit target are illustrated by the green and pink arrows. This trade had a 69 pip SL and a 325 pip profit target which was reached. I like this system because of the clearly defined entry, stop and profit target. I will go into the variations on my next post. I just noticed that I misspelled Wolfe. I omitted the 'e' on the title and the first several posts. Edit: Here is a link that is good: http://www.forexmt4.com/_MT4_Tutoria...fe%20Waves.pdf Another link with a lot of charts: http://www.chart.nu/wolfewave.htm :

As mentioned in the previous post, there seems to be a few variations on Wolf Waves. Some say that a parallel channel or even a megaphone pattern will work the same way. I give you an example of 2 almost parallel channels again from last week, both of which hit their profit targets. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see, the second example on this chart, point 5 only barely penetrated line 1 to 3. Some say that this is not important if there are other confirming factors such as an oversold oscillator, candle pattern, or even price below/above the Bollinger Band. In this case, we have all three.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
OK, here are two current examples of WW. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I don't like initiating trades at the end of the weekend, because of gaps, spread widening and unreliability, but here they are. The first is a parallel channel and the second is a wedge. You can use Wolf Waves on any time frame even though I have shown only H4 examples.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I just noticed that I probably broke the rules on the AUD/JPY current illustration above. The channel is sloping slightly down and maybe the count should have started low not high. It raises an interesting point. If you accept that an equal sided channel is valid, and it is horizontal, where should the count start? I know that criticism will be leveled that the system is too discretionary, but all systems need discretion. The nice thing about WW is that the trade is opened with a pending order with plenty of advance warning, and if price does not come back across line 1-3, the order is not triggered. Also, stops are fairly tight compared to the profit target, giving a good RR.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Another current and past example on EUR/CAD H1 chart. On the current example, you will notice that price actually gapped a bit lower (16 pips) because of the weekend before moving up.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Nice profitkeeper! But be ready for some challenges from those with differing definitions of what makes up a Wolf Wave. Some would say the nearly parallel "wedges" aren't wedges so aren't Wolf Waves. But if the parallel channel "wedges" with the 5 points make you money that's all that matters.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks Poocher, I would accept that criticism. I did find examples of parallel wave counts on the net, so I included them. I draw the line at megaphone formations which I also found, but maybe they work too. I had to laugh at the comment on Tom Bulkowski's web site when he was evaluating Wolf Waves. He contacted Bill Wolf to ascertain the complete rules for the pattern. Wolf's only reply was to buy his $3,000 course.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Your EURCAD, USDCHF and AUDJPY examples are not valid Wolfe Waves as points 3 and 4 have to be on opposite sides (above and below) of point 1. Also I have found that all these tops and bottoms lie on some fibonacci level. Particularly important are 1.13, 1.272 and 1.618

--- 帖子 #9 ---
There was a good one on USDCAD H1 earlier last week. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thanks for contributing. You may well be right, although I have not seen this rule before. I will try and restrict my examples to this in the future. Your comment on fib levels is interesting. From which points are you pulling the fib?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
OK, Here's one from last week that complies with GNWFx's rule Attached Image (click to enlarge) An update on the other current trades: USD/CHF - not triggered - invalid AUD/JPY - in progress so far 68 or 121 pips depending on whether you entered on the line cross or candle close EUR/CAD -Only made it to the other side of the channel (which may be a good first profit target) for 54pips

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I thought I had included this one from Sunday trigger. It's an H1 chart that hit it's target for 119 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Per the rules, point 4 is the highest high or lowest low between points 3 and 5. Thus the target line drawn on your EURUSD chart is incorrect. Actually it is a failed Wolfe Wave as the target was never reached. Attached Image Though right after this one, there was another Wolfe Wave which did make the target. Attached Image Also about the Fibonacci ratios, tops and bottoms on valid Wolfe Waves usually lie on some fib level. Attached Image Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi GN, Perhaps you could give us a complete set of rules (save misunderstanding on my part). Either that or I could rename the thread Coyote Waves with hardly any rules. One rule I did find was that there should be a regular time between all waves which would invalidate your example H1 example. If you use a line chart (closing price). my H1 chart was valid. No wonder previous threads on Wolfe Waves died.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi profitkeeper, Please don't feel offended on things I pointed out which I felt were errors. The rules can be found here and at several other sites. I am sure you must have studied them thoroughly. Wolfe Waves are powerful setups. Keep up your good work.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
No offence taken GN. I'm glad to have your input. The frustration is on my part - trying to nail down the exact parameters of the pattern. I had gone over Bill Wolfe's webpage and still couldn't see the specific "rules" you mentioned. Other sites I have come across had bits and pieces which often contradicted each other. One of my aims in starting this thread was to get input from anyone who may have taken the course, or at least used the waves on a regular basis. I can see the potential and hope to continue using the concept in one area of my trading.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Wolfe Waves are not part of my regular repertoire of analytical tools. A few years ago I had done extensive work on them and had loads of saved charts. This one, for instance, on EURUSD weekly chart took about a year from start to finish. Attached Image Now that you have revived my interest in this pattern, I will be looking at more examples of currently developing Wolfe Waves and let's share our experiences with them.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Weekly!! That must have generated a lot of pips. On the other end of the spectrum, I was playing around with 5 minute charts and found this little pattern (it probably breaks a rule or two), but pips were there for the taking Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Correction. Point 3 and 5 are higher highs or lower lows after point1. In your GBPJPY chart point 3 is slightly lower than point 1. This one is probably a failed breakout of a flag pattern, which is pretty rare as flags are continuation patterns.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
But a flag pattern doesn't break back down from point 5 like my Coyote pattern does. Seriously, I knew it didn't quite comply, but I loved the way it hit the profit target to the pip. It's after 1:00am here and I'll say good night

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi profitkeeper, Hahaha. I love the name you have given to these offbeat Wolfe Waves. Great work if you picked those 50 odd pips on GBPJPY.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Here's another one on a 15 minute chart from last night. I didn't trade this one as it triggered in the middle of the night (my time). Perhaps Gn could tell us if it's within the rules. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Great work profitkeeper. Pass!! Very Well Done.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Since Wolfe Waves were originally designed for indexes (specifically the S&amp;P) I thought I would throw in one for the DOW triggered on Feb 11 if it qualifies as a WW Attached Image (click to enlarge) That was a move of 818 points. Think what you could have made on cheap call options when the predictions were for more downside.

Been busy trading and working on another strategy. I was hoping to get a bit more participation in this thread, but I guess the interest is not there. Maybe Bill Wolfe intimidates students to his course. He states on the web site that students are required to sign a non disclosure agreement - a bit paranoid in my opinion - but there you are. Anyway, I was testing various Wolfe Wave indicators available for free and costing upwards of $300.00. They all seem to work the same way (either zigzag or fractal based), and I suppose it would be difficult to program any other way. The limitations of course are in the zigzag or fractal settings. In general, they don't work very well, and they put on lines and numbers before point 4 or 5 are determined which clutters the chart with patterns that invariably do not complete, and they miss a lot of patterns. Below is one pattern the free indicator on "Market" did find. This is current - I don't know whether it will trigger and complete or not. I will attach another free one which is the same.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I put a pending order on the above potential trigger to show where I place the TP, SL, etc. As you can see, I put TP1 on the other side of the channel (wedge) and the second at the true profit target. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Well that was easy! The trade triggered when I was sleeping and completed after I got up this morning. It came just short of the final target, and I closed it out for a 65 pip profit when it started retracing. The run was actually 73 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Profitkeeper, I just now saw your thread, and I want to say thanks! I could never get my head around Wolfe Waves; you've gone a long ways to help me see the light, lol. Hopefully I can develop a taste for these things. Cheers, JohnnyR

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Welcome JohnnyR I am constantly amazed at how they work (even my off beat Coyote waves). They tend to be counter intuitive, i.e often going against the trend like my trade last night. I still don't know all the nuances, or if they are important. After a while you can see them easily particularly in a semi consolidating market. Here is another one that triggered this morning. I'm not sure whether it is legit, but I like to look for patterns where point 5 drops below line 1-3. This one is extreme but still worked. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I didn't trade this one - I wish I had. I think I'll have to start using trend line alerts.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Obviously, on this last example, I wouldn't have put profit one target on line 2-4, but rather half way to the final profit target.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Another one (that I missed) that triggered yesterday afternoon and hit it's target today for 90 pips or so. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks Profitkeeper This looks great! Keep it coming! Suscribed... On the CADJPY 30M chart, for how long would you consider that 1 - 3 line as still valid. Considering that in the example price went way beyond 1-3 line and for several candles before coming back to the line. Would you consider the pattern as invalid after X amount of time or pips from 1-3 line? Regards..

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Welcome Masilva, I see you are in Mexico, must be close to the same time zone. I'm in PST on the west coast of Canada. If you catch any Wolfe Waves that I miss, please post if they are approaching or hit point 5. If you are not sure, post anyway (that goes for everyone). I'm not an authority, but maybe GnWFx would set us on the straight and narrow. I have decided to make this my main longer term strategy. I also daytrade a different strategy.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I was thinking about this - it's why I called it extreme. I haven't come across any rule about this, and one web site even said that "you never know when price will return to line 1-3". This is where discretion comes in. I probably wouldn't let it go much beyond that example, and probably would ignore it if price went much further. On a higher time frame it may not look so extreme.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Well, what about this one? Is it a valid pattern? should we wait for price to go past 1-3 line or we should be in already? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
It looks valid to me. It would be nice if point 5 penetrated line 1-3 in order to give you a chance to enter when price comes down across 1-3 and then give a tight stop loss. I guess we'll see.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Sorry, I didn't answer the second part of your question. Yes, you should have been in already. It's looking good so far - +30 pips or so since you posted. I would probably have taken profit 1 or maybe moved to break even (if that is your style) by now.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Yes. I did enter with a very little position just to test drive the strategy. Currently SL at BE+1. TP all the way down to the 1-4 line. Let's see .. Best regards. PS. Currently 22:35 hrs local time Edit: SL hit before going to TP. Hehe.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
It was a good trade though and would have been perfect with a little earlier (higher) entry or no BE. Nice to see it went to TP.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I wanted to discuss rules, discretion, subjectivity etc. What do you do when you are not sure whether a pattern qualifies as a technical Wolfe Wave? I am not a great one for adhering strictly to the rules (if you know what they are). Someone discovered the pattern and made his own rules. What made him (her) the unfailing guru. The important thing in my opinion is the principles of the pattern. Below you will find a probably technically incorrect Wolfe Wave, but if you switch to a line chart (closes) and adjust the lines accordingly the ambiguity is gone and the point count is obvious. It still may not comply with every rule, but it works. By the way, I often switch to line charts to better see patterns and trend lines. Here is a chart from this morning to illustrate the point: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi I just get in to this one.. Regards Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
The structure looks good, but I'm a little concerned about the massive bull candle coming into the pattern. Chris Lori (another guru) maintains that this is considered a gap in forex and the gap will be filled. We'll see who is right. I vote for the pattern.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hello ! There is plenty of waves, I have a question what is the procedure, what is the rules to build a pattern ?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks for sharing..good stuff. I found this PDF online. Wolfe wave at niftypundit.com

--- 帖子 #48 ---
There is no link. I couldn't find the pdf on the web site Welcome, always glad to have participants.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Well, you've found a pretty well perfect Wolfe Wave. I'll review the pattern (as I see it). I'll do my best since I have yet to find a complete set of parameters. I did give a brief synopsis in post 1. A Wolf Wave in general is a wedge shaped pattern (up or down). The more distinct and obvious the pattern, the better it is. It seems to be a very reliable trading pattern. If the wedge is down sloping, you start the point count low and if it is up sloping start the count high for #1. It is easier if point 5 crosses line 1-3, then a buy (sell) order can be placed where price will cross back across line 1-3. Point 5 can move a fair distance past line 1-3 before returning. It has just poked through in this example. The stop loss is placed below the low of point 5. The line through (magenta dashed) 1-4 is the profit target line. I divide the profit in two, taking the first half at half the distance to TP2. Money management is entirely up to you of course, but that's the way I do it now. If there is a more specific question, I will try and answer it. Below is your chart with references. The total pip run was 113 which is not bad on an M15 chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) There are other rules which I apparently break and a couple can be found in earlier posts. I have broken these rules several times and still found it profitable, for instance I have found that a parallel channel also works and even a horizontal channel or wedge, but then there is a dilemma as to where you start the count which is important.

Hey Masilva, Do you want to comment on your trade or can I?

Hello ProfitKeeper, Thanks for your thread. I just follow from last one week and some of the success trade as attached.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
For those wanting more info on Wolfe Waves, Bulkowski's article and test results are interesting even though it is related to stocks only. He suggests drawing a line parallel to line 2-4 from point 3 to get a trading zone between this and point 5, although I prefer to wait until price crosses back across line 1-3. There are other rules listed there as well. http://thepatternsite.com/WolfeWaveBull.html

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Welcome umpats, Many thanks for posting. It looks like great work, although it was hard to make out the waves (trades) on the two on the left side. I never thought of trying the 5 min time frame. I thought it wouldn't be as reliable.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hello Profitkeeper. I have never come across Wolf Waves before but I have only been in the trading game for about a year. Anyway I just came across your thread and I have to say that that it looks great so far and very interesting. I can now see these setups all over my charts (hind sight is a wonderful thing I know). I will be following now and will try to post timely set ups where I can but I have a full time job so I can't promise to be the most active member. Please keep it coming!

that's perfect.. Mr. Wolfe says to have bigger volume at 5 brake out.less vol back into the 5. Good pips

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I agree. It looks good But this is where my bias shows through. I am Canadian and would not like to see this happen to our dollar after it has struggled to get this far. My forex accounts are even in Cdn dollars. We even sent our new Prime Minister to suck up to Obama. For this to reach it's profit target, it would mean a 300+ pip move. LOL

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Not good for you then if this one comes off......but here is another perspective looking at the daily chart. I think we could see a pullback. 300pips would do me! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I don't know whether this is the PDF that HighFivve was referring to, but it is a good outline of Wolfe Waves: http://www.forexmt4.com/_MT4_Tutoria...fe%20Waves.pdf By the way, be careful downloading other "manuals" etc. I tried to download one and ended up with several viruses and unwanted programs that took me a day to clear. Edit: I just noticed that one of the waves in the PDF is a "reverse wedge" i.e. megaphone pattern, and she is a friend of Bill Wolfe - so I guess that is acceptable too.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Profitkeeper, be my guest. No problem if you want to comment on it. Unfortunately for me on that trade price went exactly to my SL to the pip, and immediately after it started to go up the my TP. We may want to discuss how many pips from the low/high should be a good place to set the SL. Best regards. I'm ready for the next one we could find. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I feel for you. I suspected that may have happened. If I was in that trade, I would have put my stop in the same place. The only thing I might suggest is that you could have done one of the most difficult things (for me) in trading. You could have re-entered the trade after you got stopped out. It would mean that you had confidence in the outcome, and a confirmation that it was going to follow through. (Sorry if I shook your confidence). I know many traders here scorn indicators, but I always have an 8,3,3 Stochastics on my charts, just for confirmation. If you check it out, you will see that there was a divergence on the second dip low. The blue bumpy line over laid is the one hour 8,3,3, which also diverged and both started to head up.

Thanks for the link! I found this WW (or CW?) after reading Linda's pdf: Although it fits her rules, I think it would be hard to spot in realtime. One hour GBY/JPY on 10 March.

Thanks for The suggestion. I will add the stochastic to my template. Best regards

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Found this one today. Missed the best entry point but will be interested to see how it plays out. However I am curious is this is even valid as I have discounted the 2 points that I have marked with question marks. Any opinions? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #69 ---
After reading the pfd that profitkeeper provided the link to I think I can answer my own question. In my opinion the set up is valid, although it may not be considered a top notch set up as point 4 is lower than point 1.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Good to see you back, I would say that this is another coyote wave that worked. Linda's rule #3 says "point 3 must be lower than point 1" on a bullish set up.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I think your count sequence is fine - but it is another coyote wave that might work. Rule #4 in Linda's PDF says that "point 4 should be higher than point 1" in a bullish setup. Am I getting too technical? GnwFx would be proud. Edit: You must have been posting at the same time. I see you already noticed this.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Amazing!!! 2 weeks and no trolls and no one has posted a Wolfe Wave that was an utter failure.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
No failures yet lol, but plenty time for that as my 2 haven't played out yet . And i'm sure the trolls will be along soon!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Profitkeeper its just a matter of time before the trolls show...its guaranteed. Your thread is good stuff so when they come please don't hesitate to ignore them in their profile so they can't post in your thread anymore. I keep trying to find some old Wolfe wave charts I saved to study and post 'em here so I can contribute to your thread as something other than a know it all.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
This one might be OK, although it is more of a triangle. I don't know whether the double dip at point 5 invalidates the pattern. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It's hard giving setups during the Asian session - they tend to drift sideways. There are a few pairs doing that now.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I had a trailing stop on the AUD/USD because it was a bit questionable setup and I got stopped out at -2 pips. C'est la vie. Watching the hockey game now, so I'll take a break.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Moved the stop again on USD/CAD to 132.85 to lock in 71 pips. I normally don't move the stop so frequently, but this one is certainly trying to fake us out.

I dropped the AUD/USD down to H1 for a better look. It has the same kind of double point 5 that I tried to trade earlier - and didn't work well (BE). It is also a megaphone pattern which I am not keen on but the original PDF shows as OK. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Megaphone pattern? You mean that it is getting wider instead of narrowing? I didn't see that described in the pdf I looked at but that is why I wondered if it was valid as I noticed it anyway.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I'm not seeing many good patterns the last couple of days, then again, I haven't looked very hard.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Here is one I think. The entry point has been missed but it might have worked out well as we seem to have retested the break of the weekly trend line and might be heading lower as per the video I linked. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Although maybe it is a little flat on the top?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Yes, that's what it means. There was one of the examples (actually 2) on the PDF that was a megaphone. (the last one and third to last).

--- 帖子 #102 ---
The sell wasn't taken in relation to the pattern shown. I didn't mean to show the sell at all.

Nice Masilve but I'm more conservative and looking at the 15 min. trendlines. Would like to sell around the top one on a reversal pattern.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
It might work Poocher but I don't know if it is a Wolf Wave pattern as Point 3 is not higher than point 1.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Yes Wizlon lots of traders argue the pennant/flag can't be horizontal but has to point up or down for it to be a Wolfe Wave.

Thanks, Wizlon, Poocher and Masilva for continuing to contribute. I thought I would let the markets settle after the FOMC news and the resulting strong moves. The opportunities for Wolfe Waves dried up some what since WW depends on a bit of ranging activity. I think going forward we should see more setups. Please keep the posts coming even if you are not sure about the setups. Coyote waves still often work, even if not technically correct.

Here is an idea for next week for GBPNZD. Left chart is H1, Right chart is D1 (I have already posted the D1 set up earlier in this thread). H1 looks like it is due a pullback before hopefully continuing. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Just noticed that current price seems to be rejecting from the 161.8 retrace of the point 1 to 2 move. I don't know if this falls in to the normal analysis for these patterns - what do you think profitkeeper? Attached Image

Thanks, I have it in my list to watch... ';-)

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Sorry Wizlon, I've been away for a couple of days. Yes, it looks good and someone posted a while back that the points often correspond with Fib levels. I really haven't looked into it before. I have actually been looking for Wolfe Waves in stocks earlier today, and found a couple of outstanding examples - but unfortunately they were both in the past. Since there are 3 or 4 thousand stocks, it is really just chance that you find one. As far as I know, there is no accurate scanner for WW in either forex or stocks. Here is one stock example. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Edit: I just found a screener that may be useful to those who trade stocks as well as forex. Finviz website has screeners for "wedge up" and "wedge down" in stocks. You can then check the results for Wolf Waves. I found a couple of current ones that way. Maybe someone knows of a similar screener/dashboard for forex. http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=210&amp;s=ta_p_wedgeup

--- 帖子 #128 ---
A couple of brokers that I use provide me with a free subscription to AutoChartist. I think this is similar to a screener. I receive emails containing various patterns that are in the making or I can log in online to view them. To be honest I have not really paid it much attention but I might start to have a quick look when these emails come through to see if anything catches my eye. It doesn't show Wolf Waves but it does show rising / falling wedges and triangles (and various other formations) so same thing really depending on how you interpret it. I also just remembered that I have a the mobile app too.

That seems to be a good site and will add it to post 1 Thanks, Wizlon

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Agreed. Looks more realistic than mine and more accurate regarding the swings within the pattern.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Here is Gold H1. Current PA looks like a bearish flag - this might spark a move down to produce point 5. Lets see.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I checked out autochartist rising and falling wedges on Oanda and it was interesting. If you redraw the lines they have, a couple of their failed patterns on strictly wedge patterns, they were actually successful patterns if you drew them as Wolfe Waves. Anyway this could be a good resource for finding patterns. Thanks Wizlon for mentioning Autochartist. If you go to technical analysis in Oanda FX Trade platform (left side), they have a full analysis available - not just current recommendations.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
No problem, hopefully it will help us. In the site that I posted the link to he talks about fib ratios with Wolf Waves a little. He said point 3 and 5 can be a 127 or 162 reteacement from the previous wave. So regarding my H1 gold chart above, here is an idea..... Attachment Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Nested WW? This is GJ 15 min...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Greetings JohnnyR, Your 5 min chart was nice for a quick run, but I think it may have been one of my Coyote waves (which is fine) because point 3 should be below point 1. But hey, it worked just as several of my early ones did. The 15 min chart actually looks like it is a rising pattern which means that point #1 should be at the top. Good to get some contributions. Please keep it up.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Took a second look with #1 at the top, but it still is not a purist WW, since #3 in this case should be above point #1 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Thanks for the feedback... maybe we should call them "profitkeeper waves" lol The thing that caught my eye with your first posts, is seeing the trendline break at "5" and then the recovery and run. I see this as a "slingshot" and that is one element of trading that has fooled me time and again. I'm just a sucker for that action! The way you made your posts and examples opened my eyes, and now I know how to look for them. Cheers, JR

I missed this M15 WW a few hours ago - but it hit target for a 31 pip gain. It had quite an excursion to point 5, but it was valid. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thought that I would post this to show what happened next. Also it is worth noting that the target almost hit the 62% Fib of the previous swing. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #151 ---
OK just to wrap up the Gold WW that I posted above, so far it has not reached the target but personally I closed after the spike up and am more than happy with how it worked out. In fact I would go as far as to say it was a doubly successful Wolf Wave as I was able to short from point 4 with a TP order placed at the 161.8 fib of points 3-4 which was my predicted projection for point 5. I also placed a buy limit at this point which was triggered nicely. Hope you managed to catch some of that Profitkeeper and also some of the others who pop in here from time to time. EDIT: I didn't actually short from point 4, but I shorted from about that level at the open on Sunday night. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Maybe not the best pattern but this is UsdJpy H1. Point 4 messes it up a bit I think. Attached Image Point 4 could be moved to the next blue pin bar up but then point 4 would be slightly higher than point 2.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Good question. I feel either way is OK, but maybe someone has a definitive answer. Obviously the profit target would be different. We have already moved 30 pips or so depending on the entry.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thanks JohnnyR and Umpats for the contributions. Could I ask contributors to draw all 3 lines if possible, so that anyone new can see the pattern more clearly. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I am surprised there is not more interest in this thread. These set ups are accurate a lot of the time and they appear often in the charts on all TF. Maybe we should record the win rate of all set ups that posted (as long as they are valid set ups). Wolf Waves will always be a part of my trading now. Thanks Profitkeeper.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Check this out. I just wanted to try something out and did a bit of back testing. I know some of these patterns may not be ideal but I think they are all valid. This just shows how common, useful, and profitable these patterns are. This is USDJPY H1. Only 1 did not hit its target line, but still would have made a profit. The current one is still playing out.

Thanks PK !! I am so much love with WW that, I want to take his course, but my shoe string budget doesn't allow me and I don't know what "advance" lessons he teaches, other than the basics in the above pdf file. Yeah !! Stay in touch and thanks for starting this thread.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I agree that $3,000 USD is a lot to pay for a course where you have no idea how much you will benefit. I don't know why course providers don't get creative with their fees. For instance, if say Mr. W believes in his course and $3,000 is what he is sure it is worth, why not have an arrangement with a broker, where the potential student will deposit that money into the broker for the student to use for trading WW for one year. At the end of the year, $3,000 is withdrawn by Mr. W for his fee, and the balance of the account is owned by the student who should have been able to at least double his account in that year. Motivation would be there for both the student and course provider to make sure the student is profitable and monitoring trades would be more direct. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I agree. but for successful trading one require money, method and risk management (&amp; psychology). And this is just a method. So, no body can grantee success in this business. Now, what happens is when losing streak starts, (this happens with WW so many times), people start blaming the method and start their quest for new method. (I have done this number of times. LoL !!)

--- 帖子 #176 ---
If going strictly with rules, No. It says two lines must converge. But, Flat channel and megaphone can also be reversal pattern, hence price can come down.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I tend to agree with you Dan, however Linda (friend of Bill Wolfe) illustrates a couple of megaphone patterns in her PDF in the first post. I would only disqualify this pattern because point 5 never reached the top trend line (if it is drawn from the peaks of 1 &amp; 3). As you imply though, it may still work. Thanks for your post Jalby and welcome.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Ok so things are a bit slow today due to various bank holidays so I decided to have a look at some longer time frame charts to see what opportunities I could find. I found plenty of Wolf Waves that have already played out and I will post a couple to highlight some of the techniques that I read in the various pdfs and other links that have been posted here. I hope this is ok with you Profitkeeper. As I have said before these patterns are new to me and this is obviously just my interpretation of what can be quite subjective patterns. This chart below is EurJpy Monthly. The 1st pattern is obviously long gone but I really liked this pattern. Point 5 hit the 1-3 line pretty much to the pip and then never really looked back. By the time it hit the projected target line it had climbed about 2000 pips. But it didn't stop there - it carried on to climb about another 3500 pips. The 2nd pattern is not completed yet but is a potential to watch out for. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I had a bit of fun with this one and I will be keeping an eye on it with the hope of making a shed load of pips! It is GbpJpy Monthly. There is a lot going on here and I will try to explain what I've done for those who may be unfamiliar. Point 1 and 3 are established so I drew a parallel line from point 2 to predict an area for point 4.Price may not reach this line (ideally it won't). I have drawn the red dotted lines as the distance from 2 to 4 may be similar to the distance from point 1 to 3 (uniformity). The little green arrows are just to show that point 4 could be somewhere around that area. Notice how point 3 was at approx the 161.8 fib of point 1 to 2. I also plotted the fib of point 3 to my predicted point 4 to project the 161.8 retrace as an guide to where point 5 might form. (hope i'm not losing anyone). The blue dotted lines is something that I have been trying as another way to predict point 5. I have drawn a line from point 2 to point 3, copied it and pasted it at the point of my predicted point 4. Once point 4 is clearly established I can have another look at this. I think that is about it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #180 ---
This chart is an example of how to use a parallel line from point 2 to 4 and project it from point 3 to find the sweetspot for point 5. Bill Wole also said that he sometimes will project it from point 1. This is CadJpy Weekly. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I have found that the best application of Wolfe Wave is the ending diagonal - it's the 5th wave of an impulse Elliott Wave sequence or the C wave in a corrective wave sequence ABC

--- 帖子 #187 ---

Wow, You guys are getting way ahead of me. Great work !!! I'm going to have to take WW more seriously. I just finished reading the latest PDF and the recent posts. It seemed so simple when I started this thread, but several new concepts are creeping in. I hadn't thought of the Elliot Wave tie in - I always vaguely related WW to harmonic patterns. What do you make of Bill Wolf's PDF? It almost seems like a copy of someone's lessons complete with post-it notes. It took me a while to figure out that the description under each chart actually referred to a chart on the next page - then it made sense.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hey Wizlon, This is the top of the wave you just posted - for another 4,000 or so pips. I know it is one of my coyote or PK waves (horizontal), but it looks nice. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Maybe I shouldn't be posting non conforming waves - it may confuse people.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
From the Bill Wolfe PDF, I do like the idea of being prepared to take profit at the horizontal from point 4. This chart shows the advantage, where price stopped at that point and did not continue to the target. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I think a good strategy would be to scale out. Take partial profit as in the chart above this post (if price looks like reversing). Take more profit at the 1 - 4 extension as originally intended in WW set ups and then just leave the rest to run and see what happens. For me I think this is the only way I could stay in a trade long enough to make 8000 pips or more. Personally I don't think it matters if some patterns do not conform perfectly. As we have already seen in this thread even the less than perfect patterns can still generate good profit and that's why we are all in this game. As long as it is made clear that they are "coyote" or "PK" patterns then hopefully people will not get confused.

Hello Umpats, As profitkeeper has already said it is quite difficult to make the patterns out on your charts. It would be easier if you strip away your indicators and post the patterns with the 3 lines highlighting the pattern. That way it would be easier to give you feedback or jump in on trades with you.

an example for me wenn i am searching WW

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Ok Umpats, that is much clearer and I can see where you are going wrong. If the wedge that you identify is sloping upwards then Point 1 must be at the upper TL. If it is sloping downwards then point 1 should be at the lower TL. Also in a rising wedge point 3 and 5 should always be higher than point 1. Or lower than point 1 in a falling wedge. Point 4 should always higher than point 1 in a falling wedge or lower than point 1 if the wedge is rising. I recommend that you pick one of the examples that has been posted in this thread and find it on your charts. Practice drawing your lines on it and then look for more patterns. Look for patterns that have already completed until you fully understand and then look for patterns in the making. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #213 ---

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi teatime, You have the right idea; however both of the charts you posted are more or less horizontal patterns which are technically not wolfe Waves. I looked at these myself earlier and rejected them for this reason. The second chart actually looks to be slanting up slightly which means the count should start at the top. They still might work, although be very cautious. There doesn't seem to as many WW ocurring as when I started the thread. They seem to come in bunches on the higher time frames. I don't normally look for them below M30 charts. Also see Wizlon's post above for point positions.

Thanks, Wolfe Waves are not the only thing I trade, but I think I have traded approx. 14 or 15 WW (maybe more). Out of those, I have only had one outright loss and about 5 where I have closed the trade before the ultimate profit target was reached. The rest reached their profit target. Some of the WW I traded were not technically correct aka Coyote waves (see earlier in the thread). By the way, one of my systems does involve one indicator (Stochastics). All trades are real accounts (no demos).

As said above, Wolfe Waves are very powerful. I've been looking at these patterns for a while, but never really got my head around them. Thank goodness for this thread, which renewed my prior interest. A light went off in my head and now I can see the waves everywhere, on any time frame. I fired up four trades last night(D1 TF), each of which showed good potential. It was interesting to see that in every case, at least for my trades, stochastics was either overbought, or oversold, and price was at the upper or lower Bollinger Band. When I checked my terminal this morning, I was very happy to see a combined 200-pip gain in just nine hours. If all four trades hit my target points, the total would be over 1000 pips. Can't guarantee that will happen, but, for the first time in several Forex trading years, I feel like I've got something I can really use to make some money. Another thank you to the OP for shining a light on this price pattern. Chicago

I found something that may or may not interest you since it is a little off topic: I also trade harmonic patterns - but usually only the Scott Carney "approved patterns" when they are very distinct, however if you look at the non-mainstream patterns that are part of the Zup indicator, you will find that most of the "Black Swan" patterns are also Wolfe Waves. I am attaching the GBP/CAD pattern that Wizlon found (post 242) but with a Black Swan overlaid on the H1 chart. By the way, I'm trading this when the market settles after the weekend.

Update: The GBP/CAD trade was a bit frustrating for me. After entering, price went sideways for 10 hours, then I went to bed. While I was sleeping, price jumped 160 pips then retraced . This morning, I closed both positions for 46 and 41 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I don't like trailing stops (which would have worked well last night) so next time I have an overnight trade I might use Scott Carney's method of having profit targets of 38% and 62% of the entire pattern and an ultimate profit target where the pattern indicates. Example from the above trade: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It would also have worked well on the AUD/NZD trade above which I didn't enter. (post 251)

Hello profitkeeper, Wolfe Waves have always been an interesting concept to me but I have always had a bit of a problem getting my head round them so thanks for explaining things on your thread in a straightforward way. I thought I'd have a look at the very first example you showed in your first post. I was interested in it as it penetrated below point 5 for a while before ultimately reaching target and I was wondering where a logical place for the stop would need to be to keep one in the trade. I'm not sure where you would put your stop but in this case, a stop 2 ATRs away would have just kept one in the trade and it ended up just over 3R in profit. Interesting, taking onboard your point about stochastics, if one had waited for it to have exited oversold, this coincided with a bullish pinbar and an entry point pretty much the same as when price first hit point 5 whereupon price went straight up and you'd never have been in drawdown. Would you say that this is a logical approach?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
​One to keep an eye on perhaps although stochs are only just heading into oversold. I've marked where the stop based on 2 x ATR would go.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Not a perfect bounce off the 5-point, but it looks like it's setting up for a long trade.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Looks good' but which pair and Time Frame?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
USDCHF, D1

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Jack and welcome, Yes stops are always a bit subjective when price does not immediately turn after penetrating line 1-5. Your idea is good, but I would like to wait for a white (bullish) candle to close above the line. That does not always help 100% and sometimes you get a 'double dip' at point 5. 2 ATRs seems like a big stop, and I would almost prefer to get prematurely stopped out and re-enter when it is apparent that the pattern will work. I know that this is easier said than done. The last pinbar along with stochastics was probably the best indicator that price would turn, then I would put the stop below the pinbar. I will keep a watch on the USD/CAD chart.

Hi ChicagoRob, I just thought I'd mention that your EU daily trade seems to be stuck between the 50 and 62% retracement of the last swing, although you probably noticed. This could mean another leg up. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I did notice. I trail all my trades, so I was able to take some decent pips off the table. I always leave some "wiggle-room," but if I see a loss in momentum, I tighten the SL and let it stop itself out. There's always another opportunity waiting around the corner.

Sometimes Wolfe Waves will keep you out of a bad trade. I was bored and looked at a well known signal service for stocks. They recommended a buy (at the red arrow).

Dax Daily. The Weekly chart looks nicer (more compact) but I am showing the daily so I can highlight last Thursdays candle. Not quite a Dark Cloud Cover as it did not close below the 50% line of the previous candle but definitely bearish none the less. The red squares just highlight some similar candles which all preceded bearish moves. And price is currently between the 61.8 and 78.6 Fib sweetspot from the previous LH to LL move. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #303 ---
It's a failed WW, but could still turn into a potential winner. If I saw bearish momentum, I'd be inclined to put in a sell-stop below the 1-3-5 line.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Why is it a failed WW? The way I see it price is currently in the sweet zone. By copying the 2 to 4 line and projecting it from 3 gives us the sweet zone. i.e the area between the dotted line in the above chart and the 1 to 5 line.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
In your example, which is an ascending wedge, price should respect the 1-3-5 line, which is resistance. It breeched the line, so I don't consider it to be a classic WW.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thats not right ChicagoRob. As I stated above, price is currently in the sweet zone. This is according to the teachings of Bill Wolfe and you can find that information in the pdf's that are available in this thread. And many of the examples in the thread have point 5's that overshoot. It is even acceptable to extend the 2 -4 line from point 1to get the sweet zone depending on how the pattern shapes up.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Here is a post from Profitkeeper which can be found on page 2 of this thread.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Whatever, bro. I base my trading decisions on price action and momentum. For me, the 1-3-5 line is the line in the sand. Sometimes, it's tough for this old dog to learn new tricks!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Whatever bro? lol. Ok but you should understand this because if you're trading Wolfe Waves then these point 5 over shoots are perfectly tradable and I think there will be plenty more of these examples in this thread. Considering Wolfe Waves are counter trend set ups I would say you are trading against the momentum.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I play price momentum, once a turning-point has been established. The entire strategy can be boiled down to support/resistance, swing points, and price exhaustion.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Guys, guys... You both have different perspectives on WW, and I hate to say it ChicagoRob, but Wizlon is correct. It is actually preferable for point 5 to breach line 1-3, but it is not incorrect for it not to breach 1-3. You are both the main contributors to this thread and please continue with your contributions. We have come a long way - from a very sketchy original definition of WW to now arguing over one of the finer points, but both of you have correctly formed WW which is the main thing and is very helpful to anyone trying to grasp the concept for the first time. I'll find the PDF that was contributed earlier and replace the one on the first post with it since it is a bit clearer.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Why do you hate to say that I was correct? lol just kidding. We're all on the same side and I hope I didn't upset ChicagoRob as that certainly wasn't my intention. Below is GBPUSD H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You're right, wizlon32: we're all on the same side. I'm looking at gbpusd H4, also. I have to say that I'm having great success with Wolfe Waves: high profit factor and very low DD. As soon as I get some more trades under my belt, I'll post my results. We should "walk-the-walk," right?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
wizlon32, I see you are using divergence as part of your arsenal.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Well you see it is a delicate situation. I have a Brit (Wizlon) on one side and an American on the other (ChicagoRob) and a Canadian (me) in the middle - it goes all the way back to the Boston Tea party and the war of 1812. Besides, I have to be nice to Americans in case we get an influx of Trump refugees ( there is already a huge spike in immigration inquiries from the USA at Canadian immigration).

I can't really post my graph like yours, because I trade 3 different systems in forex over 2 accounts. Maybe I'll dedicate a third account to WW. Again, I am impressed with your results. A profit factor of 5.96 is outstanding. Thanks for posting.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
No, you did everything right. As you realize, point 5 was a bit questionable. It's more difficult on a 1 minute chart IMHO. You don't have time to think about whether trend is reversing. I would have probably closed the trade at break even if I was watching it at that time - if not, I would have taken a loss. It happens.

​Well I'm glad I didn't do this one as the 2 x ATR stop would now have been hit. Waiting for stochastics to exit oversold would not have worked either of course as price was then butting up to the underside of the 1 to 5 line which was acting as resistance and it never took out the high of that bar anyway.

I've not heard or before either. Found some info by doing a google search and it appears to be a rule that a guy made up. Here is a piece of info describing it but it does not make easy reading so I have highlighted the part thattells us what the rule does. THE GEO: An alternative geometry arises from the "Geo", with "Tunneling" and "Geo Anchor" requirements being met. A decline to the foreground Model-defined targets would allow the Geo 0.03% to attain a 5-prime or 5-second adverse excursion relative to the WW's 1-3 Line, in which case, the OffSet Rule would apply and this target a reversal to the price level of Point-4, and not the 1-4 Line as the WW would have it (the former representing the highest probability attainment from a 5-prime position, or to the price level corresponding to Point-3 if reversing from a 5-second locus - i.e.: OffSet Rule of the Geo 0.03% ).

I guess that is probably a question for Profitkeeper to answer but as far as I am concerned I wouldn't mind seeing them in any charts, futures or otherwise. It would just reinforce how common and profitable these patterns can be.

Nice usdjpy bounce off the line, and a pinbar to boot.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
​Hello Rob, I was wondering how you draw your 1 to 5 line, it seems in this instance to be off the candle body at point 1 and not quite sure where at point 3. The lines I've drawn look a bit different.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
The line isn't perfect - I suppose it would be an early entry, if based on the wicks. But, the Wolfe Wave spirit is there, and I liked the price action, especially in light of the pinbar. I tend to be pretty strict with the pattern, but every now and then, I will use discretion. I'm trailing the position, so no matter what, I'll get a piece of the pie. If price goes back down to the 1-3-5 line and bounces, I will put in another long trade.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Welcome PipMint. Futures are fine with me, as a matter of fact some brokers like Oanda include futures CFDs. By the way Oanda just announced that they are reducing their maximum spreads .

--- 帖子 #354 ---
OK, you and ChicagoRob are in an interesting spot. If you look at the charts you posted, they are actually megaphone patterns - not wedges. I have no objection to that, and one of the first PDF's (Linda's) actually had a couple of those patterns, although I can find no mention of them in the descriptions available. As for point 5 falling short, I'm not so sure. But hey, some of the first WW I posted were definitely not purist and they worked. I guess just use extra caution, but the pin bar helped in this pattern.

​ I thought I'd have a quick look at a 5 min DOW chart and just found this one. Not a wedge but a megaphone pattern, be interesting to see if it completes. As an aside, ideally I like to see divergence between points 3 &amp; 5 suggesting possible exhaustion, not present in this example however.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Found this in audusd 4h! A small WW inside a big WW. I have taken a buy position expecting it to complete the small WW first, and i will short it once it reaches my top questionmark and expect it to come down to my bottom questionmark in the longer run. What do you guys think of WW inside WW?

Did u take the trade i plotted to run up again? I don't have access to DOW index, so maybe you could post it, just to see if the lines i drew in actually hit the target. It would be a good learning experience for me.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
​Hi, Based on where you've drawn your lines, no, the target was not hit. I'm not sure however if I would have drawn the lines where you have though. I use the high/low of the bar rather than draw the line through the candle body and I thought that for a bullish Wolfe Wave, point 2 needs to be higher than point 4 so I'm not sure this one qualifies anyway.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Great! Thanks for the feedback! Learning by doing is far better than learning by reading for me, so i learned something new from you! And you are right, it doesn't seem to qualify.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
​There seems to be no end of possibilities with these Wolfe Waves. This is a DOW 10 pip Renko Mean chart, almost made it to target but if you bailed on the stochastic crossover at the high would still have been a profitable trade.

Where would your entry point be on this one? Do you wait till a bearish bar closes below the 1-3-5 line, or take the entry on your chart based on the fib level? Rob

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Rob, The answer to your question is the point that we disagreed on when I initially posted it. For me an overshoot at point 5 is preferential. I like to project the 2 to 4 line from point 3 to give me a trade entry zone. The bearish candle that I highlighted was right at the top of that "sweet spot" and I entered at market open on Sunday night as I trade Dax with a broker that has similar trading times for Dax as for Forex (not the chart I posted so as not to cause confusion). Considering that this was a daily chart I would be wary of entering at such a lower area as below the 1 to 5 line, but that's just me. I also use indicators for confirmation, such as the Awesome Oscillator. By dropping down to the H1 chart the AO showed a nice divergence. That along with my CCI/MA cross was all I needed and it paid off. Also as I said the HTF was making Lower lows and lower highs. The current retrace was in between the 61.8 and 78.6 Fib which was ideal for a short entry.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi JackAntigua, Your Stochastic divergence is all at point 5. The divergence I like to see is from point 3 to 5. That's not to say that your example isn't relative though, it's just a bit different. Personally I don't use the ETA in my analysis at all. I get the feeling that Bill Wolfe just chucked that in there to make his patterns seem more technical. What about you, do you use it?

​I'm not quite sure, I guess some might say it's a failed WW because of the time it has already spent above the 1-3-5 line. It's also hit the 2-4 line projected from point 3 on a number of occasions but as you say, now we've got divergence it may be the trigger to take price down. Good luck with your trade.

Took this trade on AudCad 4hour. Price overshot 5 - check! Price should now move up to at least the lower 4 line - this is conservative target zone. Or it could go to touch the actual 4 line - aggressive target zone.

​I'd be careful with this one, at point 3 on my data the bar low was higher than at point 1 with an absence of the prominent lower wick you have on your chart.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Yeah i see it on dailyfx.com, there is no lower wick. But on my fxpro MT4 demo account there is a wick, and its identical to my Activtrades MT5 real account. Why this discrepancy do you think? Also, do you have any nice chart setups for the coming week?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
​Different brokers, different prices I guess, and some are worse than others. Markets with a centralised exchange such as futures don't suffer this of course. I haven't really looked at any setups yet, probably do so in the morning.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Right now on DJI30 (30 min chart). I am in doubt with the number 1. Is it valid?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
yours is bearish WW.on the lowest(dippest) levels we look for bullish WW.it seems conradictive

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Thank you for your reply. I wasn't sure if I could accept the point 1 as valid. But the price didn't come back across 1-3-5 line so it wasn't fullfilled WW anyway. Today I catched another one, EURGBP (1 hour chart). What do you think? Correct setup?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Took this trade on CADJPY 15m. Had a chance to get a short in above the 5 point. Does this look like a good WW-pattern?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
yes.it is.but we had better take into account divergencences amid 1-3-5.imho any pattern isnt credible 100%( harmonics; WW)

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Welcome Koulus. Nice trade. I've been taking time away from trading to work on another project. Life gets in the way sometimes, but nice to see trades are happening.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
CADJPY 15min update. So i have been experimenting a bit with the overshooting of the 5 line. It's hard for me to know where the overshooting actually reverses and starts to head down, so i came up with a new strategy. I always enter at the touch of the 5 line, and i double my initial position at the 1.89 fib of the 4-5 LEG, and quadruple my inital position at the 2.89 fib with a stop-loss at the 3.5 fib for all orders. When the overshooting of the 5 line is so high, my profit target is at the horisontal 4 line, not the projected 1-4 line going down. You may ask why the horisontal 4 line? It's a more modern rule which i found it in this youtube video at around 1:43 to 2.23. Inserted Video So what happend? I had entered a short yesterday a bit above the 5 line because i was late and didn't actually catch it happening live. Then i set up these levels with sell-limit orders and take profit target yesterday, and when i woke up today i was amazed by the result! It had hit the perfect top and the perfect bottom! I just had to share this finding with you guys because it was so weird. What do you guys think of this? Was this just pure luck?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
USDJPY, H1 What do you think?

--- 帖子 #405 ---
GBPNZD (4 hour chart) right now. I am not sure about the trade because of yesterday's news. There is also no divergence but the pattern looks good. So we will see.

A nice write up on Wolfe Waves is at http://thepatternsite.com/WolfeWaveBull.html

--- 帖子 #407 ---
The thread has been quiet for the last week. I know there seems to have been fewer opportunities over that time, but I'm wondering if maybe everything that needs to be said - has been said. Personally, I haven't been around much to participate so I will post a few more WW as they appear and see if there is further interest. Normally I like to post the pattern as it hits point 5, but this one just reached profit target so I thought I would post it: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Sorrry for the very late follow up - welcome Ad-Maiora. You have the right idea, but the waves were really in a channel (a mistake I used to make). They should be in a wedge formation - it helps to draw lines 1-3 and 2-4 as I have done above.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Sorry for being so late in commenting Body, but I have been otherwise occupied. Congrats on your trade. To answer your question, luck played a part as it does in all trades, but it looked good anyway. Same comment as above - try and pick trades where there is a distinct wedge shape - they are generally more reliable.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Thank you Profitkeeper! I hit my first milestone today! Account grown from 100 dollar to 1000 dollar since 10th of May, so little less than a month, and i owe it to this thread and the people contributing here. So thanks a bunch people!! Keep those nice charts coming.... And before anyone comments on it, yeah - I have taken a bit high risk but i never felt uncomfortable with the positions.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Congratulations!!!! That's quite a feat Body.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Agree with TheBody. WWs have been very good to me - I've made more money, with less DD, than with any other system, strategy, or indicator.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi to all.i am happy to find this thread. I used ww for 4 years but i have never find ebok about it and with strict rules. Also there is estimatated price and estimated time of arival eat that price when there is triangle formation. I will post picture later on but i must to write this becouse i am very happy to find somebody knows about amasing wolfe waves. Congratulations on great profit to THE Body. Keep up the good work to profitkeeper.

EUR/JPY Daily Is this a likely Wolfe Wave pattern? Thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #415 ---
It's possible although you could argue that point 5 has already been created and the pattern hasn't completed. But we are now back at the line again and it does look a bit more symmetrical this time, not sure that has anything to do with it though.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Here is my take on EURJPY Daily! I wouldn't personally trade it for a number of reasons. First off, it could take several months for it to play out, and i dont have the patience to wait for it that long, nor do i have a big enough account to suffer the drawdown if it should hit the Stop-loss, even with micro-lots. And most importantly, there is gonna be some highly volatile days/weeks ahead when UK decides about staying or leaving the EU, and then you will have a response from the BOJ (Bank of Japan) at some point. On a side-note, the Price Action looks like an inverted/inverse cup and handle formation, which indicate a big bearish momentum, but since this is a WW pattern thread i wont go into details about that. Does the Price Action already know that the UK will leave EU???? It certainly looks like it to me!

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Here is the weekly chart.The pattern looks ok to me. TheBody is right though it could take some time to play out. If I was going to trade this pattern I would keep an eye out for a Daily Pin Bar or Bullish engulfing candle. Could be worth a shot in my opinion Brexit could alsobe a problem.

Interesting. The drop doesn't look half as scary on a monthly chart. Of course, the target price is not necessarily the stopping point, but a good indicator never the less. Nice to hear from you Wab.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Thanks for all the charts PK &amp; others. I 1st heard about WW several years ago, but could not find them. The numbers seemed to be very subjective, and I couldn't remember the order. After looking at several pages of charts, they now stand out much better.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Gotta give it a shot; AudCad M15. Setting up, Maybe...

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi diamond, I never say never, but it looks like price has already dropped below your point 4. I usually find it easier to draw the wedge shape first. That is connect 1 &amp;3 then 2&amp;4. Price should stay within those bounds except for point 5 which is usually just beyond line 1 - 3.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Correct. Price just now dropped below 4, making this trade totally unsavory for me.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I'm in this CadChf long. It's about 1:2.1 R:R. On these, my plan is to only take those offering 1:2 minimum. Update: Cratered. I'll have another look after markets open.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Welcome diamonddbw! I'm no expert, but i think in reference to your CadChf, the point 3 needs to be lower than point 1, and point 5 needs to be lower than point 3 for it to be a valid WW-formation. I hope someone else corrects me if this is wrong.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I think you are one wave behind in your analysis. I believe the sequence should have started at the swing high before wave one on the chart, which would have resulted in a short trade.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Thanks TheBody &amp; ChicagoRob. I'm currently in the lab rewiring my neural network... :nerd:

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Not too many waves posted lately, so I thought I'd post this one that triggered in the NY session yesterday Attached Image (click to enlarge) There was a couple of spots you could have entered, but generally I like to enter on a close below the 1 - 3 line (for upward wedge). Price didn't quite make it to the traditional profit target, but hit two of the alternate targets: 1. horizontal line from point 4 2. 62% fib of the whole pattern.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
​Hi PK, I was wondering, should point 1 not be the highest point (up to that point)? There was a higher point just to the left which could be point 1.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi Jack, Good point, and normally that's what I would look at. In this case point 1 was an interim high and there is precedent for this in one of the PDFs at the start of the thread. I've added the alternate point 1. It would still have worked but with a slightly bigger stop loss and a smaller profit. Some may argue that in this case line 1 - 3 is too horizontal, but I'm OK with it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Still about 100pips

--- 帖子 #438 ---
OK, out of the lab, for the moment. Just saw this in EurAud M15. To me, it looks valid. Weigh in if you have any comments... Please. The Red vertical, arrow, and circles may be the textbook target areas. Comments on this, please, as well.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Looks good to me.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks for checking PK. I may only shoot for the area of the #4 horizontal. Right above there is quite a lot of resistance. Now trailing by about 53 pips, so risk is less than 15 pips. I got up late today, otherwise I might have seen it soon enough to get in around #5. Wishful thinking...

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Looks good to me, also.

Is it OK? Attached Image

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Welcome gulaksarker. You are on the right track. I would only suggest that you be more precise with your lines. Point 1 on the NZD should be at a high. If you did that, it would change the whole formation. It still may work, but not very clean. As shown below: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The Body is correct in his comment on your previous post.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Is this a correct Wolf Wave trade? Greetings, TheJube.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ imho, this set is the 'ugly step child' of a Wolfe Wave.. LOL What I'm seeing is perhaps, fudging on #3 point, by not taking the absolute top. Same thing with choice of #2, which (imho) should have been the previous swing, which is lower than the one marked. #2, for my interpretation, should be more clearly defined, instead of a large range extending for over a week. But then again, I'm just a student like yourself...

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I do have the ChfJpy, M15, on my radar. Still quite early, but have identified a potential #2, which then allows me to search for #1, and then, potential #3 MAY be setting up.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
In yesterday's EurAud, M15 trade, I did end up breaking even after a very late entry. The Yellow dashed lines, highlight 1st trade. The Aqua solid lines are for follow-up trade. What this chart shows is a new WW setting up During my existing trade. I failed to see it, so only ended up going to BE. It was possible to make money going both ways, by leaving the 1st trade after seeing #5 form on 2nd trade, which would have given me 25. Or, I could have taken profit closer to Yellow Horizontal line for a slightly larger profit. Meanwhile, the 2nd trade did not hit optimum target, there was opportunities to trail, and perhaps, take profit once price hit Trade two's #4 horizontal.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hahahahaha LOL XD. And this one? Is this our Wolf Wafe Step sisters' half-brother? Anyways TP hit

--- 帖子 #453 ---

--- 帖子 #455 ---
I think your point 4 needs to be at the swing low. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And pardon my poor Paint skills!

--- 帖子 #456 ---
My advice is always try to take some profit(half) at the horisontal 4 line, and let the rest run at break even +1 untill u get stopped out or hit the 1-4 upwards line. My tip about the horisontal 4 line : take profit when it has reached 89% of the highest point, nothing more frustrating to see price return down just before reaching it.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
My view.​

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Thanks for your view and reply Jack. Can you point me to where i can read more about the time-elapse of the wolf waves? I can't recall reading about it. -Thebody-

--- 帖子 #459 ---
​Hiya, It's not something I've particularly read about, it just seems logical to me that you don't want price to spend a lot of time below point 5, and particularly below the parallel of 2 to 4 projected from point 3. I'm attaching an excerpt from the Wolfe Waves Full Explanation document in which he talks a bit about the 2 to 4 line. The full document is also attached.

Ha! Ha! Ha! I only trade Eur-Aud on m5-m1. It's my best friend. Thank You for this thread, Profitkeeper. A very very good idea!! I'll post many other charts. But....i'm so sorry, my English is...

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi Profitkeeper, you are right, but I prefer to close the trade when it's late, and Friday afternoon is very poor in volume. In some market conditions everything can happen...I prefer to put the pips in my pocket, I don't care to leave some "on the table", the day after I can find many other opportunities. About the 1 minute, I can assure the there are many opportunities everyday on 1 minute chart. It has the problem about the spread on some pair, and there is no time to post them here before confirmation, if you do the wave is already in action.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Is this a proper way of using Wolfe Waves? Trying to make sure I understand this correctly.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Completely wrong. Point 5 must be a HH or a LL (or at least at the same level of 1 and 3, but is rare like a triple top or bottom). In your first wave it is a LH. The second wave I don't understand, too messy...but I thing that in any case 5 is out from the Sweet zone. Anyway, the pdf in the first post explains it better..or there are many sources online.

Nice, another one is creting on AudUsd..but today there is NFP, so be careful.

It could also work, but it's ugly and Gbp could be a falling knife. Don't trade all the Wolfe Waves you see. Tray to select better them and trade only the best setup.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Alright but based on what criteria should I filter them? That looked like a promising entry, at least to me I mean did I do something wrong with the fake brakeout part ? Another reason for my entry were the positive GBP news

--- 帖子 #494 ---
The entry seems good. Than you got stopped. You could enter again if there area new conditions. Filter them...some idea can be symmetry between the legs (in that case leg 3-4 is small, but respects the rules), and also finding S/R areas can help to get a better win rate

--- 帖子 #495 ---
This morning (in France), there was a Wolfe on Usd -jpy, H1 (chart on post 489). And good NFP.... No trade (NFP...), but just an example of Wolfes wave. :=)

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hey Profitkeeper thanks for starting this thread! I really like trading wolfe waves and happy to see a place like this sharing ideas on it. Still working my way thru all the older posts. I only trade the ES and just intraday for now so I'll only be able to post examples from that. Here is one for you guys that was setting up just prior to the RTH open on the 15min. I only trade the RTH session so I didn't take it but I had it in the back of my mind when trying to take in the context for the day. I'm new to Forex Factory forum so I hope my image gets uploaded ok.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Wanted to show another example of how I use Wolfe Waves on a 1min chart. I generally will only use these entries if I feel pretty confident about the overall direction of the market. It also helps if I see point 5 lining up with a support area, in the 1min example I've hilighted it, in the example I posted this AM point 5 was running into PDH where I expected to see a reaction anyways. Also on this 1min example you will see a short term Tick extreme which I remember Bill Wolfe talking about, although he uses Dow Jones Tick, but I prefer NYSE TICK. Further by the time we came down into point 5 we were making a divergence on the TICK. 1-4 line target was made easily and you could have exited on the Tick Divergence once we broke the ONH, or manage however based on discretion. If you looked at Market internals at the time everything was quite positive.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Here's a couple more examples of how I was using some micro wolfe waves to get on board a larger trend up. The one thing I don't like about using a 1min Wolf Wave is obviously the targets are not going to be huge, but if you play them in the right context, they can be nice ways to get into a bigger trend. Had I managed to catch either of these the R:R would have been pretty nice! My bias today was long again, and I was hoping to find the LOD or first higher low sometime this am, but missed both shots as explained. I generally like to focus on the opening couple of hours so my plays for the day are done. Curious what you guys have found that adds to the success of your wolfe wave trades. One thing I think could also be useful that I don't hear much about is correlation with similar markets, if your market is making a point 5 while a correlated market is making a higher or equal low, I think that would put the odds more in your favor. I like to use the YM and the NQ to a lesser extent when trading the ES. I think the concept of using correlated markets to confirm your trade can help a lot even in forex. Anyways that's just one idea.

Hi Robin! Very interesting method! It works well, Thanks! Eur Aud- m1

--- 帖子 #500 ---
And the same method as Robin. Very strong point 5.... Eur aud- m1

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hey nice trades Tyross! I would normally call it a day after am session, but if we get a strong trend day and I feel pretty confident on my longer term bias, I might try again in the afternoon. So after a kind of foolish attempt fade a spike in a strong market, I ended up finding this baby wolf to take with the trend higher. At least I had something to show for todays efforts, I was pretty annoyed I was not able to participate in the big move up. I think partly why I faded that first trade. Always learning.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Didn't trade today due to Rollover, but just wanted to point out how you can find so many of these 1min Wolf's every day!

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Interesting, clear divergence there as well.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
A nice opportunity Sunday night for those trading the higher time frames. I think I have to consider swing trading or using the higher time frames to get bigger targets for my trades. Here's one attempt to use 120min chart for context and entry on the 1min.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
HI, nice trades. Is Wolve waves your main strategy?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hey Pep17 It's not what I would call my main strategy. Generally I like to look more at the context of the market, to me that is my main objective and it is what will drive my decision making for most of the day. Most days I look for what I consider will be the "play for the day" or am session would be more accurate. If I have the right context I will look for any number of ways of getting in (setups) of which Wolfe waves is just one of them. But I do really like them when they setup! It's a very nice pattern to work off of and good risk reward as you know! It's sort of contrarian in nature and that suits my personality too, so it's a natural fit, and I will see them all the time.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I have a simple rule on this strategy... No Wedge... No Wolfe Wave.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hey Ted, yeah I like that rule, my preference is the wedgier the better, the 120min setup was almost like parallel lines but there were other stuff too going on that made me want to try that one. I'm out my last car at 48.75 wish I had one more to hold on to, I think we could see some follow thru tomorrow if it remains weak by EOD.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
I often over look that Wolf Waves make great exits too, wish I had more contracts on this one, normally I do, and I could have got out some on these. I was heavily short biased but expecting some pullbacks just didn't think they would get much further than the 1-4 line. Seems like the thread activity has died down some, I feel like the only guy posting lol. Profitseeker or wizlon still around? Thinking I might focus more on a blog or youtube channel or something like that to log my thoughts/trades and help keep me accountable. Anyways, hope you all had a profitable FOMC! I just have to start trading bigger, especially if I'm going to hold some overnight. Take care all and enjoy the waves when you find them!

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Thank you for your posts, Robin. Very interesting, and clear explanations. I like this rule in post 508: "wedgier the better", and this one in Ted's post (507): "No wedge, no Wolfe"

best way to trade this system is to do it yourself without indicator

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Looks like this thread has died. I just stumbled upon Wolfe Waves a few months ago and have come to really enjoy trading them. IMHO, a simple yet powerful method. As member "GnWFx" pointed out in the beginning of this thread, I also like to use the FIB extensions resulting for line 3-4. I find that more often than not, the price reversal takes place at one of these 5 extensions: 113.0, 127.2, 141.4, 161.8, and 200.0. I also use bollinger bands, divergence, and previous S/R as filters for entry. I noticed that no one mentioned the "sweet zone" which I find adds another productive element to this method (especially for WWs that don't exhibit very good symmetry) Hopefully more traders will help to revive this thread. Imho, here is a classic WW on the 4H EG chart Cheers and safe trading to all

Hello Robin and thanks for your posts, anyway your 2 last examples are not wolf waves, they are waves of course and turned out well and may even be a pattern but definitely not wolf wave pattern because of the fourth point that is not within the 2/3 range.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Anyone trading this and making money?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Yes. Wolfe waves make up about 80% of my trades. Here is the latest trade on oil. Volume surge on rejection, divergence, within my projected fib range. Simply sexy and delicious. 30 pips in the green SL moved to BE. Best trading to you, cheers.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Yes I am, I do trade only chart pattern and wolf wave is one of them.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi dude, what makes up the remaining 20% of your trades if you don't mind me asking ?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Mostly contrarian trades based on price action around areas of confluence.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Thanx 2 u both....cause I am studying I am not interested in trading but in doing it automated! The lack of time I can compensate in a high leverage = knowledge in programming.... So if anyone of the trader can create rules for his/her trading(I know sounds easy but many failed believe me!)....we do the ea job.... After this....it will be like:

Hey fx_geezer, Been a while since I visited the thread. That indicator is not really a true indicator it is simply a market internal called the TICK. Measures all stocks trading on an uptick - all stocks trading on down tick. I find it very useful for trading the indices, and another good way to guage momentum. Hope that helps, not sure if there is something similar if you trade a market that is not correlated to ES.

Hey thanks LDFX, I'm not Wolfe student, and I think I see your point, although I think you actually meant 4 did not pull into the 1/2 range right? I really like the Wolfe Wave idea, I think of it more like an ending diagonal, but even there I'm not sure that would fit under Elliot Wave rules. To me it's more about the psychology of what's playing out which is traders either getting themselves too long or too short, and often against the trend of the Higher time frame. So some of my patterns may not follow the exact rigid rules but I will still trade them if I feel the underlying psychology is there. Glad to see you and other's reviving the thread. It's a great pattern or concept to trade with and I still use it in my trading all the time. As for books on Wolf Waves, I'd be interested too if anyone knows. Have you tried reading the sections on ending diagonals from the more popular Elliot Wave books?

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Like Wolf Waves..., what patterns are you looking for ?

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Oh yes, so sorry, how could I make this mistake, believe me I am trading Wolfe waves every day. you are right, I meant the range 1/2, for it to be a wedge and a sign of losing momentum. Yes I do know the ending diagonals of Elliot waves, actually what I think make the wolf wave a powerful pattern is because of 2 things, selling at a top (buying at a bottom) and a confluence of patterns when a wolf wave unfold. Also it is a dangerous pattern if not managed properly because of his counter trend nature.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Here is an example of what I am looking for. Three layers of fibonacci confluence around an area that has served as both support and resistance. If you look at the 5 minute time frame you can see momentum is waning. On these type of trades I am looking for a 15-20 pip bounce so I can move my SL to BE. Usually I will take half of my position off at that point and let the rest free roll to a specific TP

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I see, thanks for your answer, in my case wolf waves are more like 20% of my trading, then mostly M/W pattern and rarely 5-0/ 4th Elliot wave pattern.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
You're welcome. Got a nice 30 pip bounce and out. RBNZ in 15 minutes, best to book the pips

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hey mate! Are you still trading these setups? Do you use any confluence when trading such as other trendlines, s/r zones, fibs etc for justifying an entry? Take care, Krossaren

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I guess the thread is still alive. I know there are some people (including myself) who are still trading WW, but most also trade other methods as well. When I spot one, I trade it. You basically look for wedge shapes and see if a WW fits. If it does, the success rate is very high. Here is one from this morning. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I would like to have point 5 drop below line 1-3, but this is OK Notice the divergence on TDI. Yes confirmation is always nice.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Yes I am very interested, but don't you want any other confluence at all? They are profitable on their own? Had a failed one this afternoon, 15 min EJ... The 5 is a bit too high, but still gave it a go. Went green and then hit sl I also had divergence. Would love to see this thread revived!

--- 帖子 #539 ---
It happens. The only thing That is questionable on this pattern is the double bump on point 2 and yes, point 5 was a bit high. To answer your question. If it is a perfect pattern, then I don't need confirmation. In this case, I would just put it down to a failed imperfect pattern. If any pattern (not just WW) fails, there is an opinion out there that says that immediately trading the failure (reversing) can be quite profitable (in this case about 34pips).

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Im always looking out for Wolfe Waves, if you get them right its a good R/R. Heres 1 I've been watching the last couple days. its getting chopped around now. Trump factor! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

As profitkeeper stated, a bit of a bumpy road, but still valid with potential to trade if you understand the sweet zone. I am assuming you entered to early and got stopped out. The chart below shows your trade. I used the 30 minute TF as it was the only way I could fiddle with the inputs of the ZigZag indicator to show the correct levels (due to the choppiness of the price action). Per my analysis, the entry would have been at 120.14 which is the AB=CD completion and a pip from the 200FIB extension of BC. More confirmation can come from a TDI cross (green crossing red below). A stop loss of 15 pips would be a few pips above the 261FIB, giving the trade a little room to breathe. First target would be the level of X (119.87, very conservative but a good spot to take half off the table and micro manage from there). Smaller time frames with volatile pairs (Yen pairs, EN EA GN, etc) can be tricky, especially for waves that are steeper than the classic set up. Using the FIB extension of BC and the AB=CD level within the confines of the "sweet zone" is critical in these situations. Before price reaches the potential entry point, do 3 things 1) Draw a line from point B that is parallel to line AC to define the sweet zone. 2) Put the FIB extension of BC on the chart 3) Put a horizontal line at the AB=CD completion level Steeper waves angles tend to reverse at the 161 to 200FIB levels with extreme angles all the way to the 261FIB. Imho, the steeper angle waves are harder to trade. Classic waves structurally tend to reverse at the 127, 141, or 161 levels. I find the 141 level to be my bread and butter, which is ironic because I've never seen it mentioned in other WW analysis. Flatter waves tend to end at the 113 or 127 levels. Anyways , hope that helps. When I get time I am going to open a thread myself specifically for Wolfe waves along with some other related waves that I have been studying. I considered trying to revive this thread but thought it may be best to take ownership of a new thread. If anyone is interested, I found this free ZigZag indicator somewhere that shows the pips/candles which is really nice for this strategy. Unfortunately, you can only change the colors by changing it in the code which I have done for a few different colors.

Could you explain the numbers on the ZZ indie. You say it "shows the price/candles" but I don't see the price. I assume the first number is number of pips, but what is the second/third number?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
... Ignored I edited my post. I meant pips and candles. It is hard to see but the first number is the number of pips (with a decimal as well) followed by a slash mark and then the number of candles for that line. It helps tremendously for seeing the ABCD as price is moving. Unfortunately&lt; I haven't figured out hoe to alter the code to get rid of the decimal digit and to make the slash color white for easire viewing. Also, imho, better symmetry = better results. In the trade below (the first one you posted to start the thread) AB = CD in exactly 12 candles for each move. Perfect symmetry (Fib extension and sweet zone extension line also almost perfect) I know it may seem complex but after awhile it's like riding a bike. Just a robotic process of mapping out the wave before it completes with the sole intention of getting the best possible entry and best RR. My point was about "Krossaren96"'s trade. He/she traded a perfectly valid Wolfe wave and lost because of an incorrect entry ( in my opinion of course) As an example, let's look at the first trade you posted on this thread. A winner! But, where do you enter the trade? And even scarier, where does a newbie enter that trade? There is 88 pips between when price initially hits the trend line XB and where the price ultimately stopped and reversed. Bigger time frame of course, but that's a lot of slack to deal with. I mapped it out. The AB =CD completion takes place at 80.51, which lands right on the 161FIB and is a mere 15 pips from ultimate reversal. If one wanted to get in a little bit earlier they could have scaled in starting at the 141FIB and ending at the 161FIB (a 20 pip zone). Point being, entering at the first touch of the trend line leaves you with a 100 pip SL. Scaling in starting at 141 leaves you about 40-50 pips at most. Entering at AB=CD completion leaves you with only 20-25 pip SL, not bad for a move that ultimately was 400 pips!! Anyways, as you said it works for me. Once I locate a WW that has started down CD, I just go ahead and map it. It's very simple. The ZigZag tells you exactly where the completion should be so I just put down that horizontal line in advance. Draw the sweet zone extension line and slap on the Fibo extension and voila, my zone is visually right there in front of me long before price gets there. And you will be amazed at how many times the completion price is exactly on one of the fibo extensions.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Great Expo, Your analysis is much clearer now. You have added a new dimension to WW. I like the fact that you have a heads up as point 4 is approaching 5. Too many people are trying to see a WW even before price reaches point 4.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Thanks brother. I am assuming that most of us haven't paid to take "the course" so stands to reason that there has to be some other layers of thought in trading WWs. I have been fully immersed in studying WW charts for the last 6 months Here is another one as an example. The EUR/AUD daily, playing with fire . The sweet zone is nearly 400 pips until reversal. trading these steep waves is nearly impossible. Where would one enter? Well, to mitigate risk on this one. same thing, look at the zigzag and the completion level. AB = 645 PIPS in 14 candles CD = 664 pips in 15 candles Nearly perfect, and especially needed for these steep, practically untradable WW's. Otherwise, what does one do? Just enter haphazardly somewhere along the 400 falling knife zone? Or just pick a fibo level on the way to ruins? More like the hell zone than the sweet zone. Anyways, safe trading to you. I'll shut up now

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Great setups guys. Regarding my own chart, I traded on the vertical line. Shouldn't we trade once price comes down into the pennant? That way we know the amount of risk? New chart added below. EURJPY 15 min. I think this one is perfect, what about you guys?

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Not the greatest symmetry but a valid wave. Per my analysis, I would have had my predetermined entry level set to scale in from the 141 to the 161 FIB levels. So from 120.38 to 120.44 with a stop loss about 120.60 a shade above the 200FIB. In regards to your entry on the other set up, sure you could wait for re-entry into the broken wedge or pennant but I think that kind of defeats the purpose of the wave. We are trying to get in as close to the reversal point as possible so that our stop is as small as possible. Once you waited (especially on smaller time frame) then your stop loss either has to be much bigger or in your case, not big enough because price had already moved 15 pips in reversal.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Alright, now I know what it should look like. But wouldn't that often result in losing trades resulting from you trading when it is an actual breakout? Trading once price comes back into the channel provides me with a proof that price has at least met some resistance (or support). By the way, news on the euro are coming out in an hour so be careful if trading the EJ pattern. Edit: And you put your stop at the next fiboext? For instance if the sweet zone is at the 1.618 fibo extension then the stop goes a pip or two above the 2.0?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Absolutely it may be a breakout. But even if you wait for price to reverse back into the wedge, it still may just be a retest before the breakout. Only difference is your RR will be reduced significantly, especially on smaller time frames, steeper waves, and more volatile pairs. What if price enters the wedge again and then you enter. Now where is your SL? Inside the sweet zone where you risk being stopped out on routine choppy price action or above the sweet zone in which case your risk is much greater. I just found a potential WW forming here on the GJ hourly. Let's assume price reaches full AB=CD completion at 161FIB, now we wait for price to reverse back to the wedge before entering. That's already 30-40 pips of price reversal. What are we going to do with our SL now? SL of 40 pips back at D? That doesn't make sense to me as we are putting our stop inside the sweet zone. That's why it's called the sweet zone. It's the zone that provides the potential for the biggest gain with the smallest risk. If we enter just before D or scale in at 141FIB our stop only needs to be just above the completion zone to give price some breathing room. Anyways, personal preference for each trader. I am definitely an aggressive person and like the concept of stalking the trade and pouncing on the price as it enters the zone, rather than waiting for price to run away and then go chasing after it. The concept as outlined by the founder or "discoverer" of the Wolfe wave is that the physics of the price action is out of balance and that the sweet zone parameter is where we can capitalize on the best RR. So that's where my soldiers are waiting in advance. Good discussion though and a great way for us to challenge each other and sharpen our WW skills. The TDI crossover can certainly be used as a filter for entry as well. In the EJ 15 minute set up we just discussed, the crossover happened before price re-entered the wedge so you'd get a better RR with some added confirmation.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Terrific information, it all makes sense now. You sure know a lot about WWs! So the stop on the GJ hourly would be at the 200 extension? Really interesting to talk to a pro. I guess you are very profitable? Edit: GBPJPY 15 min chart: The fifth leg seems a bit extreme but all of the other parameters seem to look good, what do you say? Correction: I think I drew my fibonacci wrong? It's supposed to be from leg 3-4, right? So the first picture should be incorrect and the second one correct.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
GBP/CHF hourly, an example what we are talking about. Hind sight of course but a good illustration. Entry option 1: Enter right at initial completion zone with tight SL, price bounces 30 pips, SL moved to BE. Entry option 2: Enter after price reverses and enters the wedge. Do you place a wide SL below D or somewhere inside the sweet zone? Price reverses and touches the D level. If prices continues back through point D then both trades are stopped out. Only difference being option 1 incurs no loss. On the flip side, if price never bounced, option 1 suffers a small loss, option 2 incurs no loss as a trade would never have been entered

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Absolutely, I am on board with what you are saying. Would rather take one or two "false" trades that doesn't come back to the trendline than use 1:3 instead of 1:6 on all the winners! About how many setups of these do you find per day? Edit: I guess you are entering on limit/stop orders? No price action candle confirmation?

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thanks for the compliment and vote of confidence. One of the reasons I want to start a new thread is to challenge myself and others. Also, I think taking ownership and full responsibility for a thread is a great way to learn and to give back. As to your question on the GJ stop loss. There is of course some subjectivity but placing a SL a little above the 200FIB (50 pips or so) would make good RR sense as the potential TP is over 200 pips away. I tend to be very conservative on my TPs and rarely am targeting the full move back to the green target line. On the flip side, if price moved up above the 161FIB, lets say half way to the 200FIB, stands to reason price may make it all the way up to the 200FIB anyways so maybe place a SL half way up from 161. A lot for me has to do with the time frame and the volatility of the pair. GJ on the hourly obviously needs some breathing room so smaller scaled in positions with bigger SLs for sure.

There are many opportunities every day so you never have to force anything. Some pairs are better than others and they all seem to go thru phases where price exhibits good symmetry. Other times the zig zag looks like a gazelle running from a lion in 9 different directions I do look for confirmation in different ways. I admit, I am a Fibo-addict. Previous S/R is considered along with TDI cross. For equities where real total market volume is known, I would expect to see volume spikes near the point of reversal as bulls/bears fight it out. Unfortunately in forex we don't have true known volume. However, I do look at Bill Williams MFI. Bottom line: I feel confident just knowing that I am entering a trade based on a well structured WW with the proper entry point and a prudent SL. Any other filter as confirmation is just icing on the cake. Imho, a WW should be able to stand on its own My daily routine: At the start of each day I only keep charts up from the previous day that still meet the WW criteria and that are still on the final D leg. All of those set ups are already mapped out in advance. Many are longer time frames so I just keep them open and monitor them until the structure becomes invalid or the price reaches my entry zone. The rest of the charts I delete. Then I go thru every pair (or as many as time permits) and quickly scan through all of the time frames. After awhile your mind is trained so the WWs jump off the screen. Any potential set ups on the D leg are mapped out for the day to be monitored.

Starting your own thread would be super! Feel free to send me a message when you do so I don't miss it Great, I am really excited to learn and trade these setups! I am used to use some additional confluence no matter what I trade, so I will most likely not trade them on their own, but we'll see I haven't seen a single trade trigger today, have you? I would love it if you could send charts setting up as that would really help me in learning to spot the setups

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Nice one, but doesn't the 4th wave have to touch the trendline? Not sure though, nice profit Expo, how would you have done on a pattern like this? I'm having a hard time deciding where the sweet zone is. The ABCD doesn't line up with the 2-4 trendline, where is the sweetspot then? or it's a pass?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Technically that is a parallel Wolfe wave as XB is basically horizontal. I find them harder to trade because the sweet zone isn't really as defined as in the classic Wolfe wave. In addition the XB move took place in ONE candle while the CD move took 23 candles so the symmetry isn't there. Tradable, but one that I would likely pass on. As it stands, price stopped dead in it's tracks right at AB=CD completion. If I did trade it, that would be my entry, 161.61 with stop maybe 10 pips above 200FIB depending on my position size and risk You know the saying brother map it out. Anyways, good luck. I have spent the last 6 hours getting everything ready for the new thread, should be up soon

Hi Everyone, Interesting thread...thanks. I put GBUS on strategy tester, with a floor trader pivot indicator (the magenta line is the central pivot). Price tends to test the prior day's pivot, so this may give you an idea of whether price has a chance of hitting the 1-4 line. In the example below, the prior day's pivot is above the 1-4 line and price duly hits it on the way to the pivot. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Here is a WW where the pivots are below the 1-4 line. Price only gets as far as point 4. The location of the pivots could be a useful filter. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Evening all.....

hello Mr ProfitKeeper sorry if i ask a dumb question, i still haven't fully understand how mark and draw the line and the spot. is the #1 mark we must put on the very begining of a trend sir? if so, i think i found one set up on eurusd Attached Image (click to enlarge) (please ignore that buy entry, it was me just messing around with demo acount XD) and then the next one is this sir? Attached Image (click to enlarge) and btw thank you so much for sharing this strategy sir in my opinion it will be very much being a strong, easy, profitable, and adaptive to any market changing condition (can be use for long term) if use with a bit of knowledge of price action trading i think it can capture the exhaustion from a pullback move on a higher time frame, and can be use to capture the exhaustion from a trend also. what i meant by that is, maybe when on a higher time frame (4h for example) is on an uptrend but it's in a pullback move, we can capture the exhaustion of that pullback (it may be a down trend or a consolidation move) on a lower time frame (15m for example). so it may seems like a counter trend trading on a lower time frame but it's actually still trading following the trend from a higher time frame.... well at least for me the higher time frame is always right so far. ps : i'am sorry i have only read your thread up to page 17, it's 4:31 am here, my eye's are killing me XD gonna crash to bed and finish it in the morning, so i'am sorry if my question is already been answered where on page that i haven't read it (or i might got acidentally skiped a word or two reading with my sore eyeball's XD)

Well I hope this thread hasn't died yet. I've been learnings and trading for about 2 and a half years and only 2 months ago did I discover the wolfe wave. Boy is this set up amazing. - It gives really specific zones for managing risk and taking profit, with a high probability of success. It works in every time frame, every forex pair, index, ETF, stock, bond, commodity - you name it.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi ProfitKeeper, As for the bollinger band used, may i know what's your preferred setting on that and also what are the rules used to confirm the wolve wave? Maybe, the high/low of the candle for point D barely touches the upper/lower band or breaches it.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
hey profitkeeper it was a great thread that you started can i connect with you over telegram ?
