Please test this EA, and post results.

Works best on the USDJPY only!!! on a M30 timeframe.

500 PIPS average a week on this one from other sites......forward tested....

It is set with ONE micro LOT, Coders, if we change the LOT size to regular 1.0 do we need to change anything else in the EA?

And is it compatable for InterbankFX?

thanks

--- 帖子 #2 ---
I forgot to mention this is on a "TIMEFILTER".

If someone can comment on how to best setup the TIMEFILTER for InterbankFX platform to coincide with Filtering out the needed timeframe. This EA yields better results with the TIMEFILTER on it.

As per InterbankFX their GMT time is GMT+4 DURING daylight savings time.

The EA show the Start trade at 8 and end at 18, but for GMT+2.

So we need to set at 10 and 20?

Hi Bigballer,

I'm using Firebird v63G. Like it very much (see my statement). I want to use the version you posted here, but when I add it to MT4 it's grayed out. Tried to compile it, but I get this error: '(' - unexpected token.

Could you please post your compiled version?

TIA!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi hendrick,

Please post the one you are using so I can use it also....

And what settings are you using?

thanks

--- 帖子 #5 ---
bigballer, here's the EA.

hendrick,

do you use default settings?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks.

Heres what I use:

extern int MA_length = 10;

extern int MA_timeframe = 0;              // hdb did I add this ? lol

extern int MAtype=0;//0=close, 1=HL

extern double Percent = 0.3;

extern int TradeOnFriday =1; // >0 trades on friday

extern int slip = 100;//exits only

extern double Lots = 1.0;

extern int TakeProfit = 120;

extern int Stoploss = 200;// total loss on all open positions in pips

//extern double TrailingStop = 5;

extern int PipStep = 30;//if position goes this amount of pips against you add another.

extern double IncreasementType =0;//0=just add every PipStep,  >0 =OrdersToal()^x *Pipstep

extern int MagicNumber=10000;

extern bool UseTrailingStop=true;

extern int TrailingStop=15;

extern bool UseHourTrade = True;

extern int  FromHourTrade = 6;

extern int  ToHourTrade = 18;

Do you use default with the 63G ??

What time frame do you use??

thanks

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I don't use this -  was just wondering.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
But what time frame are you using with the 63G EA?

thanks

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I meant to say I don't use either. Just manual trading my own thing.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Then for the account statement you just posted, what was that from??

thanks

--- 帖子 #11 ---
That was hendrick.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Ok Bigballer, here we go.

Please upload the compiled version of your version of Firebird. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
can you describe how the system work?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi Nitman,

Maybe this helps:
http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...-firebird.html

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Click on the error and it will take you to this line:

Inserted Code p=point();

I think that should be
Inserted Code p=point;

point isn't a function but just a double.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Yes, it does well on EURUSD, GBPUSD, and  USDCHF.    The others, it just didn't make any trades.   It had a big loss on one of them.  I'm not sure why.    This one likes to trade over 1 - 3 days.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
See my statement of the first day with this version of Firebird. Although it is profitable it behaves like a madman. Too much selling and buying.

SL is not working!

TP is not working!

This way it could blow your account in just a couple of hours! Please let me know what settings I have to use!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hey Hendrick,

Just curious as to your time frame.  I downloaded your settings but being the MT4 novice that I am - I couldn't figure out the timeframe.

Thanks again,

lonespruce.

Oh - one more thing - did you use the same settings for that statement results on both usdjpy and usdchf?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hey guys,

just wondering if the time settings in the EA are in GMT or simply follow the settings of the MT4 platform into which they are loaded?

Thanks,

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi,

TF=30M. Setting for MA_Timeframe in the EA is 30 also. Settings are the same for all pairs. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
And the second day. I still want some help with my settings. I want this EA to make less trades than it's doing now!!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Why - its making tons of money!

Just curious as to what pairs you are using, because i had this EA open all day and I didn't get a single trade.  Are you using the time contraints therefore only trading at a certain time of day - or are you letting it trade 24 hours?

Are your settings the same as those you previously posted here?

Thanks again,

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Can someone describe how this system works and post a way to do it manually?

Looks great on paper but I don't want to give my account over to a machine... perhaps I'm a bit old school

Also, when I downloaded it it wouldn't work on my MT4, keeps saying "firebird...blah blah... removed". Am I doing something wrong?

Dane

--- 帖子 #24 ---
If you open the EA in metaeditor and read through the script there is a description of the trading rules that you could follow manually.

As far as it not working - open it in metaeditor and hit the "compile" button at the top and then save as whatever you want to call it.

That should make it work - other wise - I don't know how to help as I'm a relative noob with MT4.

Hopefully thats of some help.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
See my statement. Nice work!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi!

All pairs! I just want to see wich pairs are the most profitable with this EA. Settings stiil default.

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Settings still default - so the settings that you uploaded are the ones that were used for those trades?

I've had this EA open for the last three days on a StrategyBuilderFX feed and it has only produced 3 trades.

I hate to be a pain in the ass but...   could you please uploade your settings again, and once again clarify the time frame you are using.

Also - are you closing these trades manually?  Your profits are relatively small per trade as the default target profit is 160pips - or is this simply the trailing stop getting hit?

Thanks again Hendrick and sorry to be such a pain in your ass.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I'm having the same problem.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Installed the EA on my demo account.  Hendrick - How did you not get margin called with all of those trades?  Even at .5 lot x 513 trades, you're well over $7500 in margin.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Ionspruce,

No problem. Here are the settings. As you can see these are different than the ones I posted before. I've tried to adjust the settings in order to decrease the total amount of trades. That didn't worked out so I'm now using the settings which goes with this message. And yes I'm closing trades by hand (that's a lot of work, because there are so many trades to close!).

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi AlphaPip,

First day I saw my margin going down to -750. I don't know why there was no margin call. Maybe they don't do this with demo-accounts?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Seems weird cause those are the same settings I've been using and I'm not getting any trades. I wonder why this is?

I've also started to use the interbankfx demo feed so that its the same as you - to see if i get the same results.

Hopefully I will today.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hendrick,

could you do me a favour and send me a screen shot with a usdjpy chart and the entries generated by this EA - I'm at a loss to figure out why I'm not getting signals.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Charts USDJPY and the open trades (only 2)

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks Hendrick,

Thats really strange because I have not had any trades produced by this EA in the last 2 days.

I noticed that your chart said "Firebird v065tfORIGINAL" - is just the name you saved it under - as mine says "Firebird v065tf" - just want to make sure we have the same ones.

Other than that I can't see why mine is not generating trades.  I do have it set to make live trades - but compared to the high number that you are getting - I'm not getting any.

Does anyone have any ideas?

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
It's the same EA. I only renamed it. I just don't understand why the EA in your case didn't generate the trades. Are there any error-messages under the tab "Journal" or "Experts"?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hey Hendrick do you think you can give me some insight on what this system is, what it does and how to use it, if it is not too much trouble, just checking out your screen shots make this thing look really good and I would be interested in using it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #38 ---
No, there are no error messages at all - I don't understand it myself. What time are your trades in your statement listed - GMT or EST??

I'm at a loss to determine the lack of trades here on my charts.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi,

As I understood the EA is watching for spikes. After every spike there will be a correction (most of the time!) and thats the moment the EA hops in. I found a document that gives some explanation about the EA and the settings. Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I'm living in Europe so it is GMT. Who is your broker for your demo-account? (so I can test a demo with them myself).

--- 帖子 #41 ---
back testing this it preforms really well, double your money fast if you are trading a full lot.  only thing i noticed is when you loose your *really* loose.

on a .1 lot the average loss was 2000$ !!

but then again there isnt many losses , they just save them up for ya

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi Witchazel!

If this one is to wild for you, you should try Firebird version 63G. This one is going slow but steady! In the zip-file you will find my statement, the EA and the settings that I use. Hope you can use it.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Please could someone help me am new to this,, whenever i load the ea i get in experts the following messages:

Loaded succesfully, and immediately

removed

i have expert advisors allowed in green,,

i will appreciate your input

thanks,,

mille

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Close all your charts. Open just one chart (30M) and attach the EA. Have you set MA_Timeframe=30 in your EA?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
After researching abit i think it has less losses then other systems, it just hits you at one time   if you could survive the first 2 trades you would be set.  Think i will start forward testing this one

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thanks Hendrick it is working now

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hey Hendrick,

I noticed that you were using InterbankFX for your test so I did the same as to make sure that I was getting the same feed.

Initially I was using StrategyBuilderFX.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I've tried so many EA's and they all turned out to be loosers. This is the first one thats making me money. And yes, I know that it could turn the other way in the future, but let's wait and see. Hope you will show us your results in the coming weeks. I wish you a lots of success!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi Hendrick,

So after running both of them, which version do you like best?

Thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Scott!

I can't tell you yet! Still testing!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I keep getting these messages when I try to compile this EA.  Anyone have any suggestions?

I found a nice indicator that draws the bands for this EA. It is not part of the EA it is an indicator, so it goes in the indicators folder and not the experts folder...

It just shows what the EA is doing, on the chart.

I set the percent to 0.3 just as the EA is set.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Some functions are not used in the code of this EA. Don't pay attention to these messages. Firebird will work OK.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
New statement Firebirdv065tf!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Can someone pls tell me why the close of the trades are done manually?

and also, would this system work in real life i.e. with a USD 50.000 account trading 0.5 lots?

Anyone tried it live so farr??

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #56 ---
guys i back tested this one from jan 1, 2006 to may 1, 2006....ended up with a loss....wonder how u guys say that u made a profit even with backtesting??

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi,

Backtesting with MT4 is a waste of time. The only way to test an EA in MT4 is to put it on a demo-account and let it run.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Last night (Sunday) when the feed started, I was getting a message in the top left screen, bad hours, what does that mean and how do I fix it? I have the timeframe set at 30.  Thanks in advance for your help...

Roger

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Just started today with a new demo-account with Firebirdv63G and different settings. Is anyone else testing?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Stogie: seen this once during the day on one of the charts. Seems like a bug. If you close the chart, open a new one and reattach the EA it should be working fine (I hope).

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hendrick, could you please post your most recent v65 results?  I've been running it for the last 36 hrs, and it's only executed 2 trades.  This is after running it all last week, and it executed 0 trades.  I'm not sure what's going on.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
My results from Firebird065tf

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Can you please save and upload your settings as well - I'm having the same problem where the EA is not making any trades.

Thanks,

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Also, I do not understand the coding very well, so this is relevant information:

I am testing this EA on a $500 live account trading 0.1 MINI lots.  Could the "extern double Percent" variable or the "Increasement" variable have something to do with why it's not trading?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
upload your settings. Lets have a looky luu.. Scott

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Here's my settings.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Here are the settings that I've been using.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I cannot see why this is not making any trades. Unless your timeframe on your chart is not set to 30 minutes...

Scott

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Whoops - here they actually are.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hold the Phone... A .5 lot size on a $500 account? I don't think so. I think you are getting margin called before you begin...

Your stop size at 200 is $1000 on a $500 account

--- 帖子 #71 ---
LoneSpruce, Do you have a micro Lot account? Otherwise you cannot place a 0.05 lot trade.

Scott

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hey Jones, Im new to this EA stuff.  Do you actually have to have a broker linked to MT4 to run an EA, or can you just do it with like a starting balance of 5,000 from an MT4 demo account?  Or, maybe you can gimme a link to where I can read about accounts in relation to MT4.  Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
If you are asking, Can I auto trade with a demo account of $5000? the answer is yes, through any MT4 enabled Broker. If you are asking, Can I auto trade using an EA with any Broker? The answer is no. They must have MT4 as their platform. I suppose you could take signals from when your MT4 EA places an order and then manually place the same order with any broker. But, then that is not really auto trading. However, it is very mechanical. So, I suppose there is a plus in doing that.

I am no expert in MT4, much less EAs. But that is how I understand it.

Scott

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Thats what I was looking for.  Thanks bud.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Not sure,

But the trades that have been opened have worked just fine.  I think as long as you are in demo mode you can pretty much enter any lot size you want as long as you have enough margin.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Jones - It is .5 MINI lot size on a $500 account.  That's only $25 in margin.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Well, the strangest thing happened this morning.  I have the EA running on a USD/JPY chart, and it actually executed 1 trade, but it's heading in the wrong direction.  Waiting to see if it purchases an additional lot the way it is supposed to.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hmm, I have no ideas then... If you find out please post the answer. thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #79 ---
No, that is how it trades. There is a indicator I posted a little back that will draw the lines to show you what it is doing. A sell is correct, because it trys to trade at extremes. It does not follow the trend. In fact a strong trend will kill it.

Thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Trade is still in progress, but Trailing Stop doesn't appear to be working.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Ya got me. It has reached the end of my knowledge.

Some thoughts about Firebird:

What I like most about Firebird is the concept. Looking for spikes and jump in when there is a correction (most of the time). A lot of spikes are caused by “The News”. That’s the time that most of the EA’s will fail. But not Firebird (again, most of the time)!

Until now I’m testing 2 versions of Firebird: version 63G and 065tf. In contrast to 63G version 065tf is very unpredictable. It can make you a lot of money in short time and of course can blow your account to pieces in an even shorter time. For now I’ve dropped it and will concentrate on version 63G. Version 63G is going nice and easy. Looking at the results of previous tests, about 90% of the trades will end within 1 to 5 days. After these 5 days you can forget about these trades to become profitable. Personally I’ve seen most of the profitable trades will happen within 12 hours. I think it’s a good idea to close all trades at Friday ( at the closing of the market). Better still is to close every trade ( positive or negative) after 12 hours. I’m not a programmer but if there’s any programmer out there that is capable to make these changes to Firebirdv63G, please do!!

Most important setting i.m.o is “Percent”. Too low and it will buy like hell, too high and you will see no trades at all (Percent will affect the distance between the upper and the lower envelope. Put the Firebird indicator to your charts and you will see what I mean) . I’m now using “Percent=0.16” for all the pairs. The following settings seem to work best for these pairs (thanks to previous testers):

EURUSD

MA_length=18

MAtype=0;

Percent=0.15

TradeOnFriday=1;

slip=100;

TakeProfit=30

Stoploss=300;

PipStep=5;

IncreasementType=0.0;

DVLimit = 8

OpeningHour = 6

ClosingHour = 14

GBPUSD

MA_length=18;

MAtype=0;

Percent=0.25;

TradeOnFriday=1;

slip=100;

TakeProfit=30;

Stoploss=100;

PipStep=5;

IncreasementType=0.0;

DVLimit = 8

OpeningHour = 7

ClosingHour = 15

EURCHF

MA_length=18;

MAtype=0;

Percent=0.1;

TradeOnFriday=1;

slip=100;

TakeProfit=10;

Stoploss=300;

PipStep=7;

IncreasementType=0.0;

DVLimit = 6

OpeningHour = 6

ClosingHour = 14

Who is willing to start a fresh demo-account with these settings and keep us informed about the results?? Any comment about Firebird is more than welcome!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
These are in the 30 minute time frame right?

Thanks for all your work here Hendrick.

Scott

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hey Jones!

The TF=30 is hard coded (is that the right word??) in the EA. So the timeframe of your chart don't matter. I prefer the 30M chart because with the Firebird indicator attached to it I can see what happens.

Cheers!!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
For all you guys who want to be informed about economic news (food for Firebird!!) go to: http://www.forexfactory.com/index.php?page=calendar

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hendrick,

first thanks for putting so much effort into this on here and other boards.

Can you confirm that you are using pipstep of only 5 pips.?  Just this is very low compared to anything else I have seen on FB.  If this is the case then great for you doing things out of the box   :-)

WIll see if I can find some time to modify the code as you suggested.

Rgds - L

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi lofie, these are not the settings that Hendrick uses. They are the  settings he has found that others have used. Hendrik's settings are further up the thread. I believe he uses 30 pip step and .16 percent...

Thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I've setup a new demo account with the pairs and perimeters that you posted. I'm using the Firebird V63G magic version.  Lets see how it works.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
That's great Stogie,

I can't wait to see your details...

thanks for doing it... I wonder about the 5 pip step though..

Scott

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi guys!

Please show me some statements! Tomorrow I will post my latest statement for Firebirdv063G. Another thing for tomorrow: watch the results for the "Non Farm Payrolls" figures. This will make a lot of spikes (I hope)! Until now the best pairs to trade (I think) are: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF and EURCAD. EURAUD and AUDUSD are losers!. If I have the time I will study next week every trade that was made to determine the right settings. If you discovered profitable settings please post them! Keep on trying guys!!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I am running three pairs with the above settings posted by Hendrick.  Looks good so far, we'll see...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi!

I've been following this thread closely.  So far, the Firebird has done two trades for me with the gbp/chf, and was successful on both.  I have set up the three pairs as well, but have not had any trades trigger yet.   Hendrick, and everybody else, thanks for all your help with firebird.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hey guys, can you explain why exactly there is a time restriction implemented on this EA?  Is this considered the optimal time for this method?  Hendrick, are you using the time restriction?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
At 14.30 (GMT +2) I was sitting in front of my screen watching the EURUSD-chart and waiting for the outcome of the " Nonfarm Employment Change" figures. At 14.32 the price went up like a rocket. Half an hour later my free margin went into the minus (and my broker would have closed all my trades if I had a live account) and Equity dropped from 6.300 to 1.700. Ouch!

On the other hand my second Firebird-account was still easy going as if there was no News at all. The difference: both are version 63G, but for the first one I used MAtype=1 and for the second MAType=0. According to the code a value of 0 would results in more trades and 1 in lesser but safer trades. Based on my tests it’s just the other way round: MAtype=0 lesser but safer trades and MAtype=1 more trades.

I think it's very important to test (forward testing and not back testing!) the same EA with different settings at the same time. It’s the only way to find out how an EA will react upon such a thing as “The News”. So next week I will continue testing Firebirdv63G with different settings and of course with MAtype=0. The next most important setting imho is Percent. This value will modify the distance between the upper and lower envelope. Let’s see what we can do with this setting

I will open 3 demo-acoounts with the following settings (all pairs):

TEST1  TEST2  TEST3

MA_length=10

MA_timeframe=30

MAtype=0

Percent=0.12  Percent=0.24  Percent=0.12

TradeOnFriday=1

slip=100

Lots=0.5

TakeProfit=26

Stoploss=300

Fast_Period=23

Fast_Price=1

Slow_Period=84

Slow_Price=1

DivergenceLimit=0.002

Use_V63D_Divergence=1   Use_V63D_Divergence=0

PipStep=30

IncreasementType=0

DVLimit=10

PipsGoal=500

PipsLoss=500

GMT=2

DST=0

OpeningHour=0

ClosingHour=23

writelog=0

--- 帖子 #95 ---
See my latest statement of Firebird63G with MAtype=0.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hendrick, So are you going to continue to keep the three you said were not very good? I saw them in your statement.

Also, you are just using the 63g version the is posted above and the settings you already posted right? One last thing, are you still manually closing trades? or just closing after the 12 hour limit you talked about? thanks scott

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi Scott!,

I'm still trying to find the most profitable settings for v63G. I've now closed all my accounts and will start with 3 new demo accounts with the settings as mentioned in my previous posts (and of course MAtype=0). I will not close trades manually.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Am I correct in Firebird v63G that no matter what you setup in the inputs for Percent, TradeOnfriday, slip, PipStep, IncreasementType, DVLimit, OpeningHour and ClosingHour, it gets overwritten by the "case" statements within the programme for EUR/USD, GBP/USD, EUR/CHF?

Where can I find more information on using this "case" function and within this programme, how is the "case" number generated?

Thanks in advance,

Hi,

i am using firebird63....on the eur/usd, gbp/usd and eur/chf charts i am getting bad hours (which stogie got sometime back)....i am not getting this message on the other charts.....i tried reloading the chart and the EA but still the problem persists...can anyone help pls??

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Good spot.  Comment out the call to the "SetupGlobalVariables();"  near the beginning of the "Start()" function .    (insert a double forward slash at the start of the line i.e. "//" )

[ any how this should be called in init() function unless MT4 is really brain dead, oh how I miss the C++  "const" definition  ;-).]

You might want to consider commenting out the "Logwrite()" line just above as well as this logs all the bid's for each tick somewhere.!!!

- L

--- 帖子 #101 ---
eur/usd, gbp/usd and eur/chf "Bad Hours" are set in the programme under the "switch(MagicNumber) {" functon. You will see "case" inputs with settings for these 3 currency pairs. The rest of the charts are set using the inputs for OpeningHour and ClosingHour set at the beginning of the programme or by manual settings using Property "Inputs". The "Bad Hours" comment is active when the current time is not between these settings. I don't believe it effects trading activity. It is just a comment to indicate when trading time might be bad.

wackena

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Thanks for the response.

Does the "void SetupGlobalVariables()" function do the same as Comment out? And, with the "extern int writelog = 0;", does this stop all writelog functons?

Wackena

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Wackena - can see your logical thinking, but all the "void" says is the function  call returns a data value which is of type "void". Or put it another way, it is saying that this function returns nothing.

It is explained much better here....

http://forum.mql4.com/3332

see chapter 7 for the functions.

You are spot on with the logwrite flag.

That is strange, I booked 92 pips today with 63g..

Scott

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hey Scott,

Are you letting 63g close its own trades or are you closing them manually?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I am letting it close by itself. I used Hendrick original settings listed here with the 63g model, not the 65 I think that one is insane...

I only traded the USDCHF GBPUSD EURUSD

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks a lot Scott,

Appreciate it - seems like their so much confusion with this EA - the concise answer was a nice change!

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I've been running the 63G for over a week with the alternate settings and haven't had a trade.  SMJ, is that the first trade off of this EA for you?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Today was the first day this week I have had a chance to look at it. so it is the first day I turned it on with the settings listed in my post above.

Ps, I noticed if you have set the ma type to 0 it very seldom makes a trade.

Hi All

I started to forward test Firebird 065tf on 28 May 2006 with a 10.000$ demo account. I used only default settings with one currency pair USD/JPY, as you can see in my statment result are amazing !! +2398$ in about 1 week without any loss (13 consecutive wins).

Question for you : what indicators have I add to MT to be able to see when EA start to buy or sell ?

I will continue to post in this thread about my forward test result with this EA.

see you

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Here is the indicator, just match the percent to your settings.

Could you post your setting and timeframe and currency pairs traded? thanks scott

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Thanks Scott for indicator

TimeFrame used is M30 , only on USD/JPY as you can see in detailed statment. Settings are in attachment, you can import inside EA (however as I  said in my previous post these are default settings i didn't change anything)

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Yea, I have just forgotten what the defaults were it's been so long ago..LOL thanks scott

--- 帖子 #118 ---
so i finally got this thing trading -v63- and booked 202pips this morning!  not too bad.  only trading on the pairs mentioned by scott.

is anyone else still testing?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
For last 3 days, I have been testing Firebird v63g on 4 charts eur/usd, gbp/usd, usd/jpy & usd/chf with the attached setting files. In the 1st settings file ,I dropped the Percent down to 0.05 on M1 chart. It has produced consecutive win runs of 54, 58 & 72 before a loss trade. The problem is with wide price shifts. The 1st set of settinggs can produce as many as 14 open trades on 1 chart and with a big change in price in the wrong way can result in a hugh loss that eliminates any gains. I modifed the settings to the 2nd settings file and so far the number of open orders has decreased, with average 3 to 7 total open trades, and, since yesterday at 18:00 GMT, I have had 38 consecutive wins and no losers. It also survived the 12:30 GMT price swing this today.

As stated many times on this thread, Firebird can make money, but it can also lose money if not watched carefully.1st set

Wackena

--- 帖子 #120 ---
So just to clarify - all trades were on M1 and you let it close its own trades?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Okay - I just looked at the settings and the 1st has a time frame of 30, while the second has a timeframe of 15.  This would indicate that trades were based on these timeframes not the 1M chart.

Secondly for everyone - MAtype in both cases was 0.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Could you please post a statement of your trades.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Attached is DetailedStatement. First 2 trades were manually closed from old settings to start 2nd set.

I have tried to use the Firebird Indicator, but when I try to apply it to

a chart nothing happens.  I downloaded it to my MT4 indicator list with no

problems. The box will even come up for me to

change settings, but the indicator will not load onto the chart.  Can Firebird

be traded as an indicator & not the EA?  Thanks for any help.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
You could put it on a chart, and just disable live trading or have it ask for manual confirmation.  That way you could decided to enter a trade when a signal is given, or just to sit back and watch.

Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I always backtest my strategies and only then do the forward tests. On backtests you can see under what circumstances your strategy works and when not and also catch some bugs.

I don't support curve-fitting but a general backtest is recommended for all methods and systems before going live. 1-2 month forward test won't show you much (max drawdown, profit/loss, average consecutive wins and loses).

its better to do both kinds of tests and even more. read this: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...2&postcount=44

thats my humble opinion.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Thanks for that reply.  I am still unable to get the indicator

to appear on the chart.  Any idea what I did wrong?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
could you post a screen shot? thanks

--- 帖子 #132 ---
If I do post one it will only show the chart as nothing

of the Firebird Indicator will show on the chart.

Would it help if I still post one?  Thanks for your

help.

Does your chart have a smiley face in the right hand corner, or a frown face, or a X?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
It has none of those.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Ok. I will list the steps and you can see if yours are correct.

1. close MT4

2. right click on start button left corner. left click on explore.

3. Scroll down until you find program files and click on the + sign.

4. scroll down until you find your broker MT4 folder and click on the + sign

5. here in the experts folder is where you place the firebird EA. (not in the indicator folder)

6. Start your MT4 program back up.

7. Make sure you Navigator window is open on the left side, below the currency prices.

8. scroll thru the navagtor until you find the firebird EA.

9. Drag that EA into your chart window.

10. Right click in your chart window and select Expert Advisors and then select properties.

10. this will bring up the menu of settings.

11. You can adjust the settings to any that you have found in this thread or use your own.

12. select the common tab and make sure the Allow Live Trading is selected

13. press ok.

14. go to the top of the program and make sure that the menu tab for Expert Advisors shows a green arrow and not a red x. if the red x is present, just press the tab and it will go green.

15. You should now have a smiley face in the right hand corner of your screen.

Please ignore the steps you already know. I have no idea what your level is...

hope this helps...

--- 帖子 #136 ---
That is the problem.  I had put it in the indicator file.  What I

could be traded manually?  Thanks for your help.

Hello,

Did anybody programmed this firebird system in VT trader?

I would like to try it out but,i am not a programmer,so if anybody did or have intentions to do it please let me know.

Thanks,by

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Wackena,

I never saw the response to the timeframe question.  Your MA timeframe settings are 15 and 30.  So are you trading on 15 and 30 or do just use those settings on the M1 chart?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
On fb63 it does not matter what timeframe you have your chart set to. When you enter the time into the settings menu, that becomes hard coded and the EA does not look at the chart time. That was how this was explained earlier in the thread. So his saying he is on m1 has no meaning. just use the settings he has in the document he posted.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
So you're saying use those settings, but place it on an m1 chart?

Another question then.  His setting for "use v63D divergence" is 0.  My only choices are true or false?  What does 0 equal?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Place your chart on what ever time frame you want. I would place mine on the same as the setting. It makes no difference to the EA In programming,

a 1 = True   a 0 = False.

I suppose that he uses the M1 on the chart, so he can see fine detail. the EA does not care...

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Earlier in the thread someone posted a inidcator that basically shows what Firebird is doing.  That indicator has two settings that need to be matched to the underlying EA.  My question is, the MA Period input on the indicator refers to the MA length or MA timeframe on the EA?  Thx.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
No logic for it, but TF=15 and I keep chart on M1.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #145 ---
The indicator uses the time frame that is set in the charting program. So if you are using the indicator, I would place the EA at 15 and the chart at 15 and the indcator menu at 10

As the indicator only sets the period of the Ma not the time frame and also the percent. Which should be the same as the EA

hope that helps,, thanks scott

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I believe this is the indicator your referring to.

Hi,

i have loaded the firebird65 with default settings on to the usdjpy chart...but i get non-trading hours throughout the day...pls lemme know what i can do...i use default settings only.....

--- 帖子 #148 ---
To turn off this comment, set StartingHour=0 and ClosingHour=24. Also, see Post 100 to turn off other hour settings in the programme.

The "bad hours" is only a comment and does not effect trading.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #149 ---
It seems to affect my EA - I'm getting this comment on 2 charts out of 4.  On those two the price is clearly outside of the envelope but there are no trades.  On the othe pairs strades have been initiated.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
In Firebird v63g there is  Comment=(" maxOrdersOpen = ",max00). The output on the charts were never correct. I changed this to Comment=(" maxOrdersOpen = ",OrdersTotal()). The result is that it appears on all charts with total orders for all active currency pairs. What do I need to do to make it Currency Pair specific?

Thanks in advance,

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hey Guys,

Something crossed my mind today.  Since firebird is really killed during news, and doesn't make any trades when the market is really quiet - why not have 2 or three different "levels" of settings.

What I have started to do is to reduce the percentage during the asian session as well as the take profit levels.  I think you get the idea.

It's still a work in progress but I thought that you guys might like to try this approach to avoid getting killed by the news.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I have Firebird v63g with tf=15. When backtested on M1 period, I get very good results. When backtested at period M15, I get very poor results. Is there something in the strategy tester that allows period selection to override or at least effect test results. If this is is happening in strategy tester, does it also happen in forward testing or Live.

Or, could it be that TF=15 is specified within the programme, but not correctly implemented as the programme runs.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Have you been forward testing on15M? The reason I ask, is in back testing on 15m there is no detail taken as to when within a 15m time segment price was.

So, in a 1m time frame in back testing there is more detail. As would be the case when you are forward testing in demo mode, regardless of the time frame selected for the chart, because the data is live. In fact, in live demo testing, if this idea is correct, it should produce better results than a backtest in any time mode.

What do you think?  Scott

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi everyone,

I will be gone for a couple of weeks on vacation.  I look forward to returning to this great thread.  There are a lot of great minds here.

Lonespruce, I agree.  Firebird gets killed during volatile times.  Lately, I've been shutting down Firebird before volatile news events.  Anything marked by the red icon on ForexFactory's calendar, and Firebird gets shut down.  Last night, (I'm Central time zone), Firebird had 20 successful trades for 200 pips total.

See you all when we get back..

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Scott,

No foward testing on M15. Only backtesting. I've started at forward testing  Demo this AM on M15 chart. I will compare results with Live account that is on M!. I've been using the MetaTrader platform for only 2 months. I will have to gain expereince as I go. But it does appear that there are better results, overall, in forward testing then backtesting.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hey Guys,

Here is whats been up for the last couple days.  Some trades here were manually opened, some manually closed, most opened and closed by firebird.

This is how I would trade this EA if I were to take it live, what I mean to say is that I would have some manual trades as well.

Just trying to show that with some manual tweaking - this can be a good EA.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
This is only a short term observation. Yesterday, I started another Demo to run side-by-side with may existing Live acct. Both have same settings on eur/usd, gbp/usd, usd/jpy & usd/chf charts. My Live account already had 5 open trades when i started the Demo. Overnight, the Live acct had 4 closed trades (all winners) and Demo had 9 closed trades (all winners). My Live acct was most of the time involved in averaging existing trades with more PipStep trades, while my Demo did not have any PipStep trades overnight.

lonespruce's comments on manually working trades, when needed, may allow EA to generate improved profits. Whether this is true, most likely would depend on current market activity level.

Just some observation and thoughts.

I still think Firebirdv63G is one of the greatest EA's ever made. We had some heavy spikes this week caused by the "The News" but it looks like this version of Firebird is not very vulnerable for these spikes. Still I think it will be better to close Firebird just before and after the Big News. I'm now working on a tool with wich you can specify stop and start times for Firebird for a whole week. You can use it to prevent Firebird to take trades at certain times or to prevent to take trades during The News. Very cool! If I have the time I will post it this weekend.

Until now I think TF=15 and Percent=0.05 is the best (Thanks Wackena!!). And for the settings: MAtype=0 is a must, don't use MAtype=1. And much better results with Use_V63D_Divergence=false. Hope all you guys will keep on testing this powerful EA!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hendrick,

Thanks. this is good information. I agree with your settings, except a higher stoploss and pipstep seems to be somewhat tolerate of spikes. I am using stopless=120 and pipstep=40. The reason is that I feel the 120 sl allows larger spikes and pipstep=40 will not open too many orders that could hurt with a severe spike. I've left the MetaTrader on 24 hrs/day. On these settings, from market start on Sunday June 11, I have had 69 completed trades with 66 winners and 3 losers. My brother wants to turn off the trader from 0800-1000 EST. so I modified the EA as follows.

if ( Hour()<OpeningHour+GMT+DST || Hour()>ClosingHour+GMT+DST) return(0); else { // included by Renato

All I did was to reverse the >< and replaced the "comments="bad hours"" with return(0). So when OpeningHour=12 and ClosingHour=14 GMT, this will stop trading from 0800-1000 EST. If you desgin a weekly schedule to set trading times for a complete week, that would be great.

On my wish list is to have someone programme this EA to set Lot Size with a calculation based on a percentage of AccountEquity. This would allow the EA to adjust to bigger or smaller lot size according to the profit or loss of the EA. If equity goes up, lot size increases proportionally amd risking only a fixed percent of equity. Also to have the ability to set max open orders per pair to limit exposure during severe spikes.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Good work guys!

I'm glad to see the EA getting even better.  Just curious to know why you don't want it to trade during news?  I've had some of my best trades here on the retracements.   Maybe I've just been lucky?

Anyhow - the weekly timer would be great for trading times, and huge announcements such as NFP etc.

I haven't changed the actual code any but I've been playing with the settings a bit - here is what I find works best for me.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hey Lonespruce, what percentage of winning trades do you have? And what kind of pippage do you get per week? I guess the others using this EA can share their experiences here as well. I am considering giving it a whirl on a demo account.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
G'day,

I am also testing this EA.  I am not all that sure about how it actually works.  I am still looking into it.

One thing I have noticed is that I haven't had any trades on USD/JPY.  I am using the same settings on all at the moment.  I am not sure why  I haven't had any trades  on the Yen.  I will need to do a bit more research.

One thing I really like about this strategy is the way it fades breakouts.  I have been searching for a decent  objective method  to time  these  trades.  Firebird seems to be doing a great job.

I'm having trouble with position size as  I am not sure what my max risk is per trade.

I hope I can make a useful contribution in future.

Hi All,

I started testing this EA on a Live account with $150, trading micro lots ($5 margins) this week using Hendrick's settings from yesterday. I'm only testing the EUR/USD as of now to see if the results are similar to everyone's demo accounts. Took a big 42 pip loss yesterday, but back-to-back winners since.

I'll keep everyone posted, if you like.

*Edit* Can someone explain how to modify the "MaxDrawDown" & "MaxOrdersOpen"?

I am currently short USD/CHF from 2294.  So I'm currently down about 30 pips.  I am using hendrick's 15 settings. Pipstep is 15 but I still only have 1 open position.  I assume i should now have 3 short positions.  Correct?

Wackena, thanks for sharing. Those are some good numbers!

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Wackena, for the losers do you lose 120 pips each on those since your SL is 120 pips?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
It would seem that the object of 63g is a type of regression to the mean. This being the case if one were to figure out the range of price from the mean for each pair, one could have a better idea at what level to place the stop pips.

It also should be noted this stop is not really a stop loss. It is a catastrophic stop. . because this system is a regression system it operates essentially without a stop... It works on the idea of producing several wins to one loss and it uses loss cost averaging to achieve this in a strongly trending market.

Yes. eur/usd, gbp/usd & usd/chf, 1 pip =0.0001 and usd/jpy 1 pip = 0.01.

Hey Guys,

I've been involved in a very interesting discussion with a knowledgeable trader who has made me think a bit more about Firebird, how it works, and what we could do to improve it.

I'm not a programmer, but I'm willing to provide an idea if someone is willing to make it work - assuming you think its a good idea

First off -  here are two links that made me think about the fatal flaw of Firebird and how we can actually make it work to our advantage.

http://www.investopedia.com/univers...fiveminute6.asp

http://www.investopedia.com/univers...fiveminute7.asp

Have a look at those and then let me know what you think - I'm kind of hoping someone will have the same idea I've had - and that I won't have to try and convince you of its merit.

Hopefully I'm not simply out to lunch on this one.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
All - Do you let this system trade regardless of direction?  Reason I ask, is because on my live chart (Micro) I have one short and one long position.  Should I let it hedge, or close both?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi all, could anybody give me a hint on what the Current Divergence measures for? It seems that sometimes if the divergence is larger than the limit we set, the EA will not open trades even the price reaches out of the envelope area. Is this some kind of filter to avoid the trending market?

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hey Alpha,

I'm not sure what the other guys do - but I'm beggining to use a bit of discression with this EA in that I'll put on bigger positions manually once I see that the price has actually reversed, as well as closing out positions that seem way to far away from the current price to come back in the next 12 hours.

Now - as far as your question - I guess if you want an EA that you can use to make your computer into a money making machine with no intervention - just let it do its thing.  I personnaly would close the position with the lowest probability unless you are trading a really narrow range that is up and down really fast, in which both positions would have a good chance of hitting their target price.

hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hey rongshihong,

check out the file earlier in this thread here:

http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...4&postcount=39

It may be able to answer your questions about what the Current Divergence measures for.  As far as the EA not opening trades - first make sure you have everything set up properly - then adjust it until you find the sweet spot.

Many of us have posted settings that do produce trades - so duplicate those and then sit and wait.  Also make sure you have the EA attached and not just the indicator.  I don't mean to offend but I know some other people had that problem.

Thats about all I can think of - as far as it not making trades when it looks like it should - I have noticed this as well and I think that the indicator is slightly different from the EA.  But I'm not sure.

hope this helps a bit.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thank you lonespruce. That document is very helpful and gives me useful information to better understand this method. However I am still not able to find anything related to the "Current Divergence" in that document.

The reason why I ask is that I notice that there's a parameter in the EA named "divergencelimit" and I think this is why sometimes the EA is not opening trades even if the price breaches out of the envelope. What I noticed is that if the Current Divergence is bigger than the "Divergencelimit", the EA will not execute trades. Not sure if this is true or not.

By the way, I started running this EA since yesterday using Hendrick's latest settings and so far got some nice trades(8 winners and 1 loser). I am also thinking if it is better to have difference percentage for different pairs because their volativities are different. I am going to try more about this EA later using a bigger percentage and stop loss for the pair GBP/USD and GBP/JPY and I think there's a lot of potential in this method. It might not be the holy grail but would probably be a good grail.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hey rongshihong,

No problem.  This might help.  Once you have the EA attached to a chart press F7 to get the EA properties to come up =- then change "USE_V63D_DIVERGENCE" to "false".

That should end your divergence problems.

What you said about different pairs and their volatility is also an interesting idea, one that I have been thinking about and I agree with you.  It is much like the different risk models that are used in the various Vegas documents for each of the different pairs.

Let me know if you have any luck with this - and I'll do the same.

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Most opinions that I have heard state that it doesn't matter which Chart period you select, because the time frame is hardcoded into the EA. I started 3 side-by-side tests to compare using the same settings, but different Chart periods. Just to note, that I used 2 forward test Demos and 1 Live account for this test. Here are the results from June 14 (start at 1800 GMT) to June 16 (end at 2400 GMT).

M1 (Live)

eur/usd - 10 trades (10 wins, 0 loss)

gbp/usd - 19 trades (18 wins, 1 loss)

usd/chf - 15 trades (14 wins, 1 loss)

usd/jpy - 6 trades (5 wins, 1 loss)

M15 (Demo)

eur/usd - 14 trades (14 wins, 0 loss)

gbp/usd - 4 trades (4 wins, 0 loss)

usd/chf - 5 trades (5 wins, 0 loss)

usd/jpy - 5 trades (5 wins, 0 loss)

M30 (Demo)

eur/usd - 1 trades (1 wins, 0 loss)

gbp/usd - 10 trades (10 wins, 0 loss)

usd/chf - 3 trades (3 wins, 0l oss)

usd/jpy - 2 trades (2 wins, 0 loss)

If there is supposedly no difference between Live and Demo resuts, there seems to be a significant difference in trading activity. Also, it seems M15 and M30 periods, traded less times and "maybe" handles trending spikes better. I say "maybe", because this is suxh a short test period. Also, there are some indications here that different currency pairs may perform better on different Chart periods.

If I am understanding the Firebird v63g code, the first original trade on a chart is triggered by the "Relative Vigor index" by the Code,

double RVI=iRVI(NULL,0,10,MODE_MAIN,0)-iRVI(NULL,0,10,MODE_MAIN,1);

In the orignial 1st trade, the TimeFrame variable is 0. This means it uses the current Chart TimeFrame selection.

The PipStep trades are triggered by "Moving Average index" by the Code,

double myMA =iMA(NULL,MA_timeframe,MA_length,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_OPEN,0);

In the PipStep trades, MA_timeframe is used and in my settings, I am using MA_timeframe=15.

This is why I get different results for different Chart Periods as reported previously.

The bottom line is that; "Cuurent Chart TimeFrame selection will effect trade activity".

I hope this makes since. If I'm wrong, please advise.

For the first time I will test my new tool "EDEA" (Enable Disable Expert Advisor) for the coming week.

EDEA is made with Macro Scheduler (8.0.3) and is free to use. With EDEA you can trigger the “Expert Advisors” button (enable and disable) in MT4 in order to prevent the EA to be active during certain times of the day (for example, don’t trade between 11.00 pm and 8.00 pm or don’t trade during News events etc.). You can use four stop and start times a day. EDEA is using an ini file in which you can give stop and start times for a whole week.

I know that some EA’s have the possibility to do the same, but not all. As I’m not a MQL-programmer I made this tool so it can be used for all EA’s.

If you want to test it please PM me.

Special to Wackena: I really appreciate your contribution to this thread. Great job! Regards, Hendrick

hi guys,

does anybody have a version of Firebird written in wealthScript or EasyLanguage? Because I think MT's backtesting capabilities really suck.

Thank you!

hi Folks,

I wish i could answer some of the questions posted above but I don;t have much experience with EA's and programming.

I am having problems with the EA.  it does not seem to be placing trades as expected.  i have just had 4 losses at 42 pips - perhaps my stop loss is too tight.  I will try 120pips as suggested by wackena.  The other problem is that i have set the pip step to 15 but it is not opening any extra trades.  I assume you enter these setting in the dialog box that opens when you select "expert advisors - properties".

i can't work out why I am not getting trades as expected.  they do not seem to be following the settings I entered.  Any advice would be appreciated.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Thanks for the info.  i am not having much success with the 42 pip stop, but as i mentioned in a previous post my trades are not following the settings.  When i add the EA i enter the setting in the info dialog that pops up.  is that the correct place or do I need to edit the code?

Also, which broker are you using?

Thanks, Wiz.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Either way to enter settings will work.

My Live Account is with InterbankFX.

i am really beginning to wonder about the long term viability of this aproach.  If a pair has a sustained breakout then the losses will very quickly swallow up our profits.

Personally i think a better approach would be to use this strategy with some kind of trend filter and only buy short term countertrend spikes in uptrends etc.   I am still running the EA on a few demo accounts with different settings to see how it performs overall.  i am particularly interested in the drawdowns as they should be pretty big.

I guess i am uncomfortable adding to losing positions, as it is one of those fundamental "no nos".  Then again we need to be thinking outside the box.

I am still having a hard time with the code and trying to determine how this strategy is supposed to work.  i thought the idea was to buy/sell spikes outside a MA channel, but i am not sure if that is what it is doing.

Just expressing my concerns.  There may be some validity to the underlying concept upon which this strategy is based.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Wiz,

I have the same concerns. When I got hurt on earlier testing of Firebird v63g with different settings, it was severe trends that cause high loses. So far with these last settings, that I'm using now for last 2 weeks, this has not happened. It could be just a matter of time until a market trending situation can make this happen again.

Someone should modify this code to include a "MaxOrdersPerChart" variable to limit the number of open orders, for a currency pair, that can be opened in a severe trending market. The "IncreasementType" varible could be used to increase PipStep amounts, so the EA will increase PipStep, between trades, to limit number of orders in a trending market. My concern with using the "IncreasementType" varible, is that it may cause some orders from opening in a slight to moderate trending situation. where most of the winning trades are made.

All - I've been testing Firebird with Hendrick's settings on a Live Micro account for 3 days.  I've only been running it on the EUR/USD chart.  To-date it's executed 7 trades - 6 winners.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
How many pips was the one loss?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hendrick's settings have a 42 pip S/L and 18 pip T/P. The loss was 42 pips. I will admit that these settings are very concerning. For every loss, you must follow with 3 wins to recover those losses. Scary stuff, but I'm following Hendrick's settings to a "T" and it's producing, so far.

*FYI* Just produced another win.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Thanks for the info.

Would the loss have turned into a winner if you had a larger stop loss, 100+ pip, or would you have just lost more?  I am trying to compare 3 different suggestions for SL size.

I'm only using the EA on USD/CHF. During the last 7 days I've had only winners. 12 so far but 2 open trades that are negative, one by -90 pips.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Yes, I was short at 1.2620 with S/L of 1.2662. The market reached 1.2670 before retracing. A >52pip S/L would have been in profit.

NVWINE - What are your settings?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Good call Lonespruce - Both trades closed in profit.  Thanks for the advice.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thanks Alphapip.

I've read on other posts that if you change your MAtype to 0 instead of 1, it will eliminate the entries on spikes.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Entries on spikes = quick money with Firebird.  Price moves outsid the envelope to trigger trades - then comes back very fast triggering profit.

Sounds like a good thing to me.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hendrick's quote from another site:

"Furthermore I think MAtype=0 is a must. With MAtype=1 I've seen Firebird placing trades during a spike. Another spike in the same direction and your account is zero (happened twice to me)."

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Okay - well you'll have to test and see what you like best

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Is that what this EA is actually doing.  i am running the EA on a 15 min chart with matching MA envelope, but the signals it gives do not match.  I am not sure why as I do not as yet understand the code.

So far my results are great using hendrick's 15 min settings - ie. TP 18, SL 42.  The worst performer has been USD/CHF and GBP/USD the best.  It's still early days though.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Wiz - On another forum, I noticed that Hendrick has changed his settings from 18/42 to 26/52.  I've been trading it for the last 24 hrs on USD/CHF and EUR/USD = 3 wins, 0 losses.

I'm a little more comfortable trading these settings, because you only need 2 wins to recover a loss, as opposed to 2.33 wins to recover a loss with his previous settings.

A little update about my forward test started on 28 May 2006 based on Firebird 065tf with default settings (TF 30 min , pair USD/JPY) , actually +366 pips gain with only 2 consecutive losses (27 total trades).

Alphapip can you please post your complete settings here...the new one with the new SL and TP?

Here ya go!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Please feel free to test EDEA (Enable, Disable, Expert, Advisor). With EDEA you can make a schedule for a whole week with which you can enable and disable the EA in MT4. Suppose you don't want your EA place trades between 11:00 PM and 8:00 AM or you want to disable the EA just before an important News Event and hop in 1 hour later. You can do that with EDEA.

For Firebird I think it is better to disable it between 11:00 PM and 8:00 AM (GMT+2). I've added 2 more periods for myself: disable Firebird between 12:00 AM- 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM-4:00 PM. The very best time to trade is between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM. A lot of winning trades and no losers at all.

Please give me some feedback on EDEA.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Thanks Alphapip. Do you trade in all time frames?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Keep up the great work Hendrick

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hey everyone. This might seem like a silly question, but how does one convert the text settings into a .mq4 EA file?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Nope.  Just the M15 on the EURO and Swissy.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
You don't convert the .txt into an .mq4.  Save the text file to your "experts/presets" folder, and rename the file extension from .txt to .set.  Open a new chart and attach the EA, when it prompts you to confirm your properties, click the "Load" button, and browse to the .set file.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
24 hours per day? sorry for all the questions.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
The importance of time! (BTW these are the times trades were opened, not closed)

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Yep.  24hrs.  But take a look at Hendrick's doc.  It appears that by eliminating 3 specific hours a day, you greatly improve your profits.  Something to think about.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Thanks again. I got it all setup in the demo account now.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
if your broker allows hedging maybe run firebird and ema_cross at same time
http://www.forex-tsd.com/ema-cross/925-ema-cross.html

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I setup the EA on all the charts Hendricks listed like 8 hours ago (3 Pm EST) and no trade has been executed. Is this normal or am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Give it a bit more time.  When i first started it took a while for my first trade to trigger.  As long as you see the smilies on the charts then everything should be working.  I have had a few trades today but not recently.  2 losses actually but after about 20 winners who's complaining.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Thanks, I'll take a look at that EA.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I have only had a few losses so far with the 18, 42 settings.  i will give the new ones a go on another account to compare.  I want to run these for a t least a month to get a feel for how it handles big moves.  if it survives without too much tweaking then we may be on to something.  it's been great since last week but then the markets haven't moved much.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I could be 100% wrong as I have not tested the 15M settings - but if you are using the 15M settings - I would forget using this EA during news or "big moves".

I think that this is were you will get killed with run away positions.  Again - I have not tested the EA like this so - do your own forward test.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
You may be right there.  So far though the biggest losses occurred at the start of the week not long after the open.  I got 5 losses in a row but easily made up for it by the end of the day.

The problem with news releases is that you never know which ones will move the market most.  As Hendrick points out it may be best just to avoid certain times altogether.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Please test this new version of EDEA. Make you own weekly schedule (can also be used to step out before News Events).

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Doh!!! Four losses so far today.  Those losses add up fast.  Ie. 42pips.  I may be better off with a larger SL.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I do not see any smilies on my chart. All I see is the label Firebird v63G with an X beside it.

Same here.  I got killed in the Asain and UK sessions.  1 loss closed, with 5 losing positions still open..... OUCH!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
What happened? Why so many losses in such a short period of time? And Alphapip was this with Hendrick's new settings?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
It was a bad day for Firebird. But please be realistic about that. To learn more about the behaviour of Firebird these bad days are necessary. You can study the trades that were made today and learn more about the different sides of Firebird. Too many people turn their back to an EA after its loosing money. That’s not the way it will work. Most EA's will work in the end if you are willing to study the results and take money management, settings and times in consideration.

We know more now about the settings (see previous posts). Another important issue is when to allow Firebird to place trades. I'm at GMT+2 and after studying the trades I will now allow Firebird make trades only between 8:00-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-18:00 and 19:00-22:00. Lets see how this will work out.

I have attached the tool I use to make these schedules (version 1.4 of EDEA).

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hendrick,

I checked out your PDF and converted your timing to EST. It seems that the best time overall for the Firebird is the US session (roughly between 7 AM and 4 PM EST). EST time is -4 GMT at the moment.

I will allow it to trade only during this time frame and post my findings here. Maybe the Asian and Euro session is not that great for it.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Please keep me informed about your progress Yardie.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I agree with you.  I understand that no system is perfect.  Over time, the wins will far outweigh the losses.  It's just a matter of being disciplined and keeping your greed in check.  I plan to continue to trade with this EA.  I haven't tried your EDEA yet, but today might be a good time to start...

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Wiz,

I agree with your logic to raise the s/l. The price swing can frequently move in wrong direction 50 to 100 pips, before it reverses back and make profits. With tp-20 and sl-120, overnight all my trades have been winners. I was watching a few trades and the price got very cost to my sl of 120 on several original orders. I was beginning to think this was going to produce several losers. But they all reversed in time and picked up some PipStep orders for profits. I have one eur/used original order that is still opened from June 19, and I have had several PipStep orders that were winners off that original order.

In my opinion the last 2 days have been slow long trending periods as the $Dollar gradually got stronger. When the market does this, even the sl=120 can be in jeopardy ansd cause multiple losing orders. It is as Hendrick has said, you should look at this EA over the long haul. I believe we will have good and bad days. I just hope there will be a lot more good days than bad ones. So far, in the short term, this has been so.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I'm having a difficult time understanding the time difference.  I am also in the states, but in CST, which I believe is GMT-6, but with the Daylight Savings Time in effect, I'm guessing that changes it.

Hendrick - I've looked at your .ini file, and it appears that you are "off" during the US session open, at 8amEST.  To help me understand, is that correct?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I am using both settings on different accounts.  The 120 SL has had no losses so far.  But it needs 6 profits for every loss, which is fine if it does not get many losses.  I realise that it is too early to abandon this EA and i don't intend to do that.

There are many EA's out there but unfortunately not many of them produce over the long term.  This may be the main problem with mechanical trading.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Again, I agreed with you. I believe backtesting an EA can not predict forward testing or live results. It does show us, however, that over time, this Forex market is always changing. Causing EAs to perform differently. The one thing we need to do is to try to alter Firebird to be as stable over time as possible. One way is Time Filter, as Hendrick has been working on. Another is a Trend Filter to assist Firebird in compensating for negative trends.

Two other ideas are:

1. Input variable to limit maximum numbers of PipStep orders on a currency pair at one time. Just in case of a negative severe spike and PipStep goes crazy placing orders.

2. Input variable to set a minimum account balance. If actual account balance falls below this point, trading stops.

The idea is to find a way to limit the loss during a negative market spike and protect the profits if the trading starts to go bad for the EA.

Just a few thoughts.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hey Alphapip CST is GMT -5 with the Daylight Savings Time factored in.

All of yesterday's trades that open in the US session were profitable 8/8 -- 7 already closed and one still open but in profit.

I have decided to run the EA 24 hours per day to see which sessions are the best to trade. I think knowing the best session would create a simplier solution than setting the EA to trade on and off with the EDEA.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I just got hit with 4 losses in a row -- all were opened in the Asian / Euro sessions.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I got 8 losses in the European/London session.  There goes the weeks profit and more.  Fast profits and even faster losses.

I am running one with Wackena's settings and it is still in profit.  No losses yet.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Yep got hit with 8 losses from the European/Asian sessions as well. Looking to see how the US session trades perform today. If they have another good day then I will edit the EA to trade US session only.

I bet Wackena's settings is good for no losses. But isnt the floating loss very big?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I think it is important to see how it performs over a much longer period without tweaking things after every bad move.  I guess it has answered my question about how it handles the big moves and if the USD keeps strengthening then my demo account will be history in one day.  Just goes to show that a system can look really great sometimes then completely blow up.

That's not to say that it doesn't have potential and I am certainly no expert.

Regarding Wakena's settings.  I have one position that is pretty close to becoming a loser.  In addition to 4 others that are negative.  If all of those turn into losers then yes it will be a problem.  So far though the total floating loss still leavs me with substantial profit - ie. 50% of my total gross profit for the week.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hey Wizard I agree with you about the longer time period. But Hendrick's data for the past 2 weeks or so is showing that most winning trades are in the US Session. I am using demo so I am looking to see how it goes. I am staying the course for now to see how it behaves.

So far 11 straight losses and counting today using Hendrick's settings.

--- 帖子 #243 ---

Hi Wizard!

What goes for real life certainly applies to Forex: "it's not all skittles and beer" (I'm Dutch and learned this phrase a long time ago at school. Never thought I could used it in something like this Forum!). What we really need is some kind of money management in Firebird. Among other things, start with small lot sizes and as your account grows start using larger ones. It will certainly prevent you from blowing up your account.  <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o> </o>

--- 帖子 #245 ---
A major problem I see with Firebird is that it does not average the trades.  If it averaged properly the large trending moves would not be as bad.

The Firebird document states, in the examples section, picture 3,

"In this example the trade goes against us.
After going long in the yellow circle the price keeps dropping.
Every 30 pips the price drops Firebird buys another lot.
The 4th lot is bought in the blue circle.
Profit is taken in the white circle.
--> The average buying price + 30 pips.
All 4 lots are sold at the same time.
Some will make a loss and some will make a profit.
On average 4x30=120 pips profit is made"

Now, obviously everyone has different pipsteps and profit targtes, but the fact remains that it does not close all open positions when an average T/P goal is met.  Instead it treats all open orders independently and closes them when their individual T/P or SL is hit.  If that can be fixed to work as it was supposed to, that would make a huge difference.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hendrick, a little off topic, but I brew beer at home and have for 30+years as a hobby. Your skittles statement made me laugh, because I had heard that banter about 10 years ago and decided to take it to task. I brewed up some skittle beer. It was not nearly as bad a I thought it would be, but man if was a frightening rainbow of colors, depending on which colors I used..

You are certainly spot on there mate.  i normally only risk 1-2% per trade but did not take that into account with my demo trades of firebird.  I am using single lots with a $10,000 demo account.  Using the 42 pip stop that's a per trade risk of 4.2% which is a bit too high for me.

In addition we need to know how a set of settings works out over the long haul, otherwise we're just blowing up our account at a slower rate.

Firebird gave me 13 losses in a row last night.  Now to recover from that i need a lot of winners just to get back to where i started.  Such is life i know.

i am testing a few other EA's from Forex TSD which look reasonable too.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Your record sounds good on paper until you check your floating positions. Lots of them open and the floating loss is pretty steep.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Having fun anyone?  I really wonder what can be done to improve this EA.  My graph at the end of my statement looks really great if I turn it upside down.

I guess the initial excitement has calmed down a bit.  The start of the week saw great profits but the last few days have have given even greater losses.

Such is life and such is the reality of forex trading.

Dont give up yet, Wiz, still testing, next test will be to trade firebird only on the first 3 days of the week, I see if I can code Firebird to trade in the opposite in the last 2 days

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Wizard you are right. The losses keep piling up in my account. Its a good thing its a demo. I still think the EA has potential, the settings just need to be tweaked. I think the 15 step may be a bit too low.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Another fine day for Firebird.. (joking). The results of last week gives a lot of stuff to think about. We will have to study the trades and try to discover the how and why of the behaviour of Firebird in a volatile market as we have seen in the last 2 days. In a stable market Firebird is doing its job: more winners than losers. But days like the last 2, gives us the opportunity to make some discoveries that can really improve Firebird.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>

<o></o>

First thing we really need is money management. I've asked Firedave if he is willing to adapt Firebird in such a way. Another thing is time. I believe that preventing Firebird to place trades during certain periods of the day will certainly help to improve its results. At last I have my own little tool EDEA working. Feel free to test it, and please let me know if it's any help to you. <o></o>

<o> </o>

--- 帖子 #256 ---
The real problem is that the losers are much bigger than the winners.  This goes against what we need to achieve to be profitable in the long run.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hendrick,

I haven't tried your tool yet, but it seems there's definitely a need for it or some type of filter.

I've spoken with the originator of Firebird (Traderseven) and he gave up on it due to programming difficulties.  I'm not ready to give up just yet.

Firebird is supposed to average positions and exit all at the same time.  I have not seen that happen.  Pipstep works fine, but it does not exit all at the same time when the average profit is met.  Is that your expereince as well?

Also, Firebird is supposed to reverse in heavily trending markets.

If either of those two rules were working, we may not have seen the negative results of the last couple days.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hi Ben,

Some parts of Firebird are still a mistery to me. But I'm determined to discover as much as I can about all aspects of Firebird and to bring it back to its basics. It may take a while but I'm convinced that in the end it will be turn out to be a one of the best EA's ever made.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hendrick,

What if we were to create an area where Firebird did not issue trades.  What I have in mind is a second, wider envelope around the initial .05 envelope -- the thought being that if prices travels to this second enveleope it is more likely in a trend and contrary to the best use of Firebird.

As long as price ranges within a certain area, Firebird cannot be beat.  It's when it gets out of this area that trading activity should cease until it returns.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
It depends on the relation between SL and TP. Until now it's still my opinion that a SL of 52 to a TP of 26 is still better than a SL=200 and a TP=20. Next week I will return to TP=18 and SL=42 and I will run 2 demo's: one without time filter and one with the following trade hours 8:00-12:00, 13:00-15:00, 16:00-18:00 and 19:00-22:00 (GMT+2). I will use EDEA for this. I think that this time filter is essential to improve the results of EDEA. Next Friday I will post the results.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Great thinking Ben! I will use your suggestion during the weekend when I will investigate the trades of Firebird from this week.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Something like this:  The inside envelope is at .05  The outer envelope is .2  I'm not saying .2 is an ideal number, but you can see when it strayed into the .2 envelope Firebird trades were ill-advised until it returned to the optimal ranging behavior.Sorry, but having trouble uploading a picture.  I get an error message that the picture is too big.  But I think you understand my idea.

Hey Hendrick, I share your enthusiasm. Keep me posted.

Today was actually a good day. I had 6 winning trades in a row. However, they are still not enough to cover the multitude of losses from yesterday.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hendrick. ANy particular reason why you are returning to TP 18 and SL 42? Looking forward to read your results next week. I am staying the course with the current settings for next week.

From my history this week I see that I had 17 wins and 7 losses from all the trades opened between GMT 11h and GMT 20h (roughly the US session). That is 7 AM EST to 4 PM EST.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi Yardie,

17 wins and 7 losses. So with a TP of 26 and a SL of 52 you should have a surplus of 3 winning trades. Not bad at all if you take in account the last 2 days of this week. What are your settings? I see that you only trade during the US session. Do you think it's possible for you to run 2 demo-accounts next week with the same settings and let run one of them for 24h and the other from 11h until 20h? I will do the same but with different times. At the end of the week we can see if it make sense to disable Firebird during certain parts of the week.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I am not planning of giving up that easily.  i am still testing the lorger stop loss as posted by wackena.  These setting seem to be doing ok.  Movements like the last few days do not seem to happen very often so with proper MM we may be able to survive such drawdowns.

The EA does look promising and maybe you are right.  Perhaps it needs the time filter.  i plan to also stick with the settings for a while longer.  i am also running it on 30 min charts.

One question i do have is.  has anyone found EA's to be a profitable way of trading - ie. in the long term.  perhaps it is better to run several different EAs at the same time to try to even things up a bit.  just a thought.

Wiz.

Hey Everyone,

I've been watching Firebird this last week same as the rest of you, but I've also been speaking with some other traders about completely different topics and I'm convinced that Firebird is literally that - it turns your account into a phoenix - in other words it burns it to the ground and then you have to reincarnate your trading account with new capital.

The idea of larger stop losses scares me!  Look at a daily chart and you will see that the market often moves 700+pips in one direction for a month or more.  Yes there are retracements in there - but the last few days show us what can happen - and it ain't good.

What do I propose?  What about defining that underlying trend - reducing the envelope size to a rediculously small level, minimizing the pipstep, and only allowing Firebird to open trades in the direction of that overall trend?

This way we could mimimize our stop loss and maximize our target profit - which seems to make way more sense as right now Firebird is set up to take a bunch of minimal wins, followed by HUGE losses.  We should be aiming to do the exact opposite.

Now - I could be 100% wrong - and for the record I have not tested this method.  Just wanted to share my thoughts.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi,

Benq, can you please post the document which u r referring to in ur post #245....considering the recent losses in firebird, i am trying to rework it and i guess the document would be useful.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Here it is.What about applying something as simple as an ADX filter with a < or > variable.  If the market started trending strongly, all trading would cease and open positions closed until it started ranging again.  just thinking out loud here.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hendrick, the settings are yours TP of 26 and SL of 52. I am running the EA 24 hours per day and looking in the history to see the opening times. Based on that history, I had 17 wins and 7 losses for the orders opened during the US session. My record is much worse for the 24 hour history. By the way, I started the EA on Wednesday morning US time.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Let me show you the results from 13-6 until 20-6 (see attachment). In this period we have 95 winners and 28 losers. With a SL of 42 and a TP of 18 this means we have a surplus 31 winners (approximately). When I should have used the following time filters: 8-12, 13-15, 16-18, 19-23 there would be 85 winners and 17 losers Again with a SL=42 and a TP=18 this means a surplus of 46 winners. So in a stable market Firebird will operate excellent. Agree? Now take the last week. A sharp downfall of the GBPUSD (for example). And what does Firebird; it's going long several times because after a downfall it's expecting a retracement. In this case; wrong! The downfall sustained resulting in several losses. These things will happen all the time. We can't predict when these things will happen and how long it will takes before a retracement will start. But what we can do is to tell Firebird to step aside during a really volatile market. Stop placing trades and wait for the storm to calm down. If we can (and we need a programmer to realize this) it is in my conviction one of the best EA's. What do you think about it?<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>

--- 帖子 #273 ---
benq, thanks for the document...any idea what program i have to use to open it..cos it automatically opens in IE and all that i see is junk...

--- 帖子 #274 ---
having an ADX filter seems a good idea...as benq suggested, the idea is to somehow make firebird recognise that it is in the midst of a strong trend and make it adjust accordingly....so how do we make sure that it knows that it is in a strong trend....usually all EAs work well in a trending environment and dont work so well in a ranging market...but firebird does the opposite.....looks interesting....

--- 帖子 #275 ---
ok guys....i am planning to plug in a adx filter and see what happens....can someone tell me what settings are the best so far (currency pair, settings and chart time period) so that i can plug inb the adx filter, put in the best settings and see what happens......

--- 帖子 #276 ---
It's just an html document.  Should open right up.  Does anyone esle have it in another form?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hendrick,

Can you please post your latest version of EDEA and instructions on how to use it?  Is it an indicator, or does it somehow get plugged into Firebird?  Is it referencing platform time or my computer time.  I'm running platforms that are GMT and GMT +2 but I'm in EST, which is I believe GMT -4.  All a bit confusing.  Thx.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
NS Karthic,

Can you open this one?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I think our search for the holy grail is leading us down the garden path with a blindfold on!

The larger moves that we are trying to avoid with this EA are the ones that we should be trying to profit from - I mean we could have made 500 pips in a matter of a couple of days on the majors.  Why are we "trying" to avoid that??

Maybe I'm crazy - but we first need to address the problem of Firebird - its averaging down on losing positions - then we'll have a strong base.  But then again - maybe I'm just crazy.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Lonespruce, that would be an entirely different EA.  Firebird was never meant to be trend following.

There are plenty of other EA's and methods that are designed to exploit trends and I'm sure there's threads here somewhere.  I think this thread is taking the path of trying to improve Firebird.

The question to ask then is do you want to write an entirely different EA ignoring Firebird's strength (ranging markets) and instead focus on a completely different approach to take pips out of the market.  It's much easier to take pips out 10-20 at a time than 500 at a time -- which is why I'm still focused on Firebird.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
ns,

This is going to be somewhat subjective because you have to decide what ADX level you'll designate as the start of a trend.  I think most people who use ADX consider readings of above 25-30 or so to be trending markets.  But you have to also consider +DI and -DI.  Start with the default setting of 14.

Typically, you would go long when +DI is above -DI and either: ADX rises while +DI and ADX are above -DI; or ADX turns up from below +DI and -DI. And go short when -DI is above +DI and either: ADX rises while -DI and ADX are above +DI; or ADX turns up from below +DI and -DI. Now, a declining ADX shows that the market is losing direction. When ADX falls below both +DI and -DI it signals a lifeless market.

And so what you would want to do is avoid the areas that potentially signal a trend.  Seems like quite a bit of code writing.

What do you think of my earlier idea of simply creating another, wider envelope around the trading envelope -- kind of a "no-trade zone" where all trading stops.  Trading could begin again once a trade is triggered in the opposite direction.  The thinking there being that if we moved far enough in the opposite direction to breach the other side of the trading envelope the trend as probably ended.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
hey thanks ben...i was able to open this one...will go thru and let u know...thanks again....

--- 帖子 #283 ---
You will find all of it in #255

--- 帖子 #284 ---
hmmmm...actually, i was just thinking of going ahead with the adx values...like, take no trades if adx level is say 25....this way we could eliminate lot of the wrong trades if not all...probably we could start off with just the adx level and then improvise it with the other levels to make it still better....

i still have not got the settings which work best with this....

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hendrick, what happens to positions that are already open when you enter one of your pre-set "no trade" times?  Is it closed out or just left to run?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi Ben,

EDEA is doing no more and no less than triggering the " Expert Advisors" button in MT4. So open trades are left to run.

(Have been studying the code of Firebird now for 2 days non-stop. Gives me a real headache. Made a quick indicator (FirebirdSafe) based on a the builtin indicators "Bears power" and "Bulls power". Gives some kind of safe-zone for Firebird to operate. You can test it if you like against your trades from last week - only visual. See you).

--- 帖子 #287 ---

Thursday;

Close for that day 19:50

Friday:

Close from 10:50 to 11:45

I'm very curious what will be the results next Friday!!

Hello Hendrick,

What is the difference between these settings and the one you had before (before changing to 26 TP and 52 SL)?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Here's an indicator that shades the background of a chart depending on what session you're in.  You have to adjust the inputs for your GMT offset, but it might be useful for anyone trying to code Firebird to trade in certain sessions.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I can't attach the new safe firebird MT4 to any of my charts.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hey Yardie,

All the settings are the same as before except the setting for PipStep. It's now 40 instead of 15.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
It's an indicator. Have you placed it in the right folder? (\experts\indicators).

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi,

i am planning to write an EA which will call firebird EA when ADX < 0 and will call another EA(which works well under trending conditions) when adx>=20....

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Sounds great NS. I will test it once its complete.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Perfect NS.  I don't have the ability to code, otherwise I would have, but that's just what's needed some type of "anti trend" filter.  I can test at least two versions here if needed.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hendrick, How do you read FirebirdSafe?  It places a subgraph at the bottom of the chart. All lines are green -- some below zero line and some above. How does it indicate optimal trading type for Firebird?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hey Hendrick,

I am going to test these new settings this week as well. But I made one slight modification. I am making the TP 21 instead of 18 pips. This way, I can make up for a loss with 2 win instead of 2 wins+ with a 18 pips TP. I will be doing it 24 hours per day.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi Guys

As of this week I have modified Firebird to traded in the opposite direction if there are sharp movements. Basicly what it is, is to have a firebird inside a firebird and when it reaches the outside levels it trades in opposite direction than it would normally( in other words follow the spike until it gets inside the outer walls again). I've also added money management to it. I'll be posting results daily.

Mono

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hey Mono,

Thats a great start!

You may want to read about ATDMF - its a technical trading strategy using Bollinger Bands that may be of some use.  It defines trading opportunites by price closing outside of the bands.  Anyhow it would take a long time to explain in one post.  But it may be of great use in defining a 'trending' market in terms of the 'new firebird'.

I have some documentation if you're interested.  I look forward to your results - this will be a great improvement to an EA that has a fatal flaw... but maybe not for long

lonespruce.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
That sounds promising and a little like the "Firehedge" option that was supposed to work in Firebird.  Looking forward to seeing how it works.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I think a bigger pipstep is much better.  I was using a 40 pipstep on one account and that one is still in profit.  The stop was 120pips on that one but the amazing thing is that it is still in profit since I started 11 days ago.

I will try a pipstep of 80, on another account and see if it works better.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Wiz, Can you post that statement please. I was using 15 and it just entered way too many trades in the big move. I now have versions running with 20, 30 and 40 but I'd like to see what it did the passed 11 days.  So you're using 120 as SL and 40 as pip step, but what target?  Thx.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
So far this week 2 wins and zero loss with the new settings TP 21 SL 42 and Pipsterp 40.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I also changed my EA to run with TP-25 SL-50 and PipStep-25.  Last 24 hrs = 4 winners, 0 losers.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
20 pip target.  Statment atatched.

Actually the statement shows a starting date of the 15th but includes Thursday and Friday's losses.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Today was another proof of Firebird's ability to make money in a market where there are only small movements up and down. 9 winners and no losers. So the main goal here is to get Firebird step aside when the market gets volatile. I've made a new version of Firebird were I added the next condition for SELLS and BUYS:

double Safe1=iBullsPower(NULL,0,20,6,0)+iBearsPower(NULL,0,20,6,0);

if(Safe1>-0.0050 && Safe1<0.0050)

Safe1=1;

In short: when the Bulls or the Bears have the upper hand, Firebird will place no trades. Lets see if it makes any difference this week.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Now up to 6 wins and one loss using these settings.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
pipstep?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Nice work, Hendrick.  I'm anxious to see the results of an added volatility parameter, which is just what Firebird seems to need.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
7 winners and 2 floating in profit. Also note, I am only trading 3 majors (not USD/JPY)

*EDIT* Attached .set file.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
BenQ,

I've conducted a lot of Live, forward testing and backtesting on Firebird v63g and, in my opinion, a tp to sl ratio of 1 : (4-6) works best. 1 to 6 has peformed best for me.

Tp to PipStep ratio of 1 : 2  has performed best.  For tp = 20 and sl=120, PipStep of 40 has work best. Also, tp=10, sl=60 & PipStep=20 works well too. I think you can go higher or lower, as long as you stay near these ratios.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Thx, wackena.  I am testing various combinations and the higher SL combined with higher pipstep is working well for me too.  In addition to the major 4, I'm also testing on USDCAD and EURJPY.  We'll see, but I still think Firebird needs a volatility filter -- perhaps the wider envelope I mentioned earlier or some variation of it.

I need a primer on metatrader coding.  My main platform has always been esignal, but I'm starting to lean toward meta to automate some of my stuff.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Is it possible for one to run two EAs at the same time in two different accounts using the same MT4 software? If so how would one go about doing it? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hendrick,

This could be a very good idea. Also we can this to grab a few trending orders too. We see the big spikes many times. Usually, we already have an open order and Firebird wasn't design to take advantage of these spikes. We can use this iBullsPower to place a Buy and IBearsPower a Sell order at the beginning of the spikes. We don't want it to go crazy, so we arrange the code to allow it trade at the beginning of the Bulls or Bears movement, but limit it to only send order if open orders on that currency pair is <= a preset number. I tested this on a backtest and the result were impressive.

Something like the following. Your code will stop trading, but because below the code has changed the Bulls and Bears threshold value by +-0.0010, it will send order before your code stops trading. It seems we can pick up a profit trade here and there.

extern double BullsBearsFactor=0.0050;// different currencies need different factor - 0.0050 will not allow any trading on some currencies- 0.0030 seems to be a good factor

extern int OpenOrdersPerPair=1; // use range 1 to 3

double Safe1=iBullsPower(NULL,0,20,6,0)+iBearsPower(NULL, 0,20,6,0);

if(Safe1 >- BullsBearsFactor && Safe1 < BullsBearsFactor)

Safe1=1;

if( Safe1==1) return(0); else

if (Safe1>-(BullsBearsFactor-0.0010) && MyOrdersTotal()<=OpenOrdersPerPair) OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,Lots,Ask,slip,Ask-(Stoploss*Point),Ask+(TakeProfit*Point),
GetCommentForOrder(),MagicNumber,0,clOpenBuy);

Then just complete the Bears code in same method.

Remember, I am not a programmer. Just a few thoughts.

Testing update

Test1

Running now since the 19th, still no losses recorded, its doing nicely.

Test2

As for the other test with firebird within firebird, its performing badly, need to fix some processes. I'll keep you posted.

Mono

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Mono,

When you say Test 1 are you reffering to running the EA only on the first 3 days?  What settings are you using?

This firebird sure clocks up some good trades.  It's a pitty it has to have losers

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Wiz,

Test1 is the first set of testing thats been on since the 19th trading 6 currencies

Check below

http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&postcount=247

Slowly the losses are being pegged back.

Currently profits are @ $1507 with ongoing trades @ -$690 (was -$1200 at one stage).

Hopefully, the lossed will be down to a reasonable level before the US interest rate statement later this week or else I'll be recording my first loss/losses.

Mono

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi wackena,

I like this. See if I can incorporate this in my new testversion of Firebird.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Since firebird give a lot of good trades why not just eliminate the pipstep altogether.  At least that should get rid of the "adding to losers" flaw.  This seems to be the main weakness.

Just an oppinion.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
TWOO,

This is not a bad idea. If you set pip step to 0, you would suffer a loss of the maximum stoploss setting, but then the trade would resume at the new level. Unless the move was greater than the maximum stoploss and if so, it would trade again and loose a second maximum stop loss, and so on and so on, for the total length of the trend move. If you could make it not trade again until the system was reset this would prevent that.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
We know that Firebird can have several losing trades in a spike or long trending up and down market. I think we may be able to minimize these loses. To Safe Guard our initial investment and future profits, here are a few ideas.

extern int    OpenOrdersPerPair=2; // limit number of open orders
extern int    MinAccountBalance = 4900;// stop trading below this level

if( MyOrdersTotal()>=OpenOrdersPerPair || AccountBalance() < MinAccountBalance) return(0); else

The OpenOrdersPerPair variable is used to stop trading when a preset number of orders are already open.

The MinAccountBalance variable is used to stop trading if the AccountBalance falls below preset level. This variable will need to be manually adjusted as needed to protect profits or if trading does stop due to AccountBalance falling below the preset MinAccountBalance.

In either case, your existing open orders can still be in jeopardy.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I join the thread a little bit too late but anyway here is my opinion:

Basically we set some support/resistance levels and try to buy/sell exactly there, 30 pips away and next 30 pips away. (for extern int OpenOrdersPerPair=2;) We consider this as a complete system. But in fact there are 3 different systems! One says buy at support, another says buy 30 pips below support and the third says buy 60 pips below support.

Has anyone tried to test the effectivness of them separately? This is important, because if the first earns 30% monthly, the second earns 20% monthly and the third earns 10% monthly, then it is better to trade using ONLY the first one.

Let us say we got 3000$ and we invest 50% of the funds.

If we trade using only one 30% system then investing 50%*3000$=1500$ after a month we become 450$ return.

If we trade usng all three system then every one of them gets 1/3 of our 3000$. That is 1000$. We invest 50% so 500$. So the first earns 500$*30%=150$ the second earns 500$*20%=100$ and the third earns 500%*10%=50$. Together we earn 150+100+50= only 300$

It is obviously more comfortable to see that MOST of trades end up with a positive result, but the end result really matters.

So.... has anyone tried to calculate it independently?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Wiz, I think that's a near brilliant suggestion.  I'm still waiting to see the results from those who have added volatility filters in, but I can say the versions I'm running with higher pipsteps are doing quite well in the short term.  Now you have me serously thinking about running another version without the pipstep.  Very interesting suggestion, thanks.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
After I followed this thread a few weeks I wonder if there is a EA with all the new suggestions and with a vol. filter. Is there anybody developing one because I don't want to start one and a few days later there is one posted .

So please reply if there is one in development

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Well so far I am about 15 wins and one loss since Sunday. But the market has been mostly ranging. I think this EA can be a winner if its design to take advantage of spikes and drops.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I agree, this is a ranging EA. We require a trending EA and a News Trading /Spiking EA.

Anyway below is my testing update.

All testing is done on 6 pairs and run 24hrs.

Mono

--- 帖子 #329 ---
OK stupid question coming up: I need to leave the computer on all day for this EA right?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Yes, as with all EAs the instruction set stays with the computer, the orders and the pending orders are at the host. So as new orders are placed, they are generated from the EA at the client computer. It must remain on and the EA tab at the top must remain Green.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
This is a new version of Firebird (Firebirdv63H) with 9 new settings:<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>

<o></o>

SafeArea<o></o>

<o></o>

This setting is based on the idea that Firebird is doing well in a flat market, but could go wrong when the market gets volatile. The indicator (Firebirdv63H_IND) gives you an idea how this function works (you don’t need to attach this indicator to your charts for Firebirdv63H to work). The indicator is quit simple: it takes the values of the built-in indicators “ Bulls Power” and “ Bears Power” and adds them together. When these powers are in balance it’s safe to trade. When Bulls or Bears get the upper hand their sum crosses a certain level (until now I think levels of 40 and -40 works well) and Firebird isn’t allowed to place trades.<o></o>

<o></o>

TradeFrom1 <o></o>

TradeUntil1 <o></o>

TradeFrom2<o></o>

TradeUntil2<o></o>

TradeFrom3<o></o>

TradeUntil3<o></o>

TradeFrom4<o></o>

TradeUntil4<o></o>

<o></o>

I’ve dropped EDEA because it is easier to incorporate the same idea in Firebird itself. You have now the ability to set four times a day that Firebird is allowed to place trades. These are local times and not the server times. If you want Firebird to trade from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM use the following settings:<o></o>

<o></o>

TradeFrom1=8 <o></o>

TradeUntil1=23<o></o>

<o></o>

Use a “<?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:metricconverter ProductID="0”" w:st="on">0”</st1:metricconverter> for the rest of the settings. <o></o>

<o></o>

Indicator:<o></o>

You can use several settings within the indicator:<o></o>

<o></o>

PC = Price Constants<o></o>

<o></o>

1 = Open price<o></o>

2 = High price<o></o>

3 = Low price.<o></o>

4 = Median price, (high+low)/2.<o></o>

5 =Typical price, (high+low+close)/3<o></o>

6 = Weighted close price, (high+low+close+close)/4.<o></o>

<o></o>

TF=TimeFrame<o></o>

Hey Hendrick,

What if instead of losing position averaging a fixed stop loss would be executed? Averaging a losing position is like drilling a second hole in a sinking boat and gives me the creeps.

Hendrick.  You're a champion.  Thanks for all your efforts.

An interesting thing is that I am still running the 18 TP 42SL with 15 pipstep, which really bombed out last week and it is now just over 10% in profit since I began.  The best performer has been the 20TP and 120SL.  A few losses last week but 23 straight profits since then.  That one is up 15% overall.

I'll compare the new one on yet another instance of MT4. Sounds promising but I want to test it longer.  With decent MM this seems to be doing quite well.

Hey Hendrick. If I want the EA to trade 24 hours do I leave all the settings at 0?

Is the Safearea setting configurable? I would like it to be -50 + 50 instead.

Thanks for all your efforts!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi Yardie,

If you want to trade 24 hours use the following settings:

TradeFrom1=0

TradeUntil1=24

In the properties of this version you can adjust the setting of SafeArea from 40 to 50.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Is everyone testing on just the Major 4? In my latest round of testing Firebird (6 versions all with slightly different parameter sets) I've included EURJPY and USDCAD. So testing 6 pairs all together now.

Lately I've been wondering about the feasability of dropping historically strong trending pairs in favor of the more "lazy pairs" since a ranging market is better suited to Firebird's strengths. Keeping the spread tight though is a concern. Any thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
My record since Sunday is 24 wins - 4 losses with the settings SL 50 TP 25 PIPSTEP 40. I am trading EURUSD GBPUSD USDCHF USDJPY EURJPY USDCAD. I notice that the GBPUSD is the most active pair though.  I am 7 wins 3 losses on the GBPUSD pair so far this week.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Thx.  I have 3 combo's that are pretty much neck and neck so far this week:  TP20 SL120 PS40; TP18 SL42 PS40; TP20 SL80 PS40.  Four other versions are a bit behind these three, but it's still early.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
BenQ your combos all seem to be the same except for the SL. And the SL will be tested only when there is a spike or trend. I think they may be tested tomorrow and Friday. I am anxiously awaiting the big moves to see how Hendrick's new EA perform with my settings.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Yes, I know.  Right now I'm just testing different stops. I like the 40 pipstep. It's been too quiet to test my stops so far. I haven't tried Hendrick's new EA yet. I was going to close out these this week and start his next week. Did you get it up and running without any issues and it's executing trades?

What other parameters are you testing besides the set you posted?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Yes I have it up and running and executing trades with no problems. I am testing just the one parameter. I think this one will work well in all conditions..coupled with the new features in Hendricks version H. We will know for sure in the next two days...also NFP next week.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Are you just using the SafeArea feature on default settings or are you also setting times?  I'm anxious to try it but want to test my stop level parameters this week.

Do you plan on settings times for FOMC and NFP or are you going to let SafeArea handle those?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
BenQ I am running the EA 24 hours per day and will make the SafeArea setting handle everything. I left it at the default 40 for now. I want to see the resilience of the the EA in all market conditions and think this is the best way to go about it. Alphapips mentioned that he is up 10% since July 19th with the original settings even after last week's string of losses. I think this is great.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
So tradefrom 1 is set at 0 and tradeuntil 1 is at 24. And all the rest are 0, is that right?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Yep thats right .

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hey Piccolo,

I think your right there. Averaging a losing position is not one of my favourites. In <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on"><st1lace w:st="on">Phoenix</st1lace></st1:City> (the revival of Firebird) we will use another technique to handle losing positions.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>

Hi All

I have been reading this thread for a while , but i feel a bit lost , In general wouldn't be a good idea to attach the final copy of the expert after all the modification been made to start testing it ? i can understand that its difficult yet that you guys have reached that final pic. but it would be good for a bieginer like me to catch up with all the up to date effort .

I'm not sure who has the last version and that's why i couldn't address the massage to any body but i'm sure that all of you lads are happy to help and that's what make this forum the best .

The idea of put the subjects in an index would be worth looking at as well to help us find the beginig and the end of each thread

Thanks in advance for your help

--- 帖子 #352 ---
You will find the latest version in #333

We see warnings like this one when Firebird is compiled.

Function "CloseLoosingTrades" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file

Could someone look at these warnings and advise how to modify code to use these functions. I would like to see what they actually do.

Thanks,

Wackena

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Are you seeing that on Hendrick's H version?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
BenQ I think he is actually playing around with the code. I see no such errors using the EA. Anyhow here are my results so far this week -- W -- L.

June 26th - 6 - 1

June 27th - 12 - 1

June 28th - 10 - 2

June 29th - 1 - 2

Total to Date: 29-6

--- 帖子 #359 ---
BenQ,

These functions have been removed from Hendrick's H version. These are in the original Firebird v63g version. I have attached that version and when you compiled it, you will see the warnings.

I am curous if these functions were working, could they help when loosing trades are happening.

Wackena,

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi all. I am still running with the 63G version. This week with TP25 SL50 PS25, I'm at 21 wins, 3 losses, for a net of 15 wins on 3 majors, take USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi guys

Is it possible to attach the firebird expert to as many 15min. chart as i can Or

it won't work unless i attach it to one 15 min chart at a time

Thanks

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I have mine attached to about 6 15 minute charts. I hope you are trying it on a demo Baz.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Oh yes i'm trying it on Demo

Thanks

--- 帖子 #364 ---
18:10 GMT. The Dollar took a hit. The top 4 currency pairs have spikes. There will be several winners and losers on this spike.  This is where Hendrick's Bulls/Bears control of spikes will be useful.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #365 ---
It handled the spikes very well. My record for the week is now 33 wins - 6 losses.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
The dollar suppose to go stronger because they have increased the interest rate but instead it went down Why?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hendrick's

After this code, I put in a comments line, as you see below. It works OK on all charts except usd/jpy. This means, that this chart is not being controlled by this code. I first noticed this, when we had the spike today and the Firebird Safe indicator valve was -150 for the usd/jpy and the comments line was not activated. eur/usd, gbp/usd & usd/chf displayed the comments line on the chart during the spike.

double Safe1=iBullsPower(NULL,0,20,6,0)+iBearsPower(NULL,0,20,6,0);

if(Point==0.01) Safe1=Safe1*100;

if(Point==0.0001) Safe1=Safe1*10000;

if((Safe1>-SafeArea) && (Safe1<SAFEAREA))< p> Safe1=1;

if(Safe1!=1)Comment("OpenOrders = ",MyOrdersTotal()," SafeArea Alarm - Trade Off");

What do you think?

Wackena.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Because it was expected, and some people were speculating on a 0.5% hike.  Also the language of the announcement left room for a pause in the interest rate hikes - meaning that they may not raise rates the next time around.

You have to rememeber that expectations are priced in

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hendrick,

I trade the new EA on six charts, my USDJPY, EURJPY and USDCAD charts are fine but my GBPUSD, USDCHF and EURUSD charts are saying "Not Dafe To Trade" even though the market has settled down. Is this normal? When does it kick back into action?

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hendrick, let's say I wanted to exclude a certain time because of a pending news event, let's say at 7 pm, and wanted to stop trading an hour before until an hour after.  Would I set TradeFrom1 =0, TradeUntil1 =18 and then TradeFrom2 =20, TradeUntil2 = 24 and then set all the rest at zero?

Could I use the setting 1830, for example?

And these times are based on my local computer time or the GMT offset time of my platform?  Thx

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Guys

I hope you all made a killing with the FOMC statement (should have picked up 500+ pips in an hour trading.....I love news days).

News days are best traded by hedging/straddling your pairs. What I do is, when news is looming, five minutes before, I place 2 orders 15-20 Pips above and 15-20 pips below the current price. Example. GBPUSD - 5 min close was @ 1.8105, I then placed my Buy at 1.8120 and sell @ 1.8090. I pulled out @ 1.8278 & cancelled the sell order. Thats 150+ pips for 1 pair.

Anyway, the FOMC statement helped my test results in a big way. Floating positions went from about -$1500 to -$600. But before hand I recorded my first loss, not bad 1 loss in 9 days trading.

Mono

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi Ben,

Yes, these are the right settings if you want to prevent Firebird placing trades between 18 and 20. You can't use a setting of 1830 because the TradeFrom and TradeUntil expects hours. So only settings from 0 to 24 are valid. These settings are based on your local computer time.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Yardie,

Attach the indicator for v63H I posted earlier, to your chart and use the same settings for the SafeArea that you use for the EA. That way it becomes visible when it is "Safe tot trade" or "Not safe to trade".

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi Wackena,

Strange! I will look at this in the weekend.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hendrick,

I should have checked other Demo and Live accounts that are running other versions of Firebird. No orders for USD/JPY charts on all accounts since june 27. Also, No comments are appearing on any USD/JPY charts.

This is very strange. May be my problem at my end, but I don't think so.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi,

same goes for my EA, no activity/info on USD/JPY and EUR/JPY pairs.

I use V63H02.

Have a nice weekend..

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Mono,

nice strategy

Which news releases do u use this on? Only FOMC or??

Thanks for the info, and keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #378 ---
I am recording trades for both of these pairs.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Did your "Not Safe to Trade" message finally resolve itself, Yardie?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Yes sure did. It looks like the EA is working as it should. Today been a bad day 0 wins and 4 losses. Which put back my overall record for the week to 33 wins and 11 losses

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Ouch -- but you should still be ahead 500 pips or so if you're still using 25/50.  I shut mine down yesterday about an hour before FOMC.  All open trades were left open and all went to profit.  I usually shut it down early Friday and not trade, but since there was a bit of news Thursday night and early this morning I never turned it back on.  So I guess I missed a few loosers, but Firebird has a good chance of making up for those by the end of the day.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi Guys!

The work on the new Phoenix EA is getting very well! I've seen Firebird made some wrong trades just after a spike. That's why I'm now trying to develop a "Spike Detector" that will be incorporated in Phoenix. It works as follows: when a spike is detected in the last 12 hours (this setting is adjustable) Phoenix will wait until "the storm" calms down and is then allowed to place only sells (if the spike was up) or buys (if the spike was down). Looking at the last 2 days I think this option (together with SafeArea and the adjustable trade times) will be very helpful to prevent Phoenix in going the wrong way.

As soon as Phoenix is ready (patience!) I will open a new thread. Together we can make this Phoenix an EA that can make us some money on the log run!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
All,

I think my EA is not working.  I had to reboot my PC about 12 hours ago, and there have been 0 trades since.  EA is running, but nothing executed.  I've closed all my charts, opened new ones, and reattached the EA, but no luck.

Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Try deleting the EA and installing a fresh one and see if that helps.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Well 33 x 25 = 825

11 x 50 = 550

825 - 550 = 275 net pips. This is still good in my book.

I want to see how the EA performs over time in all conditions and I think allowing it to run through is the best way to find out.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
oops -- I guess I should have just done the math . Still good though. Have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Well got another loss so 0-5 today and 225 net pips on the week. Good thing I started at the beginning of the week and not the end of the week otherwise things wouldnt be pretty right now.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
That's really unusual to go 0-5.  Maybe just Friday blahs.  4th of July coming up too -- may be a slow start to the week as well.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Here you can see the difference in behaviour between Phoenix and Firebird for the USDCHF when things are getting rough:

Firebird was placing 3 BUYS, all stopped out.

Phoenix is waiting for the right moment, made 3 SELLS which all hit the TP.

Nice?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hendrick,

I have got to hand it too you - you've turned an EA that was more than 50% account imploder - into something with great promiss.  I'm glad that the collective in this thread has seen the light - averaging up is much better than averaging down - especially in a strong trend!  Of course Firebird is great the way it was in choppy markets.... now you may have the best of both worlds

And seeing as I'm no programmer - I'm glad that someone was able to make it happen!

Congrats and great job on all the hard work and not giving up - I'll be honest - there's no doubt that I would not have been able to program those ideas.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
As you can see on the chart for the USDCHF for the last week Firebird is doing very well in a range bound market. As the markets becomes trending Firebird is very often making the wrong decisions. So the solution for this can be very simple: we have to get out as soon as the marker becomes trending and come back when the range bound market is restored.

In Phoenix there is a piece of code that's looking after these changes. In short it takes the Highs of the last 24, 12, 6 and 2 hours and can decide when the market becomes trending and when the range bound market is restored.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Thanks lonespruce!

Your message gives me the right spirit to continue the work. With the support of all these nice people in this thread I'm sure we will have an EA in the end that will do its job: making us money.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi there

Can some one atach the EA expert with the new firebird formula added , because i have tried to add the formula into the script but it was unseccessful try . I need to test both experts starting next week , i have tried the firebird end of last week but the market seems to be trending and that why couldn't juje the results , Any ideas about a useful tol to detect the change in the market situation from trending to a ranging market ?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hendrick,

I'd like to run some side by side comparisons this coming week. Can the SafeArea function in your new version be turned off or disabled?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Good comparison Hendrick. But it would have been interesting to see how the G version of Firebird with the Safe Area perform vis a vis the new Phoenix. Although I think the Phoenix idea of making money in the trend is a nice one. When do you think it will be released? I am dying to start testing it.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi Ben,

The maximum value of SafeArea is 100. So if you use this value it will be the same as disabeling this function.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi Yardie,

I realy need to do some testing on Firebird. I think 2 weeks and it's ready to launch.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Hendrick

Are you using the latest firebirdH3 with another indicator? i'm welling to test the uptodate version that you have , in your previous reply you were sying its going to be ready in 2 weeks where you going to launch the latest version ?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hendrick, looking at your SafeArea indicator, does this quote simply mean that when the indicator is outside of the 40/-40 channel trades are not initiated, is that how it works? Thx

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Did any body hear about using that indicator ''linear regression'' searching another form i have found that programmed and it seems that its useful , any idea on how to use it ? i have got the code in case any one needs it

Thanks

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Well my tally last week was 35-13 (6 of the losses coming in on Friday). I still have one order open from Friday a SELL EURUSD.

So far this week I am 5-0. I have tweaked my settings a bit to TP 25 SL 40 and PS 35.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Yes!

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hi Hendrick,

When  Firebird reaches the end of the time setting it is allowed to trade, do you manually close all the open trades? Or, do you leave them to close on their own?

Thanks scott

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi Guys

Into the 3rd week of testing, still only 1 loss recorded. Floating positions range from -$600 to -$1300 but profit bookings are steady. I expect to record another loss or 2 later in the week.

Mono

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Firebird is up 7 wins to 1 loss so far this week.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Tthe time setting is only there to prevent Firebird taking new positions. Open trades are not closed.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Thanks for the answer.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hendrich and other,

just wanna thanks for all your effort devolping this super EA, i have tested it some weeks with different settings and in my opinion it just gets better every week  I am not a tech guy, so unfurtnately I can not contribute with coding etc... But I have a few suggestions to the next versions:

A) Make a function to automatically close all trades more than i.e. 24 hrs old...

(because the older the trades get, the less likely they will be in profit it seems)

B) Make a lot increase/decrease function, depending on the acc. balance

(so one can use the max of the acc. balance always)

Just my 2 cents, if these functions already exsists, bare with me!!!

Keep up the good work guys...

Hendrich, when will you release the new Phoenix version?

Have a nice day

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hi Fingo,

The new Phoenix EA (revival of Firebird and still under development) has a Money Management function.

Closing all trades more than 24 hrs old could be an idea. Maybe someone can test this. Until now I have rather good results with closing trades as soon as the buy/sell signal changes.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I'm still waitting for some answers for my previous questions , any help

Thanks

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I allow my trades to stay open and sort themselves out. I find that they end up in profit eventually...and the hedging is not such a bad thing when Firebird choose a different direction on an open trade. I personally would rather manage the Money Management of the EA on my own -- rather than it being automatic. I hope this will be an option Hendrick and that money management will not be hard coded into Phoenix.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I let mine sort themselves out too. The only time I see positions opened in the opposite direction is on my demos that have a TP over 25 -- which makes some sense since price has to travel farther and may breach the oppsite side of the envelope before the target is hit.

I'd like to see some MM incorporated into Firebird (or Phoenix). And the enable/disable option is always nice.  I like Fingo's suggestions above.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
In the last 12 hours (overnight here in the States) Firebird is 12-0.  16-0 for the week.  WOOHOO!

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hey Alpha,

Also, I plan to disable Firebird on Friday.  Someone had mentioned earlier in this forum (I would credit them, if I could remember who it was) that they look at the FF Economic calendar on the home page, and if there is a "Red" event which is expected to produce high volatility, then to stand aside.  After last weeks crumble, I plan to test that theory.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I am reading 9-2 for July 5th (GMT +2). My settings are SL 40 and TP 25 PIPSTEP 35. Firebird H version. I think we might have a winner here...especially with the tweaks by Hendrick (and the further tweaking in the Phoenix successor).

--- 帖子 #418 ---
My SL is 50, which may be why I don't have the same 2 losses.  Looking at the history, I can see where I was very close to being stopped out, but prices retraced for profit.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Well I am liking the settings I have. According to my log I have 18 wins and 9 losses so far this week. Yet I am netting 70 pips. So maybe it all works out in the end.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Two statements (Firebirdv63G and Phoenixv1) from 5/7 until now. Not a bad result for the first version of the new EA Phoenix I think. Maybe we can expect some fireworks tomorrow and Friday. Let's see if <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on"><st1lace w:st="on">Phoenix</st1lace></st1:City> can handle this.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hey Henrdick,

The results seem identical to me except for more profits to Phoenix because of the slight higher lots sizes. Am I missing something? By the way FirebirdG handles the big drop in the majors against the US today very good. The safearea is definitely an asset in volatile times.  What will be the differences between FirebirdG and the upcoming Phoenix apart from the money management?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi Yardie,

If everything goes well I will post Phoenix this weekend and will explain how Phoenix is protecting itself during a volatile market. Will be fun!

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Sounds good looking forward to it .

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Has anyone noticed a "Dead Zone" for Firebird?  I had 16 trades on Monday and Tuesday, but 0 in the last 8 hours.  This seems to happen on a weekly basis, and typically around the middle of the week.

Just wondering if anyone has experienced the same.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Nope I have had 3 trades opened within the last few hours and 12 open and closed within the last 24 hours.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
I've been going over my Account History, and it appears to happen immediately after a reboot, or after I close and reopen a chart.  I'm thinking that when I reopen it, prices are outside of the Divergence envelope.  So, it must wait until prices re-enter the envelope, and breaks it a second time to enter a position.

For example, I rebooted this morning while prices were outside of the envelope.  It has not returned to it in the last 10 hours, therefore, I must wait until it does.

Can anyone else confirm this?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Well it opened a SELL GBPUSD position for me about an hour ago. I assume it would have done the same for you as well.

Hi,

i am a bit confused abt the setting in the 63H version, the setting :

Firebird is havign a rough week this week. I am running 22 wins and 14 losses so far. But with my new settings, I am only down 30 pips on the week so far. Biggest pair loser is USDCHF (-70 pips). Biggest gainer is GBPUSD (+40 pips).

--- 帖子 #433 ---
It was a bit rough today.  For the week, I'm 27 and 4.  If I was doing this live, I think I'd still shut it down prior to a news release that forexfactory has flagged with a red icon.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I know what you mean. But I want to see how it performs in all conditions. The orders that were lost today were actually opened before today's news. Remember the latest version has a safearea built in (which was activated during the news today). I want to see how it performs in all conditions before I take it live. Right now I am 24 wins and 14 losses for the week, Thats about (-5 pips) so far this week. I am contented with this. I dont expect every week to be positive.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi Guys

Approaching the end of week 3 of testing and good old firebird has impressed me. 119 wins with 1 loss. As of Monday(Sunday for some) I'll be increasing the lot size. Floating position continue to range from -$600 to -$1500 depending, so I'm going to keep track of when the range is @ High or Low range with the possibility of closing Floating trades greater the -100 pips, to maximise profits.

Loss/Losses are expected with the release of US data today.

Anyway, I'll keep this test going until week 8 is complete and if results remain on par, I will place it in live.

can you share your firebird you are using right now. thank you. bao80@lycos.com

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Sure, I'm just using the standard Firebird v63G. No mods.

Here it is.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
My USDCHF trades are still open  - I want this thing to go somewhere eventually.

Otherwise, it's doing really well for an EA.

I've closed my EA for the week. With NF tomorrow, I don't want to take the chance of a losing run. For the week, I'm 20-1 with 3 positions still open. So during my 3 week test, I'm 18-0, 21-3, and 20-1. I'll resume on Monday.

Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Is this a live account? because NF could be in your favour.

Mono

--- 帖子 #441 ---
This is a live account.  But after a little research, I don't think it's a good idea to have the EA running during a US session when an economic release is expected to have high volatility. (or a Red flag from FF Homepage)

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Alpha,

Since its a live account its totally understandable. Have you found any sign of  stop hunting, during this.

Thats what I'm worried about when I decide to go live.

Mono

--- 帖子 #443 ---
It's now about one hour after NFP data..  Trades there were open before this time got spiked out at the SL.  So for the week, I'm 28-8.  There have been no trades opened since NFP release which is good.  Firebird is doing a good job of keeping out of new trades during volatility.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I agree. This week was bad for me though 25 wins 17 losses. But I think a lot of the losses was due to the fact I had a tighter SL at 40 pips instead of 50 pips. I have since switched it back to 50 pips (SL 50 TP 25 PIPSTEP 40). The biggest gainer on the week was the USDCAD pair with a net of 120 pips (10 wins 3 losses). The biggest loser was GBPUSD with a net of -110 pips.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
After the NFP data, the 3 trades that I had remaining were stopped out for loss.  So my weekly total is 20-4 with the SL=50 and PipStep=25.  I'm only trading the 3 majors (except JPY).

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Let me get this right AlphaPip....

You netted 300 pips THIS WEEK on three majors (GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDCHF)?

That is amazing......  ARe you using the H02 version or another? Thanks for any advice.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
*EDIT* After reading this, I realized it sounded a bit rude TraderOne. My apologies, didn't mean to come out that way.*

I'm using the v63G version. I disabled the EA at the beginning of this morning's US session because I didn't want to get whipsawed to death. My settings are TP25 SL50 PS25. (20X25=500) (4X50=200) 500-200=300pips profit

Attached is part of my statement. Since this is a live account, I removed some of the details, but you get the idea...

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Thanks Alpha....

I get a little confused since several people are running different versions here.  To me, they are all starting to look promising.  I ran Firebird a few months ago and completely wiped out.  Might have to give it another try due to the successes shown here.

Ol' Don

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I have wiped out a couple demo accounts as well.  I didn't started trading live until I really understood money management.  I never gamble with more than 2% on any trade.  AND YOU MUST KEEP GREED IN CHECK!  Just because you've hit a little winning streak doesn't mean you should gamble 10% on a couple trades, double your lot sizes, or manually enter a larger trade because the system opened a position.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
HEY HENDRICK!  Any update for Pheonix results this week?  How did it handle the last 2 days?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hey Alpha,

Other than not having Firebird running on NFP day, you had it running 24/7 for rest of the week prior to Friday?  How has the overall record been?

Running 63H02 with the settings I had posted in a previous message, I will finish the week 28-8.  There are still two trades open (strangely, the eur/usd, and usd/chf, both sells), that are hovering around break-even.  I'll close them out and call them draws.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Yardie,

What pairs do you have running with Firebird?  I've just been running with the three majors, but saw you had been running it with the USD/CAD too.  My SL has been 42, TP-18, and PS-40.

We're getting there!

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Well I really think this EA has promised. For me personally I would rather it run 24/7 even in bad times to really see what it can do. I am dying to tryout Phoenix next week -- hopefully Hendrick will release it. The we can take advantage of huge runups and downs without fear.

I am using the EA on six pairs -- EURUSD, USDCHF, GBPUSD, EURJPY, USDCAD and USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I would too.  I like "set it and forget it".  Firebird has held its own pretty well.  I ran it 24/7 all week, and still ended up roughly +170 pips for the week.  (28*18) - (8*42).  I look forward to testing Phoenix as well.

--- 帖子 #455 ---

I've been lurking around this thread for the last couple of weeks and finally had a question/thought to add. But first, let me express my appreciation for the extensive efforts by Hendricks and so many others. It is always a joy to find people willing to help each other with an appropiate measure of humility. That's a quality rarely found on message boards. Thanks everyone!

Now down to business.

I've been looking over the statements posted by different ones as they test. Of particular interest to me is the setting people are using for TP and SL. That interest is related to using proper money management with Firebird.

I'd like to use two statements for this thread to frame my thoughts. Mono has been kind enough to continue posting his test. The results are amazing. 126-1 is just insane!. The second one is the last statement from Hendrick of his latest 65H test.

Here's a brief comparison of the two.

For just a moment consider a worst case scenario from this point forward on these two statements.

Mono is floating 18 open trades each with a 300 pip S/L. He's trading .1 lots ($1/pip) in his test. He has a total exposure of $5400 (his floats are down a little over $1,300 on the statement) on $7900 of equity. WOW! At $300, his risking 3.77% of his current equity on each trade.

Hendrick has three open trades each with a 42 pip SL and $5577 of current equity. He is trading .2 lots and so for the USD currency pairs is risking $84 per trade. His exposure is about 4.5% of his current equity. And he is risking about 1.5% per trade.

In the worst case; however unlikely given the high win rate, it seems the larger stop loss is detrimental to the viability of Firebird.

Even in the best case, does not the large S/L limit the profitabiliy of Firebird?

It would seem that an 18/42 order would either win or lose much more quickly than a 20/120 or a 30/300 order.

Would not the larger limits lead to many more floating trades and (given Firebirds' intent of opening multiple trades) a greater exposure during the floating trades?

Further, would not the larger float and SL limit the lot size that one can trade and slow down one's ability to use any compounding effect to increase the lot size?

My thought is that a smaller TP and SL (within reason) for Firebird would not only increase profit but make the EA also more profitable.

Consider the statements again.

Mono booked $3,440.21 (126*30=3780 pips) in gross profits and $-305.34 (1*-300=-300 pips) in loss over 127 trades

Hendrick booked $773.94 (26*18=468 pips) and $-231.83 (3*-42=-126 pips).

Mono cleared then $24.68 per trade and Hendrick $18.69.

But remember, because of the SL's Mono was risking 3.77% per trade to Hendricks' 1.5%.

If we increase Hendricks lot size so that his exposure per trade is equal to Monos' (all of this is using the final equity level in the statement, not the beginning balance. I do realize that, please forgive the touch of laziness.) then Hendrick would have been buying .5 lots (vs. .2) and would have booked

$46.97 per trade (vs. $18.69).

Extrapolating Hendricks statement out to 127 trades using his win rate of 89.66%, He would have gone 114-13. Net profits would have been $6308.09 (127*49.67). That would be well ahead of Mono's pace with lower total exposure (if my assumption is right that a smaller TP and SL would lead to fewer floating trades). That looks to me to be more profitable and safer. I like that combination.

Again, using the assumption that a smaller TP and SL would lead to a quicker turn around on our money and fewer floating trades. As those trades close, with Firebird's apparent high win rate, we could begin increasing lot size much more quickly than if we were carrying a large on-going float. Right?

I think the power of compounding and lower total exposures would even increase the effect as they are not factored in above at all.

The biggest objection in my mind to this is that Hendricks' results might be atypical for Firebird. Others using smaller TP and SL have shown much worse ratios then 26/3. However, I cannot dismiss the thought that Mono's results might also be atypical and while the larger SL would lessen the frequency of bad runs, those runs would be like Armaggedon to your account.

Just my thoughts. Let me know if I'm completely screwy. Thanks again guys (esp. Hendrick and Mono for sharing your statements. They got me to thinking.)

Jonathan

Yes, that's correct.  My Firebird ran 24/7 all week, and I closed it at 00:00GMT prior to the NFP release to allow Firebird time to close my floating positions.  Unfortunately, it still carried 3 positions into the NFP release which got stopped out.  For the week, I was 20-4 while only trading EUR/USD, USD/CHF, GBP/USD.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
do you use M5 or M15 chart for firebird v63G?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Wow those numbers are impressive...and you are getting them all because you use a very wide stop loss hmm...

--- 帖子 #460 ---
15 minute chart. I believe one  person here is using 30 minute chart...dont remember who though.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi jbamaj,

I like your business/analytical approach, very interesting

Im convinced this EA is in the top of the EA's around and with a Money Management function (scaling lot size up and down) it will be even better...

Personally i like the safe path (low TP/SL).

The next weeks/months of testing will defently show us if it holds water..

Have a nice weekend all,

FT

do you know how to make this firebird V63G work on metatrader 3.8?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Bao,

I had an account with InterbankFX version 3.8.  I emailed them and requested them to change my account to a version 4, which they did immediately.  If you have a different broker, I'm sure they could do the same.

Hi guys,<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>

<o></o>

I need only a couple of days before launching Phoenix_v1. It has a lot of nice features, but I want to be certain that they all work as planned.<o></o>

<o></o>

Features:<o></o>

- SafeArea: only place trades during a ranging market<o></o>

- SafePipDistance: another technique to protect you against a volatile market.<o></o>

- Gamble (thanks MarvinSK): there are certain times during the day that all trades are winners. For me (GMT+2) it's from 16-17. With the Gamble function you can increase your Lots during these times.<o></o>

- Surfing: When it's not safe to place trades with <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:City> (counter trend), <st1:City w:st="on"><st1lace w:st="on">Phoenix</st1lace></st1:City> becomes a trend follower. Pick up the wave and let's start surfing!<o></o>

- Money Management: working and a must!<o></o>

- Trailing Stop: Is working<o></o>

- Divergence: use it if you want (I don't like it)<o></o>

- Valid Trade Times: If you want <st1:City w:st="on"><st1lace w:st="on">Phoenix</st1lace></st1:City> to place trades only during certain times, you can set four times a day.<o></o>

- Micro account: Is working<o></o>

- CloseReverse: close trades when the signal changes<o></o>

<o></o>

Can we beat the big guys in Forex with <st1:City w:st="on"><st1lace w:st="on">Phoenix</st1lace></st1:City>? I think we can. <o></o>

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Wauvvv Hendrick,

this is really cool stuff, nice work !!

Thanks for the update, looking forward to test it

FT

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Wow I like the sound of those features. But I thought Firebird open the trades based on divergence?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
No. Divergence works like a kind of filter to keep you out of a trending market.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I use the settings posted on the 1M chart

Mono

--- 帖子 #469 ---
jbamaj,

Nice of you to share your thoughts, and you make some interesting and valid points.

Watching it "Test1 EA" Live over the last 3 weeks, the floating positions range from -$600 to -$1800. The floats need to better managed. Now in saying that what I'm looking at is NOT the SL, but the SWAP. Example I have 1 open trade from the first week, which has a swap of -$24. Now even if that trade turns into a winner, its a loser for me, so what I am thinking is to close floating trades when swap get past -$11. I am a beleiver of give your trade a chance to win, thats why the 300 SL, but only to a certain point.

Couple of other things to note from the Test1 data is,

1. Pips booked has decreased each week.

2. Floats have increased each week.

3. Trades have decreased week.

Now a question for you guys, Lets look into the future, IF a million people are using this EA with the same setting, will the market become more choppy? If it does then will Firebird continue to succeed?

Mono

--- 帖子 #470 ---
It is highly unlikely that a million people will start using this EA. Even so, chances are that the transactions would be so small relative to liquidity if the Forex market that it wouldnt make a difference.

--- 帖子 #471 ---

Mono - big difference in the length of trades in week3. I think the pheonix with the surf function will normalise such variability.

Tomorrow I will start 2 accounts: one with Firebirdv63G (24 hours) and one with the final version of Phoenix. If after 2 or 3 days Phoenix has the same or better (I hope) results than Firebird I will open a new thread and will make Phoenix available. Let's wait and see!

Hello! When you will open a new thread, give please on her reference. We all with impatience wait when you will lay out Phoenix.

Starting the week at 3-2 with 2 floating losses.  Not a good start.

Hendrick - How's Pheonix looking?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Same here off to a bad start this week. I am 2 wins and 2 losses with a few floating right now.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Look at GBPUSD. Today the highest High at 1.8501 and the lowest Low at 1.8366. A difference of 135 pips. It's not the right market for Firebird. <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on"><st1lace w:st="on">Phoenix</st1lace></st1:City> did slightly better, but could have done much better if I used the right settings. Where did it go wrong: <st1lace w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:City></st1lace> is looking at price movements for the last 2 hours (default). If the movement of price exceeds a certain limit (60 pips) it stops placing trades. If  I had used 5 hours instead of 2 hours I could have prevented some losers. The Gamble function works great! All these weeks Firebird/Phoenix is placing the right trades between 16:00 and 17:00. I've now increased my Lots for this time from 2 to 4. Lets see what tomorrow will bring.

My version H is OK today but version G is sinking.

any ideas why no trades on these?

Just read on, on the first page Hendrick and Bigballer are discussing about the exact same issue.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Do you see the little happy face on all your charts that the EA is activated on? In the rtop right hand corner there should be the word "Firebird" with a happy face indicating its set to live trading.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Yardie,

yes I am, all compiled and auto-trade on with smiley face. working for USDCHF but no others. I'll try reinstalling on a new MT4.

thanks

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Remember folks, this thing only trades when it meets the conditions.  You might not have a trade on every pair all day.  I haven't. I suggest to relax and let the EA do the work. You don't have to do anything but once in while check in.

It's called automatic trading!  :-)

--- 帖子 #491 ---
hi guys,

thanks for your work on FIREBIRD, it's awesome! Actually, it's the best (for my Trading Style right now) Trading System I have ever seen.

Which crosses are you trading?

Right now, I am just trading EUR/USD and GBP/USD but I still don't why only those two

BTW, is it better to trade crosses with your accountCurrency - that means, if you fund your account with EUR, is it better to trade EUR/* or */EUR than USD/* or something?

Well, FB is doing good right now, 12-0 just within the last 15.5 hours! Crosses were EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD. However, what about a trailingStop in FB because the trade in USDCAD could have been about 60 Pips instead, it was just 18 in one bar (!)(18 is the takeProfit of FBH02, right?). In addition, there were some situations on EURUSD where a TrailingStop could have brought some more pips, too.

I mean, we can just take 18 TrailingAct & a few pips TrailingStep.

Maybe I am missing something right now, just tell me

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I currently only trade EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/CHF.  During my demo account testing, the JPY crosses did not fair so well.  How is your USD/CAD?  Also, is anyone trading EUR/CHF or EUR/GBP?  What are your results for those crosses?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Just added EUR/GBP on Friday.  1-0 on it so far using 65h and 18/42.  1 float that is currently down 7 pips.

Jonathan

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Well, my USD/CAD only had one trade so far. But it caught a move of 80 pips right in the beginning, so it's 1-0. It was really cool, it placed the order and - boom - the next bar it was out of the trade again with 18 pips win.

I am 9 wins and 5 losses so far this week. I am doing USDCAD EURUSD GBPUSD USDCHF EURJPY and USDJPY

Hi Guys

FireBird Test1 continues its amazing run at a 143-1 win/loss and the float is down. Float was down to -$550 yesterday.

Also started 3 other tests -

Firebird using 15Min settings

and

started new Firebird test to compare with Pheonix ( thanks Hendrick) like for like.

Results will be posted in a couple of days.

I have dropped Firebird for Phoenix.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I'm still testing Firebird version H.  This week it is doing quite well so far, and we can set the trading times just like Phoenix.  I'm going to be testing both versions for a while longer.

Ol' Don

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Mono, can you please post your settings and pairs and whether running 24 hours?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I'm still running Firebird on demo accounts.  It's done well in the past, and see no reason to stop using it at least at this time.  Using version G, I'm 9-3 for the week so far using AlphaPip's settings.  Using version H, I'm 15-6 using my settings from a previous post.  (It's pretty much the default settings).

--- 帖子 #506 ---
If you're still 9-3 using my settings, then you are beating me.....  I'm 14-12 after today's Trade Deficit Announcement.  In a previous post I had decided to avoid trading on "red flag" days.  I might go back and research which Eco reports effect Firebird the most.  According to FF, this morning's report was an "orange flag" so I was running during the announcement.  Prior to that, I was 12-4.  Just wondering if certain reports effect it more often, regardless of FF's perspective.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Come to find out my pc rebooted itself after another windows update, so it wasn't running today.  I guess mine wouldn't have done too well today either.   I would think that the US trade balance would be considered a red flagged event instead of orange.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Actually Phoenix really shined through todays report. The surf function really did its job. Time to switch Alphapip .

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Looks like we are using simmilar settings.  What was your starting balance - $10,000?

I didn't have nearly as many trades as you did but have also had a good run for the month.  I forget the number of trades but they were all winners.  My account was close to $15,000 and the floating loss was aboud $400.  Unfortunately my account expired before i got to save the results.

I will continue with the same settings.  My settings are as follows:

Balance started at $6153.21 trading 6 pairs, and its been running 24/7 for nearly 4 weeks. Currently @ 162/1 W/L ratio with floats @ -$550

Mono

--- 帖子 #511 ---
How may lots are you using? $ per lot I mean.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Its a mini account which has a leverage of 200:1

Couple of other things to add is, I deliberately started testing Firebird on a non news week, because EA's like this need a week to settle into a routine. So I try to build up funds, in preperation for large floats.

The market will always go up & down, its just a matter of how long are you willing to wait till its in your favour. This is why my stoploss is at 300.

Currently I'm running 5 test & 1 live system.

3 are firebirds with w/l's of 162/1,  52/1 and 21/0

2 are Phoenix with w/l's of  40/27 & 10/0

1 live @ 18/0

And I plan on starting a new firebird test @ market open next week.

Mono

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Mono, these are exceptional firebird results.  Can you share your settings for the 3 firebirds?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi Mono,

Are you still using the same settings as was in the attachment in post #501?  Thanks.  Those are awesome results!!!

--- 帖子 #515 ---
yep settings are the same. Also testing a 15min 15tp 150 sl and 15 pipstep setting. Will post results when market is closed.

Mono

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Your using the settings from post #501 on a 30 minute chart correct?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I've tested a G version 15 min 15tp 120sl 15ps.  Unfortunately I was using a platform that expired.  Results were very good for a long time, but got killed a few weeks back when we hit a very strong trending market.  The low pipstep killed it.  Maybe your 150 sl will be better.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Guys

End of week 4 of testing and results (Firebird 30-300) are showing that this is a boring EA. All it wants to do is win.

W/L Record stands at 171/1 with -$600 in floats.

Stats for the week

Trades Open = 42

Trades Closed = 45

Trades Open & Closed = 31

Floats = 11

I have also started another test ( Firebird 30-300 Test2) with the same setting, just to see if its a fluke. And W/L results are 29/0 with 14 Floats

Another Test is based on 15Min settings ( Firebird 15-150) and the W/L results are 65/1 with 12 Floats.

I will be starting another test (Firebird 300-30 Test3) with same settings @ market open and running it for 4 weeks, but with Money Management and a close trade feature(yet to be determined).

I have also been running 2 tests of Phoenix, but results and settings will be placed in the Phoenix thread.

All Results and settings are below.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Continues to impress.  I must confess you have me running a similar test of my own (although I'm using Phoenix 1.0 as the EA).  A little over 2 days in and I'm 10-0 (300 pips booked) with a float of around -150 pips.

If I were doing this as a money maker, I would sure be tempted to close out some of the negative float just to control exposure.  Any thoughts about that?  I know your results are so impressive that may not be something you thought of.  Its hard to have any moments of worry when you've gone almost 200-1.  I'm still a touch skeptical that given the right market conditions the draw down could be hugh.

Along those lines, have you noticed either of these two things?

1)  What is the longest a trade has stayed negative before turning around?

2)  What is the largest negative draw-down you've had a on trade that reversed and closed out positive?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Never mind on that question, its in your statment.  Looks like it was order #1321232.  Open on 6/30 and closed on 7/14.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hi jbamaj

Yeah, Im looking at closing trades based on the swap rate. i.e. if my swap has taken 50% of expected profits, then I look to close the trade and cop the loss. I have to think about how to automate it. If you've got any ideas let me know and I'll code it.

I also have been testing the Phoenix EA and have similar results to you. I've posted results in the Phoenix thread.

Mono

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Does anyone have any ideas on how to reduce the float?

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I think the only way to reduce the float, is to reduce the TP and SL.  But by doing so, you reduce your returns.  Mono is somewhere around a billion wins and one loss on 30/300, but I'm at 63-16 using 25/50.  But I never carry more than 100 pips in float.

--- 帖子 #524 ---

Hello bigballer,

I cant see your Firebird EA, can you please show me what program is comparible with it?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hi Tri...

Bigballer knows the least about this Ea. He started the thread, but it has evolved. You will just have to read theentire thread to get a complete understanding... Thanks and have fun, it is a great thread he started.. Scott

--- 帖子 #529 ---
I have download the Firebird Indicator from post #115 & it is in

the MetaTrade 4 indicator list, but it will not load on the chart.

I can go to the settings section & change the line colors & the settings,

but it will not load on the chart.   What have I done wrong?  Thanks

for any help.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
HI Ace,

Just to verify, you downloaded the indicator and not the EA.  The mq4 file must reside in the \experts\indicators directory under your trade platform program, and not in the experts directory.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
And also make sure the percent is not set too high, otherwise it will be outside the visible range on your chart.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Thanks to you both for that help.  I did have the setting too high.  After

making the setting change only two lines show up on the chart.   The red

& blue are all that moves to the chart.  What could cause this?  Tks again.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
That's all your supposed to have with the indicator, one red and one blue line.  It's just a visual indicator that shows what the Firebird EA is doing.  If you're looking for the EA that's a different download and there are a few versions floating around.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi Guys

Firebird reached its 200th milestone and continues its impressive record, which stands at 202/1. Floats did reach -$2200 but a few days later came down to -$750, picking up wins along the way.

Mono

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Very impressive

FT

--- 帖子 #536 ---
That's pretty impressvie. You're running this on 30 min charts? -$2200 float is pretty big though trading just .10 or .20 contracts.

I have to tell you though, a couple months ago I was testing with a large stop as well. We hit 2 hard trending days and the pipstep and large stop killed it. You're pipstep at 30 is larger than I was using though, so that may help.  Looks like you've just passed the month mark too.  How much did the account start with?

You're definitely having a good ride though I have to say.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
The main thing this this EA and its settings is the lot size. You require a $5000 account trading 0.1 lots (mini), when trading 6 currencies. When your equity doubles then increase your lots size to 0.2. It seems to double every 4 weeks.

We all know that all pairs behave differently, so what this EA needs is some fine tuning. My target is to have about 50 trades per pair per month. Currently only GBP/USD acheives this. So some pipstep reduction is required for some pairs so as to increase entries. (I'll do some stats and get back to you).

I know your thinking that i'm mad trying to increase enteries, which will increase floats, and when that day comes your account is going to go BYE BYE.

We will see.

Mono

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Your MA timeframe setting is 30, but you're running it on 1 min charts?  And I notice your envelope is twice as large as usual at .1.  Interesting.  And so when your equity doubles again you'll increase to .3 or .4?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Can you post a .gif of the graph that comes with the statement?  Thx.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
When my equity reaches 15000, I will increase my lots size to 0.3, at next market open, 20000 = 0.4 and so on and so on. thats my plan.

Why next market open? I dont like changing settings mid week.

I've tried various money managers and wasn't happy, so I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible.

Also, started new firebird test with each pair configured differently, we'll see how that goes.

Mono

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Here you go

--- 帖子 #542 ---
do you use this firebird on M5 chart  or M30 charts?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
All my tests are done on 1min charts.

with the settings shown in the zip.

Mono

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Thx.  I notice that some of your swaps are quite high.  There's a couple instances in your open trades where the swap fees are pretty high compared to a 30 pip profit target.

If you hold on to those trades for much longer, very soon the swap fees will outweigh potential profit.  What's your plan in those instances?

--- 帖子 #545 ---
You are correct, I have coded into another firebird test, swap management where if the swap gets to a certain level, start looking to close it at the lowest losing margin.

Example. If I have a buy trade and my swap limit is set to -$11, when my trade <= -$11 it then waits for CCI(377) on 30min setting to reach -180 then closes the trade. If the trade is not closed by the next day the next CCI level is set to -160 then -140 and so on until it closes.

Mono

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Sweet.  Good work.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Mono,

Impressive.

This could be one way to control the float. you can control the float by limiting the max open orders per chart. I used 2 below. This will reduce the overall number of trades, but will help your exposure.

Put this in the input section of the code.

extern int MaxOpenOrders = 2; //max open orders per chart

Put this somewhere up near the top, under the MAIN PROGAM LOOP.

if( MyOrdersTotal() >= MaxOpenOrders) return(0);

Then compile the EA.

Good luck,

Wackena

Guys'n'gals,

today I got a cable trade closed by the server for a loss of $740, with the comment "Firebirdv63G(99.5%)".

Is this a margin call that erased 3 days of no losses? If so that's a good lesson learnt!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
We need more info, could you post your account statement. It sounds like a margin call. You require equity with this system, about $1000 per currency on a mini, trading 0.1 lots.

I've got 6 firebird demos running and not one has had a loss.

Mono

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hi boys, please can you help me ?

I have copied ***mq4 to /experts/indicators to my Metatrader folder, in Metatrader I have firebird, but I cant use it. "cry"

Please can you help me what I did wrong ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #554 ---
It should be in the experts folder not the indicators folder. Close and reopen MT4 to see it listed under Experts on the left.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I know, I have it there in experts indicators, but when I want to move it into chart nothing happend

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Mono, I think I found the answer: V63G. Please correct if it's wrong.

*********************************

Mono -

I've been reading the threads and the record is too strong to be ignored. I'd like to test it but I forgot to log down which version of the Firebird you're testing with these settings. Can you please either post or send me a link to that EA?

Thanks.

FW

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Yep correct version, placed on 1min charts, setting are posted in zipfile. Will also post test results of specific currency configuration later on in the week.

Mono

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Thanks for that, I'll keep it it mind. The way I see it at the moment is that floats are your friend (Not so much as the float size, but the trade numbers).

I expect my float size to increase as my lotsize increases.

I am patiently waiting for my next loss.

Mono

--- 帖子 #559 ---
sorry, couuld you?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Seems to me that limiting the number of trades each chart can open only delays an issue.  Unless by delaying the opening of allows the EA to get to more favorable market conditions (which is possible, but I have no guess about it), the percentages are still the same.  By limiting the trades, don't you also limit the number of positive trades you close?

Jonathan

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Is there a VT version of the firebird EA?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Mono - I've ditched the demo that had the margin call and recommenced with 0.1 lots on 8 pairs with your settings. Maybe I should shed a couple of pairs since the equity is 5k.

Are you trading 24hrs? I'm generally switching my system off at 10pm GMT.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
It shouldnt be in the indicators folder.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Firebird continues on its merry way, halfway into the 6th week @ 237-1

Week1 = 1320 pips

Week2 = 1230

Week3 = 930

Week4 = 1350

Week5 = 1110

Week6 = 630 so far

Currently averaging over 1100 pips per week

I have also started to test Firebird with individual currency configuration and after 4 days, is at 58-0, using 9 currencies.

Very impressive Mono thanks for keeping us posted. I am still havign problems using EAs with StrategybuilderFX.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Now, that is a nice post, Mono -- all the relevant info is there. Thank you. I was always unsure of your settings because you have MA timeframe set to 30, yet you're on 1 minute charts. I don't know why but that just seems like it would cause errors, but obviously it's working.

Swap fees getting big.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Switch to another broker, all my testing is done with fxdd.

Mono

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Does FXDD have an unlimited Demo? I didnt know FXDD use Metatrader. Whats the floating looking like as in floating pips?

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I dont know if its unlimited, but i've been with them for a few months now without any problems.

As for the float it ranges between -$500 and -$2500. This is why you need a healthy balance to start with, about $1000 per currency, by my calculation.

Mono

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Did you ever implement that cci trigger to help with exits when the swap grows too large?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Still in forward test, might be a while.

Mono

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I notice that first swap listed is pretty big.  I would hate to have to manually close that and force a loss with such a great record.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Thats the first test using original EA. Should have been closed when swap was at -$12. And a few other too.

But, no intervention what so ever. Lets see where it goes.

Mono

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Agreed, no intervention is perfoming amazingly well so far.  The floating losses can be scary but so far they have just been floating.

i would if I could but - this is no excuse - my demo expired yesterday and I can't access the history.

I use the same settings as mono but on a 30 min chart - EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/JPY.

So far no losses in 2 months.  First month yielded just over 40% profit and last month 36%

I am using strategybuilder now so will not have the expiry problem.  Sorry I can't do anymore than that.

Only testing these three pairs?

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Mono, have you been watching your margin levels? Demo accounts won't close positions if the margin fails. There's no limit to the number of pipstep entries, and so open orders can be very many.  I'm wondering if you've noticed at any time the potential for a margin call or automatic closure.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
I had a margin call but was trading 0.5 lots on 10 pairs. it's been fine using 0.1 lots on 6 pairs with a 10k demo.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Thx.  I thought I had read in one of the posts that .2 lots would be okay for a 10k demo.  Wat do you think?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hello MONO. I have a question. Whether you are going to go out on real. And what from experts you will use with what setings?

--- 帖子 #585 ---
today's performance with v36G SL300 TP30.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Yep, I'm not surprised, Firebird requires about $1000 per pair trading 0.1 mini lots. You could of gotten away with trading 10 maybe 11 pairs at that ratio, but at 0.5 lots on a 10k demo its margin call time.

A couple of things that I do, never change setting or add pairs during trading, meaning wait for the market to close, apply your changes for the new week ahead.

The other thing is do not look at your balance when making a decision, look at your equity, then make changes on weekend.

Mono

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Nope, haven't been anywhere near a margin call, the highest float that ive seen is -$2550 (but I dont watch it all the time, could have been higher) . The other thing is that it hasn't opened more that 20 positions. I need to go through the code and check if there is restrictions.

Mono

--- 帖子 #588 ---
I actually have. My first attempt, I got greedy, overcommitted and got margin called (byebye $180). So lesson learned, go slow and build.

I started my second attempt last week on a micro account chucked $200 in it, trading 3 pairs, with a 31-0 WL. Floats are small, profits are small, but at least I wont get margin called. Thats why I set myself rules to follow.

Mono

Good work Mono - have you tried pheonix with crazy settings yet?

And are you trading Friday's and big news days?

Thank you Mono. Not so small. At you of about 45-50% income. And this only for 1 week. What tuning do you have for expert?

If  farther there will be all it is so good, you will multiply the account in 2 times each month.

Did you try a different setings for every currency? And what exactly do you change in setings?

Does FXDD provides micro account? As far as I know the minimum deposit of their mini account is $500. If you have $200 in your balance I think you will use lot size of less than 0.1 micro lot ($1000 contract) for 3 currency pairs. Please explain.

BTW Phoenix with 30-300 also doing well but much bigger float.

Thank you so much for posting all of your settings, the EA, and which pairs and how much equity needed to do this.  I set up a new demo, with INterbankFX, 5,000 mini, 200:1 leverage.  I put the EA you posted, along with the settings and chart setups for the pairs you outlined.  I hope to have similar results    Thanks for keeping everybody informed with your test results.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Mono - any reason you are avoiding EURCHF and EURGBP which are more ranging pairs?

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Those pairs generally move very slowly. Sort of like the NZDUSD and AUDUSD (somethimes).

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi cgldsmth

I have got a another test where I'm trading 10 pairs (above included), each configured differently. Its results are @ 85-1 after the first week. I post results and settings @ the end of this week.

Mono

--- 帖子 #606 ---
85-1 is still impressive that works out to about 2250 net pips.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi Yardie

Each pair has a different settings. Pips made was 1620 (includes a sl), so at this early stage we a probably looking at about 1800-2000 pips per week(rough estimate).

Mono

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Mono are any of those pairs the GBPJPY? I have been thinking of adding it. Right now I am doing 8 pairs. Just added the NZDUSD. I am not a big fan of pairs with big spreads though (like the GBPJPY).

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I agree, I hate large spread. I only deal with pairs where spread is under 6.

These are my 10 pairs

EUR/USD

GBP/USD

USD/CHF

EUR/JPY

USD/JPY

USD/CAD

AUD/USD

EUR/CHF

EUR/GBP

AUD/JPY

Mono

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Mono does Firebird has a MaX Order setting? I am seeing on my chart "Max OrdersOpen = 7" and that is exactly how many positions I have open at the moment. The PIPstep is not working either. Is this because of the maxorder setting?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hi Yardie

Maxorder does nothing, its there for show.

Pipstep works, its just got to meet all the criteria before it enters, like outside the evelope, direction and RVI.

Mono

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Ah Thanks. I always thought it was automatic the pipstep thing...and all other factors had no play.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Mono, ru using H or G version and whats the difference

--- 帖子 #614 ---
These results are just amazing. Wow, just think if these were $100 pips..You could retire. Approx average wise, how many trades should firebird be opening per day. I have the G version but it does not seem to opening any trades....Phoenix is opening a few here and there.............

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I am using the EA in Post #601, all files are included in the Zip File, work's fine using the Neuimex Demo Server (where spreads are not as good as other Forex Dealers).

(5) postions closed since open this week on .01 lots up $137.62.  current open postions (5) drawdown about $34.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Alsup I was using the G version, it open a few trades then stop. Went back to the H version that Mono is using. So far so good. I have 7 floating and 1 closed at the moment. Flaoting is only about 15 pips in the red.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Not sure how much it matters, but I'm pretty sure Mono is using G version.  That's the version he's always posted anyway.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I got it mixed up. I was using the H and went back to the G.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Im using G

Mono

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I am 3-0 so far today a very tight ranging day. But I have about 10 floating for about -20 net pips.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
I am also 3-0 today, but I have 7 floating with -177 pips.  Is everyone closing their positions at the end of the week or carrying over?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
TX Mono and Yardie...Appreicate all u guys r doing for this thread.....Its helping all of come closer to our dreams to live the life we were meant to live....TX again

Kevin Alsup

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Let them go and wait for the market to turn, your only concern should be the swap. If the swap has taken half your profits, then start looking at closing positions. If the swap is in your favour, just sit back and make profit on the swap.

Mono

--- 帖子 #624 ---
I noticed that in the code the fast_price and slow_price say price_open.

But in your settings u have them listed as 1....Does it matter?????????

TX Alsup

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Also, I'm in the USA mountain time zone..Is there any setting I need to change for it to trade properly...TX again

Sorry, for the many qeustions, but just want to get it right........................

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I loaded this version and I think it might be corrupted....All it would do is keep logging my equity balance about every few seconds or so in the experts tab at the bottom......????? any Ideas

would not open trades

--- 帖子 #627 ---
I just started again with Firebird this week so cannot comment about trades carried over from last week. I am 7-0 with -64 pips floating loss now. I have added CHFJPY AUDJPY and CADJPY to my list to make it 10 pairs being traded.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
What does it show in the journal itself Alsup?

--- 帖子 #629 ---
so far so good. anyone gonna let it run durng NFP?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Nice statement

In your statement, it quotes : " Firebird Version D" - what version is that, or is it same settings as 63G ?

Thanks in advance,

FT

--- 帖子 #631 ---
same settings, not sure why it says that.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Mono,

With these incredible results, we can start trading with real money using this EA?  (i  will continue  my demo test  for a longer time, but i want your opinion)

--- 帖子 #633 ---
put it in experts file, not indicators file............................

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Yes , could someone please post a current WORKING, bug free version..  The version from post #601 seems to be corrorupted....Not sure...... But a fresh version posted would be a great help.....Appreciate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At least it would help to determine if some else is wrong..........TX

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Alsup1955 I'm experience the same behaviour , i put EA on 30min EURUSD and GBPUSD with settings 30-300 found in the zip file posted by Mono. No trade starts , only my account equity is logged into Experts tab. I'm using NorthFinance broker.

May be problem is due to some warnings that I receive when i try to compile this EA :

Function "CloseTheseTrades" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file

Function "CloseLoosingTrades" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file

Function "iFXAnalyser" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file

Function "GoalCheck" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file

Function "GetSlippage" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file

Someone can post working EA Firebird v63G ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Been running Firebird since Sunday Night on Neuimex Demo Server, currently as of Tuesday Afternoon here in US have (21) closed postions for profit of $540, however the Float is rising now (8) open postions with loss (float of about ($320), seems to be getting larger.

--- 帖子 #637 ---

You know it takes awhile sometimes to enter a trade.  It doesn't just trade for the hell of it.  It took me over 24 hours for my first trade to open on the 4 pairs I am trading, now it is doing fine but has closed all trades.  Waiting for more.

Patience and let the EA work.  We can go do something else!

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Look in your experts tab at the bottom...is it logging  your equity balance every few seconds? I have Phoenix running just fine, and it is not logging the balances like that...So thats why I think it is corrupted....

[quote=traderone]

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Yes , exactly every few seconds EA write a row with my equity balance

--- 帖子 #640 ---
As far as I understand Firebird method enter an buy/sell order when price hit upper or lower band. Now I'm looking at my chart and price hit at least 3 times and no order was entered, may be did I not understand as this method works?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
No.  I checked my journal and I don't have entries like that.  NOt on Firebird G version anyway.

Here is the exact EA I am running now.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
I plan to make it run 24/5. I want to see how it does during NFP should be interesting. But I am using demo now so who knows? Probably wont use live for another 3 to 6 months. I think thats sufficient time to see how the EA performs in all situations.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I think the G version uses the divergence setting of FirebirdD.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Thanks Traderone, i tried again with same result  Another thing that i see on top of chart is 'bad hours' label , i'm using setting as Mono used with openinghour=0 and closinghour=23 i'm wondering why that label is printed. I don't know if GMT = 0 and DST = 0 is right ? Nortfinance broker demo seems to be GMT+3 (i'm at GMT+2).

--- 帖子 #645 ---
float way up again today, but still 7 TPs and equity rising nicely.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Are you guys using another EA along with FirebirdG? This may be the problem.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I am having pretty much the same results. The float goes up and down I am not worried about it.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
yes yardie, last week float got near 2k then was 120$ yesterday. I'm not quite as disciplined as Mono and am altering the lot size manually every day depending on the size of the float, so reduced to 0.2 for tomorrow.

think this EA could be a winner but need to see what it does with strong trends, I think a lot depends on how far ahead it can get in ranging markets, which are after all 80% of the time.

friday will be very interesting.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I am testing it with 0.1 lots only. I am being very conservative and use .1 lot per 10K. If I go live I will probably do the same as well.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
I would be very cautious, ONLY GAMBLE WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.

My testing is not over yet, and there are new test results and settings, that will be posted on the weekend.

If you still want to proceed with a live account account, I suggest you start with micro account and start the EA on a non-news week.

I have started a live micro and its at 44-0, trading 3 pairs, but the float is very high at the moment. I wouldnt call it successful yet.

Mono

--- 帖子 #651 ---
To get rid of the bad hours, set closinghour=24, so firebird can run 24 hrs.

Mono

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Those warning are not errors, the compiler is removing functions that are not used.

Mono

--- 帖子 #653 ---
the words of cauton are wise ones. I am very concerned what would happen in big trends. would only start with micro lots if I go live.

still, it seems one of the best EAs out there right now.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Thx Mono

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I also have a live micro account, but I'm only trading the GBP/USD.  Only up for 4 days and currently 7-0 with 2 floating losses.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
and you have to pay a lot of swap points, its interesting that you create an interest free account

anyway, thanks for the reply, i will continue my testing, and i am getting very positives results, lets see

--- 帖子 #657 ---
What are the best 5-6 pairs to trade this with? Can whoever has used Firebird enough post the pairs that got the best results in order?

Thanks!

PS: Just started testing it live. 6 consecutive profit trades yesterday for $158 trading 3 pairs at 0.1 lots. (5 floating currently 4 in negative)

PPS: I read a lot of postswhere people got bad results backtesting Firebird (even though backtesting isn't reliable anyway) But I did my own backtesting just for the hell of it, and over the last 4 months on the USDCHF it didn't produce one loss. (using Mono's settings) Just wanted to share that as well....

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Well, GBP/USD had the most wins, but carried the most float, too.  EUR/USD and USD/CAD both perform pretty similarly, with USD/CHF not far behind.  Personally, I do not trust the JPY crosses as they seem to perform the worst.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I can concur. Performance so far this week as been awesome about 33 wins and 0 losses with about 300 pips floating loss (so net about 700 pips in 2.5 days).

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Hey Yardie ru letting them close them selfs at the t/p...I'm having a hard time letting them run...When I see a profit of 5 or more pips , Im manully closeing them my self.......Probley losing lots of pps.............

--- 帖子 #661 ---
LOL whats the point then Alsup? Better to make them run...Yes you are missing on a lot of pips. UNless you are using a live account..if so taking profits may not be such a bad idea. I dont plan to go live for another couple of months...I want to do at least 3 months of test before I go live...I know it will be tempted to go earlier, but I have to fight the temptation hehe.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Yeah LOL,  that tempaton is brutal......I'm thinking about going live here within the next couple weeks.   Even closing these early, i'm making great pipage......Just sit here and scalp the market.....Yeah baby............

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Personally, I have been running a live account.  Even though it is Micro, I still allow it to ride out the profits.  The results speak for themselves.  Exercise patience, and allow the system to work for you.  Besides, what's the point of an EA if you have to manually close deals to secure profits.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Finally yesterday night an order was entered and booked a good +30 pips and  2 trade are still running

Yardie i see that you are performing very well with these method , are you using Mono settings? Which timeframe and pairs? Divergence true or false?

thx

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I am using all of MOno's 30-300 settings posted in post #603 or somewhere around there.

Timeframe 1 minute (with 30 minute EA setting), Divergence = True. 10 pairs. EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD,  USDJPY, and some other Yen crosses -- EUR, AUD, CAD and CHF.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
For those that are testing Mono's 30-300 settings, what are your plans for the next 2 days?  I, for one, am very concerned going into these announcements long the USD.  I have 3 open positions floating long USD and I expect both announcements to be dollar bearish.

Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Actually I am looking forward to the next few days to see how Firebird performs through them. Then again I dont have a live account going like you so I have nothing to lose. I think the news will be either neutral or $ bullish. I also have a feeling that the NFP data on Friday will beat expectations.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Yardie.... great results.  Mine has only traded 5 times this week... all winners, but I'm only trading 4 pair.

I am really interested in the pairs you use.  Could you perhaps post a statement so we could analyse which of these pairs seem to be the most favorable?  Thanks for any advice.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Ur exactly right....I'm focing myself to ride these out...But I tell u, its tough not to close them when u have 10 or 15 pip banked....But I'll take your guys advice and pinch myself when I get the ergre to close...............

TX

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hey alpha

Who's your broker, and ru happy with them...I'm using Coes, and manully trading live. Have not added the firebid to my live account.....I wish I would have, I took my live account from $1600 to $23.....I must admit I really messed up...But I have definatly learned alot over the last 2 months...My disiplne is definately lacking right now..But I will take a step back and evaluate and bounce back.........

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Here are the book pips since MOnday

EURUSD - 150

USDCHF - 150

USDCAD - 150

GBPUSD - 90

AUDUSD - 90

NZDUSD - 90

EURJPY - 60

AUDJPY - 60

CHFJPY - 60

USDJPY - 30

CADJPY - 30

Divide each number by 30 to get the number of winning trades.

Hi Guys

Well, Firebird finally lost its second trade and the W/L stands at 277-2.

Its been a very quiet week, after booking 1500 pips last week, its currently at -30 pips for this week.

While trading at 0.1 lots the floats ranged from -500 to -2500, now that i'm trading at 0.2 lots, I expect floats to range from -1000 to -5000.

The other thing I discovered, whilst going through the code, is that putting the EA on the 1min chart does make a difference, not on the envelope, but for divergence. The divergence function works on the chart you are on, and takes into account the fast_period, fast_price, slow_period, slow_price and divergence_limit.

Here is the code

maF1=iMA(Symbol(),0,F_Period,0,MODE_SMA,F_Price,mypos);

maS1=iMA(Symbol(),0,S_Period,0,MODE_SMA,S_Price,mypos);

dv1=maF1-maS1;

maF2=iMA(Symbol(),0,F_Period,0,MODE_SMA,F_Price,mypos+1);

maS2=iMA(Symbol(),0,S_Period,0,MODE_SMA,S_Price,mypos+1);

if (Use_V63D_Divergence)

{

dv2=((maF1-maS1)-(maF2-maS2));

}

else

{

dv2=maF2-maS2;

}

return(dv1-dv2);

Basically, what it does is, it doesn't place any/many trades during high volitity periods (like news events).

Anyway, we should see more movement from today, as interest rate news from the UK & EU and of course the NFP tomorrow. Currently Firebird is loaded up for a US favourable result,(maybe firebird know something we dont) or else more losses are expected.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Thanks Yardie.  Very interesting.  I wonder why my Cable and EURUSD haven't traded nearly that much starting sunday night?  Oh well, the vagaries of FXDD I suppose.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I am netting almost 1000 pips so far this week. I am surprised you are having a different result.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Did u start your test this week? Firebird takes into account your open trades and I copped a 300 pip loss. Plus I think your trading 10 pairs to my 6. Can u post your results?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I started on JUly 31st. I posted my results above so far. I dont want to post my statement because it has my real name on it. My floating loss so far is -245 and pippage book is about 1000.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
HAHAHA......ok Yardie...

Here's what I do, Open the statement in notepad, and do a search and replace of your name ( ctrl-h), and save it.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Thanks for the tip. Here you go. From August 1st.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
have 3 pages of posts disappeared?

firebird was roasted today by NFP. All profit wiped out. Lesson is not to trade the week of NFP

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Firebird is getting roughed up this week by the GBPUSD. Already suffered 2 losses.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Looks like it. I think GBPUSD is the pair we should avoid. Its risk / reward seem to be very poor. Two of my losses are from it. ANd about $800 of my $1200 floating loss at the moment. I only booked 210 pips from it this week.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
mono's two losses are also on cable. adjusting the setting for it or dropping it is worth a look.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
It's not my case , may be i'm lucky

1 trade closed on gpbusd on 2 Aug = +30 pips

then no more trade opened on gpbusd (divergence is always more than limit 0.002)

Today was another good day for me , +46 pips gained on news release :

sell USDCHF : +30 pips

sell USDCAD : +16 pips

so far i'm 8-0 (win-loss)

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Of course, just gave his statment a quick count so my number may be off 1 or 2, but he's got 72 winners on cable. Still up almost 1600 pips on it.

72 out of his 277 winners.  pretty big piece of the pie.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
about the same here.  The problem was not trades that opened during NPF, but trades that were already open going into it.  Cable had been bad for over the last two days.  And my 4 largest negatives were already on it.  One of those just stopped out and one more is close to it.

Not sure what to do about it.  I'm still in the black and if the report goes the other way, all is good.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
I will see how things go next week and make a decision about the pair then. Right now out of the 10 pairs its consumed 1300 pips (600 loss and 700 floating). Thats a big chunk for one pair out of ten.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
I wonder how comes you are getting a different result?

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I'm not sure about that , may be divergence could be affected by different timeframe chart settings (i'm using TF30 on both chart and EA).

Edit : in the meantime another +30 pips booked on sell usdcad

I ran Firebird this week since Sunday Night on Neuimex Demo Server all of Mono settings with the (6) curriencies using 0.1 Lots several hours before the Report on Friday I had closed trades of about $950 and the float was about $420, thus if I would have closed out all postions for the week at that time I would have made a decent profit for the week of about $520

However by holding on thru the report I would have been up $700 in closed trades HOWEVER the Float was negative ($1,300) thus a losing week of about $600, are you willing to lose this much money on a report, I don't think so. risking this much on a report which can go 50-50 that is a very poor risk reward. Also GBP\USD as discussed made up for alot of the losses and large float stopped out trades involved this currency.

Basically how I feel this should be traded if you start the EA fresh on Sunday and that after say 3-4 day's you look at profits if you have some booked and look at the float in relation to closed profit if it's like maybe $400 up over float and looks like it's not increasing over a period of time just take the profit, get out for the balance of the week and restart the EA the first of the following week. I believe timing this EA for the week is critical for a sucessful week

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I think that's a worthy suggestion.  I had a week full of winners only to get several open trades stopped on the report.  At one point yesterday my float was very low and in hindsight should have closed open trades for the remainder of the week.  But I was trading a new variation with different tp and sl for each currency pair and wanted to just let it run.  It was on a nice win streak, but I might have just forced a few losses if it was live.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
I am running Firebird G like you are with the Timeframe 30 and on a 30 minute chart.  This trades much more carefully I think.

Also I'm trading Firebird H with the 30/300 settings and no divergence on 30 minute charts.  It weathered the NFP storm pretty well.

Why couldn't we all just close our open GBPUSD trades before the NFP?  MIght seem rash but I don't think so really.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Yeah I got killed today as well. I think leaving it to run with the 30-300 settings isn't a good idea during NFP. You could get lucky once and while but I don't think it's worth the risk.

After today's events I think we should come up with a method to deal with big news events. (like just closing everything down that's floating and disabling the EA, or stop trading a couple of days before...)

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hi Yardie,

I know what you mean..  BOE rate decision yesterday, NFP today.  I am seriously thinking more and more of pulling Firebird before any events such as NFP, rate decisions, etc.  Firebird was doing great as of Wednesday, but got killed yesterday and today.  Demo accounts fortunately, but if this was live, I'd have not let it run the past two days.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I think we are being too quick to tamper with the EA. MOno has been using the EA for 7 weeks now 24/5 and he is 277-2 or somewhere around there. Because the EA has a negative net week doesnt mean thats its no good. I bet overall (example at the end of the month) it will be very profitable. I have decided to leave everything as is until the end of August and analyze things then.

I have been testing various flavours of Firebird and Phoenix for well over a month now and feel that I am accomplishing nothing. Why? Because I keep changing and tweaking and testing everytime the EA doesnt behave the way I expect it to. I am not giving the EA time to work and show what it is capable of.

IN terms of the NFP -- how often do you see prices move hundreds of pips in a few days? Once in a while. If it was a regular occurence then I would be worried...but its not.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
I agree with you Yardie

Only weakness i think about Firebird is stop loss set to 300 is too large. If I will go live with real account using this EA for sure never use such a kind of s/l.

Should be usefull to test firebird with lower and more reasonable s/l (like 100 or better 50).

--- 帖子 #696 ---
I dont mind the high stop loss provided that the wins far outweigh the losses. For me its the pips that count at the end of the day. Smaller stop loss could mean more losses and your account level drop much faster. Keep in mind that we have been testing Firebird with smaller stop losses before.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
BTW: Just eyeballing Mono's statement,  would it be an advantage not to trade Cable at all? I think his two losses were in Cable and it seems 35% of the Float are Cable as well. With out Cable he would have been about $900 better off, even allowing for the winning profit the other Cable trades would have made.

Just a thought...

OBSERVATIONS___

GBPUSD not suited for this system due to not reversing exhaustions

read it is in 63G

--- 帖子 #699 ---
that's interesting, hadn't seen that before. We must also remember that on thursday the BOE UNEXPECTEDLY RAISED RATES. Looking at my trades most of th losses would not have occured from the NFP alone. In short, this was an atypical couple of days for cable.

I can see firebird clawing back the profits over the next couple of weeks.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
I agree Yardie,

I have had 63G running since 31/7, was up about 6% net, until it got killed by the cable, now im net down -1%, which will fast recover.

Still im very impressed, it made consistanly over 1% a day in booked pips since start.

If I was to trade this EA live, and I am probably going to, I will watch it like a hawk, and close all trades/being on the sideline for big news days e.t.c. I am sure, that this EA will over the long run, say 1 year, produce very good results, especially with a bit babysitting on the side

... Anyway lets go ahead and test more, a few bad days is nothing who scares me away, no pain, no gain....

FT

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Could someone please direct me where to go so I can read exactly how this works?  I do not want to trade with an EA but I would be interested in seeing how the system works.    Thank you guys.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Interesting. I didnt know that. I will be cutting GBPUSD as of next week then. Results should be much better I am sure....

--- 帖子 #703 ---
very interesting, but many trades  was with GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #704 ---
mono, can you actualize the statement?

what leverage  are you using?

thanks

--- 帖子 #705 ---
You can read all about it in this document.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
All of my losses that came last Friday were on the GBPUSD (as well as the biggest negative floaters). Obviously a lot of my winners were on the GBPUSD. But what I'm going to look at my results if I was to remove the GBPUSD from the pairs I trade. I would have less winning trades, but I would have a decent profit instead of an overall loss due to all those losing trades it produced. Might as well reduce the risk factor this pair adds. (even if it means reducing the reward potential)

--- 帖子 #707 ---
I have decided to keep the GBPUSD for now since I am still testing. When my test period is over then I can analyze further and maybe drop the gbpusd once i start to trade live.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
I wonder if anybody has really analyzed how much of the stop loss is usually used even for a winning trade.  It could be that we could use a smaller SL on certain pairs, or for instance, once past 220 (just an example  number) we can give up and cut our losses.

Think I will spend some time analyzing this.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Or, something else to consider..  Is there a correlation between the gbp/usd losers and the news events that made it spike?  Last week we had BOE rate decision and NFP on Thursday and Friday.  If the gbp/usd tends to go haywire at these times, it may be an idea to shut off the gbp/usd during these periods of time.  There have been quite a few winners on the pound during less volatile periods.  I'd hate to throw those out.    Just an idea..

--- 帖子 #710 ---
HI Guys

End of week 7 and I record 8 losses (all gbpusd).

Generally this EA works really well, but at some point in time, it requires to be reset. By this I mean close all trades and start again. More analysis needed there.

The other thing that I'll will show, is how I configure each pair.

What I've done is, I've taken the average daily range for the last 2 years. For the gbpusd its about 150.

So my SL is 150 * 2 = 300, TP and pipstep is 10% of 300 which is 30.

I have been testing this over the past few week on ten pairs, and the results are very good.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
For less volatile pairs are you planning to adjust your position sizing as your S/L's are now less?

--- 帖子 #712 ---
For this test everything stay as is, I've got another test running, with the modified settings.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
I've been testing firebird for a few weeks at almost the same settings Mono specifies. Like anyone else who has been testing through this "volatile" time for the GBP/USD, I have several short trades floating at a substantial loss right now (around -200 pips).

This morning, Firebird successfully executed a *long* trade on the GBP/USD. Is the feed from Strategybuilderfx designed to allow hedging on the same pair, or is this some sort of anomaly? Also, if my platform does not allow hedging on the same pair, but firebird attempts to do so anyway, won't that "kill" my open trade? Is there a setting in firebird to prevent this sort of thing? Thanks!!!

--- 帖子 #714 ---
The two metatrader brokers I use both allow hedging, so I imagine that SBFX does too.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Firebird has become very USD-long and like it or not the FOMC today could make or break recent performance. An ideal tactic in retrospect would have been to close all positions last tuesday and wait until tomorrow to re-start. In effect, running firebird for the last 3 weeks in every month may be worthwhile.

Mono - any chance you could post your optimised settings you're trialling for each pair?

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Yes they are winners. But the losers are cancelling out the winners (or almost).

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Hi MONO!!! Try these setings

--- 帖子 #718 ---
These are my stats for the first week of testing.

Total Wins: 56

Total Losses: 2 (both GBPUSD)

Net Booked PIPS: 1080

Individual Pair Performance (Booked PIPS)

USDCAD - 300 pips

EURUSD - 240 pips

USDCHF - 240 pips

AUDUSD - 150 pips

USDJPY - 120 pips

CADJPY - 120 pips

NZDUSD - 90 pips

EURJPY - 90 pips

CHFJPY - 60 pips

GBPUSD - (-390) pips

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Right Yardie.. But shutting it down before news items which tend to cause losers is what I'm referring to.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Which version of Firebird are you using? I dont recall ever seeing a hedge position opened.

Mono how are your Phoenix tests coming along?

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Attached are Firebird v63g results and set file from Aug 1.

37 wins and 1 loss on gbp/usd.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Me neither.  That's why I thought it was so strange.  I'm using version 63G.  Currently I have the exact same install and settings on 2 PC's.  One I've been testing on sporadically for about 6 weeks, the other just a few days.  On the machine with the longer test, I've never seen a hedge, ever.

The 2 tests I'm running use identical settings and pairs.  The only difference being when Firebird is "enabled". (which I believe are identical to Mono's)

If this manner of hedging is allowed through the SBFX feed and most Metatrader brokers allow this then I guess it's not a big deal, but I find it fairly disturbing...

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Here is my plan for the "manipulated" test I'm running (where I start/stop firebird, and close trades at my discretion):  Obviously, there are several dollar-long positions open right now, but the FOMC decision isn't guaranteed either way.  If they announce a pause, then I will stop the program and immediately close as many of the dollar-long positions as possible.  Obviously, this will incur a loss relative to closing the positions prior to the announcement, but IMO it's worth the risk becuase the FOMC just might raise rates...

--- 帖子 #724 ---
I have a "hedge" position open on cable also.  Its a long opened Monday.  Still have 4 shorts open from last week.

With the large s/l, wouldn't this need to happen some? With the short timeframes Mono's setting use, the trend could easily change and still not have reached the s/l of previous orders.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Wackena,

Thanks for sharing. It seems my win / loss ratio using Mono's original setting is slightly higher than yours. The only difference I see with your setting is the 15 minute time frame. I also assume you are using it on a 15 minutes chart as well.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Actually I am a big fan of hedging as one can make money in both directions. But I havent seen any hedge positions open on my test account.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Wow, firebird ate FOMC for breakfast (or late supper here in the UK)!

--- 帖子 #728 ---
firebird not taking any trades. is that happening to many ??????

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Yes the TF=15, but the Chart is M1.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Yep it made some nice pips. I will let it roll and do what its suppose to do. Too many tweaking over the past few weeks.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Same here.  Just haven't had experience with a broker that allows it yet.  My main concern is attempting to use firebird with a broker who does not allow hedging on the same pair.  In that case it seems the system would start closing positions on itself.  But the primary reason this concerns me is that it seems like it ought to happen more often given the way the system works.

BTW, the FOMC didn't hurt much... I ended up closing 2 negative GBP/USD positions for a net loss of $370.00.  But that was mostly off-set by the $270-ish profit in closed trades from today alone.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
hELLO,

Since I ve open the acc, everytime I get in the trade and it right away go against me to end up with the average loss of 40 pips. I hate this loss.

May anyone please show me how to set up the Firebird?

What software program it s comparible with? What platform it is used for and how to get the platform?

I would much appreciate it!

Wish you have great pips

Nguyen

--- 帖子 #733 ---
My result are still impressive until today

EA Firebird V63G started on 1 Aug :

Trades win : 14

Trades loss : 0

Total Pips : +406 pips

Average Pips per day : 67.6

Chart TimeFrame : 30Min

EA TimeFrame : 30Min

Default setting used.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
What TP, SL, and StepPip values are you using? And which pairs are you trading?

Thanks

It might a good idea to switch to 30min instead of 1min TF (or 15min like Wackena). Especially if Skyline had no losses during last week (in which I think everyone had at least 1 loser)

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Here's setting :

TP = 30

SL = 300

StepPip = 30

Yes I agree Moneybags, a lot of users had big losses past week with TF1min , while on 30M seems to be less sensible to strong trend , I guess it depends on divergence. Infact no trade was opened on gbpusd , thus i didn't suffer any loss

--- 帖子 #736 ---
I agree. It's definitely more reliable I guess. Wackena had good results on the 15min TF with only 1 loss on the GBPUSD and you had no losses using 30min. (I had 3 losses on the GBPUSD using 1m)

There are probably less trades opened on the larger timeframes, but many losses will be avoided. I will be looking into testing larger timeframes.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
What about using an M5 or an M15 chart?  Would that find more of a happy medium between the M1 and the M30?  The M1 does have the potential to get killed on the gbp/usd,  but there have been quite a few winners when it was "behaving itself."

--- 帖子 #738 ---
I'd like to try how much could be strong enough Firebird on 30Min timeframe, when first loss will be hit then i will switch to another timeframe

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Can someone POST the Latest EA attachment file ... so I can paper trade it ... and see how it works for me? I am new at Forex and did not want to use a bad file ... so forgive me for asking. Really nice thread here! Thanks all!!!

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Here's latest EA

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I think I may have identified a problem with the above strategy.

Basically, by manually closing a trade I may impair firebirds ability to automatically protect against a strongly trending market.  As I understand the code, when a position stops out, firebird won't open another position on that pair until it gets a signal in the opposite direction.  So, if I manually close a losing trade....

Am I understanding correctly?

--- 帖子 #742 ---
skyline thanks!!! I did'nt realize it was a zipped file at first.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
The M1 chart brings a lot fo wins for sure -- 56 for me last week (vs 37 for Wackena). But I had 2 losses to Wackena's 1...but so far all the losses recorded are on the GBPUSD.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
But with inly 14 wins...1 loss will really hurt ya. Compare that with 56 wins and 2 losses. Remember 10 wins basically pays for 1 loss.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Has anyone here tried testing Firebird with a higher TP? just slightly.

I did some testing of my own on the EURUSD only so far, using a TP of 35 and it got the exact same number of wins as with the 30pip TP. Those additional 5 pips worked out to over $2,000 of extra profit in 3 months of testing.

You could always go back and see your winning trades and see if an extra 5 pips of profit was possible.

Just a thought.

PS: In addition, I also tested using a 250 pip Stop loss and it added 2 losing trades as opposed to 0 losers when using 300 pips.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
I don't understand the Firebird...Its been dollar bullish since the annoncement, but the firebird keeps going counter trend most of the day...Is it not suppose to go with the treand/?????????????????????

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Its taken 5 trades and everrone is -20 to -60 pips...U would think it would read the trend and go with it

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Firebird doesnt factor in the trend. It just does trades based on divergence. I finally see some hedged positions opened the past few hours. BUt my float has been cut in half and it keep rolling in the pips about 180 pips the past 2.5 hours or so alone.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Hey Yardie, while hedging u gain a pip and lose a pip. So u end up even?????

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Interesting findings moneybags. I think we can get away with a higher TP for pairs that move a lot each day (like GBPUSD). But it would be harder on slower moving pairs such as the USDCAD and AUDUSD.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
It will be perfect a modified version with 2 TP.

For example TP1 is 50 pips TP2 is 30 pips. If the trade doesnt reach 50 pips, it will secure the profit for 30 pips

--- 帖子 #752 ---
I guess i have only 14 wins (actually rised to 17) because i started to test EA later than you or other here.

Focus point here is that during past days EA with tf30 didn't suffer any loss, so it seems more reliable than tf1 or tf15 and this is direction when i'll continue to test it until some loss will occurs

--- 帖子 #753 ---
This os a good idea. This way if it goes above 30 pips but dont hit 30 pips then it will close out if an attempt is made to go below 30 pips again. I am not sure if this can be programmed into the EA though.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
pretty sure it can. yardie, with a breakeven function. I've seen it in other EAs. I'm not a programmer though. isn't it part of phoenix?

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Phoenix has a close order feature, but it is based on moving average calculations. Trailing stop has the ability to to lock in profits. For the example from kihl, if tp=50 and sl=30 would lock in 30 pips minimum when ask/bid is over 30 pips from entry price.

I would think a Trailing Stop feature could be added to Firebird v63g.

Wackena.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
I think Phoenix only has a trailing stop feature (which Firebird has as well). but its not the same thing.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Wackena I have used the trailing stop feature before...and it doesnt seem to work as advertised. For example it would close out with 10 pips profit instead of 30 pip profit etc. Am I missing something or this is the way it is suppose to work?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Skyline, I notice in your statement there are no open trades.  That's pretty unusual for firebird.  Did you close them manually?  Can you post a .set file?  I understand you're on 30 min TF and EA TF is also 30.  And you're running the 30-300-30 configuration, is that all correct?  Which pairs?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
I think Skyline mentioned earlier that he has been manually closing some trades.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Thx, Yardie, I didn't see that.  If that's true, that puts a whole new spin on his results then; i.e they're not reliable -- they're not the EA's true results.

Skyline, can you confirm whether you're closing manually?

--- 帖子 #761 ---
The other thing I noticed in Skyline's statement is that there's only one trade in the GBPUSD (in over a week of trading). That's really unusual as well for that pair.

Going back to the trailing stop idea, I was going to bring up that point. I think this could be a feature that would really increase profits. Because most winning trades have a bigger potential profit of 30 pips. So like mentioned before if a maximum SL of 45 pips for example was implemented and a trailing stop of 30 then many trades would give us that extra 15 pips. Again, you can only do this with certain pairs that move more than others.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Yes I think trailing stop would be a nice addition. It would also stop winning trades from turning to losing trades if the profit target is not hit.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Yardie,

Your correct as to how the Trailing Stop (t/s) as used in Phoenix and most othe EAs work. Firebird v63g does not have a t/s routine. The t/s code in Phoenix can be copied and pasted into Firebird. And to make it work as needed, the Modify Order line needs to be changed as follows.

OP_BUY code

Inserted Code OrderModify(OrderTicket(),OrderOpenPrice(),Bid-(Point*[color=red]TrailingStop[/color]),OrderTakeProfit(),0,GreenYellow);

change to:

Inserted Code OrderModify(OrderTicket(),OrderOpenPrice(),Bid-(Point*[color=red]5[/color]),OrderTakeProfit(),0,GreenYellow);

OP_SELL code

Inserted Code OrderModify(OrderTicket(),OrderOpenPrice(),Ask+(Point*[color=red]TrailingStop[/color]),OrderTakeProfit(),0,Red);

Change to:

Inserted Code  OrderModify(OrderTicket(),OrderOpenPrice(),Ask+(Point*[color=red]5[/color]),OrderTakeProfit(),0,Red);

With these changes, if t/p=50 and t/s=30, then t/s modified orders will close with at least 25 to 30 pips profit. If you want at least 30 pips on t/s modified orders, use t/s=35.

No no i never close manually trades and never i stated this in this forum , so my test is reliable

Speaking about no opened trades, just few minutes before i printed that statment , one trade was closed so at that time EA had no trade opened, actually i have 3 trades opened (2 sell on EUR/USD , 1 buy USD/CHF).

I'm testing with all standard settings 30-300 , with following 6 pairs : EURUSD, GPBUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF.

So far seems best pairs are : USDCHF (8 wins) , USDCAD (6 wins)

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Skyline, I think that your secret to low number of HIGH QUALITY trades is the fact you use the M30 chart instead of the M1.

I am going to run a test of those two accounts.  Same pairs, M30 versus M1 charts.  I know the M1 will trade more but will it at the end of the month show more pips?

I think you may enjoy adding the AUDUSD into your pairs traded.

Don

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Thank you for clearing that up, Skyline.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I think so, let's see in next weeks how it will perfom.

However i don't think that any loss will occur never, otherwise this is really holy grail

--- 帖子 #768 ---
You know Skyline, I'm kinda thinking that Firebird on the M30 charts, four pair (AUDUSD, EURUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF), low number of trades but high probability, looks more and more like the grail to me .... even with a loss here and there.  Once the confidence is built, then more substantial lots may be used.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Skyline, can you please post your set file?  I'd like to see your percent setting, divergence, etc.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
It's the same posted by Momo some posts ago with no changes, anyway i will  attach again here

--- 帖子 #771 ---
okay, thanks.  Looks like exactly the same, only difference is it's on a 30 min chart.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
things would have been al lot better if BOE hadn't surprised us last week.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Wackena would you please do us the honor of adding the trailing stop to FirebirdG and attach here as a MQ4 file? I am not a coder and dont want to muck anything up. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
I am intrigued as well... I may just jump on the bandwagon. I like quality over quantity. And there seems to be less floating losses with the 30 minute chart.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Hey Skyline did you make the EA run 24-7 or did you close it down on important news days?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
24-7 on my workoffice pc

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I am wonder if the middle ground is the following setting:

TP: 300

SL: 30

Percent: 0.05 (as opposed to .10 in Mono's setting)

30 minute chart

0.05 percent is the default for Firebird. Anyone trying this setting? Maybe I should be the guinea pig for this one...Actually I will.... Will let you guys know.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
I tried to study EA code , just to understand what's divergence and how affect EA performance.

Well it seems divergence to be defined and calculated as difference between SMA(23) and SMA(84) calculated both on open price on previous bar, so when we see EA that say for example 'Current Divergence = 0.0032' it means that difference between SMA's for previous bar was 32 pips.

So it's quite clear now that different timeframe will affect number of trades because SMA's difference will change accordingly.

I also wrote a simple indicator called 'Divergence' that shows very well this.

Remember to put a level 0.0002 (divergencelimit) so you will be able to see on chart when EA could enter a trade.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Yardie,

Attached is Firebird v63g-TS. TS stands for Trailing stop. If Trailing stop = 0, then no trailing stop is used.

Also added Money Management routine.

UseMM - This is a Money Management feature that calculates lot size based on percentage of AccountEquity. The percentage is set by the Risk input (percent number, no decimals; ie, 2 = 2%).

Lots input is used if UseMM = false

Hi guys,

It took me some time to read this thread, finished at last. :

Right now I am very curious how Mono is doing.

I began testing with his settings 2 days ago after FOMC and sofar 16 wins/ 0 loss, but floating loss is huge.

I am also testing phoenix v2, but things look very bad.

Few of you use this EA live. How are things going?

I am looking forward to see the results.

Keep up the good work everybody!

btw. Wackena, is your latest statement from a live account?

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Cool thanks Wackena!

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I closed out all my positions from the 1 minute chart and now using the 30 minute chart with 0.05 percent. I have 2 orders open one on SELL Cable another on BUY USDCHF. As if this moment both are in profit.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Thanks Wackena - I'm going to test with M15 your firebirdTS on USDCHF, AUDUSD, EURUSD and USDCAD.

why did you change MA to 15?

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Looking more deeply into code i found a bug in how divergence is calculated.

Infact divergence is ok when pairs are with 4 decimal digits (like EURUSD, USDCHF, GBPUSD and so on..) , but it's wrong for pairs with only 2 decimal digits like EURJPY , USDJPY,.... As you can see divergence value will be for ever more high than limit 0.002 so any trade will be opened for this pairs.

Other strange thing that I found in EA is that default settings are override for EURUSD,GBPUSD and EURCHF used in TF30 in following way :

Inserted Code void SetupGlobalVariables()

OK as of last night my time I am using the following settings:

TP-60

SL-300

TS-35

30 Miinute Chart

Percent: 0.05

So far I have one win (GBPUSD) for 60 pips. I currently have 5 positions open with a positive float of about 25 pips.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
We need find best setins for GBPUSD. Who that thinks?

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I think the 30 minute chart is the best one to use with GBPUSD.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Brave new test there Yardie.

ALL of my FXDD demo accounts are down this morning, showing no connection.  Anybody else with that problem?  Makes it a little hard to test.

Meanwhile all my IBFX demos are working fine.  Hope this doesn't continue.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Yardie, what pipstep are you going to use?

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Hey Skyline,

I'm not that familiar with MT4 code, so are you saying that the code is overriding the setting so that these currency pairs are always traded on the 30min TF? Or are you saying that if you set them to the 30M then the other settings are being overriden?

Sorry, I dunno if that makes sense....

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Is the Firebird v63G-TS.mq4 from Post #780 the best version to use now? ..... or with maybe a few minor changes?

QUESTION:

Can I just change ..... extern int MA_timeframe = 15; to extern int MA_timeframe = 30; to use it with 30 minute charts then? ............. and do I need to have 30min. charts on PC to make it work with the 30min in the EA?

QUESTION:

I have a paper trading MT4 acct., but only have around 4,500.00 at this time .... but if I change this part of the EA ..... extern double Lots = 0.01; ..... to say .... extern double Lots = 1.0; would this give me a full lot?

Right now I have 3 orders in the red ..... ofcourse I am still using the earlier version (Firebird_v0.63G) I plan on switching when my orders are closed.
I am new to forex and EA's ...but am trying to learn to where I can also make money with both .... Thanks for anyone that can answer these questions! Appreciated!!!

--- 帖子 #797 ---
timber on cable. shot in the arm for firebird. it'll probably open loads of USD shorts now!

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Something I've been thinking about with regards to switching from M1 to M30...

I know back testing is primarily good for spotting general trends and behaviors. Beyond that, it's not so reliable. So, in looking for general behaviors among trading pairs, I noticed that the EUR/USD did not post a single loss from 5/15 - 7/31 using the M1 chart (100+ trades during this period). The actual date range is not significant, but I think the length of time is. Several of us have had great success running this EA for 4 or even 6 weeks straight. However, I think my back testing indicates that a much longer time frame is needed in order to get accurate results from forward testing, even on the 1 minute charts.

So, for testing the M30 charts, I'm guessing the required testing period might be a good bit longer in order to get accurate results.

Within the next few weeks, I plan to set up a live account and begin trading micro lots with this EA. Primarily because I don't have the patience to forward test this thing on a demo account for the next 8 months!

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Yeah, I agree.

I'm also going to be starting with micro lots. I'm willing to lose a few hundred bucks (lets hope not) in the name of forward testing. And if all the other testing until now is any indication we should end up on the winning side anyway. My plan is 1 live micro acct and 2 live demo accounts for different settings tests.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
I'll do the same when I get some cash. Will stick with TF M1 and 63G. haven't decided on cable yet though. All losses eradicated today.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
I have pipstep 30 but the pipstep doesnt appear to be working. New orders are not being opened.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
At this point I'm not entertaining the idea of running this EA on a live account without  manual intervention occasionally.  With that in mind, cable would be awfully profitable if we could determine when to turn it on and off...  Of course, that really is the "holy grail" I guess. ;-)

--- 帖子 #803 ---
I think Mono's earlier suggestion of closing all trades at the end of the month and then starting again after the first week may be a good option.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
TS Version .... Mine is not working either.

Mine just has .... double CurrentPipStep; is that wrong?

Should it be .....double CurrentPipStep= 30; ??? When you have a version that actually works ... please post it. My origional one did work, but not the Firebird v0.63G-TS

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Hi there guys

I have tested Firebird since July and finetune it for August for GBP USD only...i think wackena and mono settings is great! Great work Trader Seven & Hendrik!!

Rite now i am only testing on GBP USD pair.

1 minute chart

TP 10 pips

Lot size 0.2

Account Value 1000USD 1:100 Leverage

Use Divergence is False

Percentage set to 0.05

The rest i would say i follow mono settings.

Time setting i havent adjusted on the system yet..but best time to open trade is 1100EST - 0200 EST which i do it manually and close all positions before 0430 EST or London Open 0300 EST.

My strategy is small pips size but big lot size and i select GBP USD because they hit my pip size fast. I hope you guys can try on the other currency and give some feedback.

I do not open my trades 24 hours because of the whipping by news announcement mainly 430 EST to 1000 EST. NO Trades during these hours.

I will also not open any trades if i know there special announcement like the interest rate announcement by FOMC at 1400 EST few days back and also if Mr Bernanke Speaks..Hehe..i only open my trades 30 minutes to 1 hour after the last major news in USA for the day..

What i will do is I will open my trades after 1030 EST (after the usual USA news announcement at 1000 EST) and close my positions before any news announcements in UK at 430EST or earlier at 0300 EST.

If u look at my results, i got whipped today by the trade deficit news which was announce 830 EST. I went in at 930 EST and got whipped really hard...Did the data came out late at 930 EST????

I did observe the whipping and if i were on a live account, then i would have hit margin call....

So after today's whipping, I will now onli open my firebird after 1100 EST.

So far on average, 4-8 trades closed per day (40-80 pips) a day.

Is there anyway to restrict opening order to only 1 position?

What i observe lately is when my account balance is getting larger..it will open 2 or extra positions..isit something to do with my percentage?

--- 帖子 #806 ---
The CurrentPipStep is not an input variable and is only used in PiPStep calculations if "IncreasementType" is greater than 0.

The PipStep is set via the EA chart properties or in the code at the line  "extern double  PipStep = 30;". I'm running TS version on 2 demos and 1 Live accounts and all are working OK. It places PipStep orders and the Trailing Stop has closed orders with profit. I don't know why your EA is not working.

I do see Firebird original and TS placing Hedge type orders. So far, no problem. But, I've been testing Firebird for 3 months and never had this happen. Why now. It's a mystery to me.

Automan,

I believe that Skyline discovered an important detail for the rest of us.  The actual settings for EURUSD and GBPUSD are found later in the script in a special section and are nothing like what you think you are using.  I believe the percent setting is 0.25 and the Pipstep is only5.  Refer back to Skyline's last post where he details this discovery. You can edit it in the script if you wish down to 0.05 or .1 like most of us use.

I like what you are doing here.  A good combination of manual and automatic trading.  Just about Grail time I would say ;-)

--- 帖子 #808 ---
does the code tailored to individual pairs override my inputs on the trading platform?

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Yes cgldsmth.  For the pairs that are not commented out.

The ones affected in my copy of Firebird v63G are the EURUSD, GBPUSD, and EURCHF.  Look for the lines that begin after "Void" in your metaeditor.

Lines beginning with // are "commented out" and not active.  But the percent and pipstep figures and being changed from the global settings.  I didn't find this section in my copy of Firebird_H.

Here is a clip from the section I'm talking about:

void SetupGlobalVariables()

{

switch(MagicNumber) {// included by Renato

case 26910: // EURUSD,M30 // optmized 06/03/20

//     MA_length=18; // George's setting

//    MA_timeframe=30;

//     MAtype=0;

Percent=0.15; // George's setting

TradeOnFriday=1;

slip=100;

//     Lots=0.05;

//     TakeProfit=30; // George's setting

//     Stoploss=300;

PipStep=5;

IncreasementType=0.0;

DVLimit = 8; // included by Renato

OpeningHour = 6; // included by Renato

ClosingHour = 14; // included by Renato

break;

case 25803: // GBPUSD,M30

//     MA_length=18;

//     MA_timeframe=30;

//     MAtype=0;

Percent=0.25;

TradeOnFriday=1;

slip=100;

//     Lots=0.05;

//     TakeProfit=30;

//     Stoploss=100;

PipStep=5;

IncreasementType=0.0;

DVLimit = 8; // included by Renato

OpeningHour = 7; // included by Renato

ClosingHour = 15; // included by Renato

Wackena I dont think the Trailing Stop Feature is working in your updated EA. I had a USDJPY position which was within 10 pips of its 60 pip TP. Now its only 12 pip and the TS didnt kick in to lock in the pips. I have the TS at 35. Am I doing something wrong?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Yardie,

Do a backtest and then check the Results tab and see if some orders are being modified. If TS is working, you will see modified orders.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #812 ---
I think that if you use TF30 then default settings is override only for that pairs written in EA code.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
I think the next step in the development of this EA will be to set individual settings for each pair, along with TFs and hours traded. I await to hear about Mono's settings trial.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Thanks traderone for your feedback.

I tested with another account yesterday for cable [1100 EST - 0300 EST]

7 positions open and closed.

70 pips. 0.2 lots. Profit $140.

My weekly target is only 200 pips.

by the ways, whats the difference if u set percent setting from 0.05 to 0.25?

what happens if we reduce pip size from 30 to 5?

is there anyway i can edit firebird so that it can open only 2 trades the most at one time? this is to avoid margin call.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
+586 pips starting 1 Aug 2006

20 wins - 0 loss

...and a lot of trades wasn't opened due to bug on divergence calculation on EURJPY,USDJPY,... (pairs with 2 decimal digits), i will try to fix it

Testing with default settings 30-300, TF30

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Great but your floating loss is about 1/3rd of your book pips at the moment.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Yes this is first time since i started to test EA that i have so high floating loss , well let's see if they will turn into wins trade

I fixed EA divergence issue for following pairs :

USDJPY

EURJPY

CHFJPY

AUDJPY

CADJPY

NZDJPY

GBPJPY

so now it should enter trades for this pairs more frequently.

I also fixed my divergence indicator.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Hi Guys

Well i'm back, lots of catching up to do. Anyway lets get stuck into in.

First of all, my individual settings are -

EUR/USD TP=22 SL=220 PIPSTEP=22 Daily Avg Range = 110

GBP/USD TP=30 SL=300 PIPSTEP=30 Daily Avg Range = 150

USD/CHF TP=25 SL=250 PIPSTEP=25 Daily Avg Range = 125

EUR/JPY TP=21 SL=210 PIPSTEP=21 Daily Avg Range = 105

USD/JPY TP=20 SL=200 PIPSTEP=20 Daily Avg Range = 100

USD/CAD TP=21 SL=210 PIPSTEP=21 Daily Avg Range = 105

AUD/USD TP=16 SL=160 PIPSTEP=16 Daily Avg Range = 80

EUR/CHF TP=10 SL=100 PIPSTEP=10 Daily Avg Range = 50

EUR/GBP TP=9  SL=90  PIPSTEP=9  Daily Avg Range = 45

AUD/JPY TP=15 SL=150 PIPSTEP=15 Daily Avg Range = 75

Also trialling a modified firebird which, switches from standand mode to a trend mode, trend mode also closes trades that are going against the trend, other features included are trades expire after 7 days, closing all trades before upcoming news events, and trading pair limit setting. Hopefully floats will be under a bit more control.

Will also (when time permits) code a news event handler, which will place hedge trades 1 or 2 min before a event, that should be fun.

I noticed that the markets being up and down like a yoyo, while Ive been away. My floats are way down to -1200 and profits up. After a crappy week last week, we are at 348-10 as of now, 9 are GBPUSD, and 1 EURJPY which has been around for nearly 8 weeks ( costing me a fortune in swaps).

I figure the next 2-3 weeks to be very profitable, until end of month comes around.

Will post week 8 results after market closes.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Skyline,

Did the Divergence Issue affect all chart settings or just the 30 minute chart?

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Divergence bug only affects jpy pairs

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Mono - thanks for the settings and I'm very excited about your new EA trial.

this last few days has been excellent for firebird and I think I'll keep going with M1 10 pairs but shut it down at end of month.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
All timeframes.

Due to bug divergence fix, one eur/jpy order closed sucessfully with +30 pips

22-0

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Yes I have switched back to the 1 minute chart as well as I think it will be the most profitable in the long run -- and more trades are opened and closed there. I have made two modifications to Mono's setting though.

Percent changed to 0.15 from 0.10 and TF set to 15.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
If I were to shut it down, it would be close of market 25th and reopen again on the 6th or 13th a day after US interest rate statement.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
I'm not sure but I think the small pipstep setting would increase the number of trades whn the price moves against your position.

If you have trades open at closing time, what do you do?  I just closed minelast night (with losses).  Reopened this morning a few minutes ago.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
yardie, if you don't mind me asking, what is your reasoning behind these changes?

I think I'll trial a new demo next week closing all trades every day with MONO's settings for each pair.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
This is true if you place your EA on the 30min chart, the magicnumber is calculated on pair & chart, so if you trade on the 1m chart those settings are ignored.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Attached are results for FireBird v63g Aug 1-Aug 8 and FireBird v63g-TS from Aug 9-Aug 11.

Highest float range was negative 900-1000 pips.

12:00 EDT - 13 open orders on 9 pairs with negative ~405 pips.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Well the higher the percentage, the less trades are open. I am hoping that with this settings more quality trades will be opened. Also Firebird was really designed for the 15 minute time frame (not the 30 minute). Wackena is having less losses with the 15 minute time frame on the 1 minute chart than the 30 minute setting by Mono (strange but true).

Anyhow so far so good. Since I changed it a few hours ago I am up 3 wins with a small float of negative 30 pips.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
absolutely, however the losses were mostly incurred by the BOE and NFP days last week with the cable "surprise". My impression is that firebird carries a probability of profitable trades in excess of losing trades so that the more trades it carries out the better. Of course quantity and quality would be ideal. Will be very interesting to use the customised settings to see which performs best over the next month.

maybe we should be more organised about this and alot each other with specific settings to demo, much like occured on the vantagepoint thread earlier this year. Of course we'd need same time settings, demo size, server etc..

--- 帖子 #831 ---
In your test your position sizes vary from .1 to .4.  What method are you using to determine those sizes?  Not sure how it needs to be done, but I can't get off the money management side of this EA.  Would love to hear yours or others inputs the best approach to take.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
I'm varying the lot size manually depending on the float.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Mono,  what do you mean by a trading pair limit setting?

--- 帖子 #834 ---
traderone,

usually i will let my open position carry forward to the next day at 0500 EST.

i do not mind the swap interest.

all my positions if open i hope it will all close wit profits latest before london open at 0300 EST. So far 0300 EST has been kind to my open position and all closed wit profits.

I normally will disable my EA at 0200 EST to avoid opening new positions at this time.

If latest by 0400 EST i still have open position, what i will do is i will put a SL of max 15 - 20 pips and hope for the best.

today friday triggered 4 orders after 1100 est, 3 closed with profit and 1 more position is still floating.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
anyone trading firebird live have some results to post?

--- 帖子 #836 ---
I think Mono is trading LIVE and has been doing so for some week now.

Hi Guys

End of week 8 testing.

And after a terrible week 7, week 8 was awsome.

The test stands @ 350-10 with floats around -$1300.

It means setting a limit on how many open position you allow per pair.

At this stage my live test is a few bucks worst than break even. Was terrible 2 week ago with some losses, but made up ground last week.

Hopefully by end of the week I'll be in the black.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
MOno I guess you are in the red because of the time you started. I think the equity curve will go up from now on.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Mono

First of all - thanks for your effort and willingness to share your expertise with us all - I appreciate it very, very much!

I am trying to mimic your account from 1 August - using exactly the info you posted.  (Except only 0.10 lot and not increasing)  (I am in South Africa GMT +2)...

Example:  On 10 Aug your account showed 19 closed positions ($525 @ 0.10 lots)  My account shows 12 closed trades ($373)

On 11 Aug your account showed 11 closes @ $300 and my account showed 8 closes @ $220.  I tried to match individual trades but that seems an impossible task!

Do you have an opinion why this is so different?

--- 帖子 #841 ---
HI!

Went through all the thread and want to say thanks to all the people for the work and effort they put into testing Firebird. MONO :-) Your results are indeed great for 8 weeks of testing :-) Wanted to ask you with which pairs did you make this test and if you had your charts open in the 1 min or 30 min chart (Timeframe 30 , i know).  Also wanted to ask you how it is going with your test of the individul pair settings you posted recently.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Mr.Trader welcome to the forums. Are you sure you went through the thread?  Mono posted several times what settings and pairs he is using. Check the zip file that he has been attaching the past few weeks. Anyhow he is using 30 minute time frame for the Firebird EA but on the 1 minute chart. (Firebird default settings is for 15 minute time frame). I think Wackena his doing his test on the 15 minute chart using 15 minute settings and he is doign OK as well.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Could the broker that you are using have something to do with it? All brokers are not the same -- and the charts are slightly different with some of them. I knowof an another EA thats works great with one broker but has to be tweaked and tested to work with another.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hey Yardie!

Thanks for your answer, no indeed i read the whole thread i just wanted to have an additional confirmation about the pairs traded, wasnt really sure if it were only these ones in the zip file posted. Anyway thanks for your answer and welcoming me :-).

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Hi Guys

What's "Daily Avg Range" factor in mono's setting ? is it daily pips os is it another factor that we should set ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #846 ---
My understanding was that it was just a guide to show you where he derived those numbers.  I don't think it is a variable you can input.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Daily Average range is the amount of movement in a given pair on a daily basis (on average). It has nothing to do with Firebird per se... It us just general knowledge.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
I have the same problem here. It is impossible to produce the same results, even when you use the same broker and settings.

I have this EA running on 4 accounts and all are different. Some place a trade and other do not.

Compare them and it looks like a random chaos strategy.

As long as the EA can make profits, I don't really care.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Hello Humax and Benna,

As far as I understand from the code, the reasons why u will have different trades are:

1. Firebird doesn't do the trade on the close of the bar (that's the reason why backtesting is unreliable)

2. As soon as you get into the "first" trade of the pair, firebird is not going to catch the "spike" outside the envelop anymore.  Instead, it use the average down system (Pipstep).

I think that's the reason why u will get different trades if you start your firebird at different time.

I have tried to convert firebird into MT3 code but unsuccessful mainly due to the pipstep.  However I have done simple test about the envelop concept.  For Eur/USd, it should get around 92-93% accuracy with setting of TP20/SL200 or TP30/SL300 that means your "first" trade of the pair should hit the target most of the time - my conclusion is firebird should be safe for EUR/USD pair.  (Well, the other pairs are inconclusive esp. GBP/USD which seems to be just breakeven with most of settings I tried)

Hope that helps.

I like the table. Maybe we'll soon get an idea as to the best pairs for firebird. traderone gave up on firebird using TP20 SL50 saying EURJPY and USDJPY were the only profitable pairs. My firm belief is that firebird needs a bigger stop loss to breathe, but occasionally resetting, prob at end of month. Looks to me like JPY crosses may be dragging results down.

were your cable losers on BOE and NFP days?

--- 帖子 #852 ---
I agree. A SL50 is way too small for this system. A 300 pip SL might not be necessary for certain pairs that don't as much but at least 200 is needed I think. I had 3 cable losers and all were on BOE and NFP. Other than those losses I haven't had a single loss yet in over 2.5 weeks of trading. I have a pretty big negative float but an even bigger profit. Even if I closed all my floats on the spot I would have a pretty good profit. I want to start testing the 15min TF next. So far I've only tested the 1 min.

I will be posting my results at the end of this week.

I think we have a pretty good system on our hands here. No holy grail, but at least it wins more than it loses.....

Today was a stellar day with Firebird. And my float hasnt been more than 300 pips so far with my new settings (15 minute on 1 minute chart with TP 30 SL 300 and Percent 0.15). I started to use these settings last Friday and will be sticking with them until I go live.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
I just started a test on the 15 min. charts using the following settings - TP 30 and SL 115 with everything else set at the default settings.  I will update at the end of the week on how it is doing.  So far it has closed three positive trades and seven are currently open with all positions either positive or floating near break even.

I think the more people testing various settings on different time frames the better.  Only time will tell which time frame and settings are the best and if this system can remain profitable during a strong trend.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
all fine'n'dandy.

now lets think worst case scenario. How would we deal with a heavily trending market that has no reversals to the vegas tunnel? this could wipe out a lot of equity. You could close all positions but this relies on being able to identify what is a "heavily trending market". Could lower lot sizes to very small to limit risk, since firebird will be opening a large number of trades against the trend depending on the pipstep level.

any thoughts?

I think it might work through Metatrader 3 or 4. I use One World at www.1wfx.com. They have MT3...

I think the market we experienced in April 2006 qualifies as a very strong trend.  Through back testing, I'm sure everyone has noticed there was some significant draw down during that time.  However, I still find the results encouraging because the vast majority of the time, the market is not trending like this.  While losses were significant, they were not always sufficient to wipe out total net profits.  And IMO a trend that strong isn't so hard to spot.  Case in point, many traders experienced record profits during it time.  Like most of us (hopefully), I won't be depending on firebird for all my pips.  I also have a trend-following system or two which will complement very nicely.

Also, I guess the very beginning of a strong trend is hard to catch, but catching it even a little late would result in much fewer losses.  The heavy losses in backtesting are a result of firebird going counter trend all the way along.

I agree, I use williams percentage on the 30min chart with setting of 89 to show me if a trend is in motion. Usually if its outside the -15  or -85 range and stays there, you know you are in trouble.

Hey Guys

Question, I know when u have open trades with firebird and close the platform it continues to trade those trades..But with firebird EA ingauged and u close the platform does firebird still open trades?????????????

What kind of losses did you see in the backtesting SM31?

--- 帖子 #861 ---
The trades are still going because they are on the server. Firebird cannot open trades if its not active (ie Metatrader is up and the EA is activated).

They were most significant on the GBP/USD and USD/CHF.  On those 2 pairs, that one trend was enough to wipe out any gains from 1/1/06 - present and then some.  Other than that few weeks though, they were very positive.

I was interested to see that the EUR/USD finished well into positive territory in spite of big draw down in April, and the USD/CAD rocked.  In all the firebird testing I've done, seems like the USD/CAD has consistently been the best pair.  However, I don't like to read into back test results that much.  For example, I think cable can be a real cash cow on this EA.  I'd hate to write it off because of a back test with one nasty trend.  Or maybe different settings would be appropriate.  I haven't gotten that far.

What I haven't figured out yet is whether good/bad results are due to "typical" behavior of a pair, or some unique set of market conditions that don't occur very often.  That's gonna be a tough one...

Yikes thats scary. BUt I think if the float gets too big then you know its time to wait out the trend and close all positions.

For those trading firebird LIVE:

what brokers are you using? Obviously hedging needs to be allowed.

Anyone had any broker problems with firebird?

--- 帖子 #866 ---
I've been lurking in the background for a few weeks, have read through the thread in its entirety a couple of times. I'm amazed at the work that everyone has done and am now doing my own forward testing which reinforces the results seen on others statements. I'm looking forward to going live sometime in the next week or two.

Another reason for this post is that I am interested in knowing if anybody has developed an indicator for the envelope based on the percentage setting of the envelope width. I just think it would be nice to actually have a visual of this envelope on the chart. I believe this visual would assist one in determining optimal percent settings. If you look at Trader Seven's original write-up of the Firebird system it shows his envelope on the charting examples. Not being a programmer, I don't know where to start. Is anyone out there game to put one together?

Firebird indicator.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Yes, not sure where but it has been posted a few times times in the thread.  It is handy.  If no one posts it I'll will -- but gotta run now.  Maybe do a search for it in the meantime.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
I'm just curious, which timeframe did you backtest this on? I'm sure there were significant losses regardless what timeframe was used, but I wonder if the losses would be much less if using 15min or 30 instead of the 1 min which is little more unstable especially in trends.

I think the 2 weaknesses of Firebird are big news and strong trending markets. If we can just establish a couple of ways to minimize our losses during those times then I think we'll be fine. Even if it means simply disabling the EA for a period of time. I like keeping it simple.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Firebird fascinates....

with 30-300 "crazy" settings, we have a 10:1 probablility of a winning trade. Now this is the case whether the market is trending or not. So in the last few weeks Firebird has racked up a lot of dollar-long trades, the trend, when it happens, has a 50:50 chance of going with or without those trades. Over the course of time, whether the market trends or is range-bound, this EA should win-out right? Mono is currently 350+ to 10, so the statistical significance of the EAs "intelligence" in swinging the odds above 90% are growing.

Thus I can only think that poor money management or a series of extremely unlucky fundamentals could destroy this EA.

That shouldn't stop us from looking to improve though, of which there are the following goals the good folk on this thread should tackle:

Which pairs (I'm thinking JPY crosses may be better dropped)

Which weeks, if not hours to activate the EA

When and if to close all open trades

TP/SL/PS settings customised for each pair (as per Mono's average daily range).

What time frame

What MA TF.

Best broker for this system - must permit hedging.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Leaning in the same direction about the JPY crosses, but I'm going to wait longer on it.

Not sure if anyone other than Mono has let a non-tinkered with test run long enough to begin to answer that (his is still pretty small sample IMO).

I've had two thoughts about the closing of trades. The first is creating some kind of sliding scale between total pip drawn and negative swaps. So as the negative swap increases, my S/L for that trade decreases. My latest test is only two weeks old, but my oldest 14 open trades are all swap negative. At some point it makes no sense to keep them open as there is no profit potential in them. I'm just not sure how that should be done.

Second, i've thought about treating each Firebird session as one large multi-entry trade. And so set an overal T/P for the whole series of trades. For example say 1000 pips. My latest test first reached a net 1000 pip gain on 8/10 (started 8/3). Strongly considered closing everything then, taking the gain, readjusting the position size and going again. My attraction to this kind of approach is it would appear to make MM a little more concrete. An overall S/L could also be put in place for each series and position sizing would be easier to set. That said, I still can't bring myself to do it. If Firebird is profitable long term, resetting of any kind would seem inefficient. This EA is very similar to a one-directional grid trade and killing the "Firebird grid" seems to me somewhat counter-productive.

Different t/p's and s/l's seems proper to me and Mono's approach may be the way to go. For the less voliate pairs (eur/gbp comes to mind) spreads may begin to play a much larger role, however.

As for the different time frames, I haven't begun to tinker with them.

just my thoughts,

Jonathan

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Johnothan interesting thoughts. I like the one about the pip target. I think it would be great on a live account. But for forward testing on a demo, its better to make things flow as it should.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
This was all done on the 1 Minute charts with data downloaded from Alpari.  I've done some quick tests with the 15 minute charts and achieved very similar results, but that was several weeks ago.  I think I'll go back and compare the results more closely.

Me too!  I think that some manual intervention is not only a simple solution, but a wise one as well for those who are "qualified" to employ this EA.  It's this part of the deal that should make new traders extra cautious.  I just hope there aren't newbs out there looking at this EA (or just about any automatic trader) to provide a short cut to Forex profitability.  IMO this is just another tool, and subject to the same basic rules that most other trading systems adhere to.  In the wrong hands it'll be a disaster.  I believe that when there is real money involved, the same discipline and market knowledge is required for long term profitability that I have to apply to my manual trading systems.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Amen!

--- 帖子 #875 ---
We have a fair number of people all playing around with the same basic concept.

My question is:  Has anyone broken it yet?

What I mean is has anyone started a test that used the core of Mono's settings (1:10 - tp/sl) and had it go under?

It might be the most helpful thing we could see a statement that was blown up by these settings.  I am sure it can be done, just haven't seen it yet.

Jonathan

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Well its hard to say about the blown up account since we didnt started testing before the strong trend in April. It hard to say how Firebird would ahve faired...and events like those dont come very often.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
After a week forward testing, I noticed that firebird can't hedge.

It just add positions while the market goes agains you.

The distance is set by pipstep.

Nothing more, nothing less.

And I have no clue why I don't have any trades added starting yesterday noon while my pipstep is 30.

edit: Does anybody know how to shut up the message "excessive loss!"?

I have disabled Events, but it just keeps on popping up!

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Hi cgldsmth

Good work! With all the hard work Mono and the other guys has put in, I sense that the table is set for Firebird to produce in real $ terms...

A few pages back (can't find it now) - someone mentioned that we should do concerted testing. I think that is a great idea. We need someone like you & Mono to work out a schedule for testing with different settings - from the "crazy" to the "scared". Won't you draw up a type of spreadsheet with different combinations and timeframes and post it. Each of us can then pick 2 or 3 and test it live over the next few weeks and post the results every weekend. We can then sort through everything and go live with the best.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Well I have seen a few hedge positions in the past. But not a lot. Now sure about your excessive loss message...Never seen it before.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Hello sm31 and everyone,

I have also backtested the USD/CAD after I saw your post. It reaches 95% possibility for the "first" trade win (setting of 30/300). It is indeed the good pair for firebird concept. (win:loss = 632:31 over 1 year period)

Bad months to start firebird are the big "holiday" Month - namely Christmas(December) and Easter(April) - Most of the losses were produced on that two months. (It is the same as EUR/USD and USD/CAD).

(By the way, for testing EUR/GBP for last 1 and half year with setting 30/300, you should get no loss at all because the pair is basically trading within 300-400PIPs range. However looking at longer timframe, you will find out that it wasn't that correlated previously - therefore I wouldn't put it in my list for firebird yet)

Hope that helps.

Added: To be honost, I like hedge more than pipstep.  If there is going to be code change, I would drop pipstep and let the pair hedge itself (since it has such high probablity of winning).  I simply don't like the average down system at all.  Happy trading everyone.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Hey Puppy thanks for your insights. What were the specifc numbers you got for EURUSD and EURGBP? You posted for USDCAD but not the others. I am curious.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Hello Yardie,

I forgot to put it up.  EUR/USD for 30/300 is 821:58.  EUR/GBP is 140:0 (but I won't add EUR/GBP as I said this pair trade only within that 300-400PIP range for last 1 and half year and I didn't take into account of SWAP which may eat all your profit).

Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Five carefully selected pairs since last Wednesday.  Not bad.  Actually on M1 charts with Mono settings.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Before I try to code this I wanted to hear thoughts on this Idea.  What if the instead of another order being placed after the 90th pip against the initial position we add a position in the oposite way for as long as we need to hedge the second loss. any thoughts hope that was clear.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
I think its a good idea. Code it and we can do some backtests to see how it would pan out. Maybe the EA can hedge with 3 times the lot to make up for the loss as well. The hedge would need to somehow stop new positions from opening at that point.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Traderone,

I have similar results on live and demo settings. It does very well until any important news happens. I had it producing about $5K [1 lot each] every two days on 10 pairs, but when the CPI news happened yesterday, they took a fall. Even without Cable, all the $ ones went into the Red.

So in future, I will take the money and bank it and switch off before the 'Red Ticket' News.

Hmmmm.  Don't blame you.  But I wonder why mine didn't tank during the CPI?  Difference in feeds maybe?

--- 帖子 #889 ---
My float increased to about -800 pips after the CPI. But thats about it. I am still reeling in the pips in between.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
I am using interbankfx.  No problems so far.

Wiz.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Great job guy´s !

I post my satements, plaese look at them, i use settings Firebird 30-300 form momo but my floating positions minus always break even with with my closed profits ... Is this normal for this EA ??

--- 帖子 #892 ---
What do you mean that your floating positions closed at break even? The should keep on floating until there is a loss or a win.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
I mean if the closed positions are may be 500$ also the floating positions are in this high...  look at my satements please, then you see. Is this a characteristic from this EA, more the profit more open positions ?

Thanks !

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Yardie, what were those settings you switched to?  I can't find the post.  You went back to 15 minute and changed the percent, didn't you?  Are you still running the 30-300-30 on which pairs?  Thx.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
In my forward testing, float varies significantly.  Occasionally it will build up to as many as 20 open trades (on 10 pairs), then a news event increases volatility and a lot of trades get "flushed" out... Hopefully for profit. ;-)

Citing CPI-day as an example.  Float on one test was approximately $1100 prior to the news announcement, and about $250 afterwards.  Meanwhile, equity increased.

I hope I understood your question correctly.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Yes I am using TP 30 SL 300 Percent .15 TF 15 programmed in EA. Using on 1 minute chart.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Yes sometimes its possible that the float might exceed the net profit gained if thats what you are asking. For example I have booked about 1200 pips since Friday. But the floating is about -850 pips now.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Thanks.  I thought you were on 15 minute chart for some reason.  I'm on 1 min chart, 15 TF, .1 percent with 30-300-30.  Your envelope is just a bit wider than mine.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Yardie... How many pairs are you trading now with your new settings? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
It is 50% wider .

Traderone I am trading 11 pairs.

GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDJPY, EURJPY, AUDJPY, CHFJPY, CADJPY

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Have you found that bit wider to have an effect on the float in terms of limiting the number of trades opened?  Does it seem like the quality of trades have improved?

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Seems that way..my float hasnt been more than -900  so far.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Thanks for your reply.  Is anybody using the Skyline version of Firebird G?  The one that fixes the divergence for the JPY pairs?

Wondering what your thoughts are on the JPY pairs Yardie.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
I am using the Skyline fix one and get quite a lot of JPY orders being opened and closed now. I will post my results once I compile them a bit later...started last Friday with the new settings etc.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Yardie - could you post the fixed skyline version please?

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Here's fixed version for you

Later I will add my result from forwarding test...

--- 帖子 #907 ---
My winning trades still continue..

Testing Firebird v0.63G (fixed JPY version)

Pairs tested : EURUSD , GBPUSD , EURJPY , USDJPY , USDCAD , USDCHF

Trades win : 36

Trades loss : 0

Total PIPS : +1066

Lot size : fixed 0.1

Best pairs (*) : USDCAD (14 winning trades) , USDCHF (11 winning trades)

TimeFrame : M30

EA usage : online 24/7

Max float drawdown : about 300$

Let's see if next NFP will kill Firebird on 30 minute

I'm thinking to add some kind of money managment routine taken from another well coded EA.

(*) Fixed version went online about on 11 Aug thus there is lot less trade opened on EURJPY, USDJPY

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hmmmm. Skyline.

Can you say "grail"?

--- 帖子 #909 ---
ehehe i don't know Traderone but i think we are quite close  Only thing that scared me is 300 pips stop loss  It's enough to get 3 losses that all gain will be gone

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Yes the number sounds good but as you said 3 losses and you are wiped out. Keep posting your results though. I am intrigued.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Hey skyline

What I have been doing is a combo of manual trading and letting firebird do its thing also. If I see a trade getting out of hand u have to close it out. If I see a counter trend develping againt me and am  -100 or so I close.  On the profit side sometimes I will close them if its only 10 or so pips in profit. In 3 different platforms since 8/4/06 I have racked up about $ 9 grand. Now some of the money did come from straddle's on a few annoncements. About $3000 were from annoncements. My point is the only way to make profit is to take it when u have it. It would foolish to let a trade go all the way to -300 pips. I know sometimes u cant always be watching, so I think just scalping when u can along with firebirds expertise its a winning system all the way around. ITS AWESOME.

Anyway your results are great. Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Alsup I think I will do some manual closing of losing positions (not winning ones) if I take Firebird live as wlel. Right now I am still testing though.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
If you do this, why not just set the stoploss to something other than 300?

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Skyline, you're in a 1 min chart with EA timeframe of 30?

--- 帖子 #915 ---
He is using 30 minute chart if I remember correctly.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Yeah, I should let my winning one's play out, but when I see a good profit I'm taking it. I have seen some 20 pip profits turn into loss's, so I take what is given to me. But I understand completely.....Since I have started combo trading with firebird, I have consistantly made money on a daily basis. That was never the case before. Like James16 says, if u can't do it a demo u can't do it live. Took me about -4 grand to get it into my head. But this system along with manual, I think is the ticket to financial freedom........

Simply incedible....

--- 帖子 #917 ---
I could do that, but my success seems to be doing the combo trading. Its working very well. I'm not about to change how i do things if its working this well. Besides it fun scalping as u get into profit. I let it run quite aften also, but if I see something going strongly aginst me, I get out.  Preservation is the name of the game to trade another day

--- 帖子 #918 ---
I see what you mean Alsup, but right now i'm in testing mode with demo account so i'm trying to stress this EA in all market condition to see how can be powerfull also in negative trend.

Let me do an example, some days ago i posted a statement where I had a float loss of about 300$ mostly on USDCHF ,  i did decide to let them run without stopping out manually, now those 3 trades on USDCHF are closed all in profit and one of this trade on USDCHF was opened for about a week , obviously if you don't have an high stop loss you cannot hold a position for so much long time.

However, besides how much money could make this EA , i think that Firebird could be a starting point for us to study it deeply to understand how it works  and to develop our trading strategy using it.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Yes i'm on a 30 minute chart for all pairs.

Please someone try to forward test Firebird with this timeframe (and different pairs if you want) so we can double check results

--- 帖子 #920 ---
absolutely. Firebird needs room to breath to give the inherent probability of the 10:1 success ratio a chance to manifest. I've also had quite a few trades that have closed with profit after a week.

we may have seen the start of a concerted uptrend in the dollar today so we'll get the chance to see how it does in a trending market. remember that less than 30% of the time is the market trending.

one approach would be to top-slice profits whenever the account is doubled.

note on my statement that the profit factor is increasing toward 3 now.

good work everyone.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hi,

Can you please post your setting and on what time frame are you using...according to your statement you are using MM=True...right ??

Thanks

Babar

--- 帖子 #922 ---
ur right. your results are pretty close to mine, and I have to work my butt off sitting and scalping to get there. I think I will have alittle competition and do my combo and just let one run for a month and see the difference...I'll be fun anyway......

--- 帖子 #923 ---
has anyone notice that the experts writes account equity every second under the expert tab. my computer has slowed way down since i have added this expert has anyone experience anything similar and how do i shut this off thanks

Brent

--- 帖子 #924 ---
hi all..

Im just got to know this EA works very well and plan to use it in live trading

Is that reliable to use this EA in live mini account for IBFX.

Is there any modification need to change for this purpose.

For IBFX, what suppose the setting for GMT and DST.

Anyone here has use this for mini acc?

thanks

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Edwin the solution to this is to get more RAM. I believe that is they way all EA works under MT4.

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hi Guys

Good to see, lots of different testing going on.

Now, lets see some new ideas/theories.

I'll start the ball rolling by suggesting that firebird might work better by placing  a hedge every time its gets outside the tunnel, instead of a reversal.

If the hedge goes against us then pipsteps kick in.

What do you think? will it solve the trend and news issues?

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Hey Mono I do not think I understand what you are trying to say. Can you simplify?

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Ok, Currently firebird uses a tunnel which is created by MA10 +10% and

MA10 - 10%. (or whatever you have set it at)

So you have upper band and a lower band. When the price reaches the lower band, Firebird buys, and when it reaches the upper it sells. (so its betting on the price reversing)

Now, what I'm suggesting is that, instead of placing 1 (reversal) order, it will place 2 opposing orders, a buystop and a sellstop (hedge). When that order gets filled, it cancels the opposing order and continues.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Sounds like a good addition to me. I think some form of hedging could help Firebird tremendously especially in big trends.

--- 帖子 #930 ---
Where would you propose those order be placed?  In the case of a sell order, how far above the upper envelope would you place your buy stop, and how far below it for sell?

--- 帖子 #931 ---
can somebody please post the code for Fire Bird?

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Ahh, so your saying if it hits the lower band, it triggers both orders, 5 pips away for example.  Another tunnel on the bands.  Then if it broke through to the sell stop and reversed, what then?  It goes back to the old rules?

What if we just added a tight stop loss after an order is triggered outside of the tunnel?  If it reverses soon after the breakout, it was almost assuredly false.

--- 帖子 #933 ---
I've just made a suggestion, haven't really thought it through. But something like 5 pips + spread above and below the upper/lower band depending on where the price is.

--- 帖子 #934 ---
A couple of pages back there is a fixed firebird.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Just so that I'm sure I'm clear on this and not contemplating an incorrect scenario, when the price breaks out of the tunnel, Firebird, assuming a return to the tunnel/trend, places orders contrary to the current direction.

The further the price moves against it, the more it adds to the position. (ie. pipstep)

Is this correct?

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Did you see my question above about what to do if the stop order was executed and then reversed?

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Yeah... something like that.

Take news for example, it will cross the firebird band and keep going for 100+ pips, now you dont want to take profit at +30, you want it to keep going until it exhausts itself. At news time divergence is high, so you wont set tp until divergence comes down. (Please bear with me, cause I'm kind of thinking out loud).

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Then normal pipstep routine will kick in.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Mono,

I'm following you, don't worry.

I'm not at the top of my game right now either, been a long day.  It's good to think this way though before retiring to bed.  You'll dream up the solution.

I think it's an excellent strategy to protect for news or unexpected events if we can build on it some more.

Just to throw some ideas up against the wall...

1.  We need risk management for false breakouts.  Should these buy/sell stop orders be entered with a tight stop loss?  If one of these is triggered, it's going to be under the assumption of a big move in our direction.  I don't see why we would allow it much leeway.

2.  What would we do in response to closing one of these orders?  Probably need to go back and do some research on false breakouts of the tunnel.

3.  What if we always had buy or sell stop orders floating out side of the tunnel.  They would need to be outside of the tunnel and far enough to account for the the average false breakout.  They would be constantly updated according to the current price to protect us from some major unexpected swings.

Still thinking but I'll go ahead and put these out there.

Be gentle please.

--- 帖子 #940 ---
For the constant floating stop orders, the new one would have to be opened before the old could be closed just so that split second wouldn't have a chance to get you.

--- 帖子 #941 ---
i tried all the other codes and they dont work, I try to turn on the indicator and nothing happens.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
Mono's settings (30-300-30) on M1

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hi Mono

Actually I think that may be is not necessary to have this hedging, for 2 reasons :

1) You will go to open a huge number of trades per time, actually Firebird open an average of about 5-7 trades.

2) Already exist a function that should protect from strong trend and this is divergence, but best result is to use it in higher chart time frame (i guess starting from TF30).

Keep in mind that on past August NFP friday when almost all Firebird testing here loose badly, I booked 5 winning trade (+136 pips) that is one of the highest result reached in my testing in a single day trading (just yesterday I achieved  a +150 pips in a single day). OK I know, may be it was only a question of lucky but it seems that divergence worked very well in strong trend.

just my two 0.2 pip

Sorry i still new here..i already attached this EA to my chart but no action..no trade

What should i do..

Thanks

--- 帖子 #945 ---
BenQ

Sorry - I have a blond moment here - please help me out...

15 TF - is that timeframe?

30-300-30 - ?

30 - take profit

300 - stop loss

30 - ?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #946 ---
HAHAHA......... try pipstep.

30 - ? = pipstep

TF = timeframe

Sorry, I'm in a funny mood.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Yardie's suggestion of more ram will help the slow computer problem. I did not like the way the EA constantly writes account equity because it fills up the experts log and makes it hard to spot problems and other actions quickly. I just commented out the following line of code in the EA
It is the only line of code with the words account equity in it so it is easy to find with the 'find in files' menu option.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
For the guys having problems with the EA. Please go back and read the earlier pages in this thread. You will figure out what you need to do. You need to make sure "Allow Live Trading" is selected and that the Expert Advisor Button on thje menu of MT4 is activated (green).

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Yes that's right Nvwine !

I think that it's time to start a separeted thread for fixed version of Firebird V.063G and we can start to call it as Firebird v1.0 with all these little fix about divergence, account equity printing, and so on.

What do you think about this ?

--- 帖子 #950 ---
I think its a good idea. This thread is getting long in the tooth.

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Ok so I will open a new thread soon

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Thanks Mono - stay in that mood.  a Forex trader's life can be stressful.  Feels to me I haven'ty laughed in the last 3 months!

--- 帖子 #953 ---
I'm getting more cheerful everyday I run this EA!

I am steering clear of GBPUSD for now but my results on the 30 minute timeframe very much back up what Skyline has been showing.

And for some reason I did not get beat up by NFP.

I'd like to discuss however the best times to start this EA and how often we should perhaps reset it.  Lets discuss.....

--- 帖子 #954 ---
If you have a low float why would you want to reset it? I am curious to know what is the most positions you and Skyline ever had open and the highest float thus far.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
my float ranges between 500 and 4000 USD, but the EA needs the float to work.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
I know but you are using Mono's regular settings. I believe the floats are a lot less with Skyline's test.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
I still hold a position on usdchf opened on 10 Aug with -90 pips.

Max negavite float that i can remember was about 300$ (i'm using 0.1 lot so for all usd pair 1 pip = 1$)

--- 帖子 #958 ---
And what is the max amount of orders at any given time?

--- 帖子 #959 ---
I got to thinking about resetting the EA after Mono mentioned it awhile back

Seems that maybe after large trends etc that it might be best to restart the EA in order to creat "updated envelopes".  Don't know. Just thinking about it.

I am nore interested in the time to actually start the EA.  I have several EAs going now, and it seems that depending on when they started they are all doing a little differently.  (Everyone of them is POSITIVE however).

I do want to mention that I have 4 tests going now on Firebird G (UNFIXED).  One is two weeks old, and the others about 10 days.  If I closed them all today, every one would show profit no matter what the float.  I think what we are discussing now is best pairs and timeframes, and to what degree we can increase the amount of profit this EA can return.

I am running now mostly on these 5 pairs (unfixed EA). EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD, USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
It depends Yardie, if Cgldsmth is using 1 full lot with 1 pip = 10$ , then his results are quite similar to mine. On other hand my settings are the same as Momo ones, i'm only using different chart timeframe (TF30).

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Yes Skyline your 30 minute chart versus Mono's 1 minute makes a big difference. CGLDsmith is using the 1 minute chart if I remember correctly.

--- 帖子 #962 ---
No more than 7-8 (when a strong trend is in place).

Most of time there are 4-5 order opened.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
yes I'm using M1 on two demos, but trying to open a live account now.

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Hi Guys

At the close of market I'll be showing an amazing firebird statement where inside three weeks it has managed to pull in nearly 9000 pips. (No Typo, hoping to clear 9000 by close of market today). I have deducted 1810 pips in losses, else it would have been well over 10000 pips.

The win/loss ratio is at 502-7 and the floats are at about -$1500.

Its pulling in over $2000 a week and it only trades 0.1 lots. (no money management needed )

No much more I can say about it, I'm pretty much speachless.

P.S. I hope my calculations are correct, or else I'll look like a horses ass.

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Mono is this a special Firebird version or your default settings at play?

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Same firebird, just teaked the settings a bit.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
I don't care what you look like Mono, you are just fine in my book

Just wanted to tell Yardie that I have analyzed my two favorite accounts and came us with this.....

On my TF30 chart, running EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, GBPCHF! only since Aug1, I have banked 1074 pips and show a floating loss of 243.  Thats running 24/7 since Aug 1.

On my interesting M1 test running EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, USDJPY, AUSUSD since Aug 9, I have banked 1350 pips and show a current floating loss of 349.  Running 24/7 since Aug 9.

So right now on four pair TF30 net 831 pips since Aug 1.

And on TF M1 on 5 pair net 1001 pips since Aug 9.

I just want to also say that Skyline, Yardie, Cgldsmth, Mono, are folks I run into on several of my favorite threads here.  Their comments and contributions are high calibre, and I appreciate them greatly. Thanks guys.

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Thats incedible. Time to go live ay. Can't wait to see the statement.

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Are you going to share the tweaks with us as well with your statement? Those numbers are impressive.

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Mono - great stuff. make sure you inlcude info on your "tweaks".

looking forward to it. My second demo (one week old, currently 40-0) is perilously close to its first loss, on EURGBP, but this would have been avoided with the 20-200 setting, since this pair's ADR is much less. I like Mono's adjustments according to average daily range.

thanks traderone.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Yes Yardie all will be revealed.

I've got 7 tests running with various settings and mods, but this is by far the most impressive.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Mono, are you using your adjusted TP settings for each pair (that you posted a few pages back)? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #973 ---
This is all great news guys. Thanks to everyone for sharing and testing this beautiful EA out.

Last I checked this morning on my test, I had banked about $1,700 with a float of -$180 over the last 2 weeks. This is trading 0.1 lots on 4 pairs - EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD.

Not a single loss yet.

I will post my statement at the end of today.

I don't want to jump the gun here, but if you have a large enough account to trade on regular lots that would translate into over $15,000 in 2 weeks. Not too bad.... My biggest negative float was around -$800 over the 2 weeks.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Uaooo great result Mono!

I'm very anxious to see your statement , could you post it right now with settings without to wait for market close ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #975 ---
When I first posted about it, I was at about 8700 currently @ 8998. So it booked just under 300 pips in 30 mins.

So any minute now it should crack 9000.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
laughing out loud!

are you running the EA 24hrs?

--- 帖子 #977 ---
eheheh Please Mono post it before it will break 10.000 pips !!

--- 帖子 #978 ---
yep been running 24h since the open 31st July

--- 帖子 #979 ---
9000 just past. booked another 20pips

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Wow unbelievable. Sounds like a goldmine...Sounds too good to be true hehe. Is this real money you using or demo?

--- 帖子 #981 ---
What I'm asking is : Traderseven (author of Firebird) will know how well is performing his EA ?? Or maybe he's already a bilionaire $$??

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Ok now that 9000 mark has been breached, I'll start revealing some info.

My main aim was to try and break firebird. I started with $10000 account.

The main feature of firebird is pipstep, and I know firebird works fairly well as a whole with the settings I was using, so I decided to keep the same setting but half the pipstep, to create more trades.

After the first week the float was high, but still booking in pips at an amazing rate. Then the interest rates and NFP news came in and killed some pips, it didn't look very promising. But since then ....... a pip fest.

So conclusion so far is it works very well, but needs more testing especially around news and trend times.

I'd suggest some of you guys start testing with lower pipsteps to create more trades.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Ok so are you still using the same settings tp = 30, sl=300 with chart timeframe 1M , is right? How much do you set pipstep ?

Edit: sorry forget last question , i see that you are using pistep set to 15

--- 帖子 #984 ---
skyline - Traderseven didn't allow for breathing room with TP20 SL50 settings from memory.

Mono- pipstep 15? Obviously you'd have to keep lot size very small since the large number of trades would eat margin. (however at this rate we'll all be eating fillet steak for breakfast, washed down with a swig of chateaux Latur)

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Hello to everyone,

This is my first post as i only joined 4 weeks ago and needed the time to absorb all the great information that is being freely given by some very talented and generous individuals.

I feel i have now learned enough to hopefully be of some help in the development of this ea even if it is only going over my forward test results.

Running 63g Demo with 7 pairs since Aug 3 running 24/7 until this week where it has only been on occasionally (due to losing my broadband for a couple of weeks) i have 91 wins and 1 loss, settings have been as default. Currently it is up $2,937 with a floating loss of $13.

I have also been recently testing (this week limited uptime) the tweaked 63g divergence version default settings on 4 pairs with 8 wins and 0 losses, up $233 floating loss $24

65g the timeframe version this is just breaking even, default on 6 pair.

And Phoenix v2.1 this was started the same time as 63g and is currently about $100 short of recovering from the substantial losses it took with the BOE and NFP results.

I would also like to agree with the previous posters regarding setting up a database where we are allocated differant versions and settings to test so that we are not all doing the same tests, i have been looking for a web based database system so that we could all just log in, input our results and see what everybody elses results are all in one simple db there are a few commercial versions around ranging from $5 a month or we could set up a yahoo group and use the groups db.

I also agree that this thread is getting too long, time for a new version

--- 帖子 #986 ---
The settings I use are

EUR/USD TP=22 SL=220 PIPSTEP=11 Daily Avg Range = 110

GBP/USD TP=30 SL=300 PIPSTEP=15 Daily Avg Range = 150

USD/CHF TP=25 SL=250 PIPSTEP=12 Daily Avg Range = 125

EUR/JPY TP=21 SL=210 PIPSTEP=10 Daily Avg Range = 105

USD/JPY TP=20 SL=200 PIPSTEP=10 Daily Avg Range = 100

USD/CAD TP=21 SL=210 PIPSTEP=10 Daily Avg Range = 105

AUD/USD TP=16 SL=160 PIPSTEP=8 Daily Avg Range = 80

EUR/CHF TP=10 SL=100 PIPSTEP=5 Daily Avg Range = 50

EUR/GBP TP=9  SL=90  PIPSTEP=5  Daily Avg Range = 45

AUD/JPY TP=15 SL=150 PIPSTEP=7 Daily Avg Range = 75

I think I start a new test with pipstep set to 5 for all and see where it takes me.

--- 帖子 #987 ---
So we need to find out what news cause the most damage and avoid them then. Maybe the one labelled red on the forexfactory calendar?

--- 帖子 #988 ---
At the rate of pips being booked, you dont need large lot size. Ive been using 0.1

--- 帖子 #989 ---
These are the settings for your pips generator? I think 5 pipstep is pushing the limit in terms of the amount of open trades dont you think?

--- 帖子 #990 ---
yes, you've got it right. that extra 30 is pipstep.  I've also been testing the variable targets and pipsteps for about a month.  Either way, it's all good.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Yardie, with firebird it isn't the news that cause the damage. News just pushes the trade over the edge. Most often than not the trades have been open a while anyway. Its something you cant aviod, at this stage.

Investigation ongoing.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
thanks MONO, I'm going to start a test with your above settings, pipstep 10, 0.1lots, running 0700GMT to 2200GMT, and I'll keep it running until after the next NFP.

gravy.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
That comment is only in one version of v63g that I've seen. Over versions posted throughout this thread do not print the equity. Somewhere along the line someone made that change and it got posted, but it's not part of the original v63g -- if you can even call it original. Lots of hands have had a part in it.

--- 帖子 #994 ---
So we need to close them out just before the news then. But if you can recover like you did through interest and NFP then it may be worth leaving it 24/7 even on a real account. But trending markets would be the killer

unless there is some for of hedging built in.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Traderseven gave up on firebird quite some time ago.  During testing in the early part of this thread we traded several emails and he relayed that he could never get it the way he wanted and so abandoned it.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Maybe with Mono's setting about pipstep for every currency , there nothing to worry about news

However I'm also starting new forward test with latest Mono's pipstep setup , let's see at the end of next month if we can go live

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Its hard to say, do you close -$3000 in floats and kick yourself when the news is in your favour. Or worse still no market re-action.

The worst culprit is the GBPUSD. Of 561 trades 79 where GBPUSD of which 5 where losses.

Maybe 300 stoploss is not enough.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
True.  I have a version that's been going just over a month now with a tp of 25 sl of 80 and pipstep of 15.  It creates a huge number of trades at times, but is very profitable.  My only concern with it has been the number of trades opened and the potential for margin calls.  It's not a true v63g though in that it contains a safearea.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
The one I downloaded was the one that fixed divergence and it is printing the equitiy in the "experts" tab.  What does it show the EA is calculating in the other versions?

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Or maybe we should just eliminate the GBPUSD...the risk reward ratio is poor.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
That's right, Mono.  The version I have running with a pipstep of 15 sometimes has a + $3,000 float.  And then a news even comes along and cleans it right up and pips are booked.  I'm at the point with it where I like to see a large float because I know pips are coming my way.  I do worry sometimes that there are too many trades on and a margin call is coming, so defintiely want to see more of what you're doing and your thoughts on that.

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
It's the exact same, just doesn't print the equity. Better to use the one posted with divergence fixed and just comment out the equity print if you don't want it. In fact, someone may have already posted that.  But I'm not sure if Mono is using the one with the divergence change.  You can check later, because whenever Mono posts his results he posts everything including the version he's using.  Always a nice, complete post, Mono, thanks for that.

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Start 2 tests side by side one without GBPUSD and one with but double the stoploss to 600 and see which one is better.

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Going through my statement GBPUSD with a stoploss of 450 would have acheived 1 loss 1 win and 3 low floats instead of 5 losses.

Anyway time to go (bedtime, after 2am here), I'll post statements when market closes

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
I must admit I stopped trading the GBPUSD over a week ago.  Bigger stop loss settings make me a little nervous.

I think we have a very tidy winner here if we can just run it and let it alone.  I tend to do too much messing with an EA sometimes.....

Thanks for you tremendous input Mono.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
Firebird v63g demo results from Aug 1 to Aug 17. Started using Firebird v63g-TS on Aug 8. This is the EA with Trailing Stop.

At present, on 9 pairs, open orders = 12, with float of 1,424. Since Aug 1, float has ranged form 250 to 2,200. Most days float was 350 to 750.

On $5,000 deposit, present balance is 8,759 and equity is 7,335.

Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
How many different copies of MT4 are you guys running simultaneously?

Is that how you are running the different setups of Firebird?  What is this "magic number" I keep hearing about?

Right now, I have 3 versions of v63G running and one of CyberiaTrader (another good EA if you can get it set up right, still tinkering).  It's doing ok with that but I don't want to push it as I use this computer for everything right now and I don't want it getting sluggish.

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
I currently have 9 mt4s running on one machine and 5 on another.  Everything works well.  A smattering of IBFX and FXDD.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
stupid question coming up: I've tried setting all the various TP/SL/PS levels on each pair in a nw demo, and saved each setting as a new .set file. However the EA seems to go back to the 30-300-30 settings for every pair.

what am I doing wrong here? I want the settings to stay individual for each pair, even I switch the PC off and on again.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
You need to load the new settings into the EA on each of the charts. Click on the smiley face to bring up the load screen.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
thanks yardie I think it was because I'd compiled the EA again with a 1.0 lots instead of 0.1 (the IBFX demo is apparently a micro so the margin usage is a bit unrealistic with 0.1microlots).

there's a good discussion about being flagged by banks on the IBFX forums. If firebird does as well as suggested then we'll need tactics to stay below the radar of the banks.

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Why should we be worried about the banks if we are making money legitimately? All the banks need is proof of source of funds.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Can i ask a quick question regarding EAs, maybe some of you have some insight? I always hear people talking about a broker will never allow an EA account to be successfull etc. So if you have an EA that's really profitable they'll sabotage you somehow or not allow you to trade. And cgldsmth's comment above made me think about this again.

Is there any truth to this? Don't brokers make money on each of your trades regardless whether it's a winner or a loser? For example, say all of us start trading Firebird and it makes good consistent profits, why would IBFX shut us down or manipulate prices to make it a loser? The more we trade the more money the broker makes right?

Any thoughts about this?

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
You need to trade with an ECN-type broker to avoid trade interference.  Dealing desk brokers will constantly re-quote you and stall.  An ECN broker usually charges a commission per lot, but that's a small price to pay for no interference.

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
What ECN's use MT4?

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
I don't think trading 0.1 lots per trade that any broker will have problems, especially since we are not scalping.  Some of the trades are actually quite lengthy.

Now, when our account gets to 500,000 and we start trading 10 lots per trade, they might start noticing then...... but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I just read up a little bit about having your account "flagged".

Like mentioned above this mostly happens to scalpers because their trades can last less than 1 minute. So the bank that your broker uses does not like loaning its money for you to leverage (especially if the trade is many lots) for a trade that lasts 45 seconds. So then your account can get flagged and you're not able trade as freely.

If we're placing a few trades a day and they last hours sometimes days, it shouldn't cause any problems. If we all grow our accounts to such a point where we have to trade 10 reg. lots then we might have some issues when trying to fill our orders..... That's when you open up multiple accts with other brokers and split your account.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---

Amazing performance Mono !!!

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Hey Mono thanks for sharing your results. I am wondering if you can post the dailyaverage pips movement and SL TP PIPStep for the following pairs as well:

CADJPY

CHFJPY

NZDUSD

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
These are my results from August 11th (4 hours of trading) to August 18th. Settings are similar to Mono's except TF set in EA is 15 and Percent is 0.15.

Total Booked Pips: 1830

Total Floating Pips: About 690

WINS: 61 Loss: 0

GBPUSD - 10/0

CADJPY - 10/0

USDCHF - 9/0

USDCAD - 7/0

EURUSD - 7/0

USDJPY -  6/0

NZDUSD - 5/0

AUDUSD - 4/0

EURJPY - 1/0

AUDJPY - 1/0

CHFJPY - 1/0

Next week I will add another test with Mono's custom TP SL settings.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Mono, would that 1 loss have come back if the SL was 500 or higher?  It seems like if it goes 450 pips, then it's going to be residing in a totally different range.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
MOno what is the highest that you have seen the float with this setting?

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
How do you get those statements that you post that detail all of your trades and performance analysis?

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
With the terminal window open select 'account history'. With the pointer over the closed trades 'right mouse click' pick a period if you want then select 'save as a detailed report' and you will have the report and the gif file. You can edit the htm file if you want to take out your name on a live account.

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Nice.  What would be the plan for the swap?  Even though some are quite large and eat the majority of the profit, overall it's not that bad.  Maybe just don't do anything with them -- I don't know yet.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
Yardie, You can get the history right from the MT4 history, but you have to break it down yourself. Here's a site I refer to for daily averages, etc.
http://www.mataf.net/en/analysis-volatility.htm Scroll down to the bottom of the page.  You may find them here.  There's also a good section on correlations here.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Thanks BenQ. The numbers seem a bit different from Mono's numbers though. and the AUDJPY seems like its way off.

--- 帖子 #1031 ---

How and where do you take Profit?

How and where are the stop losses?

Can it be used on other time frames besides 30 minutes?

Looking forward to your answers.

Can someone post the current code and indicator?

It would be great if there was a detailed write up of the complete system.

Doc

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Hey AutoDoc this Phoenix 1.0 Manual may help explain some of the settings.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Yes, probably.  Mono breaks his down manually and uses a different timeframe.  On that site you can get averages for recent periods.  Mono has gone further back in time to do his averaging.  In other words, rather than take a 2 week average daily range, Mono has done a year or more.  He can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe he' using a large look-back period.

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
Remember, this is an old thread and a lot of questions are answered in the thread.  Also, ideas are great, but a lot of the same ideas are being proposed that have already been tried, coded, tested and either discaded or made their way into other versions of firebird or even phoenix.  There are a few versions of firebird throughout the thread.  Yes, it would be great to have a detailed write up -- and one has been posted several times.  Search for the firebird doc.

This thread almost seems to be repeating itself.  Just my .02 cents.

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
mono

Which version of Firebird are you using?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
HI Mono,

Can you please post your Firebird Version

Thanks

Babar

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
It is posted several times in this Firebired thread. Use the Firebird that Skyline posted in one of the other newer Firebird threads..its the same thing. Settings are only slightly different.

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
I think everyone is using version G at the moment.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
OK, all ths banks, brokers have monkeys watching and some manipulating ,TO MAKE SURE THEY MAKE LOTS OF PROFITS. When they all figure out that these EA's are 90% profitable and everyone in the business is using it, then guess what? They will band everyone from using it somehow. It might be a good idea for everyone to quit posting and just use it behind the scenes. Email one another PRIVATELY. I garentee this won't last long if the the big wigs get wind of it. Most likely they already have and are working to detect it and/or manipulate in one way or another.

I took a look at your statement, and I have a question. Why do you only lose $300 when you hit the S/L with cable? If you are averaging down shouldn't it be higher? I don't see where Firebird is purchasing additional lots to average into the losing position.

I've only been following the thread casually, so perhaps you have tweaked the EA to compensate for this achilles heel.

By the way, congratulations to you guys, I have to admit I'm just a bit jealous.

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Sistercurare the stop loss was hit once. The pipstep positions are either floating or were closed as wins.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Gotcha.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
The high was at 1.9143 and was bought at 1.8650, so at 450 it would not have survived, but at 500 it would (just....by 7 pips). And would be down to about -150 pips.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
not 100% but I think at -$3200

Guys:

I am very new to FOREX........and I have been told to come over from the futures market to the FOREX because its a nice trending market that is so big that it cant be manipulated.

We all know that 90% of daytraders in futures lose money.....mainly because of lack of discipline and trying to find tops and bottoms and being stopped out.

I noticed the Firebird EA has a lot of $30 hits and just one $300 stop wipes out 10 good trades.  It looks great as a countertrend EA...but since the FOREX is supposedly a trending market.....has anyone tried to focus on a trend following EA that does not limit wins and limits the losses?

In other words....I have learned that you have to let your winners run and cut your losers.  This Firebird EA has the opposite theory of take your winners at 30 pips and let the losers stop at 300 pips.

Can you imagine how much more money can be made with a trending EA that lets your winners run with a BE+1 trailing stop once you are in the money?

Just wondering why with FOREX that this EA has a target and not trailing stop.....and why you dont cut the loses sooner if the trade is not going in your favor?

Please dont take this as a criticism...but as a learning experience.....

Thanks,

The best way to learn about firebird it to read the thread.  All your answers are there.  I think only through reading the thead will you get a full understanding of what this EA has been through and its many iterations.

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
Ben:

I did do some reading before I was approved to post here.....and firebired has definitely evolved as I read..... but....the common thread in the EA's profit and loss statement are the 30 pip wins.....I did see some talking about a trailing stop......has that panned out?

Are you using this on a 15 min or a 1 min chart now?

I am on a 5 min chart with the futures and seems to work well with my trend following setups.

I just downloaded a 90 day FDXX forex trial....and plan to start testing...unfortunately I am not a coder...but I am interested in auto trading....

Hello Joule360,

I suggest that you should read this whole 70 pages thread and think about the whole thing again.  As you already identify: Firebird is a counter-trend EA, when you are playing counter-trend, you should think differently from "trend following" technique.  Trend following: you take whatever you could from that trend.  Counter trend: you take small stake at the "pull -back" and get out of market.

As far as I know, Forex is only "trending" 30% of the time.  No matter how "optimised" you are, you can only get to 40% right the max.  When you are right, you get much more than what you lose.

Firebird is doing differently.  With Mono's setting, firebird can be right up to 95% or even hight rate.  Why do you want to cut you loss when you know that it may turn into winner 95% of time??  Why do you want to "trail" when you only aim for 30PIPs??  By cutting the loss early, you may actually destroy your chance of success.

However there may be something that can be used for you to parallel your trend trading with counter trend technique - take your profit at the time firebird enter 2-3 orders. That may be a way to maximise your profit.

Hope that helps.

PS. I suggest people to read the whole thread - it may be tiring but you may actually get something that is very useful for you.

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Thanks for the reply....I was told it was a good trending market...that is why I figured a trail would be better.  In any case....a breakeven +3 pips to cover cost or so....would be better once you get in the money.....to alleviate a reversal and a loss of  potential 300 pips.  Just seems like a lot of breathing room for a stop....but hey....I am new to forex.

Thanks,

Joules360

Mono mentioned a while back that he is using max 0.1 positions per $1000 of account.  Don't you think this should be an effective money management tool to prevent margin calls?

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
Yes, it's .1 per position, but you will have a lot of positions open. I currently have 62 open positions with this method and a float of -1822.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
Hi Mono

Can't find the answer in previous pages, so I have to ask...

Is "Firebird Ind" a version on it's own, or the same one you used with the changed take profit and pipstep etc. for each pair?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
Its the same G version with custom TP PIPSTER and SL settings for each pair.

Hey Yardie

Well I am testing the hedging EA at the moment so I am getting wins on both side of the equation (and no losses as yet). My float wen to a high of about -2K but but down to about -1.5K. My pippage is negative overall so far though.

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
So, whats your overall opinion of that version compared to the standard g.

Or is their not enough time yet from the testing to make that determination??

I have been reading this thread with some interest.  It sure is a long one isn't it

With all the reports of bucket loads of pips this thing is generating I was just wondering if anyone has traded it yet with real $, not just a demo.  I'm curious to see how it deals with the negative equity when a margin call is looming.

Cheers,

Hi, i guess this is a newbe question but... How do you use a script, just pull it to the graph, and then waht?. tnx

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
Put ReportTSD v3 OpenTrades script in the Script folder, which is in the Experts folder. From the main platform screen, open the Script folder in the navigator window. Then drag the script to any chart. An alert "Done" will appear. You will find this report file in the File folder inside the Expert folder and can be opened with your Browser, such as Explorer.

are you running this on a 1 min chart wackena? - also note that youve changed to ma timescale to 15 min. - just that ive put this on 6 pairs and not a trade yet opened in 30 mins

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
I haven't seen a lot of difference between MA_timeframe of 15 or 30. My chart is M1.

Yardie, mr.trader, Mono and others have tested different timeframes, chart selections and their comments are back somewhere in this thread.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
I am using v1c with MA_timeframe 15 and chart TF 1M, the trade start to initiated after 10 hours and create 22 trades for the next 11 hours. So far 7 trades had been concluded with postive profit and 15 pending trades.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
its ok, i think the reason was that you had 0.01 in the lots field my broker of choice wont do micro lots - changed that and it's took its first trade - lets see then

Must admit, i like the idea of the hedger but it still does not hedge every trade - with that when you think about it the only time you would lose would be if you had a 300 pip run without a single retrace - one or two 30 pip retrace's would make you around break even and more would mean profit -seems like a no brainer to me but then so many things look like no brainers till you actually run them!

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
with the trailing stop version would there be any reason for the stop to tighten?

reason:

had a usdjpy long trade and trailing stop suddenly jumped up but jumped up just 10 pips from the high and then trade got caught.

does it have anything to do with hitting the opposite band also?

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
I believe the TrailingSop works alone and has nothing to do with the envelope (band) . When t/s is triggered, it sets s/l to 5 pips below bid on Buy order and 5 pips above Ask on Sell order. Then if t/s is triggered again, the s/l is reset again by this same method.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
ahh, i see.  more of a staggered stop than a trailing one then.

Interesting

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
wackena

what time frame u use the fb-TS???

Can i ask that if you have tp set to 50 and ts set to 30 which is staggered why are there results in your report which show 10,11 and 12 pips?

did you change half way through?

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
cabletrader,

Good eyeballs. The data in the report is wrong. The script (ReportTSD_v3_OpenTrades) I used to sort the orders by currency pair , did not transcribe the data correctly from MT4 demo Account History data. The 10, 11, 12 were actually in the mid 30's.

If anyone uses this script, I suggest you check your report data.

I think that is a good idea Wackena. Thanks. SO far it looks like 63G_TS has the best returns with the lowest float.

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
USDCAD and USDJPY look really bad. Float wise.

USDCAD is best not traded on tuesday afternoons and mid wednessday.

GBPUSD has it sore spot late tuesday

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
I think the float is being caused by the fact that there hasnt been much movement in those pairs for several days now. They are prettu much stuck within a 50 pip or so range.

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Wackena

There are (2) Firebird files they are:

V63G-TS (28,560 bytes)

V63G-TS_2 (28,594 bytes)

which one did you use on your current test. on V63G-TS_2 tried to run this on a 30 minute chart it would not run however the other one does, what is the difference, as these were both posted in this forum?

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
I too would like to ask the EXACT settings for such pairs as AUDUSD or USDCAD for the TS version of Firebird G.

I think that the TP of 50, TS of 30 and Pipstep of 30 make some sense for USDCHF and EURUSD, but wonder if some different settings would be better for the other pairs I just mentioned.  Thanks for any advice here.

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
txsundevil.

I'm going senile. I don't understand your question. Is this set files or 2 different EAs. I don't remember a TS_2 EA.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Was this with default settings?

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
Wackena:

Regarding V63G-TS_2 (28,594 bytes), you posted this along with your set file in Post #1072 for download, this EA is not the same (or maybe) as V63G-TS, this EA may have a bug in it as it refuses to run on a 30 minute chart.

I have been running since Sunday V63G-TS, MONO 30-300-30 settings not using MM, 0.1 lots on a 30 minute chart 4 curriences EUR,CHF,CAD,AUD, currently profit closed $285 with $70 float, (5 positions) this is not using Money Management, of course low profit very low downside risk on 30 minute chart, have to be patient orders slow to open a close, using Money Mangement should defintely improve results.

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
still have a problem with this statement wackena

there are trades on here that do not match trading with what the ts expert is supposed to do

example:line 194 of your report

usdchf sell at 1.2378 - your target is only 30 pips and yet you said your target was 50 pips with a 30 pip 'staggered' trailer and then it closed for only 10 pips ?????

i can understand anything above a close of +25 as the stop staggers to that level on the trail.  but 10, 11 and 12??

cabletrader,

I thought i had changed all pairs to new settings. What I found this AM is that I had changed eur/usd and gbp/usd, but not the rest of the pairs. For the last FB v63g-TS month report, these are the settings I confirmed this AM.

New settings

t/p=50, s/l=300, p/s=40, t/s=30

eur/usd, gbp.usd

Old settings

t/p=30, s/l=300, p/s=40, t/s=15

usd/cad, usd/jpy, usd,chf, aud/usd, eur/jpy, eur/gbp, eur/chf

I'm going to leave this demo as is for awhile. I have a Live account with all new settings. I will compare the 2 accounts over time.

Hi all, i have a Q related to the pshycology/trading mentality envolved while using EAs during trading and would enjoy some insight/feedback : )

I'm very new to the idea of traing with an EA. I've spent on average 5 to 6 hours a day studying the currency market, and actively trading manualy during the NY morning session mostly on intraday charts with moderate success. I say moderate because on average after all the gains/losses are calculated the average monthly return is 5-6%. Up the lots traded and this could increase.

Now i dable with the firebird ea over the last two weeks, and i have even the worst case out of the three at break even, and the number one producer at a whopping 20% gain in less than a week. But overal, a few days seeing what FB is doing and any "trader's esteem" that i might have had is quickly squashed by the superhuman job i'm seeing in the FB test. (I know it is to soon to count any virtual eggs, let alone the idea of real ones in a "live" account).

Here is my question to ponder and reply to. Is this real trading? By that i mean, lets say, that by the first of January 2007 we've all tweaked FB to a point of fairly consistant steady gains. Maybe that means 15-25% a month?? How do you as a person feel about using a robot to do your trading as opposed to doing things manually? From my wife's point of view, she is excited as all get up at the possibility of getting her man back from his Chart-Mistress if FB can pull off even a quarter of the 800ish pips the top producer brought in over the first handful of test days (see this post for details.

And in the same light, is this FB thingy realy real? or are we just dreaming? I know that TraderSeven has done a great job in prior posts at keeping our feet on the ground and telling of the possible hazards of FB.

Cheers,

Thom

I am not sure I understand your question.  I do always enjoy reading your posts here on ForexFactory.

I would be delighted to let this EA make me 15-25% per month.

Is it "real" trading?  Hmmmm.  It runs on a live FXDD and IBFX account.  They think it is "real".

Maybe it boils down to what your reasons are for pursuing currency trading.

If you want to trade forex in order to tell people you are a "trader" from an ego point of view then maybe these EAs are not real.  If you want to Make Money, I think that using EAs  counts as trading.

I think what really matters at the end of the month is if your account balance is bigger than at the start of the month.  I have more than one account, and use some for EAs and at least one for manual trading.  I think they all count.

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
Just as a little addendum.  I think that most of my friends and distant relatives think that what I do (trading) is not real.

They don't think that anything that I could do from my home-office could be serious or anything more than a hobby.

I will assure everyone here that I do not care to play at trading as a hobby.  I am completely serious about this and it is very real to me.  I am open to EAs and manual trading, both which I find interesting and with great possiblilties for growth.  I find that the better a trader understands manual trading and price actions, the better he can understand how a good EA works.

@ accrete

If you wife starts nagging again tell her you swap her for a more recent model if the pips roll in

(just kidding)

Lets get our head out of the clouds a bit and look at reality.

We all know life is hard.

90% loose in forex

5% break even

5% win. And part of that 5% are banks with huge resources.

10% a month *over the long run* is considered to be good trading.

I've seen Firebird doubling or even tripling accounts in a month.

That's 10 or 20 times better than what is considered good.

If Firebird was really that good then we will be in in Forbes magazine ahead of Bill Gates in a year.

Does that sound logical?

Not to me. If Firebird would do 20%/month in real trading over a period of 1-2 years it would be awesome.

That's still good; especially when compounding.

Always keep that in mind. Whatever the tests say.

=================

@ traderone

EA trading is just as real as manual trading.

A EA is just your brain transfere into a computer. Designing a EA

requires quite some skills too. It's not just start PC select

indicator and start trading.

And even if your friends don't see it as a real job it pays your bills

so it must be work. And they talk diffrently if you park your F40 next

to their Pinto

Now we're getting deep. Down to the primordial instinct that there is always something better over the next hill. This basic instinct drives mankind to improve himself, or herself. Most can not help themselves and it is very addictive. Whether this is real trading or not doesn’t really matter. As long as the addiction and spouses are satisfied, we carry on the dream that there is always something better. If the dream didn't exist, we would not be members of this forum.

How's that for deep.

As for EA forex trading, "Trust, But Verify". The market is so dynamic, that I believe it would be very foolish to turn on an EA and walk away for any substantial amount of time. If there is an EA that can make profits unattended, month after month after month, I have not found it on any forum that I have entered.

TraderSeven, I have a question for you.

The other day I went through all the Firebird threads and I remember somewhere along the way you mentioned that you weren't too confident in Firebird because it may do well and six months down the road it may have a loss that wipes out all the profits.

I want to know what your level of confidence in Firebird right now. Would you trade it live (or are you)?

I ask because I've been demoing Firebird for a couple of weeks and I'm amazed at the preformance. But you being the original author have a good insight into the weaknesses of the system.

Thanks!

Divya

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Suzuki,

Firebird has been changed a lot since Tradersevens abandoned the project. I think even 63G is not his. Now we have versions 1.0a, b and c and 63G-TS.

Speaking of the different versions. As predicted, version 1.0b start to shine again today. It likes actively moving markets not tight rangebound markets. Ditto for 1.0a which has the most impressive float vs booked pips ratio so far.

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
Well I can't take all the credit...

I developed upto 0.65 without any letters in the version number.

I'm obsolete now and can sleep at nigh

I just recently found this thread and started following it.

I didn't test any of the new EAs.

But good attempts at fixing the weakness have been made.

Like the hedging. I can't tell it's enough or not.

I also tested mainly on D1.

People in this thread test on M1. I wouldn't even ever considered that.

But their results are damn good so it certainly has strong points.

M1 also behaves diffrently from D1.

On top of that they fixed the code that should keep Firebird out of bad trends. I couldn't because I suck at coding.

I'm never gonna say any EA is good for rael cash. That decision is to be made by the one that own that cash.

But I can say I feel Firebird has become less risky.

Trading uncorrelated pairs is a great protection too.

Real trading always is harder than demoing.

If you go life I would advis ethe following.

Stay demoing until you can visually determine there are no trends.

Earn some cash but don't reinvest. Put it aside until you have at least yous starting capital.

Then you can speed things up a bit and reinvest (part) of the profits.

That way you can still loose a lot but still hav eyou intial investment for a second chance.

I know it's temping to invest everything for huge gains but I think that will backfire. Not just with this EA but with every manual or mechanical system.

Spot on Yardie.

Are there detailed descriptions of what diffrent versions do?

It always make me feel better to know how it exactly works.

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
There is some info in the first post of the "Firebird Fixed" thread.

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
Yep.  It's all about the cash-sh-sh-sh. ;-)  I'll bet that 5% success rate among real life traders jumps to about 90% among the demo crowd.  Funny how they're playing by the exact same rules, but without the money.

As long as a trader has the ability to stop/start an EA, cut profitable trades early (a typical newbie mistake), and generally interfere with the system, then it is definitely real trading...  IMO of course.

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
I have manually traded stocks and commodities - with some success over a period of 6 months, turning £3000.00 into >£30,000. Took out 50% and lost the rest by breaking my trading rules on one single gold bet!!!

3 years later, I have started again with forex. Manual trading is real - real hard, real emotional, and real time consuming. EA trading still means taking decisions on your rules - choose an EA that fits your rules, modify one that is close, or accept a best fit. You still take responsibility for demoing = 'papertrading' but at least if you can trade without being glued to the screen, as an EA lets you, you have less temptation to overtrade, break your rules etc. But it's still real - just real hard, not real emotional or real time consuming.

If someone else's free EA works for you and you have a problem with that - send them half the profits - I have not written an EA and if I contribute I will not want paying - but the cold facts are - if the cash is real then it's real.

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
yardie - are you running the b version that has the theoretical 'bug' in it which only hedges once?

Just asking if anyone yet has a version which hedges properley. and the b1 version is the one i've had the best results with so far too. - Im trading it live on 3 pairs at 0.1 lots - ive just closed all my trades out before nfp and taken $900 in three days - amazing.

b2 doesnt hedge every trade yet so i havent started trialling it.

also, just letting you know i have devised a version that has an equity target close all trades - so basically lets say you have 10k in your account and you decide on a ratio of $500 per 0.1 lot then when you load the experts you put on an equity target of 10550 (the 50 to give you some room for closes) the expert then closes every trade when the equity is reached and effectively locks in your profit for real whilst at the same time stopping the expert from making more trades until you reset the profit target.

you then choose a suitable time to start again.

myself and a group of my collegues are going to test 6 versions in a controlled test for the next 3 weeks - we will publish our results when completed.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
Cabletrader looking forward to reading your test results. I am using the b version that Wackena released on the weekend. It is working as it should (ie hedging as it should).

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
someone said that it did not properley hedge yet? - only did the first two??

i guess youre using b2 then ?

results so far?

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Can you post your statement and settings ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
the settings were the 22-220 jobbies that were posted as set files - only ran it on eurusd / usdchf and eurjpy - to be fair eurjpy lost money because i closed all trades before nfp and ej had a lot of outstanding trades - would actually have been about another 500 pips or so had i left them open.

cant post a statement as its a live account and it's not the only strategy i play

Hello, I am new to this forum and this is my first post.

I read this thread and have seen that many of you supplied different attachments of indicators etc. to the posts.

Unfortunately I am not using the same Software as most of you are useing - so I cannot import any of the attachements / indicators etc.

Please let me know if anyone of you can supply me the whole written code, so that I can translate it into the code my software needs.

Only than I will be able to really try this system and become as happy with it as many of you guys already are.

Thanks,

Mike

If you go to the accrete's site in the previous post you can download or copy and paste into notepad.  You can open mq4 files with notepad if you want to look at the programming.

Since MT4, the software we use, is a free program I'd recommend just downloading the software and trying out the experts and indicators. With MT4 you can also look at the code with MetaEditor.

--- 帖子 #1129 ---
Hi,

I am reading and studying this forum since some time now. Since I wanted to understand the concept of the different EA's, I studied the code. Doing that I developed an indicator to visualise some events and decisions. One of the was "SaveArea" as invented in FB v0.63H2. Playing around with the indicator I found that there is something wrong with it, since it almost never reaches the blocking area, even during steep slopes. I the compared it with some posts on other threads from the inventor of this part and I found that the timeframe has to be set to 15M and not 1M as it is in the EA. Playing around with the corrected indicator, I am pretty sure that it would have prevented the EA's from the worst drawdown, since it blockes during steep slopes.

I have the modified EA attached (FB v0.63H03) as well as a MTF (multi timeframe) version of the SafeArea indicator. If you leave the "TimeFrame" setting as it is on 15M, you can use on 1M, 5M and 15M charts. It will always show the signal from 15M chart.

Have fun!!!

PS, a silly ramble. I'm laughing at myself as i look into my program directory and see about 12 folders of different MT4 FB tests. I think i need to start at post one and read the whole thread over so i can figure out which one is "suposed" to be profitable after last week's fiasco.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Thanks for the kudos JT, i like to doodle w/the html so it just made sense to try and help in such a way : )

------------Now the next bit i ask for your forgiveness in advance for my ramble and question to the group. . . It's a day off and i've been staring at charts since 5am pacific and it is nearly 3pm...here goes:

I have a Q for the group. And it is more of a general one so i'll post it here in the original thread opposed to the "Fixed" thread...haha. Not that anything seems to be "Fixed" except maybe my neighbor's dogs and cats.grin..

OK here is the Q. I'm up to about page 30 on my third read through this thread, and have read the fixed one as many times also. I am wondering if anyone has done any extensive testing on the parameters centered around the envelop/bands themselves? Even TraderSeven, in his original document stated that:

So my question is, since the location of these bands initiate the entries, do they warrent some special attention. Placing the "Envelopes" indicator out of the standard indicator selections onto a chart and doing some tweaking can give significant variations of when trades are entered. Even things such as changing the MA type away from SMA to others can vary the results greatly.

As an example, think of the Vegas model and the take profit areas? I know there are traders (myself included) that have also used the fibo-numbered-deviations with the standard envelope indicator as a take profit heads up. And if it is a heads up for profit taking, there will be times that these areas will also be opportunities to enter a new trade in the direction of a retracement? Isn't that what FB is trying to do on a macro scale? If we were to zoom out and look at a larger MA_Period setting of even something as extreme as a 288 on a 5m chart, taking trades at either the 0.38 or 0.50 deviation level, could this be profitable? This would strike some as being a FBknife of sorts?? I'm not stating that this could be useful, simply asking if it might be and if anyone has doodled with the bands/settings.??

Anyone have some insights? comments?

a PS...LOL i must not have a life...or i'm trying to create one. i just read from post 1 to this 1136 on my day off tyring to get a fresh look at our beloved FireBird : )

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
Accrete, these are great questions.  I am wondering right now if anybody has traded with MAtype set to 1?

I never have, my demos and my live account are all set to 0!  I do use a percent of .1 rather than the default .05.

Weren't you using a percent of .15?

I do think that different currencies could benefit from different take profits and pipsteps.  I'm not entirely sure that the mono ATR settings are the best, but maybe we just need MAType 1.

Thanks Accrete, now we have even MORE to puzzle over

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
I also do not know the answer to your question, so far I am running original settings in my testing. In order to make the different settings visible I have put together another small indicator which draws the channel used by FB. All settings are as in the EA. Have fun experimenting! You can use this EA on all timeframes as long as they are smaller or equal to MATimeframe settings.

Swissly

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
TraderOne and Swissly thanks for your comments. On the envelope percent i've been running 0.17, and also 0.23 and will continue testing, alongside the default settings. Next week i'll add some envelope tests to the soup and see what happens. Nothing to report yet, but visualy there seems to be some nice setups with various envelope settings. My biggest beef is in my tests this week w/63g-TS there were some no brainer entries that it missed. Any of us looking at the charts would have been in the trades and in pips, but it missed the bus.

Still doodling and testing. Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
Hi Accrete

Earlier on in the testing, I think around May or June, there were people that were testing MAType=1 and found that they were out performed or margin called, in comparison with MAType=0. The same could be said for the MA timeframe of 30 v's 15. I dont think they tested long enough with these setting to have a direct comparison.

One thing I'd like to see is a Trailing Stop via Fibs. In other words your SL would move to Open_price + 8,13,21,34,55,89.........etc. when in profit. That way you would not need a take profit setting (one day I'll get around to it ).

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
Mono, thanks for the comments on the TF and MA settings. You also stated:

Somewhere in some recent posts there was a mention of placing a 24sma on an hourly and then having envelopes out from that for TP areas. Lets say we're working on a 5m chart, so use a 288sma, then place several duplicate envelopes using fibo numbers for deviation settings such as 0.14 (you can only go two decimal places), 0.23, 0.38,0.50, 0.68, 0.85, etc. If you place this on a chart you will see that the biggie is the 0.50, if it gets to that point, it most likely is heading back to the median of the 288sma. Just something to think about.

hi guys ..

I'm new to  FB and i want to know ; does it start automaticlly ??  and after it closes an open trade , does it start to BUY or SELL alone again when there is a clear signal ??   OR  it depends on Time (to start a new trade)  ?!

and  is there a good time to switch it ON  like evening time for example ??

MaxOpenOrders=?; // This is used to limit max open orders per currncy pair chart.

MinMarginLevel = 250; // Below this Minimum Margin Level percent % trading stops. InterBankFX stops trading below 50% and FXDD below 80% Margin Level.

Hi Everyone,

I have begun to explore this unique EA Firebird in the last few days and have been very impressed with the results.  This is one of the few EA's I've seen that make consistent profits.  I ran Strategy Tester on the most recent posted version called "Firebird v63G-TS2".  It was tested using M5 (5 minute time frame) on the EurUsd for August 06.  46 total trades, 45 wins... the 1 loss was at the end of the run where it closed out the position.  Starting balance was $10000... ending balance 19978.78.  Incredible 100% return on the money in 1 month.  I'm attaching the report of the run for those interested.

Thanks to all who have researched and tested this.

Hi, anyone trading live with this expert. If so please share some results, also which version and settings. Thank you very much.

Hi ...

I'm running Firebird v63G on M1 chart from 24-8-2006 up to date ... on 6 pairs and the starting balance was $6000 ending Balance is $12450.

I increased the lot size from 0.1 to 0.2 after I noticed that it is still safe to do that.

The number of closed trades is 164.

So, the expert did 164 * 30 = 4920 Pips.

TP = 30,

SL = 300.

This is a summary of the number of trades and the pairs,

EURUSD = 12 trades *

EURJPR = 21

GBPUSD = 51

USDCAD = 25

USDCHF = 43

USDJPY = 12

For EURUSD, I accedently closed the chart and I realized that after days or weeks, so don't rely on the final result for this pair.

Note that all the closed trades are positive.

Good luck for all !

Actually I have found the USDJPY to be the most profitable in the last three weeks of so. Smashing through a brilliant 1900 pips or so!  And the USDCAD has been a great performer for me lately.

Although I must admit that historically the USDCHF has been the champ.

is this the one that has trailing stop ?

it is unbelievable,

i've been running the TS version, at least one loss trade for gbpusd

no doubt i'm gonna run this live

to wackena,

are there no different between 63g and 63g-ts (except the trailing stop)?

also,

i'm running a demo test,

$3000 mini demo account, i turned on the moneymanagement, it trades at 0.15 lot at 15cent per pip < is this correct?

or it should be $1.50 per pip?

i mean, the money managment setting is only for standard account, right?

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
Wackena,

I'm interested in running FB v63H04 with the trailing stop.  I tried to paste the code from 63H03_TS into H04 but could not get it to compile without errors and could not attach it to the chart (I suppose due to the errors).  I could not see how it differed from the H03 version.  Would you be willing to post the H04 version with the trailing stop coded into it?

1Trader2

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
I've been away for a few days and just saw your post today. Attached is FB v63H04-TS. This EA has the trailing stop function. Only works when MAtype=0.

Wackena

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Yes, the only difference between the 2 EAs is the trailing stop.

What is your Risk=setting? Example if =5: Equity is 3000, then Lots=0.15 and you are correct this = $0.15 per pip on Mini account. Standard account 1 pip = $1.50.

The money management works on mini and standard accounts. The difference is that typically 1 lot = 10,000 units on mini and 100,000 units for standard accounts.

I just went into the Piploss input value when I started the EA and upped it to 1500 instead of 500.  In fact, I did that after the EA was running and it cleared up the problem for me.

8 week update with my real account. I am now on 192 winning trades with one loss [a few weeks ago]. The account balance has grown to $7,280 from $5,000 with the Open Trades about $430. This is one a variety of 63's, mainly 63G and for the past 2 weeks, 63H03. Upon using the latter, I now use 15Min MA on the 5 Min Chart. The Take Profit as been set to 25pips and NO other interferance is given. The pairs are; Eur/$, $/Can, $/Oz, Eur/CH. This is on Interbank, who seem to very good.

That is more than I can say about FXDD. I have a few accounts open [being a trader for 8 years], but I thought another one for FB wouldn't do any harm.... mmmh..

I filled in the forms and indicated that I would open a MINI account with $4,500. FXDD say that you HAVE to have a minimum of $5,000 to open a Regular Account.

I started trading it on Monday last week, it made two trades [with 63H] both of them wins. Then nothing, no trades at all on Tuesday and Wednesday until I sent FXDD at email on Wednesday [the Interbank accounts and FXDD Demo were getting trades in this time]. All of a sudden, it started trading by having 4 trades in seconds at 8.30 [news time]. BUT, when I checked they were on a BIG Account, not a mini. I suddenly realised that I was -$770 in the red [negative/losing] and this was one an account that only had $4,500 in it.
<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o></o>
So I turned off the Auto 63H and manually traded the 4 trades. I worked out [on a 30m chart] where the Fibonacci retracement were and ‘sat it out’ To cut an even longer story short, I made money, closed them all in profit and walked away with nearly $480 for the nights work.<o></o>

But it has left a ‘nasty taste’ in my mouth about FXDD. If I hadn’t seen the trades and it had opened the full 6 pairs, I could have been wiped out in no time. If I had a normal Stop Loss [instead of 300 pips] I would have been stopped out in minutes.

BTW, FXDD didn't reply to the two emails I sent on Wednesday until the Friday, after I had logded a withdrawal form for all my money!! I did this for the way I had been treated AND also when reading this page; http://www.forexbastards.com/Fxdd.shtml<o></o>

So that's why it took you sooooo long to add the TS module!!!!     Great work, great response, great help.  My sincere thanks for your persistent determination to help traders succeed.

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
should we use default settings for TP SL ?

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
For my Live account using FBv63G-TS, I use t/p=50, s/l=300, t/s=30, p/s=40.

On FB-v63H04-TS, I would advise to use some t/p value that is above the t/s value.

Hi, but i am new to metatrader, just trying to open the firebird indicator in my metatrader:

i have put it into my custom list, but seems that i cannot open it, could anyone give me a hand on how to use the firebird indicator pls? thanks

Michael

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
Copy the EA into the "Experts" directory. Then start up Metatrader.  You should then be able to attach it to a chart.

I was able to get EX V4_2 to work on a standard demo account.

So does this work on a mini   I am up 30 pips for the day.

Doc

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
since we already have trailing stop feature, can we remove TP ? and let it run until it eventually stop out for higher profit.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
I'm wondering if some of you could do us a favor:

With the NFP coming out tomorrow the markets 'should' be flat today. For those of you that are running FBv63G-TS and have several positions open right now could you post the following sometime later today:

Which pairs do you have open and +/- pips for each.

Current total floating P/L.

Then maybe sometime around noon EST on Friday, repost the above info.

I'm running the Flyer EA right now so I'm watching that one. I was running Hendricks P4, but got bogged down with things. I've got too many EA's racking my brain right now. Either way, if some of use guys could post the above info that would be great.

"Why can't you just run the EA yourself and see what happens?"

Answer: Because my brain hurts.

Good Trades To All

wackena and other programmers,

Threre are two questions for me in the code... I´m not a programmer but the logic tell me that something is not correct there...

Here we go:

(description in the code)

Firebird calculates a X day SMA and then shifts it up and down X % to form a channel.For the calculation of this SMA either close (more trades) or H+L (safer trades) is used. When the price breaks a band a postion in the opposite of the current trend is taken.
If the position goes against us we simply open an extra position to average. 50% of the trades last a day. 45% 2-6 days 5% longer or just fail.

WHY TAKE SMA ??? I look into the charts and find that EMA will give much better signals, can somebody change the calculating method of the MA ??

//----------------------- ENTER POSITION BASED ON OPEN

int EnterPositionBasedOnOpen()

{

int ret;

double myMA =iMA(NULL,MA_timeframe,MA_length,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_OPEN,0);

double RVI=iRVI(NULL,0,10,MODE_MAIN,0)-iRVI(NULL,0,10,MODE_MAIN,1); // included by Renato

If i´m right you can choose calculate open trades based on 0 (= close) or 1 (= High/Low), what for the Price_Open is needed ?  There are only code blocs for Enter Position based on open and Enter Position based on High/Low...

How can there be opened a poition based on close ???

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
I don't how it will perform, but all you need to do in the above code is change MODE_SMA to MODE_EMA, change PRICE_OPEN to PRICE_CLOSE and then compile EA.

That's why they call it "Test and See".

Wackena:

Thanks. According to the pairs listed you are long the dollar on 2 pairs and short the dollar on 5 pairs.  I'm not sure if there will be a few more pairs open on the dollar after the NFP is released but it'll be interesting to see where these pairs end up (the ones that are long or short the dollar now) a few hours after the release. So, if you could repost these Friday afternoon I would be most greatful. As you know, the way these news releases affect currencies is anyone's guess until the release and the 'real story' happens after the news.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Hold on 'Chad'. You took this entirely wrong. I'm not trying to shift your belief or anyone's about anything. And, based on your reply it sounds as if you are the one that is taking this 'EA business' too serious. As far as my brain hurting is concerned...Have you ever restored a 28 year old classic sports car in your garage, coded HTML, XHTML, and MQL all at once, written a paper on statistical variances in growth patterns of saggital otoliths of several pelagic species,..all in the same afternoon? Yeah, think about it sport. Trading is not my only thought process.

"if u're suffering, then u're not a good trader"

Who said anything about being a bad trader? Who said anything about suffering? I've made a car payment and mortgage payment many times with profits from all the option contracts I've traded in the future markets many times...free money. I asked a favor, wackena thank you again. Chad, use a little more discretion next time when you reply to a post.

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
sorry, i know i had been a bitch.

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
Hey Palmer,

Sounds like my weekends, but my list stops after the xml. So what are you restoring?? I have a 65 Mustang coupe that I plan on going racing with... Hopefully my new found sport (Forex) will help pay some of those bills

I have read as much as i can about Firebird in the past 2 days.

Is the best thing to do, in people's opinion to:

use FXDD

Firebird V1.0C1

5 min time frame

Us/CHF

Euro/US

US/Jap

US/Can

US/Aus

$10k demo, standard Lots.

It seems like these are what people have success with the most, is that right?

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
Chad:

OK, friends? That's the way I'd want it. FF is a good place to be because everyone gets along so well so I hope both of us are here for a while.

Rusty:

I've got a 1978 Datsun 280Z that I'm working on, the last of the original Z line, www.project280z.com.  I know I know it's not a muscle car but I had one of these about 17 years ago and had to sell it when I went to school. I told myself I would have another one, one day. I'm sure if I would have had a muscle car I would have had one of those in my garage instead. I'm in the process of converting the rear drums into a disc brake system. After that the engine/tranny come out. I'll repaint it to Black Pearl since there were only 500 of those produced. I'm doing as much of it as I can myself except for the engine and tranny. I'll modify the engine some to give it a little more kick. These cars are very fun to drive and quick. I was in the market for a 240Z but the $10,000 + price tag for one that has minimal rust was too much. Either way, I've got a long way to go with it....

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
Chad,

Why not. You should try it. I'm not sure if it will work OK, so you should backtest first, then demo test before going live.

Open trades Oct 6, 2006 at 11:30 EDT.

No loses so far. Several new Pipstep orders and negative float has increased sharply.

If open order from top list is not on bottom list, then it has closed as a win.

Thanks wackena...

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
in this case, what should i do ? do i need additional coding?

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
i think this thread is mainly for original firebird 63G version, v1.0 is discussed in another thread.

anyway, i ran v1.0c for the past few weeks with IBFX live, 1min TF, i've faced huge loss. unfortunate for me. i dont know if this is the case for the rest.

Chad

Life goes on

--- 帖子 #1184 ---
Again I have a question for people that run FB live, do you guys run it 5 days a week non stop, or does anyone have it off during volatile and news times?Thanks.

Let me know if you have any suggestions, I can run test on my server.

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
1Trader2 has asked me to include Money Management routine in Firebird-v63h04-TS.

Attached is Firebird-v63H04-TSMM.

Well, I went live last week with 63h02 after getting great results in September.  It limped along making a couple wins; at least placing floaters in what I thought was going to be the right direction for the NFP.  Then BAM dollar shoots up.  All my traders were dollar short, instant 10% drawdown.  I wonder if this is the start of a strong dollar trend.  Any thoughts?

For any interested, I’m running 5 min charts on EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD with Mono’s 30-300-30 settings.

I appreciate others posting their trades, so here’s my demo and live trades. (please ignore the chf/jpy on the live trades)

--- 帖子 #1187 ---
me and you both - I'm still not sure FB can cope with strong trends, unless you have a big account or very small lots with a SL of 500 or more. I've got 15 short trades on USDCHF about 40 pips away from a margin call.

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
Has anyone had a timer set for FB to shut off during news and volatile times?

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
i think we just need some more patient,

i'm having more than -1000 pips floating, i wonder how others doing ?

this thread is going to died once ppl cant get any profits from firebird.

chad,

I've been running FBv63G-TSs Live on IBFX mini account for several weeks. I've been up over 30% and down to 18% gains. What I think is best for FB is to close all trades on Friday and start with no open trades on Sunday. Most times that I've left open orders to carry over from Friday, the next week was negative profit or at best low to moderate gains. Each time I just took what ever loss on Friday when closing all open orders, the following week had enough gains to recover the Friday loss and make good gains overall. I think FB likes to start new. I don't know if this works every week, but I think it should be considered.

Agreed.

I test FBv63G-TS and FBv63H[04]TS demo on SBFX 24 hours a day, five days a week.  Makes sense to end the program on Fridays because the market is closed, starting again on Sunday afternoons.  Even if I don't close all positions on Friday, FB generates consistent profits except for cable, which can trend to the SL.  This may change with Wackena's recent modification.

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
i thought about closing all trades before market closed too. but my low equity just stop me from doing so. I have one loss last week after 3 weeks running.

what i did is i increase the lot size every week.

0.01 lot first week, 0.02 2nd week, winning trades from 2nd week easily cover the loss from first week(maybe this doesnt make any sense). when i'm looking at this -1000pips floating this week, i'm thrilled.... wondered what to do.

maybe it's just the process of 'overall winning at the end'. i think we lose money simply because our behaviours towards trading is not consistent.

Anyway, it's good to hang around in FF, this is where i do my journal, calm down myself and make up my mind.

LET'S WAIT!

Chad

Life goes on

Since mid September I've been running FB 24x5.2 in demo.  Went live with IBFX at the start of Oct trading Micros.

In retrospect, I do think it needs to be turned off before trend-seting events like NFP or Korean Nukes.  I've let the trades ride since Oct 2nd, and now I'm facing about 23% in negative float.

I'm intrepeting some weekness in the $, so I'm staying in.  The dollar should be able to provide some good chop on the way down.

For those demo trading, I have seen a difference in the number of TPs in Demo Vs. Live.  Demo is moderately more successful than real.

does this EA still doing very well now?

--- 帖子 #1195 ---
Firebird v065tf.mq4 on first page seem like corrupted for me.anybody got working firebird on for version?

--- 帖子 #1196 ---
Hi,

Thanks for the great work.

I am forward testing this latest EA.Giving very good results.

I wanted to change the lot size to 0.1. But it is not accepting the change and taking only the 4.5 and 5 lot sizes , not suitable for mini accounts.

Please help.

Thanks.

Could someone let me know what currency pairs Firebird works best with or was designed for?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1198 ---
I found that if I can't change the parameters, I end up rewriting it from start to finish...

--- 帖子 #1199 ---
------------------------------------------------------------------

We can change to any lot size  by putting MM=0. The problem with this EA is , it is making huge loss after 4 to 5 successive gains. We may have to change the parameters.

Thanks

That sounds like something I would do.

--- 帖子 #1201 ---
Make sure at tools/options/expert advisor you have live trading turned on

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
I would really like to be able to install Firebird.Can anyone assist a complete newbie understand how to do so?I have already installed Fapturbo on my metatrader platform.Can I install firebird on the same platform.I am happy with the results of FT,however ,I was just about to purchase Maestro when I came across info about Firebird.The only problem is,I have tried installing the EA and don't seem to be able to get it to install properly.Any help would be greatly appreciated.Maybe I need a better link for installing.

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
Not sure what you mean by install it? Have you copied it into your "experts" folder yet? If not do this:

Copy the Firebird.mq4 file (right click choose copy), find the MT4 Broker folder in your Progam Files folder, go into the "experts" folder and paste it in.

Eg. - go into My Computer / C Drive / Program Files / Your Broker/ Experts/

Reload your MT4 and should find the EA in your Expert Adviser list on the left hand side.

Then just attach it to your chart and make sure your Expert Advisor button is clicked on and you should see the ol happy face.

Ps. How is Fap Turbo Performing these days? I tried it out myself about 6 weeks back but returned it after a couple weeks. Didn't like the huge losses it would sustain about every 5 or 6 trades plus in my mind with 100,000 people initiating trades at the exact same time every day somethings gotta give sooner or later (eg. brokers jacking up the spreads).

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
I had a question of my own. I just started playing around with Firebird v63H04 and the V63H04-TS. For the trailing stop version I haven't actually used it yet but I am very confused as to how the traling stop is actually supposed to work.

The default settings are Tp = 18 SL = 42 and TS = 30

If the TP is only 18 how would the TS 30 ever trigger? Does it creep up your stop loss once you are into profit?

Eg. you are up +5 pips in the trade so your SL moves to -37 pips below your entry instead of -42 below your entry?

If so seems to kind of defeat the purpose of a 42 pip SL - to give enough breathing room in case the price goes against you for a while.

Thanks

Serge

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Thanks very much for the install tip.The Fapturbo works fairly well.It was my first EA and produced pretty good gains during the first 2 months and then I had a drawdown of $163.Account had grown from $718 to about $1063 then one trade lost $163.I have gained back $63 of the loss this past week.The biggest problem is the limited times Fap trades.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.Hopefully in the long run it will pay off.

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
Wackena, I am trying out this edition of FB. The TS is engaging but it doesnt really trail as the profit goes up? It stays fixed at the point. Is this how it is supposed to work? So it secures the pips but does not increase it with favourable movement.

Thanks,

Vinesh

p.s. It trades more reliably on 30 minutes TF. On 15 TF it is not trading as reliably.

BTW 1 trade generated full profit but the other was stopped out at the TS engaged price in spite of price rising after it was engaged.

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
hi all,

im using firebird 63g in demo working fine but in my live account keep getting a Excessive loss message preventing the robot to trade anyone kind enough to send me the firebird 63g without all this annoying noise and pop up alert much appreciated.

thank you.

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
i think you need activation  key.....

perhaps the author  set privilege for live account....

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
thanks!!

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
if anyone wants ...

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
Thanks a lot roundrock. I will test this with 5 digit broker

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
Round rock :

I changed the settings as under suitable for 5 digit broker.

T/P - 220

s/l - 1000

Min margin - 400 %

Pip step - 400

Pips goal -5000

Pips loss - 5000

Rest all default settings. It is not trading yet. Pl have a look. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
Isn't this an old EA that was a total failure?

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
s/l 1000 ? does it mean 1000 pips or 100 pips ?

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
I adjusted it to a five digit broker, the s/l is 100 pips but for five digit broker it is 1000 points.

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
Is anyone still using this EA?

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
i do.

demo acc.

very impressive EA for eurusd

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
There are too many versions, which one are you using. Thank

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
v3.2 and v63G Trader Seven

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
Is any body using any of versions on a live a/c I want to test over a live a/c. Recently I tried version Firebird_v1.0a on a live a/c but it doesn't work. Help is needed.

--- 帖子 #1221 ---
hi, what do U mean " it doesn't work" ?

--- 帖子 #1222 ---
Hi all ~

does anyone has the mentioned version?

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
No  one has mentioned the right version which can be tested on a live account. I am still awaiting for the reply.

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
FB blows every acc in a trend !

This free one is much better http://www.facebook.com/breakforex

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
I tested this EA in the past,

at first sight  it looks very good but

I remember it  produced a huge drawdown,

for some reason it  only close the profitable trades

and keept the loosers,

thats why it  looks good in the acount,

the profitaility was very good besides that,

has anything been done since then to combat the drawdown?

I believe this EA could be awsome with some hedging capabilities.

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
Can anybody to recode it for MT5 ?

--- 帖子 #1227 ---
hy  i need r set file tnx

--- 帖子 #1228 ---
i will test your EA, thank you
