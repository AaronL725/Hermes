Many thanks and congratulations to Vegas on the release of his new "Vegas Wealth Builder". I don't believe enough praise can be given to Vegas for his willingness to share such great information freely. As Vegas says in his new document, "What goes around, comes around". Well, here's my prayer that Vegas will receive his generousity back multiplied many times. As everyone digests the VWB document, questions are bound to arise. Let's all use this thread to discuss the VWB. You can download the entire VWB document and the two mq4 files from here: http://www.forexfactory.com/vegas_files.zip The follow up document Vegas Wealth Builder II is attached below. And, for the sake of completeness, I've also attached copies of the Vegas 1 hour and 4 hour methods as well. Many thanks to Merlin for hosting the files on the FF server!! Dial

Vegas, After looking at the code in the .mq4 file for currencies, I see that the fib levels are measured from the 28 EMA. I was surprised by this as I expected the fibs to be measured from the median of the 24 &amp; 28 EMA's. What then is the purpose of the 24 EMA? As a secondary question of lesser importance, how did you arrive at the values of 24 &amp; 28 for the EMA's? For example in a 5/20 crossover system the 5 &amp; 20 are 5 trading days in a week and 20 trading days in a month. Is there such a basis or were the 24 &amp; 28 arrived at empirically? Thank you sir!

Question: I have programmed the "Daily Tunnel Method" {Indicators} as defined by Vegas into VT. Is there anyone here using VT that would like me to post those indicators? Models 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4. If so, will the forum accept .vtscr extensions or should I zip them? I'm sure the forum faq would inform me of this but just looking for the quick answer. B

--- 帖子 #4 ---
forum faq??? if you find it please tell us where it is! ask merlin via the website feedback to include the extension (dunno if it will allow 5 chars). otherwise just zip for now.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I noticed this also last month and am still a bit puzzled as well.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
i've had a quick read of the new document and my initial observations are: 1. looking at the charts it looks like this daily screen will work better at spotting turns during ranges rather than trends where it seems to get a pasting. it kinda reminds me of "turtle soup" in this respect. 2. the candlestick patterns he refers to can probably be substituted with jim's bar patterns from his public or private threads to similar effect. 3. i still think you can keep the weekly but use this as an intermediate screen between macro (weekly) &amp; micro (4h). he recommends using the daily for guidance in this respect. 4. what if the price consolidates on the daily and doesn't reverse? markets don't always swing from high to low and vice versa. this is just an extension of point #1. like i said just early thoughts, all open for discussion...

EUR/USD - Model # 1 AND Model #2. Overlay #2 after you have setup Model #1. Just go back and do #2. This will now produce an overlap of #1 and #2 And produce 4 fib lines on both sides of the tunnel [for a total of 8]. You will now have fib numbers calculated at 89, 144, 233, and 377 from the daily tunnel. When I pull up the daily chart on MT4 for EUR/USD with the Vegas indicator, I see on the upper left hand corner: RISK MODEL #1 (1-4) How do I overlay #2 so that 4 fib lines are displayed on both sides of the tunnel as stated above?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
You need to insert the indicator twice. Then right click on the chart and select "Indicators List". You then see both copies of the indicator listed. Set one of them to model #1 and set the other to model #2. Dial

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Yeah, I loked for the faq after my last post and found the acceptable extensions just where you said. {feedback} ??? does *.eld=ela {easylang}??? ok. will group all 4, zip and post. B

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thanks Dial One other thing............in the Vegas Wealth Builder document, there are black dots drawn on the charts. The strategy is to go short when the black dots are above the tunnel and long when they are below. How are these dots figured in? Is this discretionary? Thanks Again

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanx for the VT Stuff I didn't get a chance to ask you for it before you posted it anyway!

This is in response to questions by Dialist. Although I'm not the biggest fan of W.D. Gann, you can't ignore what the guy accomplished. One of his biggest tools is what he called "the square of nine". For those who are interested, you can generate your own "square of nine" wheel at the following website: http://xmlworks.com/gann/javascript/ On this wheel the number 169 is important as well as 13. 13 squared also happens to be 169. This is the basis of the 169 ema in the 1 hour. 145 is also an important number on the wheel, and since 12 [a fib number] squared = 144 [a fib number], this is close enough for me to use. This is basis for 144 ema. Regards the daily, there are 6 four hour time periods in a day, thus 28*6= 168. Since it is not possible to do daily charts in decimal days, therefore 28 ema. 24 days * 6 [the number of 4 hour periods in a day] = 144. Therefore the other ema on the daily is 24. It is a tie-in to the 1 hour and the 4 hour. As to why I chose one boundary level to calculate fib lines and not the median, it is simply to write easier code. In the long-run it won't make that much difference if you use either boundary or the average or the median. The difference will only be a couple of pips. So, why put the 24 on the chart with the 28? To get a better visual of the whole picture since I don't know what the trading God's have in mind when it comes to calculating the fibs [the top boundary, the bottom boundary, the median, the average, .618% of the average, .312 of the median, etc., etc.] Both ema lines give you a better visual when it comes time to ring the register on a trade. Remember 50% comes off when the currency pair gets back to the tunnel AREA. Try this URL again. http://xmlworks.com/gann/javascript/

From my understanding of the new Vegas strategy, it is, in its most basic meaning, trading price action off support and resistance. It is much akin to drawing trend channels, and then trading bounces off the channel lines, using price action to confirm the bounces. But instead of using trend channel lines to denote support and resistance, it uses fib-based EMAs. The part I like about it the most is the method of taking 50% profit at the tunnel and then letting the rest run. I'm currently using James16 price action concepts to trade daily chart bounces off trendlines, channels, and horizontal S/R. I think this new Vegas strategy would be a complement to what I am doing now.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I drew the black dots on the charts to identify the reversal patterns at the important fib levels for each currency pair. At each black dot there is a reversal of some kind that indicates the market is potentially exhausted. The more perfect the reversal, the better an indicator for a reverse in trend. I put these on the charts so that you wouldn't have to go hunting for them on your own. When you look at the charts, you can see that at almost all turning points you get these patterns at the important fib levels. Now, the key is, not every one is the top or bottom in a move. Taking small losses on these losers is essential. Discipline here is key. When it is correct, the winners are huge. Bat .500 and you make a lot of money.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Vegas, Can you shed any light on what is a good SL strategy for using the daily chart and your new strategy? I know you said in your document that you set the SL at previous highs/lows, but on the daily chart this can make the SLs huge. How exactly can we take small losses when we're working with such volatility? Thanks for your help!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Yes, this is the whole idea. I want all of you to understand the power of a model versus the weakness of a system. A system is "everybody wear black". A method is "use black and look your best". That's why I say in the VWB that after you take this initial profit at the tunnel you now have the "holy grail" of trading. A position that is a winner that you can do with as your abilities allow. If you are an experienced trader, you may want to take the remaining position and move to the 1 hour or 4 hour for timing your exit. If you are a newbie, you can just trail with a stop where you feel comfortable. There are an infinite number of exit strategies suitable to your abilities. But one thing everybody has in common: it's a winning trade.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Yes, sometimes stops can be more than 20 - 50 pips away. In GBP/USD, on a good reversal day, they may be 100 - 150 pips away. The way I handle these is as follows: 1) When the market gets to the outer fib lines where I am interested, I pay very close attention to market action during the day. If the market starts coming back more than 50% of the range for the day, I begin to think about where I want to get in. 2) If it keeps going in this reversal direction, I may start to nibble with a small position. If it keeps going I will add to the position. By the end of the day, if I'm right, I have my psoition at a better price than the close. 3) If I'm wrong, chances are the first small position I took, is the only thing I have gotten myself into that is wrong. I treat it as a daytrade and exit with small loss or breakeven, ormaybe even small gain. It doesn't really matter. I was looking for something to happen and it didn't, so I got out. Realize, that this is just my way. Others will come up with other strategies that are just as valid or profitable. For you newbies, try and be alert before the day in question, so that you can anticipate a reversal in this fib area. You don't have to wait until the close.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
From the other thread: Hi Vegas, I think I can take this as an answer to my previous post. Yes? B

--- 帖子 #19 ---
This is just my way for entry. I think what you're talking about is after entry, after the reversal day is in place and the position is on. I know from experience that if I can leave it on , without the stop being taken out, for more than a couple of days, that I probably have a good trade. I'm more concerned after it goes back to the tunnel. I will under no circumstances let a winner become a loser.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
"I will under no circumstances let a winner become a loser." this should sound familiar and allowing this to happem is what kills most new traders. jim

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Sorry if this has been explained, but how do I "load" the VT indicators posted earlier into the program? Thanks

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Assuming you mean load into VT Program... 1) Download the zip file. 2) Unzip to a specified folder. {Create a new folder if you want, just Make Sure to make note of where it is.} 3) In VT Program &gt; VT Navigator &gt; Menus{the frame on the left of the screen} Select ... Tools &gt; Indicator Builder &gt; Import Button {on Ind Build Window}. 4) Browse to the specified folder. {the one you made note of...right!} 5) There should be 4 files there, DTM_VM1.vtscr, DTM_VM2, DTM_VM3 &amp; DTM_VM4 ***Note***These are their Short Names ***Long Names*** = Tunnel Indicator Daily Model VM# 1...etc 6) Highlight one of them and click open. VT will add that indicator to your "Custom Indicator" list. 7) Repeat from &gt; Import for the other 3 files. There is no need to compile or verify these files, it has already been done. Attaching indicators to chart: 1) Left click the chart you wish to attach to. Then go to... 2) VT Navigator &gt; Trading Tab &gt; Custom Indicators... from the contextual list. 3) Left Click the Long Name of the Custom Indicator you want. 4) The Default Settings are as per Vegas. That's it. You can change the colours of the Fibs etc by Right Clicking on the indicator in the chart and selecting Properties. Sorry for the detail but I've been asked this kind of question before and since I have no idea how familiar you are with VT, I thought it best to do it this way. Good Luck and may yer pips pips boil o'er B

That worked perfectly! Thanks for taking the time!

You're welcome. B

Haven't backtested it yet but I have read it over several times and took my little side notes and key clue to pay attention to! I will backtest tommorow night. Thanks again Vegas for creating this file for us. Your time and effort is much appreciated. - S Power

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Vegas, I have your VWB all setup on MT4, and I was going over a bunch of daily charts. It seems to work very well except in highly trending markets, where price sometimes doesn't even come close to the tunnel area for a long time, and numerous price action trades that look viable would get stopped out for a long string of losses. So I imagine that this strategy is primarily for ranging markets? Do you stay out of trending markets with this model? Thanks in advance. - dnbae

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Page 10: Use the same criteria when ‘The Vegas Currency Daily’ has more than 2 losses in a row. In this case, the market is in a very strong trend. Stay with it until you reach the last fib number on the daily chart. B

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Got it, thanks, Bemac. I guess I should probably read the document another time.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
No prob. I don't think Vegas developed his entire method in a day and so it's probably going to take a little more than that to assimilate it. There is one heck of a lot of info there. B

--- 帖子 #30 ---
dnbae, Almost all very strong trending markets where the currency pair is a one-way street, you have what I call a "theme" market. Of late some "theme" markets are 1)USD/JPY, where for roughly 3 months [Sep 05 - Dec 05] it went from 109 to 121. Here the "theme" was the carry-trade. Everybody selling yen to finance anything else. 2) USD/CAD, where the natural resources of Canada [oil, oil shale, and natural gas] are talked up every day as oil goes up. For 6 months [June 05 - Dec05] you get a move from 1.27 - 1.15. 3) EUR/USD where for 5 months [March 05 - July 05] all you heard was a) growing interest-rate differentials, and b) political problems in the EU. Market goes from 1.34 to 1.19. The point is, keep your ears open for "themes". If I had given you 'Vegas Wealth Builder' exactly 1 year ago, every one of these moves was preceded by a reversal day at the appropriate fib levels before they took off on their respective runs. You would have been in at the start of each one. Yes, 50% would have been taken off at the tunnel, but the other 50% if held to the opposite fib levels would have caught a large percentage of the big move. Granted, maybe the last 10-25 percent of the move was missed while things got nuts at the extreme in the huge move, but it's not as if you were on the sidelines watching for weeks on end. If I knew at each black dot it was the top or bottom with 100% certainty, I'd have all the money in the world. Bill Gates would throw his money away for mine. In every method you must give up something to get something. You can never have it all. What I look to "give up" is market action that in the very long-run only happens once or twice [for a few weeks] every 3 to 5 years. I can live with this. What I gain in return is market action that "accepts" my parameters 95% of the time or even greater than this. With 8 currency pairs and the S&amp;P, while one or two may be in the "once-in-the-blue-moon" mode, the others surely will not. That's why in VWB I show all 8 currency pairs and explain why the S&amp;P should be in your trading plans. Surely, out of 9 choices, some will achieve the goal of building your account.

Vegas, Wow, great answer. Thank you for taking the time to explain. I think I can say that we all truly appreciate your time and effort in not only giving away your strategies so generously, but also addressing all of our questions so tirelessly. Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I know I have seen this somewhere but,how do you install the indicators in MT4 from Vegas's package.I can not find the info to install. Thanks

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Vegas, Thank you extremely much for taking time to provide such a detailed and educational reply! I really appreciate it! Now if I may impose again, I have another question. Please refer to the attached chart. I took my cue from your second EUR/USD chart in the appendix of VWB. Do I assume correctly that I would enter on the close of the hammer/hanging man? And since it is it's own recent low, to set the stop a couple of pips below it? If so, then the trade would have been stopped out on the very next bar. If it hadn't been stopped out, it would have reached a gain of 184 pips before retracing and hitting the stop. Questions: (1) How many pips above/below the recent high/low do you set your initial stop? (2) You've said you never let a winner turn into a loser. How many pips gain constitutes a winner? How do you know when to move the stop to breakeven? (3) What would you have done when the 184 pip gain started eroding away all the way back to the initial stop? I have several ideas what I would do, but I'd like to hear your answer. (4) I can see where emotions and psychology can beat up a trader here. Any suggestions on how to maintain discipline? Thanks Vegas for your generousity. Dial

Hi all, some of you might have deduced that i'm a tinkerer. One look at my crazy leaning trike and bikes you'd know for sure ( http://accrete.com/hpv/ ). . . well i'm the same in just about every area of life. ( : I'm going to post this in the VWB thread in the public forum and also in the james16group thread in hopes of feedback : ) Soooo, when Vegas stated in his VWB document: ...i just haaaaaad to doooooodle. Here is what i did. As a intro note, the charting package shown is by a company called FibonacciTrader and very nice. It allows the user to overlay a higher period's indicators onto the charted period, i.e. Daily MAs on top of 4 hour MAs. Below are two images of the same 4 hour EUR/USD chart greatly compressed. The first one shows how the 55sma on a 4 hour chart (The BLACK line) matches up almost to the pip with an 11sma on the DAILY period (the WHITE line)...and i threw in a "Tunnel" 13maDaily in Aqua for good measure ; - ) The yellow lines are the FIBO numbers off the DAILY 11sma. The outer RED lines are the 233 FIBO numbers out from the 4 hour 55sma to show just how closely the two MAs match up from the different periods...close enough to be workable i think (?) The second image is the same 4 hour chart now showing the FIBO lines from 55sma on 4 hour chart in RED, compared to the original Vegas_Currency_Daily 28ema FIBOs in Aqua. Here are the images, and then i have a question for the group below the images. I would really appreciate feedback on my thinking here. THX in advance for any comments...including "Yo Crazy Dude". I've learned one RULE in trading and life; Don't take ANYTHING personally . . . so fire away : - ) http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...SnextMAs11.PNG http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...xtMAs11_28.PNG Here is my comment and question to the group: My hope of course is that Vegas will share some words of wisdom here. I read in the VWB thread how Vegas arrived at the 24/28emas, and i will quote Vegas post here for reference: OK, so that is why they are there. Now the reason i even began this experiment is that in the VWB doc Vegas talks about incorporating the 1 or 4 hour "methods" into the Daily method using the smaller time frame charts for possible entry signals. With that in mind i share the following thoughts: It was suggested that a possible entry setup might be when there were reversal-type candle formations on the 4 hour chart to then look to the Daily chart for entry signals below or above the 24/28 Tunnel, and i understand this principle. My thought/question is, is there any advantage/disadvantage to using (as i tested/show in the above images) the 11/13 tunnel whereby the 11sma on the Daily is matching up with the 55sma on the 4 hour, seeing possible Daily candle formations at the nearby levels as the 4 hour chart is showing. My initial thought is that maybe this is not a good thing? Namely that you now simply have two indicators showing the same information?? Though i do know several traders that often trade following the 13sma on the daily charts so the "Tunnel" is close to this and it does have a working history. As you can see from both images there are candle formations with both the Daily_11sma and the Daily_28ema... though to my eyes over the last year of back-glancing, there seems to be many times larger "hits" on the Daily_11sma. ?? Here is a screenshot of two daily euro charts in mt4. Left is the standard 28ema Vegas Currency Daily, to the right is the modifyed 11sma VCD set up. As you can see there are hits on both. Though i suppose having confirming formations on the daily might by psychologicaly calming/confirming...just playing the devel's advocate, maybe that could get one in trouble? But then again, maybe it makes sense to have them correlate closer? I really do not know. That is why i posted this here for discussion. http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...1sma_28ema.PNG ...and here is another shot: http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...ma_28ema02.PNG Thanks again for any comments.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
A post script post for the above post. I wanted to keep this a seperate thought as it is a response. You may have noticed that the bottom most image that shows the two daily charts side by side in mt4 has an interesting band/candle situation. One can see that if following the standard 28ema shown at left that you would have possibly exited, or in any case have some emotions come up as the currency rode above the 233FIBO during mid Nov.2004. If one had been following along with the 11sma, the same candles that were clearly outside/above the 28ema were inside the 233FIBO on the 11sma plot. If going by the rules, would this cause one to exit prematurely? And in all fairness, looking near the December 6th selloff, would one then take profits prematurely if following the 50%PT at "Tunnel" if following the 11smaFIBO plot shown in the right chart?? OK one more example that i thought was relevant. What about in a non trending environment? It appears in this example that there would have been a more-clear entry signal shown on the 11sma chart at right on October 2nd when the currency bounced off the 89FIBO?? Where as on the 28ema the currency really didn't drop low enough down from the "Tunnel" to indicate an entry?? Much more to this than just picking "11 is heaven" or "28 is great" http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...ma_28ema03.PNG

hey vegas, ive havent used you methods (yet) but i hear high praise of you from many sources. just wanted to welcome you to the forum man!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Dialist, First, a general comment. Of all the currency pairs, I think the EUR/USD is the hardest to trade. I have some theories [maybe I'll get into those later at another time], but my experience tells me that. Having said that, your points are still valid because the same thing happens in the other pairs also. I will start by saying that I almost never wait for the close to initiate a full position. I am already in alert mode before the day begins because the market is trading at or very near the appropriate fib level for the currency pair. What I am now most interested in at this point are 2 things. 1) Speed and momentum moving away from the high or low [whichever case is appropriate] of the day, and 2) Starting with the European session [roughly 4 am est] and moving forward into the US session, where is the 50% retracement of the days range taking place. Quick Speed [or momentum] away from the high or low of the day signals pure exhaustion, and moving past the 50% mark signals this potential reversal day has a high probability of occuring. Therefore I will initiate some positions if the market can overcome this 50% hurdle. As the day wears on, if I'm right, I will add more as the market powers on ahead. By the close I have a full position with superior pricing. If I am wrong, I treat the early position as a daytrade and exit. Since by definition the reversal didn't happen, the market is still in the same general fib zone, and start over again the next day and repeat above. Question 1) My initial stop is at least 10 -15 pips away from the high or low. This has to be done because of large hedge-fund and bank stop hunting. Yes, they will occasionally come get us there at that level, but it is harder than just 1 or 2 pips under or above the low or high. If I get taken out within a few days, then the market has to continue to trend against my original position, otherwise if it was just a stop hunt I'll get back in again if it goes back beyond the original high or low. Example: I am long EUR/USD and market low is at 1.20 for the move. My stop is at 1.1987. Market trades up a little and starts to go lower. If 1.1987 is taken out, and then EUR/USD starts to rally again, somewhere between 1.20 and 1.2010 I'm going to get long again. Question 2) I don't have a specific pip number, but the more important point to be made is this: Don't carry a LOSING trade very long [certainly not day after day]. When you do have winners [30 pip minimum] start raising the stop. When you realize that your entries are all exhaustion moves at the outer fib levels, then you understand that this position should go in your direction very soon. When it does, don't let it come back to bite you. Granted, sometimes the market will come back and get you, but that's part of trading. As a matter of principle, though, I ALWAYS have a portion of my position on until it either 1) hits the maximum profit objective, or 2) gets taken out with a breakeven stop. If I lose 150 pips of gain on this last portion and get stopped out at breakeven then so be it. Question 3) Portions of the trade would have stops underneath to protect some gains. How much and where depends on skill level. But even a relative newbie would love to have this problem: "Where do I put my stop or stops to protect a 150+ pip gain?" I'm betting not many haved asked themselves this question anytime soon. Question 4) The absolute BEST way to maintain discipline is to be UP on trades. I want my entries to be important, in the sense that the market is at a critical juncture and if I fail it will at least impart information that is valuable to me and for my method. Failure [losses] gets punished by being cut loose, jettisoned, shown the door. It's something that isn't allowed to hang around and wear on you. It only lasts a very short period of time. In this way you can deal with it effectively. You can be clear-headed and objective. It simply wasn't time for the market to reverse [But, when you do, ohhhh baby, am I going to be there]. Hope I successfully addressed some of your thoughts.

Merlin, Just when I thought all my relatives had given up on me!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
accrete, You have grasped an important concept from the VWB. It makes logical sense to assume that if the daily chart is at the outer fib levels, then the 1 and/or 4 hour methods are probably there also. They will have different fib levels, of course, but you can't discount their significance. That's why in VWB I included the example of GBP/USD. Notice that the high on the 1 hour came at the outer fib level before crashing [left part of the chart], just as the daily is hitting the 4th fib level. I think your instincts are basically correct.

Has anyone programmed the 4 fib lines in Intellichart script, as used in FX Trek Intellicharts ? I've been trying to work out how to do it.. but no luck so far. I would really appreciate any advice anyone here can give me on this one. Thanks !

Bemac, This is just my humble opinion, and it's only for the VWB. 1) S&amp;P 2) GBP/USD 3) AUD/USD 4) EUR/JPY 5) EUR/GBP Tie for 6 6) USD/CAD 6) USD/CHF 8) USD/JPY 9) EUR/USD

loudoniii, I have used intellicharts a long time. But for the life of me, I can't figure out how to write a script that works on their platform. I've contacted FxTrek, and the only thing the support team does is wish me luck. I'm with you on this one. Probably the biggest reason I do most of my charting on Metatrader 4 now.

Thank you Vegas for all the answers to the great questions in this thread. I have read or more accurately wore out each of the Tunnel Docs you have written and the VWB is on it's way to dogear status. What has been especially valuable to me, is your candor in your answers to the questions in this post and you selfless nature and attitude. While I'm nowhere near where I want to be in this game, everything you have written, that I have had the honor to read has solidified my journey and takes me one step closer! Thanx again! HeavyJ BTW: I think in two of your model manuals I have read that you could "write a book on risk".........anyway......I would like to a Vegas Doc on that someday.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I'm an eSignal user. Any idea on how to enter these fib levels onto a chart? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
HeavyJ, Not a bad idea, I'll give it some serious thought next month. Since you brought up risk, one thing that I would stress [and ask you to think about] is the relationship between risk/reward and the price level of the market at any given point in time. I believe firmly that NOT all price levels impart enough information to determine risk or reward. What I want is for the market to be at that inflection point where very minute price changes yield large amounts of information as to potential future direction. Think of this in mathematical terms as a parabolic curve. Let the X-axis be risk; the Y-axis be reward. Where do I want to be? Obviously as far out on the curve as possible because very small changes in X yield huge changes in Y. This is why it is critical as a trader that you have patience and keep your powder dry. You want to trade when your method tells you the market is at a very critical juncture. If you are right, whopping gains. If you are wrong, relatively small losses.Unfortunately, most traders can't wait. They find themselves having to push buttons. In VWB that is precisely our goal. Identify potential reversal scenarios because they have the highest probability of success.

Let me add my thanks as well Vegas for all your help! I especially have enjoyed the 4 hr model and am really connecting. AFter going through VWB and looking at the charts and where you are attempting to get in, i have a question. Looking at Chart no. 2 (EUR/USD from Feb 11 to july 20 2005. It seems that you arn't able to participate in most of the move. It reminds me a bit of when i kept trying to find the bottom over and over and missing the major trend. If you fail to get in, do you continue in the main trend direction with a new entry or do you patiently stay out of the market until the next reversal signal? Is missing some of this trend the "price" of folowing this system? Thanks again Vegas!

Thanks Vegas! There is some really good stuff in your reply. So much so that I've printed it and have it taped near my monitor, so I'll be reminded to re-read it for a few days.

Hi Vegas, I understand that VGB is a TA and does not take Fundamentals into consideration. However I believe the following quote from today's Thomson's Newswire could be construed as TA. [15:49 FX OPTIONS: EUR/USD More 1.2000-1.2200 DNT"s Expire Next Week] London, January 20: Yet more 1.2000-1.2200 Double No Touch options are slated to roll off next week, inclusive of a Monday NY cut expiry. 1.2000-1.2200 DNT"s expired at today"s NY and Tokyo cuts, in the wake of prior recent 1.2000-1.2200 DNT expiries (inclusive of yesterday and last Friday). EUR/USD has traded north of 1.2000 since January 4. 1.2185 represents the 2006 high-to-date (Jan 6, post-NFP). Further topside exotic barriers reside between 1.2200 and 1.2300, inclusive of triggers at 1.2250, and 1.2270. A number of 1.2200-1.2300 exotic barriers are due to expire through month-end/early February. Greenspan"s farewell FOMC meeting is on January 31, with January"s US employment report published on February 3. Question: Do you ever take this type of information into account when you are looking for an entry point? btw. if anyone can explain {in layman's terms} DNT Options, I would be just a little bit wiser.

Vegas; Thank you for answering my prior post. This time i took the idea that the VWB DAILY was the primary "Tunnel" we were trading off of, and then tweaked the MA/FIBOs on a smaller period chart, in this case the 4 hour chart. I did another one of those FIBO correlation studies on the charts i've been useing, where you can overlay a higher period's indicators on the current period's chart. In this case i took the VWB Daily 28emaFIBOs and overlaid them on a Four Hour chart. I found that a 144ema closely (within 4 pips each FIBO/MA) matched the Daily's 28emaFIBOs/MA. So i'm thinking this might be an alternate set up for looking at the 4hr chart for price action/candle formations near the longer period's (the VWB Daily chart) for confirmation of entry?? and the possibility of a tighter stop loss looking on the 4hr for such things as tweazer tops/bottoms, evening/morning star formations etc at the FIBO's that now correlate with the VWB Daily?? Worthwhile study? Am i loosing it? Here is the screen shot of my chart MA correlation study: http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...28vwbDaily.png A secondary Q to all this is; Would you (in general) look at the One or Four hour formations/setups to better place your entries while trading the Daily charts? 4hr charts would keep the 6:1 ratio going? Does that make sense?

I made a very simple error in the VT code I posted which will affect any currency pair with a price format of ###.## {Trades to two{2} decimal places}. The bands are way too tight, here are instructions on how to edit the code. {relax, it's very simple} 1) Attach Model # 1 to any chart. 2) Right Click on any one of the Indicator Lines. 3) Left Click "Edit Indicator" {Opens a New Window with the Code} 4) At the top of the code, there is a definition for "Pipfactor". The line reads as follows Pipfactor:=IF(C&gt;500,0.25,IF(C&lt; 50 And C&gt;10,0.01,0.0001)); The Line SHOULD READ as follows... Pipfactor:= IF(C&gt;500,0.25,IF(C&lt; 500 And C&gt;10,0.01,0.0001)); { That's it, Just add a zero {0} to the 50 to make it 500.} 5) Left Click Save {the floppy disk Icon} 6) Close Edit Window. 7) Best to remove &amp; re-attach indicator to chart to ensure it is updated. Repeat for Models 2, 3, &amp; 4. Rather than having multple Versions kicking around by reposting for a one click fix, please modify the code. B

Hi Bemac - For your VT code, model 2: C&gt;500,0.25,IF(C&lt;50 And C&gt;10,0.01,0.0001) Would the currencies based in JPY as follows: C&gt;500,0.25,IF(C&lt;50 And C&gt;10,0.1,0.01)? Just wondering - model 2 is funky on the pairs based in JPY. Thank you

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Bre____? This is a cut/paste from post # 63 {2 above yours} Post # 63 has more detail. The Line SHOULD READ as follows... Pipfactor:= IF(C&gt;500,0.25,IF(C&lt; 500 And C&gt;10,0.01,0.0001)); { That's it, Just add a zero {0} to the 50 to make it 500.}

Did anyone apply the new dialy method with the old 4hr method? I am having trouble understanding how to incorporate it - S Power

In the Spirit of Vegas note in his original VWB document that experimentation on the theme was encouraged, i share the following. Here is a snip from a post i have over in the PF on the subject of taking the VWB method on the Daily chart and correlating the Daily FIB levels over to at four hour time frame. ---snip: Below is an image of a standard risk model # 1 on a EUR/USD 4 hour chart. All settings are standard "Knife" settings except the zanny colors ; - ) (the Knife is a mod of the 4hr method) http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...tock_knife.PNG Below is an image of the same EUR/USD 4 hour chart this time with a 144ema and FIBOs that corresopond to the VWB Daily chart's 28ema FIBOs with a setting of risk model # 1 (the yellow dotted lines are 34 &amp; 55 emas that i like to place on my 4hr charts): http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...44emaOn4hr.PNG Below is an image of a standard VWB Daily chart set at risk model # 1 : http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...k_VWBDaily.PNG You can see there are correlations between the lower two charts that might assist in choosing entries or stop-loss levels. ----end. ---another snip from an additional post: Here is a screen shot on the three charts mentioned above. The left most is the stock "Knife" 4hr, middle is the 4hr VWB 4 Hour Mod, and the right most is the stock VWB Currency Daily. I see the VWB 4hr mod as just another indicator that may show some correlations/convergences...is it another feather in our caps? Time will tell. For myself, eye see it as a mediator/communicator between the Short Time Frame 4 hour stock "Knife"/Vegas 4hr method and the Larger Time Frame Vegas WB Currency Daily chart. (LOL just saying the 4hr chart is STF makes me laugh...6 months ago a LTF chart was a 60min in my training!!). The 4hr "mod" is not a replacement of either, and as stated above, it is just another indicator to point out possible convergences between the two time frames that may allow for better entries and tighter stops, yet gaining possible larger pip limits as i can set my profit target off the VWB Currency Daily chart's FIBO lines/ extensions. And since i am not a "mechanical" trader, this additional information combined with old/new school technical analysis based on convergence/formations/price action may assist my trading style. One last thought on the last sentece above about my not being a "mechanical trader". When i first heppened upon the Vegas 4 hour method las summer i was not looking at something that would get me into trades "blindly". What i was amazed at (and still am) is a FIBO channel's "magnatism". So for me the FIBO Tunnel was all about technical analysis and not some robotic-software thingy that would tirgger trades while i enjoyed a walk with my wife on the soggy Oregon coast. LOL. I'm a non-mechanical, discresionary trader at this point in the game. I like to get my hands dirty when i trade, i like to play in the mud ; - ) Playing is a big draw of trading for my personality. I realized i need to take responsibility for my future and trading is a good fit...but if i give up my entries/exits to a purely mechanical system...have i attained my goal of "taking responsibility"? Hummm. maybe that is ripe for a comment from the TradingPsychMaster FifiTrader? Happy Dooooodlin' Thom P.S. for the record, my tweak w/the 144sma on the 4hr tunnel is just another "indicator"...i don't trade off it. http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...ogethernow.PNG For those who wish to check out the 4hr mods on the original VWB Daily indicator save these into your mt4 indicators folder: Vegas VWB 4hrBase.mq4 this is the 34/55/89 "base" model w/Yellow lines (place on chart first) Vegas VWB 4hr.mq4 this is the overlay model for Risk 1-4 (then place this and change risk model to your choosing)

Hi Thom, It would seem we are both intrigued by plotting the DTM on faster time frames. This is a cut/paste from my post to VTC forum a few hours ago {see post 2 above yours}. "The Indicator will plot a "CLOSE APPROXIMATION" of the Daily Tunnel Method on charts of lower timeframes. {the average of 576 closes on a 1 hour chart need not be the same as the average of 24 closes on a Daily chart. [24 hrs in one day, 24hrs*24ma=576]}" You may have already noticed this as it is shown in your ScrShts; Daily 24MA =1.2031. 4 Hour 144 MA = 1.2020. Please understand that this is only a point of information and that I agree with you on looking at it in shorter timeframes. It helps me to easier visualize ~ how much time till a critcal level. That plus I don't think anyone is going to pull the trigger merely based on price touching a fib line. At least not if they are trading DTM. It would be interesting to get some feedback on this idea though. I wish I understood mql more. {a lot more}

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi B. I too hope that no one "is going to pull the trigger merely based on price touching a fib line". As you would agree, the FIBOs are there to give a heads up and a few pips diff between is no biggie since the goal is dozens or even hundreds of pips for a take-profit target. Here are some links to mt4 tutorials that were posted by someone in FF: lessons 1-15 http://www.forex-tsd.com/lessons/671...-part-4-a.html http://www.forex-tsd.com/metatrader-...st-script.html http://www.forex-tsd.com/metatrader-...templates.html

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Accrete, and thanks for your reply. I guess what I am trying to say is I tried trading the daily bar by bar as a test and got many fake candlestick paterns resulting in losses. I traded exactly by the rules, so when you get to loosing trades wait for the price to return around to the tunnel. So at that point I decided to take it back on my foundation, and am thinking, wait, with the 4Hr Method, if we get a positive slope on a bullish week momentum calculation, yet we see a reveral on the daily, we got a problem. And also, how do you determine the reversal. Do you wait the following day for close of the next bar for confirmation of candlestick patterns as suggested by most proffesionals and books? (In other words, wait for confirmation) or do you go ahead and anticipate the confirmation by the turn of the 4hr hour, disregarding the bullish momentum. At this point it just becomes so confusing. Im willing to listen though! Thanks. -S Power

Hi xsP, I'm to new at the daily candles to have any words of wisdom based on personal experience. What i do know is nearly every profitable trader i've met trades them (and often include looking at the 4hr for entries/SL). I've been facinated w/the FIBO channels since i learned of Fibonacci sequence in trading so i was naturaly drawn to the VWB daily and the older V4hr chart layouts. As stated, i'm too much of a hands-on guy to by to "systemized", I like doing my homework and such. Tonights break out of the EUR/USD from consolidation was a good example of doing homework and being ready...although it was such a classic no-brainer of a move that any chimp with his hands on a mouse could have gotten in.

Read the VWB document and have daily charts setup on the GBP, EUR and CHF. I have two questions. Using MT4 and Vegas currency daily indicators. I'm having trouble understanding the relationship between the 1H and Daily charts ( As to what to look for, etc ). Also, I assume that the setup on the hourly charts are the the daily ( ie. GBP/USD having 5 fibs using models #1 and #3 ) System thus far looks amazingly accurate on the daily charts ! Thanks, Ronald

I think it depends on the broker. Interbank doesn't have it, but Strategybuilderfx and Northfinace do. Just download the copy of metatrader from their sites to get access to their feeds.

Ok guys im a newbie with a newbie question but here goes: I just installed mt4 so I could try Vega's Wealth Builder but I cant for the life of me figure out how to import his files into mt4 I did find this earlier post about the subject but was hoping someone could do a little importing 101 w/mt4 for us dummies

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I am assuming you have a file with a .mq4 extension. If so, then to install it simply copy the .mq4 file to the following folder: C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators Close MetaTrader (if it's open) and start it back up again. On the menu bar click "Insert" and then indicators and then custom. You should see your new indicator in the list that appears. Click it to include it on your chart. Dial

Check out this screen shot i took this am (jan 24th) of EUR/USD pair (red lines/arrows are my additions for this example): http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...01-24rsibb.PNG Here is what eye-see. I've been using this indicator on my "other" charts for several months. The idea of having an indicator inside bollinger bands was introduced to me while reading John Bollinger's "Bollinger on Bollinger Bands" book. I then added a matching period sma. You can see that the indicator clearly showed the reversal. Seeing the reversal is not a problem w/this setup...KNOWING how FAR the reversal will go? Well that's up to the Lady with the crystal ball ; - ) Here is how you set this up in MT4: 1) Start with a fresh chart of your choice 2) Apply an RSI and set for whatever period you wish (the above is set at 8, i have several FX friends who trade using the 9...i just happen to like FIBO #s ) 3) Apply "Bollinger Bands" to the indicator's window (i.e. drag the BB into the RSI indicator window 4) Under "Apply to" set to "First Indicator's Data" other wise the BBs will show up on the chart window. 5) Apply a "Moving Average" and set the Period to same period you have set the RSI, and also do step #4 6) Now before you do anything else, save this as a template...something simple like RSI inside BB's ?? There you have it. I like this indicator for an exit indicator. When the RSI line (Aqua in my example) crosses over the (magenta) SMA i exit a portion of my trade, if not all of it. OK, NOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD THE DOTS which are drawn at each candle-rsi reading: I'm doing this in a seperate step because some will not want the dots on the line. Here is my reasoning for having them. I like the visuals that the dots give me in the form of "V"s and upside down "V"s. The dots just define the move for my eye. If you wish to have them on your RSI follow all the above. THEN, place go to the RSI in the custom indicator folder and click "Modify". First thing to do is a "save as" something like "rsi dots"?? Then "Complile" it and it will show up in the "Custom Indicator" list. Now apply it to the chart by dragging it into the same window as the current RSI. You won't see anything different if you have it set to the same period. Now you change some code: Find this area on your code: //---- indicator line SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_LINE); SetIndexBuffer(0,RSIBuffer); //---- name for DataWindow and indicator subwindow label ...then change it to read: //---- indicator line SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_ARROW,EMPTY); SetIndexArrow(0,115); SetIndexBuffer(0,RSIBuffer); //---- name for DataWindow and indicator subwindow label Go ahead and hit "compile" again and the dots should show up on the chart indicator. Now save that template again and you are set for next time you wish to apply this indicator to another chart. Hope this helps, have fun tweaking the periods. Thom

HI, I can't be at my computer during the day so I can't scale in as Vegas mentioned earlier. So should I wait until the close of the day for confirmation or reversals such as doji, spinning tops?

Hi Zen, my bad. I had forgotten to emphasise the importance of step 4 now in bold on the original and mentioned here also: Here is how you set this up in MT4: 1) Start with a fresh chart of your choice 2) Apply an RSI and set for whatever period you wish (the above is set at 8, i have several FX friends who trade using the 9...i just happen to like FIBO #s ) 3) Apply "Bollinger Bands" to the indicator's window (i.e. drag the BB into the RSI indicator window 4) Under "Apply to" set to "First Indicator's Data" other wise the BBs will show up on the chart window. 5) Apply a "Moving Average" and set the Period to same period you have set the RSI, and also do step #4 THX for the whack on the side of the head to get me thinking straight! Cheers

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi accrete , My problem is with step : 3) Apply "Bollinger Bands" to the indicator's window (i.e. drag the BB into the RSI indicator window I can not figure out how to get the BB into the RSI window.If I try to drag the line from one window to the other I get the indicator pop up. It will not let me drag in the indicator list?? Thanks

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Zenophyte, when your dialog box comes up after you drag to the window, where you can change settings like "apply to close, open, etc., you'll see "first indicator's data". Apply that one, Ktrade I forgot to mention to open up your Navigator window and your indicators and drag. Sounds like you're dragging from one indicator window to another.

Doing some testing and present day testing I realized that if I somehow imply the 4hr with the daily that it will contradict the "find the bottoms and find the tops theory" behind this model. How? Well I find everytime I get a sell signal on the 4hr that the daily already has been either at the designated fib level or farther for a long time. Has anyone implemented this with the 4hr model? Can you please tell me if I am trying to mix cat and dogs in one cage? -S power

I just wanted to interject a thought here. The VWB doesn't have indicators. Vegas is a very good trader. If the VWB needed indicators, wouldn't Vegas have included them? I think the focus should be on watching price action and taking advantage of reversal price action occuring in conjunction with price having touched the designated fib for the currency. The name of the game is finding high probability trade setups. All indicators are based on price and are therefore lagging. Price is real-time. Price is King! Who needs indicators? The combination of fibs and price action as described in the VWB, in conjuction with discipline and proper money management is more than enough to trade profitably. Adding anything else just muddies the water. Just my two pips worth (micro) Dial

--- 帖子 #95 ---
lovin it!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Totally agree Dial...once indicators start being used then you will soon notice how they lag. This is not to say that you cannot trade VWB and use indicators...many ppl like to have something there as a confirmation once the other criteria for a Vegas trade is attained. Try it though and see they will generally lag. Mind you...if they don't then that will surely be another story.. My problem is going to be seeing the price action but I also think with a bit of patience and practice I will get there. BTW I think the Bolly set up is great and perhaps another thread and some trade action would be interesting..... just my micro mini pips worth!!! : Cheers Antra

Hi Everyone, I'm a newbie here and I have just started to read the VWB posts. I've installed the metatrader model for the 4hr chart. I noticed it has models 1-5. I also noticed that the daily script has models 1-5. On the daily charts the VWB says to over lay models 1 &amp; 3 for the GBP charts. Should I over lay models 1 &amp; 3 on the 4hr chart? The information I have is not very clear about what model to use on the 4hr chart. Also, is there a model for the 1hr chart set-up that I can download? Thanks Dave http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ons/icon12.gif

Excuse me. It may be that because I didn't join this Forum in the summer of '04 I will be told to sit down. Then so be it. ____Some thoughts____ What is the point of this discussion? Is it merely an effort to educate readers in how to read Candlestick Formations? If so, I've done that and therefore this thread is exhausted for me. If, on the otherhand, it is a Forum for discussion on the Vegas Method and how to possibly identify when to be "leary of the uptrend" [post #80] then perhaps people should not be asked to use Tunnel Vision. Perhaps, also, VWB does not have indicators as that would require additional Models to accommodate the Output.[in mql] Do you think Vegas became "a very good trader" by simply cloning someone elses method? I don't. I think he took the best of all he could come up with to build it. Is it as good as it can be? I don't know, but I'm willing to ask. Post #42 by Vegas Dialist, First, a general comment. Of all the currency pairs, I think the EUR/USD is the hardest to trade. I have some theories [maybe I'll get into those later at another time], but my experience tells me that. Having said that, your points are still valid because the same thing happens in the other pairs also. I will start by saying that I almost never wait for the close to initiate a full position. I am already in alert mode before the day begins because the market is trading at or very near the appropriate fib level for the currency pair. What I am now most interested in at this point are 2 things. 1) Speed and momentum moving away from the high or low [whichever case is appropriate] of the day, and 2) Starting with the European session [roughly 4 am est] and moving forward into the US session, where is the 50% retracement of the days range taking place. Diallist, it may be time to re-read that printout you have taped near your monitor Personally I would like some input on this from Vegas before I make my decision. Respectfully

Hi Scott, I hope that you don't sit down! You add alot to this forum! I hope that I speak for several of the recent posters, but if not I will speak for myself. I am a huge fan of Vegas. His methods so selflessly shared, have set me on the path and provided great focus on my strategies. His generousity in sharing these easily provable models is absolutely truely unique in my "limited" experience. Of note in his models, his attitude towards "allowing" experimentation is pervasive. but........ he also tells us his attitude and approach to the model. I am very interested in the discussion of this attitude and approach. A probe into the mind of a successful trader, who shares his methods. Sometimes when something new like VWB is released. We all rush to tweak in stead of study the merits......I'm not saying this is bad! I'm just saying that it would be great to understand the merits, make them work, or prove they don't before making them better.......with indicators....that absolutley do lag price action. Can they add confirmation? You bet! They will tell you what has just happened. Price action can give you an edge....PA like lagging indicators of course are never a sure thing. Dial's work on the 4Hr Tunnel is brilliant IMHO. He has honed a great modell into a great system! The Knife! In his teaching in the PF he shares his understanding of the Vegas model which is astute. He adds tweaks which help make the system more powerful. His tweaks are necessary and yet only serve to enhance the system. These tweaks I am sure came to him after his understanding of the V4T model. Now Vegas seems to have a preference for candlesticks. I switched to OHLC bars some time back, because of James Hearndon's Preference. I did not want to miss the translation in his teaching. Which is superb. I am modeling VWB in this fashion. I hope to accomplish an improvement with this simple "tweak" because the spirit of the VWB doc implies "price action at the right time" to me. IMO you can't get a better handle on what price is telling you than what James teaches. Accrete has been very energetic in his further develope ment of Vegas models as applied to shorter time frames. I am not demoing those right now but I am monitoring the FIBO 15min model..... looks promising...I think this is great work! Just not for me right now! When I asked the question "Has anyone ever heard of a method called the 4hr Tunnel?" In post one of the "Lost in the Tunnel" thread, I was hoping, in my mind to generate discussion on the merits of the V4T,pure. As it happened it morphed into other aspects. I really didn't mind as this is a public forum. Some of the tweaks were helpful. Isotonics work was great! His momentum indicator and Tun lines live on my charts today. Some of the stuff just did'nt make sense or serve to enhance my understanding of the model so I just sorta let it go in and out. To make a short story long...... I have to admit that a personal preference of mine would be to have this thread dedicated to the Vegas Model PURE. The threads with system developements and tweaks could be easily moved to another thread. I know I would frequent both......and benefit! See ya friend HJ

Very well said HeavyJ. All I was expressing in my post was my opinion and preference to discuss the pure VWB. I just failed to express that explicitly. I also wish I had also thought to suggest the excellent idea of a separate thread for those like Bemac who have good ideas and prefer to experiment and seek improvements. There is value in both approaches and each group can learn from the other as you so eloquently said. Having separate threads would add clarity by the simple expedient of having separate topics in separate threads. Mixing both dicussions in one thread becomes confusing and lacks focus, to me at least. But then, I'm not the sharpest brick in the pie, now am I? Dial

Hmmm... Maybe you missed it. Just incase you did. The entire Method is Based on a 24 MA Lagging Indicator. I'll wait for Vegas' opinion, if you don't mind.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
[quote=diallist]I just wanted to interject a thought here. The VWB doesn't have indicators. Vegas is a very good trader. If the VWB needed indicators, wouldn't Vegas have included them? I think the focus should be on watching price action and taking advantage of reversal price action occuring in conjunction with price having touched the designated fib for the currency. The name of the game is finding high probability trade setups. All indicators are based on price and are therefore lagging. Price is real-time. Price is King! Who needs indicators? The combination of fibs and price action as described in the VWB, in conjuction with discipline and proper money management is more than enough to trade profitably. Adding anything else just muddies the water. Dialist, In all my years of trading, both on the floor and off, it never ceases to amaze me how people ALWAYS want to complicate something if they can possibly find a way. When I was on the floor, I used to have people stand near me mumbling all day about how in 1948 March wheat put in this same kind of formation as Swiss was about to, and that we were about to go down 150 pips. Did they sell? Nope, because some 2-4-6-8-10 oscillator they had in their pocket just came in with a veto override. When the market finally went down, how many were they short? None, that's how many. They pay so much attention to the indicators, they have lost their ability to listen to price. Here in Las Vegas, I used to golf with a doctor, who when he found out who I was, begged me to teach him how to trade. He said it could not be that simple. A month later he had Yen charts going back 20 years taped on his living room walls. His wife was appalled. Since he was a doctor, his superior brain power would win the day and he was bound to "clean-up". Once again, ignore price action at your peril. In any type of trading endeavor [forex, stocks, anything] all that you can hope for is the marble game. Five marbles in a bag; 4 white and 1 red. You pick a marble. If you pick white you win $200, and if you pick red you lose $100. Here's my point: if I played this game with you [and I'm certain you would if I agreed] would you then start dreaming up other "conditions" that would have to be present in order to play the game, e.g. we must play at your house or only in daytime between 9 - 5 pm.? KISS [Keep It Simple Stupid] always has been and always will be the preferred method to make money. I said in VWB that you would come to find implementing this tough. Why? Because the market will be MOST bullish at the top and MOST bearish at the bottom, and your emotions and brains will get in the way of you making money. As I write this, gbp/usd has put in a reversal day at the outer fib number. The market has been very bullish lately, with "experts" all over the place predicting future price action. All I know is that I got my signal and I'm short [like I described in a past post] with stop above the reversal high. Will I be right? I don't care, because I did what I am supposed to do. I am simply picking marbles out of a bag.

Hi all. What a great read through these last few posts (94-106) ! I wanted to share something with the gang just for the record... I know that there are many posts by myself on "tweaks" on the 4hr and vwbDaily, though most of my tweaks are simply myself trying to find a correlation between possible currency target-levels I.e. The FIBOs. In one particular post was the mention that I am a discretionary trader, and not a "system" or mechanical trader. For myself, I rarely use anything other than FIBO data combined with candle-formation/price-action to enter a trade. I will, on a separate chart, have my RSI mentioned back in post #84 as my preferred "exit" indicator. Other than this indicator I rely mainly on formations/convergences as stated...even when looking at the 4hr method last week i was in a EUR trade prior to what the stock 4hr "model" recomended, i entered because my set rules of trading counter-trend-line breaks took place. The chart on the left is a 4hr chart with FIBOs set at 144 to match the stock 28 primary ma on the VWB Daily. As mentioned, in this example of a demo trade, i was looking at PA on a 4hr time frame to validate reasons to enter a trade that i would set my profit level off the VWB Daily chart. You will note that i changed some of the wording, such as the "Warning" to "Caution Zone". The red lines are manualy drawn trend lines, the yellow lines are my demo-trade entry with profit (set &amp;) taken at the daily's 1.2291 FIB level. (When i entered the below trade the stock 4hr on 55ma was screaming "Warning" as the ma's had recently crossed. So why did i set the 4hr chart below w/144ma as primary? My reasoning is this; IF my primary chart is the longer term Daily chart, and I believe in the Daily's MAs to be set correctly, then i will modify/set my smaller term chart's MA to help me visualize the chart's price action as it relates to the LT chart.) : http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...01-224hr_d.PNG It was/is my intention when sharing my thoughts on correlating the FIBO levels between time-frames to show graphically which ma#S on a particular time frame matched within a handful of pips, the same levels on a larger time frame. I figured that I was not the only one that had the desire to know the answer. . . And found that a 55 ma on a 4hr chart matches closely to an 11 ma on a daily chart, OR that a 144 ma on a 4hr chart matches closely to an 28 ma on a daily chart. These were simple observations on my part and a desire to share what I'd learned while doodling. In each post I later added a disclaimer-statement that I did not trade off the modified "models", that they were simply additional "indicators" to assist me in trading off longer time frame charts that I was trying out at the time. I will state that the shorter time frame FIBO tunnels which I quickly adapted from the original 4hr model were successful during a period of time in late 2005 on time frames under 60m for grabbing an average of 18-20 pips a day for several weeks during the experiment in my demo account while trading live-demo during the NY open session. The reason I am here (and specifically in the PF) is to learn to trade the larger time frame charts which is something I have been fearfull of as my initial training was on very short TF charts even down to 1m. Eye-see the future for myself MUST include trading from LT charts if I am to have a life at all outside the home w/family and friends. Bottom line? I'm a nice guy at heart simply sharing what I've learned while doodling and would never wish that anything I shared was cause of someone loosing even a pip of profit in their trading. For myself, and I state again, FIBO levels facinate me, and seeing a correlation ACROSS time frames helps build my confidence when going into a trade. I'm here to learn, share, and meet some like minded people hoping to make a better life for family and friends : - )

From Vegas: "I will start by saying that I almost never wait for the close to initiate a full position. I am already in alert mode before the day begins because the market is trading at or very near the appropriate fib level for the currency pair. What I am now most interested in at this point are 2 things. 1) Speed and momentum moving away from the high or low [whichever case is appropriate] of the day, and 2) Starting with the European session [roughly 4 am est] and moving forward into the US session, where is the 50% retracement of the days range taking place" Thanks vegas for your generosity. Iam new to forex and would appreciate if anybody can explain #2 above. Specifically on 50% Retracement. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #110 ---
accrete, I hope my response to dialist isn't what prompted your post. If it is, then I apologize for being unclear to everyone, especially you. My point was to share my experience about people who always have to add another indicator to the list before they trade. They can never seem to find that perfect trade and are thus paralyzed by indecision and fear. I did not mean to imply that anyone who "tinkers" with 'Vegas Wealth Builder', the 1 hour or the 4 hour tunnel methods, or the fib numbers are in this category. Quite the contrary, your responses are well thought out and worthy of study. My hope in all the files I write is to see people do exactly what you have done. That's why in VWB I made special mention of the fact that I knew this was going to happen and that I very much encourage everyone to "tinker" away. To everyone, including accrete, I want to make it perfectly clear that your "2 cents" on VWB, the tunnel methods, or the fibs are valuable. Nobody, especially me, has all the answers. So, please keep plugging away.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
dpatloll, I will explain. First, the market is trading at the extreme fib numbers. This should put you on alert, because this satifies the first condition of putting on a trade. The second condition is some kind of candlestick or bar-chart reversal pattern. I go over the most reliable reversal patterns in VWB. I now shift my focus to the day's trading. During the course of the trading day which starts in Asia, the market will obviously have a range between the high and low of the day. Whatever this number of pips is [high-low] I am interested when it starts to get close to 50% or mid-point. I probably could write a book on 50% retracements, but suffice it to say it is an important day-trading tool on reversal days. Why? Because by its' very nature reversal days have to penetrate this level before they can continue. If this level is NOT violated, a reversal day is a moot point. When markets violate this level during Europe or US trading, the probability of the original move continuing the rest of the day is very low. Well, if that's the case, then we have the "perfect storm" brewing for a reversal day. In my book, this is worthy of partial early entry for a position. More can be added later in the day or the next day if I am right. If I am wrong, I treat this early position as a day-trade and exit. This gives me superior pricing, on my position, relative to just entering on the close. I hope this clears up the concept.

Thank you Vegas for a most illuminating reply. I really like how your words are like a searchlight, piercing the fog and clarifying what is important. I've heard the marble analogy before, but this time it took on new clarity and definition for me. Thank you! I look forward to your posts here for as long as you are willing to visit. And speaking of visit, I am really looking forward to any critique you may have of the "Knife" system as I present it in the Private Forum. And, in reference to that, I would like to make a request of you. If you find that any of the changes I have made to your system, or if any of the replies I've made in the Knife discussion thread are off target I would really appreciate being corrected. I don't care about being wrong or even having it pointed out on the forum. What I do care about is the welfare of the subscribers who read and follow my section of the PF. I want to be as sure as I can that they get only the best information that will help them become good traders. So when you visit, I will truly welcome and be thankful for any critiques and comments you feel you should make. Thanks Vegas! Dial

I have a question about the reversal day and the 50% retracement. If I'm understanding you correctly, you have a reversal day with an appropriate candle stick formation that closes. On the following day are you looking for a 50% retracement of the previous days range? For example, the crrent GBP daily chart has a doji formation for yesterdays close, 1.25.06 GMT. Would you be looking for the 50% retracement on 1.26.06 before you entered a short position in this case? Thanks Dave

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Okay, this part is perfectly clear to me. What period of time defines the days range? When does it begin and end? Are you just looking at the high and low that occurs between the opening of the Asian session and the opening of the European session? To my understanding, that only covers a 7 hour period. I need to see if I'm understanding your definition of the 50% level. If the Asian session opens at 1.2100 and the European session opens at 1.2150 that would be a range of 50 pips. Are you saying the 50% level is at 1.2125? Or, are you taking the range from Asian open to Asian open (24 hours) and taking the mid point of that range? I want to be completely clear how you are defining the days range. So if the previous days' range was bullish, then you are looking for a bearish move past the 50% point of the previous days range. Is this correct? On a bar chart, I'm visualizing the price of the current days' bar falling below the mid point of the previous days's bar. Is that right or wrong? How much is "partial"? In other words, what fraction of your full position do you start with once the 50% level has been breached? Providing I'm understanding your definition of range and mid point, I should be able to place an entry stop order at the beginning of the European session, and cancel it if it hasn't been triggered by the end of New York trading. If this is the case, then I would only need to create these entry stop orders if the target fib level has been touched. I'm sorry to be so picky, but I feel this is an important concept and I require full understanding of what you mean. Thanks for your patience. Dial

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Dave, No, I don't wait for a reversal day that closes. I wait for the market to get to the fibs and then I look for market action that tells me a reversal day has a high probability on that day.

Anytime from the start of Asia and you get to approximately 60 pips or more [this is for gbp/usd. Obviously it will be a little different for other pairs]. From here a 30 pip move would be needed to violate the 50% rule. The higher the range, the more dependable this 50% rule becomes. 2) The previous days action has no bearing except that it hit a fib level. 3) How much is partial? Depending on how aggressive you want to be, I'd define it somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 of your normal trade size.

Hi Vegas, How do you get the end of day S&amp;P 500 charts in MetaTrader? Which broker do you use? Is Globex a particular broker or a source used by many brokers? Do I assume correctly that your broker is the source of both your currency futures and s&amp;P data? Thank you sir!

Hi Accrete, As I stated earlier, I prefer to keep things simple and as close to the original Vegas documents as I can for fear of straying too far. As a subscriber to the PF you have had opportunity to read both the original Vegas 4 hour document, and my interpretation of it in the "Knife". I'm sure you'll agree that they are almost identical. But all that is just me. As a PF subscriber, you also know that I encourage experimentation to come up with possible improvements to the system and to make the system fit each individual better. That is why I was very happy when you posted your analysis of Fibs correlations across time frames. In fact, your "tinkerings" are so good, they prompted me to ask Merlin to expand my section of the PF to allow you and others to start new threads. I thought what you posted in the PF was (and is) worthy of having it's own thread. I hope to see more good posts from you, not only the fib correlations, but more on your short term application as well! Thanks a ton and very much and all that appreciative jazz type stuff!! Dial

Dial, To get an S&amp;P chart in metatrader 4, do the following: 1) with your charts up, go up-top to tools&gt;history center and then click on the daily S&amp;P 500 to import the daily information. 2) Then go to file&gt;open offline and a box pops up. Click on S&amp;P 500 and the daily cash chart will now be opened. It will be updated every day after the close. Sometimes you have to close the app and then get backin to get the update. Globex is the electronic exchange the Chicago Mercantile Exchange [CME] trades currency, short-term interest rate, and stock index futures. The futures are on a March, June, September, December cycle. I recommend InterActive Brokers as my first choice to trade currency futures through Globex. Spreads are usually 1 pip but sometimes they can be 2 for the majors. Round-turn commission is $6 with no minimum volume/month requirements. This is the best deal you can find with a major house. As I have said before, I dont' know why anyone would trade spot forex with a 3 pip spread when you can trade futures [eur &amp; gbp] at 1 pip spreads and $6 in fees. You can take a look at IB by going to the website http://www.interactivebrokers.com I suppose you can use a different data-feed, but I just use the default cash feed that metatrader provides for S&amp;P 500.

I'm a bit of a newbie at your method and I'm still trying to understand the reversal day and 50% retracement. After the market gets to the approperiate fib level on the daily chart, are you looking for that days candle to give you some type of reversal pattern? You also spoke about the range (high/low) of the Asian market to the open of the British market looking for a reversal. Sorry but I'm a bit confused about when the reversal day takes place and when I should be looking for the 50% retracement. Dave http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...cons/icon5.gif

Thanks Vegas! There must be something wrong with my MT4 setup. When I go to History Center, all I can see is a Forex folder containing 19 currencies. There is nothing there for S&amp;P 500.

I'll give a kick at this Dave because I would like to know if I understand it too. You watch on the daily chart for a trade to meet your first set of parameters ie; Jan 23 the GBP broke the third fib line. Then you go to the hourly chart and look for the Japan open(1AM GMT Jan 23 on chart) and look for a reversal ,5AM GMT Jan 23 on the chart.Draw your FIB from the low to high and when it breaks the 50 % retacement enter the trade short.

I've been studying VWB and I think I see a setup. I was wondering if someone could confirm for me. Attached is the daily GBP/USD. It looks like the price is around the 3rd fib line and it also looks (to me) like a reversal candle setup. I've taken an idea from Vegas' 4-hr method and I've put in multiple entries and I'm going to take multiple exits. I work all day so it's hard for me to keep an eye on price action so I've put in staggered entries and it is my intention to have my entried stopped in as long as price is going "my way" and take profit whenever the price crosses a fib line. I'm doing that in order to "lock in" profit and as Dial has pointed out in a previous post, price does not always cross the tunnel. http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/7073/cable8lr.th.jpg [img=http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/7073/cable8lr.th.jpg]

Hi Vegas, I have been studying your 4H and VWB daily for some time. It looks great and accept my bunch of thanks for all your efforts in sharing it. I would like to know what % of your account you risk for entries getting thru VWB daily. I understand that these positions could stay for couple of days if it runs in your direction. If suppose, I'm planning to do just the VWB daily, you might do only a couple of trades in a month. I'm curious to know what % of my capital I could risk for these entries. Thanks ! Shan

Greetings Vegas, No your response did not prompt my post. I felt i needed to share that since i had posted so many tweaks, that i in no way wished anything more than just maybe some light bulbs going in our fellow reader's noggins as to how great-and-powerful your concept of using price action combined with FIBO levels away from a mean-average. I'm humbled to be able to hook up and be a part of such a terrific group of people and able to glean so much from you all ! Cheers

Huge thanks to Vegas. I'm using MT and have a question for anyone with MT programming experience. I've seen other indicators that have data info in the upper left hand corner of the chart such as previous high and low, previous and current day range, and I would like to add the 50% (for the retracement) if possible. I would like to keep all the info that the current VWB indicators provide. I would also like to add the other info, but not the rest of the indicator(s). I'm just trying to stick to the original indicators without adding a bunch of lines that probably won't get much use. Is it possible to do this? At this time, I have no experience with programming. I plan on going through the tutorials, but since I'm just starting, learning to trade is the top priority. High and low can be found in the data window, and range can be figured out easily enough, but I'm just trying to make it as easy as possible (especially using various currencies).

jkjk, try these. the shimodax indicator is for your LDN and US session ranges. time set to 0 if you're using GMT MT4. Change the colors(1 and 2 different than 3 and 4 to differentiate the sessions.) The prev hi/lo is self explanatory. I think the time is set to 0. (I don't use this) Both should bring up your highs/lows in the left hand corner of your chart. I also included a cam. Set it to 0 if MT4. This should also give you #'s on your chart. Cheers, ktrade

Just wondering how many people moved their stops to "break even" based on the fact that news was coming out on the dollar? After getting up to 90 pips on the GDP and 65 on the EUR, I was very tempted to do so, but held tight. I guess the real question is, when are you guys moving your stops to "break even" based on VWB? For me, I’m waiting for a full ATR move on the dailies, before adjusting my original stop loss.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I got taken out at b/e. I was up over 100 at one point. Next trade. Glad it worked out for you. Could you explain more with the atr. Thanks, David

My VWB GBP/USD short got stopped out on the 90 something pip upward spike this morning. Fortunately, I had moved my stop to breakeven yesterday. I re-entered at a better price this morning and am already 100 pips in the money!! Just out of curiosity, did anyone else get stopped out at breakeven or perhaps a small loss on a trailing stop? Just curious how everyone is doing the VWB. Dial

ATR = Average True Range (ATR) is simply a moving average of true range calculated over a number of days. True Range and Average True Range are common volatility measurements. The larger the True Range, the greater the volatility of the stock. I currently use a 14 period ATR, currently the daily ATR for GBP is 123 pips and 90 for the EUR. With this in mind, I will not move my Stop to break even until price moves atleast 123 GBP or 90 EUR pips in my favor.

Hey Dial, We musta been singin' out of the same hymnal! I was stopped at be on friday news. (Cable) additionally I had a secondary knife buy stop order in (Weekly trend direction) the 20 pip filter ended up just above the swing, where my original stop was. I thought this might be a good VWB counter trend move. When the "news spike" failed to breach the 233 DF or the swing bar I cancelled the 4hr order. Watched as momentum increased to the daily range 50% ret and re- entered. up about 100 right now! lovin it! I'm movin Cable stops to BE and parkin! My euro position never stopped out and half was taken off at the tunnel. 135 pips. Good day all HJ I'm gonna send Vegas a lobstergram!

Great start for me with VWB system. I went with the below trades.. Short EURUSD - 1.2238 SL - 1.2335 1/4 position - Closed at 1.2110 near tunnel Short EURUSD - 1.2228 SL - 1.2335 1/4 position - Closed at 1.2110 near tunnel Short EURUSD - 1.2207 SL - 1.2335 1/2 position - Moved SL to +50 Short GBPUSD - 1.7810 SL - 1.7945 1/2 position - Moved SL to +50 I'm planning to run the balance positions on fiber and cable to see if price is able to pierce the tunnel and go down further. I understand entering the trade getting the reversal signal from VWB is very crucial to get a very good entry price and to keep your SL low. Since I entered late, I had to keep my SL wide enough to cover the recent daily highs. Still wondering how much % of capital to risk for every trade for the VWB enteries. Currently I went with 2% per position.

Hey Dial, I added a 50 pip trailing stop on THIS morning but left my stop at the original buy-in stop level, of course I'm at work and can't access my account to see what happened and now after reading all this its just killing me to find out what happened (even tried to call home and see if the wife was home so she could look for me!!).

KTRADE, Thanks for the reply and the indicators. The cam you included had the values I was looking for in the corner, but when I install it, I lose the EMA and fib values. The Previous High and Low indicator, draws lines but doesn't show the numbers. I'll play around with it. I just thought I ask the thread before I try to change any of the indicators because they work great as is.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Dont know if anyone watches for patterns, but i thought this was interesting on the daily u/j chart. Bearish bat per Scott Carney's parameters lining up with vegas fib. Have a great weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
GBP/USD I didn't get stopped out because I left my stop 17 pips above the high of the pin-bar which was also on the other side of the 365ema. I didn't move my stop to b/e until price hit the tunnel. It was also neat to see the pin-bar that James teaches coincide with the new Vegas Wealth Builder. Pretty good first ride for me, I am playing 5 micros on each half with my first half taking almost 200 pips! Scott

--- 帖子 #147 ---
yes the pin bar is a great tool when used with this/these systems. i dont think the word great does it justice. its that powerful with this. dont stop in much over here but coudnt resist this one.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
jkjk -- oops! I forgot about the fib levels on the chart! I've seen people put all of their info in one line at the top horizontally but not sure how to do this. (anybody?) Good luck, ktrade

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Just wondered has anybody tried substituting the fib lines with BB's set at 1, 2 or 3 deviation points? The 20 period MA acts as a tunnel similar to the 24/28's and they adjust automatically for each pair so there should be no need to fiddle with fib levels.

Dialist and everybody else, This is how I handled todays trading action [Friday, 1/27/06]. Our average trade size in cable [gbp/usd] is 1.5 million [20 globex contracts]. Our average short price on this trade is approximately 1.7891 basis the futures contract [spot rate and futures rate are about even right now]. This morning about 7 am est, cable is at approximately 1.7770 - 1.7780. The high for the day, at this time, is 1.7831. I put a buy stop at 1.7827 for 50% of the trade [10 contracts]. I figure if the market makes a new high [I am assuming GDP and housing numbers will be dollar negative] we might go test the recent highs since this is a Friday. If I am wrong, it's a moot point. Since we have an approximate 60 pip gain from our entry to the buy stop on 10 contracts, then we have from that same entry on the other 10 contracts an approximate 50 pip loss to the other buy stop at 1.7939. So, if all hell breaks loose on the upside, we will end up with a very slight profit. When the number hits for GDP the market immediately start jumping and our buy stop at 1.7827 gets filled at 1.7829. 10 minutes later it's putting in the high around the 1.7880 area. Now, I know that if we go higher then everything is already in place so I have no worries. But, if the market goes back down below the old high of the day at 1.7831 this thing is in trouble. With the new high, a 50% retracement puts the market at approximately 1.7820. A violation of this and warning bells will start ringing in a pro's ears loudly. So, when the market busted 1.7840 on the downside, after the housing number, I put a sell stop at 1.7819 to treat the 10 contract buy as a day-trade if hit. It got hit. So we lost 10 pips on 10 contracts so our effective cost on our short of 20 contracts was lowered by 5 pips to 1.7886. Near the close, I covered 7 contracts at 1.7679 to book an approximate 200 point gain. I did this because a) the market came about 10-20 pips from the daily tunnel, and b) I did have a daytrade loss to cover as well. Throw in weekend positioning for good measure, and it makes sense to me. Before the close I readjusted the buy-stop on the remaining 13 contracts to 1.7761. Now the fun can begin. One more thing. Not this weekend, but the next weekend [after the payrolls report] I will put out a detailed file on exactly the method I used today. It will clear up any confusion you may have as to why I did what I did. It will allow you to do the exact same thing.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Now that's worth printing. Thanks Vegas. Very enlightening that your early Long Stop was determined by technical support and not breakeven+1. Even more, it was 1 pip below support suggesting you do not allow for 'noise'. I have a question. How do pit traders keep track of all those various S/R levels or whatever they are trading off of thoroughout the session? Do they have handhelds or a really sharp pencil or what? B

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Bemac, I'll address these questions and a lot more in the file next weekend. It's not what you think it is, but I really don't want to get into it here because it's too involved for a forum response. It's not complicated but it's going to take some time and effort to explain to you thoroughly. There's a whole bunch of stuff I'm going to introduce to you. I want you to be able to visualize the movement in your sleep, so that when you get what the market did today you know exactly what to do. I think after you read it you will agree. The pits aren't what they used to be. For the financials, they really don't exist in the same sense they did even 10 years ago. Electronic trading dwarfs, by volume, what goes on in the pits. But when they were important, most locals [at least the experienced ones] knew their methods in their sleep. They were so in tune with what they knew they had to do, it was truly a reflexive response with very little ,if any, thinking involved.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Good stuff Vegas. Thank you. It will take me a bit to wade through your post. I look forward to your detailed file after payroll next week. I cannot thank you enough for your sharing. Dial

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Vegas, thanks for the time/info in your post 151 above. Very interesting, and enlightening for me and here is why: For months i had been trading the NY morning session off shorter term charts such as the 10m and 60m, then i came across the 4hr Vmethod and the FIBOs intrigued me as they do today. Then your VWB Daily came out. Since looking at the longer time frame charts (and being back in demo mode after 50% draw down in an account on the short-term methods) I now find myself adrift at sea without a rudder...I used to get up, stare at the charts from 5am Pacific time to noonPT, now i really don't have direction for my trade day due in part to the longer-TF charts i'm looking at. Maybe that makes no sense? But when all you've known of trading is 10m charts for entry, and 60m charts for profit taking, i just need to get a new "groove" again. So i will await your "file" next weekend with eagerness and surely there is a waltz within it's pages? Cheers, Thom

Hi Dave, Vegas has published three systems: Vegas 1 Hour Tunnel Method Vegas 4 hour Tunnel Method Vegas Wealth Builder They are three separate systems, but in Chapter 3 of the VWB document, Vegas explains how to use the VWB daily fib breaks and reversal bars (black dots) as a guide to getting better trades with the original 1 hour and 4 hour systems. Because the 4 hour and the VWB are separate systems, you should put the VWB risk models on the daily chart, and the 4 hour risk models on the 4 hour chart. If you mix them up, you'll have a mess. For your and everyone's convenience, I've just attached the original 1 hour and 4 hour system documents to the first post of this thread. So now, all three documents are in one place. Hope this helps, but ask more questions if it doesn't. Dial

Last summer i did some testing w/multiple BBs on a single chart after reading John Bollinger's excellent book "Bollinger on Bollinger Bands", though in my testing there didn't seem to be a reoccuring "trigger" with the bands. Even J.B. states that a "touch on a band does not mean to sell or to buy"...and that is pretty much what the charts showed, not much consistancy. The other thing i do like about the FIBO levels (in my case, off a 144ema which matches up w/the VWB Daily 28ema ) is they give me visuals on take-profit levels at the time of entry. I have a template/profile for my 4hr charts that gives me all fibo levels in real time and i use this info when entering a trade to set profit limits, stop loss etc: http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/J13G...7fiblevels.PNG

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi Accrete, I don't understand how you are using the fibs on your chart to determine stops and take profit levels. Is this related to the Vegas 4 hour system, or is this something of your own? Would you be willing to give more detail? Thank you sir, Dial

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Dial, "Thank you sir" LOL silly guy, making me feel all 48 of my years with that intro. OK, In your discussion on the 4hr model you show the TP levels at point of entry on your example chart. I just took that and ran with it (wrong or right this is how i interpreted the original Vegas 4hr document) . When i enter a trade i look at the fibo levels on the chart in my example image, I also look at where the currency has been and see if there are reversal patterns at a nearby FIBO such as TB/TTs etc...and then i will place my stop-loss beyod that fibo by 10 to 15 pips in case the currency goes back to the recent High/Low and tests it. No rocket science, just trying to figure out a workable system for stop loss and profitable limits. I usualy set and forget the trades and don't get greedy, (although i am begining to use trailing stops for the final portion of trades) realizing, as in your setup discussion on the 4hr, that i could move the take profit levels as they do move with the fibos. I know that this is a bit of mixing the 4fibo w/the VWB but it was working for me in the 4hr method, so i figured it should port over to the daily. (remember i'm back to demo trading these days so this ain't real money i'm playin' with). Does that help clarify my post?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I entered 4 staggered positions. I got "stopped in" to my first position and got stopped out with a loss of 50pips. Then my other 3 positions got "stopped in". Took a 100pip profit when price crossed the 89 fib line. Still got 2 positions open. I'll take another profit when it crosses the tunnel and I'll let the 4th position run as long as it wants to. Even if the price turns around now, I've moved my SL to breakeven so I'll end with a net +50pip gain.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks Vegas for sharing this great method. I get stoped by the trailing stop set at 60 pips in all the trades - long USD/CHF and short on EUR/USD, GBP/USD, but per total I had 146 pips (83+39+24). Why everybody is speaking only about GBP/USD and EUR/USD? The setup for entering long onUSD/CHF wasn't correct? Did I entered this trade by mistake? If so, I would like more mistakes like this

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Christian, I think the swissie set up was solid! I just missed it! and your right it never looked back. Congratulations! If your interested here's how I missed it. When I miss a set up I don't chase it. I just wait for the next! Congrats on a good day again! HJ

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I am pretty new and I didn't read yet about James' method. Hope to do this soon. I entered looking at 4H candlestick charts and using something similar wiht accrete on post #83, but substituting RSI with force index. The funny part is that I discovered this thread in the same day I entered the trades. After I read the posts and the document from Vegas, I added the indicators to the chart and I almost did't believe what I've seen. Everything looked so clear and simple. Sure not all the entries in future trades using this method will be so easy, but this particular case give me more confidence, just when I needed it.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
This puppy is lookin' ripe! I don't have a handle on Vegas' Asian range yet but I "Think" (uh oh) I get the concept. FYI I'm using the range from @ Tokyo open to London open and finding 50% ret of that range. anyway heres my 2 pips! HJ

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Iv'e been wondering this myself and the apparently parodoxical shift to electronic platforms with realtime charts which would give boneheads like me a chance! I can't imagine competing against Larry Livermore in the Bucket shops! I am so humbled by these cats...... Vegas, your reply was most satisfying! Thank You HJ

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Also GBP/JPY looks interesting to me. On the daily chart it touched the fib line, and on 4h chart I see a doji evening star and bearish divergence on force index. I am not sure if it is enough to enter, but will see on monday. How can I insert an image hosted on my computer?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I also dont quite get the 50% ret on the Asian thing, nor the zooming down to shorter time zones in order to optimize the entry timing. I hope Vegas will have time to comment further on these points.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
There are different rules which could be added or applied but this is the general idea of my thinking. I would like to hear feeback.....I am pretty firm in this tho it needs to be backtested for profitability. HJ

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I think that several of us are sorta grappling with this concept. I believe I'm getting an "inkling" of an idea but I would hate to send someone down the wrong path. VWB- Chapter 3 deals with the integrating into the 1hr and 4hr models. the chart that I posted above shows a snippet of a 4hr model which MAY CONFIRM an impending move Meeee Tooooo! Or anything else for that matter! Can't wait! HJ

--- 帖子 #169 ---
HeavyJ, I think the answer to your question asked on post #168 can be found in the document from Vegas, Step 4, Strategy: 3) After initiating a new position, and stops are in place, we look to take 50% of position off at/or around the tunnel. In other words, we book half the position for a profit. Stop on the other 50% of position is raised to an appropriate profit level or breakeven. 4) The last 50% of position is held until we get opposite signal on the other side of the tunnel [first part of step 3].

--- 帖子 #170 ---
About zooming down to shorter time frames, that's what I understood from Vegas document: With the 4 hour tunnel method, I am inclined to use ‘The Vegas Currency Daily’ black dots as guideposts for determining whether to be long or short from the signals. Because I am still learning English, I am not sure if I understood well what Vegas want to say, I mean if he use signals from daily chart to enter on 4H charts or he use signals from 4H chart to enter on daily charts. Maybe he will be so kind to comment about this. I used the last variant and it worked very well for me. Regarding the current situation with eur/jpy (and maybe gbp/jpy), as long as we are using different approaches but the conclusion seems to be the same, maybe we are really close to catch a new move.

I find myself sitting here feeling like a vouyer watching good people helping each other. I started trading in Sept 05 and managed to niavley lose $8k in real money. I have since then become addicted to learning how to trade properly. I have researched the net every day, read 6 books on trading, (3 to go and 2 still on order) to try to learn as much as possible. My demo acct lost $12k in 1 month! Since finding your forum 2 weeks ago I have started to understand some of the concepts I have been reading about. The generocity of spirit shown by all in the forum is amazing. The Vegas day system in the last few days has put back over $8k into my demo acct!! Vegas and Dialist, you may not be aware of the power of your generosity or what affect it can have on another individual. You have inspired me to help others in all aspects of life and for that I am also greatful. I hope in time to be able to add constructive insight to this forum and in the mean time I will remain a greatfull vouyer.

Hi Lindsay, and welcom to the forums. I know this next tid bit is a bit out of thread context but it really got my curiosity going. Before i ask my Q, Does anyone know if FijiTrader has a public side to what he has going on in the James16Group private forum? Me thinks that Lindsay would enjoy the read. Anyway, my Q and thought is that any risk management system for a new trader that would "put back over $8k into my demo acct" is a tad bit to "risky". It would be suggested by much more knowledgeable individuals on this forum that trading in your demo account like you would in your live is most beneficial. FijiTrader (who is a wonderfuly-wise-filled-fellow) promotes the use of "micro" accounts. These are accounts where a pip is worth 0.10 USD...yup, you read it right, a whoping 10 cents a pip controling $1k of currency. This way the emotions will warm up to the idea of trading and your wins/losses effecting your "system" of stops/limits, letting profits run and cutting short your losses, etc. I will assume that the $8k into your demo was done on a standard $10 a pip demo? My closing thought: Lindsay, you are on the right track being plugged in here. Keep reading and demoing, don't rush back into live trading until you've got a good demo track record with a system that fits your style, begin trading in micro lots and grow a small $3,000 or $5,000 demo account trading no more than 1 to 2% risk per trade, and if you can search out FijiTrader's (he is a leader in the same private forum that Dial is a leader in) great info on trading psychology you will be well on your way to your dream of becoming a proficient trader. Cheers

Hi there SD, easiest way is to unzip the files (if needed) then find your Meta Trader 4 folder in the Program directory of your PC. Then Open experts folder, then indicators folder. Drag the new indicator you saved on your PC into this open folder and then start up MT4 and the indicator should be listed under "Custom Indicators" in the navigator window. Cheers P.S. there are also many free tutorials on MT4 to help w/Q's...your favorite search site should help.

Got it and thank you!

I don't visit this forum as often as I should and I post even less. It's mostly becuase I'm one who doesn't like to get overloaded with input as my trading style is relatively simple and I feel too much to think about confuses the issue. As far as posting I seem to be somewhat abrasive and stir things up just by my revolutionary nature so I don't like exposing good people to my not so pleasing(and somewhat disturbing) personality. It's just that when I started reading this thread I thought to myself. 'Hey, this guy is using my method, too'. I'm very excited to find someone using a very similiar method as my own. I've been developing this method over the past 3 years with the past 2 really starting to come into focus with regard to entry and exit strategies. I just want to thank you Vegas for compiling this for people and explaining it as well. You are a more patient person than I. I haven't taken the time to read the books you have offered yet as I really resist adding too much info to my headspace but after reading this thread I'm sure the info added won't clutter so much as it could help crystalize many of my ideas that I use anyway. I'm going to add a couple of charts to this post to help illustrate some of my ideas in combination with some of what Vegas has offered and I hope that it is of use to someone...anyone.... This is my method of madness in one line. 'Law of Averages'. Just like Vegas uses the extreme fibs as a first condition so do I with my method. I use a 'range' on the edges that I will either long or short from knowing that extremes eventually give in to the median even if the median has been moved by strong trending action. I also take into account the setup of the SMAs and EMAs(which I show in the second chart) and their relation to this 'range'. I, too, like to use the daily, 4hr and 1hr charts to establish a confluence in extreme fib range setups. With the daily taking the lead signal for direction of position, then the 4hr and 1hr charts for the best positioning of entries so I'm with positive positions more often with my trades while I wait out any possible waffling or muddiness that may transpire over the ensuing days after my entires. http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/926...apclean8ah.jpg The first chart has just Vegas's fibo bands and his tunnel(although I didn't use all of them given by Bemac, only 2 of them) from code that Bemac was kind enough to provide to the forum that I plugged into Vtrader. I also have the slow stoch(5,3,3,S) that I use to help distinguish when a move is possibly 'exhuasted' and could be ripe for entries or exits. You will notice that I marked and numbered each time it made first touch on the horizontal lines(at the 20.00 and 80.00) and shown the day(candle) of first touch. The second, trailing touch(the 'b' arrow on the chart) usually happens the next day and both of those days provide great entry levels. Many times it's a beautiful reversal, picture perfect for us to capitalize upon. Other times it signals the beginning of multi-day stretches that provide many opportunities to enter. A few times it winds up being overrun by the trend and could cause the cautious trader(with tight stops) to stop out on initial entries. Even still those initial touch days provide levels for entires and if stops of the trader allow them to remain(and also with possible additional enties in even better positions for the more aggresive trader) there is always(and rarely you get to say that) opportunity(typically over many days) to close them in profit. There are times when we get the stoch first touch yet the price is not in the fib extreme range. While these don't make good entry points they could provide good points to close off exposure so as not to get profits munched by reversals. What I want to point out is when the fib touch that is basis of the Vegas method and the intial slowstoch touch happen together it's good news. In the time the stoch takes to roll over sometimes it would too late to wait for and have missed the best levels for entry. I like to start opening small entires at first touch(of both leading and trailing stoch lines) and continue to add as price action dictates. Also it's interesting to note the price action as the stoch does roll over and the 'return' touches take place can sometimes be exit point days for retracement against a strong trending market for those who want to secure profits. Or in a muddled market where the price action is hanging out in the extreme fib ranges over many days the 'return' touches many times signal the end of muddle and begin the break back towards the tunnel or as I like to call it the 'core' of the trend channel. These return touches are given much scrutiny by me as well they can really help. http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/795...svtsnap8ri.jpg If you look at the second chart I have here you see a little more of my method of madness as I've added some SMAs and EMAs that I use to help me understand what I like to call 'gravity'. Sometimes the price is being pulled towards a certain point then it goes and runs off on it's merry way afterwards. Why? I don't know why, althoughwe all seem to be aware of a multitude of supports and resistances at any given point of trading so sometimes it's hard to determine which one will have influence. But using EMAs I often get to see where it wants to go if in fact the price action is behaving in a way that I don't understand(muddled, overunning, whips). The 'tunnel' as Vegas likes to call it or 'core' as I do provides a clue as to the 'gravity' of daily trendchannel. The EMAs provide clues to the 'gravity' in a different way. It's a longer term period most definitely but I wouldn't really call them weekly or monthly even if they have some connections to what is going on in weekly and monthly timeframes. You can see times when the price action is muddled or overunning often it's because price attempting to make a touch on one of those EMAs and once it satisfies this need to touch it whether it be a quick strike or a number of days ranging around that EMA it begins the return to the tunnel/core. There are times when there is a quick, clean reversal and often it's because many if not all of the EMAs are to one side of the price or the price is ping ponging between the different EMAs above and below it. I altered the EMAs I displayed from the ones I use normally(50,100,200EMA) because I was hoping to find ones that seem to interact better and the ones I have on the charts are ones that I settled on(69,169,209EMA). But to be honest sometimes I think different ones work better at different times so feel free to experiment with different ones that each trader is more comfortable with and the particular currency pair seems to interact with better. There are SMAs(7,13) that I use as 'hot' range not so much as a signal but I like to use them to find the best positions for my entries according to the daily chart's 'hot' range. You can see how the price action interacts with these SMAs and a particular trader might have a different preference of hot range SMAs, like 6 and 12 or 8 and 14. Just get to know the ones you prefer to use I think most of them can be useful once the trader becomes familiar with how the PA acts with the ones they prefer to use. I really look hard at the way EMAs and SMAs are set up as they do play into the price action and give me clues to possible future price action. On the most recent activity(as of right now) I would like to point to the chart history(the second chart with EMAs) and most specifically the May-June Euro swoon. Most people would be like 'Well the signal's are counter ones to the trend, but I want to be on the big move down.' What I want to point out is how all of the EMAs(and including the tunnel/core) are compressed tightly into a two penny range providing a strong base for the deep move. We have a very similiar setup right now that in my opinion could be preparing for a strong rally towards 1.25 over the next couple weeks and possibly more over the next couple months. So for those who want to be on that ride up they should be keeping a close eye on price action the early part of this week. There could be move southward to 1.20 before it makes the trip to 1.25. This is actually the first time I'm seeing this type scenario happen as it happens realtime with the compressed EMAs providing a possible base for a really big move. I didn't see it unfold last May/June the way I'm seeing it now and didn't have that compression type scenario identified before. So this is really still a learning period for this type of strategy. As you can see the compressed nature of the EMAs doesn't happen very often so it's a rare treat we're going to get to see unfold. The previous time there was that much compression before the May/June time was back during Sept/Oct of 2004 that resulted in a move from the 1.20ish range to up over 1.30 culminating in the all-time high of 1.36. There is also a recent example from Sept of 2005 where the EMA compression was present when the pair moved 6-7 pennies in a month(touch #15 down to touch #17). So the last three times we've had the same type compression we've seen strong trending right then. Shall we see it again? I'm thinking it's a very good possibility we might. I would like to add I very much use candleform to help with the identifying of good points of entry and exit. I cannot proclaim enough how much it benefits the trader to become familiar with candleform as it is a direct representation of price action and allows the trader to examine price action in hindsight whether it be day to day or on shorter timecharts. I hope my long winded post has provided some help to people. There is so very much more info that I could have expanded on and there is really alot of information that can help, but it can often confuse the focus of the trader including myself. I like Vegas's minset of simplicity and have made it the basis of all my strategies since I began studying forex years ago. If people have any comments or question I welcome them as my method is really just a mishmash of things I've learned from others and my own insight that I don't consider as something all that special. I feel we all see the same things at times, it's just that it often gets flooded out by too much input which is why I don't spend alot of time on forums. I prefer to not flood my mind with too much. Thanks again Vegas and everyone else who has given their time and energy to contribute to this thread and forum.

Hi Lindsay, and welcome to the forum. I applaud your desire to learn to trade properly. I have to admit, the $8K into your demo account in a few days set off an alarm. One very important thing for you to learn in your quest to become a good trader is risk control and position sizing. To help you further along in that area, I recommend you read all of the following thread carefully, and be sure to follow the links I have in my posts in that thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ghlight=trader Again, welcome to the factory! Post often and never hesitate to ask questions. Dial

From reading through this thread, I wonder if the methodology is daily, weekly, monthly fib levels with a particular attention to spike high and lows.... But, alas, speculation on my part. I do know floor traders at the CBOT who use a method with this as there basis for s/r levels. It is rare to find interesting posts on forums these days, let alone useful posts. Kudos to you all. xt

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Pipsta, great post and info...and i did not precieve any "disturbing" tendencies or anything too "revolutionary" though it was all worth reading! So in your own studies, were you using FIBO levels and calculating them by hand or similar? From your post i gather that having the Fib levels drawn real time on the chart is a recent addition to your model that has been working for you for some time? ...and what Tunnel MA had you been using during the time prior to placement of the VT code from Bemac? Thanks for any reply, and again, great info in your post. Thom

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi Pipsta, Thanks for sharing your way of trading - very informative! Could you comment on your entry/exit strategy/ies? Do you trade strictly off daily charts or do you make use of other timeframes? Also, if you're seeing the EMA's tightening, what in your analysis indicates that this signals a move to the upside? Price Action (especially on a weekly chart) seems to show downward pressure &amp; the stochs on your daily chart you posted are also poised to move downwards. I gather your take is that these are just short-term signals? BlueMeasure

Hey accrete, I guess I should have said 'rebellious' instead of 'revolutionary', but I'm being on my best behavior right now. I've been using software for my studies not calculating by hand. It's just when a new strategy develops, looking at it unfold is often very different than looking at it in the past tense. Watching a daily candle unfold can be misleading at times. It really makes a huge difference when you've actually watched something happen realtime compared to after the fact. As an example, let's say you got two legs down over two candles wide(is that sorta what people are talking about when they refer to a knife?). Both have healthy wicks/tails on them. At some point during the live candle for the second leg it might have looked like it was going to break short because it was establishing the low and it was looking like a gravestone candle and all the indicators are getting tweaked with short bias. It takes a certain amount of experience to be able to open the position right after the test and fail as you can recognize what's happening because you've seen it so many times. I've seen it also break enough times to know what it looks like when it set up to break. Being able to tell the difference comes from seeing it unfold. You can prepare by back testing and looking over the chart history but I found it hardly replaces the experience of seeing it unfold. I was just coming back to comment that I've been looking at some of the charts with the indicators that Bemac prepared for VTrader that I assume are the ones Vegas gave. Other than the daily chart I really can't make heads or tails of them until I read the 1hr and 4hr book dloads. I'm not sure I like em....I like mine better! Heh...sorta like I can't stand other people's driving when I'm the passenger. I prefer using a fib based on 20ma. I also use a faster 'tunnel/core' (14/20). I also use a faster 'hot' tunnel/core(5,7....yea, real hot) too. I liked the fibs/tunnel that VWB uses on the daily chart, I'm not sure about the rest. I guess it's just preference. That's why I usually tell people to try different combinations until they get ones that start to make sense to them. I guess if your using just one set of MAs for your tunnel with the fibs you can go with something more middle of the road. I use a combo of three EMAs that I refer to as a 'web'...heh...partly because sometimes they can get pretty tangled and the pingponging that goes on between them can be very spastic yet quite lucrative once you learn the mannerisms. The strategies most people use usually are pretty much based on the same basic principals, often it's just a matter of finding the right combination of indicators that give you the info you need to be able to recognize what's going on. One of these days I'll load a new chart with VWB indicators and read his material so I can understand it more. It really seems like he uses very similiar variables as I do when determining 'bias'. What I described in my previous post is how I determine daily 'bias'. With CMS you can hedge so much of my style uses layering of positions so it's difficult to describe. Much of it has become intuitive when I look at the 1hr and 4hr charts and see how all of the EMAs and SMAs are arranged. Then look at how the price action is ranging, find the candleform that gives me the right time. As long as I feel confident to open a position with a target in sight and my risk managed I'm good to go! It's not easy to say, this is my system, and lay it out. I usually don't try to figure out which way the market is going to go. I let the market dictate to me which way it wants to go, I just know the way it's going to get there. I capitalize on price action mannerisms, not trend prognostication, although I regularly get caught up in the trend if I play my cards right.

Anyone else watching or even RIDING this EURJPY ? Any comments or observations on that candle structure on the 1 day? It pinged nicely off the 2nd fibo and appears to have gotten stuck on the first one. Think I should just stick with it? It sure does look like it could go either way at this point. Then again, with the USD/JPY gaining, doesn't that contribute to the EUR/JPY dropping? Does anyone else watch other currencies to judge a trade on a separate currency or do you just keep them all seperate in your mind cuz they could technically do anything?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi Stop_Loss, I do watch other pairs but not as the definitive 'Tell All'. I watch them to help me decide if it is STRENGTH in one half of the Pair OR WEAKNESS in the other. eg. I might refrainfrom going long the EUR/USD if... The EUR/JPY is Falling AND The USD/JPY is Gaining This is just one example of all the possable permutations. It just means I have to be convinced by EUR/USD TA that it is time to Buy.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
This EMA squeeze is something relatively new for me. I'm still learning about it. I have to agree that if you look at some of the indicators like slowstoch you might get the impression that if there was going to be a lengthy(weeks long) trend it would be heading south for the eur/usd. Although I'm just going by the way the EMAs are arranged and their 'bias' to give me clues as to what the move may be and which way in this instance. They are telling me something different than what the stoch is saying and I know that the stoch isn't always the most reliable for what I'm trying to use it for in this instance. It's not fully overbought yet as it's still below 80.00 on the daily stoch so the fact that it's rolled over with a sligh bear bias could only be as result of the recent move down that could possibly only be a retrace in preparation of another move long. Which would then turn the stoch back up and give it a nice roller coaster ride looking bias going long before it eventually exhausts itself somewhere up near 1.25. It's something new for me so I'm not sure what to make of it yet. It's about as close as I come to trend guesstimation as I usually come. I'm not sure if I like it much. Sure it's all fancy shmancy could make me look smart stuff if I am right but I kinda prefer the blue collar swing trading. I can be wrong and still profit when I play my 'law of averages' game. It's more about leveraging multiple positions in an extreme range scenario. I have no sentimentality about being 'right' or having to be able to know which way it's going just positioned to take advantage of the waves in movement......if that makes any sense..... It could be that the EMA squeeze results in a huge whipsaw for all I know. It's really still in theory stages. I have some theories about it the theory though. This chart attached(weekly) shows some long term trendlines I looking at and their possible influence. Plus it illustrates by the arrows showing overbought conditions and the corresponding price level that when the stoch goes overbought it doesn't mean it's always done going long with the weekly chart at least. It sure can push on quite a while while still being overbought on the weekly chart apparently. Plus if it makes any difference the pair is oversold on the monthly stoch. The slowstoch as most people know isn't an indicator you want to be totally relying on it solely. Used in connection with others it can be effective. This new theory has alot I'm still puzzled by. I'm not even sure if it eventually will turn up anything useful. edit: I put the wrong chart on...let me get the right one edit again: ok...got the right one...heh

Now this sucker has a 10 pip spread, and at first that wigged me out until I saw how fast it moves around. So I traded it a few times and liked it. Vegas, is there any chance we can get an MT4 plugin for this currency pair?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I appreciate and taken on board your advice. To this point I have not treated my demo account as real money, just tested stratergies. I can see the benefit of setting up the demo acct' as per my real financial position and will trade accordingly. One observation to date with EMA's, Ive noted the 65 EMA seems to be an excellent S/R in most currencies. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Was wondering if anybody is watching e/j? Looks like a shooting star formed on Friday. I know heavy J mentioned it.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Yes, I've been keeping an eye on EURJPY over the last few hours. I interpreted the daily PA and Vegas' system both indicating a potential downtrend when the Asia session opened, but because the weekly chart is bullish decided to wait it out for confirmation. Price has been moving up throughout the day pretty much nixing the bearish potential as it stands right now.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi, would it be a good idea to start a new thread so pple can post when trend reversal signals occur for the vegas daily system

--- 帖子 #191 ---
My system is in a sell postition. We'll see how it goes. Life 30 minutes at time can take some time to develope. I'll post screen shots if it happens.... I will change back to a long position if it breaks and holds above current resistance.

I'm Looking for a 4HR entry hook- with confirmation for short Will sit out longs for the now because risk model is bouncing off extremes. Good Luck Pip hunter! HJ

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Thanks Heavy. My detrend Osc will/should keep me out of any un-necessary whip-saw fake sells. only draw is it misses the ideal entry, but I'll take 75% of a good move any day. I'll post when it develops.....

--- 帖子 #194 ---
After reading the material for the 1hr and 4 hr tunnel method I can see how they are really different from the daily strategy using the extreme fib. Those shorter timeframed strategies are unlike any that I use now. I would have to spend time watching the charts with those indicators in place before I could make a decision on whether I like them or not. I first thought the reading material was more than it turned out to be. It didn't take very long to read it all. I like to complete reading material shortly after I start so I can absorb it all contextually. I set aside a few hours to read it and finished it in less than an hour. Very good. I like short, simple stuff. I'm use to seeing long drawn out superflous text to read when it comes to forex strategy or teaching material. Kudos to Vegas for keeping it brief and to the point for us attention challenged kids!

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Jonny, It would be a great idea if we open a new thread to discuss only the trades of VWB/4H/1H systems. We could share our daily trade entries with charts which will make us to understand the systems more. This way, we might not clutter this thread which can be dedicated for discussions about the systems and enhancements. Just my 2 cents.. Shan

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I agree with both of you. But it should also be kept separate from Vegas suggestions So... I give you the new topic named... Tunnel Vision. Independent Signals &amp; Positioning Recommendations.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Very good Bemac.. Nice that we have 2 threads devoted for Vegas systems. Shan

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hey everyone, I'm pretty new to FX but really interested in learning more. I have metatrader from northfinance and can load the VWB daily but having trouble overlaying the additional risk models. It seems like I can only load one, when I goto load it for the second time to get the additional fib lines it doesn't appear to be working. Any ideas? Thanks for your help. Great thread! Cheers

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Howdy Jim. Try this! If you are applying risk model 1 &amp; 2. set your first indicator to 2 then MT4 should alow you to put on the second indicator which is risk model 1 by default. For some reason MT4 doesn't like to put on 2 indicators with the same risk model. This thing works like a clock tho...once your plugged in! Hope that helps HJ

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Thanks for the help. I'm sorry this is a really dumb question most likely but how do I select the different risk models? I think this is the problem. Cheers

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hello First I want to say thx to all the people who post in tis thread. I´ve learned from all of them I´m a rookie trader and I have a doubt with the VWB model. For example EUR/JPY the level for reverse is 233 or higher. Does it means the candle has to close above or below this level or the price just has to touch 233 line to be in line with the rule?? TIA

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi Jim, When you drag your indicator on to the screen a dialogue box should open up. Seletc the "Inputs" tab-- You should see the Line that says RiskModel with a #1 in the Box Double click on the "1" and change to values 1 thru 4 Then enter. This oughta work. HJ

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Tragapips, Once eur/jpy gets to this area it's time to sit up and take notice. You are looking for a reversal day of the type I point out in VWB. This signals exhaustion and is ripe for trade. Just because the market hits the fib level does not mean you initiate a position.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
S-L, Yes, just use the 'Vegas Currency Daily' and use model #2 AND model #3 overlayed on top. Area of interest is when this market get to the 3rd line [233] or higher.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Thanks so much!! But now I have 9 currency pairs. Crap! That doesn't line up very well on my monitor. I need an even number How about the risk models for the ruble/peso pair ?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Would you settle for the "Monopoly Money/Pieces of Eight" pair instead? :

--- 帖子 #207 ---
http://www.accrete.com/fx_posts/6mon.PNG And with the Rub/Pez pair to round things off you'll have just two charts per monitor and you will still have one monitor free for I.E. to explore the Forums. . . but you might have to rearange the furniature. Oh, and the fine print on the ad should include "Marty Feldman Eyes" are helpful.

Exactly. We have a really great thing going here and I would like to keep it going. I am really glad you "cleaned up" this thread. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
On occasion I am getting an alert on MT4....the bell sound and I can not figure out why. I have checked the journal but it does not list anything. The only thing I can think that may be triggering it is the VWB fibs or MA's moving???? Just my best guess so far. Does anybody else get these alerts or have I been watching the screen too much and getting some kind of brain overload??

--- 帖子 #212 ---
First, thank you all for the patience and willingness to work with newcomers to trading and VWB. Are we now on alert regarding the USD/JPY and looking for the reversal Day? How does the pending Non-Farm payroll announcement fit in to entry decsions? _______ 1235813 Bliss

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Yes, we should be on alert regarding USD/JPY and EUR/JPY looking for the reversal. As far as the NPF I am going to defer that to someone with more knowledge than myself. Shootist

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Greetings from Melbourne, Australia. EURJPY looks like it's reached stage-1 of reversal (Vegas D1 strategy). Maybe monday will show us more! (see attached chart) I have a question for Vegas re GBPUSD (D1 chart): 1. 23-Jan ... cable broke FIB extreme 2. 24-Jan ... cable closed down Did you go short sometime late on 24th? If not, why not ?? Also, "thanks" goes not really convey my gratitude to you Vegas and to all other contributors to this particular thread. I recognise the foundations of a solid system in what is being discussed here. I only wish I could contribute to the common knowledgebase. Ron B

From Post #105 By Vegas Jan 25 '06 http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showpost.php?p=39885&amp;postcount=105 As I write this, gbp/usd has put in a reversal day at the outer fib number. The market has been very bullish lately, with "experts" all over the place predicting future price action. All I know is that I got my signal and I'm short [like I described in a past post] with stop above the reversal high. Will I be right? I don't care, because I did what I am supposed to do. I am simply picking marbles out of a bag.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi Thanks for your response Bemac. I had previously read post-105 and noted that Vegas wrote it on Jan-26 (which was a down day too). I would just like to know why he did not go short GBPUSD on Jan-24 (2 days earlier). Based on vwb.doc, I would have figured that the down bar on Jan-24 signaled a reversal (50% retracement). I read all this thread postings very carefully and being a fx noob, I took the writings of Vegas quite literally. My knowledge of vwb would be enhanced by knowing why Vegas passed on the Jan-24 short signal, if indeed that is what he did. I hope I haven't offended anyone. Sorry to waste your time, Vegas. r.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
rjb1024, Just because the market was down that day doesn't mean it gives a signal to sell. There simply was no sign of exhaustion that day that manifested itself into a sell signal [candle formations]. As to the 50% retracement, what happened on the 24th has no bearing on a signal unless it would have taken out the low of the previous day [the 23rd, which it didn't]. If it had, it would have been a classic outside reversal day which would have triggered a sell signal. The 50% retracement is only a day rule and does not carryover to the next day. Once you have recognized a potential reversal day in progress, then you can use this 50% retracement rule. Although the 24th did produce a new high, the price action was not characterized by anything resembling panic buying that is normally seen at tops. That came the next day when buying that powered us up to the 1.7930 area was quickly met with selling that took it below 1.79. I'll have more on recognizing this in VWB Part II.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Vegas, Please correct me if I'm wrong.{again} But in an effort to make sure EVERYONE understands you, I would like to offer this definition. panic buying: {in the mind of Bemac only} Epitimises the event that occurs when Holders of SHORT contracts run for the Fire Exits because they suspect there is much greater UPSIDE potential forthcoming. Comments {particularly from de man} on whether this offers a short scalp opportunity from the stall level would be welcome.[ie. the red dot of the bullseye for De Bears]

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Bemac, I would add a couple of things to your definition. Add to the list everybody who has been waiting for the break to buy and it hasn't materialized. They throw in the towel and buy at any price. Also add to the list all those spec scalpers who see easy money on the long side. In the final analysis, there is nobody left to take it higher. Yes, there is a scalp opportunity. I get into this in VWB Part II.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
First of all thank you very much Vegas - this is my first post in this forum. Now - I have a very simple question - There is something i don't understand/ I downloaded files of the mq4 - I put it in the experts in mt4. I compiled it - tells me there are no errors but when i click on the ea twice it doesn't open - what seems to be the problem? Is there anything I do wrong? Can someone help me do it correctly? my messenger is: ftaton@mail.com I will be happy to get some help -THX p/s - i am new to all this.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
united, Put the plugin in the metatrader/experts/indicators directory. Open metatrader and get a chart up and then go up-top to Insert&gt;indicators&gt;custom and you should see the plugin near the bottom. Click on and the box pops up. Choose model # from Inputs section, colors and type of lines from the colors Section. Hit OK twice and everything should appear on the chart.

You are aware, dear sir, that bumping is considered bad netiquette? You should make it (look like) a useful post, like mine... : (Sorry, couldn't resist!)

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I get several requests per week from new subscribers who are unfamiliar with how to navigate around Forex Factory who ask me for help in locating the Vegas' documents. I had six requests yesterday alone. I emailed them all and told them I would bump the thread containing the docs to the top where they could find them easily. I did this rather than making the entire thread a sticky. However, I have now made a sticky containing links to all the Vegas docs. I leave it to Merlin to remove it if he thinks it inappropriate as I respect his wise opinion. I've also locked the sticky so no one can hijack it.

Hello guys , I'm a newbie with a newbie question regarding vegas 1 hr. If the cross of the tunnel is missed, eg Cable crossed the tunnel on the 3rd of Febuary and has been down since. 1.Is it always best to wait for another signal of price and 12ema crossing back above the tunnel? 2.Or wait until price approaches the tunnel and if it reverses and starts to trade below 12ema, to initiate to short position.Would this be valid or will I be shorting an oversold market? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi there. This is my first post on this forum. I am not going to repeat it and tell Vegas how grateful I am. Instead, just in case anyone needs it, here's a tweaked version of Vegas_currency_daily indicator. Daily_MAs parameter turns on\off the ability to plot MA's taken from the daily chart on any lower time frame. I use it for spotting reversals. I am planning to start trading with VWB very soon. And I have a question, does anyone have statistics of this system's performance. I would like to know the maximum amount of draw down in points in order to calculate the size of initial deposit (assuming I will be trading in micro-lots (0.01)).

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Very cool. Great to be able to see the daily fib levels on H1 or H4 charts. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Sorry, I don't have the stats you want, but can you explain how you use your adapted indicator to spot reversals -- presumably earlier than on the daily -- but how reliable is this? Thanks Trinity

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Norbecker, I'm glad you liked it. Trinity, This indicator simply lets you look at a more detailed picture of what's going on inside the daily bar, without having to plot\remember the levels from a daily chart. Vegas wrote: The 50% retracement is only a day rule and does not carryover to the next day. Once you have recognized a potential reversal day in progress, then you can use this 50% retracement rule. I don't actually get how Vegas spots potential reversal days (maybe I should re-read the thread and the docs). My methods of spotting reversals are not as effective as I would want them to be (they are definitely too complicated), so I guess you don't want to know how I do it. Instead, let's try to understand Vegas's 50% retracement method.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Vegas, Back last December, you had replied to an email I sent where you described the use of the VWB indicators on weekly charts as well. You had suggested risk model #4 on the cable. since there was no mention of this in the VWB docs, have you abandoned this consideration? Thanx for your help HeavyJ

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I have been reading the 4 Hr Tunnel Methods info &amp; would like to ask anyone that is using this method if a daily chart with 24 &amp; 28 ema's is needed, or just the 4hr &amp; the weekly with the required ma's. I have noticed that some are posting charts showing the 24 &amp; 28 ma's that is why i'm asking. Also what advice can someone that is using this method give in regards to the usage of this method? How well does this method perform if followed correctly. Thanks for any advice &amp; help in learning this method.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
For the original 4H tunnel you would use the weekly chart for the trend direction. Since the release of the VWB and the daily chart with fib levels. Some people have used that for trend direction. The weekly does not react to changes in trend as quickly as the daily. You will have a higher probability of a profitable trade in the 4H tunnel when you use the VWB daily (at the outer fib levels with a reversal pattern) for trend direction. I hope that is what you were looking for.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Norbecker, Thats exactly what i was looking for. Now i have a clearer picture of what is needed. I am a new member to the forum just trying to put together the 4 Hr method &amp; you have been a big help. Thanks &amp; have a good day.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I know this forum primarily deals with forex trades but I noticed that the VWB document referenced a set up for the S&amp;P mini, too. I have Metatrader and eSignal. Can anyone tell me how to get the S&amp;P data feed into Metatrader to experiement with the VWB strategies as it pertains to the S&amp;P Mini. Thanks

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Nevermind my previous post.... I just found and downloaded the VWB II document and see that there is information pertinent to my question there. Thanks anyway...

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi dberti. The S&amp;P data feed are only available if you downloaded MT4 from this site: http://www.strategybuilderfx.com Just to be safe, uninstall the MT4 first from your PC if it's already installed. You can then download the data feeds from the menu: Tools -&gt; History Center -&gt; Indexes Hope this helps. P.S. Okay, please disregard this post too since you found it.

only seems to show up with certain demos.ie,interbank has it and when you click on new chart it shows up under indexes.

Loaded MetaTrader4 from Strategy Builder. Opened VegasCurrencyDaily file and loaded in MetaTrader4 Editor. However, after using expert advisor wizard and conpiling then went to Client Terminal and followed insert, indicators, and custom. Open VegasCurrencyDaily but doesn't work. No option can be seen for models 1, 2, 3, or 4. Are there step by step directions to set this up? Really want to get started. Thanks for your patience and any guidance that can be provided. Ktdaniel

--- 帖子 #253 ---
You don't want to double-click the VegasCurrencyDaily file. That opens the editor. You just need to copy that file to the appropriate folder. Go to the directory where you installed MT4. Within the folder should be a "experts" folder. Then there should be a "indicators" folder. Put the VegasCurrencyDaily file in the "indicators" folder. If you had MT4 open while doing this you will need to restart it. Then the indicator should be available in the "Custom Indicators" category in the Navigator. Just drag it to the chart you want to apply it to or you can right click the indicator and select "Attach to a chart". You can adjust the risk model on the "Inputs" tab of the window that pops up before applying the indicator to the chart.

hi everyone and vegas, I am new to this forum but i noticed that the amount of posts here are enormous and very good for learning. I would love to add a new trick to my bag of indicators and see if i could make some pips regularly. I just received the VWB file from vegas 2days ago and will spend sometime studying it. Does anyone have any tips on how to approach it? Of course i will put alot of hours into it and see if it can do magic for me too since i have read that many people in this forum as well as others have used the Vegas tunnel. once i can apply it properly i will definitely email him to say thanks personally. Cheers

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi Vegas, First, thank you for posting the details of your strategy Second, a few small details I'd like cleared up Your instructions say to use 24 EMA and 28 EMA. The fib levels are calculated from the 28 EMA, but I haven't been able to find any purpose to the 24 EMA Is it used for something? EUR/USD uses model 1 and 2. Interest when it reaches 233 or higher. Model 2 is 144, 233 and 377. I didn't read (might have missed it) if there was any use for the intermediate lines of 89 from Model 1 or 144. Could you explain if there is any use for the intermediate lines that are plotted? If the 89 is not used then would EUR/USD just be model 2? I just wanted to make sure we weren't missing any of the finer points Many thanks Alan

I'd like to know how many signals a day or week can be generated by the VEGA model? It seems that the longer EMA are making fewer signals!!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I believe in the VWB II thread Vegas said that in the last 24 months there were 220 signals. I don't recall all the currency pairs he used to come up with that number.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Alan, I asked about the 24 EMA in post #2 of this thread, and Vegas gave an outstanding answer in post #12. Dial

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Dial Thanks. I just started to copy and paste Vegas's latest posts into a document but hadn't got round to starting from the beginning Best regards Alan

--- 帖子 #261 ---
can someone out there help me in attach the VEGAS models to my price Charts on meta trader 4 station . I going crazy trying to set up for the London session tmmorrow . Is there a manual way of doing it not that proficent in scripts .

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Windows Explorer C: Program Files Meta Trader 4 Experts Indicator Past Vegas Currency Daily in Indicator folder Make sure you close MT4 and reopen if it was open when you did this. The indicator will be listed with others in the custom Indicator folder in the Navagator in MT4. Let me know if this doesnt make sense.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Nutmg12 thanks for your reply , cant make sense of it. trying what you said , the file that I copied on my desk top cant paste onto the charts ... Lost and dont know what to do. Help!!!!!!!!!!!!

Try here: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=4497 Hi Dial, maybe you could also include the above link together with the post having the vegas' files for easier reference..

--- 帖子 #265 ---
tried it your way noting seems to work. STRESSED OUT!!! all morning trying to get this . Question arent the model lines Moving Avg that i can manually Plot. anything would help right now. At the point were I am going to throw my sreen out the window!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Just take it slow man.. Calm down and take a breather.. No ones after you... The market will still be there.. The moving averages, you can manually insert in your chart.. Try this link: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=4486 However, for the fib levels, you need the indicator..

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Maybe this is what is causing the problem: First, I am assuming your computer has a version of Windows installed on it like Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows 98, etc. There are two possible locations where your MetaTrader 4 program is installed. Here are instructions for both locations. Make sure MT4 is not open. If it is then close it. Open Windows Explorer by double-clicking the My Computer icon. Double-Click on (C) Note: It may say something like Local disk (C) (I had to remove the colon after the C because it puts a smiley in its place.) Look down the list of yellow folders until you see a folder named Program Files Double-click it. Look down the list of yellow folders until you see a folder named MetaTrader 4 or StrategyBuilderFX 4 (depending on which version you installed). Double-click it. Look down the list of yellow folders until you see a folder named Experts Double-click it. Look down the list of yellow folders until you see a folder named Indicators Double-click it. This is where you put the two files provided to us by Vegas. These files are named Vegas Currency Daily.mq4 and Vegas S_P Daily.mq4 Once you have the two files in this location open MT4. Look at the very top of the MT4 program for where the pull down menus File View Insert Charts Tools Vindow Help are. Click on View Click on Navigator The Navigator window appears in the left side of your screen. Double-click on Custom Indicators Look for the Vegas Currency Daily indicator and drag it onto the chart you want to apply it to. Make shre this is a Daily chart. You should see the fib and tunnel lines appear on the chart. Move your mouse to an area of the chart where there are no candles or lines and right-click it. A menu appears. Select Indicators List (the third item on the list). Click on Vegas Currency Daily and select Edit Click on the Inputs tab Second from the top is a field called RiskModel Its default value is 1. This is the value you change and can be from 1 to 4 depending on the currency pair chart you are working with. Some of the charts require two sets of fib lines. Simply repeat the process of adding the Vegas Currency Daily as you originally did to the chart by dragging it from the Navigator window. Hope this helps.

After applying the set model to your chart, double click on the model number in the box, and substitute the new model number. Then apply that to the chart as well. Trinity

Anybody else watching the GBPUSD for a revesal aftre the 3rd fib touch on Friday?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
There could well be more downside before a stall and reversal.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
For now, radar is shining on GBP and JPY

--- 帖子 #276 ---
USD CAD anybody???

--- 帖子 #277 ---
The Pin Bar on the Daily could well signal a reversal, and could be entered at about 1.1573 as a short (at or below the low of the PB). Partial profits could be taken at about 30-40 pips profit and the SL then set at Breakeven.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
That's what I was thinking, entry point at 1.1584 the low og PB. I call it doji... not PB

--- 帖子 #279 ---
It is a doji. It also qualifies as a pin bar which has other constraints (in this case open/close are below the high of the previous bar and they are situated close to one another near the bottom of the pin bar). It's appearing at a swing high at a point of previous resistance. (Not all pins will be dojis and not all dojis will be pins!) Like with a doji, it is important also to look at *where* it has formed. Whether we call this a doji or a pin, it's probably a good place to look at a change in direction It will be interesting to see what happens. Cheers, Linc.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
100% true. It is important the formation, but is important where the formation takes place. I would like to folow this pair. I think it's an interesting moment

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Just what I was thinking short below or at 1.1584 Needs to break out of the range on the hourly and 4 hr to be able to drop further.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
A couple of currencies are at fib extremes with the announcement of the NFP. I realise that price is the leading indicator and that if the 3 entry signals are satisfied as per VWB2 that we should trade no matter what. But if hypotheticaly all three signals were satisified in any of these pairs, I would still feel unsure in these circumstances that it would not just be a correction of the NFP market response. Most fundamental analysis seems to suggest further strengthening of the Dollar. It's pretty hard to just ignore the fundamentals in conjunction with an major economic announcement that makes the market have a knee jerk reaction that might look like an exhaustion move. I wonder if any others agree that in this sort of environment, should the 3 signals for entry occur that they could be caused by a correction of the market initial reaction therefore giving us a probable false entry and that it would be wiser to stay out of a trade for while in these circumstance. Or do we just follow what price demands? Any opinions folks?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hi Lindsay, This is just an my take on the situation, but if you were concerned with the trade potential based on fundamentals, you might decide to take the trade anyway, but 'play the cards close to your chest'. I think that Vegas did this with one of the GBP trades last month. You could take the trade and use tighter stops, shfiting stop loss to break even early on and shifting into a 'free trade' mode. This way if it is only a minor correction you don't loose much (and may even take a profit!) and if it IS a good turning point, you do get into the trade. Cheers, Linc.

Hi folks, Over the last week or so I have [via pm and forum posts] been requested info on VT code for various indicators &amp; sysems I have posted here. Im not sure if you are aware of this other forum but, in the event that you are not, check this one out. http://www.visualtradingcharts.com/...a602464198ae0a4 There you will find not only most of the stuff I have written for VT {including VWB &amp; Tunnel etc} but some really good Indicators and Systems by others. Suggest you do a search for authors Claude to see some pretty amazing stuff Or Bantam for extensive Tunnel system work

--- 帖子 #286 ---
First and foremost very much thanks to Mr. Vegas for his generosity, time and willingness to answer questions. In VWB II, in chapter 3, section 1 the document indicates - "It's very clear from the data that you can make the following conclusions:" - however I have been trying very hard to figure out how the analysis of data in section 2 (I believe this is what is being referred to) can yield the probabilities mentioned in the three bullets following the statement. I am not a math person, so it’s probably something very simple that I don’t get. Can anyone give me some guidance of how I can calculate the type of probabilities mentioned in Chapter 3, section 1 from the median analysis and/or dataset available in Chapter 2? I would be very grateful. I was not sure if it was right to post text right out of the VWB II doc without permission so I kept my extract to a bare minimum just to show where I was having the question. I apologize in advance if this is outside of the forum rules. Thanks for your time, AH.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hahaha.. That makes us two AH.. I really just browsed through the VWB III because it was very difficult for me to understand what was written there.. I'm planning to go back to it when I'm in the condition for deeper reading and understanding.. I like math but I got tired of it when I started calculus, integrals, etc., during college.. Regards, East

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi East, Just want to verify we're talking about the same document. I was referring to VWB II, Chapter 3, section 1. You mentioned VWB III, which I am aware of but have not purchased yet. Thanks again, AH.

Okay, I screwed with the numbers.. I actually was referring to VWB II.. Thanks for the clarification.. Regards, East

Hi Guys, im new to this forum and just found and download VEGAS WEALTH BUILDER PART I and II but i dont really sure how to insert the Vegas Currency Daily and Vegas S_p Daily, I will appreciate if anyone provide me apropriate information... thanks... and wish you all happy trading

--- 帖子 #291 ---
sundra, Have you already downloaded MetaTrader 4? If not, you can find it here: http://www.strategybuilderfx.com Then you'll need to download the Vegas indicators (.mq4 files) and copy them to the "indicators" folder for MT4 (for example, the path may be "C:\Program Files\StrategyBuilderFX 4\experts\indicators"). These indicators may be found in the first message of this thread. Then start MetaTrader, open the charts as specified in VWB and insert the indicators by selecting, for example, Insert|Indicators|Custom|Vegas Currency Daily. Be sure to follow the instructions from VWB for inserting the indicators, because each currency pair has its own settings.

Hi MrPips, thanks for your great advice and now i start studing the graph after ur advice, guys, im in learning phase on Vegas method and will take time to give more reply and feedback from vegas model, so i hope you guys will give me more support on my learning... and my special and sincere thanks to Mr Vegas for his effort thanks and have a profitable trading....

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi guys, Currently im understudy Vegas "Vegas 1 Hour Tunnel Method" and quite confuse on few things, is there anyone can help me to make me more understand about what its about??? ============================================= Example: GBP/USD is trading at 1.8500. The ema's are as follows: 144- 1.8494, 169- 1.8512. The market breaks 1.8494, and you sell at 1.8492. Your stop and reverse is now at 1.8512. Over the following hours, market starts to go down. 40 minutes after you put position on, cable is at 1.8440. You can use for computation purposes either tunnel boundary or the median of the tunnel. Ema's are still the same, so if you use the median, 55 from 1.8503 is 1.8448. You should have taken part of the position off at 1.8448. Market does nothing rest of day. Stop can be moved down to protect position or left alone at tunnel. You are now looking for price to be 89 pips away from the ema's. Since 55 was already passed, it no longer concerns us in this cycle. A couple of days later, cable is at 1.8300 and the median of ema's is 1.8410 [1.8400 - 1.8420]. You should be out of another portion of the position at 1.8321. Market bottoms here and in the next 2 hours, cable screams to 1.8535. Your remaining short position is covered at upper tunnel boundary of 1.8420, and you are now long from this point as well. Since you are long, you would now take partial profits at 1.8475 and 1.8509. ========================================= From my understanding... GBP/USD Trading is: 1.8500 ema 144: 1.8494 ema 169: 1.8512 Sell: 1.8492 in my understanding, when ema 169 is above ema 144 that mean the market is on downtrend,so how i could make a partial profit from this scenario..??? thanks and may have a profitable trading

--- 帖子 #295 ---
sundra, You're selling during a downtrend, so you're going to make money in this scenario. When it's trending upward, you should buy.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
EUR / CAD ? What do you think?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
We had a strong daily BUB, close near the top and no sign of weakness. No rush... It is however on my watch list and I may initiate position near the 1.4100/50 failure.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Good day guys... thanks Mrpips... now i understand what vegas mean.... one more question... in "vegas currency daily" indicator he customise ema 24 and 26, and in "vegas 1 hour tunnel method" he prefer ema 144 and 169 to develop a tunnel, in uptrend market i think ema 24 and 26 tunnel are more closer to the moving graph and it will setup the most highest "stop" which can prevent from losing more pips if sudden downtrend of market... wat u guys think about this? and can anyone explain me the purpose of ema 144-169 compare to ema 24-28 thanks and may have profitable trading

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Please, what do you consider small losses?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
From this I take it you place your trade from the Vegas Currency and then look for your exit on the 4hour tunnel chart?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Euro/Cad......which model are you using? i love this it keeps getting broader! thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #302 ---
an observation and question. GBP/USD has surpassed the 3rd fib level and is headed for the 4th. Definitely time to sit up and take notice. At this point there is no trade because there is no price action on the daily to tell us the market is exhausting itself. Now the question. Do we have to wait for daily price action to show us this, or can we already be moving down to say a 4 hr. chart to look for signs the market might be exhausted? Obviously, a pin bar on the daily tommorrow would be a trade signal to be considered, which leads to another question. Say tommorrow the market heads north again, but during the day comes back down, and forms a pin. If I'm watching during the day and I see the market shoot up, then come back down past 50% of its high for that day, is this the 50% retracement rule vegas is talking about. If it is, then I think I've got the concept of what his 50% retracement rule is, and at that point might start entering partial positions before the pin has completely formed, therby giving me a head start into the trade. If anyone thinks I am close here, please let me know. As always, thanks in advance. Jimmy

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Does anyone have a clue why my chart looks like this. It looks like there are no buy and sell points. Im using vwb model on Vtrader. Im using 1hr chart as described in vwb. Infact all my 1hr charts look like that but when I move to higher time frame is when I can take a look at them and guess whether I need to buy or sell ALSO I tried to use vegas model on MT4 and its been over an hour and the attachement file (vegas currency Daily) is still compiling.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
These are my thoughts exactly, waiting for a clear Reversal candle to be fully formed or a 50% retracement from a high today once the range has bee around 60 pips... Just have to be patient as hard as that is..

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Dude, just my two cents, Don't anticipate where the market is going or what the market will do (although I sometimes do it too but right now I'm not doing it so I think I'm on the right frame of mind.. hehe)... Know your signal, wait for it and let the market do its thing... Well, if you're not anticipating the market, then my humble apologies. Regards, East

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Well said East, never trying to anticipate where the market is going and always letting the market come to us. MM

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Thanks, any two cents are always welcome. If I get enough two cents, and keep putting them in my trading account I'll be in good shape. I didn't think I was trying to anticipate where the market was going, I was trying to anticipate implementing Vegas' entry strategy if the market did show signs of a reversal. But, having read your response, I'm not so sure I wasn't anticipating a little! East, thanks for making me THINK. Jimmy

--- 帖子 #308 ---
lachie, Thanks for your response. I am really wondering if I'm fully understanding Vegas' 50% retracement rule, and from what you said I think I am. Yesterday's price action has no relation to the 50%. The 50% retracement would based on today's price action once the market has had at least a 60 pip range. Or that scenario might not happen at all today, and we need to wait until tomorrow, or the next day, or the next, etc. Jimmy

--- 帖子 #309 ---
That's my understanding after rereading it a few times.. I'm in now, 2 textbook Vegas setups overnight. sold EURUSD 12352.5 Bought USDCHF 12695.5 Watching AUDUSD, GBPUSD and EURJPY for solid reversal signs..

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Attached is an Excel spreadsheet as outlined in Vegas Weath Builder II All you have to enter is the daily open, high, &amp; low and it will calculate the rest automatically. I don't have sundays in the spreadsheet as I don't trade on weekends, but you can delete the date, open, high, &amp; low information and put in whatever days and currancy pair information you want, it will still calculate the same. Let me know if you think I need to change anything.

I had same problem after I downloaded new version of VT. I found out what you need to do is click on the 6th icon down in the first column in the rt. hand section of the VT navigator window labeled "symbols". Then a window opens up - click on the arrow symbol.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I do. I wrote it. The Indicator you have on your 1Hr Chart is designed to be applied to a Daily Chart Only. You may want to check this one out instead. It is designed to show Daily Tunnel Indicator on Timeframes down to 30 min. ***Note*** You will have to set your Bars On Chart "History" to a minimun of 2000 bars. http://www.visualtradingcharts.com/f...hp?p=9141#9141 I would suggest you may want to read the thread also for more insight into the indicator.

Can someone help me out here. I have been going over this Daily VWB and it seems good until I hit a few long/strong trends. Check out the attached pic. I see so many trend reversals. Am I doing something wrong here? Everything in this chart tells me to short, but obviously I would have lost. BTW I'm very new to FOREX.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
During a strong trend when the price is riding the outermost fib lines, what might appear to be a reversal can sometimes be a headfake and leave you watching the price continue in its original direction. According to Vegas' rules, if you have 2 losing trades at the outer fibos (assuming you have based your trades on the potential of the reversal, i.e. speed, daily hi/lo, 50% retracement) then it verifies that the trend is too strong to use the VWB on and you should let the price return to the tunnel before considering any VWB trade action. Repeated attempts at catching a reversal in a situation like this will not be friendly to your trading acct. Remember Vegas' roulette story? If you use good money management, then the 2 losses you incur should be miniscule in comparison to a winning VWB trade when it does happen. I'm still learning also, but I think I've explained this correctly. Maybe someone else can chime in and correct me if I've mis-stated any aspect of this.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hello, Is it possible to adapt the Vegas 4 Hour Tunnel strategy for Oanda ? Because Oanda doesn't have 4 hour time frame, but only 3 hour time frame. Did any of you try this ? Any results ? Thanks !

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Oanda does not have the capability to create the fib lines etc that the Vegas indicator calls for. What I did was open a demo MT4 acct and use it for charting and use Oanda to place the trades. I use the StrategybuilderFx ver of mt4 as it does not expire.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
During strong trends, I'd be very cautious to trade the VWB model. In my opinion, it works best in ranging or mildly trending markets, but in heavily trending markets it's risky because pullbacks off extreme fib lines seldom reach the tunnel before contueing stubbornly onto new highs.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
This is spot on. The key is to move SL to BE as soon as possible. This still may not be possible is some situations, but it will decrease amount of losing trades. Andrew.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I've tried this, but for some reason can't insert the indicator twice. When I pull up the indicator list, I only see it listed once. Has anyone had this problem? Also, how do you set the Vegas Daily Currency indicator to "model 1" or model 2"? I don't see this anywhere on the indicator. (This may be why I'm having trouble with the first question. Thanks for your help! Beth

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Sorry, bad instructions. You have to insert the first one, set the risk model, then insert the second one and set the risk model. If you try to insert two with the same risk model, the second one is ignored and doesn'nt show up on the list. Here, try it this way: Click Insert&gt;Indicators&gt;Custom then choose Vegas Currency Daily from the list that appears. When you click on it, a dialog box with four tabs at the top should appear. Click the Inputs tab an you will then see a line labeled RiskModel with a default value of 1. If it is not 1, then make it so. Click OK. Now do it all again, only this time change the RiskModel to 2 before clicking OK. You should now have two copies of the indicator overlaid on your chart. Dial

First post here. Just curious how many having been using this system (demo or real) and what kind of results they are getting? At the moment it doesn't look as though there is any currency approaching a fib line. So presumably I may take me several days to be able to see some signals that would indicate a trade.

In the second thread (that is a sticky) of the Beginners Forum, you will find all the indicators and instructions for all Vegas methods. http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=4365 Thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #330 ---
The market of late has not been very conducive to the Vegas method. However I have broken even on most trades using these methods and made slight profits. In the past these methods have done very well. But, as is the way with all markets there is not just one method that will work in all conditions without adaptation. Thanks Scott

This simple rule is the key. Capital preservation.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I found an Epert Advisor for the Vegas Method. I was not able to get it to work in SBFX platform. I do not know anything about coding so I was not able to use it. The author of the EA name is Chris Battles and when I sent an email to him it bounced back not able to deliver. I have been look for him on these forums or another EA for Wealth Builder.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I've always thought that it's kind of silly for indicators and experts to be separate, since they're usually used the same way. It should be easier to convert MT4 indicators into experts and vice versa. Ideally there would be no difference, or there would be such a thing as an expert/indicator. I have problems with the programming language and interface. Indicators are written by filling buffers with data in order to show stuff on the screen. Experts are written by generating orders. So far there's no way to use an indicator to generate an order, as far as I can tell.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Use MT4 for charting until it stops producing a feed and your broker keeps its feed going, such as weekends and holidays.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thanks for your help, Dial. Worked superbly. One things that I might add to your instructions is that when you want to change the RiskModel, you have to double click on the line. It took me a minute to figure that out. Hopefully, that will help anyone else, too, who hasn't used MetaTrader4 before. Incidentally, my inability to get this thing to work forced me to figure out how to get my own charting software to do this. So for anyone who uses Genesis Financial, I've got the custom indicator worked out. It isn't as easy as using one indicator, unfortunately, but it works quite well once you have it set up. Beth

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Beth, is there a difference between Genesis Navigator and Financial? I've seen Brain Talbot describe how he uses Navigator with VantagePoint software. Trinity

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I just started reading the VWB and its once again a very very informative piece of work. I just love how Vega recaps his first days as a trader. That was very brave of him to try trading in the pit. Just wondering about one thing since the early parts of the VWB document stated that this daily method would be for people who can't keep a constant lookout on the market. So did that mean the 1hr and 4 hr are only meant for full-time traders that can afford to stalk the price movement by the minute?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Anybody, This morning i saw someone speaking of making just 10 pips per day but forgot who and where the forum was, they were speaking about a guy named Rob that has mentored this system, can anyone inform me of his name and in which forum this was located. Great thanks. Howard

i have a question concerning the vegas strategy, if i want to analyse eur/usd then i have to take 2indicators, right? Once with riskmodule:1 and once with riskmodule:2 Ok, furthermore the vegas document says that i am only allowed when i reached the third fibo level. My question is where can i see that fibo level? When do i reach it, where can i see that? Here's an example: http://img111.imageshack.us/img111/8...tled6ix.th.jpg is the fibo lvl 3 = F+ 3? If it is so, i have to wait very long till i reach 1.2962, havent i? I am looking forward to a short anwser. Greets mike

Hi Howard I think the info you are looking for is the one on Rob Booker, this is what he teaches people to do. His website is www.robbooker.com . I do not know anyhting about this stratergy it is to short a time frame for me. Hope this is the info you were after. Jon

Sorry to take so long to respond, Trinity. Work has been busy. Genesis Financial makes a charting software called "Trade Navigator." There are different levels that you can buy (Silver, Gold, Platinum). I've been using Gold for almost 7 years. I get the daily and intraday time-delayed quotes and chart info from Gensis for about $65 per day. This includes futures, stocks and indices (currencies are considered an index). I'm pretty straightforward in everything I do, including my trading. I like it simple and easy-to-understand because I've got too many technical things that I have to keep up with in my business. Trade Navigator software is simpler to use than others. (I even have my housewife friends using it!) I'm not saying its the best or most versatile, but I like it. I can easily figure out how to code special indicators, and I'm definitely not a software code writer. I have heavy experience in Excel, which I found helps with the special indicators in Trade Navigator. By the way, I have used VantagePoint Software with Trade Navigator, too. I found that VantagePoint isn't that much better than other things out there that are less expensive to purchase. I eventually stopped using it because it didn't help me that much. Hope this helps! http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ons/icon10.gif Beth

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Beth, do you mean $65 per month???

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Jon, I got on this website and looked at the free info. There is a good little ebook on it called "Strategy: 10." Here's the link: www.robbooker.com/Strategy10.pdf . I would really recommend this ebook for beginning traders. In this ebook, Booker talks about making 10 pips per day his GOAL. This is actually very easy, especially with the info that Vegas gave us in the second part of the Vegas Wealth Builder document. I like Booker's approach because I actually set my daily goals very low also -- 20-30 pips. I look at it this way. If you're trading a .05% margin in a mini account ($50 controls $10,000), 20-30 pips is $20-30. $20 profit / $50 investment is a 40% return on your investment (remember that I'm a financial person). $30 profit / $50 investment is a 60% return. WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD CAN YOU GET A CONSISTENT RETURN LIKE THIS???? The most heavily traded currency markets (EUR-USD and GBP-USD) easily move 20-30 pips a day. If you study what Vegas wrote in that second document, you have enough info to figure out how to get this very small amount out of the market, almost on daily basis. Again, I'm a financial person and I tend to look at how to trade in the simplest way possible. Our goal is not BIG money. Our goal is to have consistent cashflow over a long period of time. If you have consistent cashflow, you really don't need to stockpile money--unless you just want it as a security blanket. (For you beginners, a good book on this concept is "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki.) A consistent 40-60% DAILY (or even WEEKLY) return is a great return http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...cons/icon4.gif (Even 10 pips per day, which would be a 20% return is terrific. If you don't think so, look at the S&amp;P500 annual return over the past YEAR.) Just my thoughts on the subject! Thanks for passing this information along, Jon. Beth

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Oops! Big goof!!! http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...cons/icon9.gif Yes, $65 per month. You can get the daily stuff (without the intraday) for $40. Beth

--- 帖子 #351 ---
but on the same token, if you lose 20-30 pips, won't you be losing 40-60%?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Absolutely. That's why I look at the % return of a trade (winning and losing), not just the dollar amount. That's also why I set up the trade first and don't trade emotionally. If it doesn't look like a good day, I just turn it off and forget about it. Beth

--- 帖子 #353 ---
i have a question for all using the VWB he trades currency futures and emini s&amp;p500 futures is there a way to get these products on metatrader?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
i guess its good because you have lots of leverage, but making those pips is not any easier.

Hi clam, Check this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...1&amp;postcount=13 Hope that helps. Regards, East

--- 帖子 #356 ---
thanks for the help ... but im not sure this shows CME stuff...does it? do spot forex quotes correlate to CME currency futures ? does the s&amp;p 500 correlate to the e-mini s&amp;p 500? i compared futures charts on prophet.net to the ones in metatraer and i dont think they do exactly....im not sure how it works and why it would be different.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hehe.. well, I'm in the dark the same with you on this. As for displaying the futures data, I think you need to have or change to another data provider. Anyway, hopefully others can provide you with the answers. Regards, East

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi Beth Thanks for all that info. I have read Rich Dad Poor Dad a few years ago it is what got me started in trading. I do like the concept of Rob Bookers 10 pips a day it is just with my work and other commitments I can't sit infront of a pc all day trading ( although I would like to ) so I decided I would have to look at larger time frames which I can check in on and trade off them. I also don't really like that because of the larger stops needed. I have also read Strategy 10 and found it really good. I like most of the stuff I have read from Rob Booker and am just looking at buying one of his books. Thanks again Beth Jon

--- 帖子 #359 ---
you know kiyosaki highly advises against stocks and trading right? to him, i say "screw you"! maybe someone can explain to me why this idea is so revolutionary. this is the same idea that people who daytrade the big boards have. throw in $100,000 into microsoft or something, 10 seconds and 10 cents later you have +/- a few hundred dollars.

The chart posted here is on the 1HR timeframe. You need to change the timeframe to Daily for VWB Daily model and 4 HR fo rthe 4 Hr model. The setup is to 1st add Risk model 1 and then overlay the next risk model (2). I don't trade the EURO but perhaps someone who does can post their chart, but I am sure it will make a bit more sense when u change the time frame. Good Trading to you.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi mike, The fib levels are the red lines you see on your chart. They are projections of the 28 EMA which is the blue line if you are using the plugin from Vegas. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Here is a snap of the cable daily as it appears w/ the cable risk models overlaying each other. I changed the colors of the targets to make it easier to ID them.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
thanks for the answers, but here is another screen with daily chart, and you can see that the bar didnt reach the third fib line in 3 monthes. (neither the lower 3 gib line nor the upper third fib line). As iam only allowed to go on with trading when the third fib lines are reached, trading possibilities are pretty rare, arent they? Or do i misunderstand something? Greets mike http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/725...tled6xx.th.jpg btw:what is the tunnel, vegas again and again alludes?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Your screen shot is a 4HR chart. I threw this EUR/USD DAILY together real quick. The tunnel is the Green and Blue 24/28 MA's that are in the center. The first line (red) up or down from the Tunnel is the 89 FIB, the 2nd line (purple) is the 144 Fib and the 3rd (Also Red) is the 233FIB. You'll see that the 233 was pierced on 0605 and reversed (I would have traded this setup, but as mentioned before I don't trade Euro) Do u have the correct indicators installed, if so verify on what time frame u are using them They daily requires the Vegas Currency Daily - these can be found in the beginner forum under one of the stickies. The Vegas indicators produce unreliable results inthe incorrect timeframe. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
At first thanks for your help, i really apprecicate that! oh, you re right this was a 4h, but here daily chart and nevertheless you have to say, that trading oppurtinities are pretty rare. In this example my last trading oppurtinty would have been around the march 19th. Or do i still misinterpret something? Greets mike http://img162.imageshack.us/img162/1...led0lz1.th.jpg

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Your observation looks good. I use Candlesticks adn others use bars so your line chart of closes threw me for a moment. Markets change and in a trending market VWB is probably not the tool u want to be using. But I probably would have traded the 6/5 setup

--- 帖子 #368 ---
so what do you mean, what brings the vegas wealth strategy, if you can trade a maximum of 1time per week? I think i misinterpret something, do i? Or are there more trading possibilities if i take the 4h or 1h tunnel method?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
here is a thread that Vegas started when he returned from his vacation. It explains better than I can re the need to be flexible when the markets are changing. ALso, don't be in such a hurry to find good trades. let them come to you. U can add the 1 and 4 hour methods to your tool box, but get to know one very wel first - then add. http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=5360

--- 帖子 #370 ---
here's a question that no one seems to be able to answer. in VWB, vegas supports the idea of trading currency futures vs. spot forex for USD based currency pairs and S&amp;P futures--both of which are available on Globex. where can one get realtime charts for these futuers with a decent charting application?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I assume vegas uses metatrader for charts and places orders in whatever broker he has and brokers charting system doesnt matter at all.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
the problem is, you can't get CME futures quotes on metatrader

--- 帖子 #373 ---
the market moves the same way

--- 帖子 #374 ---
its similar, but it can be off by decent number of points/pips.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi, I just got to know about Vegas' tunnel/VWB. Would just love to confirm if these are 3 different methods/systems/models, namely: 1) 1 Hour Tunnel Method 2) 4 Hour Tunnel Method 3) Vegas Wealth Builder (1hr/4hr/Daily) Please correct me if I'm wrong...TIA.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi MChurner and welcome to the forum! You're right. They are different methods/systems/models. Regards, East

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Two questions: 1- Where are the indicators for the 1-hour, 4-hour method? 2- Is there an EA that already implements those methods in MT4 or VT ? Thanks in advance for the reply.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Here's a link to VT Trader 1 Hour Tunnel Indicator. DUe to the subjectivety of this method, a Trading System would be pretty difficult to perfect. http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...3&amp;postcount=14

Hi, Im totally a newbie. Ive program the script at MT4 (EURUSD Model #1,#2) and looks like this. Im only suppose to trade when it touches the 2nd last line ([233]) right? Is that the orange lines? I appreciate the help. Thanks

--- 帖子 #380 ---
hi, i was now reading till page 12 and treid to solve my problem, but somehow i failded.. I just dont undestand these parts of the vwb: 3) After initiating a new position, and stops are in place, we look to take 50% of position off at/or around the tunnel. In other words, we book half the position for a profit. Stop on the other 50% of position is raised to an appropriate profit level or breakeven. 4) The last 50% of position is held until we get opposite signal on the other side of the tunnel [first part of step 3]. What does vegas mean with the 50%? are 100% the middle of the tunnel up/down to the outest fib line? Has this something to do with the take profit? Is this the take profit? I hope you can help me. Another thing is the entry point, which is not very clear to me. Iam only allowed to enter when the charts hits the corresponding (it must not close above/below, right?) fib line AND a hammer/inverted hammer, shooting star or hanging man is shown. Are these all conditions for entering, or are there other main conditiones? Iam looking forward to an awnser, very best greetings mike

--- 帖子 #381 ---
A position here means the number of lots you have on a trade. So for example, you have 2 mini lots on a certain trade, what vegas means on "booking half the position when it hits the tunnel" is taking 1 mini lot (50% of 2 mini lots) that you have on the trade. If I remember it right, the tunnel is the 24/28 MA in the daily chart. So when price hits the tunnel (24/28 MAs), then you still have half of your position which is 1 lot. You now then wait for a reversal on the opposite side of the tunnel. So basically, what vegas is referring to the 50% is applied to your position. Hope this helps and not confuse you more. Regards, East

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Hi: Just wondering if either Vegas or some of the more experience traders could help me with this. This is regarding the Daily Trading method (VWB) and the setup on the USD/JPY (see chart below). First a question: 1). I understand that at a minimum, for USD/JPY to setup for a possible trade, it must at least touch the second fib band. My question... if the price/candle is breaks through the 2nd fib and begins trading BETWEEN the 2nd and 3rd fib for several days, do wait for it to hit the 3rd fib before before we look for a reversal, or are we still looking for a possible reversal at this "in between level?" Ok, on the the chart. Could someone take a look at this on the hourly and tell me if these two setups would have met the conditions for a trade (particularly the setup on June 14)? If not, why? Both would have been stopped out. Did anyone take this trade? If I'm understanding the VWB condtions correctly, the conditions for a short trade on 6/14 would have been met. Should this trade have been avoided? Any input from vegas or some of the veterans would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Below is the "Daily" Chart for the USD/JPY:

--- 帖子 #383 ---
hi, thank you for answering, but i still dont get everything, below i posted a screenshot. If i understand it right i have to enter when the referring fib line is broken, but only with 50% of my account. But why? Isnt it much more sensible to take 100%? I dont know for what i need to keep the other 50%. Why cant i simply close the position if i need the other 50%? I would really appreciate if someone could explain it to me. Maybe you can also post a screenshot, where i get a better point of view. Many thanks mike http://img478.imageshack.us/img478/2645/chart4je.th.gif

are u using strategy builder fx? what broker aer you going through?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
yes iam using strategy builder platform and still use the demo account on it. I am looking forward to an answer Greets mike

--- 帖子 #386 ---
You take the first 50 to lock in profits. You take the remaining 50 at the end of the run. Setting an appropriate stop so if it reverses on you you lock in profit on the second 50. This way you capture the full width of the move. If you took 100 percent on your first level, you would leave the other 50 wasted. Waiting to take 100 per cent at the end of the swing means that if the first target was reached and reversed you would have made less than 50 so it's not a good idea. It's about capturing as many pips as possible plus locking in profit. Those are the 2 concepts. But...I could be wrong...sorry i,m a noob. Oh, taking 50% means that if you are for example trading a mini account you would have opened the position with 2 lots(as an example) and in the case of your picture, closed 1 lot at the tunnel thus locking in profit. Now you are in the psychologically advantageous position of being past Break Even on your trade. It's only up from here baby, type of feeling. Now you can focus on the prospect of riding your second lot down to the exhaustion point but if it doesn't make it you protect the distance it has made with a stop loss to lock in further profits.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
minute, in my view thats completly wrong (i mean the calculation). example: graph is at 1.0000, and the tunnel is at 1.0100 and a reverse happens at 1.0200. Furthermore lets assume 1pip = 1$ (if i take my whole account = 100%, so 50% = 0.5$) Lets assume i take 100 percent from the beginning, than i would have made to the tunnel 100pips = 100$, than i go on and set my target at 1.0200 (because i think that there is a reversal), than i will get another 100$, but the trend goes back 50pips in the end, so iam at +150pips .. this means that i have a total of 100 pips + 100 pips -50pips = 150$ If i take the same calculation patter for 50%, than i would have get 100pips +100 pips -50pips = 75, this means the half. So where is the benefit of taking 50%? Maybe someone else could make an example, or explain it more in detail. I would appreciate this. - mike

--- 帖子 #388 ---
vegas recommends you book 50% at the tunnel. the other 50% you can do whatever you want with it. you can secure your profits by exiting at a smaller profit, or you can shoot for the other side of the tunnel for maximum profit. in the process, you can set your stop to a price so at WORST you break even (this includes the 50% that profited), or you can move your stop closer to the current price so that you still end up with some profit.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
so the whole idea is like the bollinger bounce with fib lines (and when the bounce happens, i should take 50% till i reach the tunnel (which is my first target) I hope iam right -mike

--- 帖子 #390 ---
i dont know why you said "take 50% till", its more like you take off 50% WHEN you reach the tunnel. but yeah. its like a bollinger bounce.

Hi all! I am very new to Forex. I have been studying for 2 months now. I read a lot of thread in FF and some books. I did some testing some methods and back to read again. I like the Vegas methods the best so far. I am sure I haven't read 1/100000 what everybody else have. I just looked at the VWB III and I am very interested in but I think I need to read all his method than just subscribe to somthing I have no idea with. I would like to study more about his method first, but the link on FF to VWB part I gives me the error message. Oops, something went wrong!

Hello Guys, I am studying this system and would appreciate your help with regard to the following questions 1) This system initially mentions of EMA's of 144 and 169.as tunnel but later talks of EMA's of 24 and 28. They are not one and the same thing. 2) It also mention of different fib levels like 89, 144, 233, 377 etc, as all these are fib numbers. Whether these are plotted as EMA's. If so how do they come on both sides of primary tunnel of 24 and 28 ema's.( Unfortunately I am not familiar with Metatrader 4) Many thanks in advance. kapanil

Hi guys, I've been investigating Vegas over the last couple of days. Have to say, I have been quite impressed by the amount of discussions in this forum &amp; the constructive criticism. On this note,I'd like to play devils advocate. Based on the rules for initiating trades(if diff between xSMA &amp; yEMA rises/falls , initiate trade) , it looks like this entire method relates to doing a simple MACD. Came across this idea when I was experimenting with both MA's in a MACD. There it was - in my face! The MACD even shows the differences(convergence/divergence). It just seems weird to me that so many posts haven't seen this obvious relation. If I'm missing something, please let me know-as keen as everyone else out there to expand my knowledge &amp; trading profitability.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Vegas, I am new to this forum, and relatively new to forex. While I have made roughly 100% in 4 months using news, I am quite excited to see your 4hr system. After looking at the backtesting results, I realize I could potentially LOVE you ! Thanks for all the hard work you've put in here, and I am excited about trying out your system! I do have a question which I am sure has been answered elsewhere, but I can't seem to find the answer to: You mention that stop loss should be based upon technicals... I'm not sure what you mean by this, and was hoping you could clarify more specifically. Again, a thousand thanks to you

--- 帖子 #421 ---
I believe that by technicals he means support and resistance levels (ie trendlines, MA, prior swing high's/low's). Also since the strategy is meant for the 4h timeframe your stop should be ruther large 80-120 or even more depending on the pairs volatility. If you need a better explanation about the stops let me know and i will post a chart. HTH

--- 帖子 #422 ---
All, I am starting to read from the beginning of this thread about the vegas system and such. I have had several friends refer me to this system. Is this the best way to learn? Start from the beginning of this thread? Thanks, BearPaw

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I've read that part over and over and just don't understand it Everything needs to be within 5 pips distance. Does that mean: - both lines of the tunnel - Current price - the EMA(12) cross. How can that ever happen. The EMA(12) usally lags 3-5 bars. The filter is supposed to find strong trends. But strong trends travel much further than 5 pips in 3-5 bars. Can someone please be so kind to post a detailed description of one such situation? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
'We also define "same price" as being within 5 pips or so of being equal. Sometimes it turns out the signal is exact, but I don't think you have to split hairs on this. Within 5 pips is good enough for us.' I am going to specifically address this particular quote. If I am not mistaken, this portion of the analysis refers to knowing whether two candlesticks, or bars, have made a "double-high" or "double-low"....which is what 'same price' means. Some folks looks for the absolute value of the high/low of both candles to match, but here Vegas is saying that even if the prices are within 5 pips of each other, you can still consider them to be the same price, for our purposes....a.k.a: double-high and/or double-low. The other two comments refer to a different section of the Vegas method, and are not related to the 'same price' analysis. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
The other two comments refer to a different section of the Vegas method, and are not related to the 'same price' analysis. Strange because everything I quotes was presented as one rule/point in 1HrTunnelMethod.pdf on page 8 point 1) of the "PART 3. THE FILTERS"

Ooopppsss...I think you're right, but let me go back to the documentation to be sure. I thought the last portion was referring to price action ONLY. But after reading your origial post again, I think I know what its speaking about. I will also dig up a chart for you where the parameters are exactly as mentioned, then you can 'see' what was meant in the method. Sorry for providing the wrong answer. Didn't mean to confuse you more. I will help clear it up for you in a moment....

Hi, I have just started to trade in forex market, the hard way. Somebody referred me to this site, and I am here. I am absolute new to technicals, how do you suggest I start using the vegas method, I read lot of praises of his hard work, can any one guide me on this?

I am starting to test the 4 hr Tunnel system. Can anybody tell me if we should wait until after the 4 hr candle is completed to trade. Also, do we pay any attention to the MA values of the week which is now forming or do we deel only with the values of previously completed week. Thanks for your help.

go to tunneltrading.com click on downloads click on 4hr method.

anyone watching the 1 H Tunnel? Seems like an imminent upside breakout. Let's see some action (hopefully). GBP/USD

lugmnaz. ive been watching the 1hr chart recently and i think that if price breaks above the 1.9750 mark we could have anoter upward movement.

All I find is Iffy sites selling systems and making all sorts of wild claims about performance of the systems they sell.One has to assume there is no truth in any of the statements they make ...........any one can hide behind the handle on the net ..............and make all sorts of claims ....Like I am a professional trader , been trading for 20 years..............Who is to verify any of this B S El Cid

Hi, The vegas method is a method that was freely posted. The performance and all the instructions and the stats are located here... BTW Vegas Has also been a trader for more than 20 years... I think most of the complaints arising are from the way the web site is run, not his methods. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...86&amp;postcount=1 Please read all the docs.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
As I have said in other threads, the system vegas trades for this signal service is not any of his published systems. Its something new. Just letting you know. I also recall reading threads that say some have backtested the 1 hour tunnel method as vegas says it shoudl be run and they came up with net loss. As far as vegas being a trader for 20 years, it starting to look like he may have traded with mixed results over the course of 20 years, but found fleecing people is more profitable for him. Best Regards, Ah.

All I have ever found at this site is a bunch of helpful, like-minded people that were willing to help and share their knowledge. Nobody has ever attempted to fleece me, quite the opposite actually. I am sure the admins of this site would appreciate it if you could point out the posts were people are selling 'snake oil' so that they can be deleted.

Hi I am currently testing the 4HR model. It is promising thus far. ( all pairs are green) anybody here still with the system?if so I can start a new thread to discuss?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I just developed a system using this same method, It's crazy how similar this one is to mine. I guess great minds think alike

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I´v been trading the 4 Hour system...and it´s working just fine...mean profitable.. In the moment I just started trading the VWB, but using it on all majour pairs , plus T- Note, Oil, Silver and SP 500. I take any signal on the hour , 4 hour and day Chart.( meaning on extreme fibos) Not the channell system, but the counter trend one, looking for extremes, high or low, and then taking the reversal pattern. Just like the original VWB, but on 3 time frames and all those underlyings. Take 50% profit at tunnell, the rest either BEven or go all the way up .I trail a very wide STOP. Just started this week, and took 15 trades: profitable so far and looking good.. The system should work.The hardest part for me is to pick the "right reversal" signal. Consider this as a conservative hypotheticall performance: 100 Trades 70 loosers.(!!) Ech looser is one R ( risk, or negative "marble") BUT : once the trade is far enough, I move my Stop to a o,786 retracement...so my average loss so far was 0,64 R Out of 30 winners: 20 make it "just" to the tunnel, the rest of the position is closed at break even. 10 make it all the way to the other extreme.These are the Big winners, roughly should make 4 R profit on average. Results: -45 (from the 70 loosers) +20 (from the 20 small winners) +40 ( from the 10 big babies) Hypotheticall results: 15 R after 100 Trades. That´s what I shoot for. Vegas scores more than 50 % of the times...so that´s where I need to improve.. Having said that: anybody with discipline should be able to score 30 to 40 % winners, after that, the marbles should accumulate naturally... And I´m sure some of you out there might do even better than 40 % winners. BUT: DISCIPLINE is the key.. I started with 6 loosers in a row...and it´s human to get dicouraged... The following 4 trades were winners and put me back on plus, now it´s improving even more... I´m scoring 33% winners, but have 3 more open positions all in positive territory.. CONCLUSION: worth testing with real money. Real test shows after 1000 trades, with real money, respecting the rules... And yes, like Vegas points out, it´s an art where to put the stop, and where to jump in the trade.. you cannot back test "art".A good cook doesn´t need cook books...Some days it tastes better than others, but satisfaction is guaranteed. Good luck to all... If you can read this, youré already lucky, cause youré alive and breathing, posiblilities are endless..

Hi cuchuflito and any others, Have you been using the vegas methods since your last post. Just curious about your results. I am considering the 4 hour and daily method going forward. I am not really interested in backtested results, but would love to hear how youve done live trading. Thanks, Bill

Hi Is anyone using this method. ive been looking into the method for a while and im getting some good backk test results

--- 帖子 #450 ---
this has proven to be a profitable method over the years IF YOU USE PA AS A FILTER FOR YOUR ENTRIES. If entries are blind or mechanical then its fairly certain that most people will struggle. i know several people that have done well with this method with this filter. i know a hundred that have tried it without a filter with no long term success. just my thoughts, jim

Hello I am trying to use the Vegas 4H model for trading. I was hoping that one of the traders more experienced with this system would check my results. EUR/USD: BULL RUN Pip difference: Last week(ended 04-10-2009): 413 Current week(ended 11-10-2009): 427 Current&gt;Last week-----Initiate Long trade according to Entry rules.

I am also a little confused about the entry rules. However I will post the question on that one once I am clear about the basic trend calculations that I am doing. Regards Neo

--- 帖子 #465 ---
You need to read the vegas currency daily. In there vegas says that the weekly moving averages are to lagging to pick direction. Instead he suggests using the "black dots " to give direction for the 4hr method. Have a read, you'll see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hello I think I might have posted this in the wrong thread. I am using the 4H and Weekly charts, I am using Momentum tunnels. I read through the document that Vegas published cant find anything about black dots. Is this something that was added later? If so, I would greatly appreciate if you could point me to the right document to read. May be I missed something important. Thanks for your help Regards Neo

--- 帖子 #467 ---
If you read the vegas wealth builder, the first part , which is the currency daily, you will see that he updates the 4 hr tunnel method. In this update he says not to use the pip difference on the weekly ma's, as they lag too much. If you want to trade the 4hr tunnel method he suggests using the "black dots" which are part of the currency daily method, to choose your direction for taking the 4hr trades. I hope you have the idea now.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Oh...I thought I had all the documents and had read through them properly. Would you be able to point me to the document? I am having a hard time finding the right documents it seems. I have the: Price tunnel method document, 4h momentum tunnel document. Which other document do I need? Should I search with VWB only? Would really appreciate if you could upload the documents or email(neo1599@hotmail.com) them? Hope I am not inconveniencing you too much. Appreciate all your help Regards Neo

I have the PDF doc with the description of the Vegas Daily Currency but no plug-ins for the fib levels. Does anyone know where I can download them?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Would you mind sharing what you did to get the to show correctly? I'm using build 255 and probably running into the same issue. Thanks

--- 帖子 #474 ---
What exactly do you need again ?

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Sorry, I should have provided a bit more detail. After attaching the 'Vegas Currency Daily' indicator the fib lines show up, however they all seem to be bunched up close to the MA. From the other screen shots provided here it doesn't look like this is correct. You had mentioned that you were using the same platform as me and had had an issue, so I thought it might be similar to mine. Attached is the chart I see after attaching the indicator. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, just not sure. Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
ok There seemed to be internal variable in the source code of the vegas daily/4hr/hrly indicator that was defined differently for build 225. This variable was used to calculate all the MA's. The mql language is not my specialty, but what i did was i modify the source code and recompiled it so it would work for me. Originally my charts looked like yours, so it is probably the same problem. Soooooo.... What exactly do you want ? Do you have all the Vegas wealth builder docs? do you need them? These are no longer available here on FF because of file size. I posted them on another site. see the previous post i made. Do you have the original indicators for the daily, 4hr, and hourly ? Do you want these? The last time I looked, not recently, these were still available on FF. Or do you only want the changes that I made ? or the modified indicator(s) ? Do you know how to use the MQL Language editor and compiler?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I think I have all the original documents, found the link to the external zip file somewhere in the thread. I believe all I need is the modification to the source. I do some programming with other languages, so I'm pretty comfortable working with the editor. I had suspected that it was dealing with the way they were calculated. But I just haven't had the time to dig in and learn much MQL. Thanks

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Here are my changes to the daily and 1hr vegas indicators. There are two indicators per daily and two per hourly. The two indicators with `jpn` in the name are for jpn based pairs only. The files without 'jpn' in the name are for all other pairs. If you have the original indicators you could do a diff/comparison to see the changes that I made.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Excellent work. It is very much appreciated. Thanks to Vegas as well for all he has shared.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi, I have downloaded the vegas daily currency but when I tried to insert the indicator, the lines are all bunched up. I have tried donwloading the modified source code by srelhed and recompile but still the same results. Could someone please help me on this? Thanks

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hello everyone....(newbie alert)....lol. I have just found the thread and respect what Vegas has try to do here, a Pro trader trying to help us small traders out has to be respected. Now to be honest here, I have done nothing more than glance at this thread and at the Vegas doc as it's quite late at night here in the U.K and will keep the serious reading for another time. I have just set-up the EMA's on my 1 hour chart and to me it doesn't look like this system is creating a tunnel. Vegas said that the 169 &amp; 144 EMA's will create a tunnel and when price goes above you buy and when price goes below you sell. Looking at my chart there isn't too much of a tunnel effect going on, and price doesn't seem to sit anywhere close to the EMA's. Price does clip the EMA's here and there but I was expecting a tunnel effect. As said above I am a newbie so I may not even have things set-up on my chart correctly. The EMA's are they applied to close or open etc ?? Am I maybe miles off here expecting a tunnel with the EMA's ?? I will read the thread and the docs thoroughly when I get a chance but can someone maybe put up a shot of one of their charts so I could compare to mine ? The blue line is the 169 EMA. The red line is the 144 EMA. The yellow line is the 12 EMA. Many Thanks and Good Trading Harmudge

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hi guy's, me again....lol. Had a brief read of the Vegas doc part 1 at work today....on the sly. I now have a slightly better idea of what the chart and tunnel should look like, so please disregard the above post. I have been trying to download the zip file that diallist put up on the first page of this thread ( http://www.forexfactory.com/vegas_files.zip ) without success, I get a google message saying - Oops! This link appears to be broken. Where has this page or doc's gone to ?? I have also been trying to find Vegas's site that has been mentioned in some of the doc's - www.tunneltrading.com , also without any success. Have I missed the boat on the above mentioned zip file and the Vegas website. Vegas if your still around and read this. From the brief introduction I have read in your part 1 doc about you starting out in the trading pits etc, you have my ut-most respect for what you have done by bringing your knowledge and insight of what it takes to be a Pro Trader to the forum for all to share. I loved your story of your first day in the pits....."Much Respect". Harmudge

Hello all, as I said in my first post in this thread a few days ago that I would probably have a few more questions to follow...lol. Can one of you kind folk please take a look at my chart for me and tell me if there is anything missing ?? There seems to be so many attachments associated with this thread that you guy's have put up, but I don't really know which is which....lol. I looked at the attachment file that is on diallist's post (number 1 of this thread). Located at the top right of that post and downloaded and inserted the attachments on my chart named :- Vegas Currency Daily_dwe Vegas S_P Daily As you can see from the attached snap-shot of my chart I have 24 &amp; 28 EMA's (should they not be 169, 144 &amp; 12 EMA's as in the VWB doc ??)and what looks to me to be 3 Fibo lines either side of those EMA's. What's making me think I have something missing is, that fairly early on in the thread....where I am still reading, incidentally....some members are asking for help loading the necessary indicators onto their charts and people are saying you need to load this file and that file twice and it should be numbered 1 and 2 etc etc so you have the Fibo lines either side of the EMA's. You should also have risk model this and risk model that ?? This is one of those questions about loading the Fibo's etc (Posted by pabad) Start of pabad's post:- EUR/USD - Model # 1 AND Model #2. Overlay #2 after you have setup Model #1. Just go back and do #2. This will now produce an overlap of #1 and #2 And produce 4 fib lines on both sides of the tunnel [for a total of 8]. You will now have fib numbers calculated at 89, 144, 233, and 377 from the daily tunnel. When I pull up the daily chart on MT4 for EUR/USD with the Vegas indicator, I see on the upper left hand corner: RISK MODEL #1 (1-4) How do I overlay #2 so that 4 fib lines are displayed on both sides of the tunnel as stated above? End of pabad's post. "Me again"......I only had to load the above noted files once and seem to have Fibo lines both sides of the EMA's, but I only have risk file 1 showing in the top left of my chart with numbers 1-4 in brackets ?? What is this risk file ?? I'm sorry if all my questions seem dumb, but as stated earlier I am a newbie and have merely taken the first steps of Forex enlightenment.....we all have to start off somewhere and you yourself were once where I am now, so come on guy's help a newbie out and spread some good trading karma....just as Vegas himself done for you guy's when he brought his trading model to the forum. "What goes around comes around". Best Wishes Harmudge

I can here you all moaning and groaning....."Here we go again, this pain in the butt with another question".....lol. To diallist or anyone else that can answer this question :- PF, I take to mean Private Forum. On page 8 of this thread diallist mentions the PF (private forum). To which private forum are we talking about ? Are you reffering to Vegas's site that he mentioned in his doc's (that I can't seem to find) or the James16 group private forum ?? Best Wishes Harmudge P.S Am I the only one keeping this thread alive ?? Thanks to srelhead who gave me a reply last night but no-one else got any input to my questions ??

--- 帖子 #487 ---
yup you are keeping this thread alive. pf. i believe is the james16 private forum. james16 started one of the more notable threads here at FF. It is in the commercial section. It is a must read. Here's the link. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=2331 james16 himself said the the vegas method combined with his PA methodology works fairly well.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
The PF has a trading system called the Knife which is based off the 4hr vegas. It is suppose to be a money maker. I think the stuff vegas posted is of value, you just have to figure out how to make it work for you. This thread pretty much died when vegas went commercial. not a lot activity since then.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
if you have any questions just pm me. some history. long ago vegas got involved here with a couple of systems. they were very popular and vegas took them commercial. the last i heard vegas had disbanded and dissapeared (thats what i heard-i could be wrong) during those early years dial created a variation called the knife (with vegas' approval) and it was included in the pf. dial was buried and burned out and decided to turn it over to a student within the pf. that person still teaches it (for years now) and it remains a popular section within the pf. jim

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hi Guy's, I'm back....lol. O.K I have read this thread through and also read the VWB document, and am currently reading the VWB2 thread and document. It would be greatly appreciated if some of you guy's that have implemented this trading model could confirm wether I have got my head around this correctly. This is how I think this model should be worked :- 1) Watching the relative pairs as mentioned in the VWB you wait for price to get to the outer Fib's (#2 for some pairs,#3 for some pairs), once price has touched or breached them thats when you sit-up and take notice. 2) Once price is at the outer Fib's you are then watching for a reversal candles such as Hammers, Hanging Men, Shooting Stars etc. 3) Once you have got the reversal candle, next day you gauge the current days range (Hi and Low) from the Asian open and measure a 50% of this range. 4) What you are looking for next, is a good tall candle or two to breach this 50% measure of the current days range (momentum). You don't want the breach of the 50% measure to be broken by like...say 10 small candles or so...you want strong candles breaching this 50% measure. 5) Once this 50% has been breached by say 5 pips or so then enter the trade. I know that there is more to it than that but this is sort of where I am at, at the moment with my reading and understanding of the model. Say during the Asian session trading is low for that currency pair and the Asian range is only 30 - 40 pips, what do you do then ?? Vegas also mentioned either in one of his posts or doc's something about ranges above 60 pip's but I can't remember what it was now....maybe a re-read is on the cards...lol. Also the excell file and this median, can someone maybe enlighten me about this median ?? I think that it has something to do with "me" in-putting the historical price data of the open, high and close of the pair you are watching and then the excell file gives you the median....which in my thinking is the middle (median) of your daily average.....i.e this would be your 50% measure (retracement) to save you having to measure or work it out for yourself, so once price has breached this median by 5-10 pips you enter the trade. Would my thinking of this be correct ?? Or am I miles off ?? Best Wishes Harmudge

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Been doing some more reading and think I may have found the answer to the 60 pip range question and the median question I asked above. With most pairs with decent volatility if price retraces 60 pips or more there is a very good chance it ain't turning back to make a new high or low of the day or whichever came first. What I mean by that for an example is :- Say price opened for the day at 100 it then went down to 70 then went up to 140. So we have a current low for the day of 70 and a current high of the day at 140 plus we have a range of over 60. If price then re-traced over 50% of the 140 back down to 70, there is very small chance of price then re-tracing back higher than 140 and making a new high for the day. Median is merely the high and low of the days range. Would be great if someone with a bit of experience could look over this question and the one above and confirm if I'm on the right track. James16, I know you said in your post above I could PM you if I had any questions. I have refrained from doing this as I didn't want to be a pain in the butt....lol.....but would really value any input you may have to my questions. P.S I read the Vegas Wealth Builder 3 thread the other day, what a shame things seemed to go pear shaped. Vegas seemed like such a nice guy in his posts. P.P.S I have also got my head around setting up the charts and the risk model question I asked a couple of posts back. P.P.P.S.....LOL. Sorry guy's but I am still a bit confused with this Median. I thought I had it earlier. I was putting a moving average on a chart and noticed in the moving averages settings that the setting for setting the moving average to the high and low of the candle, bar etc had median in brackets next to it. So I thought that was what Vegas was refering to as the Median, but I have just been back re-reading the Vegas Wealth Builder 2 doc and on page 8 of the doc where he is explaining the column's in his excell database he says :- "Column E is the twenty day moving MEDIAN (not average) of the range.This number means that 50% of the last twenty days are above and 50% of the last twenty days are below." Now if you look at the screen shot I have loaded of the actual doc and look in column E there are like 3 numbers 128, 136 etc etc. So would it be that 50% of the last twenty days ranges have been above 128 pips (as an example) and 50% of the last twenty days ranges have been below 128 pips etc ?? "You know" I ain't getting to many responses to my questions here, admittedly the thread is very old and probably most of the original posters have gone of to pastures new, but merely by me putting these questions up it is making me think in more detail about this trading model and think more about the questions I am asking about the trading model. I am going back to the doc's and thinking more about what is said in them and I generally feel the penny is slowly dropping and I am getting it clear in my head. I would still really appreciate if someone could confirm wether I am on the right path here.

It looks like not many of the traders from the past are monitoring or care about this thread any more. That is too bad. I never fully looked into the Vegas Tunnels, even though it looked very interesting at the time, and I made a mental note to look into them later. But now it looks like he has dropped off the face of the earth. I wonder if your best option is to join the James16 Private Forum?

harmudge there is nothing wrong with the pf. most of the information in the pf is in the james16 public thread though. i hope you went through that first. if you have to spend some $ to learn forex trading, the pf is one of the better ones. it is certainly better then the "forex made easy" as seen on tv.

well i've been to the public form and am on page 50 little bit to go and then will consider joining sometimes to much info just goes other the head when you are not ready for me time to study

Hi srelhead, Thanks for chipping in....don't what the guy above was on....must be strong though....lol. Yeah I have had a mosey at the public thread. I think I got up to page 100 odd, then got sidetracked....lol. Got to agree, a lot of the material is freely available in the public forum....and to be honest I would definately advise anyone thinking of joining the J16 group to read the public thread first.....you will be better equipped for whats on the other side that way....some of the material is a bit techy....for a complete newbie. Well worth the monthly subs though.... ...big-up for the guy's at J16.

I think J16 and Strat's thread are the best on FF if you are looking to trade daily timeframes. I have had better results with them than anything I have used so far. Takes time to learn, but worth it. Dave

I came across your thread a few hours ago and tried it with my chart program. Wow!!!!! I find that your ema 144X169 on 60 minutes chart is the best to filter long/short selection for short term swing trader like me. Thanks thanks thanks. A lot of thanks. Then I go a little further to implement your system. I use the number 144 and 169 in MACD with 25 (5x5) for signal. It really looks good. I am going to test the system next week on the real market. wizzz wizzz9@hotmail.com

Hi all, I'm searching this forum (and the Internet) a couple of hours but I'm not able to find correct download link for: vegas_files.zip file. The download link on the first post is not working. To milto: Did anybody help you? Any help will be welcome, Joe

--- 帖子 #517 ---
No no one got the time to give me an answer till yet !!!!

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Milto, I've found this one, but I'm not sure it is an original. There isn't chart for e-mini S&amp;P 500 for example. I was not able to attach this file here (limit for junior member). I will send you it by e-mail. Happy Trading, Joe

bit surprised to see this thread resurrected - I thought that the Vegas stuff was a scam.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
I have a copy. I can email them to you

Hi all, read about the Vegas Wealth Builder. I am not very sure about the 4hr setup. Any one can guide me??

--- 帖子 #420 ---
just sent the file today. sorry for the delay

--- 帖子 #421 ---
The Vegas 4 Hr tunnel is closely related to the Knife. do a search here at FF on knife. There is a group in the james16 pf that follows the knife. The documentation for the 4h tunnel was fairly straight forward. What kind of question do you have ?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hey Srelhed, I'd pay you or exchange some info to get those emailed to me as well. I lost mine due to a lovable dog and don't have a copy on my computer. lol The 4 hour method has the possibility to make you very rich if you use your head with it. It's all about those A+ setups.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
whats your email ? what kinda of info?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
where is the actual method for the knife system ? also, are the vegas methods scams ? have they actually worked for anyone over a period of two years with constant monthly profits ? regards

--- 帖子 #425 ---
If you back test it you will see it gives very consistent profits

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi srelhed, I also like to have a copy from the vwb part 1 my email adress is imranctgbd@yahoo.com Many thanks

Hi All, Can anyone help me please? I have been trying to piece togther the separate elements of the Vegas Model VWB 1, 2 and I also saw mention of 3 (for which there seemed to be a charge). I think I have the WB2, but I am not sure I "gathered" all the differerent downloads, but I could not find a working link for VWB 1, which seems to be a prt-cursor for VWB 2. Can anyone help please. If e-mailing is better I am nigelphilpott99@yahoo.co.uk Many thanks in anticipation Nigel

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Don't personally recall a version 3. But there was a 1 &amp; 4 hour setup as well as the daily. It's been so many years since I even looked at vegas but I have a file with all the documents &amp; indicators etc.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Dear Willf, Thank you so much, what a star you are for replying so quickly and with full detail - Cannot thank you enough (sometimes it can take an age to trawl through threads and within a thread to piece a model together). Do I take it you no longer execute the strategy, may I further enquire your view if you had any experience please ? Once again thanks for taking the time to reply to me Yours Nigel

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I no longer use it. I tried it for a while but signals seemed few and far between. Basically you wait for price to reach the outer price bands and then look for a reversal signal. That reversal signal never always happened or was a false move. Having said that I did use the bands as a guide for taking profits and that worked out better although not the original purpose of the system. Vegas was one of many systems on FF that had a huge following and just fizzled away. Vegas did start a private group which I joined but it all fell apart when he started offering a signal service.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
you are right. didnt work for me either in my demo testing...

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hello... ! Vegas Built still active? I am interested in this model and also sought information. I am JYamamoto and I live in Japan, I am new to the group. Sorry but my English is not good. Thanks
