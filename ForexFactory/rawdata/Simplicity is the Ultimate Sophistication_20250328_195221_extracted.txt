Hello everyone, Im going to share with you all a system which can produce pips daily. I believe "Less is More" and simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. so i think the simpler the better. its a strategy that i develop myself, but it was inspired by many traders. Im going to share my strategy because others has contributed to me as well. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO: 1.Open the EURUSD Pair, then wait the last two candle before the london market open(i use icmarket, so its 8.00 candle time)hourly candle, wait until it close. 2.look at the highest and the lowest that the 8.00 candle made. 3. at 9.00 opening candle see the market whether its going down or going up. If its going down, put the sell stop the first 00 level under, and if it going up, put the buy stop at the first 00 level above the 8.00 candle. 4. Put the TP 10 PIPS and SL: 15 PIPS 5.If the TP hit then close your computer. 6.if its hit sl then see the market, see the high/low of the first 00 level above/under the 8 pm, place an order on that level with triple lots. 7. Close computer.&amp; usually the TP will be hit. If SL still hit, then enough for today. close your computer, accept your loses and get out. 8.Repeat on the others day. The strategy constantly changing for better perfomance, please read from post one until the last post. Strategy UPDATED on 10/7/2017 Ive recently improved the new strategy, and make it better. So please use the updated one .because the updated one is so much better ! So what you need to do is: 1. one hour before london open, open two trades. Open buy stop and sell stop on the 00 level .Entry point is still the same(on 00 level above and under the 8 o clock candle.). The different is the SL and TP. One trade use 12 pips Take profit, and 10 Stop loss. One trade use 5 pips Take profit and 10 Stop loss. Now i didnt use martiangle anymore, so there are no triple lots! IF we both Profit then we gain 17 pips. if we lose one trade we lose only -5pips. If we lose both we lose 20 pips.(which is rarely happens). So there are 3 possibilites would happen here everyday. 2. Cancel the buystop if sellstop is executed, or cancel the sellstop if buystop is executed. 3. Just let it be! MONEY MANAGEMENT: I SUGGEST YOU ALL only open a trade 1% from the equity. so when you lose, you only lose 1.55%(with sl 15pips and commision) and when you do the martiangle with triple lots, you only risk maximum of (approx 4.75%) If you trade acc with big amout of money i suggest the less is better. which means you can open only 0.5% of your money, and its really safe. PSYCHOLOGY: THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF TRADING, WHATEVER HAPPEN TO THE TRADE ON THAT DAY,LIMIT THE TRADE, FOR ME I LIMIT MYSELF ONLY TRADE FOR 2 TRADES A DAY. AND WHATEVER HAPPENS,THEN ACCEPT IT. YOU CAN TEST THIS METHOD, THE HIT RATE FOR THIS STRATEGY EXTREMELY HIGH! PLEASE DO A BACKTEST AND ALSO FORWARD TEST! (Reminder) ITS SIMPLE, BUT NOT EASY ! Because another member asked me to not posted the sweetspot indicator(and indicator which can show 00 level , so i just deleted the indicator). Please search it for yourself if you need the indicator, there are a lot of it in this forum. THIS METHOD NEED A BROKER WHICH HAS SMALL SPREAD, IF YOU HAVE BROKER WITH BIG SPREAD DONT TRADE THIS STRATEGY! IF YOU WANT TO ASK ME WHAT BROKER I USE OR WHICH BROKER I RECOMMEND YOU CAN PM AND ASK ME. If you earn and profit with this strategy. I hope you can do charity, or help others who are in need! (im giving this simple strategy free anyway). Life is simple, and it is not all about money. I hope i can help you, and you can help others. .

Do You mean H1 candles?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Yeah, 1H candle.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
i know the sweetspot gold lines are 10 pips apart but how do i factor in the spread? is it added to the ten pips profit/SL or its separated sorry for the newbie question(am one). thanks

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi Zen, I always love simple systems myself. Just want to share a fair warning to those using this system as to what kind statistical edge is needed to trade these kinds of systems. You should only trade this system if your spreads are maybe .1 or .2 pips. Definitely, nothing more than .5 pips and the images below will explain why. If you have a spread of 1-2 pips you need avoid this system or trade it on a much larger time frame with say 150 pip stop and 100 pip target. Attached Image Attached Image Attached Image Attached Image Attached Image As can you see, if you have a 2 pip spread trading this system, you need an 8% edge over the traditional break-even rate... just to break even. People like to pretend they are fighting against other traders in the market and this why they almost always lose. You will never win fighting the wrong enemy. Your true enemy is the statical disadvantage the spread provides you when using SLs and TPs

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Zentrader8: thank you for this. I just have a few questions: 1. What do you consider the market opening time? 8am or 9am? And is that the open of London or the open of Frankfurt? Many people combine them and say the "open". I've heard soooo many different answers to that question but since you require it in your method, you should be the one to define it for us. 2. Have you tried it for US or Asian sessions? If "Asian open", then what time would that be since Tokyo and Sydney have completely different market times. Wouldn't that be two different market open times?? Oftentimes, people just lump these times together... Euro, Asian, US. It's too confusing and as I said, your method requires it so we need to hear it from you.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
"No Spread - WR to BE" should be 60% not 40%.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thank for pointing that out. I had just 1 - the wrong variable in the formula. Despite that, the edge required to make up for the spread remains the same. The main thing of the spreadsheet is the Win Rate needed to make up

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Zentrader, can yu post some charts ?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Looking for this and statistical past result with this system

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Very easy to find out if an edge exists with an ea----anyone?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi zentrader, Thank you for your method. I've one question: what you do, if first stop loss hit, but than price comes back and moving forwards? For example: first buy stop triggers. Than sl, but than price goes not down. It goes up again. Do you than buy again at the same price where the first buy order was?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
If you can have a spread of .01, I am almost positive an edge will exist trading with weekly daily and hourly trends. You can even quantify the edge by seeing how likely a green candle is to form, when the trend is long vs a red candle. Usually 1-2% more likely. I've done the math my self in excel. If I can find the old spreadsheet on my computer I will post it here for you guys. This means the win rate needed to make up to be profitable will have to be less than this 1-2% margin. Which would leave you with a minuscule edge that would disappear should any slippage or spread widening occur.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Yes it is included already. I recomend a broker which has a small spread, for me i use icMar**t and the average spread is 0.1,0.2 and sometimes it even can be zero.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi Sis.yphus yes im quite agree, for a trading strategy like this we need a high win rate, and also a low spread broker.Thats why i really recomended you to choose the lowest spread broker you can get to trade this strategy.if the spread is higher, it will decrease the winning rate for this kind of strategy. and the reason why i only trade eurusd is also because the spread for this pair is quite small.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Answers: 1.London open is at 10.00(i use icmarket), i look at 8.00 candle . and wait until it close.then can start to trade at 9.00 candle opening.(if there any 00 levels touched) 2.Nope, i only trade 1 hour before london open.because that time the price will have momentum that can push the price to touch TP.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
IF someone can make the EA for this strategy that would be great!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
It depends, for me i still took it. The importance is, For me i just limit my trade 2 times a day.Whatever happens, just accept it.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi zentrader, for the entry on 8 of March 2017 am i right to say we buy at 1.0570 (hit SL), and then reenter sell 3 times lot size at 1.0550?? or is it reenter at 1.0560?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Actually the answer is depends on the price action, the more close 00 levels from the 8.00 candle. its better, means the price still has a lot plenty of room to go down or to go up. In this case enter at 1.0550 or 1.0560 levels both end in profit.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Sell stop at 1.0590 TP at 1.0580 SL at 1.0605 lets see.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
On the same trade

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I must misunderstand the system,London has not opened yet but your already in a trade,i thought you waited until after London open?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Have you ever tried to Put your stpp at breakeven at your target to get some more Pips? Or other trade Management Strategies ?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
SL hit, open second trade with triple lots buy stop at 1.0610 SL :1.0595 TP :1.0620 Lets see..

--- 帖子 #27 ---
SL hit, now at 1.610 Buy Stop with 3 Lots?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Nope, i open after 8.00 candle time, sometimes it hit when london opens,sometimes it hit before.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
buy stop triggered

--- 帖子 #30 ---
NOpe, i like to keep it simple. If you want you can try others money mangement. but id like to keep it simple ,and keep repeating it. IF you take more than 10 pips it will increase the risk to not touch your tp, or only BE. and the win rate will be change.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks,i'm getting mixed up with different time zones,i've re read the rules,my bad,sorry

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hmmm so assuming u win 1% a day, and on a bad day , u will lose approx~1.5% + 4.5%....have you tested this system for over 90% win rate? Or else I don't really see the math adding up...

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi, zentrader8 ,Can you share your Sessions Indicator.thank you.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Zentrader, what, if the candle after the 8:00 candle is an inside-bar, do you wait for the next candle, or do you place a buy-stop and a sell-stop at the 00 level above/below the 8:00 candle?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi Zentrader8 Very nice system. just started trading it this morning and I notice on your chart. You have an indicator that put lines and the name of the cities New York, Sydney Tokyo, London, could you please share this indicator. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Zentrader8, thanks for your share, your strategy seem solid, i got notification from icm.... broker about server time changing from gmt+2 to gmt+3 start next week, do we need to change our start candle from 08.00 to 07.00 for next week? thanks

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Do this really works? For how long you testing this method? I like to use this system. im using admiralmarkets as broker at what candle do i need to look at?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
The SL is bigger then the tp

--- 帖子 #39 ---
That doesn't matter. 1:1.5 RR and 1.5:1 RR have the exact same expectancy. The only difference is the frequency in which your losses and wins will be distributed and the sizes of the losses and wins. See more here Again. The only thing you ever really need to worry about with any system is how to overcome the statistical disadvantage of the spread. This disadvantage gets larger the tighter your stops and targets are. Using one R:R over another isn't going to save you. All it does it change the frequency of your wins and losses along with their sizes.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
win +10 pips, loss -15 pips first, 3*(-15pips) second = -60 pips. 1:6. (repaired)

--- 帖子 #41 ---
if we lose one day both trades, we have 1x -15 and 3x -45 = -60 pips We need to win the following next 6 days to be BE.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
today result TP hit. Done for today.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Please reread the rules and check it for yourself, i already explain the rules clear enough i think. check the candle 2 hours before the london open,wait until it close and trade at the new candle form. Whether a strategy works or not, its not only depends on the method, it depends more on the trader, we can trade the same method but the results might be different. So it not merely depends on the method itself.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Yes Sis.yphus. quite agree.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Today are u ended with green pips ?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
yes, the second trade was nice

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Or four days has to be winning the second position. (-15 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 15).

--- 帖子 #48 ---
here was I understand, please let me know if I wrong. the day 07 March 2017. The chart is a M1 chart and the H1 candles are the bigger one :-) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Yup There are vary of money manegement you can use to trade this method. 1.Open the first with 1 lot , and the second with triple lots.which can recover the loses straightly if you win, but will give you loses with 4x if the trade loses.(martiangle for single day) 2.Open the first trade with 1 lot, and the second with triple lots, then if it still loses. the next day, open with triple lots the last lost lots(keep doing martiangle until you win) 3.Open the first trade with 1 lot, and the second also with 1 lot(means no martiangle, purely depends on win rate). YOu can research a new method except those three, and share it here. maybe it can improves our trading. Since im still considering and thinking how to handle consecutive loses.

and one more, was a little tricky to see Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #51 ---
my last for this week at Friday the trade need long time right? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Yes you are right!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi zentrader8 Could you please tell me what is the significance of rule 2. What are we looking for in the highest and lowest of the 8 o'clock candle. rules 2.Open the EURUSD Pair, then wait the last two candle before the london market open(i use icmarket, so its 8.00 candle time)hourly candle,wait until it close. 2.look at the highest and the lowest that the 8.00 candle made. thank you.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Pretty sure if the take profit is 10 pips and the stop loss is 15, then the required win rate to break even would be 60%, not 40% (assuming zero spread). besides the fact it doesn't work perfectly, that's a handy "calculator". Did you make it Sis.yphus?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
the rule2 is to filter the wrong trade, and only trade the right trade. You can try to backtest it, and see the result. The winrate is very high.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
This method sounds a lot like the London Open strategy. Each time it is marketed, it seems the market makers hear about it and start sweeping both directions at the London Open to activate the pending orders each way, then roll up and down to collect all the SL's. I don't trade this style, but have seen it discussed several times. It was created by a lady named Cynthia, or Shirley, if I remember correctly, and sold as a system. Apparently, it is now okay to pirate it? HA, that is why you cannot disclose real strategies, lol. Anyway, I do not remember the time frame others used. Maybe on an hour chart you will have better success? Not sure. If too many people start doing it again, they will start sweeping again. The market moves on pending orders and they are visible and lined up for banks to see. In my opinion, this is a risky strategy, but only because I trade London and New York and am familiar with the London Open swings that are most likely designed just to kill this method. Good Luck. By the way, the past several months have been influenced by a bull market per Trump being elected. Many trades from November to mid-February began 2 hours before the London Open, so if that is the basis for your entry, lol, you are in for a shock. Review the markets prior to the election, and you will see all the swings at the London Open. Just friendly advice

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks for your advice, But im not pirate it. As i wrote in the first page, i said i was inspired by others, but i developed my own strategy. My trading strategy it doesnt wait for london open. and its up to you whether you said its same or not.I dont care. I just show the way to profit in the market.just share to others some edge in the market. and you said that if many people doing it, bank will start to sweep again. I just can laugh bro, if retailer trader like me, who only trade 1-10 lots,can change the way they trade and change how the price move. You can see and backtest for yourself bro, if it doesnt fit you, just dont trade it. Keep it simple bro

BUY STOP 1.0710 TP 1.0720 SL 1.0705 Lets see

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Zen, but the 8:00 hour candle did not closed yet?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
shouldn't the buystop be at 1.0720?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Nope its closed already .Please see the pic.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
yes, but the high of the 8:00 hour candle is over 1.0710, thought we should use the next round number (1.0720)?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Nope, please see the pic. maybe the broker we use is different. so the data feed and the candle different as well.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
ok, at my broker the high is 1.0713

--- 帖子 #65 ---
green Day :-) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #66 ---
great for you bro, im ended with green pips as well.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
first trade sl, second trade open and TP. End the day with green pips. Done for the day

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Is there any amount of time we should give the 9.00 candle, before we determine if it's going up or down. Is it seeing if it goes up or down in the first ten seconds, and enter the order. Or do you give it a bit more time to settle it's direction (ie. 10 minutes)?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
[quote=PipSeer;9646906]Zentrader8: thank you for this. I just have a few questions: 1. What do you consider the market opening time? 8am or 9am? And is that the open of London or the open of Frankfurt? Many people combine them and say the "open". London opens at 8:00 GMT, here is a time converter.... http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Nope, there is none, for me now i just trade the firs 00 levels touched. there is no fix amount of time to touch the levels.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
[quote=AceVenturaNL;9657494] Neither, i dont consider the market opening time at 8, or 9. Just look at the hourly candle charts.two hours before london open. wait until it close and see the high and low from the candle. in my broker i use icmarket. so the london open at 10.00 i look at 08.00 candle, wait until it close and trade the 00 levels above and below.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
thank you for the explanation, and sharing this system. I just have one last question, today your first trade went to sl? The first 00 level below the low of the 08.00 candle was 1.069. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Wouldn't you have had your stop sell at that level, with tp at 1.068 &amp; sl at 1.0705? (just as 4x4free chart suggests)

--- 帖子 #73 ---
So, high/low of candle 2hrs prior to London open. Mark high/low Then as 0900 candle starts, as soon as it penetrates either the previous candle high/low, place order at next .00 level to buy or sell with TP at next .00 level and S/L at 15 pips. If first trade hits SL, then trade once more with x3 position but still in direction of second candle (one prior to London open) at next .00 level? OR do you wait for the candle to close after your 0800 candle? The await direction of 0900 candle is too ambiguous, as looking back at charts, many times the candle starts one way in first 5mins then goes the other? Nice simple system tho for my wife to trade which is what I was looking for!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
What are the rules for long or short? By color signal H1 candles?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
See attached eg from last Monday. The 0900 candle signal was unclear as initially went higher but closed lower than its open. But as 0900 high penetrated the 0800 high, we are looking for Longs, so order placed at next .00 level. (1.06100) TP at 1.06200

--- 帖子 #76 ---
The direction is determined only when London opens?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
yeah, the first trade hit the sl, open the second trade and hit the TP.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Yes. You are right. but im not waiting for the 9.00 candle to close, just simply trade the first 00 levels hit.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
please read the rules. not gonna help you, if you aint read the rules. Thanks

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thanks Zen, clearer now.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Excuse. Through a translator I must deduce as Sherlock Holmes.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Alright, so you just open buy stop / sell stop at whatever 00 level gets hit after the 09.00 candle opens.. Quoting zentrader8 BUY STOP 1.0710 TP 1.0720 SL 1.0705 Lets see {image} I was confused because in rule number 3 you seem to indicate the 08.00 candle high and low had some significance. The next 00 level above the 08.00 candle was 1.072. If you had your buy stop at that level, the order would never had been triggered.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
You have to check your broker time. I believe zentrader was referring to the close of 0800 candle as reference for IC markets , might be different from other brokers. My timezone is +8 GMT, so is at 2pm for +8 GMT.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I check some last Trading days start 19 Jan 2017, but careful it will be different by other Broker, I decide at GKFX MT4 and trade at Dukascopy because of the small Spread and this is important, same at the 23 Jan 2017, the price come for 0.7 pips near the SL but my Broker had only 0.2-0.5 pips spread. may you take some broker with the small spread and commission so its better. I check 20 trading days, 19 Jan - 26 Jan and 01 Feb - 20 Feb 2017 between Jan and Feb some 1 minute data was missing, so this 20 days the result, trade first 1:1.5R and second if need 3:4.5R, was: 10 days normal winner +1R 09 days second Trade winner +1.5R 01 day loss -6R all together +17.5 R we just trade probabilities and they look not bad! Thank you zentrader8 for your method

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Yeah, glad if the method can help you.Hope this method will bring some green pips to all of us. See the hitrate quite high right? We dont know where the market move, we just trade the probability. If you can ,please also did backtest also in 2016 or even 2015,

--- 帖子 #86 ---
yeah, I was looking at the wrong candle. thanks.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Today trade first trade: buy stop 1.0660 tp; 1.0670 sl : 1.0645 SL hit Second trade open: sell stop 1.0640 TP: 1.0630 SL: 1.0655 TP hit End the day with green pips

--- 帖子 #88 ---
really cool if this works in the long run!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
yeah, it is simple method

--- 帖子 #90 ---
i get a lower or the same spread about 0.2-0.4 on eurjpy so i will try this pair aswell on demo lets see how it goes in the long run

--- 帖子 #91 ---
never tried to trade eurjpy with this method before, i suggest you do a little backtest first and if it looks good you can do a forward test, and lets us see the result

--- 帖子 #92 ---
yes i will do this tommorrow morning! a year backtest should be enough for the beginning, isnt it?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
yes , i think its enough for the beginning, after you get the data, please give me the update, im curious about the result.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
i will and im too i will test with 1 lot each trade your money management 0.3 spread and a commision of 6 Dollar. So we get a bit real data

--- 帖子 #95 ---
My feed signal H1 candle high was already above 1.0660 so my next level was 1.0670 which didn't activate. The lower bound was 1.0630 as the H1 low was 1 pip below 1.0640 so I went to next level down. Activated at 1.0630 then stop hit at 1.0645. If the H1 signal candle touches the 00 level would you drop to the next one down or trade that 00 level? Thx

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi Zen, this neat little indy should make life a bit easier (thanks to Gumrai). Just input the desired hourly candle and it will auto draw the high and low. Should make back-testing easier too. I am a little confused about your trade today. You said your first trade hit SL, but I dont see how your buy stop was triggered because the hourly candle before london open never crossed that high, or even came close to it. It did trigger your sell stop which went to TP. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I am confused too, looks like Zentrader is not using the candle two hours before London open, but 3 hours before London open to mark the high/low.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Ok, I looked at charts again and I think Zen might have had a little mix up because of the Daylight saving time changes . His buy stop level matches with the candle high of the previous candle (which would be incorrect according to his rule) but his sell stop matches with the low of candle after that one (which I assume should be the correct one).

--- 帖子 #99 ---
yes, that is my thinking, too

--- 帖子 #100 ---
after the sl got hit on the first trade, you don't ever use limit order (like chart below at 1.065). only ever stop order (at 1.064). As technically 1.065 is the next 00 level below the "8:00 candle".

--- 帖子 #101 ---
You do not have to defend your technique to me. I don't care about it. All good. Just telling you what might happen because it happened A LOT in the past. You are placing pending orders, and that is how the big banks trade. The market makers SEE ALL the pending orders and then play around with them to create panic, activate one direction, and then swing the other to hit the stops. Think about it, just for a mere second. It is all they have. It is all they can do. They create chaos to cause traders to panic, or they activate orders and swing them the other way to activate stops. There is only one remaining thing they do, and that is slow roll orders when there are many on both sides. That creates consolidation areas. Think like a market maker and trade through their BS. For me, this does not trade through them since they can see what you are doing, and it is very common. Best of Luck. You don't have to defend it, just use it and make money and cover your six for when they play games with your targets.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
The High Low is dependent on your broker. For Icmarkets the high hit 1.06599 , so thats why zentrader entered buy stop at 1.066. However, if your broker high is 1.06600 and above, then it would be a simple sell stop take profit. Different brokers might end up with different trades due to quote difference.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
yea the time when to set pendings is not really clear..

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Actually, when you are using hourly time frame [and lower], everyone has the same high/low world-wide (might differ by a pip or two max). Daily and 4Hr candle high/low are broker dependent. What differs is that it might be morning for me when that hourly candle forms, and it could be night for someone, so the exact time differ from broker to broker. But that is not what we are talking about here. I am using ICMarket chart by the way. Either I am wrong in my understanding of what Zen meant, or he made an honest mistake because of the sudden DST change, which means the 8:00 candle is not valid. Should be 9:00 candle for him. Might change to 8:00 again when Europe changes time in a week. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Actually it is very clear. 1. Mark the high and low of SECOND hourly candle before London Open. [that means you have to wait for it to close ]. It can be 8:00 for zen, 10:00 for someone else, 2:00 etc. Just make sure it is two hours before open . 2. Place buy and sell pending orders based on closed hourly candle. 3. Now you wait for the next candle, which is the FIRST hourly candle before London Open [which is also Frankfurt/Europe Open]. This candle will either trigger one or both orders, depending on what breaks first and how far it moves before TP/SL. You manage the trade.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Actually it's not because Zen has been using the 8:00 candle which is actually the THIRD hourly candle before London Open. Either Zen has been confused and trading the wrong candle since US daylight savings, or he is confused about when London open is. Either way, it's not particularly clear. But seeing his actual trades on his charts, I will assume he meant the THIRD hour candle (8.00 ICmarkets) before London Opens..

buy stop at 1.063 sell stop at 1.061 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Zen, please correct me if this is wrong..

That's what I was trying to say too. What I meant was, Zen's rules are clear but his last trade was probably a mistake, which caused the confusion because of using the third candle high.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Im sorry for late reply. quite busy today. yeah , im sorry for any confusion, what i refer is 8 hour chart in ic market. and yeah you guys are right. right now forexfactory time is 2.30(which is 2 hours before london open is 2) and the ic market is 9.00.so it means 3 hours before london.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
thanks for the indi, and hope my explanation clarify the confusion.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
You are welcome Zen. I am still a bit confused because your rule 1 says we have to wait for candle to close (the second candle before London open, which is still forming when you placed a pending buy stop order at 1.0630. We still have one more hour before london opens. 1.Open the EURUSD Pair, then wait the last two candle before the london market open (i use icmarket, so its 8.00 candle time)hourly candle, wait until it close. 2.look at the highest and the lowest that the 8.00 candle made. [for you, now it would be highest and lowest of 9.00 candle which is still forming, few mins left to close. It's still two hours before LO, just different time]

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Good clarification. I've done some manual backtesting and the same method will work when using the 30 min candle on the US open at 1430 GMT. Use high low of that candle (1430-1500 GMT) and set same orders. Thing is SB firms have their people scour the forums for these methods; this could be easily wiped out with MM games as mentioned above! Good luck all

--- 帖子 #114 ---
you are right.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
actually i dont know. last month i checked the ic market and if im not wrong it is 8.00 and it exactly 2 hours before london open. But for now i think trade for the 3 hours before london open, because i refering on icmarket 1hr chart.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Buy stop triggered already. lets see how is the result.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
so we need to be carefully, if we do the backtesting, because of the timeshift!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thanks Zen for clearing that up. Now I feel confident enough to have a go at this system live.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
very good digiff, that's exactly the way I trade it

--- 帖子 #120 ---
yes same at my Broker, and now a little push up to the 1.0640 then it is done. it was already at 1.06392 so i decide to move my SL to BE +2 and go away, hope we all have a green Day!

That's the way trading goes. Come back to fight another day. All about trading the edge consistently! Could be due to FOMC this evening and lack of volume as people await the decision. MMs clearing out the stops either side.

Hi all, I understand the philo behind this method is to Profit from liquidity before it gets into the market. It sounds good. But experience teachs us that everything works and everything Fails. To me the method sounds plausible. Besides, Zen is sharing freely. I have just one big doubt. Martingaling the first trade just once it is ok in Terms of risk. The blindpoint I see is how to manage several days in a row with the method failing, and it will for sure. Martingaling the next days to compensate one day is in essence a Martingale. Martingale works most of the time quite well. But it only Needs one wrong sequence to blow out the account. It has no mercy at all that only one time. I see a lot of fear because of Banks seeing Limit orders as if they were able to move the market everyday just to catch 15 pips from some retailers. I am not denying it nor stateing the opposite. I just simply dont consider it as a trading factor. Why? because if Banks do so, you can easily track them. Then, by doing the same, you make easy Money . No way! If whoever of you take a look at how banksInvestment funds do, youll easily see that they are not that good. Many of them with annual negative Returns. Money is made from commisions!!!. To Banks, and other big Players, making Money in the markets is just as hard as it is to any of us. Exception made of following tje trading rules by their workers(Traders) which is easier for them than for us because of hierarchy structured power. My question is why to care about what other (Banks but also us-other retail traders) players do? My answer: Interiorise the wisdom of "trading in the Zone". (feel it, grasp it, melt it as part of your being..). If you fear the Banks, though they are not our friends to say it politely, then the battle is over. The market can only do 2 things (either your trade is right or it is wrong) and it cant always do it the same way. Thus, IMO it is vital to work with outcome distributions of a certain pattern or method, not only the pattern, method itself. Ive done extensive trading and Ive found out that in many many cases the Long term percentage of rights vs wrongs of a certain 1to1 method, system, pattern is funnily 50%. This is my case i know. Each of us is different, but what I observed is that the high probability trades come from trading the System, method, pattern AT the right time. To trade AT the right time means trading the method, System, pattern when the Odds are in favor of the method, System, pattern to work as it forecasts BUT also when the Odds are in favor that the method, System, pattern will fail. Thats why knowing the outcome Distribution is extremely important(to me). This is so according to what Ive experienced in 1to1. I am currently working on a pattern that Looks for 3to1. I wish it produced 50% LoL, but not. Funnily, as i feed the pattern with more and more fresh data (I dont backtest, I take the values in real time as days pass by) it seems that it tends to Show a 25% success. So, in the famous Long run, it does not give an edge either. However, I am finding the outcome Distribution to Show "Windows of opportunity" to catch a 50% in a 3to1. We can call it as we wish, but to me that is exactly when I want to trade. I am quite new to this way of perceiving the market. So Im still in the learning process. But promising results. I am currently working on finding a better MM technique to avoid martingales cause I use something similar to your method, Zentrader8, but applied to DAX (first candle with volume, most of the time the 1st hour). I know that if I apply Martingale everyday to my method it will be profitable almost every day. The big Problem as I mentioned before is those "almost days". Eg. Today the 2 orders of your method failed. Tomorrow you are gonna tripple the opening trade, if SL, you triple to compensate. If SL, then on Friday you triple the triple of triple..... if you know what a mean. I know it is weird to happen, but it is possible. As any other Martingale, it just Needs an occurrance to boom the account. I sadly know cause I did it a few times. I think I read you are Aware of. I will follow this method of yours from now on, as I am interested in simplifying trading. Maybe we can come out with an alternative to Martingale. At least, avoiding a pure Martingale. I am sorry for the "Testament" I just wrote hahaha .... particularly to be my first message in FF. Cheers

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Allthings Nice post. I get the sentiment and experience. I'm not sure Martingale Squared is the way to go either. I think Zen is saying that you only do this once in the day. So, as exampled today if you lost 1% on trade 1 and then lost 3% trade 2 you are down something like 3.4% overall for the day. Next day is a clean slate. You trade your 1% again. From my manual backtesting I can see that more often than not, the second trade (3%) gets you out of trouble. Days like today have been rare from the past 6 months of manual backtesting that I conducted. As I mentioned previously the system also works well on the 1430-1500GMT candle for the US open. Same rules but using a 30 min candle. As you can see from the attached chart from 2 Feb thru 3 Mar there was only one other day like today that didn't win. So a day with a 3.4% loss is soon recovered over the long run. The key, as the vertical lines show, that if Trade 1 fails, you MUST execute trade 2 to come back. Small sample I know, and I'm sure this could be backtested more systematically, but that's beyond my capabilities! It also shows that having to execute trade 2 is not common. There are 4 instances of Trade 2 being used here out of 14 trades, so it seems to work.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Yes, thanks and cheers to your first post. hope you can learn something here that can improve your trading or even your life. Yup. i agree that sometimes martiangle can work in most of the day. But it only need a consecutive losses(which can happen) to wipe all the pips you gain before. Thats why i suggest only trade martiangle for the day and the next day start from 1 lot again. Accept the loses, is accepting the winning. As long as we win in the long run. then we have an edge. As long as the statistical in our favour in the long run, then we can profit in the market. Trading is like flipping a coin , whether it is tail or head. By looking at the statistic we try to guess the outcome, but we never can predict it 100%. WE can be wrong, we can be right.IT maybe 50-50 . But i think if you found a method that can predict most of the trade, 70% (winrate) or above winrate is good enough. because trading is zero minus game. You have to pay commision and spread. so actually retailer trading was in losing position compare to others(banks,hedge fund, institution). A failed trade doesnt means that the strategy doesnt work, a failed trade is just a part of the system. and we have to accept it. But i am open to a better Money management if you have, you can share it here. Because i am also thinking and considering how to handle consecutive losses as well. Right now, im considering to open two lot on the second trade to minimize the risk. But if you have better MM and come with better idea, i am very open for it, we can discuss it to improve our trading.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Yes, thanks griwmweasel. i think you got my point already. But in this method if we lose, the first trade we lose approx 1.55 % and the second trade we will lose aprroximately 4,75% which means we loses around aprrox 6%. we do need consecutive wins with this kind of strategy, we need a high win rate. and i get the statistical data for last year, yeah we have a high win rate. But still.Im thinking how to improve the money management, Maybe you have better idea to improve the money mangement?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
today i wont be in front of the computer to post the chart when i do trade. Will post the chart later maybe in the night. Hope you all can trade profitly, and end the days with green pips.

Worked as planned this morning; Entry at 1.0720 Stop at 1.0735 TP at 1.0710 I have been using the 0600-0700 GMT candle and seems to work fine. The key is the liquidity and volumes around the UK/US opens. Ref the stops, I think your %s are wrong Zen. If I have a 5k account and I risk 1% then that equates to 50. Divide this by the SL (15) gives you pip size of 3.33. So if you lose then loss = 50. A win would mean a gain of 33.3. If you lose 1% then the next trade you have equity of 4950. Divide this new sum by 3% and you have 148.5 to trade @ 3% meaning 9.9 per pip. If that loses (as like yesterday) then total loss is 50+148.5 = 198.5 = Loss on day of 3.97%. Equity for next day would then be 4801.5. New 1% then equals 48.01/15(SL) = 3.201 per pip. TP win would then be x10 (32) - added to start balance =4833.This doesn't account for the usual bid/offer spread and slippage either! I think your aim on a loss day is to get out of the day at break even. Trying to still win by 3% would be sub-optimal over the long run. The martingale trade should only be risking 2% max IMHO. Maybe scaling in/out would be better? TP1 at 5 pips and TP2 at 10 pips. Stop trailed to BE once TP1 hit? Maybe the static TP @ 10 pips is too rigid? Maybe look at ATR and adjust depending on the 5 or 24 period volatility? Trying to shoot for more than ATR is sub optimal, so when ATR(24) is less than 10 pips then reduce TP and stop accordingly?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Sorry my fault. Then, it is ok. As you say, just accept losses and carry on having a life I fully agree with the rest of your post. I am having Trouble finding the exact candle of your method, but once I find it a will start dissecting the outcome Distribution so I could find some clues on how to apply MM. (These days I am not working hard as my father got cancer and he is in the last stage of the illness ) As a General idea to work with I am considering to define a sample period, let´s say a trading month, and increase trade size each sample period until you get the results you expect on a daily Basis. The increase step equals the trade size of the first period. In this case, 1 lot. Thus, the second period is a 2 lot. The third period is a 3 lot trade size, and so on. Eventually this is a Kind of a Martingale as well, but not squared (the ones I avoid) The idea behind is to catch, nobody knows where it is, the profitable sequence of the method. At the same time, keeping trading simple by trading one trade a day and complicating life to Banks in case they care of us That´s why the outcome Distribution is important to me to unveil. At least to have an idea of how the method has displayed its outcomes (in the past of course) One question Zen, when you talk of 70% or higher winrate, is it including the second trade? If not, 70% in a 1to1 is God, not good, God. If so, I guess as the sample increases you´ll find to face a funnily 75%.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Grimweasel, great work! I´ll follow your recommendation, in study mode, to the 30min candle. Just to know where to look at "1430-1500GMT candle" is the one usually US data is wired or is it the one when US stock markets open? Thanks There´s an old saying that states" four eyes see more than two"

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Yes, the US open candle. US opens at 0830. So 1430 GMT, but that might be 1330 at the moment due to daylight saving being out of sync. Basically, whatever the first 30min candle of the US equity markets opening is in your time zone!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
US Open - Same method but using the US opening first half hour. 30 min candle. Mark high/low. Orders at the next .00 levels above/below (OCO orders best). Open - 121.50 SL - 121.65 TP - 121.40 Hit TP. 2 successful trades today. Cheers Zen. Nice and simple.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi Grimweasel, nice trade. But are you sure you used the right NY open candle?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
NY Open is 9:30

--- 帖子 #135 ---
First buy stop SL touched, open second trade, TP. Ended the day with green pips.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Im sorry for your dad, and i hope all the best for him. Yes, i checked on the last year data, just found that this method hitrate is above 80% for the first and second trade. So you means that , random martiangle? Like today open 1 lot, then tomorrow 3 lot and the day after tomorrow 5 lot? then after that open 1 lot again, and repeat? so we loss and profit randomly , did you mean like this?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
looks like you using the wrong candle again, you took the candle 3 hours before London open as candle to mark high/low. If you had used the candle 2 hour before, you would have tp at the first trade

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Yup,your calculation is right. But what i usually use is i open 1% from the balance, means example if it is 1000. i just open 0.10 then if it wins it means i win 1% (minus commision) and if i lose is 1.55% and second trade usually i open 0.30 which means 3%(if i win) and if i lose is 4.5%(plus commision) Honestly i still prefer use 10 pips ,because its simplier, and its not so big either. sounds a little bit complicated to me if we have to use 5 pips, because we dont have difficulty in winning, we just have difficulty for losing streak.in fact if we use trailing stop to BE, many chances of profitable will end in BE only.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Btw,Nice trade today ! But is it the right time? because the eurjpy chart i think the time is not correct, i think its not the new york open. Please correct me if im wrong.

Sorry guys. My confusion trying to trade the US open from the UK with charting based in Cyprus (-2 GMT!) Because of US daylight saving currently if effect, US events happen 1hr earlier in UK time, until we also move our clocks forward on 26 March. There's an old maxim in the markets, that retail play the open and Pros own the close. If you look back at the US Cash Equity Open at 0830 US time, the first hour is usually mixed. I find the best time where trends gain traction is post the first hour; as someone said, there are well known strategies that trade the first hour. By waiting for another 30mins after the first hour we have a better chance of success - this is reflected in the price action. Have a look back at the M30 bars that close after the first hour. In effect, you are placing orders 1.5hrs after the cash equity open. Hope that clears up the confusion; thanks Zen. For those of you who wish to trade the US session (or any other for that matter) I have enclosed a useful indy for marking the 30min candles. You just need to play with the box colour(none) and choose your line colour then change the open/close times to adjust. Good trading

--- 帖子 #142 ---
i believe we've already established that Zen's system uses the 3rd candle before London open. It may be an idea if Zen would changes this in his first post with the rules in it, to prevent this ongoing confusion.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi Zen, No, i didnt mean that as that is exactly a martingale but instead of martingaling the trade, martingaling the day ... I guess it also works most of the times. Excuse me then ´cause I did not make myself clear in the first place. What I wanted to say is that I am trying to find a MM technique to feel confortable with that avoids martingale squared as I got a method similar to yours and I am trying to scape martingales to compensates losses. What I commented in my previous post is quite a modification of your method. Sorry for that, I didnt mean to evaluate your work, much less to change it. I just wanted to propose something that I have in my mind to improve the impact of "bad days". Somewhere I read that the first loss is the best loss. So, if I apply that, then only one trade per signal is the best option, meaning no 2nd trade according to your method. One trade with the parameters defined by the methodogy. That is, one day one trade! That is my starting point that I didnt make clear. Sorry The filosophy behind is that is easier to counterbalance a bad day than 6 (in case both trades went to be SL). It is something obvious, but I like this thread because of its title Thus, starting from that premise - one day, one trade - then the MM technique that I´m considering is as follows: Figures just to work as an example: Sample period : 10 days Starting trade size: 1 unit (whatever it might be that suits and fits each trader´s risk) Results: win, tie or loss If win or tie, keep on trading on 1 unit trade size. If loss, then increase volume to 2 units for next sample period. Results: win, tie, loss If win, then come back to original 1 unit (the value of that 1 unit should be a function of the equity balance) If tie, repeat volume for another sample period If loss, then increase volumen to 3 units for next sample period....... and so on until one become so **** old or runing out of patience and money just kidding, a bit of humour at this time of the morning can make any bad. I hope I made myself clearer this time on the MM I am considering Cheers! PS: I dont know if I did it right, but today it nicely worked with the 1st trade. I did it on real. So thanks again Zen

Zen, did you trade last Friday? how did that trade pan out for you?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
i tried trailing stop 10 pip sl 15 pip . 2 trade / day . don't triple lot when hit sl. If TP or SL hit wait untill price come to middle of 8.00 bar then start pending trade again. In 2.5 month(2015/01/05 to 2015/03/13) profit is 245.2 pip. DrawDown is -52.5 pip Most of the time this system will win less than 10 pip but if market 'boom' we win 20 - 40 pip . this system work in some market .I mean I often have loss day 3-4 day continue. This is why don't triple lot.I don't want big drawdown. just wait. this system need 2 big win and will recovery your loss day. loss day = (loss ,small win) or (loss,loss) i took trade 84 trade 27 loss (-15 pip) BE 3 win 54 win trade have ... 1-10 pip = 26 trade 11-20 pip = 14 trade 21-30 pip = 7 trade 31-40 pip = 7 trade I know my eng skill is bad.Sorry

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Nice work Kaimot I've stuck with the original plan by Zen but if I lose the first trade, I wait and trade (1 lot) with the m30 candle 1.5hrs after the US open. Works really well on EurJpy too - I can get 1 pip spread and the ATR on eurjpy is usually higher, so it moves longer/quicker. I agree on triple lots - too big, but with a 64% win/loss ratio on your sample, just opening again once a day with a single lot gets lowers your day loss ready for tomorrow. Both trades hit TP in eurjpy today.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Nice trades, hopes today trades have green pips as well

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Sorry for late reply, recently ive been quite busy. i notice the right candle should be 2 hours before the london open, not 3 hours.. so whatever your timeframe is, just wait 2 hours candle before london open, see the high and low and open the trade above or below. sorry for my mystake, because i just done some research, and the trade that give better yield is the trade i look at the candle 2 hours before the london open. Friday i ended with loss(because i still trade wrongly and look at the candle 3 hours before), but monday and tuesday i ended with profit.So it should be the 2 hours candle before london open.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hello kaimot. you did a nice research. May i know what kind of trailing stop do you use? and how is the method? and i want to ask, you did a test on january 2015-march 2015? why you did the test on that year? not this year 2017 or last year 2016? Is there some reason behind it?

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Yes, its just my mm. To minimize the risk i think we can open twice lot size on the second trade. Its better than triple lot. I saw the eurjpy chart, and i think it works well too. But for me the spread in eurjpy cannot get as low as eurusd. As for icmarkets sometimes the spread can be as low as zero.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
No nothing behind that. I just ramdom time. my method is Pending trade sl 15 on roundnumber trade hit 10pip move sl to BE and trailing stop 10 pip. If tp or sl hit wait price comeback to middle ((high roundnumber + low roundnumber)/2) then start pending 1 more trade . I'm waiting price come to middle because i avoide choppy price. If I have time I will try this in this year. sorry for change your system but I'm so greedy with some big move. haha

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Agree Zen. Pair with lowest 'criminal' spread is best. Works well with the 30m candle 1.5hrs after the US open too. I've found my losing trades are around strong number 00 levels, such as EurUsd today around the 1.800 level (traded US open). These big levels often present significant battle lines between the bears/bulls. Trading the 1.840 to 850 level for example should be easier? Would have to conduct some forward testing. Still, green pips today!

True, successful trading is really about simplicity. Yes it is simple, but it is certainly not easy. This "Might be" one of those simple and yet powerful methods, trying it out and getting the results would ultimately be the only way to remove the "Might be" words. Looking forward to testing it.

Current rule is: 1.Look at the candle 2 hours before london open, wait until it close. 2.see the high and low 3.Trade the next 00 level above and under. Its simple

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Under these rules were two totally unprofitable days -120 pips. It is unlikely that there would be more than 12 successful days.

Zen you can find several variations of GU or London breakout EA's i don't know are you re-inventing wheel, there are many varations of these, and easily found.

This must be one of the best breakout EA:s: Volceq from mastercoder xux99. https://qforex.ml

I've coded an ea for this strategy. I'm going to upload it after testing ends.

right, same I have this Trade. good job!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
@zentrader if high or low of the previous candle is 1.xx000 like 1.08600, then buystop or sellstop should be 1.08600 or next 00 point which is 1.08700 for buystop , 108500 for sellstop. Thanks in advance.

Hi Everyone, I am following this tread and reading your posts. I think it is really helpful but it still can be misleading. Let me sum up our rules for you to review and to modify if necessary. Zen Trader Method: Play major pair with low spread, most commonly EUR/USD Use 1H chart with marks at 00 levels Focus on market openings, most commonly London open (8:00 GMT) but you can also use NY Open, Tokyo Open etc... Two hours before market open (6:00 GMT) watch 1H candle and mark her HIGH and LOW, those are your reference points If next candle (7:00 GMT) breaks one of your reference points (HIGH or LOW from previous candle) you go this direction At the point next candle breaks one of your reference points you immediately put pending BUY (if it is HIGH direction) or SELL (if it is LOW direction) entry point is nearest 00 price level Take profit is 10 pip, Stop Loss is 15 pip If it is a success you finish for today If it is failure, you go the opposite direction in the next trade. So if you went SELL and lost, in next trade you go BUY (with the same Take profit is 10 pip, Stop Loss is 15 pip) but with bigger position Your ENTRY POINT in next trade is nearest 00 price level on the opposite side of candle at 7:00 GMT BUT... to be honest, reading more of this tread leads me to different conclusions, and different method: Zen Trader Method v2: Play major pair with low spread, most commonly EUR/USD Use 1H chart with marks at 00 levels Focus on market openings, most commonly London open (8:00 GMT) but you can also use NY Open, Tokyo Open etc... Two hours before market open (6:00 GMT) watch 1H candle and mark her HIGH and LOW, those are your reference points You mark closest 00 points above and below your reference points at the higher you put BUY STOP and the lower you put SELL STOP Whichever is trigged first you go this direction Take profit is 10 pip, Stop Loss is 15 pip If it is a success you finish for today If it is failure, you go the opposite direction in the next trade. So if you went SELL and lost, in next trade you go BUY (with the same Take profit is 10 pip, Stop Loss is 15 pip) but with bigger position Your ENTRY POINT in next trade is nearest 00 price level on the opposite side of candle at 7:00 GMT As zentrader8 is not fluent in english I encourage all of you to help add comments and evolve this thread. Thank you guys!

--- 帖子 #198 ---
thanks, it would be great if you can code the strategy into EA. It should be next 00 level, so if it is already touched at the 8(2 hours before london open candle) then we will trade the next 00 level.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Sorry, What is the different then?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
TOday trade. Ended in green pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I'd like to give an example to make it clear. Open, close, high and low values of the 8:00 candle are O : 1.08452 C: 1.08482 H: 1.08500 L : 1.08400 So as soon as 8:00 candle closes and new 9:00 candle starts, we should put a buystop order @ 1.08600 and a sellstop order @1.08300. Am i right?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Right now im testing new money management. Use only 13 SL, and open two trade . One take profit at 10 pips, and another one is BE when 10 pips reached. Let the second trade run. IF a trade fail, dont need to open a bigger lot, just open two trade like the first trade.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Yes you are right.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Thanks zen. Another example. O : 1.08452 C: 1.08482 H: 1.08499 L : 1.08401 So buystop @ 1.08500 , sellstop @ 1.08400

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Well... are you able to confirm points from this list you agree with and you think are good?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Yup you are right. as long as the 00 level still untouch, we trade the 00 level.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Can you share your template and 00 indicator in post 1?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Sorry i cant., because one of the senior member asked me to not share the indicator, maybe its violated some kind of copyright. but you can get the indicator on this link https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=203319 or this https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...09#post6857209

I attached the indicator but it seems nothing appears.

For anyone who wants to join icmarkets. you can use my link: https://icmarkets.com/?camp=9995 (you can get commissions deduction 1.50 $ /a lot ) Im sorry if i sound selling,but im just helping others to get cheaper commisions here. its okay if you dont want to use icmarkets. you can trade with others brokers as well. but make sure if you want to trade this method you have to use a broker which has small spread. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
In order to achieve 10 pips profit to 15 pips loss ratio , commission should be added to takeprofit and subtracted from stoploss. So actual takeprofit should be 10 + commission which is 10+0.7 = 10.7 pips for icmarkets and stoploss should be 15-0.7 = 14.3 pips.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Zen. I've been having success with opening two trades too. One in eurusd and one in eurjpy. If both lose, that's it for the day. If both win, again that's it for the day. If one loses and one wins (so down on morning) I then trade the US open but with eurjpy ONLY. From my visual backtesting, this pair trades more consistently in the UK PM / US AM session. I use the 1530-1600hrs UK summer time candle close on m30 chart then same method. 00 level above below that candle high. I'm not too fussed on the spread. As long as it's around 1 pip that's good enough for me. The strategy will still be profitable. The downside is that this 'market inefficiency' will end up being arbed away by the SB firms/robots etc if too many people start making money with it. These boards are scanned for this sort of thing. Make hay whilst the sun shines would be my advice!

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Does this EA auto trade and without the need to have 00 level indicator??

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I am enjoying this thread. My question is why on EARTH would a senior member ask someone to "not share" an indicator that has been around for YEARS??? It is not a secret. It is free all over this forum and others. I have had it for years, so am not asking for it...but for the "senior" to act like it is some copyrighted forex secret is a bit dramatic....

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I agree with you. Why should such senior to ask so and I am interested to find out who is the senior and the reason behind.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Talking for icmarkets, We're right now in 8:00 1 hour candle. This's the candle that we take high/low values. So as soon as this candle closes, and new 9:00 candle opens we put buy/sell stop orders. For ea users, TradingStartTime should be 09:00 for icmarkets. Change it according to your broker's mt4 server time.

thanks zentrader 3rd time this week i was going to give it a try and doubled my small account with bit more aggressive lot, my only concern if it work for long run cause 1 loss take back 1.5 win days and if you lose twice a for 1 day you finished brutality, thanks following your new search and improvments

--- 帖子 #224 ---
seem nice method, i will try it, thank bro i am a big fan of simple and da vinci too

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Is there anyone using ZenTraderEaV01? Are Buystop / Sellstop levels correct?

Thanks grandaevus for the EA, today i took the trade from the phone, and havent got the time to test the EA. Anyone took the trade with the EA today?

Today green pips. Easy pips today. Btw its already 8 consecutive wins day from last monday. its been a great week. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Right now im considering to not doing martiangle when we loses, only open the same lot, 2 trade, one with a fixed 10 TP, and the others is BE at 10, so you can let it run(normally i took 20-30 on this trade).

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hope we can trade effortlessly simple and profitable.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Thanks for the EA, I gave it a shot: it doesn't seem to look at the H/L of the bar but at the o/c? It would also be nice if it would set SL and TP right away at the pending (you never know...)

--- 帖子 #231 ---
TradingServerTime should be set to 1 hour before London open which is 6:00 gmt+00. Every broker have a different server time so it should be set accordingly. Ea calculates the next nearest 1.xx000 point automatically so there shouldn't be a problem. For setting Sl &amp; TP at pending orders, while coding the ea, I've decided to put Sl &amp; TP after a pending order turns into a market order. Negative/positive slippage is common in pending orders so it's better to set Tp &amp; Sl in accordance with actual order open price.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Ok, thanks. It does calculate the next 00 level but starting from the close, not from the H/L, so if the wick is on "the other side" you get the order 10 pips too high when selling. London open is 8:00 GMT ?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
London open should be 7:00 GMT+00. Please change your time zone to gmt @ forexfactory home page and check market open times.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I tried the EA, it doesnt take profit. So it wont take profit unless we manually input it? can you make it automated? because no point to use EA if we should manually input the stop loss and the take profit.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
It's indeed automated. When the last candle before london open starts, ea puts a buystop &amp; sellstop order. When price hits one of these pending orders, ea immediately deletes the other pending order and sets a stop loss and take profit in accordance with actual order open price.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
###ZenTraderEAV02 When the last candle before London open starts, ea puts a BuyStop &amp; SellStop order. When price hits one of these pending orders, ea immediately deletes the other pending order and sets a stop loss and take profit in accordance with actual order open price. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What's new in this version? Made some changes in the calculation of 1.xx000 levels. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TradingStartTime = 09:00 for icmarkets mt4 server time, (one hour before London open ) Commission = 0.7 pips for icmarkets (for non commission based accounts, should be 0) Leverage = 10 (for every 1,000$ account balance , ea opens 0.10 lot) (risk is only % 1.5 of of your account balance) MaxSpread = 0.5 pips (change it if your spread is higher) Use it only in 1H EURUSD Chart When you attach the Ea to a chart, TradingStartTime value should be higher than current 1H candle. So it should be placed before the last candle before London open begins. EA opens just one trade per day. If stop loss hits and you want to recover your loss by a triple lot size, you have to trade manually. TradingServerTime should be set to 1 hour before London open which is 6:00 gmt+00. Every broker have a different server time so it should be set accordingly. Please try this ea in demo account first.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
thank you for the grate EA. Could you programm the EA, that it takes the second martingale setup too? So we coild backtest if this strategy is really profitable over longterm. Thank you

--- 帖子 #238 ---
zen is trying another method. When he'll made up his mind, I'll be ready.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
sorry for noob question.what does thd meaning of BE?? thanks

--- 帖子 #240 ---
just downloaded the EA and test it, change the time to 4.00, and then watch the price, it just pass through the 00 level, without taking an order. maybe something is wrong?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
@Zen, When you attach the Ea to a chart, TradingStartTime value should be higher than current 1H candle. So it should be placed before the last candle before London open begins. I think, you put a lower value than the current one, so ea didn't open pending orders. Are you still in icmarkets? Current 1H candle time is right now 6:00 am. Please change the TradingStartTime = 07:00 and try once more As soon as 6:00 candle closes and 7:00 candle begins, Ea takes low /high prices of 6:00 candle, calculates 1.xx000 levels, and puts buy/sell stop orders. And Zen, your commission is 5.5 not 7. So please change your Commission = 0.55

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Current High /Low values of the 6:00 candle are High : 1.07522 Low : 1.07451 So if these values won't change, when 6:00 candle closes, and 7:00 candle begins, according to your strategy, ea will place a buystop order @ 1.07600 , and a sellstop order @ 1.07400. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
It's working Attached Image (click to enlarge) Zen , please don't forget the delete pending orders and change your TradingServerTime = 09:00 (for icmarkets only gmt+03)

Buystop @ 1.0760 Sellstop @ 1.0750 Buystop has been triggered. TP : 1.0770 SL : 1.0745

--- 帖子 #245 ---
buy stop @ 1.0760 TP at 1.0770 SL at 1.0747 open 2 trade, one at 10 take profit one at 10 pips Break even +1

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Yes its working already, thanks. But i notice for the tp it add the commision ? and also in this trade, you are taking 17 pips ? with 15 sl?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
In order to achieve 10 pips profit to 15 pips loss ratio , commission should be added to takeprofit and subtracted from stoploss. So actual takeprofit should be 10 + commission which is 10+0.7 = 10.7 pips for icmarkets and stoploss should be 15-0.7 = 14.3 pips. If you pay 7$ commission per 1 standard lot=100,000units , your trading lot size is 0.10 and you set Commission : 0 , your net profit would be 10-0.7 =9.30$ not 10$. And if you loose, your loss would be 15+0.7 = 15.7$ not 15$. And it's not 17 pips, it's 10.7 pips. 7$ commission is equal to 0.7 pips. (for EurUsd) You should set Commission parameter to 0.7 not 7. As far as i know you pay 5.5$ commission per 1 standard lot so your Commission parameter should be 0.55

--- 帖子 #248 ---
now it's sell order at 1.0750 to 1.0740

--- 帖子 #249 ---
SL

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Sell Stop Ended with profit

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Shouldn't be 1.0740 to 1.0730? Stoploss is at 1.0745 so next 1.xx000 level is 1.0740 Zen, could you please confirm the right sellstop level?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Do u mean sell stop at 00 levels under stoploss?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
i think sell stop order is at level 00 of the candle

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Absolutely, Otherwise you would open a short order while your long order is still running . But frankly i'm not sure so i'll wait for a confirmation from zen. Backtest shows that it's not a good idea to increase your lot size to recover your loss. In my opinion one trade per day would be enough. With leverage 10, you only risk 1.5% of your account balance. If you increase your lot size and loose again, your total loss would be 1.5 + 4.5 = 6% of your account balance. With a 10 pips to 15 pips win/loss ratio, you need 6 wins in a row to recover your loss. Probability of this case is (1/2)^6 = 1/ 64 = 1.56 %

--- 帖子 #255 ---
maybe u r right i'm waiting for confirmation from Zen too because it's my first trade by this system Thanks god

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Yes, the right sell stop would be at 1.0740 because the first order is buy stop, and the stop loss is under 1.0750 already. So the right one is 1.0740.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
so the Sell order is active now waiting for 1.0730 with SL 1.0755..right?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
yes, you are right.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I use One Cancels the Other (OCO)orders. ETXCapital in UK offers these. So as one is filled (ie long) the short would be cancelled.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Zentrader, thank you for sharing the Trading Idea. When you miss your 10 Pips in the first run, you trade the 2. for recovery with Tripple LotSize. I have 2 Suggestions: 1. Trade both Trade (second when possible) with same Size.... 2. When you hit the SL in the First Run, maybe in the second too, instead of Tribble the Lotsize, Tie the Losses to the next 5 Trades... What do you think about this ?. BR Donald

--- 帖子 #261 ---
There's an unwritten but a good phrase among gamblers. "Don't chase your losses on the same day" . I prefer " Don't chase your losses." Give time to a strategy to prove itself. Just run the ea in a demo account for 30-45 days, and look at the results. Time will show everything.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I notice on this site quite a lot of members seem to be lost where they're supposed to mark their first candle. It would be a great idea if the senior members could put their charts on For all to have a look at. Also, if they could show that period separation lines or or the midnight line, whichever you want to call it, Thank you Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I'm going to make some changes in the code. Instead of TradingStartTime, I'm deciding to use LondonSessionOpenTime. It's right now 7.00 gmt+00. Since all brokers don't use gmt+00, , you have to change it in accordance with your mt4 server time. Speaking for icmarkets , it's 10:00 (gmt+3) Ea will calculate the 1.xx000 points and place pendingorders at the right time for you.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
The crux of the strategy is about taking 10 pips from the market in the times of highest liquidity. Most UK based traders and brokers get to their desks circa 0530 and many that I have worked with/spoken to say that trading really starts en masse at around 0600 UK time. This strategy lets the stops/order get taken out from the day traders/early birds that morning and then trade with the money flows that day. so, in short, look for the highest volume/liquidity session; trade before your local equity market opening time. The biggest Eur sessions are UK and US open. If you live in Aus/Asia then adapt this strategy to your market and the local pairs - say, audjpy or audnzd but also with the lowest bid/offer spread. Trade .00 levels at high/low of candle that closes 1hr before the cash equity market is open. NB. Most of the daily FX volume takes place in the London session, with it being the main global financial centre (for now!)

--- 帖子 #265 ---
what do you mean by tie the losses to the next 5 trades? could you explain more clearly?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Nice then.. its a good phrase. But for the first trade, every month will has different result as for last year some month many first trade suceed, others month many second trade. so i think it would be nice if we can forward test maybe not only a month but in longer timeframe.

nice explanation

when you Lose 1.7 LOT with 15 Pips SL, then Calculate 1.7_LOT*15_PIP/10_PIP = 2,55 / 5_Trades = 0,51 LOT The next 5 Trades are 0.51 LOT Higher, then you Recover the Loss with smaller Drawdown. Make a Max LotSize for the next Trades until the Recovery is Over. Max LotSize not greater then double the inital Lotsize. (In this Case 3.4 Lot) BR Donald

Zen, What about moving stop loss to breakeven when price goes open price + 8 pips and then put a trailing stop = 1 pip.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Have i understood it right.. the candle that's about to start in 20 minutes, when that closes you take the 00 levels above and below it, place your pending orders and then just wait till one gets hit, remove the other, 15 pips stop loss, 10 pips tp.? easy as that? Only thing i havnt quite gotten - if SL is taken - are we supposed to look only for the other way to trade? Lets say our first pending was a buy order, sl taken - we're only looking for sells for our second? or is it again, buy pending above, sell pending below "00's"

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Next version will support BreakEven Backtests show that one trade per day + stop loss to breakeven @ 8 pips is very profitable.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Absolutely right. Current 1H candle will close within 3 minutes. As soon as it closes, you place a pending buy/sell stop above/below of the candle @ 1.xx000.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Very good question. +1

Buystop @ 1.06800 Sellstop @ 1.06700

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Buystop has been triggered. Because of slippage, actual open price is 1.06802. Commission is 0.7 pips (icmarkets) Ea puts TP @ 1.06909 (10 pips + commission) and SL @ 1.06659 (15 pips - commission) I'll move SL to BE @ 1.06889 (order opening price + commission + 8 pips)

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Same as me then.. and if this goes as and hit SL - we look for sell ONLY at 1.06600?.. or do we put a buy stop again at 1.06700? Sorry if i'm slow.. been up all night.. not proccessing clearly haha

--- 帖子 #278 ---
You place a triple lot size sellstop order below sl @ next 1.00xxx which is 1.06600. But i also don't know what to do, if price hits Sl and then go upwards again without triggering your sellstop order.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Have you back tested this? how many days have you tested?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
You're sure it's not another buy + sell stop at 000 levels? :O makes the most sense to me.. but idk! haha maybe we're out for the day :O!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hits 1.06889 move SL to breakeven = order open price + commission = 1.06809

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Price hits TP . Done for today.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Since this is trading the "Frankfurt momentum", maybe also applying a direct trailing stop so that if price goes to +7 pips, our SL would be at -8, then let pick up the +8 trailing stop with breakeven. On average out SL would be around -10 or so, less or no need for "recovery"...

--- 帖子 #284 ---
yes as easy as that

--- 帖子 #285 ---
yes , if it hit stop loss then the next trade would be 00 level again, if it go up then buy, so no need to only trade the opposite. now i open two trade , one at 10 pips Take profit, and the other one at 10 BE+1. and my Sl now only use 13 pips.

ended the day with green pips. This week only one day failed(yesterday).but second trade ended with profit as well. so this two weeks can count as 8 consecutive wins on the first trade.(from last monday-wednesday). and only one has second trade, which is yesterday. and today also only needs a trade to ended the day. Hope you all have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Can you add the feature to open the second trade as well? and first trade can you add to open two trade? so one can hit at 10 pips, the other one we let it run without risk.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Please do a backtest and also forward test.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
lol ) Thanks I know what the result will be

--- 帖子 #290 ---
For first trade, if you want to open a second order, please open another 1h eurusd chart, and run ea with a different magic number.

Zen, speaking for today. Long order has been triggered. Open price : 1.06800 TP : 1.06900 SL : 1.06650 If stop loss hits, we place a triple lot sellstop order @ 1.0660. What about the buystop order? Could you please confirm the right price for the buystop order? Thanks in advance.

May i ask what % gain you've been doing with this method since you started ? i'm happy for the 150$ this made me today haha! ty

What he meant is you do the same as with the first trade. buy order will be at 1.0670.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I'm not sure but what he meant is find the highest point that price reaches after your long order has been opened. Lets say, highest point is 1.06876. Then place a buystop order to the next 1.xx000 level. In my opinion, buystop order should be placed @ 1.06900. Looking for a confirmation from zen.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Using this method for Rags to riches might be something.. hmm.. :O! 5-6 wins in arow and you got like 10000% ROI

--- 帖子 #297 ---
For example today price, Open price : 1.06800 TP : 1.06900 SL : 1.06650 If stop loss hits, we place a triple lot sellstop order @ 1.0660. But if it didnt touch the sell stop at 1.0660, and go up to price 1.0680 again , we will take that trade again(buy stop there again).. Just remember second trade must still above or below the highest or low the candle 8(2 hours before london open)made.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
this case if highest point is 1.06876 then the buystop should be 1.0690. Hope this clear the confusion.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Youre welcome, just remember that the method itself doesnt always made you profit or lose. its money management and our mind management that made a good trader. a good trader trade for the long run, gambler trade for a trade or two. Trading is a long journey.

Good then

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi Zentrader, have you read my last Post ?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Yup, i saw it already, i think its too complicated to be done. and it is also only can be done if you open big enough trade, if you open small lot , or even below 0.1 lot. this cant be done. So i think it complicate the trade, lets try to make something easier, and also more profitable.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
From next Week, i trade this Strategy with my MM. I post the Results after 1 Month. Nice Weekend to all!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Just over 2 Weeks trading this now. Thanks Zen great system . High ROI. Up 17.4%. Win/Loss ratio of 72% over 39 trades taken. I'm trading x2 pairs, EurUsd and Eurjpy Both on candle close 2hrs before London open and same again 1.5hrs after the US open. If first trade loses then I re-enter the trade same rules as before using OCO order. I've only had this fail and end down on the day once. Trade the system, stick to the rules, don't get greedy and let the profits build. As an aside see below. Assuming a starting account of 5K and using 2% balance risked for each trade, using a 10pip limit order and 72% win ratio, as you can see, hypothetically, you could achieve 489K at week 52. Of course this analysis is very crude and assumes your broker would let you trade at 653 per pip, but it shows the power of compounding! (I've omitted weeks 4-46 to save space)

###ZenTraderEAV04 When the last candle before London opening starts, ea puts a BuyStop &amp; SellStop order. When price hits one of these pending orders, ea immediately deletes the other pending order and sets a stop loss and take profit in accordance with actual order open price. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What's new in this version? EA now supports moving StopLoss to BreakEven after X pips (Default = 8 pips) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- LondonSessionOpeningTime = 10:00 for icmarkets mt4 server time (gmt+3) Commission = 0.7 pips for icmarkets (for non commission based accounts, should be 0) Leverage = 10 (for every 1,000$ account balance , ea opens 0.10 lot) (risk is only % 1.5 of of your account balance) MaxSpread = 0.5 pips (change it if your spread is higher) *** Use it only in 1H EURUSD Chart *** EA opens just one trade per day. If stop loss hits and you want to recover your loss by a triple lot size, you have to trade manually. *** LondonSessionOpeningTime should be set to London opening time . It's 7.00 gmt+00. Since all brokers don't use gmt+00, you have to change it in accordance with your mt4 server time. Speaking for icmarkets , it's 10:00 (gmt+3) *** Please try this ea in demo account first.

Zen, in order to prevent misunderstanding, Could you please confirm the entry price levels of (second trade) recovery p ending buy/sell stop orders? Suppose, High / Low prices of 8:00 1H EurUSd Candle are (two hours before London opening) (icmarkets London Opening Time = 10:00 gmt +3) High : 1.08524 Low : 1.08443 Close : 1.08501 As soon as 8:00 candle closes and 9:00 candle starts we place buy/sell stop orders (1 hour before London opening) BuyStop @ 1.08600 SellStop @ 1.08400 Price moves upwards, triggers our pending buystop and a long order starts running Long Order Open Price : 1.08600 TP : 1.08700 SL : 1.08450 Price continues to move up, reaches 1.08684 , then returns back and hits our stoploss @ 1.08450 To recover our loss, we place buy/sell stop orders with triple lot size We place our second recovery b uy/sell s top orders @: BuyStop @ 1.08700 SellStop @ 1.08400 Am I doing this right?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Ofcourse, just if anyone have been doing this system for a while ~ what's their ROI ? gonna run 2 seperate accounts doing this, 1 with 100-200$, doing a modified version of rags to riches, and then trade normal on my other account just for a few weeks see how it pans out ! Thanks for the easy and somewhat exciting way of trading haha!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I check the time from middle of last year December to now end of March. December last half was very bad for this system! so the result is depend of your MM, in one case you loose half of your money and in the best case you win in this 3-1/2 Month all together 10% of your capital. if you start 1 January this Year with the best MM you can make 30% you hope if you trade at real account you choose the right time good luck to all, then we need it!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I try also in my office Calc file your MM, but the result is not better, is in the range! it is very important to choose the right time, end of year and holiday time may not so good.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I've made same backtests. Moving stop loss to breakeven after 8 pips makes great difference.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
The system relies on volume and volatility to work. Keep an eye on the VaR and ATR. If these are less than 10pips target then you may wish to alter the TP orn decide not to trade? https://www.oanda.com/forex-trading/...isk-calculator It's never a good idea to trade the Xmas period as vola is too low (see chart - ATR was barely 11 from 23-29 Dec). Most traders and therefore vola come back to desks in second week in Jan.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I'm sorry about this. But I'm getting confused when you say 9 o'clock is the London open, I am trading in Great Britain. So the clock on my wall tells me when London opens, And when I place my mouse over the candle. It tells me which candle, as just open. What makes it so confusing is my broker as two candles or two hours in front of me. So I count everything from the mid-night line. Could you just look at my chart and tell me if I have got this right. Thank you Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I didn't say 9 o'clock. I've said 10:00. 7:00 gmt+0 is the London Session Opening Time. icmarkets trading server time is gmt +3. So, speaking for icmarkets, 10:00 is the right time for LondonSessionOpeningTime.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Okay nice then happy weekend for you and everyone

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Thanks for the update In this case ,the second trade would be buy stop @ 1.0860 and sell stop @ 1.0840. Because the first it hit SL and the 00 pricle price above and below 8 candle is @1.0860 and @1.0840, so we still put it on the level.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Thanks for the calculation, im happy to see the calculation,i hope it can motivate all of us to trade consistenly and profitly.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Now , I've got it. Thank you very much.

Trading with ###ZenTraderEAV04, broker : icmarkets, trading server time : gmt+3 Current EurUsd 1H candle is 8:00 High, Low values of the candle are H: 1.06811 L : 1.06770 So if these values don't change, ea will open a buystop order @ 1.06900 and a sell stop order @ 1.06700 when next 9:00 candle starts.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Ea has placed pending orders @ Buystop : 1.06900 Sellstop : 1.06700

Sellstop has been triggered. A short order starts running. Ea has deleted buystop order and set tp &amp; sl values that are written below. Order open price : 1.06699 Tp : 1.06592 (order open price - 10 pips - commission) Sl : 1.06842(order open price + 15 pips - commission) Commission : 0.7 pips

--- 帖子 #324 ---
If price hits 1.06612 (order open price - 8 pips - commission) , ea will move stop loss to break even (order open price - commission = 1.06692)

Sellstop has been triggered. A short order starts running.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I keep asking the same question, just because so far i've never had to actually do it! if SL is hit at 1.06750, we place 2 new pending orders - 1 sell stop at 0700, 1 buy stop at 0800 right?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Yes, with triple lot size. But I prefer just 1 trade per day with breakeven @ 8 pips.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Ok! thanks for the answer! Have you checked, like back tested it with only 1 trade instead of a second one with triple your lot size.. what the different results are?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Yes, i did. 1 trade per day with stop loss to breakeven @ 8 pips is more profitable. With leverage 10, you only risk 1.5 of your account balance. If you take the second trade and loose again, your total loss would be 1.5 + 4.5 = 6 % of your account balance. In order to recover this loss, you need 6 consecutive wins in a row. Probability of this case is (1/2)^6 = 1/64 = 1.56%

--- 帖子 #335 ---
well.. i was taken out +1 "moved at +8".. see how it goes for the rest that's in the trade!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
You won't need the enter your commission in ea any more. Next ea version will automatically detect your commission , convert in to pips, and set your tp &amp; sl.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Still in the trade. Since i pay 7$ per 1 standard lot, my breakeven point is = 1.0660 - 8 pips - 0.7 pips = 1.06513 Price hit 1.06523 and returned back. Your trade shouldn't be closed out either. Are you trading manually or using ea?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
So you were 6 micro pips from hitting 8 pips haha! close one! "according to my broker" 7$ per 1 standard lot.. so 0.7 spread is what you're saying? damn.. should look at another broker :O! way to high haha!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
What is your broker? Mine is icmarkets. Max spread is 0.1 pips

--- 帖子 #340 ---
price has hit my breakout point @ 1.06513. Stopp loss has been moved to break even = order open price - commission = 1.06593. Tp @ 1.06493 = order open price - 10 pips - commission = 1.06493

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Ah, you pay a "comission" instead of a spread then or..? I use ActivTrades .. avg ~ 0.5 spread on EU I use them mostly because they got insanely good support, within 24h withdrawal and just feels.. safe? been around since 2001, regulated by the FCA "or whatever they're called".. best broker i've used so far "not trying to sell them to anyone.. just my honest opinion!"

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Yes you're right. If activetrades eurusd spread is 0.5 and you don't pay any commission, then it's cheaper than icmarkets In icmarkets eurusd spread is usually 0 or 0.1 but commission is 0.7 pips so your actual cost is 0.1 + 0.7 = 0.8 pips. But i prefer low spread ecn brokers. Because, a high spread has a high negative effect on your trades and your strategy.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Green pips for everyone! "except me.. or 1.. :'(" haha

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Closed out @ tp. Done for today.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Good job! the "higher" spread saved you from being stopped out at breakeven xD! sometimes it's a blessing! haha

--- 帖子 #346 ---
In fact, not higher but lower spread saved me from being stopped out at breakeven. Yours should not be stopped either. Are you trading this strategy manually or with an ea? If using ea, could you please send a screenshot of your external variable settings?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
today attached the EA at the chart , then on 9.00 the ea didnt open a trade, open a manual trade. sell stop @1.0660 TP@ 1.0650 open two trade, first trade TP already, second trade still in trade move SL to BE+1 But suddenly the EA open a trade on 1.0650 although the london session time already set at 10:00

--- 帖子 #348 ---
After price has triggered sellstop order and a short order has started to run, price has gone down hit 1.06523, moved up to order open price and then returned back made a new low and closed out @tp. Is your price feed different than 1.06523?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
if you want,you can use my referal link https://icmarkets.com/?camp=9995 to open the account in icmarkets, it will give you comission deduction from 7$/lot to 5.5$/lot. hope it can helps you to reduce the fee.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
What is your broker? Have you attached the ea before 9:00 or after 9:00?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
\ Nope its the same. i notice when it take profit on my manual trade, the EA open a trade on 10:37.Maybe its because of internet problem?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Zen you've attached the ea on 15 minutes time frame. It should be 1h. Never change the time frame while an ea is running. Open a seperate 1h chart. Attach the ea with default settings except commisssion. Change it to 0.55

--- 帖子 #353 ---
ah i see, so i should change it to 1h? it gives different when i attached to 15 m and 1 h?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Absolutely. Since your strategy says look the high / low of the candle that opens 2 HOUR before London opening , i wrote the code of ea to work on 1h chart.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Frankly, i've been deciding to change the platform and move to ctrader or mt5 from mt4

--- 帖子 #356 ---
i see. actually i prefer ctrader rather than mt5. if you use my link and open c-trader account, it also will give you commision deduction 8% on c-trader account. Hope it can helps you

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Manually.. once price hit xxx i moved it manually to +1, having 0.5~ spread stopped me out on the retracement then it went back down ;p but meh.. i'm happy anyhow.. seeing the "system" working! need to finetune it just! BTW Zen! where did you come up with the 10 pip TP and 15 pips SL? i mean.. why not 15-15, or 10-10 or whatever? why just those exact numbers?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Charts show bid prices. For short orders, you should use ask price. Please try the ea, it will do all these calculations.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I'm having a hard time trusting EA's xD but might be worth a shot since i'm not always awake at 7 ;p haha The h1 chart with the EA on it, i can't change my chart timeframe at all there? always needs to be at h1?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Yes, just open a seperate 1h chart, attach ea on this cart, change external variable settings if necessary. Most important setting is LondonSessionOpeningTime.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Is is my london open ? "09.00"? or my brokers?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Mt4 server time. Please read the post #305 @ page 16. I've explained in details how to find the right London open time.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
What is the time at your mt4 right now?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Yeah i got no problems finding my time or my brokers.. just which one to put in ;p! Sorry.. i'll reread it.. maybe you said it.. my bad! my MT4 is the same as my current time so 15:37 "GMT+1" London open at 09:00.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
In your case, LondonSessionOpeningTime = 09:00

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi grandaevus Just a quick question. should this EA open at what ever time I put in the box as long as I'm on the EUR /USD and the one hour chart.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Ea places buy/sell stop orders one hour before London open. So if you enter 10:00 here, ea opens buy/stop orders when 9:00 candle starts by taking the low/high of the 8:00 candle.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
actually no specific reason, i just try the number that fit me, and simplify things. before i trade with other strategy with 1:2 risk and reward, that means 10 for profit and 20 for sl, but it doesnt ended so well.. so i just try to look others number that works fine for me.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Ok, good to know haha! thanks again for showing a simple way to trade! adding it into my "portfolio" of other methods ! so far since seeing this thread it's been close to 100% accurate "not what i expect it to be forever" but really nice so far !

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Ur welcome, just remember that its not always strategy that makes you profit or lose.(more important is money management). If you win and earn on trading, i hope you can do charity or help others who are in need. Im giving this strategy free anyway(even it cost me a lot to know this strategy). This way we can contribute to human and help others who are in need and make this world a better place I hope we all live happily.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Always give something back! if it's by teaching others, giving away and helping those in need.. once you have enough yourself you should always look outwards! i strongly believe that's how you get to live a happy life!

EA always checks spread. If spread is higher than your default MaxSpread= 0.5 , no pending orders will be opened.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
LondonSessionOpeningTime = 10:00

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Timnyman94, Don't forget to change it to 09:00. And also check your EurUsd spread . It should be smaller than the value of MaxSpread (default 0.5)

--- 帖子 #407 ---
really thanks for your guidence..only two small questions 1. sendond chart which i have put,is he also a 4 digt broker? how to find 4 or 5 Digit broker ? 2. thank u , i will be waiting for your next EA which will support 4 digit.. thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #408 ---
MaxSpread=0.5 Can you give me some broker with this spread ? now i am trading in FXTM with spread for EU is 2 pip, very large for this method Thank bro

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Could you please write your current bid, ask price of EurUsd?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
yes, my current bid, ask price of EU is 1.06680 1.06699 spread is 1.9 pip

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Sorry I had to go out for an hour. What do you mean by this/ Your spread is higher than default. Change it to 0.9 how do you change your spread. I've no idea here is a picture of my settings for your EA. I'm sorry for wasting your time. I have been trading this system manually. But would like an EA just for backup and yours seems to be all singing and dancing just what I need. For when I cannot manually trade. This system. Thank you. https://i.gyazo.com/8b9dec91744828bf...d6b29a9c2c.png

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Eseguendo un backtest, dal momento che si può fare, i risultati non sembrano incoraggianti !. Io Mi sbaglio?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Your spread is too high. You can still use the ea by adjusting MaxSpread setting. For better spreads , check icmarkets, pepperstone , onetrade.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Ea external variable settings, MaxSpread = 0.5 (default value) Please read post #372 @ page 19. And current ea version is 05. strongly advised to use latest version.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
thank for your advice

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Today is a very good example to show the negative effect of high spread. EurUsd price has moved upwards, touched SL @ 1.0685 and continued to rise up till 1.06892 and returned back. If you took the second recovery trade, your buystop @ 1.06900 would be triggered if EurUsd spread was higher than 0.8.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
You're wellcome.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Ok! i'll give it a go for tomorrow then! Spread should have been lower.. but i just thougt that the "MaxSpread" was just so it adjusted the SL and TP to fit! 0.5 is the standard you have set, but mine is moving alot "avg spread is like 0.4" but higher / lower depending on time of day. So should i just safe, put it at 1.0? what happens to the trades then..? do i get 11 pips TP and 14 pips SL? And thanks for taking your time to help us monkeys who can't figure these things out by ourselves!

--- 帖子 #419 ---
when i backtest i have problem with stop level. who have 0 stoplevel can backtest this ea for me ?. I want to see the result . thank you

--- 帖子 #420 ---
MaxSpread is an insurance to protect trades from the negative effect of high spread. It won't change your tp &amp; sl.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
There is an other way to eliminate spread. Instead of opening buy/sell stop orders, ea can track bid price and when price touches one of your levels, ea open a market order. So this prevents unwanted entries caused by high spread.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
would it be possible to make an EA that did this. Thank you

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Yes, definitely.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
hi grandaevus.. i am posting two images of brokers with 4 digit and 5 digit..both showing a spread.But my 5 digit broker spread never came belo 1.4 .Now the question is can we tade when the spread is in between 1 - 2. thank u Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #425 ---
If it's an ecn broker, spread has to be lower than 0.3. If you don't pay commission, which means commission is included in the spread, maximum 0.8 is tolerable. An EurUsd spread which is higher than these values means just one thing. Your broker is trying to screw you.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
If it's an ecn broker, spread has to be lower than 0.3. (max 0.2) If you don't pay commission, which means commission is added to the spread, maximum 0.8 is tolerable. An EurUsd spread which is higher than these values means just one thing. Your broker is trying to screw you.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
i pay commision its cheaper than pay for spread

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I am not recomending to use this strategy if you have spread 1-2 on your broker. because this way you easily get lose or touch the SL.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
TOday is a lost day. open first and second trade, both trades lost today.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
eventhough its cheaper but with this strategy, and your big spread, you can easily touch SL means you can lose more than you get.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
thanks for your reply..

--- 帖子 #432 ---
hi zentrader... thanks for your reply,if possible can u post daily post your chart ....after gaining complete confidence will search and open a real account with a with a broker ,who has spread value of less than 1 for EURUSD. Is it possible to open a demo account of brokers who has spread of less than 1 and test this startergy.if so please suggest me thank u

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I find ActivTrades super good.. low spreads , fast withdrawals, been running since 2001, regulated, and 24/7 support. You can open a demo without a live account. They are based in the UK.

Hi Zen Yup loser day today but no big deal as system has delieverd a run of wins. To be expected. Could be tight market ahead of Fed Minutes at 2pm (US). The ATR had closed right into 11 this morning and I nearly didn't put the trades on because of this. Lesson for future maybe? Has anyone managed to backtest this system using Amibroker? www.TrueFx.com offers free tick data for those who can code Amibroker and are able to test. This would be useful as by changing the candle times we could target the best performing hour (as you know I trade the US using this system 1.5hrs after the equity open, so 1600 UK time candle close. EurUsd not great at this time, but Eurjpy performs much better, albeit with 1.1pip spread - offset by larger ATR.)

--- 帖子 #436 ---
US Session m30 EurJpy TP Hit. 1600 UK Summer Time candle.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I notice you recommend ACTIV TRADES . I'm thinking of changing my broker. I'm currently with ETX , the spread for EUR/USD is min 0.6 and average is 0.81. but Leverage is only 1.200, I have look at ACTIV site and noticed the spread was better AND the leverage WAS 1.400 I would like to know if you've open a real account. And now you've found them with withdrawals. And do they mind you scalping. I would appreciate any advice, thank you.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Zen, taking the second recovery trade with triple lot size is not a good idea. Now, you need 6 consecutive wins in a row . One trade per day is more than enough.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
hi zen....even with icetrader ,spread is showing from 1 to 1.5 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Actually for this kind of strategy i recomended a broker which has less than 0.5 pips , because sometimes if you use BE +1 at 8 pips even 0.1, or 0.2 pips do counts. it keeps you on the trade, if your trade is too big, then its easier to get kick out of trade. I myself use icmarkets. the spread for eurusd pair is 0 pips, sometimes 0.1 or 0.2 (mostly is 0 or 0.1 pips) which is very good. the leverage is bigger , can use 1:500 . so i think you can try to open the demo/real account. You can use this link to open the account. https://icmarkets.com/?camp=9995 (using the link will give you discount rate on the commision) Hope it can helps .

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Yes, i realize that it is quite dangerous. Right now i only use 1 lot for the second trade. Yesterday i only open 1 lot as well.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
can you scroll on the left side and look at the eurusd pair so i can see the spread? and can screenshot the left side on the eurusd pair? because right now in my icmarket account the spread is only 0.1 pips Attached Image

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I think we should further test more on ATR, if really ATR can filter us from the bad trade, we can add on this indicator to filter bad trade. Hope someone can use the amibroker to test it and post the result here.

Any problems with ea?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Working fine, thanks.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi grandaevus, Would appreciate if you could come out with the "stealth" version of your EA soon--no pending order will be placed but instead will place market order when bid price crosses the 00 level. Part of the reason is because my broker does not allow placing pending order too near to the current market price and the other reason is to obscure the broker from seeing where we place our pending orders. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Very good idea. Suppose, Two pending stop orders are placed @ BuyStop @ 1.06800 SellStop @ 1.06700 Sell (short) orders always use bid price for entries. (price that you see in charts). Buy (long) orders use ask price for entries. So speaking for our example, Price (bid price) goes up till 1.06795 and returns back. If spread is higher than 0.4, your pending buy stop order would be triggered since ask price is &gt;= 1.06800 Using bid price for entries eliminates this problem. But replacing pending orders with market orders is a big change so i need a confirmation from Zen since this is his strategy.

Any Amibroker coders willing to backtest this. That way we can add confidence that we have the best candle time, settings etc I have the code for Amibroker for this strategy; just I don't have amibroker or FX tick data for eurusd or eurjpy Rgds

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I've deleted the pending orders manually. Strategy depends on Berlin &amp; London open momentum. Two hours have passed and no pending orders have been triggered. Next ea version will support order expiration.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
I think it's the support and resistance level that the first hour candle creates that's important. If you look back at price action over the past 6m you will find there are often cases where the trade will take up to 8hrs to activate, some even overnight into the Asian session. By withdrawing orders I think you could be upsetting the win/loss ratio of the system. Just my opinion tho.

today ended with breakeven. yeah i agree with grimweasel.i think.it doesnt matter about time..

Yup. EurUsd hit TP. My eurjpy trade lost this morning so re-entered x2 pos size and this one just closed out at TP too. The key is waiting for price to come back inside the 'zone' created by your signal candle. I'll now trade eurjpy again in the US session, using the 1600 UK 30 min candle close.

Hey! Grandaevus pulled out EA, now version 6. Great. As long as I am not able to use this EA could any of you provide some back testing done on this strategy through MT4 . That would be important to set out accuracy of EA and strategy itself. Thanks guys!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Yeah i pm'd you! @Plainview may i ask why you're not doing the backtesting? it's accurate enough so far "3 weeks in of live trading it" all i'll say.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hey Timny, I am using jForex trading software. Do not use MT4 at all. About back testing: it is vital to see data, the more the better. 3 weeks are not enough to rate strategy. We would need like 3 years or more test on 'minute scale' running this strategy to see it's worth. So that's why there is Meta Trader 4 Backtesting - to give traders more data and to check not only profitability of strategy but also how EA is doing in different conditions. Anyone here done that?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Yeah i get why you do backtesting, and it's been done "by some.. but not on a 3 year scale" but just wanted to know why you did not do it! and now i know ! I know 3 weeks aint enough, but that's 3 weeks live and following this thread since the start off it and so far been a good 4-5 weeks!

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Either actual spread is higher than your MaxSpread or your broker's min allowed lot size is higher than your MinVolume. may be your broker does not allow placing pending order too close to the current market price or auto trading is disabled. Do you see a happy face smiley on your chart? Attached Image These are the main reasons than can block ea to place pending orders. First , increase MaxSpread = 2.0.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
my ladtop broken,cannot upload the chart from my ladtop.. today trade: buy stop @1.0620 sl @ 1.0607 sl hit. open second trade @1.0600 tp @ 1.0590 sl @ 1.0613 lets see..

Daily down trend begins to loose it's momentum and show weakness. If it comes down to 1.0590 level, i'll start to buy .

--- 帖子 #495 ---
For those who want to make a backtest, This strategy is time dependent. London Session opening time changes twice a year because of day light savings. If you don't change time in accordance with day light savings, , backtests will give wrong results.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Zen, we're on the same train. Your TP is @ 1.05900, my buylimit is @ 1.05910

I have a long order bought @1.05910. May the price continues to move up. Today's stop order levels are BuyStop @ 1.06800 SellStop @ 1.06600

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I've made a backtest. If pending orders are triggered before London open, probability to hit your take profit increases, if triggered after London open, probability to hit your stop loss increases. So, I'm deciding to add PendingOrdersLifeSpan = 1 (unit is bars) setting in next version.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
So, if one of the pending orders won't be triggered till the end of this current 1h candle, I will delete the pending orders manually.

i taken it manualy tomorrow i will try the EA

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hey, Good for you! Since you spread EA around here may be you can present the reports. What is the probability of this strategy and/or EA in your tests? This is the way to determine a what is the true edge of any given strategy, not only this one, but in general. This thread called "Simplicity..." should be simple: 1. we have strategy, 2. there is EA, 3. there are some results in percentage which one can base it's decision on. Anything above 60% is a success. Best!

--- 帖子 #524 ---
A very good point. A strategy can only be called a strategy if and only if it has rules that can be turned into codes. You can't thrust a strategy that can only be traded manually because it's win/loss ratio can never be determined.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Speaking for the original strategy written @ post #1 by Zen, Zen says, if first order result is a loss, then open a second order with tripple lot size, But Ea only opens one trade per day. If stop loss hits, second order won't be opened. I did not put this second trade rule into ea, because in my opinion, losses should not be chased. And backtests prove my opinion. Original strategy says, place pending orders @Berlin open (1 hour before London open) and wait for the price to trigger one of your buy/sell stop orders. But backtests show that, if pending orders are not triggered before London session , probability of hitting your SL highly increases. Since I'm still working on to find perfect settings, please give me some time to publish backtest results.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Great stuff Grandaevus I think with the variables added and robustly backtested then it will decide the strategy. Like you said tho, BST changes every 6 months so may have to run a batch of 6m back tests and aggregate the results. I've found from my own forward testing that eurusd works well in the AM session and eurjpy in the pm (1600 BST close 30m candle).

--- 帖子 #527 ---
today trade ended with green pips. waiting to hear some back.test results from you. . Hope we can optimize it more.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Of my quick analysis of 104 trades trading this method: Losers 40 Winners 60 Of the losing trades 24, (60%) lost outside of the 1st hour (so after 0800 London time) Of the winning trades 36 (60%), also won after the first hour (so after 0800) So inconclusive cancelling trades after the first hour. Fewer would lose, but then fewer would win either. Net profit (loss) trading EurJpy - h1 and m30 at 0700 and 1600 respectively = +4% Net profit (loss) trading EurUsd h1 and m30 at 0700 and 1600 respectively = +0.32% EurUsd trades that activated PM - 22 that generated -5.9%. AM trades generated +6.2% EurJpy trades that activated PM - 27 that generated +10%. AM trades generated -5.7% For me the analysis is clear; trade only eurusd in the AM session (0700 H1 candle close) but leave candles to run until 1600. After this cancel any order. trade only eurjpy in the PM session (1600hrs m30 candle close) orders to run until 2100 (NY close) and cancel after this. Always worth logging all trades to allow for such analysis! Happy Easter folks. Remember to refresh your soul/minds away from the computers.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Number of losses : 40 Number of wins : 60 Now some maths 40 x15 (Sl) = 600 pips loss 60 x 10(Tp) = 600 pips gain Net profit/loss = 600 -600 = 0 Your results are parallel with my backtest results.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
today big spread because eastern, no trade for me. Happy Easter folks

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Indeed. Same hymn sheet and all that. Now we have to work out how to refine by using past results. It might be that we have to accept a 10pip SL instead of 15? Maybe a trailing 10 SL??

--- 帖子 #532 ---
what kind of backtest method did you use? and can you give me.the excel result?maybe i can look at the data and tweek it.. as for now i use 13 pips stop loss and not 15 pips anymore..on the second.trade onlly use 1 lot as well..not triple lot anymore..

--- 帖子 #533 ---
friday the spread is too big,no trade for friday..

--- 帖子 #534 ---
happy easter for everyone who celebrate it.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
what kind of backtest method did you use?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Not backtesting Zen. This has been live forward testing. I diarise all trades each day and then use Excel pivot table functionality to assess variables such as time, pair, SL, TP etc. If you only put the second trade on at x1 then you will only regain 50% of the earlier loss. If the current strategy breaks even 40 losses/60 wins but the losses are 50% bigger then we don't have a winning strategy. The key is to backtest the strategy but this is difficult as it requires lots of tick data for eurusd to fully assess viability. It might be that a different candle time is better or a different SL strategy is superior. Oddly, it could be that by INCREASING the SL to 20 that the strategy has a better win rate. Yes, the 20 pips would take a lot of profit but how often does is it hit? Initial eyeball of charts shows me rarely - but the market will often activate trades and then come back 16-18 pips before falling away again for a profit on the original TP. It could be (just hypothesising here) that if we add a 24 period moving average(24hrs) that we use this as a trade filter and only set orders in concert with that (so if prices are below, short only and if prices above long only). Again, having the basics set within a reliable back testing regime would allow us to try these variables one at a time so as to identify the best method. Of course, we could over optimise, but we need to select a few main things which are: Best time frame(it might be H1 or M30 for example) Best candle time (could be 0630-0700 or 0600-0700) Best SL strategy inc trailing and closing half at TP etc Addition of a trend filter to limit fakeouts (24 period EMA) Addition of ATR filter (ie if ATR &lt; TP then no trade) Maybe would could open trades at 2% account balance but open 2 trades - one at 1.5% original rules with 0.5% same entry, same stop but 3xATR target (or trailing SL at 'x' pips) so that any trend trades can be captured. Backtesting in MT4 is beset with issues. What we need is an AmiBroker coder (or Python) with 1/2 years worth of eurusd tick data to be able to test the variables. I think the system is nearly there - but needs refining to make fully profitable but all within the confines of keeping the strategy as simple as possible!

Pivot table insights Eurusd and Eurjpy trade direction results. 1 is long, 2 is short. Note, winning trades have been 2 (short) which funnily is the same direction as the daily trend (see chart).

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Time Frame Analysis: H1 (so morning session) only profitable for EurUsd. More profitable LONG m30 (so pm session) only profitable for EurJpy. More profitable SHORT Funnily, this analysis matches the daily or 24 hr trend. EurJpy has been trending down on the daily since review period started.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Initial rough lookback suggests the addition of a 24 period (1day) EMA would act as a useful trend filter: Price &gt; ema. Only set log orders Price &lt; ema. Only set short orders Price straddles ema(ie ema runs through your signal candle) set buy/sell OCO orders as trend is flat and price could go either way I'm going to start applying the above filter rule moving forward. By backtesting open and close times we might also add the Good till function that cancels the trade if it hasn't activated in the first 2 hrs. The market flattens off around 1030-1100 UK time as the initial moves have gone and liquidity retruns around 1300 as US traders are getting to their desks. In my opinion you wouldn't want to leave trades in the market after 1100; the US session will often 'fade' the European session.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Interesting result from Pair/TF and Pip Value Clearly shows that whenever second trade is activated it often loses ( as the £10 and £15 columns show). The better strategy might be to walk away for day if Trade 1 loses. (I never tripled pip value, only doubled if 1st trade lost)

--- 帖子 #514 ---
So from this quick pivot table analysis I can offer some refinements to the system: For me as I trade EurJpy in PM session. A top level filter can also be added - No trades is broker bid/offer spread is &gt; 1 pip. Eurusd As per original system. 10 pip TP, 15 pip SL (until further tests show a better SL strategy based on previous results) Only set orders in relation to prices and the 24ema (as noted above) No second trade Only trade this pair in AM session, 0700 UK time H1 candle close Only trade is ATR &gt; 10 pip TP Orders GTC for 3 hrs (so cancelled after 1000 UK time) EurJpy As above for entry/exit rules As above for ema rules(but using a 48ema (24x2)) No second trade Only trade this pair in the PM session, 1600 UK time candle close Same ATR rule as above Orders GTC for 3 hrs (so canx after 1900 UK time) Let's keep the discourse going and see if we can refine for profitability

Yes, it was a nice trade today, keep it simple is the key. And Don't be greedy. The only way we can be hit is when it goes up and then goes back down again straightaway, Or it goes down and go backup straightaway. If only there was some way we could guard against this. I read somewhere that when the traders get in the office first thing in the morning they get rid of everything from yesterday, I think this is what causes the Spike.

I also bought a sell stop which I cancel, if you look at my picture you can see the winning trade. And you can also see how my stoploss was moved to break even. I was never going to lose any money.

this week,4 wins one lose.a good week this week.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Am I running the numbers wrong.....this very bad 80% winners and you loser - 2.86%......if risk is 1% @ 15 pips ....10 pips of profit= 8.3% of 1% or .0083% X 8 = total 6.64% profit ..2 losers@ 4.75% = 9.5% Loss.....-6.64= -2.86% the risk of 15 to make 10 does not work ... 000 entry rule is equally not sound..so if you are 2 below 000 we will move 8 pips to enter.. requiring 18 pips to be safe I don't think so.....the money management is the worst I have every seen 80% win rate and you lose ????... this is a great system....I will trial it and it looks very good....rule 1 is good limit your loses 15 pips .. in my testing the martingales were the losers ....how to make this a fantastic system.....1//.entry point nearest 000 or 050.....so if you 2 pips below 000 the sell would enter after 3 pips @050.....2// NO MARTINGALE.... 3//// you must let your winner run or it is impossible to win! what to do.... split the 1% entry in half so 2 X 1/2% entries... TP 1 = +10 pips...move stop on 2nd entry to -5....if you get stopped out you break even or a small profit .....if you move the stop to the entry point how many times you seen market come back and take your profit.....if you going to break even why not give the trade every chance of success.. this way the 2 losers= -2% the other 8 even if 4 stopped out break even 4 trades run ... happy days conservatively one @ 20 pips one @ 30 one @ 50 one @ 80 ....4 X 1/2% = 2% that covers the loses then 20+30+50+80 =170 pips ... every 10 pips = 1/2% ...17 X 1/2% = 8.5% ... 8.5% every 10 trades WOW .. a lot of trades run and run 15 to 20% per month is possible....I will test it this way and report back ... looks like a great simple approach ....of course in my analysis none of the martingale were winners but even is 2 martingales were winners you would only break even ......break even = a waste of time...

My sell activated today and lost by 0.7 pip. Shows the value of having the lowest bid/offer spread possible

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Wallaby- I concur. Needs more work as I'm not comfortable with a R/R of 0.75% either, as you point out the long run could be negative. This would be the benefit of having coded into Amibroker or PRT to enable playing with the variables to fine tune. Entry and TP are sound. It's the money management and SL strategy that needs the work IMHO

--- 帖子 #574 ---
I trail the SL at a constant 15 pips and BE at 8. The average SL hovers around 10 that way. There must be a better way I'm shure.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
yep I agree - poor R:R and MM can turn the best strategy into a loss and a good MM can turn a marginal strategy into a winner...add the correct Psyche and..........!!!!

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Ok, the key is the Volatility of the pair (expressed by the ATR). There is little point having a stop loss inside the period ATR. You'll get hit too often. I have just manually back tested EurUsd from 30 Jan to 17 Apr. I have some minor changes to the way I now trade. I use a 24 period moving (1 day on an H1 chart) average as trend filter. Buy only if price above. Sell only if price below. If the 0600-0700 candle touches the ema - then apply the normal Zen rules but with 1x ATR stop and 10 pip target. If price &gt; ema then disregard the .00 level above your signal candle. Look for the highest candle high of the day (starting at 0001hrs) and place buy order 1 pip above that candle high. This now looks for the trend to continue and fill our larger TP. 1xATR stop with a 1.5xATR TP. (so today the 24ATR is 13 pips. So 13 pip stop and 20 pip (rounded up) TP. This way winners will always be greater than losing trades. Cancel order by 0600 next day if not filled. If price &lt; ema then reverse of above. Look for lowest low of that day (starting at 0001hrs) and place sell orders 1 pip below that candle low. 1xATR stop and 1.5xATR TP. Cancel order by 0600 next day if not filled. Looking back at the period mentioned this yielded the following results: Wins - 38 Losses - 14 No trades - 7 Assuming a 5K account and 2% per trade means start of 100 risk per trade. Divide this 100 by your ATR to arrive at per pip. In this case ATR today was 13 pips. So 100/13 = 7.69 so rounded down to 7.50 per pip (for max 100 loss). So 13 ATR x 1.5 = 19.5 so round up to 20. 20x7.50 = 150. So max loss 100, max gain 150. We are now hoping to win greater than losses. 38x150 = 5700 14x-100 =1400 Profit =4300. Not bad for 2 and a half months' work. And this assumes that you don't increase the 2% in line with growing balance, so just static 100 risk, 150 profit. 86% Gain. Not to be sniffed at. I then did the same for EurJpy, M30 candle close at 1600 UK time (so 1530-1600 candle) Same rules as above. 26 winners, 16 losers and 17 no trades. Profit of 2300 Add that to the 4300 gives you 6600. 132% gain . No more than x2 trades per day. No martingales. Some day no trades at all. See example chart below of EurUsd for random period in past 2 months. Now, this was a manual eyeball test and there could be a few errors either side of the wins/losses, so if someone is good at coding maybe they could test these rules on a larger data sample for stability and validity? Have a good weekend folks

--- 帖子 #577 ---
1) If the 0600-0700 candle touches the ema - then apply the normal Zen rules but with 1x ATR stop and 10 pip target. Is this the candle before Frankfurt Open? Touches the ema means high or low of the candle touches ema?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Yes, if the ema bisects or any part (wick/body) is in contact with EMA then trade normal Zen rules. It's your signal candle, ie the 0600-0700 for me, 1hr prior to cash equity open.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Thanks, Look for the highest candle high of the day (starting at 0001hrs) and place buy order 1 pip above that candle high. This value differs from broker to broker. My broker 's server time is gmt +3. I place pending orders at 9:00. So I have to look for 9 H1 bars to find highest high / lowest low but for an other trader whom broker's server time is gmt + 0 , it would be 6 bars. Wouldn't be better to update the rule to "look for 12 bars highest high/lowest low before Frankfurt open"?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
It could be and I guess time zone might make a difference. You might want to use the last high in terms of an uptrend or last low for down trend. The idea is that we want trend continuation and this only takes place when each higher high and higher low are exceeded in an uptrend. Brian Marber has an excellent book on technical trading. For a trend to exist you need a rule of 4. A low, a high, a higher low and a higher high. Only after this sequence should you draw a new trend line. In essence I think you need to do whatever you like for your rules to define a trend. For me, that means above/below the EMA and a second check that the last high or last low (for short) is also broken. You could also use a shorter ema (say the 12) as a ribbon. You could use a 24 CCI. Above 0 line is bull trend and below 0 line is bear. I mark the +200 and -200 levels on a CCI as this is useful for short term momentum exhaustion. If price &gt; ema and CCI(24) is above 0 BUT BELOW +200 level then buy. If greater than +200 then it could be overbought. In essence, do whatever you are comfortable with to define a trend

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hey Grandaevus Is it possible to add the ATR stop strategy to the EA? User defined too enabling differing ATRs to be tested for TP. 24period ATR best? Not sure if break of HH or LL in past 24hrs also possible to code? Thanks in advance!

Super stuff Grandaevus -let's see how it performs in demo tomorrow. I note than when I run backtest in MT4 it doesn't show any data tho and reports an 'order send error' - Usually it will show something (cognisant of how poor the MT4 BT function is!)

I've been looking at another thread and they've been using a currency metre, They say they've been getting good results, they say when the euro pairs are grouped together at the top of the currency meter it a buy trade, or grouped together at the bottom of the currency meter it's a sell trade, I'm just wondering if this would give us a good indication whether to trade EUR/USD, and also whether to stay out of it. I will be running the currency meter tomorrow on my chart just to see how they line up and whether I get a good indication or not.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hi RedFan I've seen the same. Good point. To me, it could be that we use that meter and look for EURXXX pairs to be either bottom or top, but grouped too. One could make a case for looking to see if the strategy works on Cable, USDYEN and AUDUSD too- as these mostly have spreads under or at 1pip. So if EUR pairs are in middle of table then trade the gbpxxx pairs for example if they are the 'lead' currency?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
THanks grandaevus. i just downloaded it. For the rule1 TP and rule 1SLATR what we should fill in ? if we want to take profit just 1.5x on atr and sl 1x on atr. and rule two is not depends on candle 8.00 ? it is based on highest /lowest candle on that day?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
TP and/or SL pips always overrides over ATRTP/SL. So for 1.5x atr take profit Rule1TP=0 and Rule1ATRTP = 1.5. And for 1.0 atr stop loss Rule1SL = 0 and Rule1ATRSL = 1.0

No trade today. Euro gapped up and ATR doubled. Gap will probably be filled in US session tho.

If your actual spread is higher than that value, then ea doesn't place pending orders. Increase to 1.00 or 2.00

I am a little bit confused. Are still valid the rules highlighted in post 1 or not?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I just ran a manual backtest on EurJpy PM session using the NEW rules and the Original Zen rules(so disregard MA, use .00 levels but use ATR stop and ATR TP) The new rules- 24 wins, 13 losers, and 22 no trades. Net profit = £2300 Original rules but with ATR SL and TP - 30 wins, 28 losses, 1 no trade. Net profit = £1700 This means the new rules (if you wish to adopt them) were 35% more profitable over the time period (31 Jan-21 Apr). It takes quite some time to plug this manually into excel - must be an easier, more efficient way using Python etc. Wish I was any good at coding. Sigh.

Hi Grandaevus, Currently running the ver8 of your EA. Just to confirm, if Rule 2 trade is activated, the SL level will be managed by the EA or what? Because I saw the SL level has gone after the Buy Stop order is filled. The TP level is still there.

Hi Grandaevus, Today, Rule 2 buy stop order was filled. Besides the SL level not shown in the order after it was filled (using 1ATRSL btw), the breakeven was not moved to BE level after a specified pips movement (say 8pips) in our favor. Just wonder, it is designed like this (meaning to say the robot will take care of the SL level and BE level without showing to us or is this a bug?) Thanks!

Thanks Sir. Is this why I could be getting Error 130 all the time? Is this related to the magic number? When I run the backtest in MT4 it starts off for a few trades then hangs with Error 130 Order Send error. Is this Broker related to stop min distance or order min difference (ie Price +3)

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Dear Grimweasel, just an enquiry regarding eurjpy trading system. The signal candel is the 30min. candle from 15.30 to 16.00 UK time. Normally at this time, or 1 h hour later at 17.00, does happen a change of the trend of the market, so that, if the trading has been going up, it reverses back to down and viceversa or it looses its steam. In spite of this, do you suggest to follow the same rule, that is to consider the 24 period SMA and trading only accordingly?

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I'm just trailing the 1600 candle close as the US open is often faded as the 1hr candle extremes due to many historic trading methods using the opening hour. I read a report on ZeroHedge recently that pointed to nearly all of US equity trading taking place in the last hour (2000-2100 UK time as NY is GMT +5). Maybe we look at a different candle around that time as it may give better chances of trend/TP being hit? If using the M30 chart then you need a 48period ema -(24 H1 periods divided by 2). Of course the actual ema setting is arbitrary. I use 24 on H1 as it makes sense. It's the one day trend. You might want to use the H4 20ema (Time frame above)(120ema). Basically we need to steer clear of the SIN of over optimization; it's a killer. In keeping with Zen's original thesis and this thread, we need to keep things as simple as possible. All we have done is adapted the money management to something sensible. ATR. You could use standard deviation. You could use VaR from Oanda . Your choice. We have also added a trend filter to try and stay on the right side of momentum and give us a better chance of hitting TP.

26 April 2017 Buy Order 1.0950 (Triggered) Sell Order 1.0940 TP 1.0960 SL 1.0935 (Hit)

--- 帖子 #615 ---
yesterday used the zentrader8 ea, the results is positive. today open.manual trade @ 1.0950 and sl hit @1.0937. done for today. i notice today the high 1.0950 was yesterday high,and its the resistance area.maybe thats why price didnt go up and straightly go down.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Thanks Zen. This is the reason in the EA for showing previous 12h high. As price was above the ema one would only set a buy stop order. The previous 12h would be the one needed to be exceeded if the trend was to continue. I had my buy at 1.0952 which was never hit. The same as 24 Apr. The prev 12h high was never exceeded so no trade. 25 Apr was a green pip day as last 12h high was also that day's signal candle. Again, buy order only above that candle, which hit TP.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Thanks grimweasel, now i see the point . i hope with this filter we can filter the loses more.and get into only the right trade. Now im testing the EA with two broker, one is tickmill , and one is icmarkets. the settings is the same. The results is different though, even the chart looks the same. Today icmarkets broker trigger the buystop @1.0951, and ended with lose. The tickmill broker didnt trigger the buystop though.The highest on tickmill is 1.09504 the buy stop is a @ 1.09509. different brokers can lead to different result.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
You can change the last high look back. I mentioned 12hr but looking at past charts, what we are really looking for is the last low/high swing. I tend to trade above/below that on the H1 I think 24hrs could be sensible.

The 15.30-16.00 eurjpy candle touched the 48ema, so I traded the Zen way with SL at 1 ATR but I got two losses.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
See attached. Should have not lost twice either as 'we' (rather I) no longer advocate taking a second trade - the ATR money management negates the need for a second trade if the first loses. You need to set orders above/below the last H1 swing (marked). So long only above that for trend resumption.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hey Grim - can you post yr ea settings for the 2 different pairs please....ie - 1H EURUSD and M30 EURJPY ?? Cheers

--- 帖子 #623 ---
If I understand rightly, the Zen method considered also that the second attempt could happen in the opposite direction (sell/buy), with regards to the first. This gives a different chance of success, quite behind the advantage of using ATR as stop.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
I think anyway that this method has a lot of potential but needs a clarification of the rules and to be applied consistently over time

--- 帖子 #625 ---
today test the zentrader8 ea with icmarkets and tickmill , the tickmill open sell stop @1.0890 and its not triggered, and then icmarkets, it open the buy stop @1.0922, and its not triggered either. Both ended with the different order, but both ended with no trades, i realize it just open a trade, whether its a sell stop or a buy stop, it didnt open two stop, its only open one. and if it didnt triggered after 6 candles it will cancel. Today use the manual trade, open buy stop @ 1.0910 and tp @ 1.0920, it ended with profit. i open two order, one is using 1.5 x atr for take profit, with 13 stop loss, and one is only 10 tp with 13 sl. one is profit, and the one with atr ended with loss.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
the system still needs modification to optimize it. So still needs time to perfect and forward test it. But so far so good, i use the sl 13 and tp 10, mostly it hit 10 pips.Like today, if you use original method, you will ended with green pips, but if you use atr as TP point it will ended with loses. still need to filter the bad trade.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Right now we only open the first trade, and we didnt open the second trade, and also without martiangle. just simply open the first trade, and accept it whatever the results is.trade again the next day.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Two losses today: with eurusd following 1h candle at 7.00 am UK time and with eurjpy following 30min candle at 4pm UK time

--- 帖子 #629 ---
I'm going to code a new ea that will use Market Orders instead pending stop orders . High spread won't trigger BuysTop orders anymore.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Todays trade should have been normal Zen rules but with ATR stop. Rule 1 is always ATR stop and 10 pip TP. Only use this rule when signal candle touches the ema If above/below ema - we use ATR stop AND ATR TP, but only above/below the last H1 swing high/low. Simples So, today ended with a profit. 1xATR stop and 10 pip TP. Hope that clears any confusion. This is how I backtested to achieve the prev posted results.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Today again in the morning green pips with Zen rule, no trade with altrrnative rule

--- 帖子 #632 ---
The EA put a sell trade in place. And this morning, but not buy order. I've just deleted a sell trade because it looks like it's going up. Is there any reason why it did not put a buy trade on, Thank you

--- 帖子 #633 ---
sorry redfan,eventhough i always open my mind for a new idea,i dont think we should discuss the others method here.we have to.make this method as simple as possible and optimize it as good as we can. if there is any indicator that can filter the bad trade,or any indicator to.optimize our trade we can discuss and share it here, but please dont change the method.thanks for your understanding.you can start a thread and maybe we can discuss about your new strategy there.thanks

--- 帖子 #634 ---
i think its because its under the ema 24 in hourly chart. so the ea only.open sell stop.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Yes, that's fine. I've deleted the post, hope I have not offended you. I can only apologise.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Like everyone who has a full-time job, I trade mainly on mobile, where tools like EAs cannot be applied. So I would appreciate if this could be taken in consideration.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Really? I'd get a new broker! Both the ones I had in the past allowed you to apply loads of indicators. Try ETX or Ig Index. I prefer ETX as they allow for OCO orders, but it's what's right for you in your country really. If you can't apply the ema try the CCI(24). Shows the same really. CCI above 0 = buy; CCI below 0 = sell only

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Thanks for your reply. I use Fxpro , which allows to use a lot indicators. What you cannot use on mobile platforms, as far as I know, are the expert advisers (EA).

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Sorry - my error. I read EA as MA! You could buy a cheap laptop and then only install MT4 on that and just leave the EA running with laptop booted up. I've done that before. Just use a screensaver! Alternatively, ProRealtime charting (with them direct or via IGIndex) allowing ProReal coding - and EAs to sit within that environment. Maybe someone could code the system in PRT code? This would then sit on their server, and negate the need for personal laptop running all day.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
so today trade, use the 10 tp and 13 sl. today took the profit easily. sum up for this week 3 trade win, 1 trade lose,and one no trade. still a good week.green pips.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
its okay,thanks

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Thanks for your reply. I agree that so far these are the best rules.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
This method needs probably further evaluation. During the last week brought to three consecutive losses, one positive result and one no trade, ending up with negative pips.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
###ZenTrader EA V09 Please read post # 576 for the rules. Now ea uses Market Orders for entries. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Most Important Setting is "StartTradingTime" (default 9:00) It's Frankfurt Open Time which is 1 hour before London Session Opening Time. This value has to be set in accordance with your Broker's Market Watch Time. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Ill review later but I didn't have 3 losses. If you take a random 3 month back test from any historical period you will see the ma filter keeps you out of more losing trades than the original method. You need to pick a period and then walk forward each day capturing the results for both methods. This will give you greater confidence

--- 帖子 #646 ---
grear stuff thanks Grand. Will load up later. Top drawer stuff.

Thanks grand, will try the EA.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Thanks for the advice, which I will follow. The week from 24th to 28th april I detected anyway 1 negative, 1 positive and three no trade with the new method and 5 positive trades with Zen method. Am I correct?

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Loss this morning with eurusd with Zen method

--- 帖子 #651 ---
i still not.open the trade, because now i used smoothed 5 and 10 to filter the trade.only trade the ma direction ,do not against the ma. open buystop @1.0930. tp @1.0940 sl @1.0917. lets see

--- 帖子 #652 ---
i look at the price,how many pips sl.do you use? i think you suppose not lose yet ,the price trigger @1.0910 and go up to 1.09216.the sl suppose not hit yet.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Can you clarify in details whst are the currents rules? Thanks

--- 帖子 #654 ---
'the rules is use the candle one hour before london open,mark the high and low and trade the 00 level after it. but for the filter there is no exact rules about it.,just create your filter and.try the optimize it. as for now i use smoothed ma 5 and 10 period to filter the bad trades. as for others maybe they are using different method to filter the bad trade.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Original Rule 1 was profitable yesterday. Made 10pips after five or six hours as EURUSD pair was caught in a range

--- 帖子 #656 ---
yes.today if you use original rules without filter it also will be profit,original rules should open trade sell stop @1.0920 and should took profit already @1.0910.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi Grand The EA took an incorrect trade this morning on EU? Any ideas why? It bought EU at the bottom of the H1 candle when it should have invoked Rule 2 and bought at 1.0937 and not 1.0925? I'm using the 0900 candle buy, 24 ema and rule 1 and rule 2 Best

--- 帖子 #663 ---
nope, its not that we abondoned v9, its just i havent tried the EA v9. I think the different would be v8 is using pending order and the v9 using market order.

hi Zentrader8 , low of 8th hour candel is 1.09708, so why your sell stop at 1.09800? it should not at 1.09700?

Hi zentrader8 keep getting a 404 page not found when I tried to message you. No, I'm not using a real account yet. I was going to start it two weeks ago, But I came across thread. Scalping the EUR at the European open, I got interested in tellboy strategy. Basically I like the way the EUR/USD and the EUR/JPY are synchronized. So what I've been doing is trading EUR/USD on your system, And trading the EUR/JPY also. So instead of getting one winning trade, I'm now getting two. I'm not using a EA because I'm up at 6.45 UK time and I put my trade on just after 7 o'clock candle open UK TIME and I use a buy stop AND sell stop order. Just about Tickmill I found the spread to be very good on EUR/USD , and trading has been very smooth with no re-quotes. Green pips to you.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Zen -are you now using Tickmill? What are they like? Do they spoof the EA etc? Are they CFD broker or spreadbetting? It wasn't clear on their page sadly

yes.im using tickmill now.so far so good.it is a well regulated forex broker i think.(fca &amp; fsa regulated ).they have cfd and index product as well, you can use EA as well.i found the tickmill spread for eurusd pair is good,and the commision is lower than icmarkets.

SL hit, both 10/12 hit. done for today.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
This shows the beauty of only selling below the MA and buying above. My order is still in the market at .30 level below the last swing low. The MA tells me to short, but I only want to below the last low, ie trend continuation. You can use the EA to test differing variables of MA, SL, TP etc. Whilst it will not give exact results it will show you quickly if there is merit in applying certain variables for more thorough backtesting and forward testing; this is how I arrived at my ATR based stop strategy. It also showed that the 0600-0700 UK candle was the most profitable to set orders when it closed.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
In saying that, my trade hit S/L too on news volatility at 1330. That's the breaks. Always next week.

Some times i trade that way.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attachment g Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sorry about this but the two charts with the currency meters I took at 8.30 this morning when you asked me the question, By that time the USD was moving upwards. The chart at the bottom was took at 7.15, when the USD was at the bottom of the currency meter. That's why I took the trade, And remember we are only going 10 pips. I took my profit. And if you look that candle then turn red. THAT why the USD started to move up. Sorry if I confuse you.

Thanks for your message. Can you answer me a couple questions. There are 3 different account types. Which one are you using, or which one do you recommend. In the market watch box on the demo account. The clock is 2 hours ahead of my clock, but on Tickmill site it says, Trading hours Forex Trading Available 24/5 - from Monday 00:00 to Friday 24:00 (Server time, GMT + 3). Are you trading live , do you know why the time is different on the real account, last question Are the indicators and EA working like they do on the demo, Thank you for your time

I'm not sure EA V9 is working correctly as it was taking a v2 trade this week with a 10 pips TP instead of ATR based. It also took the v2 trade when it should have been a V1 trade as price touched the MA. Is Grandeavus still around?

Grimweasel , I believe I finally wrapped my head around the original LO strategy...works pretty good. I wouldn't mind having some more trading opportunities.. Just to clarify, with your US Open approach: 1. You're using the 0930 EST candle as your "open/starting" candle? 2. How many candles from the original 0630 EST open do you go back to set the High/Low levels? 3. I didn't catch what your TP/SL were? I think you're using the ATR ("value" ?) Would you mind stating that again? What do you find is the usual movement...10 pips...15 pips ?? Do you think you could get 20 pips? Thanks in advance.

Hey there Zen! Been following "and replying" to this thread for a while now, just wanted to ask do you guys still use the EA or are you manually trading it everyday? ~ Tim

--- 帖子 #722 ---
I trade manually, as I never trust EAs in MT4. Too many spoofing back doors, plus my broker has wider stops on MT4 than the web based platform. They are helpful for idea backtesting though.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hi, I essentially trade 3 systems in one. Normal Zen rules with 10pip TP and 15 pip SL for any candle that touches the 24ema If price &gt; ema, then trade long 1 tick above last 24hr high. 1xATR stop and 2xATR TP If price &lt; ema, then trade short, opposite of above; same SL and TP I ditched the EurJpy trade as not profitable. Use the Grandeavus EA for backtesting is my tip; find the best session / set of rules for your personal style of trading and go with that. Given the B/O spread it should restrict you to the Major pairs. Good trading!

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Hi Timnyman For me i still use manual trade everyday either.

Hi Zentrader8 I've been reviewing this system. I have had the same results as you last week and today, they seem to be letting us put a trade on, and then spiking it the other way. It's as if they're playing with us, so I've checked the last 20 days because I notice something, I think for the next week , I'm going to try using the red and the blue line indicator, but I'm going to set it up on the 9 o'clock candle and going to set a buy and a sell trade and use the blue and red lines for my stops the minutes one of the trade is live I'm going to close the other one, I have checked the last 20 days and if I was using this method.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
yes, actually you also can use that method. But using the blue line and red line as stop loss will make the stop loss unfixed on numbers means sometimes it can be small and sometimes can be big.And also, i think if you use the method, somehow it will also have the bad week like this method. maybe it better, or maybe it can be worse.I think this original method will have better week, and i just try to accept it, because no holy grail, sometimes system fails,sometimes it works. just accept the lose, and trade to wins more. The important things is in long run we have to win. if you want to use it, i suggest we have to research it more , try it for forward test.

Okay, after two hours. The EUR/ GBP is going sideways so I have close it down. It's probably got something to do with UK having a general election.

Yes, I made a mistake, this morning when putting the lot size in , I put 5.0 instead of .50 so I closed the trade down in profit straightaway, but the original method still worked and still puts us in profit for the week. Have a nice weekend, Attached Image (click to enlarge)

today lost, lost 10 pips done for today.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
just made the summary for may 2017, that months original method earned 56 pips. Everyday trade with 12 pips take profit and 10 pips stop loss wins 13 trade and lost 10 trade. ended the month with green pips. if every day you risk 10 pips as 1% then it would means 5.6 % profit.(the summary not included the comisiion) if 2% then it means 11.2 % profit for last month. Not bad for a stress free method.

After following this trading system. I do agree with you, it is pretty steady and when it does go against you, you are only risking 1%, I would give it 8/10 and the only reason I'm giving you 8/10, I would like to trade more than once in a day. But it is a good system, ps. It would be nice if we could get a EA that actually trades this system,

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I see.but if you trade more than one trade, you can earn more, but of course you risk more. Trade 1/2 /3/4/5 times a day doesnt really matter.You can increase the percentage per trade if you want to risk more. I can trade once a day and profit more more than people who trade much more trades. the only matter is the winning percentage of the trade you took. Right now im still using the zentrader EA v4. and its so far so good.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
today trade ended with loss

--- 帖子 #782 ---
yes,monday and tuesday ended with lost. i found a new method to improve the system. the method is : open two pendin order,the entry is the same with the original system. each order is 1%.or 0.5% the different is the tp first order use 12 pips tp with 10 pips sl second order use 5 pips tp with 10 pips sl. this way if you use the 1% for each order win both u will gain 17 pips which is 1.7%(without comission fee ). if you lose the first one and win the second trade you will lose only 5 pips which is only 0.5%(without commision fee) if you lose both you will lose 2%.(without.comission fee) which is rarely happens! you can check many of the trades it moves 5 pips then go to the different direction.this way we can reduce the lose ,and increase the winning ratio by trading two trades.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
today trade ended with profit . this week.1 lose on both trade 3 mix results(lose on first trade and win on second.trade) and 1 winning both trade. still in red week this week.

--- 帖子 #784 ---

yesterday no trade. because bank holiday no liqudity. Today trade Open two trade Buy stop @1.1360 TP 1.1372(12 pips TP) Buy stop @1.1360 TP 1.1365(5 pips TP) Both use 10 pips SL Attached Image (click to enlarge) Lets see. If first trade lose and second trade win then only lose 5 pips.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Yesterday i examine the new method using 2 trades like i told you guys before(using 5 pips and 12 pips both using 10 pips SL) I check the June results for original method, if only using one trade with 12 pips TP and 10 SL . you will ended with lose -44 pips. But if you use two trade(using 5 pips and 12 both as TP with 10 pips SL) you will still ended with winning 6 pips! I think this method is great! Not just good! its really great! June is not a good month, but we can still winning some green pips if we use two trades.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Update: first trade with 5 pips TP already, Now only one trade left(12 pips TP). its safe already, even though i lose the trade i lose only 5 pips.

Good morning, I am following this thread from the very beginning. Last week I came back to see what was happening here since I was away from may. Hence I have question to all who are still here. Are you keeping up with this method (original or modified)? Are you getting profits? Can you present some past performance since march 2017 (starting of the thread)? Thanks! Hope to hear from ya' all.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
hi im still here.now im trading.with modified method. these few weeks is not a good day with these method but if you trade from the beginning of.year i.think.it would be profit after all..maybe you can run a bit backtest with these modified method(5 tp and 12 tp) with 10 pips stop loss..im still trading the same.method.i think consistency is one of factor to be succeed.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
today trade both ended with profits , gain 17 pips today.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Read and re-read this thread for the past 2 days. Tried the original Zen method yesterday. I traded A/J yesterday (+19.8) at the Tokyo Open and E/U this morning (+25) on the London Open for a total of 44.8 pips. Waking up this morning, I see that I could've gotten more, but I set my SL/TP and went with it, so I am very satisfied. Thanks Zen &amp; Grim for your contributions. I hope to follow these with more winning trades.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Good evening, I am still interested in this method and I am doing now automatic backtests based on first post. I use six month periods blocks due to daylight saving time and clock changes march/october. I will not elaborate on details but to my best calculation this strategy give 62% positive trades in 2016. I hope my small contribution to this thread will profit you all. Best!

--- 帖子 #606 ---
this backtest use 15 pips sl and 10 pips tp?without any martiangle? Could you please help me to check the second method, which use two trade 5 and 12 pips tp with 10 pips sl.because right now i currently use this method. thankyou very much.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Yes. Those are my variables and there was no martiangle. Second trade on the same day is on average 60% positive but it will not change profits to your favor. You must be aware that although 62% trades were positive, Stop Loss to Take Profit ratio in unfavorable. Profit Factor for this strategy is 0.79 . And only above 1.20 we can talk about profitable strategy. This setup will, unfortunately, loose money.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
okay thanks. thats why i use two trade,.remember if we use two tradethen it will reduce the risk and also there are some intersecting on the risk.example: if first trade win we gain 5 pips. and the second trade we lose then we only lost 5 pips. but if we both take profit we gain 17 pips. so i think the profit factor hasnt calculated it.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
today both trade ended with profits,earn 17 pips today

--- 帖子 #610 ---
today both trade ended with profits .17 pips today

--- 帖子 #611 ---
That would be great if you could post some weekly or monthly win/loss numbers. How many wins etc. As I do like this strategy I can not find it profitable. Testing it I can see clearly it do not have chance in the long run: 1. TP/SL is unfavorable, 2. There is no chance to make a strategy out of 62% wins because to work it needs -15 SL factor. If you change SL the strategy is less than 50% accurate, 3. The only period it was successful is year 2016. All other years tested from 2008 to 2017 are negative. All of them . There is no way around it. Adding second trade make you bleed slower. But still you are not earning. If you have any cont-arguments with my findings I would be more than greateful to see it.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Here is the excel document from may this year until today.For the parameter, I use 10 pips SL for both trades, and for TAKE PROFIT, i use 5 pips for first trade, and 12 pips for second trade. and it still not count the commision and slippage.(I only count the pips). Thanks, hope it can helps .

--- 帖子 #613 ---
What kind of method did you use to backtest? The data i get is from forward testing from may. Notice from the end of july- early August,there is a lot of minus. The other month i think the method is doing fine.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hey, Regarding your excel: you took 85 trades and and won 38. That alone give you 44,7% accuracy . This is not enough with SL and TP that you are using. Statistical odds are not in your favor. Also you have 2 winning months and 2 loosing ones. So you have 50% monthly period success. If may wouldn't be so good you would be loosing. I have tested this system for last 9 years using Historical Backtested. Tick for tick every opening 5 days a week. Excluding holidays and bank holidays. I have also tried to optimize it but best results are with TP=10 and SL=15. Other decent results are with TP=15 and SL=15. But as you can see it looks like 50% accuracy system with risk-to-reward 1:1. And this is at best! I was getting 35% equity loss in about 5 months of trading. Every year . Sorry to say, but I move along. This is waste of time.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Yesterday i run a backtest with this EA on MT4, and i try to match it with my results from May.and the results is unmatch, i think the backtest results is wrong! you can try to match the backtest result with the data i took from may. I saw on the details and try to match it, some of the data, in my data is winning, then on the backtest result is losing, and also some of the data i lose, and it win. I think its very strange, and i think it doesnt show the real perfomance of the method.
