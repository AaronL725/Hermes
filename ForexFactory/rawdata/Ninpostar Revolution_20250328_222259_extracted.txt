Hi, I want to share with the people of this great forum so that all wisdom given to us. Almost always I have used this indicator on my systems and I have always realized its effectiveness, until recently, I decided to look for a setting that gave me the best entries and I think I've succeeded. Just say that today I have generated a profit of 1200pips in 10 currency pairs. It is the indicator QQE MTF v5,!!! INSTRUCTIONS -Operate only in TF 1M! -Buy: When QQE cross upward, when QQE re-crossing the low, we get out of the operation but re-enter in sell !!!!!!!!!!! well all the time and finish up the day with some succulent pips! is very simple, and works on any currency pair! Any questions or suggestions will be welcome!,

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Stop loss?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
That is the purpose of the other indicators?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
the stop loss is when it crosses over the qqe be our entry again! Make the test is simple,

--- 帖子 #5 ---
The other indicators are going to see how the trend but only heed QQE!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
That is take profit, but when you enter what is your stoploss 10 pips?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
When again is crossbred our STOP, set when there is a fall but still keeps us within the trend! is when he returns to cross qqe! My English is very bad, pardon! Each time you enter a position without stop and go without take, just waiting to cross qqe, is warning sound! I understand?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I downloaded your QQE indicator to try it out, dragged it onto the price chart, but instead of getting the red and blue line over the top of the candles, like you show, I get a window at the bottom with a blue line wiggling up and down over a horizontal red line. What am I doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
You have to move from 1M to 5M tf tf, so that the indicator take shape, and go back to 1M TF.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Just use the template he has provided keep it simple. As for stops people are always asking what is the stop.......who knows until you see the trade set up. Mart

--- 帖子 #11 ---
How long have you been trading this system and why 1 minute timeframe why not higher ? also what is your maximum loss on a single trade or if you dont have one what is you maximum loss before it was a winner ? best regards

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Same problem here!!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
No hay problema, en tu idioma: Entonces no usas stop loss, solo sales y entras cuando se cruza el qqe y aparece la señal (bola roja o verde), pero no puede pasar que el precio caiga 50 pips en tu contra antes de que el qqe cambie.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi ninpojutsu, After a (very) quick look, this indi has piqued my interest. One quick question, do you have issues with the MTF indicator changing values? I've read that they change values until the larger TF bar closes. Thanks! Seavo

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Because of trade with this system took more than 6 months, but I realize that this indicator alone is the one who created me more benefits and better entries, which I have been a better indicator in the 1M. The biggest loss that you can have if there were a lot of movement may be 30pips but opening 4 pairs will always be positive.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hola altezza!! Puede ser que salgamos en alguna entrada en negativo, pero piensa que tiene q ser una gran caida, lo recuperamos en la siguiente entrada, ya te digo que ningun dia que comercializo con el sistema salgo negativo, siempre en positivo y muuuuuchos pipps!! eres de españa?¿

--- 帖子 #17 ---
If you look at the pic provided, Ninpostar is using mt4 with an additional digit in the price, eg eu has 5 decimal places. I tried this on an mt4 that has 4, wouldn't work, but works with one that has 5!! Maybe its possible to get a version of the mtf qqe that will work onmost brokers mt4 platforms. Pardy

--- 帖子 #18 ---
how to use laguerre thanks

--- 帖子 #19 ---
OK, te tengo unas preguntas: 1-entonces tu manera de operar es entrar a todas las señales que te entrega tu sistema? 2-Veo que las bolas verdes y rojas esta relacionadas con el Laguerre? 3-Que pares sigues durante tu dia de trading? Me parece bien, voy a probar tu sistema la semana que viene entrando y saliendo continuamente. Soy de Chile. Saludos.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Using the template i have opened 3 trades on EUR/USD 1M. It has closed each one as soon as it hit the server (almost same second). Paul The fourth one it let stay til trading closed for week losing 13 pips

--- 帖子 #21 ---
This is just a straight QQE. There's several threads here and on TSD with QQE methods. What's to crack, Pardy? This looks exactly the same on my 4 digit broker as on my 5 digit broker. The only thing you have to do for a 5 digit is increase the distance from 30 to 300 because of the extra 10th -- but that's only for a visual of the dot.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
the Laguerre is only for view the trend,Based only on the QQE, the balls appear when crossing the QQE, use about 9 pairs, but it exposed here so we can get more performance.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Ninpo, On the chart you posted on the first post, your third trade for +11 - are you sure that was a positive trade? Looking at the entry and exit, it looks like it would be a break even at best. Thanks S

--- 帖子 #24 ---
You're quite right of course. Just took a few minutes to settle down and display correctly. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
How long are you trading this system? Whats your records? Regards hace cuánto que estás traeando este sistema? cómo andàs con los reports? Soy argentino. Un abrazo

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Nice simple system. But what setting is you qqe set to. It is obviously not the default setting (smoothing 5).

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I think this sytem benefits from the long trends the middle and small trends it seems like a loser. I dont know if it is profitable in the long run would be intresting if anyone could backtest it. Also what time in the day are you trading this system my time is GMT+1 sweden best regards

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I can't seem to get the qqe and laguere to show up in the im Tf, it shows up on 5m but when i switch to 1m it doesn't show up

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Go in each indicator edit and change colors then you can see them. If you use the template the colors are already changed.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Ninpojutsu, well done, The system will be more profitable. I've tested and I've made a lot of pips. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
do you use it in 1 min timeframe? do you use TP and SL? Thank you Cómo lo probaste? en 1 min? usaste SL o TP? un saludo para vos.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi, Neurus, yes I have used this system in 1 min Timeframe, The SL AND PROFIT is the qqe crossover. I have only used this system during 7 days and 20 minutes per day, because I haven't got much time. Good Trading Hola Neurus, si he usado este sistema en un minuto de periodo de tiempo, el Stop Loss y el Profit te lo dan los cruzes del qqe, Solo he usado el sistema durante 7 dias y 20 minutos por dia porque no tengo mucho tiempo. Buen trading.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
hi Ninpo your system seems simple and gr8 thanks for sharing it with us.I have some questions to ask if u dont mind...wich pairs do u trade? if you are losing lets say 50 pips do u keep the discipline and stay in the trade until it goes up and cross qqe or do u leave the trade? and in news time how does the system work do u wait 30 mins after and before news? thanks

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Coqui en estos 7 días cuantos pips por dia conseguiste y en que paridades. Gracias.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Well i got it visible but now my buy and sell arrows anre interchanged and the pip profit figures are wonky? Anyone know how i can fix this?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
All those arrows and the text go with his chart at the time he made the template -- not at the time you applied the template to your chart. Just delete all that stuff -- the text, arrows and pip totals.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Yes! is very simple, we only have to be very consistent and always follow the QQE. Sorry for the template that will be engraved arrows! delete it! You can do as the T101 system, using 14 pairs of foreign currencies and go QQE opening positions when you tell! On Thursday alone with doing EURJPY nearly 700 pips! Believe it is possible, do the test. I work all day without watching the news, as it always get the sharp ups and downs of the news. If until I prove uncomfortable to operate with a single indicator, but it is possible! Make pips! And if we can create an all EA! have to be very easy! Ha gracias Coqui!! esto da unos resultados de la ostia!!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Whenever you have a story to keep us inside the QQE smoothly!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thank you for sharing, however what are the setting on QQE 5Min ? Do you use default setting for all pairs? Did you trade on EUR/USA on friday during US session and what was the result? Many thanks for your kind help.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
what time to gmt+1 are you trading this system ? hope this system works i know i sound sceptic but i dont mean to be rude my indicator stop working after some time it is like it is set for a number of bar back in time when i look backa mounth or so the indicator stop working ?? best regards

--- 帖子 #42 ---
thanx ben and ninpojutsu

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I operate from 9:00 to 17:00 gmt +1 spain! EURUSD just say that on Thursday gave me some 400pips. We only have to follow the crosses, you do the test, back! To begin using EURUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY and GBPUSD. When you have more experience and begin to use more foreign exchange. Only operate in 1M TF, Using default settings of the template. On Friday I make a profit of 1200pips! 9 currency pairs.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I'm currently trying to make an EA out of this, but the QQE_Alert_MTF_v5 indicator gives me differenet numbers than those displayed for color0 and 2 on the chart. I queried all available buffers (0 to 7), no go. Anyone has experience with using that indi in an EA?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
hi if we took the trade in between the 2 bleu lines ,it wuld be a losing trade , right ? thanks

--- 帖子 #46 ---
IMAD: if, of course I have some loss, but be minimal compared with the gain! On average the system gives about 10 signs in my work schedule, and 1 or 2 operations are negative. Yesterday morning at 2 hours do 800pips with 6 pairs active at the same time. Bonten: I have no idea of EA, if you have someone skilled and able to create, would be grateful. We serve a lot of help! Thanks

--- 帖子 #47 ---
NINPO: Look at this. 3 trades = 3 loses. Che NINPO: Ponete la pilas y explicá el sistema. Para muestra sólo hace falta un botón. Dónde están los SL?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Which broker are you using?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi ninpojutsu Thanks for taking the time to explain your system to all of us. Well I finally seem to have got the template up and working thanks to you, benQ and Plind. I'm sure the system is profitable but as english is not my native language either its a little hard for me to understand exactly what you say. I would very much appreciate if you could tell me if the following is correct or not 1)Use a 1min chart for any currency pair you trade 2)Use the Qqe with the settings Smoothing = 60 Time frame = 5 3)buy and go long when the qqe crosses over to the upside, sell and go short when the qqe crosses over to the downside. So basically we are always in a trade long or short. 4)Laguere is not really important but just gives us an idea of the strength of a trend. Is this correct. I've tried it out on GU1min chart and it somehow appears to be breakeven or a few pips profit at the best over many trades. Clearly I'm doing something wrong? Could you explain what I'm missing and if possible it would be great if you could upload your statement for yesterday so we can see the exact entry and exit points and undwerstand how you trade the system.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I think the 2° trade u show in picture is +51! it's a long trade and not short! I have try becktest this system and maybe it lack of filter. Lubo

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Now i try this setup. Lubo

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Bongiorno LUbo: I like your chart. Could you possibily tell us your entry points? Thanks

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi labo Can you post the additional Indictor side winder

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Please follow the initial setup! You wait for Monday and provide my settings! is profitable! very profitable!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi great method Ninpostar! I like the concept of trading the 5M TF in one minute bars using MTF QQE. I think a lot people will likely compare your approach with FXPrime's so let me give my 2cents: 1) Both are great methods. 2) Ninpostar is 100% mechanical. FXPrime has well-defined rules, but there is still a fairly high degree of judgement involved. 3) Ninpostar is hybrid of 1M and 5M TFs. FXPrime looks at 5M as a filter that you have to be aware of. 4) Ninpostar undergoes a lot of volatility during a trade. It stays in a trade while many times FXPrime will have exited and then reentered several times. You have be able mentally withstand drawdowns during a trade in order to get huge gains. In other words, the outcome of Ninpostar's trades is generally big profits, but in order to get there, you have to do down a rollarcoaster of sorts. If you trade FXPrime correctly, there is less volatility during a trade. 5) Ninopostar has fewer, but longer duration trades than FXPrime. 6) Just a guess: Ninpostar appears capable of trading the Asian market, because it adapts well to lower volatility movement. It looks like it'll stay in a trend over an hour and capture a few pips. But you have to watch it though. EDIT: One thing I forgot! 7) Ninopostar doesn't use an stops..."officially" at least, while FXPrime has stops as an important part of the strategy. Instead of stops Ninoposter is a buy and reverse to sell type of strategy. I suspect that many folks will opt to use an "emergency stop" or trial a wide stop of say 50 pips or so. Assuming Ninpostar is a moneymaker I think the decision of which strategy to trade boils down to what fits your personality. Some people may find Ninpostar a little less taxing mentally because you're not getting in and out so much.

Hi, would be nice if Ronald Raygun visits this thread. He is one of the fastest and best coders in this forum. He codes EAs for nearly every trading system when it's needed. Don't know if he reacts on pm-requests. Stefan

--- 帖子 #57 ---
It's just QQE. It's been around for a long time. Just search and I'm sure you'll find an EA if you want one.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thx Stefan

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Ninpojutsu, Thanks for posting your method. Does the Laquere play any role in your decision making to take the trade or not? If not, why to have it on your chart? I have also noticed the alert dots are sometimes not at the cross of QQE lines. What do you go by? Can you explain in more detail how you use this on the 101 basket method as you briefly mentioned? Thanks again. Regards

--- 帖子 #60 ---
will do ninpojutsu .........

--- 帖子 #61 ---
you're right Lubo ..... an oversight on my part.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I was just trying now that the market is closed. I have not tried it live. I have updated chart of the previous post by adding more information on entry and exits. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...1&amp;postcount=51 I enclose here indicators that I use and also the template. Lubo

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Ok thnk you for share your system. What is the use of the complex balance indicator? thanks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Why do you trade 9 or 10 currencies when maybe half of them are moving in the same direction, why not just choose those who are trading well and are not correlate, just a question i had, maybe there is something i do not understand...Please explain... thx again for this system... Max

--- 帖子 #65 ---
The QQE you can combine with any indicator! I combine with cci of fxprime. BACKTEST GBPUSD: TIME: From 9:00 to 19:50 GMT +1 TOTAL: 10 TRADES POSITIVE, NEGATIVE TRADE 1. BUY: 16162-16174 = +12 SELL: 16174-16139 = +35 BUY: 16139-16227 = +88 SELL: 16227-16178 = +49 BUY: 16178-16187 = +9 SELL: 16187-16059 = +128 BUY: 16059-16135 = +76 SELL: 16135-16164 = -29 BUY: 16164-16180 = +16 BUY: 16180-16223 = +43 SELL: 16223-16147 = +76 TOTAL:503 PIPS!! The sack performance thanks to this indicator as I have ever had!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi neurus, Complex Balance only draws a line on main chart between the price points where the Complex pair crosses the 0 line. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
lubolabo maybe you shall start a thread on you own, im intrested in you system also and would be happy if you explain it little more + best regards

--- 帖子 #68 ---
good point but wich one are the same so we can awoid them ? best regards

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi jgadefelth, as I said in a previous post, my tests are only based on the original system of the QQE posted by ninpojutsu, and wants to be a contribution to this system. I do not think that will open a new topic, at least until, among all the systems that I am testing, I find one that really suits me more and that will give me real results. Thanks for your appreciation. Lubo

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi: How do you use FXPrime? Is that just for confirmation? FXprime gets in and out on smaller moves while you hold for the longer move. The two strategies are different enough that I think use both would make it more complicated which I think defeats the purpose of your strategy.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi . I am new to this forum . Please explain how to join two startegies on one trading platform i.e urs and canadian dude's. Is there any template u can post . Thanks.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
You confuse me here what strategy are you using here is the orginal woith only one indicator is it more and if so wich ones and how ? best regards

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Dear Ninpojutsu, I can not download your indicator. Can you,please,help me. Maybi, you tell me the movings of indicator and I do iy myself? If it is impossible just with movies,please, tell me how set my computer in order to download your indicator. Thank you, have a great weekend,

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I do not want to answer instead of ninpo, but I think we're trying to use the initial strategy, perhaps adding some other indicator that confirms or can filter the main indicator, which remains the QQE, to avoid false signals. Lubo. P.s. there was something wrong with tpl posted earlier, I proceeded to update it . http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...6&amp;postcount=62 Lubo

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks for sharing.. Anyway, you shouldn´t SUM the pips but average them. It´s a common mistake sum pips when trading different pairs. If we trade one pair and make 10 pips and at same time we trade another pair and make another 10 pips, the fact is you just did 10 pips total, not 20 (because you cannot allocate all money in both trades.. you have to split it). I know it looks cool to show 503 pips, but i think you didn´t do 503, but an average number of all trades.~ Regards and good work Carllos

--- 帖子 #76 ---
How about using this entry method with the CCfp indicator on the "Relative Strength" thread...This way you would be entering in the direction of a possible ongoing trend?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I think its his original strategy, just use the qqe 5min time frame setting on a 1 min chart and you'll get almost identical pip values as nipojutsu has shown. Try it yourself by starting at 0800 GMT on 31st Oct on GBPUS.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I did not understand what you mean? In the post of ninpo you quote,I read only the pair GBP/USD? Could you explain more your concept? Thank you Lubo

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Ninpojutsu, A BIG THANKS to you for sharing this system!!!!!!!! It looks like a Goldmine on my back tests this last week. I will test it live this week in my demo then move up to micro and then mini account with real $$$. I will let you know how it goes!!! Thanks again!!!!!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I don't think anyone allocates all his money on one trade, besides we aren't looking at "the money he's made" as that would depend on position sizing and money management. I think we're simply trying to see the effectiveness of qqe trading the 5min qqe on 1 min charts by measuring the number of pips gained.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi Rick, What you refer to? I have not seen anyone here use or mention the indicator ccfp. Lubo

--- 帖子 #82 ---
At all pictures TF setting of QQE is 5min, the system itself operates on 1min. I understand it is correct ?? What is a laguerre TF setting ?? Krzysztof

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Thanks, but that part I know and in fact I prefer NJ's approach. What I'm asking about the fact that he has FXPrime's CCI set up there in that previous screenshot and, from what I can see, it detracts from the simplicity of what NJ is trying to do with the pure Ninpo appraoch. Again, follow FXPrime will get in and out with smaller crumbs (not a bad thing, mind you) will less drawdown, while Ninpostar will take a larger mouthful. The two sort of don't go together.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I thought these were all referring to the one day results of trading GBPUSD, i.e. the chart that accompanied the performance. If that's correct that summing the pips would be appropriate.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Guys, please, help me understand how to download ninu indicator? I can not download no one indicator fromm FF. how to download this ex4 file? Shoud I pay to some service online in order to be able to download the indicators from Foresfaxtory site? I tried already many times and diffrent indicators and no results. Thank you for help,

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Maiybi I must download some programm which gives possibility to get Ninpoyutsu indicator and use ex4 files? When I try to open his ex4 file indicator windows writes me:Fyle type: unknown. Windows does not recognize this file type. Please,help me and thank you,

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Nin do you enter a trade on the cross of the indicator or on the red and green dots the lots are little later then the actual cross of the indicator ? best regards

--- 帖子 #88 ---
lite 27 you must have the program meta trader 4 that you can get fo free with many brokers download it do a search on google. best regards

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Wow, 6 pages in 39 hours, I think that's a new record here at FF

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thank you very much for advice. Can you,please, recomend me a site where I can download Metatrader 4 for free? or tell me what MT4 do you use. Thank you once more!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hello! The settings I propose is that I gave these results and it is always continuous pips. The good thing is I always go back and we missed any of it out soon. We can provide the configuracionde: SMOOTH 60 TF 5 And also gave me great results: SMOOTH 30 TF 15 Provan latter is great! Tomorrow may provide to make nuggets! I've been using this system at the discretion! Without looking at other indicators, I say that you can combine in order to better see the trend, but the original system is at the discretion act! comprovate please this configuration!! smooth 30 TF 15

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I have downloaded Metatrader 4 with FXDD broker, but still I can not download the indicator. Whats to do?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I think your idea is good. I'll try it these week.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
bonten, MCFly, Ronald Raygun is a good programer. There is also Swingman. He is very good. I send him a e-mail. It would be interesting to have a dashboard indicator. The first colum represent the currencies pairs, the second the spread the third a green arrow when the TF1' QQE crosses up and a red arrow when it crosses down. Then one can select directly which pair is good for the trading. Perhaps one of the readers can program this kind of indicator. Thank for each help!

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I do not think is a good idea, the RS does not work. I believe that it is founding on a wrong assumption. Lubo

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I have tested with vHandsTrade, my set up, with indicators attached to in my previous post, QQE set to TF1, but is rather negative. I have tried to test the QQE set to TF5, but I did not manage, because it does not work with vHand in M1 timeframe chart. Then I tested another idea with QQE set to TF1 &amp; smoothing 30, and with the complex pair indicator: it buys and sells when both from high above or low below are moving quickly in that direction and pass the line of 0. The result of my first try on 3 days of trade with 200 Euro initial balance and 0.1 lot per trade are 287 euro gain. Some of you can test with vHands, the original strategy with QQE TF5 on M1 chart?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi Lite, You need metatrader for the indiactor to work, please download a demo version form any broker who offers metatrader, you could try ODLsecurirites or IBFX ..... there are several others as well who offer metatrader. Place the indicator in the experts --&gt;indicators folder. Once you've done this start metatrader go to the indicators tab and select qqe.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thank you very much. Please, tell me step by step how can I put the indicator into Metatrader? Sorry, for this. I just tried to open indicator with help of MT4,but could not. I do something wrong,for sure. Thank you once more,

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi Ninpojutsu: When you say: "original system is at the discretion act!" Do you mean: 1) You only buy and sell when the QQQ crosses? Or do you mean: 2) Some times you don't follow the exact rules? If you don't understand my question...can you ask someone who speaks your language to answer this question. I think it is very important for everyone on this thread to understand whether or not you intend for this system to be used 100% mechanically. There are some who say, there is no such thing as 100% mechanical system and they're probably right. But from my preliminary backtesting, (manual, since it doesn't work with simulators like Vhands), the system seems to hold up when the rules are followed.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
This thread moved so far so fast lol I didn't catch it for almost a day. They exist, I agree. And perhaps would be easier for someone to modify. Also, the fact that I'm able to code EAs quickly could mean one thing: It's a variation of the many other types of trading systems which I've already done. It means the idea was already thought up and previously beaten to death. I'm curious to know why you don't simply use a QQE with smoothing 60 on the 5M tf?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Here's the EA, i was hesitating to release it since it's not profitable. There seems to be a repaint issue with the QQE indi since the retrieved values do not correspond to the ones displayed on the chart. This makes the EA lag behind. Sometimes the indi signals crossings that are not even displayed on the chart, thus my assumption that it repaints the past. There are additional filters needed to make this profitable.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi majorbillion I'll try to translate your questions To Ninpo Ninpo, te traduzco las consultas de Majorbillion, él quiere sabar si cuando te referis a a que el sistema original es discrecional, te referis a que: 1) Solo compras o vendes cuando se produce un cruce en QQE? O 2) A que algunas vbeces no seguis las reglas exactamente como son? Cualquier duda estoy a tu disposición por lo que necesites. Bull

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Yes! only enter-exit, enter-exit....etc! This indicator no repaints!! This picture shows that the most moving moments of the system always gives us good signs! I take a long time to operate this system and got many nuggets and no overall loss! As best display is trading in live! unable to speculate without having surgery!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Gracias BULL!! Es totalmente a discreción, osea no importa lo que veamos, solo nos guiamos con los cruzes de QQE! Es la unica regla, pero cada unos puede salirse si be que la ganancia va hacia un pico bien alto, eso es cosa de cada uno, pero siguiendo el sistema siempre saldremos positivos.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
That has me puzzled as well. Don’t forget that a 5 min indicator on a 1 min chart will not look like the charts you have displayed here. It will not be fixed until 5 bars have closed.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
does the indicator repaint?? I didn't see that, after setting it up correctly and testing it manually I really think we have something worth while pursuing here ........ finally ...... well at least for the time being. Unfortunately this week has got a lot of news realses so I don't know how effective Nipo's system will be ... but I'm still very hopeful.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Lite if you're using windows just copy the indicator and go to windows explorer. Find your metatrader folder (it should be in C: Program files) , then go to ---&gt;experts ----&gt;indicators ... and past it in there. After this start metatrader, click on the "indicators" button go to custom, and select qqe from the list. It should now show up in your chart pane. There's no reason to be sorry I asked the very same question a few months ago.... and I'm still learning

--- 帖子 #108 ---
sounds seriously what can we do to do it better on another timeframe or setting or remake the indicator to a better one ? best regards

Hi bonten, I tried to test the original strategy with vHandsTrade. The line of QQE is not shown, but the dots appear. The result is not profitable. But then I checked the chart of the test with the standard chart and, dots do not match. On the test chart dots appear after those of standard chart. Maybe so happens in EA done by you? I think it remains only to test the strategy live. Lubo

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Ninpojutsu, Can you download the same QQE indicator like this in the template because with the indicator of the 1st posted message I have not the trigger line. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I think you're all missing the point... If the strategy is based on the cross of the 5 min QQE, why should you use the 1M chart? Supposedly, I should be able to remove the bars switch to the 5M timeframe to remove repainting issues, and only look at the QQE for my trades. Anyone here doing that?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I have not seen that the qqe repaint. Use the QQE M5 on TF1 is the original ninpo strategy. Lubo

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I'd be surprsed if it did not repaint. How can it not -- you need 5 M1 bars to complete. Same as all MTF indis -- the higher TF needs to complete before you have a signal.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
This doesn't produce a pop-up alert? The only alert I see is in the charts upper left. I can't get a configuration that produces a pop-up, which makes it difficult to trade multiple pairs.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
It is true what you say, but I think it simply marks the dot only when there is the cross on TF5.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I agree with Ron on this one. The point of using mtf methods is to establish the trend and then enter on a lower tf. So if you are going to use the mtf qqe on the 1 min chart with a smoothing of 60 and tf set on the 5 min chart, you would then use an indicator on the 1 min, for example qqe smoothing set at 60 tf 1 min, to enter and exit the trade. Will have far better results in the long run than just trading the 5 min qqe cross imho.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
145 pips up now, waiting for the qqe out signal

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I am trying the default settings of the template from first post. I notice the setting of QQE are at 15M, but to use on 1M. I have 3 crosses on G/U 1M so far (using Alpari) and watching it also on 5M G/U just one cross so far. All have been profitable. Just wierd to me. Will keep watching live for awhile. We weren't supposed to change the settings on QQE were we?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Yes. Although I'm not removing the bars...the only the I'm paying attention to is the QQE. Up 50 pips so far...obviously need to build up a bigger sample size.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Thank you NJ. The fact that you intend to be 100% mechanical really sets it apart from FXPrime. As I've said before, one isn't necessarily better than the other. Some people may prefer mechanical to discretion and vice versa. I agree that putting to the test in live trading conditions is the only way for us see how well it works. Even if the repainting issue is a real one, I suppose it's entirely possible that that the system is still working for you. We'll have to see this week under real market conditions.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Maybe i didn't get this template from first post. The one i am using has smoothing 30 and TF 15M. Whatever, it is working great placing it on 1M and placing it on 5M........so far.....just watching QQE crosses on G/U.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
My first trades. Some of them touch 90 - 120 pips but waiting for qqe exit, loss a lot of pips. And have a big los on gbp usd, maybe we need to use a stop loss. thanks

--- 帖子 #123 ---
IF you wait for QQE to cross back to exit, you will lose alot since it's only good when the trend is strong else just grab the PIPs.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Lost a boatload of pips with this already. Every trade I've tried has turned against me before profiting and rocketed the other direction. Watch out for this one unless you can withstand the drawdowns. B

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Set 3 more trades on signal........... ALL losers. B

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Results for this morning!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
10 minuts more!!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hello Nippo, can you please post the ea that you are using on your charts???

--- 帖子 #129 ---
NO is a EA! is a manual trade!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
this is not even a system. it is just using the qqe. nothing more. You would just trade every signal and hope you came out with a net gain in pips. this kind of trading has serious problems.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
what problems have you faced with this system ?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Nin when do you trade when the red and green dot apears ? best regards

--- 帖子 #133 ---
This thread has alot of intrested if there is something whrong with the indicator is it possible to change it io another timeframe or another settings or reprogram it so it will be better ? best regards

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi Ninpostar, Thanks for the settings and just to let you know that I was more succesful in M5 TF than in M1 for both GBPUSD and EURUSD. Thanks again and keep up the good work Buen Suerte y gracias por su ayuda. Regards

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hey nipo me esta funcionando muy bien el sistema estoy con 380 pips y esperando el qqe para salir. Ahora estoy con las 6 mayores y usualmente 3 de esta paridades se mueven en sentido contrario de las otras 3. Cuando uno encuentra el sentido de las 6 se gana mucho. Ahora no se si es mejor trabajar con una sola paridad pero mas apalancado. Tu siempre te sales por la señal de qqe o te vas antes? saludos.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
si verás, suelo salirme cuando veo que ha alcanzado picos altos, y ves que retrocederá, pero siguiendo los cruzes tambien es rentable. Gracias!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
GPU/USD me dio muchos pips , pero cuendo se va encontra me quita entre 60 a 80 pips te pasa lo mismo? otra pregunta, cuanto tiempo estas usando esta estrategia? y hay algun dia en que saliste negativo?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Kudos to this nice system. But check out how it is being currently treated by the market. Maybe ninpojustu might have something to say.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
altezza hello! It is true that days like today when the price does not know where to go, we have some bad trade, but at the end of the day is always positive. I already say that this indicator is for use with a strategy that we have, I will use another mix of indicators, and thus be able to determine the best ofice.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I am psoting an indicator called colour stocastic and along with QQE is giving good result You can attach to any time frame by changing to any time frame I have gained around +250 pip by manual tradg I am using Time frame 5M

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Use SMA 5 and SMA 8 QQE Colour stochastic

--- 帖子 #142 ---
it is not a system. that's the problem. You are just trading one indicator. Based on that fact you can lose big. As i stated earlier, you would just hope you had a net gain at the end of the day, but you would have to trade every crossover hoping that you caught the big move. If it was a system there would be some other confirmation that would measure volatility so you wouldn't be trading in a side ways market. try 50 trades at least before you use real money. I think you will see what i mean.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Well I was able to trade for only about 3 hours today, initially I lost a few trades about 4 or 5 but this was because I was trying to mutate the system watching laguere , MACD and stuff. Finally I just followed the qqe dots .... its very simple buy on a blue dot, reverse your position on a red dot. Initially I took a few losses but I stuck to the system and soon enough the pips started rolling in ..... I did quite well considering today is a monday and the beginning of the month. I think you have to give it time and you should be profitable at the end of the day. Damn I'm excited about tomorrow ............. Mucho gracias nipostar ....... howz my spanish ?? heh heh P.S&gt; I do agree with the member who said we lose a lot of proft if we wait for the exit signal ..... we can think of a trail stop or something later but I'm still satisfied.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Interesting method. Especially with volatile pairs like Eu/yen. And why not not use a smoothing factor of 5 ? 60 seems a little risky to me. Please see attached chart. Any recommendations from your side ? Improvements or comments ?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Today i have win + - 800 pips (morning) but now i´m losing all of them. Hey Nipo. En un principio me estaba funcionando muy bien, pero ahora tengo solo malas entradas, imaginate que llegue a tener como 800 pips y ahora me quedan muy pocos de ellos. No se que pasaria si hubiese entrado despues de la mañana estaria en negativo. No se que pensar, como te ha ido a ti. Creo que la paridad USD/CHF es la peor. Estoy usando Eur/Usd , Gbp/usd, Aud/Usd , Usd/cad, Usd/chf , Usd/jpy Como ha sido tu dia? mas tarde pondre mi cuenta con los resultados. Saludos.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Well, I tried it and had your same results, altezza -- huge pips in the moring, and then gave them all back. I could have easily stopped at 100, 200, 300 pips etc, but wanted to give it a full try.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Well, I think that in order to ensure the pips would have to leave before the next q cross. But I maintain that with the Crusaders have just always positive. I usually when I notice that there is a steep rise, I close the transactions before the Contras. We could seek a filter to improve, aid comrades! Now this screen close by the notice that it has been a strong trend.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
This method needs a good exit strategy

--- 帖子 #149 ---
a trailing stop might be a simple solution, once you bring in additional indicators there will be no end to it

--- 帖子 #150 ---
to put a trailing stop , we must need a stop loss first, but how big?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hello, Anyone have a script with predermined sl tp and adjustable? I have seen this script in LFH simulator but it is just for the simulator proggie and locked. I thing it will go handy if we put the sl in auto and then locking the pips. Thank you B

--- 帖子 #152 ---
20 pips on 5 minutes on EJ. Will test it and try to gain 20 pips a day.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
First it appears that the charts nipo is posting, look very similar to mine (AFTER i change timeframes and go back to 1min. The QQ indicator won't be that nice and smooth unless your chart has been refreshed and then repainted. I watched it for 12 hours straight and never had a chart to look like yours unless I moved to another TF and then back again. Had one nice 140pip winner and then about 20 more trades for some serious negative pipage. It looks awesome after it repaints. Friday I could have racked in over 1500 pips had I traded it after the repaint lol. The only reason it has some nice wins is because it gets into a nice trend and then the pips start to fly. But then just about any indicator will give you wins like that. Problem is what to do with the slow/sideway times. Just my 2 cents anyway. Todd

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I cant figure this out alot of people say this strategy dont work but still the starter of this thread calims he gain alot of pips there must be something whrong, something that is misunderstand. best regards

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I Don´t know guys but i have ended with +100 pips for todaay, just 2 loses, i am filtering the system using Smoothing 30 which gives you muche less drawdown than the 60, and Fibonacci Retracements on longer timeframes, also i only traded the London and US sessions, seems good to me, there is no magic system in the forex world, all of them will lose at some point, but if we barely know what we are doing (some experience trading the markets), i think this is a great visual aid, and plus i like the smaller timeframe it works great on this volatile markets, thanks for sharing your system Nimpo, Tambien hablo español gracias hombre, todo por el bien de la comunidad, abrazos

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Sorry i forgot to say that i have traded only GBPUSD and EURJPY, this results are from a live Real account.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
if u guys don't want too many signal, try increasing the setting. Like, 60:30, 240:30 240:60 Play around with the setting to see which one give best result

--- 帖子 #158 ---
hey all, i am not saying that the system doesnt work but after reading todd's post regarding the repainting issue, i did some observing of my own and there is quite abit of repainting with the QQE, not sure if someone can fix this but you just got to be aware of this. try opening 2 charts with the QQE, keep one the same all the time (dont change TFs) and the other one switch between timeframes and then back, when you compare the two you will see what i mean

--- 帖子 #159 ---
it doesn't repaint as long as u don't switch the time frame. Keep it open and see for yourself how profitable at the end of your trading day. Only trade those pair which are volatile like EURJPY, GBPUSD, GBPJPY. I am using 60:30 setting

--- 帖子 #160 ---
what do you mean by 60:30?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
60 is the time frame 30 is smooth. Re paint. all MTF indicators adjust. You have a 60 min indicator on a 1 min chart. there will have to be 60 1 min bars before the indicator is fixed. dont forget it is looking at the 60 min chart not the 1 min. Mart

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Smooth 60 Time Frame 30. Trade using 1 min TF. Attachment is the indicator on EURJPY been open since Asia session today. Did not repaint since I never switch away the chart. If u notice sometimes there is 2 dots instead of 1 is becoz it doesn't repaint if u don't switch away the chart. If u make it repaint, u can never see 2 dots.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Smooth 60 Time Frame 30. Trade using 1 min TF. This is GBPUSD open since Asia. Try out different setting and let it open all day without switching it to other TF. Review the chart at the end of ur trading day to see if it's profitable or not. Don't trade on low volatility pair like EURCHF,EURGBP,USDJPY,USDCHF, etc, becoz it doesn't work that well.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Ok i get the picture so Nin do you update you chart with changing timeframe or are the chart unchanged all day on one timeframe only ? best regards

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hello! And if we create an EA, not being able to better be able to be more profitable? I would be operating and still continue to give positive results, I now try 30, 15.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Nin pls answear do you update you cvhart undeer the day or change timeframe or do you not ? also why do you need to change the settings if you have a strategy that work so great as you say it is ? best regards

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi guys, i have started testing every signal given, entering and exiting on every dot that appears, and the results for EJ, starting at 8:00 p.m NY time, and ending at 6:30 a.m NY time +185 pips. (We still have US Session to go but since it is election day maybe it won´t do much) Chart: 1M Smoothing: 60 Timeframe: 5 The system is profitable if you enter every single signal that gives, the bad thing is a fulltime job at the front of the screen Also the indicator doesn´t repaint once you start trading it, at the beggining switch timeframes between 5M, go back to 1M and there is no repaintings at all

--- 帖子 #168 ---
U don't have to be in front of the screen if there is EA to trade for u. I saw one EA made for this system but I think it was not coded correctly. I tired it and it didn't close the current trade if there is opposite signal. It just open trade for u when there is signal. If someone can modify it to open trade when there is signal and close current position and open new opposite position when there is opposite signal it would be great.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi, here's the modified version

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I was curios what QQE (Quantitative Qualitative Estimation) is and googled it. Maybe somebody is interested: 1) Create an exponential moving average of RSI; the periods (length) is user-defned, default value is 2. 2) Create the 14-period ATR indicator based on the EMA of RSI. 3) Create the 2 trailing stop lines 3a) fast trailing stop is the ATR smoothed with a 14-periods wilders() smoothing function that is multiplied by a factor of 2.618 3b) slow trailing stop is the ATR smoothing with a 14-periods wilders() smoothing function that is multiplied by a factor of 4.236 I am currently enjoying the 30 min : 60 smoothing settings on EUR/JPY. Traded live on a small account I am up around 200 pips. By the look of it, losers ain`t too big to swallow and rewards a nice. Thank you for sharing your ideas here guys. On a side note. And something to think about. I have my charts running on 2 different computers, same feed/account (IBFX live), same indicator + template. I noticed that there can be quite significant differences between both charts, if you open the charts at different times. Also signals can be early on one and late on the other. The longer the charts run on the MT started up last, the less the differences get. In fact after 40 min or so, the values still differ, but the pattern/distance looks the same. Might be just something we need to be aware of. Like starting up the charts an hour before we start trading the signals. Happy pip hunting! I hope it keeps collecting these nuggets...

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Boten, Thanks for the modified version. Is there a way to add SL option to this version? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Yes, but i'm not sure if this would still respect the original system rules. I will add those smoothing and timeframe params, so you can play around with them.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Bonten thank you very much, it would be nice to say and be able to play with the settings, Today was a good day to the system!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hello! A friend to me this past EA is fully configurable. Have understood if someone set it with good results, I'm also in it. We have to configure it, this deconfigure!

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thanks for your EA man, we really appreciated, i will start forward testing it, i have a good reason to use a Stop Loss, and that is because where i live i have constant internet breakouts, and that for me is a measure of security, i have been usin 100 pips SL on my trades and would be great if you can add a SL, thanks a lot, keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Nimpo a couple of questions: 1. Does the EA follow the original Rules (1Min Chart, 5Min TF, Smoothing 60) 2. Will it open the trades when every signal is given?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello Bonten, the EA doesn´t close the current trade and opens another on the opposite when the signal is given, it opens them correctly but the same trade turned around, gave the opposite signal (sell) and the buy kept open and no sell trade open, i am testing the 1.1 version EDIT: Well, now it has opened an opposite trade, but it did way too latelike 4 or 5 candles after the opposite signal was given EDIT:, Ok now the EA has opened a buy on AU, didn´t hit TP reversed opened a sell, and now i have both open, BUY and SELL, it should close the buy to open a sell.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
60 5 and 30 15 ..which is better???

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Today I do the test using QQE with a single line. smothig 5 TF 5 50 level Only then pulled out a gain in EURUSD 350pips of non-stop hitting! If you have someone able to configure the EA to work this way, and they can be tested. Thanks for your interest.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I took the qqe and changed it to 30/15 on a 5m chart. Added another qqe smoothing 5 with a 50 line. I only go long when the single qqe passes up throught the 50 line at the same time as the 2 line qqe crosses itself. They must cross at the same time or within a couple bars. Seems to keep me out of the crappy choppy areas a bit better. I'll keep an eye on it tonight to see just how well it performs. Kinda hard to open a chart and scroll back since the 2line qqe will repaint itself. Not sure how much the single qqe repaints yet.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
What TF is your second QQE?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
It's set by default to zero. I changed it to 5M and it doesn't change the chart at all. So not to sure what's up with that. By the way I exit when the single qqe crosses back to the other side of the 50 line. I only trade e/j. Like the quick movers and hate to sit for hours waiting for a move in price.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
What do you mean by single QQE -- do you mean you're not using the second line?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
test at 1m. smothing 5, tf 5 is very safe and no paint! and put the level 50!

--- 帖子 #185 ---
.............................................................

--- 帖子 #186 ---
No I added a 2nd qqe indicator in the same window. Not sure if it's the one that came with my mt4 platform or not. But the setting were already set with the 50 line.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Ninpo how exactly are you using that single qqe as a signal on that chart? thx, todd

--- 帖子 #188 ---
yes is a good entry! keeps you inside the trend until it ends! Look at the results it gives, not repaint. We can combine.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hi Guys, I can say that this system is very good, in ten minutes 22 pips..... So good. Good work ninpojutsu.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Does anybody know if there is an EA for QQE crossing? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi Nimpo, you didn´t answer what i asked you, does that QQE_EA going to open any trades?, or it just manages them, because mine hasn´t open any

--- 帖子 #192 ---
if there is to configure it! You put the sotp and take! if you have a good setup, do know!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
ninpojutsu -- Do you have instructions on the settings for this EA?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
So what is the latest system how do we get entry and exit signals now Nin? best regards

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hello, new version orderclose bug fixed and added smoothing and timeframe parameters.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Thnx for the modified EA. Will test it out. I was thinking that will it better if the EA can set to break even when it reaches +50 pips ? Something like a free trade ?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi Bonten, thank you for the EA. Btw, do you have an ea which will close/disable a working ea when account balance reached? for example, when my account balance has reached up by 2% then the EA will disable the working EA.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
60/5 on a 1min e/j chart is kicking butt right now! Up 120 pips right now. I tried using the single line as a filter, but it still caused me to get hit with an occasional 100 pip loss. I just hate taking such huge hits.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Back to the drawing board. 1st trade was +55 at the cross. Was up over 100 but gave it back. Then very next trade was a long and got stuck on that trade and lost the 55 and some. Right now looks like everything has gone flatlined. lol

--- 帖子 #200 ---
the smaller TF setting u use, the more signal it will give. Try to increase the TF setting to avoid buying and selling on the same trend. Btw, the new EA is working well. Right now i am testing 10 different setting with the EA and will see which gives better profit. Will review all the trades at the end of London session. The EA will trade once it cross and it doesn't wait for the candle to close. The original indicator wait for candle close before giving the dot. If it trade before the candle close, it might give the problem of "cross and uncross" on some of the trade. I think it would be better if the EA take the value of the close candle instead of current candle to prevent "cross and uncross" trade. Anyway, it's not a big problem since most of the time it doesn't uncross

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Saludos a todos, Desde la primera vez que Ninpo posteo los indicadores, no he podido descargarlos. He notado que los archivos que postean con la extension .ex4 no los puedo (o no se como) cargarlos en mis indicadores, sin embargo los indicadores que postean (cargan, upload) con la extension .mq4 si los puedo adicionar a mi lista. Podrian explicarme como cargar en mi MT4 los indicadores ex.4? Mil gracias a todos .. pense traducir al ingles mi preguynta ya que es un foro donde predomina este idioma, pero inmediatamente supe que seri aun fiasco!!! Algun colega latino que sepa manejar e, MT4 y me de una manito "please" jajaja. Saludos

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I think with 5 smoothing and 5 TF and 10 pips stoploss and move it with the price in your favor is profitable.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
wow. The indicator is doing it's magic now. When it start to trend, the profit is amazing

--- 帖子 #204 ---
what configuration? what pairs?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
The following is something that can be improve on the EA (1) The EA will trade once it cross and it doesn't wait for the candle to close. The original indicator wait for candle close before giving the dot. If it trade before the candle close, it might give the problem of "cross and uncross" on some of the trade. I think it would be better if the EA take the value of the close candle instead of current candle to prevent "cross and uncross" trade. (2) The EA operate well open/close position when signal is close by but when the buy and sell is far apart for couple of hours, it doesn't close the current position and it go on and buy/sell the new position. I think the EA should check for magic number for any current order and always close it before opening. There can always be only 1 trade at any one time for that magic number

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I have a weird situation in my fxpro platform since I attached the ea. There is other profit loss in a single order and other in the totals. http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/a...974/weird1.png

--- 帖子 #207 ---
forexisfx, the ea does wait for the cross to happen and opens trade only at the beginning of the new candle, check the code. However i'm not sure exactly what u mean when u said that there is a problem when crosses are far apart?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
If the EA try to close a trade and not successful, will it keep on closing it until it is close ?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
yes, but currently only if requote or price invalid or trade context busy...i guess those are the most common errors. But i can also make version which closes if "any" error occurs. Are u using version 1.2?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Alo alo, I am using ver 1.2 and babysitting the errors Cheers B

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hello Bonten, the EA was working like a charm, at the beggining, and for some reason opened two buys on AU (didn´t open a sell when was supposed to, and when the buy came across it buyed so i had two buys open), and then it just stopped opening trades, it didn´t open any of those beautiful sells from last night, in which manually i got almost 400 pips on my real account, i am not a programmer, i would love to help with this, but i can only tell the errors i see, maybe something wrong with the code, if you can fix this, this EA will be like printing money

--- 帖子 #212 ---
hello robby2007, please attach the log file here or pm me, the log is placed in the experts/logs folder, thanks. Also tell me the exact time when this problem occured. Still i'm not sure which version you're using.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Yes. V1.2. It seems that i don't have the same problem again. It happen only once. I guess maybe my mt4 is lagging at that time becoz i was opening over 10 copy of ur EA. Btw, thnx for the EA. Like what robby2007 said, it's like a ATM. The only time i can think of when the EA or for that matter the indicator doesn't work anymore is when it has very tight range.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hello! Bonten Thanks for your work! I think the best thing would be this: QQE SF5 TF5 have a level 50. When he was above level 50, QQE SF60 TF5 just buy and to sell it. I operate in this way is successful and safe! Notice in the QQE sf5 tf5 level 50, give some signals great! Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
may know what best setting for TF 4HR..?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
This indicator has many uses. U can combine with ur own system u are trading or u can use it by itself. It's best that u use the EA and test different setting out becoz u know what u need and what u want. I tried around 20 different setting, i think i am closer to getting what i need.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
hi ninpo i think QQE 60 5 is a good indi ,better than 5 5 or 30 5 ,if you put too much indi into your system ...that..not good.. the original is best ..what do you say ?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
For some reason it won´t let me attach anything i don´t know why

The HAS MTF seems like a good filter. When you get a cross on the QQE, confirm HAS 1M &amp; 5M are the same color.

Adicione dos niveles mas al QQE uno de 80 y otro de 20, la idea es que cuando la linea del QQE cruce nuevamente el nivel de 80 a la baja nos salimos de la operacion, se pierden menos pips que si esperamos el cruce nuevamente de las lineas del QQE.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Please provide the setting aside of which we are using, for QQE SF5 TF5 with a level 50, only a blue line! and only cross the line 50. We can combine very well!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
With sf5 and tf5 work best on EUR/JPY, i think

please give us a pic OK? thank u~

Using the modified version of the EA on 6 pairs today, the results were amazing. About $830 on a mini account(about 900 pips). This was done between 9:00 am gmt to 5:00 pm gmt. Anyone else on this?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Note the recent news: US elections

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Is that an actual EA that buys and sells automaticall? Those things scare the heck out of me.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
which EA ? 1.1 o 1.2 ? 60 5 or 30 15 or 5 5 ??

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Great results! but they have to find some sort of filter!

--- 帖子 #232 ---
please post de EA, same configuration?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
HI Wanhone Which are the pairs you traded with ea

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Yeah. That's an actual ea that buys and sells automatically.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
EA version :1.2. Setting: Smoothing: 30 Timeframe: 15

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Maybe it needs filters, i don't know about that. I just pulled up 6 pairs randomly and put the EA on them and left mt4 open from 9:00 am gmt to 5:00 pm gmt without checking. When it was 5:00 pm gmt, I closed all open positions and checked the account history. Lo and behold, $830 in profit.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
What's the meaning of 2 yellow signals above the same candle? thx, todd

--- 帖子 #238 ---
thank u Wahnone ~ hehehe... there just little different between 60 5 and 30 15 but it dosent metter ...looks all same ..like ATM ~~oh yeah by the way ...i also like your ss system ,maybe you can ...make a EA too~

--- 帖子 #239 ---
live??demo??

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Nice system. With low settings of the smoothing factor, like 5, one can achieve rather easily an 80% success rate. But to watch multiple pairs and on each position close partially positions and let the remainder run is pretty stressful. Also one is glued to the screen non-stop. Broker spreads also come into play. What were your experiences regarding the best smoothing factors for TF 1 min ? I prefer manual trading than using an EA - anybody having had several consecutive days of successful manual trading ?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi use MTP EA for trade management

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I don't know what's the best for u. U can try out 5,15,30,60,240

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Today is a good day to test this indicator. EURJPY has been very choppy and i think this is one of the worst situation u can get trading this indicator alone. However, it still can be profitable or maybe a small loss at the end of London session i think.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Very choppy this morning for EUYEN, GBPUSD, EUUSD. Unfortunaltely my broker has a spread of 4 points on EUYEN. Used to be 3. But on each of the above currency pairs there was one nice bullish upward movement this am, which brought in around 80 pips together. Just right after a couple losses during a sideways market. But which system wins in a sideways market ?????? Maybe to avoid multiple consecutive entries during a sideways market which result in negative pips - a higher smoothing is needed ?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Yes, Higher smooth will reduce the number of trades in choppy market. However, it increase the loss per trade.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi there, I've been following this thread from day 1, but I felt I had nothing to contribute being a newb in fx. So first a Thank You to Ninpo and Bonten for providing this method and EA. I've been using v1.2 on the EUR/USD pair and let it run on a demoaccount, but it managed to chop my account in half in the course of one night. I kept a close eye during the preceding day and saw several points on which I would have taken profit, but instead I just let it run. So, hearing others having good results, something must be off in my settings I guess. I used 30 sm / TF 15. @forexisfx, can you elaborate on your testsettings which provided the best results for you so far..? I would really like to compare settings and results. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #247 ---
dont worry ..let it be.. at last ..you ll see..heheeh

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I think is not ur setting that has problem. Is the pair u trade that is the problem. Try trading EURJPY / GBPUSD / GBPJPY I don't have any conclusion for my setting yet, there is still many setting on my platform that is doing almost the same results. The following is one of my setting. It's losing money from Asia till now btw. However, London session is not over yet.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Can you zoom in on the pic and post again ? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
if i zoom in u will only see a few trades. That's the best to see all the trades so far.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Can anybody show any profitable EA by backtest for this system?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
IMO, u can only trust for any EA: Believe only 20% of the out come of the back test Believe only 80% on forward demo test Believe 99% on micro lot live test Why 99% ? Becoz u can never trust EA 100%.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thanks, will try other pairs. Just to be clear, I wasn't looking for your definitive answer in which settings are the best. I was interested in finding out which settings you already tried and dismissed and which settings gave you the best results so far. Guess I have to find out for myself

--- 帖子 #254 ---
If u try it out urself, i bet within 1 day u will understand the indicator better than reading anything here.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
hey huys ,never ever argue about the setting, just use the original set 60 5 even the EA set ,put EA into your trade for a week ,let it be ok? at last ! u ll see what is ATM...

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Isn't it better to use 20 different setting (including original setting) on 20 EA and let it run for a week and see which one is better ?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hello, I am baby sitting the ea with nice results. I have noticed that it looses 5-10 min untill it give the order. The settings are SMOOTHING 60, TMF 5. Can I fix this in a way ? The moment the crossing happens in the next 10 -20 sec to enter the order.Not after minutes. Thank you B

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Does anyone have a list of witch pair that not follow another it is many pairs foloow some other and loooks similar ? best regards

Hello, How i can remove the error mesages from qqe or make them saw correct ? Thank you http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/a...agedisplay.png

EA v1.2 is bugged out. It has numerous orders opened at the same time Would appreciate help fixing this.

ea v1.2 work not well today, some QQE cross it dosent work ~~

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I think we shouldn't trade during big News day. Maybe that explain today's choppy market and indicator not working. Today. EUR and GBP interest rate decision. This Friday is also a no trade day. The biggest News event once every month, NFP

--- 帖子 #263 ---
yes yes...take a look guys~~every month ,like today and tomorrow ..we should have a rest and out trade...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Gbp/Usd today rather choppy: Trades from left to right: trade 1 - win 2 - loss 3 - loss 4 - win 5 - loss/ break-even 6 - loss 7 - win 8 - loss 9 - loss 10 - win 11 - loss 12 - loss As with almost all trading systems - 15 minutes before and after news are coming out - this system should not be traded or just through an ecn broker with fast execution.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Great i feel im ignored no one have answeard my last 5 post or so does that mean i can say anything in here, i mean if im ignored anyway .......................

--- 帖子 #266 ---
if there is really big News, IMO we shouldn't trade for the day at all since most of the time those days will have choppy market till the news is out.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Maybe u should check out T101 trading basket system for relationship of currency pairs. Here is the link http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=107119

Using a fixed stop loss with this system doesn´t seem necessary. Have a look at this screenshot, entry was sell, then it climbed up to 1.5997, meaning a loss of -28 pips, then position came back down and profit was about 89 pips positive. Seems the reverse signal will work better than an automatic stop loss. Or is anybody using a money management system like sl 15 pips tp 20 pips ?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I think TP will works better than a SL for this system. Don't set SL, only set TP

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks Forexisfx best regards

--- 帖子 #271 ---
The system does great if you can get through the choppy sessions. I'm using 5/5 for my settings on a 1m chart. Creates more trades but gets you in closer at the top and bottoms also. Just make sure you trade something that has nice movements such as e/j or u/j.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I'm currently combining this with another ea that locks in profits in predefined steps, i will see how it works and eventually will posts the results at the end of this week.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi Ninpo....my QQE look like repaint the past..i mean, when i shutdown metatrader and then turn back on, my QQE showing different pictures...So,it's make me confuse.because i can't make a backtest...may someone help me for this situation? tq

--- 帖子 #274 ---
If you do not use some kind of sl then your account will go bust sooner or later. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #275 ---
ninpo i hope this EA have a maximum stop loss , en ...the system is a good system ,but you know ..any thing gonna be happen in this market,hehe for our safe ...ok? thank you.. nobody want to bust by accident..

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi Bonten, I liked the first AE, so I'm curious for the next version. I will be pleased to give it a testdrive...

--- 帖子 #277 ---
The QQE is definetly repainting! Stefan

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Okay i will carry out that issue a little bit detailed. I'm using the 1 min tf with 5/15 settings. When i open another chart for the same pair and timeframe i get diffrent signals. When i close Metatrader and reopen it it shows complete different signals. Stefan

--- 帖子 #279 ---
If u read this thread, u would have know that this system do not use SL and exit when opposite signal occur.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
If you had read my post I indicated if you do not use a sl your account will go bust sooner or later which it will. Your post did not say to exit when opposite signal occurs so how are people to know that you are talking about items mentioned in the thread? You could have wrote you are using the exit strategy listed in the thread but you did not. So my statement still stands if you do not use a sl then your account will go bust sooner or later but if your exit according to the thread then that is your sl so in affect you do have a sl. FYI here is your post again where does it say you were following the exit strategy listed in the thread??

After another choppy morning in gmt+1 - I will test using a higher smoothing factor. Used 5/5 so far on the 1min chart. I guess the original settings 60/5 have been working for ninpojutsu for a longer time period. So, why not use his recommended settings. Also a higher smoothing factor is much less stressful when watching multiple pairs. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
The sys is a no no in ranging markets. It looses 3 times faster in comparison with the wins it makes when the market trends. EA is buggy and dangerous in live account. Trade only smooth pairs like euro pairs.Avoid gbp pairs too many false signials especially in the small tmf. Cheers B

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Please provide the configuration SF5 TF5 but with a level 50, and only this line QQE! Manually. Give very good result!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
What exactly do you mean by line QQE? Only buy when QQE above 50 line ? And vice versa ? Also, I do not believe in EAs. Everything so far with this trading method was manual trading.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Alo alo, You mean smoothing 50 ,time frame 5 ,but tradinfg in the 1 min manually? Thank you B

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hola Ninpo; ¿podrías adjuntar el nuevo template con la línea 50 y un gráfico ?. Gracias

That is! TomTom! Try this setting! Today in EURUSD lead generated 200pips! With this configuration can combine with more indicators, yourselves!

--- 帖子 #290 ---
That 5 5 50 strategy is not profitable either i just modified the EA and beacktested it, many losers, just few winners.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
try GMT 9:00--16:00 dont trade in asian market ,you ll see

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I have tried the EA for two days now. I don't leave it unattended because there is no SL, but have had great success just scalping for 10 pips a trade on GY,EY,GU. I know there is a lot more to be had, but with no SL I am too afraid to go for more, can almost always pick 10 pips up at the QQE cross. I am using settings of 30/5 on the 1 min chart. This EA looks like it would be perfect if a SL could be factored in as well as maybe a trailing stop feature. JMO.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
but ,i still think...60 5 and 30 15 are best...

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi guys, Very interesting system, but some things are unclear for me. The original QQE indicator (posted at the beginning of the thread) has only one line, and a red horizontal line in the middle. Is that the latest indicator, and if yes, how to use it? You are talking about different timeframes than the indicator setting. Does it mean you use e.g. a 15 min indicator on a 1 min timeframe? Why is it good? What are the green and grey dots on the chart? Do they mean indicator crossovers? If yes, why dont they appear at each crossover? Thanks

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Have you found out that you get much better trades during the busy hours? What pairs do you trade and why? Why do you trade the 1m chart and not the 5m chart? What is your view of using your system on much higher time frames like the 1hr and 4hr?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi nin thank you for bringing the QQE in smaller time frame I just used QQE alert yesterday on TF 5 minutes and it is doing wonder This amount of pip is enough for my living by not going to the boring office

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Greetings to all. I came across this thread yesterday and it's really a nice one. Many thanks to all that made it a success. Please i have a problem attaching the indicators/template to my mt4 platform. Once it is attached and the error message will appear and will also shut down the trading platform. Atached herewith is the error message.... could someone help me fix the problem? Please help. Ocean.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
MT4 + Vista = Failure. That's why I run XP.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I have a PC as well as a notebook, both run with Windows Vista and on each I use a MT4 account for several months already. No system failures yet. Must be some other reason.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I think you need to have admin/root privileges on vista to run some apps.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
there is no problem with your OS only upgrade to last version of MT (build 218)

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Today I let MT4 broker account run from 0700 to 1730 GMT+1. I observed GBP/USD, EU/YEN and EU/USD with your recommended settings on the 1min chart. Now I took screenshots of the entire time period for all 3 pairs. When I clicked on the indicator again, it repainted and I compared all the new signals with all screenshots. After the repaint, the signals were less and much better. So backtesting does not really work. If I may ask, how did you do today on trading these 3 pairs ? Did you use a specific exit strategy ? Thank you for any information.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
It looks like people has lost interest over this thread, well i just like to thank, because for me it has been very profitable lately, even the qqe repaints a little the signals are very similar, so the repainting doesn´t really matter, thanks Nimpo. Smoothing:30 Timeframe: 15 Chart: 5 Parece que la gente ha perdido interes por este thread, bueno a mi no me queda mas que agradecer por que para mi el sistema es bastante ganador, aunque el qqe se repinta un poco las señales son bastante similares o sea que no me importa, gracias Nimpo, gran sistema yo lo uso Smoothing:30 Timeframe: 15 Chart: 5M

--- 帖子 #304 ---
guys ,take look this , QQE 5 5 50 = MACD 5 34 5

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Maybe it will work but some including me have a hard time to trust the indicator when you cant backtest it because it repaints. best regards

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Yo don´t need to trust it, forward test it on demo and see if you like it

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hello Anybody still trading the original set-up ? Today would have been a good day for eu/usd, gbp/usd and eu/yen.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I am running settings of 5, 5 and yes, yesterday would have been a good day on the Euro which is the only pair I am trading. A bit choppy this morning but +18 pips so far today although that has been from 8 trades, and 20 pips per day would be plenty for me. Currently on an IBFX Demo account.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Not bad.... Are you taking profits rather quickly? Like + 10 pips and out ? Any stop loss system or just a recross ? I have been forward testing 60/5 settings and there are days which result in just a couple positive pips or break-even. But then there are days which make it up as soon as pairs start to trend.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Yes, just playing with SL's and TP's now. Some of these moves over the past couple of days have been quite small so there are two ways to go as I see it; Small TP (say 12) with a small SL (e.g. 10) or open out the SL (to say, 20) and go for slightly more pips. The R/R is not as high as most people suggest i.e 1:2 or 1:3 but there is no way we can predict how far each movement will travel anyhow. Part of the present problem seems to be spikes in the opposite direction to the trade that are nearly always enough to take out a small (e.g. 10 pip) SL so I will look at this over the next few days and widen the stops and TP to try to cope with this. I have also attached a RSI (RSI Dot indy from another FF thread) to my chart and I will take a look at that in relation to where the QQE cross occurs and in which direction it goes either side of the 50 level.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thank you for your information. Same exact here - a fixed stop loss never worked for me. Just taking quick profits. Or taking quick profits and letting remainder of position run up to the next QQE crossing. It feels awkward not to have a fixed sl or tp, against all money management rules actually. Think I will determine a set of rules, like tp 15 - 20 pips and exit other half of position when up 30 - 50 pips, depending on currency pair, and if second tp level is not reached exit on next QQE crossing. Sl next QQE crossing. Safety sl 50 pips in case of internet/ platform failure. Will report back how that went.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hello everyone, Thanks Ninpo and all of you guys for all the post made. I've been trying this system for a week now in GBBUSD and EURUSD, pretty good results with settings 5 - 5 TF 1 min but the opposite spikes in the last two days forced me to exit trades before next signal cross, and that cut me lots of profit. Could somebody relate or post last two days results with this nice system ? If there someone trying the setting proposed for a mate Smoothing:30 Timeframe: 15 Chart: 5 How is going on? One more time thanks. Hola a todos, he estado trabajando con este sistema desde hace una semana con buenos resultados pero los picos en sentido opuesto de los dos ultimos dias me asustan y me han hecho salir temprano de trades con mucho potencial. Como les ha ido a ustedes? han tenido cambios en la configuracion inicial 5 5? Alguien ha probado la configuracion propuesta por un compañero?

I've been testing just about every combination of settings. For the QQE 2 line cross over one min chart, i've tested; 1/1 5/1 15/1 30/1 60/1 5/5 15/5 30/5 60/5 5/15 15/15 30/15 60/15 NONE of those settings produced anything positive in a sideways market. And just about any setting will look good in a trending market. So how do we filter out the sideways market and still catch that last signal before the big run? I've eliminated the 2 line QQE completely and now am testing the QQE 1 line with the horizontal 50 line and looking for cross overs. Have narrowed everything down to one min chart 1/1 5/1 15/1 30/1 60/1. Having (1) as your TF for the indicator is the only way to prevent repainting. 60/1 seems to keep me out of the sideways for the most part. But I'm still trying to get in more towards the bottom for a long and top for a short. Which the 5/1 and 1/1 do much better at. But 1/1 is a bit jumpy and you surely will be trading ALOT more. But if the losses are small compared to the winning trades, then so be it. None of these settings worked very well with the e/u yesterday because e/u was making really nice oscillating moves and the 50 line cross kept happening exactly at the wrong time. Crossed for a long at the top and short at the bottom. GBP worked out quite well for those settings with a (1) for TF. No 5m chart worked out very well. I can't stand taking 50 60 70 pip losses, something I will not even consider. I think the currency you choose is important. What works for one, won't work for another. As a final note. Nearly all the settings that I've eliminated would have given you a profit eventually. I just can't be sitting at the computer 24 hrs a day taking 40 or 50 trades until I finally get that profit. At times the 1st hour would give me 100+ pips and other times I would have had to sit there trading like a maniac to finally come out 30 or 50+ after 50 trades. The trend versus sideways is the key.

I agree. Also using 60/5 on a 5min chart the indicator hardly repaints. Entries are very similar. Almost negligible difference. So basically, it is all about money management and some sort of approach on how to cut losses short and keep profits running. Maybe a momentum filter would do the trick ?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
check out the Eur/jpy this eveing, 500 pip move on the long side off 1 signal, i am using the uinderlying trend to confirm entrys and this has helped in sideways sessions, also wont trade it if qqe is crossing back and forth over the line, I am using a 3 position approach take 10-15 pips out 1/2 then take 10 -15 more out 1/4, then leave remaing 1/4 postion with 20 point trail stop and hard s/l at level of first exit i am using the 4 charts gbp/usd eur/usd eur/jpy and usd/jpy on 1 min time frames with 60 5 as the settings as per the original tried the other smoothing combinations and this works best for me, also only trading the european open for 90 mins and US Open for 60 mins and occasionaly the US close for 60 minutes

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Nice approach. How do you determine the underlying trend ? QQE direction on one higher timeframe ?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
mainly smas but also emas and upper time frames for overall direction of trend

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi, Can anybody tell how the QQE indicator works exactly? Or perhaps a link to the its definition? (I cannot find anything useful in Google ) I saw someone posted an image showing that MACD and QQE plots exactly the same curve. Then what is the difference between the two? Thanks

--- 帖子 #320 ---
confirm entry or exit with wpr wpr 30 green wpr 88 blue wpr 228 red wpr 288 white level -10 and level -90 and level -50 put these on chart and notice that price will reverse when wpr 30 hits level -10 or -90 a lot of the time for a strong move wait on the wpr 88 always exit when the wpr crosses the level line and starts to reverse. Use the white wpr to determine trend direction. When white crosses -50 up be looking for buys only. ( You can still take shorts but know that you are going against the trend and they will be short lived.) This seems to work on all time frames. I am just trying to figure out the best QQE setting for this. BOTTOM LINE: QQE above signal line wpr 288 above -50 wpr 30 rising above -10 and prev bar below -10 == a buy and a low risk trade /// opposite for a sell

--- 帖子 #321 ---
see post #170

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Nice work Todd. I have had a look at a few of those settings as well and can confirm that I have found the same, perhaps unsurprisingly. I don't feel many indicators anyway will work in a ranging market to be honest. I have found that the repainting is not much of an issue as long as one waits for the candle to close on the QQE cross as yesterday I took a cross mid-candle forming and it promptly uncrossed and resulted in a 10 pip loss. I am with you completely on the risk issue too, allowing the price to run 50 pips against one's position is a no-no as far as I am concerned. In fact this morning I now wait until 5 or 10 seconds at most before candle close before entering a trade to make certain that the QQE cross confirms.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Thanks tfrench. WPR = Williams Percent Range. Why those particular settings? You do not mention the WPR 228, what do you use this for when you already have the 288? Thanks TH.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I don´t take these trades, see attached screenshot. The second sell cross came after a violent move down, usually a rather late signal then, so I prefer to wait for the next signal and stay out of the market. Sometimes price turns around right after, causing a big loss and of course sometimes price continues in the correct direction. For me, just too much of a risk.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
hello thanks for your system. BTW may i suggest somethin? maybe we should combine this system with candle stick formation like shooting star, doji etc to make the entry. what do you people think?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Just to make sure I expressed myself correctly: in the screenshot above I only meant the third QQE cross signal. The previous 2 signals I would have taken.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Pretty sure that candle patterns have much less significance on the 1M TF and I still need to be convinced of their worth on higher time frames too - same for Fibonacci retracements, I have no faith in them either (imho). Whereas I have little confidence in the above (patterns and Fibs) I must say that placing an order around a pivot looks fraught with danger and I am looking to see if there is a safe distance from a pivot that one can safely and confidently, place a trade. I have a feeling that the market sentiment is the sole and only determining factor in price movements though and no amount of indicators, fibs or pivots on our charts ultimately makes any difference at all to where the price moves

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Agreed! Occurred just after 0800 GMT and maybe a time to take extra care? And always check the calendar for News Announcements prior to placing an order in the market - goes without saying?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
WPR = Williams Percent Range. Why those particular settings? I don't know. I got them someplace else and they seem to work. WPR 228 when the 228 is above 388 you can also be looking for longs even though both are above the -50 level ( It's not an exact science) you can also look at the ma 8 of the wpr 30 and take trades on that cross. But the purpose I was using it for was confirmation of direction and it's pretty good for knowing when to exit a trade ( when it runs out of steam, exit) even though the QQE still signals ok, I will wait on a return to a more favorable level and enter again with the trend.

Copied and pasted from another forum thread (fxfisherman) 1) Create an exponential moving average of RSI; the periods (length) is user-defned, default value is 2. 2) Create the 14-period ATR indicator based on the EMA of RSI. 3) Create the 2 trailing stop lines 3a) fast trailing stop is the ATR smoothed with a 14-periods wilders() smoothing function that is multiplied by a factor of 2.618 3b) slow trailing stop is the ATR smoothing with a 14-periods wilders() smoothing function that is multiplied by a factor of 4.236 Hope this helps you Arilou.

Thanks tfrench.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I put the indicator on my chart, with the levels -10 -50 and -90 But i can´t found or how i can set the lines 30 green, 88 blue, 228 red and 288 white. Can you post your template here to see or use it. Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Thanks for explaining. So if QQE is made of RSI-s and ATR-s, I wonder how is it possible that it resembles so much to MACD (not only resembles, practically identical). BTW, does anyone have positive live results with this sistem since? I also experienced the repainting issue, and it seems really serious. A dot can appear and disappear several times, until the higher timeframe candle closes. Yes I know that not switching the TF-s leaves the dots as they are, but then the dots are false. I entered a trade at a new dot on 1M TF, and the trend turned against me immediately and continued that way. When I switched to the 5M TF, and back again, the dot was not there any more, and the curve became smooth and perfect again, indicating the countertrend (that had been previously overriden by the false signal). So I really wonder if there is a way to use this system profitably. Or should I wait for the higher TF candle to close, before I believe any signal? But then what is the point in using it on a 1M TF? It would be simpler to use it on the same TF as the QQE period, no?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Why did you no take the third signal in hind sight it was the right call just wondering on your reasons at the time ?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Regarding the 3rd signal: that was too risky for me. I am using 60/1, this strategy works fine on nice slow moves upwards and downwards. But if there are 1 or 2 bars which are dramatically longer than the others - I would not enter, as many times there is a reversal right after. And if then QQE is giving a new entry signal - the loss can be too high. I just wait for the next signal.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
To Arilou Try out 60/1 settings. The signals are very similar to 60/5 and the dots do not repaint. Just take a currency pair twice and use both settings for one day. I mean forward testing. At the end of your trading period, you can compare the signals between 60/1 and 60/5.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I am using 60/1 - does not repaint and gives several good signals during 0800 - 1700 GMT+1. Of course, it is definitely not a holy grail. Also tried out 30/1 to get me into trades/ trends earlier but in a sideways market all profits accumulated disappear. Just have a look at Gbp/Usd from 1000-1230 GMT+1 and also 1430-1630 GMT+1 using 30/1. During such periods one may loose quite more often than winning, so I would generally recommend a higher smoothing factor.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Could you tell me if you use the strategy entering and leaving alone in the crossings or do you have an indicator to leave before? (excuse me, I don´t speak english)

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I do not wait for the next QQE cross signal to exit. Usually exit at +15 -20 pips. But really - losses can be so big and trading without a stop loss is not a good idea. Still have to perfect this trading strategy with some sort of filter.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I like your stenght indicator on the different timeframes in the top RH corner of your chart, (ema and MACD) is that posted anywhere on this site

--- 帖子 #341 ---
In general I must say I have had days with lots of positive pips using this strategy. Then trades with enormous losses. One day is excellent, the other not at all. I know when I enter a trade - that most likely and with high certainty I will be able to close the position within minutes with around +15 pips. But there is always the "fear" of a quick reveral resulting in a 30-40 pips loss. From the viewpoint of money management this approach doesn´t make any sense to me, as one should have AT LEAST an 80% - 90% success rate in order to come out with a profit. So for me, if I can not achieve some kind of consistency trading this strategy it will not be worthwile continuing with it. Unless I do find a "magical" filter to keep me out of bad trades......

--- 帖子 #342 ---
guys don't you think that trading only during certain hours will help lets say 1 h before the first session until 1 h after the last session? or those who tested it until now could tell as when ( in what interval ) the losing trades take place.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I think that the best operations are until the 12 m hour NY, in the afternoon although they can have good entrances there are false signs (excuse me my english)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Use only Eur/jpy and 5/5 configuration.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
QQI is based on rsi and especially rsi 8 and 50 level you can use RSI _LDOT indicator to determine better positions but only with MM you will have a successful trade today i was very busy ( i am going to married this thursday ) so i only take a few trade before afternoon only based on rsi8 or qqe but with MM and nothing else , all of systems can be profitable but when only you use a MM nothing else the attach file is a real account not a DEMO

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Good, can you please post your template and indicators to see it. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
i wrote that only rsi and money management nothing else ... so no need for template you only need a naked chart with rsi8 and 50 or 55 level in m1 time frame i attached rsi-Ldot

--- 帖子 #348 ---
tks tetis congrats btw and when things will be the worst possible may those moments be as bad as the moments you are currently living ( it is an old romanian saying )

--- 帖子 #350 ---
But your qqe setting is 5/5 60/1 ?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Very good Job Tetis !!! Thanks for post your acct. hystory, I've been reading this post for a while and trying the original setup with variable results. I've adjust my chart setup to QQE 60/1 and plotted the RSI L dot/ 8 periods in a 1M TF. Let see what happens, but backtesting looks very profitable if I confirm the entry with with 5m TF to avoid overesold and overbought levels. What do you think? Best wishes on your new married life !!! (Pacience) http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #352 ---
The QQE is an indicator, how you trade it in reference to the forex is the system. Your also incorrect about this kind of trading..lol...as you put it. This system is very profitable. I have made a lot of pips using this system with setting of 60:1. I also use the MTF HAS on my charts. For those that know how to use the indicator, I am attaching it here. Those traders that don't have experience with it, you can find a lot of good information on it on this forum and by doing a web search.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
thank you jerry I have told several times in this forum that don't overload your chart with indicators! when you want scalping time is the most important thing even 1/100 second to push the button ! so don't waste your time to looking the 5 minute chart or other pairs . put a good stop ( in 1 minute i found 30 pips not 1 pips up or down) after the order and your t/p very soon . 10 pips + spread is very good result and if the trade is in direction of market you can go after 10 pips but never breakeven the position try to learn that come out with profit even if it is 1 pip

--- 帖子 #354 ---
i told you i look at rsi -ldot that is similar to qqe and take my decision very soon

--- 帖子 #355 ---
and what are the entry rules? :O ( sorry if you already answered this one )

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi Tetis, Great results, you are a very good trader! I tried the original setup described in this thread, but with not much success It sometimes gives a lot of pips, but later the ranging periods are demolishing. I put up the RSI you suggested, but it did not help much either. Could you please give some hints how you use it, and also on money management? I think I have problems with it too How do you determine TP and SL? As I see, you closed several trades before they hit target or stop. Thanks, Arilou

--- 帖子 #357 ---
30 pips s/l is enough for scalping if you took a wrong direction it will go near 30 and came back near your entry you must close it very fast because it will hit you s/l a few minute don't feel sad to close a position with a few pips lose! and never wait for rebound of market this is MM very simple

--- 帖子 #358 ---
see this position that i took a few minutes ago i took it and its went to about 4 pips or 40$ profit but i was typing here and i didnt took my profit before the reverse but no matter if wouldn't see a fast reverse i will close it before s/l

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Curious to see a chart of yours. Care to post a screenshot of one pair ? Thank you very much if possible for you.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thank you. I was a bit late.......

--- 帖子 #361 ---
see the chart and read my last post about the price action If you were me you must closed the order very soon and uou can open an order later

--- 帖子 #362 ---
here is a RSI 8 indicator that place an arrow when the RSI move above 55 for buy and a sell for when it moves below 45... not mine, found it in another thread here.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
see this chart you will see that i have had 2 chances for close my position with less lose near 0 or 4 pips and i didnt close it like the beginners that wait for a magic action in market and the s/l have been broken! less profit or lose is very better than..... so try to learn for accepting that you took a wrong decision before its be too late and waste your time and also your money

--- 帖子 #364 ---
So if I understand it right, when you enter a trade, you expect it to go straight to the target, and if the market hesitates, if the price turns back a bit (even if still in profit), you close the trade before it turns finally against you?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
in scalping because you use bigger lots than ordinary systems you must save your deposit so yes if i see the market is changing i will took my profit and stay for another chance to enter

--- 帖子 #366 ---
this is another entry before news!

--- 帖子 #367 ---
and for this entry you used again only RSI?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
yes and also another trade too don't wait for a huge profit in scalping i mean a 100 pips in 1minute take even 1 pips is better than losing if i see price stoped on 50 level of rsi for a minute after i am in trade and start to waving i will go out with profit as soon as possible like the second position in the chart and re enter it again in new direction depend on rsi break

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Maybe this indicator helps. It keeps one out of wrong trades sometimes. Just check to see that colors do match. Example: red dots before and sell signal - ok to enter. Or buy signal comes and 2 dots later they changed from red to blue - then enter. I guess the only way this system could have worked out this morning, using 60/1, was to close half position right after 10-15 pips profit and then wait to see how price develops. Let me know if the indicator is helpful to you.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Check out the yellow sell signal at 10:53 am. Dots were blue, so I would have entered 6 bars later after close of candle with red dot. Still a loser, BUT much less of a loser.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
This is not a nipostar system. Very diferent

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Has anyone tried this system on higher timeframes yet ? Below screenshot of 5min tf eu/yen. Less trades of course - but starting at 0700GMT+1, german time, one would have had 3 signals, each one easily scalped with 20 pips + each. Guess I will move up to the 5min tf - less strenuous!

--- 帖子 #373 ---
To describe the use of the above indicator, here is another screenshot. Buy signal at 1600 GMT+1 (blue lower dot) - I would not enter until the nonlagdot-indicator also shows a blue dot on a closed candle. This helps in getting in at a better price. Not always - but in this case the position would have gone already almost 30 pips against us.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Another example of nonlagdot - indicator: See arrows on first 2 trades - one can enter trades immediately. 3rd trade - enter after first closed candle with a blue dot.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
please post the indicators..........Arrows or colored circules, how to use it?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Here is the indicator again - nonlagdots. Blue means buy and red means sell. So - if you have an alert, example buy, from the QQE indicator and the dot-indicator also shows at the same time to buy then you can enter. I posted a couple screenshots to show that using the dot-indicator as well might save you some pips and give you a better entry point. Also it helps to have smaller losses. Not always - but in many cases. ( there is no perfect indicator )

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Which is the configuration? I don´t me appear the big circles that indicate the sign (excuse me I don´t speak english)

--- 帖子 #378 ---
It is 60/5 on a 5min timeframe. QQE signals are also blue and red.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
but I don´t have the big circles (red and blue) only the smalls, the signal don't appear. TP and Stop?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Big circles are QQE signals. Same indicator from page 1. Sl and TP - that is up to you and your strategy. I prefer to take quick 15-20 pips with a stop loss of about 20 pips. 7 of 10 times you win with the qqe indicator, approximately.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
ok thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
For some strange reason, this thread is going in a different direction. This thread is about the Ninpostar Revolution System. If you have another system other than what the thread starter had in mind, please consider starting your own thread and let the Ninpostar Revolution system be the main topic on this thread. Your cooperation would be immensely appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Just a note to clarify something in case it gets misunderstood: the nonlag indicator i recommend is only the secondary indicator. Entry signals come from the QQE indicator.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Entry signal for Gbp/Usd 5 min chart (settings 60/5) this am. Entry 5 bars after blue QQE crossover signal. (if one uses nonlag indicator as well)

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Thanks bro. BTW how much SL n how the exit strategy u use? And about success ratio percentage? sorry if my english is bad.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Sl about 20 pips - exit around 15 pips and if i see market is moving steadily, then i exit half or more of position at first 15 pips+ and let the rest run further. This am took first 12 pips on gbp/yen(half position) and waited to see where price was going, price came down and i closed other half at +7 pips. (unfortunately price went up again right after.....could have made around 20 pips more........lol) But i think nobody gets the perfect entry and the maximim of exit.......

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I trade this system from 2:00am to 11:00am NY times using these four currency pairs, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY. I jump in and grab 10-15 pips each crossing if possible on the above 1M charts. Since there are many crossings, I trade this system until I obtain 120 pips which is not hard to do on a daily basis.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
CTGUY, Sounds great! I assume from your earlier post you are trading according to the original Ninpostar rules? Can you provide any helpful trading tips for use with this system? I want to emulate your success! Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hey there... I added the MTF HAS indicator to my charts which gives me a clear view of what is happening. I have made my 120 pips already today. Now waiting for the Big Dog System to start. I will pick up my pips on this system also. You can get the MTF HAS indicator from my previous post on this thread. I do stick to the original rules. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Can you tell us what do you look for on the MTF HAS?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
CTGUY, What settings are you using for QQE?

--- 帖子 #392 ---
i see in your pic attch there are yellow line. Is that a moving average? are u also consider your entry by using that line?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
CTGUY I downloaded the HAS indicator and only have all red bars. A setting needs to be changed? You have a template to share? Thx, Todd

--- 帖子 #394 ---
You can also use this MTF Has bar:

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hello, I have the same problem, only red bars. What is wrong? Thx Henri

--- 帖子 #396 ---
The best entries are in 1M, in 5M in 5m the entrance is later but it can take too. Add QQE 5 5 with levels 70 and 30 to reafirm tendency

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Bonton, Can you pl. add Stop loss parameter and functionality in your EA - NinpostarRevolution1.2.mq4 Since Takeprofit parameter and functionality is there but stoploss is missing. Hello, new version orderclose bug fixed and added smoothing and timeframe parameters. Attached Files http://www.forexfactory.com/images/attach/mq4.gif NinpostarRevolution1.2.mq4 (5.0 KB, 291 views)

--- 帖子 #398 ---
As stated, do a google search for the instructions. My interpretations of the MTF HAS may be slightly different from the original instructions. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #399 ---
60:1 my friend and I made a killing using the system today. Same with my Big Dog System that is in the Trading System Section.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Yellow lines are moving averages that I use to determine trend strength. The yellow lines are the EMA (closed) yellow in color, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 and 15...... total of 6 different emas to attach. If you wish, you can also add the EMA's (closed) red in color, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60 for longer trends.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
so how long you use this system ....... ?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hey Todd.... this is an excellent request. Here you go my friend.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
When this thread started up. I usually check out most new systems. I had a strong feeling that this one was one that would be really good.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I see only time will tell actually ;] what is your result for today using this sys if is not a secret

--- 帖子 #405 ---
over 250 pips using this system... over 200 using the the Big Dog System... with todays pic posted on the thread.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
CTGUY, so if i can conclude, you enter the trade when QQE give a signal and the Heiken Ashi also same with the direction of QQE signal. You exit when you get 10-15pips, NOT when QQE give another signal, am i right? Thanks CTGUY

--- 帖子 #407 ---
CTGUY, i need your suggestion about this position. How u consider to not open or open in this situation. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Thx much CTGUY. I also just today read the 'BigDog' thread and find it very informative and will begin to demo it very soon. Looks VERY promising. Also I can't seem to get the HAS indicator to do anything except red. Any ideas? thx again, Todd

--- 帖子 #409 ---
This is the same indicator. Works fine on my platform.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I enter the trade at the qqe crossing. If the trend is slow, I just grab 10-15 easy pips. If the trend is good, I will try to stay in it for the ride. It is up to the trader when they jump out. Original instructions are to jump out at crossing. I jump out when I see exhaustion in the trade. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I didn't jump in here because the trend was short and the yellow lines were separating nicely and the market made a correction. I knew that was only temporary. If the market doesn't make corrections now and then, the market would be a straight line either up or down for hours at a time. This was obviously not a news spike. Remember, it is always good to go in the direction of the 1H, 4H and daily trend directions to be on the safe side.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hey Todd... traders that traded the Big Dog on Wednesday got up to 200 pips easily on the system. It is a good system. If you look at the poll, around 40 people voted against the system. But if you look at their profiles, they are the ones that don't contribute and obviously don't know a pip from a rock.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
George, I think. The template you kindly posted uses the '4 TF Has Bar' indicator that calls the indicator 'Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed'. Some people may not have the 'Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed' indicator.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Here is the indicator.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Buenos dias - mucho gusto. Quite a thread you have started here! I am curious - are you still using your original settings of 60/5 on a 1min timeframe ? Are you having positive pips with your strategy EVERY day ? (I had good days and not so good days so far....) And are you always waiting for the next qqe signal to exit a position and enter a new position ? Or do you take profits sometimes ?

--- 帖子 #416 ---
well now I trade only 1M i use a custom indicator based on QQE Smoothing:60 TF:1, 6 ema (close) 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15 and MTF HAS gbpusd, usdjpy, eurusd, eurjpy i target 120 pips a day ( this is a must ) plus other pips if I have time i managed reach the target yesterday and today

--- 帖子 #417 ---
sorry I read it in a hurry i did not see the post refers to a specific person my bad

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Nice job ! Eu/usd and gbp/usd moved nicely. But i did bad on eu/yen - how did you do with eu/yen ?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
i got 27 pips on eurjpy that target of 120 pips is the total number of pips per day. so this would mean 30 pips per pair.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Are you always looking at the mtf has bar to see that you are in the same position as the 5minutes ? Regarding eu/yen: did you close your position every time you had a profit of about 20 pips ? (Curious as today, starting at 0700 german time up to now there are about 6 signals were price almost immediately turns against one´s position and one could have lost around 20 pips on each.)

--- 帖子 #421 ---
well I use for entry QQE 60:1 and the 6 emas and my target are 10 to 15 pips per trade now when I enter I look mainly to the 30 period on the MTF HAS and I try to trade on that direction i also wait a little longer when all 4 periods on the MTF HAS are aligned ( red or blue ) you should now that i prefer taking 10 trades of 10 pips that 2 of 50

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Thank you for your reply back...... Will see how i will incorporate the indicators to filter out bad trades better, like the one´s today on eu/yen.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
one thing I am very sure about now is that in scalping is almost impossible for an indicator to give you the perfect entry for me works best when I enter a trade at a particular level ( sup, res, ema ) having at least one of the indicators agree with what I am about to do and then any other indicator will be used only to sustain my prediction

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hai CTGUY, thanks for your reply. BTW can you explain how to determine strong or slow the trend. Thanks CTGUY

--- 帖子 #425 ---
dear friends: Thank you very much for you great systme. after several days test, i found some problems about the qqe indicator. we use the the qqe of 5 min in the 1 min chart. but if we compare the qqe in a 5 min chart. you may find it is totally different from each other. regards

--- 帖子 #426 ---
well what i think is that their is a bug that can not be fixed: 1) a 1 min chart creates a new value for QQE every 1 min 2) a 5 min chart creates a new value for QQE every 5 min ( corresponding to 5 values on the 1 min chart ) the only way the 2 outputs will be identical is if the 1 min chart could predict the future - by that i mean that it should now how will the current 5 min bar end and that will be a breakthrough if it happens i suggest s60 tf1

--- 帖子 #427 ---
dear loopyno: i want to know do you trade every cross in 1 min, how do you move the false signal

--- 帖子 #428 ---
well i created my own indicator that draws a line at the high or low of the last bar before the cross: if the cross is a buy it uses the high if it is a sell it uses the low if the price reacts to that line i trade the signal if not ... i listen to Richard Clayderman - Ballade Pour Adeline and than another important thing =&gt; when I reach 120 pips I usually stop but if I have some free time and I was right in most of my trades than I trade a little more

--- 帖子 #429 ---
can you post your indicator and some chart to see what you do? thanks a lot.

Hi Loopyno...thanks for share your indi...just want to ask you about your picture...Do you really trade with direction of M30?...Or you just take a trade when qqe cross and sup res broken?...thanks bro

--- 帖子 #432 ---
well to be honest i use MTF HAS for 3 things: 1) if MTF HAS 30min is red M15 blue M5 Blue and M1 is red =&gt; profitable setup ( I may stay in for many bars to come 10, 15 ... ) 2) Al 4 aligned =&gt; profitable setup ( I may stay in for many bars to come 10, 15 ... ) 3) the third reason I use it is to monitor a trade; if a trade is going in a different direction than I predicted on the 1M chart, I am not worried if the MTF HAS M30 is agreeing with me if the sup/res of the qqe does not produce any reaction i also trade near the previous high or low ( when I see a reaction ). This time I take small profits holding a trade for a few bars. With trades of 2 or 5 or 9 pips today I made again 126 pips

--- 帖子 #433 ---
If you find condition like this, what you expect?...and what will you do?...thanks

--- 帖子 #434 ---
personally nothing because the price is somewhere in the middle i would zoom out to see the previous support and if a buy reaction appears near that I would target 10 pips if you really want to do something i would sell for 5-10 pips

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Yes...you right...Few bar later, qqe cross down..and i made 18 pips..thanx

Loopyno, what do you mean by trading a reaction to your S&amp;R line? Do you mean you'll trade long if it crosses above it and short if crosses below -- or something different?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
i meant that after the line is created i enter if the price comes back to test the line as a conclusion I trade many of the bounces of the sup or res ( s&amp;r created by the qqe or from the previous bars )

--- 帖子 #448 ---
just use the original set 60 5 or 30 15 or 5 5 50level ,let the probability to give u pips...

the circles I have drawn are made by me in paint to make myself understood what you have to do is interpret they way the price reacts at that line 1) the first circle is an area were the price passed right through 2) the second one is the place where the price found resistance, it is were I consider entering

Do the QQE dots repaint after a cross is made and the candle closes on the 1 minute time frame if the indicator time frame is set to 30 minutes? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
yes sorry i know u did not want to hear this

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Loopyno, Can you tell me exactly what you are doing to get your results. Like time of day, how you are exiting trades and anything that you might think to be helpful.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
hi sprescott ok I will try to summarize my previous posts ===================================================== Entry a new sup/res qqe line is created and price comes back to test it ( attached is the indicator I use - it's settings are smoothing 60 tf 1 ) any other sup/res line you could see on the chart where the prices bounces ===================================================== !!! any other indicator is not so important ( I watch MTF HAS only to see what it says and not as a entry rule ) ===================================================== Principles trade GBPUSD, EURUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY my target is now 200 pips a day ( there are days like today when I do not have time to watch the charts - I made only 88 pips today ) I exit any trade at a profit level of 5 to 15 pips ( gbpusd and eurjpy even 20 pips ) not all my trades are winners let the market breath ( today for ex I had 5 positions on 4 pairs and a total of -200 pips at some point - I got out at +88 ) ===================================================== 2 aspects that might tell you the way I trade are: in a +3000 pips profit trade I will not take more than 20 pips because these trades are hard to find and when u find them they will only help you break even due to those previous trades when you waited too long to find the jackpot instead of 2 winning trades of 100pips or 4 winning trades of 50 pips i prefer 20 winning trades of 10 pips ok that's about it loopyno

--- 帖子 #457 ---
how about SL? thank u,and please give a MTF HAS ,thx

--- 帖子 #458 ---
i do not use sl because if I see the pirce going to the wrong direction ( for example I see this when price bounces of the support line, I enter a buy but then price comes back and breaks it ) I close the trade and trade in that direction about MTF HAS, I attached the one I use. I know some people had problems with it. Maybe this one works for all although I downloaded from here remember that I only use it to monitor my trades

--- 帖子 #459 ---
OK THX ,show me some pic ,thank u ,entry example ,thank u

--- 帖子 #460 ---
if price comes back and breaks it ...little breaks..you'll cancel this trade ,right?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
if I sse a fuzzy zone near the line I trade the channel break

--- 帖子 #462 ---
loopnyo, i like the way you modified the qqe, but i see in the code that it uses the qqe_alert_v5 indicator values. Problem there is that only ###QQE_alert_v5 is shown in the indicator list no matter if i try to rename, download it again or anything else... double get_qqe(int mode, int idx) { return (iCustom( NULL, 0, "QQE_Alert_MTF_v5", 60, 1, So now i dont really know if the sup/res line is in the right place because i dont know where it gets its values. Maybe you could post some charts to verify.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
ok the indicator I use is based on the qqe indicator that started this thread the settings I use are smoothing 60 timeframe 1 I trade only on 1M timeframe ok my indicator looks for qqe crosses and does the following: if the signal is a buy, draws a line at the high oh the bar previous to the signal if the signal is a sell, draws a line at the low oh the bar previous to the signal hope this helps loopyno

--- 帖子 #464 ---
...............It sure did mine! Something is way wacki with this indy!!! IMO

--- 帖子 #465 ---
it works for me

--- 帖子 #466 ---
can anyone tell me if you have found this system to be successful

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Dear loopyno: I have a question about the qqe indicator. I want to see the history, but i noticed that the qqe do not have many day's history, so Could you please tell me how to adjust it. regards

--- 帖子 #468 ---
well can you work with MetaEditor? if yes the only thing you need to do is remove ObjectsDeleteAll() and in the start function add a while or for cycle to go "back in history" and check for qqe crosses

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Just about to return to this method - have had too much work! Plenty of good input from many but special thanks from me to Global Invest, CT Guy and loopyno. I will try the 60/1 settings and see what happens. Nice QQE support indy loopyno!

--- 帖子 #470 ---
hello Lopynno, cant you say me in that schedule trader? (excuse my english) (me podrias decir en que horario operas?)

--- 帖子 #471 ---
thanks i hope u have time to profit from it i was very busy and made only 190 pips today and yesterday instead of 400

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Does the NinpostarRevolution1.2 open more than 1 trade at a time ?, reason being i attached it to EURUSD and USDJPY. It opened a trade on EURUSD when lines crossed down but it didnt open a trade on USDJPY when lines crossed up ? Am i missing something ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Sorry but what were the indicators you used? Thanks

--- 帖子 #474 ---
only sup and res qqe

--- 帖子 #475 ---
lol i did not understand the English version of the question but I understood the Spanish one =)) and I do not speak Spanish i trade from 7am GMT until 7pm GMT 1 exception: if I do not have time very careful if I trade during news releases thanks, loopyno

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi loopyno What pairs do you trade?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi altezza.cl I trade GBPUSP, EURUSD, USDJPY and EURJPY

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Loopyno, If you can could you please post one of your charts? Thanks

--- 帖子 #479 ---
here u go it is from a few minutes ago on EURJPY but please remember that not all my trades are winners the first trade from the picture could have turned into a loser when the price wanted to test the support line i could have break even but I was inspired this time and held the trade a little longer ok! Romania will go to sleep now see u tomorrow boys and girls loopyno

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi loopyno, after all your post, now my question is already answered by your pic huahahahahah.... coz before this, i dont understand your system how to entry n exit huahhaah.... thanks loopyno.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
you are welcome

--- 帖子 #482 ---
i started running this system (NinpostarRevolution1.2) at 8.00am GMT on 6 currency pairs and am already -185.67. GBPUSD EURUSD GBPJPY USDJPY EURJPY EURGBP

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Thanksgiving Day in the U.S. today remember market not open there. Markets have been choppy with just a few clear trades as I see it. A day to take more caution or maybe leave altogether?

--- 帖子 #484 ---
i stopped trading usdjpy today

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hi loopyno. I have read all of your posts and I can see no reference to you using only Long trades when the QQE is above 50 line or only Short trades when the QQE is below the 50 line. So the question is, do you use the position of the QQE at all or not? I thought it may be useful to use it for additional filtering from the S&amp;R indicator? What are your thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Der loopyno: but can you provide a qqe in mq4 version. i can not modify a ex4 version indicator. thanks

--- 帖子 #487 ---
well i find that trading the sup and res from qqe or visual sup and res are very effective and I honestly do not want to filter them out because i only need about 10 pips which are easy to gain most of the time the most difficult thing for me right now is close a losing trade

--- 帖子 #488 ---
i most probably use the save ex4 file as you i am still looking for the mq4 version

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Has anyone actually back tested the Ninpostar Revolution 1.2 ? The results are horrific whatever currency pair you choose!!!

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Apart from the horrific backtest results i mentioned earlier, there is also a bug in the software which means that orders are not closed when they should be due to OrderClose error 138 which means requote. This seems rather strange considering RefreshRates() is used before the close statement. This could be why the backtest results are so bad. Again, is anyone actually using the NinpostarRevolution1.2 EA ??

--- 帖子 #491 ---
i do not use it

--- 帖子 #492 ---
i use it and the result is i loss.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I am not using it either in fact I would not consider using an EA as I have little faith in them. I suggest that you manually trade the method and forward test as loopyno and others are doing.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
who can tell me why???? how to fix it??

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi. Have you tried a reinstall of the indicator or downloading a fresh copy 00tomtom00 from the paperclip in the top right hand corner of this thread? Failing that, a new copy- maybe a reinstall of the MT4 may work.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hi Loopyno...May you check your PM?...thanks...

--- 帖子 #497 ---
[quote=loopyno;2368523][quote=00tomtom00;2368519] blue line crosses yellow line[/quot when QQE 60:1 cross up, while the white line (that indi you provide) shows downwards. what can we deal with this kind of situation? Loopyno regard

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Hi guys! woow like this thread has grown! I wanted to hang this EA if it can be configured to take advantage. I'm now using the QQE in SF 60 TF0 in 1M, guide me and other indicators for giving me this very good results! If you have someone you can configure the EA to make it work. I do not see how to activate it! A greeting!

--- 帖子 #499 ---
[quote=00tomtom00;2389841][quote=loopyno;2368523] hmmm I think there is something I did no understand in you post can you please upload a picture

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Amigos, para maximizar los pips que nos da las senales de corto o largo del QQE y no perder muchos pips esperando que el QQE nos de senal de salir de la posicion, he comprobado que los niveles fibonacci son super utiles. En los niveles fibonacci podemos: Salir del 100% de la posicion o cerrar un 50% de la posicion si vemos que la tendencia podria continuar en corto o largo hasta el siguiente o siguientes niveles. Esa es mi impresion a priori, la verdad soy nuevo en este tema y queda para su estudio esta opinion, espero nos sirva. Saludos,

--- 帖子 #501 ---
hi ninpojutsu i must say i am disappointed to hear you saying "I'm now using the QQE in SF 60 TF0 in 1M, guide me and other indicators for giving me this very good results!" since the thread is yours and many of us are doing tests on it and share a lot of things, why are u not doing the same. By that i mean that you gave me the impression that you said something like "I am doing great while you talk here, but I use a system different the I first proposed" without telling us what you are really doing i thought it is all about sharing loopyno

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Dude, MTF QQE with a SF 60 TF 5 on 1minute would equate to - 300 periods = 5 hours average QQE (like a 300 MA on 1minute) MTF QQE with a SF 60 TF 0 on 1minute would equate to - 60 periods = 1 hours average QQE (like a 60 MA on 1minute) Thats all

--- 帖子 #503 ---
ok you may be right but what does have to do with the fact that the creator of this thread is saying that he is using qqe and other indicators and nothing more that was my observation

--- 帖子 #504 ---
A good forex system developer is always trying to improve on his system, which ninpojutsu has done.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
You may want to invest in a translator program as most do.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
we all do but i do not think it's ok to start sharing just an indicator if you do share you should go all the way whatever ... nevermind

--- 帖子 #507 ---
its his system so it is up to him if he shares or stops sharing.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
What indicator are you talking about? Your posting sounded as if you were disappointed in his changing the settings. Please be more detailed so we can understand exact what your inquiring into. If you feel that your not seeing an indicator that you should see, you may want to PM the developer and ask for it and ask that he post a recent chart and with all indicators that he is using. This should help.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
i was disappointed because ninpojutsu said that he uses qqe and other indicators to get these very good results. I think that if he started sharing he should tell us what indicators he uses. it is his thread btw

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hello! I apologize to you for the lack of information I hit the wire. I start posting this thread but then I grow and be Shocked by all who are entering post. I now after a long work, able to show my settings! Just say that the improvements are to support the QQE, because only with this indicator can be disoriented! That is why we include some magnificent indicators that we are going to yield good results and is now the best configuration I've used so far! MY TEST AFTER MUCH TIME ON TRADE ME HAVE SAID THAT THE BEST TO OPERATE IN THE SHORT TERM IS FROM 5M TF, BUT WE DO TESTS!

--- 帖子 #511 ---
you know that we are here to help

--- 帖子 #512 ---
or maybe you too, in spanish! Nipo speak spanish

--- 帖子 #513 ---
lllooolll

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Loopyno is a wonderful asset to this thread and has a great point. Can you share your indicators, settings, currency pairs and a screenshot of this system as you now trade? Thanks a bunch

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Easy dude, is not necesary any investment ... it is for free, just...go to http://translate.google.com/translate_t ... Ctrl C + Ctrl V and ... you get some thing like this (faster and easier than post a reply) ... Friends, to maximize the pips and it gives us the signs of short or long the QQE and not lose many pips QQE we are waiting for the signal to get out of position, I noticed that the Fibonacci levels are super useful. In the Fibonacci levels can: Out of 100% of the position or close to 50% of the position if we see that the trend could continue in the short or long until the subsequent levels. That is my impression, a priori, I really am new to this issue and looks for this study reviews, I hope we serve. Greetings, (No creas que por todo hay que pagar, hay cosas que son gratis .. como los traductores !!!)

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hello, ninpojutsu Plz tell me, Is this the last template and indicators that on the first page of the topic? or I must to find updating indicators and template?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I don't need a translator. Put on your glasses, I am typing in ENGLISH. This is an English Forum... lol

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I guess he failed to understand that I was typing in English...Please excuse him....lol

Duh Dude... you can invest time into getting one, not necessarily money...LOL Actually, you should use it too!

--- 帖子 #520 ---
good call Dr G, if we didnt have all the noise this thread would not be 35 pages long, QQE is trading well this week for me on 60 and 1 also using your emas, had a great day trading monday european opening session. have just been runnign the E/USD set to 60/0 alongside the E/USD set to 60/1 and the 60 /1 seems to be more reliable, but thats just over the past two days

--- 帖子 #521 ---
so Ninpojutsu how much better are your results using 60 / 0 than 60/1 and would u let us know the indicators you are using for back up on decsions on when to take the qqe crossover, i ma havign sucess trading with the method and any updates from the thread starter woudl be most interesting http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif

--- 帖子 #522 ---
CTGUY ve a comprar un translator o buscan en google es gratis. Si respondes a esto es por que puedes hacerlo. No cuesta mucho, hay gente que habla más de un idioma y si alguien quiere hablar en su lengua nativa es problema de el. Si odias a la gente que maneja más de un idioma, solo me queda decirte APRENDE, toma el traductor, parte por eso. !VAMOS QUE SE PUEDE! Pongo esto por que si ven sus intervenciones hay mas de 10 donde constantemente le impone de mala forma el uso de traductores a otras personas que estan hablando en un lengua distinta al simple ingles. Pudiste usar el traductor de google? FELICIDADES!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
lets not get into petty digs, keep the thread focused onteh qqe system i have made 95 pips so far today with it g/u , u/j and e/u

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Thanks my friend, I am going to consider switching back over to your settings. Happy Holidays

--- 帖子 #525 ---
It is postings like this newbie posting that can turn a good system into a boring one. Look at the inactivity now.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi guys! Well, hang tomorrow and I'll explain the system to complete, to begin to discuss the results starting Monday. I've been doing a lot of evidence and I have added some last-minute indicator of when I was running at 95%! and I hope that with your help it improve in terms of the interpretation! I tried to do simple and visual, not to load it on many indicators, as almost everyone says the same thing, but it's amazing results and signals that we give. At the end I added 2 QQE! Well, we'll start tomorrow, Greetings!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
hi ninpojutsu nice to hear from u

--- 帖子 #528 ---
hm i`m not sure you talking truth show some proof? please

--- 帖子 #529 ---
just wait and see ...this month,hehehe by the way..the qqe set is original,i just add two ema...only use original qqe ,you can not win...

--- 帖子 #530 ---
will be very interested to see your modifications, i have been using loopynos support and res line and i do use the Emas as per CTguys post ands original settings on 4 pairs 60/1 or 60/0 and my own entry and exit strategies

--- 帖子 #531 ---
so will you tell us how and what you use exactly if this is not a problem

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hola Nipo, alguna novedad con las mejoras al sistema? saludos.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I guess you meant 'tomorrow NEXT WEEK' ????

--- 帖子 #534 ---
seems so

--- 帖子 #535 ---
What is the purpose of the Hieken candles? Thanks

--- 帖子 #536 ---
heiken ashi will give you early warning on trend changes, and you can use it as a exit signal. entry signal still use the dot indicators that ninpojutsu did.. hey dude, you rock! i just trade using this indi. got positive results, and amazing. not many indicators involved. cant wait your next release on the indic enhancement ninpo.. this indi is not repaint. i see it myselft. no need to worry i guess.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hi guys, I just started testing this system, and have not done well. Net losses so far. I'm looking forward to seeing the changes that ninpojutsu says he has made. In the meantime, I have an idea that may help improve your results. From the demo trades I placed over the last two days I am getting the sense that this system will work well when there are large, smooth swings of 30 pips or more on a pair. It will not be profitable when there are choppy, trendless days like we have recently had. Normally, around holidays and other times when the volatility is high or when there are few banks or big traders in the market, like now, the market either stays in a narrow trading range or chops wildly up and down without direction. During these conditions you will lose with this system, and it would be wise to avoid trading during these times. This system seems to achieve the same kind of results as a MA crossover system which is well known to produce loser after loser and result in steady drawdowns in your account. What you really need for this system is a way to be sure you are in a trending market before you use this. Exploring something like ADX may be useful, but here's another idea: The way I see it, with this system there are 3 options for entering the trade on a 1M TF: Entry at the beginning of a swing when you get the QQE signal. Entry after a QQE signal and a retracement that confirms the move is real. Entry after price breaks through a swing low/high after a signal, which also confirms the price action. What we have been doing is using option #1 above. As I mentioned, that works when things are trending well or having big swings, but kills you on choppy days. #3 is good, but I prefer #2. I am including two charts here describing variation #2: You watch the 5M TF for a signal then switch to the 1M TF and wait for a retracement and another signal in the same direction to confirm the 5M. That's when you enter. If you don't get the confirmation, you let it go. Look for another one. Pros do not chase markets. In other words, you are waiting for the move to start in earnest by seeing it on the 5M TF, but by then you have seen price move some -- and it may need to pull back a little and rest. You want the market to tell you it is either going to make a serious move in that direction, or if it's just giving you a "head fake" and will return to where it started. If it's real then there's no hurry to jump in because the move will be big, right? And if it keeps going, then so what? There's always another one. The other chart is the 1M with the details of entry/exit marked. If you look carefully at these charts and understand what the concept is, you will see how this can help to filter out some of the losing trades. And there are always more than enough of those to go around no matter how you do it. Since every setup is different, there is some judgement and experience necessary to decide if you should take the trade or not. For example, the first move that gives the signal may be too big, or the pullback may be too large, or maybe it occurs near the end of the day when there isn't much potential left for movement, etc. But those things are to be considered anyway by a good trader. You have to use it to learn it. I hope this helps you learn to be a better trader and to make more consistent profits from this system. Have a great holiday. Oh, and here's a little gift for you... You may find it amusing: It's a youtube video called "The Whipsaw Song" by trading legend Ed Seykota. Inserted Video Good luck trading, PistolDave

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Pistol, In your charts, you're using the M5 period QQE on the M1 chart -- was that your intent?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hi BenQ, Yes, that is the original idea, if I'm not mistaken. But here's another view of the same chart example on the M1 chart using the QQE M5 and the QQE M1 to give the entry signal. As I mentioned earlier, you watch the M5 chart for the first QQE crossover, the switch to the M1 chart for entry. I have the smoothing set to 5 on the QQE M1 to show a quick entry signal. I am throwing this idea out to see what everyone thinks and to see if it would help to eliminate some of the whipsaws without adding any more indicators. I just thought of something else that may help: If you are looking to go long, then don't take the M1 signal unless the lag is near the bottom (between 0 and .20). If you are looking to go short, then only take the M1 signal if the lag is near the top (between .80 and 1). This gives the trade room to move in the correct direction. If I'm on the wrong track with my thinking here, let me know.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Ninpojutsu excellent! Keep it up, your strategy every day is better. A greeting.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
How do you figure? If it was such a great strategy, Ninpojutsu would be here posting on the thread he started instead of teasing us with an occasional post and not following up.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I like the way you are setting up the two qqe indicatores on the 1 chart, agood way to confirm the trade direction u could in fact also add the HAS 4 timeframes to confirm upper tmeframe is trending in the direction of proposed trade fromm qqe crossover, but the point of this system is to keep it simple, agree with all the otehr factors that some dontconsider when critiquing this sytem like; times of the day to trade it and also to look for support and resistance levels as previously mentined i add the emas and Support and resistance from loopy no to assist in confirming the trade entry after the qqe crossover, i am using 60 and 0 settings. with some constructive discussions hopefully we can lure the starter of the thread back to see how his refinements are going and what he thinks of interpretations from contributors

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #382 ---
agreed it would be good to hear from Ninjo

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Are you still using this sytem? Ahora en nuestro idioma, seguis utilizando este sistema? Thanks Gracias

--- 帖子 #384 ---
First read post #537 to see the only "successful" way I have found for using this method. And I don't see that it is worth the trouble as there are better methods for catching a pullback than that. Here is an example of the problem you will run into using this: It's a typical day's chop. Red lines are shorts, green are longs. M1 chart. Using the M1 QQE on a M1 chart produced 10 trades. You had one 10 pip winner and one break even trade (if you were quick) and the rest were at least 10 pip losses. Looking at FXDD right now, the spread on GBP/JPY is 8 pips. So that is 18 x 8 = 144 pips in losses, 10 pip in gains. Net loss = 134 pips. And that is assuming you got in exactly at the right time, no slippage, no requote, etc. Using the M5 on a M1 chart kept you out of some of the chop, but was still a net loser with 4 trades losing about 35 pips. Not every day is like this one but unless you find a way to avoid these choppy periods you won't be around long. And there are lots of them. Solution anyone? I'm all ears. 'o'

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Now I understand Ninpojutsu know that your system fails and you do not write in the forum.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I have had good days with this simple strategy. However - lost it all the next bad choppy day. Not consistent - so quit using this indicator and strategy long time ago. It might work on higher timeframes, like a 4 hour chart, never tested though.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hello everyone and loopyno! Ive red all your posts and totally agree with your way of thinking. Im also scalp lover and want to understand your trade style So right now, im using res and sup QQE (your indi), sup res ( barry) and MTF HAS are attached on my M1 chart. Well, after i took bunch of trade with ur system, i got some questions regarding the entry rule. My trade style TP is 2 - 3 pips and SL is the biggest 9 pips ( 7 pips + 2 spread ) Currency pair / USDJPY I enter when the candle bounce/break the QQE line/ res sup as u said. Here is whats happened on my recent trades (over 300 times 50-100 times in a day). When after I OP, the price usually moves opposite direction or stop and come back OP point only after 1 - 2 pips move. So it was hard that the price over from OP n reaches to the TP area, and i had to cut my position a lot about 50% of these trades was SL. I only need 4 -5 pips move from OP. ( 2 - 3 pips profit + 2 spread ) I have 9 pips (biggest) till SL. ( - 7 pips + 2 spread ) The range between the SL and TP is just 9 - 13 pips. Therefore, each trade could be winner at reast I could OP at 3/5 upper/lower of the range. but i couldnt...... That mean, my entry is bad/wrong becuase about 50% of trades i had, the price moved against my op and reached to my SL area before it reched TP area. Plz help me to understand and get an idea how to use "Res and Sup QQE line" &amp; MTF HAS combination more useful.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Ninpojutsu, donde te metes kiyo? Vas mejorando el sistema o lo has abandonado?

--- 帖子 #389 ---
PAra perdio abandono!!!

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Any "system" based on M1 charts is doomed to failure. You're just trading market noise. I wouldn't look at anything under H4. Start with W1 then D1 then H4 - forget trying to trade short-term random market swings.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Dude ! Why the hell did you reactivate this damn old thread ? The last post was written 8 (!) years (!) ago - "jdcabona" and his/her cat has been around here 7 years ago ! Perhaps the cat was angry - the pet didn't like forex and enjoined jdcabona from trading !

Why would you reply a 10 year old thread?!
