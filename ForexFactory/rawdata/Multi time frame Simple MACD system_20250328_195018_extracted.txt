After going through lot of complex trading systems and indicators.. I have now using system which is very simple and seems to work well. so I am sharing the system here with everyone. Please provide your view point and maybe someone can help me automate this system. It uses only 1 indicator 3ColorMACD. 3 setting for the indicator on 4 hour chart 1) 12,26,9 2) 72,156,54 3) 360,780,270 3 setting for the indicator on Daily chart 1) 12,26,9 2) 60,130,45 3) 240,520,180 I trade it on 4 hours chart only. Buy when all 3 setting of 3colorMACD turns Green. Buy stop order on top of the trigger candle with stop at the other end of the candle. Target is same distance as Stop. so it's always 1:1 R:R. Stop move to breakeven when price moves half way to the target. on 4 hours chart, the MA is mapped to daily 200 MA position. so if that MA is within the RANGE (between Stoploss and profit target) of trade setup, skip the trade. Also if the trade profit traget is less than 25 pips, skip the trade. Currency Pair Exclusion List :- USDSGD AUDSGD EURGBP Update - 1st Sept - 2013.

Garfield &amp;5 interesting, can you post some chart? is this system only work for 4HR TF? did you ever try lower TF? THX

--- 帖子 #3 ---
welcome to glory hunters paradise

--- 帖子 #4 ---
thanks. I haven't tried this on lower TF as I don't trade lower than 4 hours due to noise and wipesaws. I am going to start trading this on daily TF from next month - sept 2013 as well as on 4 hours.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Here is a good example of GBPJPY 4 hours chart that I have a pending short trade open. Entry at low of trigger candle.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
GBPJPY Trade has triggered, now wait to see how long it takes to get to profit target of 75 Pips

--- 帖子 #7 ---
GBPJPY went in the right direction after london open. Moved trade to breakeven.. now just wait to hit TP..

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Garfield I don't know if you are doing this but selling and buying decisions should be considered where price is in relation to supply/demand and support/resistance levels. For example all your 3 indicators can have green on top of swing and you go long and get crashed. I just think mechanical signals specially lagging ones can't tell price Action.They are brilliant in past historical view but seldom accurate in real time. Regards

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hello All New to the thread. What broker platform are you using? Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Agree all indicators are lagging. as you can see with my example of this GBPJPY trade, it was in real time where I showed the entry and outcome of the trade. This system give me a fair number of postive trade, Risking 2% per trade, it is quite easy to make 10%-15% a month on this system without being too greedy.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I trade with 2 brokers - Axitrader and IBFX.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi, can you make up the past trades on the pics you put up? Thanks

--- 帖子 #13 ---
here are some example of winning trades.. let me know if you want to see few losing trades examples happy to post that too since there are always winners and losers in a trading strategy.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Well Done ! Continue, as long as it is profitable everything is accepted.....even lagging Continue...... Long time ago I used to trade a system very similar.....I used 2 macd's(and traded the direction of the cross).....you can see my trade explorer (Boomerang) it was VERY PROFITABLE..... The only reason I stopped was cause I discovered a better system....but it was profitable and a stepping stone for me.....

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thank you for this system &amp; congratulations to this new thread, garfield75 ! I manually tested it for 30 minutes using year 2013 EURUSD data with SL: 75 TP: 75. It's promising. And it's so easy to test! The 'stop entry on top/bottom' really does filter out lots of false trades.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
a few clarifications required: on the macd what are the settings for the following fields... ''count bars'', ''line'', and ''zero level'' ? even if all 3 colours match, do you still have to wait for the macd to go above the zero line (on the first shorter macd) for a buy, and vice versa for a sell ? even if all 3 colours match, do the bars on the macd have to be of certain size, length, because smaller bars dont really count right ? how many bars of a certain colour must there be first before you can take the next colour change as a valid colour change ? for example if you only have one red bar and then a green bar appears, surely that cannot ba a valid colour change ? when all 3 macd colours match, do you wait for that 4hr candle to close first and then enter on open of next 4 hr candle ? also, would it not be a good idea to enter on break of high / low of the signal candle ? ta

--- 帖子 #17 ---
''count bars'' = 1000 ''line'' = 2 ''zero level'' = 0.0 even if all 3 colours match, do you still have to wait for the macd to go above the zero line (on the first shorter macd) for a buy, and vice versa for a sell ? No even if all 3 colours match, do the bars on the macd have to be of certain size, length, because smaller bars dont really count right ? No how many bars of a certain colour must there be first before you can take the next colour change as a valid colour change ? for example if you only have one red bar and then a green bar appears, surely that cannot ba a valid colour change ? Just 1 at minimum, question then is - what about ranging market, Since my trader are set on top of bottom of the trigger candle and cancel automatically when the next 4 hour candle opens, I not experinced ranging issue yet on 4 hour chart. when all 3 macd colours match, do you wait for that 4hr candle to close first and then enter on open of next 4 hr candle ? also, would it not be dla good idea to enter on break of high / low of the signal candle ? Yes, Trades are setup on the close of the candle only, this way there is no issue with repainting. Entries are always on High/Low of the candle.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I may have missed it, but what currency pairs are you using for this strategy? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
How are your results, expectancy of pips per month?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
First, thanks for the system. I tested and when I used your template on my mt4, a moving average appeared and i don't know the meaning of it. Have it a meaning?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks for sharing garfield75. Took USDCAD today. TP hit. Currently short AUDUSD.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Doesnt this is maybe a little bit narrow minded? I mean for sure it is no bad idea, but why SHOULD it always be like this? If it works for you its great, but why should it work for everyone? By the way which Signal is not lagging? And garfield, great work. But have you ever evaluated what happens after hitting the TP? Maybe there is more to get by pyramiding out? Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
min scalp' hoss !! iam absolutely shocked to see you here ! you had dissapeared for the past few years, and now all of a sudden you turn up from no where ! i remember when i first started trading in 2009, the thread that you started ''eur/usd 1 min scalp '' fascinated me . but you were no longer active in that thread. i remember sending you message after message but got no no reply from you.. although i have moved on since and iam very profitable, iam still curious to know how well you did with your scalping method ? did it stand the test of time or did you lose everything later on...? do you still use it if not why not ? i remember you stated on the thread you were ''nailing '' those pips quite effortlessley ! and i thought you had made millions and retired . somewhere....? an honest reply would be appreciated..

--- 帖子 #24 ---
coming back to this thread, the macd indis deffinately repaint on the 1 hr so be very careful. i got 3 green bars showing a buy signal on all 3 macds. after entering a buy trade and an hour later all 3 of the same green bars turned red !! so it was failed and fake trade ! not sure about the 4hr repainting, as not traded the 4 hr yet. but if anyone else has had experience with 4hr repaints, please feel free to share your thoughts..... btw there appears to be a sell signal on audjpy 4hr.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
AUDUSD no sell signal for me yet as candle still not closed. MACD still green.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Nice system... What about TP and SL? Why you used 75 pips? Is the same for all pairs? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Lucariga, read post 1. SL is top/bottom of the candle. TP = range of the candle.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Great thread. After I looked at the 3 macd, I wondered if you ever tried it with 2. I'm going to give it a try on the shorter time frames. I'm going to set TP and SL with S&amp;R. If anyone wants I'll keep you posted. Again thanks. Sounds promising Gp

--- 帖子 #30 ---
nice work baoming... My aim is to keep the system simple and profitable. I don't trade lower than 4 hours, due to required screentime to monitor charts.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I trade all pairs currently.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Around 500 pips... However I measure my trading success in $ or % value not in pips. you can make 10% to 15% on this system per month following the rules of trading.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi carlostedo, Yes it does. on 4 hours chart, the MA is mapped to daily 200 MA position. so if that MA is within the RANGE (between Stoploss and profit target) of trade setup, I skip the trade.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Nice trades FBird, I missed them due to sleeptime .

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks seikilos. Yes I have toyed with the idea of pyramiding or opening multiple trades with different targets, haven't done much on it yet. it's definately on my to do list.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Just want to double check, did you wait for the candle to close on 1 hour before putting your trade on ? Yes there is a trade setup on AUDJPY 4 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi GP, 2 MACD will give you lot more trades, will also have higher number of losing trades, give it a go if you want, but PLEASE do it on DEMO.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Currently template settings are optimized for 4hours chart. As some of the traders are using lower timeframes to test this. I will post 30 min &amp; 1 hour templates. Will also post daily template for lazy traders like me, who can check the chart once a day and that's it. All templates will be available by end of this weekend. However I am only trading the 4 hours and daily chart.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I currently have 1 trade open on Daily chart for AUDSGD. Let's see how it turns out next week.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Garfield, I too have a weekend short on the AUDUSD... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi all, for setting stop loss and profit target, do you use high/low of the candle or open/high? thank you

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Nice trade. As the price has moved to more than half way to your target. Stop should be moved to breakeven to protect capital.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yep, will do Mon Oztime

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Nice and simple idea for a system. Quick questions.... What would you consider a fresh signal to avoid overtrading? Are we taking alternate signals? Do we have any ideas on an alert that pops up when all 3 macd's are the same color?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
A fresh signal is when a) there are no open trades on the currency pair or b) open trade stop is already at breakeven.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
AUDUSD Long trade has triggered.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Nice trade Garfield. This time was my turn to be asleep lol. Currently long USDCAD. Pending short on EU. EDIT: pending order cancelled.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Most of the JPY pairs will setup for long trades on the next candle.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi guys ! My UC trade was stopped out at BE. Currently short pending on EU. Potential set up on UY, but I don't like the 100 round number resistance above, so I decided to pass on that one.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
FBird - Which broker are you trading with ? As I trade this system on daily timeframe too.. My GBPCAD trade just closed with 150 pips of profit. I currently have 2 long trades open GBPJPY &amp; GBPCAD both on daily timeframe. No trades on 4 hours yet, there will be some when the current candle closes. Eur &amp; GBP are the 2 trades likely to be confirmed.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hey garfield, I'm very interested on daily TF cause of my 9-5 job. Do you trade the daily and 4H with same MACD settings? I'm visual backtesting this sistem on Daily, and I think is great. Anyway I generally obtain better results without trailing the stop to BE.... Maybe if someone can make an EA of this system we could fine tune the SL....

--- 帖子 #52 ---
GBPJPY long + 80 pips closed

--- 帖子 #53 ---
GBPCAD pin bars

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I trade on IBFX. 4H only.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Daily and 4h with different setting. Templates posted on 1st page. EA would be great for this system, dont have any idea on how to do it.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi, very simple system, that's good. Only two things to comment. First of all in the configuration paramenters for the macds, i don't know if there is a mistake in the third one or not: This is what you wrote in the first post: 3 setting for the indicator 1) 12,26,9 2) 72,156,54 3) 360,780,486 I imagine that the second macd is the macd for D1, (H4 parameters * 6), and the third macd is the macd for W1 (D1 parameters * 5). So, if this si correct, parameters for the third macd should be 360,780,270 instead of 360,780,486. I don't know if I'm correct or not.... The other thing that I want to comment is about trailing stop. I've seen that you just take the TP as the range of the triger candle, but maybe it would be better if we use a trailing stop once we are close to the TP and try to ride big trends.... It is just and idea, maybe you have tested it and it fails.....

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Maybe I missed it, but what would be the settings for daily time frame ?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Unfortunately I don't trade with MT4, so I'm unable to open the templates. Can you tell me the settings? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi garfield75 , thank you for share your TS. i want try this system with the Daily Time Frame, but i cannot find the template in the first post. Could you please add it, or share the settings? Thank you, have a nice day.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
This is H1 GJ chart. How do you manage this signal? Would you take this trade marked by red line?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
i believe this setup is for H4 and D1 timeframes. Re: post #1

--- 帖子 #62 ---
can anyone Make an Ea with this strategy ??

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi again, more questions about the system. I attach a graph to explain some trades and if there are some mistakes correct me please. I've done a very simple test from 5 august to now. I've made a total of 7 trades and I've not make a SL move to BE when we reach half the TP, and neither discard a trade if it is less than 25 pip TP. The only reason to do it this way is just to make some trades and see if I understand more or less how it goes.... Ok, the first doubt, for example after reaching TP in the first trade, do we enter inmediatly another trade as we have all three macds in green and we are no more in market?? Or do we need a transition from red to green or green to red to enter a new trade? Another doubt, do we skip a trade if the bar is a very big one, like the one that I mark in yellow (fourth trade), or that doesn't matter at all..... In this case we reach TP, but maybe sometimes if TP is very far away it's nearly imposible to reach..... Well, no more from now. In this case, if everything is correct we've had 4 winners and 3 losers.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Tradefish, you are right there was a error on the setting and I have updated #1 post now with correct setting. I haven't setting any trailing SL, due to limited time for trading, however if you find it to me more profitable, please share your result and point of view. Cheers

--- 帖子 #65 ---
i have posted the settings on #1 post

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I don't trade 1 hr chart, but that signal is valid. At the open of the next candle, you would put a buy stop on top(high) of the green candle, with stop below (low) of the candle, target equal distance to stoploss. Once triggered, move stop to breakeven when price is half way between entry and target.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
New trades are entered on the transition of red bar to green or green bar to trade. If you already have a trade open on the pair and it's not a breakeven, new trade signals should be ignored. No skipping trade based on big candles. Skip trade only of candle size is smaller than 25 pips. Also looking at the chart you have posted, 1) Third trade is not a valid entry as there were not transition from Red to Green. 2) Fifth trade entry is one candle late, also since you would have a open position already, whihc is not a breakeven, this trade should be skipped. 3) sixth trade entry should be at the high of the candle, therefore it wouldn't trigger and get cancelled after 4 hours. Hope that clears up few things on the trade. Cheers

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Garfield, This thread looks promising. I've been trading another MTF system but your system is certainly a lot easier to implement. So thank you for sharing. I do have one question: for each of the MACD charts, do we simply ignore the line running through the bars (from left to right - I presume this is the MA line) and simply read the colour of the vertical bars?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Thanks mact4. Please ignore white line running through....

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hello Garfield, I think your very promising method. Two questions please : 1 - For the stop loss and take profit, do you take into account the wicks of the trigger candle ? 2 - Also in post N°1, you talk of « Buy stop order ». Do you place an order conditional on the highest of the wick (or lowest of the wick) ? Thanks Best regards Oya

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Oya, 1) Yes. Wicks of the trigger candle is included. 2) Buy stop on the Highest of the wick and Sell stop on the lowest of the wick. cheers

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thanks garfield, Best regards Oya

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Here is a great example of EURNZD trades I am currently in 1st trade triggered early morning my time at 7 AM my time (Sydney). as it moved in the right direction, I managed to move my stop to breakeven. Then another trade entry was confirmed at the close of 4 hr candle at 3 PM, which I setup and it has triggers. Now it's just wait an watch game, till I can move my stop to breakeven for the second trade. Update - Both trades hit the profit target just before london open.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
are not trades valid entry as there were not transition from Green to Red ?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
sorry, I thought the white lines.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I've seen garfield's Daily settings on the 1st post: 3 setting for the indicator on Daily chart 1) 12,26,9 2) 60,130,45 3) 240,520,180 I've made some calculation, and I've noticed that the weeks on every month are 4,345 instead of 4 (365/7=52,143 weeks/year) --&gt; (52,143/12=4,345 week/month) So the Daily settings should be: 1) 12,26,9 (Day) 2) 60,130,45 (Week) --&gt; *4,345 and we obtain the monthly settings 3) 261,565,196 (Month) --&gt; signals are very different between this and 240,520,180 What you guys think?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
EURJPY - H4 yesterday

--- 帖子 #78 ---
EURUSD - Daily why last 3 signals are bad ?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
If that line above the price is the 200ema, I think neither of the last four entries are valid, as tne 200ema es between toy trade and your TP....

--- 帖子 #80 ---
not sure about your calculation here is how I calculate 12 (day) * 5 = 60 (week) as there are 5 trading days in a week. 12 (day) * 20 = 240 (month) as there are 20 trading days in a month on avg.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
you got that spot on.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
1) there is 200 MA in front, so these trades are skippable. however if you follow the rules and put buy stop at the top of the wick of the candle, none of the trades would have triggered on the next candle, after 24 hours all pending trades are cancelled on daily chart. hope that clarifies some of the rules.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Yes, my first assumption was wrong, what do you think about this one? I' think that the trading days on a month are 21 on avg and not 20. The calculation is: 365(day/year)/12(month)= 30,416 days in a month 30,416/7(days/week)=4,345 week in a month 4,345*5(trading days in a week)=21,726 trading days on a month... so more or less 22 If we want to consider some extra days of market close (christmas, etc...) I think we can use 21 instead of 20. What do you think garfield? (sorry for my poor english )

--- 帖子 #84 ---
thanks for reply

--- 帖子 #85 ---
not sure of 21 is going to make a big difference from 20. you can probably take to chart of same currency and do a back test to compare the result between 20 and 21.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Quite few trade triggered on close of candle at 7 PM my time. EURCAD short was a perfect trade in and out within same candle. I am currently long on GBPUSD and NZDJPY on 4 hour chart and GBPJPY and GBPCAD on daily chart.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi all. On my side, I opened 4 orders since yesterday: GBPAUD sell: stopped at BE. Badluck here as price stopped me out before plunging. EURGBP sell: stopped at BE GBPJPY buy: still opened with SL at BE. EURUSD short: currently in the red.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Sure.... I hope someone make an EA, so we can fine tune this nice system.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Ok, thanks for the answers garfield. I attach 3 more graphs. Two of them are trades taken today, one loser (UJ), one still open, now at BE (GU), and the third one is not a trade, it's only an example to make one question. In this last graph (AU), if we had entered where I point in the blue vertical line, we may have reached TP later, but if I understand the system, then there is no more trigger signal to reenter, as there is no change from red to green and we don't profit a beautifull uptrend.....

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hey guys, I've backtested 2013's EURUSD Daily and unfortunately this are the results: 2 Losses 7 Break Even 0 Wins Am I right or am I missing something? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hmmm, on my chart EMA200 is located on different place.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
The EUR chart you posted on post #78 has the MA in the right place. What did you change on your chart between then and now to show the MA on different place ? on daily chart, check you EMA setting it shoud be 200 and on 4 hours it should be 1200.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I did a quick back test 2 Positive 4 breakeven 2 loser

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I do use my discreation sometimes in taking or skipping trade. i.e as mention earlier by Fbird UJ was approaching 100 price, which is why I skipped that trade. I have a GU trade open which is at breakeven too, With AUD chart, we can only admire the uptrend in hindsight, since we can't predict the market, my system is aimed at more of a hit and run approach of taking money out of the market whenever there is an opportunity. I have had 2 EURNZD, 1 EURCAD &amp; 1 NZDJPY trades yesterday and all closed in profit. Can't complain on that result.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Which are the 2 positive? Can you post a chart so I can compare it with mine? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Here it is, White line = breakeven Red = Loss Green = Profit

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I do understand, relatively if trade is not trigered within next candle after (next 4 hours) the pending orders is cancelled....?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
that is correct!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
On a very first view I've seen that you dont include week end data (i.e. sunday data) in your monday candle as I do, in addition, I've seen that your 12.26.9 MACD is different from mine, maybe due to week end data... I'll retry without Sunday data and post as soon as possible.... In your opinion is correct to discard sunday data from charts? thanx

--- 帖子 #100 ---
My broker doesn't provide sunday data. So it was never part of my system.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Summing up my last trades: - GBYJPY: BE. - EURUSD: Loss - GBPUSD: currently at BE. No more trade today for me as tomorrow is NFP day.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
This is my settings of MA (daily templatefrom post No1)

--- 帖子 #103 ---
hello, thanks for sharing this strategy. Can I close the trade early? let's say after i enter a trade, without hitting my sl or tp or half of tp so i could move my sl to be, anyone of the three macd turned into opposite color after any candle closed after my entry, could i close the trade early?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi iwan73 You have it set to 200, I believe it should be set as 1200 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #105 ---
You can close the trade early if you want, but then you are reducing your R:R to less than 1:1. Which will impact your mindset when you take a string of losses in a row.

--- 帖子 #106 ---

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi garfield, I love this system but my backtests are not so good.... I've noticed that my MACD is different than your, and I think is due to the daily closing time of my broker (5pm New York). This is the 2013 backtest of GBP/USD 7 Losses 5 Break Even 4 Wins Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #108 ---
My backtest of GBPUSD shows 5 winners, 3 breakeven and 3 loser. Maybe you should download Axitrader demo MT4 platform and use their platfrom to confirm trade setups and then put them through your broker.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
You are wrong. For D1 timeframe MA =200. Look at post No. 92

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Iwan73, What sez first page..? " on 4 hours chart, the MA is mapped to daily 200 MA position." It means 200 on daily, 1200 on H4.. So looks like you are right! Powodzenia

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi iwan73 and Jackub I guess I should have clarified why it is 1200 instead of 200. Iwan, your chart shows a setting of 200, basic math says if the daily is a 200 then in order for the 4H to match the daily it has to be set at 1200 on the 4H chart. I will go back into my corner now and just observe instead of trying to help. I apologize for interfering.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi garfield75. Thank you for sharing your method, I believe it has a good chance of being able to help traders earn an income for the simplicity of it. I wish you the best with it. I took 2 trades using it and here are the charts and the portion of the trade statement that is relevant. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Is there someone who can backtest daily 2013 EURUSD and GBPUSD? My broker seems to produce more loosing trades than garfield's one, but I don't know why.... (I use FXCM )

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi lucaringa. At first I wasn't going to reply because of previous posters comments, I chose to reply to you because you seem genuinely interested in seeing someone elses view. I compared your chart from post #107 with my chart and these were my findings. I use FXDD because they have a candle close that coincides with the NY close, they also don't have that little useless Sunday candle which can mess with your moving averages on the daily and 4H charts. This is what I came up with. First 2 trades, I wouldn't have taken because price was hitting against a triple top(scroll to the left on your chart). If I did take them, they were both losers. Third trade: Breakeven: Fourth trade: Winner for me. Looking at you chart I think you moved it to Breakeven to quickly because price didn't move 50% to your target before you wnet to a breakeven setting. I think that is the basic rule of garfield's method, but don't hold me to it or else someone will accuse me of being wrong. Fifth trade: Winner I wouldn't have taken because I would still be in trade 4. I think you're 5th trade should have been marked as a winner on your chart and not as a breakeven. Sixth trade: Loser Seventh trade: Breakeven Eighth trade: Loser Ninth trade: Winner Tenth trade: Winner Eleventh trade: Loser I don't think I would have taken this trade because trade 10 closed in profit during this candle. Twelfth trade: Winner Thirteenth trade: Winner Fourteenth trade: Loser Fifteenth trade: Loser I would have hesitated on this trade because the setup candle was large and the take profit target would have been above the previous high. Not enough headroom for this to work out as a 1:1 Sixteenth trade: Breakeven Recap: 7 losers 3 Breakeven 6 Winners In my opinion, 3 of the losers could have been avoided by looking a little to the left on the chart to see where prior tops are located. If the profit target is located past the prior top or bottom I would reconsider taking the trade. I may not have noticed any posts by Garfield saying not to trade these setups, so it is based solely on my analysis and not the method outlined in this thread. 1greyfox

Hi lucariga I had some time available so I marked up the 2013 Daily EUR/USD chart like you asked. I didn't look for re-entries. I did mark where I either wouldn't take the trade or it was a questionable entry. I hope this is helpful to you. 1greyfox

Hi garfield75. I took a look at your 1 hour and 30 minutes templates and have these questions and observances. I see both templates are using a 1200 which is the same as what is on the 4 hour template. Shouldn't the ma's be set as follows to conform to the daily chart 200? 1 hour: 200 x 24 = 4800 30 minute: 200 x 48 = 9600 Also, on the 30 minute chart template the longest term MACD settings appear to be incorrect. I think it should be 576,1248,432 instead of what it is currently on your template. I updated my templates using a MTF moving average to show the daily ma location because MT4 appear not to like a setting of 4800 or 9600. I would like to send the indicator and updated templates to you but you don't have your PM set up. Please pm me if you are interested in receiving the items. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi Greyfox, Nice trades on CHFJPY &amp; AUDCHF. Lower TF don't have MA, as MA doesn't calculate correctly with setting of 4800 and 9600. Will have a look at the templates again to see what's incorrect. Cheers

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi garfield75 Thanks for the compliment, those were the first trades I took using your method and was happy with the results. The reason I brought up the ma's on the lower time frames is because when I downloaded the templates from the first post and loaded them up, they had a 1200 ma on each template, therefore, I thought that the ma's were meant to be used and they just weren't set to the correct settings. I also mentioned that there are mtf ma indicators that will add the daily ma on the lower time frame charts, but since they aren't required no sense in going any further on that topic. Have a great weekend. 1greyfox

There was a setting error on 30 min template. Thanks to 1GreyFox for pointing it out, I have updated correct 30 min template now. If you are using it please download the new template. I was not going to trade on Friday due to NFP, but gave into the template to take NZDUSD long trade, EURCAD Short &amp; CHFJPY Short. NZDUSD and EURCAD both closed in profit around NFP new release. CHFJPY hit my profit target, but didn't close the trade, I am assuming this is due to Wider spead during NFP. Anyway it at breakeven so no worries on that trade. In my opinion most profitable timeframe for this system is 4 hours chart. .... Have a great weekend !!!

--- 帖子 #120 ---
hi greyfox. Your help is welcomed. My chart is D1 and that is a reason why MA is set to 200.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hello Garfield, thanks for this trading system. I'm a new Forex trader here and have been trading the past few weeks based off what I know on charting. I'd like to try your technique but am having some technical trouble trying to figure out how to download from the first page and then get it to work in MetaTrader. Any assistance with this would be appreciated. Simply treat me like I know absolutely nothing at all (if you're willing to help) and it should work out. I use Chrome, download your file, then MetaTrader opens up, but my charts look nothing like yours. Do I need to manually plug in all the numbers by opening up 3 MACD's? I appreciate any help you choose to give. And I apologize if this is an interruption to your otherwise very interesting thread.

Good morning garfield75 Thank you for checking the template and making the necessary changes to it. I am glad to be of help when I can. I hope all the current users of the old 30 minute template see your post and download the corrected version. Congrats on the trades, I looked at my charts and have a good idea of where you entered and exited on each of them. At least the CHF/JPY is at breakeven, it would have been better to have closed at profit but a no lose situation is good also. Enjoy the weekend. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Thanks greyfox, I've seen that your MACD settings are very different from the one posted by garfield... Why? Unfortunately, with different settings we can't compare our results....

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thank you for the link, Swamp Donkey! I downloaded the indicator and couldn't get the 4 hour download part to work. Perhaps I was supposed to drop that into the indicator? Anyway, I changed it manually. This is what my screen looks like now. http://i44.tinypic.com/33xv3g3.jpg I put up the first indicator to show how I changed the numbers manually to match what Garfield wrote in the first post. Sorry for the trouble everyone. I hope I set them all up correctly. And thanks again Garfield!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Does this mean E of the EMA is for Exponential and the 1200 goes in the box that says, "Period"? under the Parameters tab? And it's applied to "Close"?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi lucariga. What a great catch you made. Those settings were for the 1h chart which I was working on and saved it as the daily template in error. I hate getting older. I was attempting to add multiple copies of the MACD indicator to the chart for each specific timeframe, this way instead of having several templates, the correct MA settings and MACD settings would appear when I just switch from the daily to 4h, 1h,etc. I have just made the changes back to what they should have been and will have to redo my chart analysis for you. Please give me a day or so to do the EUR/USD chart again. I will also re-check the GBP/USD as I can't remember if I analyzed that one before or after I messed up the template. Sorry for messing with your head. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I hope I'm not spamming your thread, Garfield. Here is my practice chart, first one anyway, I plan to do a second one with USDJPY. This is EURUSD 4H Attached Image (click to enlarge) My results, if I did this correct are. 1) No Entry (Meaning, the trade never goes off) 2) Not sure about this one. I think though that I get stopped out at even, but I'm not clear on my stops yet. 3) Assuming I'm stopped out at even money on #2, this one is an entry at 1.3324 and exit at 1.3399, which was the very top of that last wick there, very close! 4) This one is also a winner, if I understand my stops correctly. 5) No Entry 6) No Entry 7) In at 1.3252 and out at 1.3177 8) Should be stopped out Even if I understand my stops correctly. 9) No Entry So, if I'm doing this correctly, it looks like 3 wins 4 No Entry 2 Even Money No Losses Is this correct? Thanks for the help. As should be clear from the above, I'm not really sure how the stops are moved around. If you could clarify that, I'd appreciate it. I hope my 9 points are accurate.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I did USDJPY about the same time frame, and I'll post it if interested, but it looks a lot worse. Came out with 5 No Entry 3 Loss 2 Even 1 Win EDIT: Below is my chart Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Baggi I tried to view your screenshot but when I click on it, it takes me to the site where you uploaded it, even when I try to enlarge it, it is still to small for me to see it clearly. Would you consider just uploading it from your computer to the forum instead of using the outside source? 1greyfox

Done. Thanks for that! I didn't notice the option before. Looked for it, but obviously I didn't look hard enough.

3 setting for the indicator on 4 hour chart 1) 12,26,9 2) 72,156,54 3) 360,780,270 3 setting for the indicator on Daily chart 1) 12,26,9 2) 60,130,45 3) 240,520,180 Does anyone have the settings for the 1 hour chart?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
No problem at all greyfox... We'll copare our results. Take your time. This system could be profitable, but in a Daily TF I've noticed about 50% win rate at 1:1 R:R so break even at best (because of spread)... PS: Don't skip any trade because of triple top or other factors, just stick with the system so we can test it and maybe optimize it, don't let your discretion be part of this method.... Just my 0,02

Hi, What It would be interesting is a dashboard with 4 columns : currencies list - 30minutes - 1 hour - 4 hour - Daily In each time column a green signal appears when all the MACD are green. A red signal appears when all MACD are red. I am not programmer. Perhaps someone here can help us?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
from your screenshot, MACD settings looks correct.

Hi Baggi, your back testing look right. Moving stop to break when price moves half way to target.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Good morning Baggi. The settings for the 1 hour chart are as follows: 1. 12,26,9 2. 48,104,36 3. 288,624,216 After I replied to this post I made a chart which shows the various MACD settings for each time frame. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Good morning lucariga. I re-did the EUR/USD daily chart analysis for 2013 and here is the updated chart. I did this before reading your post about not adding discretion to whether I would take the trade or not. I added some additional comments to the screenshot which hopefully negated my reasons for not taking a trade. I also went over the GBP/USD chart and my notes which were posted in post #114 are correct as I did that before messing up my settings. So, if you remove my thoughts then it should be accurate(hopefully). EUR/USD results minus what I have marked as Trade 3 because I was unable to determine whether price moved up before triggering the short entry, or triggered the entry and then moved up hitting the stop loss. 2 - BE (Trade 3 not included) 7 - Wins 1 - Loser (Trade 3 not included) (the trade which I wouldn't have taken because of support being too close(Dark Violet vertical line) between Trade 6 and 7 on the chart). As always I may have missed an entry and maybe garfield75 could review the chart and add additional comments to what were additional trade entries. I am still in early learning mode for this method so mistakes can/will happen. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #141 ---
If I've not misunderstood, your candle close time is 5 pm New York (correct?) but our MACDs (expecially the 12,26,9) are very different... don't know why. Let's analyze your trades: 1) BE 2) Win 3) Trade to skip. The next candle never trigger it 4) Trade to skip. 200 EMA between SL and TP 5) Same as trade #4 6) Is a BE. Trade stopped at BE 2 candle after your green dotted vertical line Purple line) Is not a trade to take... MACDs didn't change color at all (always red) 7) Same as trades #4 and #5 8) Is a BE. Price didn't reach TP by very few pips, anyway BE 9) Trade not triggered. The very next candle didn't trigger it. No trade as #3 10) Win To summarize: 3 BE 2 Win 0 Loose This is my chart. Why are our MACDs so different? Look at the 12,26,9. Maybe your broker don't close the candle at 5pm NY? I didn't take your trade #2 because my MACD is red. 2 Loose 7 BE Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #142 ---
hi garfield75 when do you cancell your stop orders? if price touches sl before activing stop orders or when 4 hours lasts and stop position not active(in 4h trading)? (excuse for my english)

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi lucariga. One thing for sure, you know the trading rules better than I do. I forgot about not getting into the trade if it doesn't trigger on the next candle. FXDD does close at 5PM NY time. Have you looked into using FXCM 's MT4 platform for charting and place the orders on Marketscope? As to why the MACD's look different, I haven't a clue. I would think they would be consistent from platform to platform. If I am reading the longest term MACD correctly the histogram on my chart is below the zero line, while on yours it is above the zero line. That is very confusing. Anyway, it appears that I wasn't of much help because of my newbie rule mistakes, sorry for that. Maybe someone else who is using an MT4 broker other than FXDD which has a 5PM NY daily close would be able to post their chart for comparison. By looking at your results it is pretty obvious that using this method on your daily chart with isn't working well because of the differences in MACD between MT4 and Marketscope. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I have read all this topic and install indicators on my MT4, i am waiting for market, Once its open i will trade on demo account and will post my screens, Let see.....

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I manually put in the expiry date and time which cancels my stop orders automatically 5 min before open on the next 4 hour candle.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Nice work 1greyfox..

--- 帖子 #147 ---
garfield75 Thank you for the system.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Your welcome my friend. You might want to add the pic to your first post for those who prefer to set up their own charts. It could save time on people asking for the settings in the future. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #149 ---
On the 15 minute, I had a candle change color on me after getting the all green signal. Does this ever happen on the 4 hour? They were all green, then the top one changed from green to red.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Current candle can change color/repaint. That is why this system is based on close of a candle which elimates re-painting issue. Can u please confirm if it was current candle or 1 before current candle ?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
It was a current candle, not the one before. I haven't done this system "live" yet, just looked back. So my thinking was wrong. On the 15 minute, if it comes up all green, I have to wait for the close of the 15 minute all green before going in. Right? And it ended up going back to green. It didn't stay red, and I didn't make an entry.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
yes. you have to wait for the candle to close to confirm the signal for trade entry.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Is it a weird coincidence that the 15 minute and the hour have the same numbers for the first 6 settings?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
it is not a "Weird Coincidence". 1) 2nd set of number in 15 min represent 1 hour which is 4 times 15 min 2) 2nd set of number in 1 hour represent 4 hour which is 4 times 1 hour 3) Therefore multipling 1st set of numbers with 4 gives u 2nd set of number and is same for 15 min and 1 hour.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Let the trading week begin. I have a pending long on GBPUSD on daily chart. There are 3 setups on 4 hour chart at the close of 3 PM (AEST) candle. AUDJPY Long - skipping it due to 200 MA at the entry price. EURCAD Short- have a pending order for it. NZDUSD Long - not sure about this pair at this price, going to wait till london opens to see if I should put the pending long of just ignore it.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Bit of a newbie question here. If you can't monitor your trade, I know you can put in a stop loss in order to get out if it goes the wrong way. Suppose your trade is 50 pips and you buy at 150. You put in your stop loss at 100, can you put in a limit sell at 200 in case it reaches your target price while you're not monitoring? Therefore, you either make 50 pips, or lose 50 pips? Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I am not clear about your question on "can you put in a limit sell at 200 in case it reaches your target price ". When you enter a trade, your profit target and stop loss are already in place. so when u buy at 150. stop is set at 100 and target is set at 200.. so when the price reachs 200. the trade is automatically closed with profit.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
What I'm asking is, how is the trade automatically closed with profit? If you entered the trade through a buy, then you have to depart the trade via a sell. Do you put in a Sell Limit Order? I've never planned to exit a trade like that before. I've done stop loss before, so I'd go to Stop Loss and enter 100. But how do you enter the 200? Limit Sell?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
not sure what platform r u using, but in MT4, there is a Take profit value that is entered to close the trade automatically when it reachs the exit price for profit.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Good morning everyone. Good luck garfield75 on your GBP/USD long trade, according to how my 1 hour chart looks currently it appears you got triggered in your daily trade about an hour ago. I took a GBP/USD trade a few hours after the Sunday night open. 1 hour chart, manual entry instead of pending order. Target was reached while I slept. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Garfield, I am new here and I have lots of experience with automatic and semi-automatic systems, especially on FDAX which is not Forex, but..... I think your system is awesome and because it's not that difficult I like it very much. Because FDAX is also volatile which is almost normal with all Forex Pairs. I think this system will do also for FDAX and maybe other volatile indices. I want to try it also on Forex, GBP/USD and EUR/USD and maybe more. Do you have a favorable? Can you tell me something about your favorite pairs? And why do you use Daily MA 200 for skipping trades? What's better, 4H timeframe or Daily timeframe Thanks! Luvene

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi everyone. Here is a EUR/JPY trade I was in a few hours ago, this trade was taken on the 1 hour chart. Since this was a smaller time frame setup I decided to go for about a 1:2 Risk/Reward ratio instead of the normal 1:1 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I don't have any favorable pair, Trade all when setup is correct. 4H timeframe is the best in my opinion, I also trade daily, but you are free to try any other time frame that suits you. 80% of the time when price reaches 200 Daily MA, it tends to go sideways for little while, don't want to get caught in that. Therefore I avoid trades when price is close to 200 MA. Cheers

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Nice work 1greyfox. Do you trade 1 hour only ? is it during london or ny session ?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hi garfield75 I trade anywhere from the 15 minute through the daily charts. I like either the 1 hour or 4 hour the best as I have noticed the whipsaw action is less then on the smaller time frames. My trading day starts around 7AM NY time and will go to 10PM NY time. I look at charts throughout the day and if something looks good I'll jump in. I will take a break from 1PM -5PM NY time as the market just slows down too much for my liking. My main style of trading is MACD divergences and I came across your thread when I was searching for more MACD stuff. Your thread caught my attention because of the use of 3 MACD's and the simplicity of your method. I know I don't follow your rules to the letter but I believe that in order for any method to work, each trader has to make the method their own and it has to fit the traders personality. I find your method beneficial when I am not actively searching for divergences. How about you, would you be willing to share more about your trading style and how you developed this method? Thanks for asking about me and I look forward to being helpful here if I am able to. Have a great night. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hey 1GeryFox, Thanks for sharing your info. I trade mainly 4 hr chart. Since I live in sydney most action in the market happens in the evening (family time) or mid-night (sleep time) for me. Have trades lot of systems &amp; strategies, have learned that simple systems with black &amp; white rules and easy to follow them are better than overloaded indicators in the chart. True to my screenname, always trying to make a simple &amp; lazy system that I can follow and trade easily without much screentime. This system came about few months back, becuase I was trading a system with Fib, MA &amp; Stoch indi put together. Where all had to line up a certain way, which is confluence of multiple inidicator. Idea that struck me was what about mulitple timeframe coming together. so I tried my theory/idea with few difference indicators and MACD seems to be the most reliable and easy to follow without any grey area for rules. So far it's looking very promising, 1% to 2% a day in equity growth is achivable even trading 4 hr chart with minimum equity risk. Cheers Garfield75

Update on trades. Yesterday - 9th Sept Daily Chart Long on GBPUSD on 4 hour chart EURCAD hit my stoploss. NZDUSD - I skipped the trade. Should have taken it, turned out to be a winner Today - 10th Sept Daily Chart CADJPY Long trade entry. Stop already moved to breakeven. Freeroll NADJPY Long trade entry. Waiting to move stop to breakeven soon. GBPUSD long entry from 9th sept. Price close to entry point. on 4 hour chart GBPAUD Short entry - Winner NZDJPY Long entry - Winner AUDJPY Long entry - Winner AUDCHF Long entry - Skipped trade due to already open position in AUD. Didn't want to over expose to AUD.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
It is always worth emphasising that current bar that appears to change colour, as one is watching, to give the 3 same colour bars on each MACD signal must close before a position is entered. A lot will skip the detail and dive in. Yours is a simple but effective system that encourages novices to avoid cluttering charts with to many indicators. I have paper traded your system and 1 R:R is achievable on 4H. I am looking at how 1H behaves for possible safer entries. Have you considered catching some of the big moves using 1H?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi and good call. I had 132.5 as possible target (on paper) as it was a recent high of range. I have entered short from here to bottom of range with SL above May high.

Thanks!! Nope I haven't tried 1 hr to catch big moves yet!!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
"Also if the trade profit traget is less than 25 pips, skip the trade." i guess this is for 4hr chart? the pips should be different when trading 15min and 30min and other time frames, right? do you have the number of pips for other time frames? and should we take the pairs' volatility into account? because some pairs' range are much bigger than others. Thanks!

Hi Garfield , would like to thank you for this interesting trading system , seems quite good, short time ive tried it on demo, I Have rather bad colour blindness and find it difficult to read the green and red lines on the macds, especially on the short lines ,ive changed the colour from green to blue and saved to a template but it always reverts back when reloading template, can you or someone advise on how to save the colour change please? I wish everyone all the best with this new system . Regards Peter

Good morning/evening garfield75 Thanks for sharing a little about yourself also, I think everyone who gets started in trading tries many different methods before finding one or two that match the traders personality. I like the results of your journey as you developed a method that fits not only your personality but also works within the time you have for trading. That is a great accomplishment. I have a good friend who lives in your neck of the woods. We meet up a few times a week on Skype and use a separate meeting room where we share charts and look for trade setups during the first few hours of the Asian session. This has helped both of us mature as traders, we benefit from each others thoughts about trade setups, and in hindsight the trades we had already taken. When you have someone to share your charts and do some analysis with it is amazing how much the other person sees that you miss when going over it yourself. On another subject, I looked at your post on trades that you are in or have closed already, CONGRATS! You have clearly shown that simple trend following methods can be profitable even using a 1:1 Risk/Reward. I your method because of the MACD use which coincides with my MACD divergence trading, so it is an addition to my method without having to learn a totally different trend trading style. Have a great day/night and happy pipping! 1greyfox

Hi BuySellDubai Thank you. I did notice the higher possible target when I was setting up the trade parameters and decided it was too far back in time since there were closer previous highs to get through first. I didn't want to break to many of the rules outlined by garfield75. If we use the core principal of the 3 MACD as outlined I think we can make small changes to meet our own style without violating the basic rules of this topic thread. I looked at some of the current EUR/JPY charts with garfield75's template attached and don't see a short setup at this time, so I guess your trade is based off of another method which might be considered off topic to the method being discussed here. I hope the trade succeeds for you. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi BuySellDubai It looks like a nice setup. What is your ma setting on this chart? I ask because my location for the daily 200 is in a different location. On either of our charts though it would have been a win if you are going for a 1:1 1greyfox

Sorry, my English is not my first language But I think you don't understand my Dutch I think it's really a great and simple system. I know a lot of systems and the mistakes many of us make. Using too many technical analysis in it. Most indicators are telling you the same. I understand the method for 95%. The only thing that I don't understand is that Garfield95 is trading on so many combinations at the same time on both 4H and Daily Charts.... You'd have a lot to keep an eye on it every 4 hours and also look at the Daily Charts at the same time. How many hours are you trading each day? Especially I mean this for the 4h Charts. You have to keep an eye on these ones every 4 hours. You must also sleep or do you put the alarm clock interim once? I live in The Netherlands in Europe and therefore I am more focused on EUROPEAN pairs and USD pairs and possibly Swiss Franc combinations. Maybe there is someone who can tell me what is a good combination? I mean if there is pretty much trading on it and low spreads and volatile..... And for example what are the best trading times for all pairs available? Maybe there is somewhere on the Internet a file which clarifies what are the best time to trade for each FOREX pair? I am also interested in NZD and CAD but less in JPY. Thanks again to Garfield95 and all the other ones especially 1Greyfox. Great job! Cheers Luvene

10 mins a day for daily charts as I look at that only once a day. 10 mins on charts every 4 hours. I only took at them at 7 AM, 11 AM, 3 PM, 7 PM my time. if I am awake I may look at 11 PM (maybe 1 or 2 days a week). I also have MT4 mobile on my samsung S4. so once I am in the trade, can set a alert to send me a notification when price reachs 50% of the target so I can move stop to breakeven from my phone. and I trade all pairs becuase I don't which onces will be winner and which won't. Si I just follow the rules to put trades on. Outcome is out of my control.

There are 7 pairs, which just confirmed trade setup for me on 11 PM 4 hours chart. AUDCHF - long CADCHF - long EURAUD - short EURCAD - short GBPAUD - short GBPCHF - long GBPNZD - short I am not taking any as it's time to sleep and I have had a great day in the market today. Happy trading everyone.

Hi orid. I changed the color to blue and added blue to name of it, so all you need to do is place it your expert indicator folder then take a few minutes to replace the original ones on the templates with this one and all should be good. Don't forget to change the MACD settings. Much success to you. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi luvene. Your welcome and I hope you find garfield75's method usable in your trading. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Thanks again greyfox very kind of you to alter that for me . setting up shortly peter

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi Garfield, I don't get it and it's very important that our charts matches with each other. When I look at your post #191 and I look at the trade or possible trade of GBPAUD I see in my chart that I got a signal to go short at my time in Europe at the candle from 16.00 - 20.00 yesterday which is yours from 00.00 - 04.00 today (10 september). I place an order to go short at the low of the candle where the signal has been generated at 1.7003. Please, I want to do it real good, maybe I don't understand something or maybe this is normal that we have some differences? What do you think? Thanks! Luvene

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi luvene. I know your question was for garfield75 and I hope you don't mind if I try to answer it by attaching a chart of the GBP/AUD 4 hour chart. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. I also noticed that you have the ma set to 200 on your 4 hour chart, the correct setting should be 1200 in order to match the location of the daily ma. I am including a pic of what the ma setting should be for the 4 hour chart to match the daily. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi 1Greyfox, thanks very much my friend. I was aware of the setting to 1200 MA I forgot to change it to 1200, I copied one Daily chart to this one, you can imagine that..... Thanks for explaining the differences between my chart and the charts on MT4. I will download MT4 but I am afraid that it will confuse me. On the other hand, the only thing I have to do is place the orders at my own broker without looking at my charts. First, I have to download MT4. Thanks again! Luvene

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi 1greyfox, sorry for bothering you again. I downloaded MT4 but when I want to use MACD's I do not get it as the way I want it. When I look at your charts it looks nice and it is MT4 or isn't it? Anyway, maybe you can help me. Maybe with a template or something like that. I think I missed something.... sorry for that but at the moment I can't do anything with MT4...

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi luvene. Glad to be of help. In regards to your previous post, I completely understand the copying of a chart from one time frame to another and forgetting to make all the changes needed. I have made that mistake way too much. You are correct, you use the MT4 for the setup but place the actual trade on your regular brokers platform without using a chart. Now, for this post. Yes, my chart is of MT4, if you go to the 1st post of this thread you will find that garfield75 has pre-made templates for the various time frames. He also posted the 3colormacd indicator you need. The indicator gets placed in your experts indicator folder. C rogram FilesYour Brokers MT4 nameexpertsindicators The templates get placed in the first template folder. C rogram FilesYour Brokers MT4 nametemplates Restart MT4 and then open a chart and apply the template to the chart and it should look garfield75 template. I hope this helps. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi orid. Your welcome. Changing the color was easy once I figured out how the indicator was coded, it took some trial and error but finally found the correct area to change the color. As to doing actual programming, oh boy! the world would be in trouble. Let me know if it is working properly. Take care. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #199 ---
works perfectly thankyou all setup ,. Now I just have to persuade all you nice people to change your macds to the new blue colour so I can read your charts more easily LOL! actually not a bad idea really stands out for me anyway. Btw Those templates on page one have the wrong settings I think.? I set all mine to the chart, also on page one hope thats correct. have a great day everyone , Orid

--- 帖子 #200 ---
just rechecked the templates . 4hr no. 3 mac is set to 360-780-486 chart says 360-780-270. 1hr n0. 2 mac set to 48-312-36 chart says 48-104-36. hope I got that right might explain a few discrepancies between peoples charts if they are not checking. have a good day . Orid Attached Image (click to enlarge) just a quick m15 trade on pivot tut tut ,just wanted to show off my colours

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Garfield , I just realized not sure if I should have posted that chart with the pivots , apologies if I did wrong ,wont happen again. It was a small win for the system 10 pips sticking to the rules . Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi Garfield95 and all others, Alright, I succeeded in installing MT4 with templates and MACD three color indicator Great trading platform for Forex I was wondering and this is a question for Garfield95 : how do you manage the quantity of all your positions so quick? I mean, I was reading somewhere that your stop-loss for each trade is no more than 2% of your trading money. I know the Money Management rules, this is a good one. When I look at a screen image of yours with a few positions I see that for each trade you have different quantities. I understand, but....... This has everything to do with 1. the value of the specific pair in relation to your own currency. 2. The size of the Bar where the signal was generated. It makes me very confusing. In the heat of the moment I don't want to calculate this first and than go in. I am too late I think I hope you understand what I mean. Please, can you, or somebody else, help me with this issue? Thanks, Luvene

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I use this site http://www.earnforex.com/position-size-calculator to do a quick calculation for trade size based on my account equity and pips size of the candle.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
no prob

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi, first of all, I do understand you will start with demo account, if not STRONGLY recommend to do so. As long as demo account is concerned do not boder of the trade size, take smaller position as possible and start calculate pips not dollars, for dollars time will come later. Try to made first 20 trades , and proof yourself that you are able to follow the rules, in this methodology rules are simple, never the less many of new traders have problem to folow them anyway. Check it for your own good... Its good to made number of backets, its save time to learn the rules, but do not lay to much on it, the, use them rather for training how to operate with MT4 and rules following. make journal of your trades, it is a must. MAke notes of everything what is connected with your trade, even your headache . Journal helps you to improove your trading let you know how you perform and where you are making mistakes. Becose you will make mistakes thats for sure. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #206 ---
hello all, thank you for the system garfield, it looks very nice. @luvene: unbelievable as it may sound, mt4 is displaying macd wrong. well, not wrong, but not in the traditional way, as everyone else does. the computation is not wrong. mt4 shows the signal line as a histogram and the ma as a line. this method uses the signal line. traditional way (all other platforms, books etc) is having a line for the signal, line for ma and the histogram shows the distance between the two lines. you may change your software to display the signal line as a histogram and discard other lines to match the mt4 macd. I am guessing mt4 cannot change now because of the shock they will produce to the mt4 users. cheers. aristides.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Aristid, a great shock indeed..... @Garfield95 : what do you think? Thanks! Luvene

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I have only used MT4 for trading all the time in last 5 years, except for 2 months when I tried our ninja trader, trade station and e-signal, went back to MT4 pretty quickly. Not sure if MACD display correctly or incorrectly. It works for me. it's a slow market today so far. EURUSD has generated a long signal on daily chart this morning. 7 PM candle close in 40 mins, might confirm it on 4 hours too..

--- 帖子 #209 ---
(clarification: this does not affect the method in any way, its just good to know if you're trying to reproduce it on different software)

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I'm long for yesterday's DAILY signals on EURUSD USDCHF USDJPY EURJPY Let's see...

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Garfield75 a question please, on the 4hr if the trade is not triggered on the candle after the setup candle do you always close the trade and look wait for another setup ? or if pa looks like it might trigger on second candle if macs are still all same colour, keep the order open presuming you check chart at close of the 4hr candle? . Hope this makes sense. regards orid

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Can we add sound alert with this system, When we have same color on all MACD?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
always close the trade and wait for another setup.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I don't know how to code, trying to find someone to code it for us!!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Cool. EURUSD/USDJPY/EURJPY all three have met the criteria for long setup. USDCHF had 200 MA near entry price.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
strange my charts agree with you on all except e /u which still shows all red on 2nd mac last ten bars?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Good morning orid. Colors are cool! The chart setting pic in post #1 shows the correct settings for each time frame, so the changes you made look to be correct. In order to help you see the charts better because of your color blindness, I am attaching a sample chart with a couple different shades of blue. Would you please let me know if the various colors of blue are easily seen by you? If this color combination is alright, I will change all my charts to this color scheme so you can view it more easily. If this is good for you, maybe garfield75 would grant permission for me to upload templates for each of the time frames so more people who have color blindness can use the pre-made templates instead of creating them from scratch. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi orid. Would you please post your chart so I can compare with mine? It could be due to when each broker closes their daily candle and that could account for the difference. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Yes you are right about USDCHF, but I'm entered anyway because of correlation. Why you don't apply the EMA to close price? Thanks

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Good morning lucariga. I can't answer the ema question but if the correlation you are referring to is with the EUR/USD, and you are long EUR/USD then I do believe you needed to short the USD/CHF instead of taking that long also. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Greyfox ,yes that's fine, and very good of you ,hope it doesnt' confuse people too much but i'm trying to work out why my macd seems to be slightly different to other peoples, checked settings theyre ok maybe we will get these little differences anyhow? regards Orid

--- 帖子 #222 ---
here we go Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #223 ---
and e/u not showing long on daily on middle macd excuse me these are the first charts ive posted still learning Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi orid. I am glad that my various shades of blue are ok for you. I will be making up a set of templates for my own use as I want you and others to benefit from what gets posted in this thread. The MACD differences is going to be a tough one to pin down because there are no standards among broker's as to spreads or even what the bid price is showing on a chart, because of this we have to live by the fact that we can only trade what we see on our own chart. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #225 ---
SL hit.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Thanks for the advice, but I meant another correlation that has nothing to do with this system. I finally solved my MACD problems and I'm now ready to test live this method....

--- 帖子 #227 ---
garfield75 nice simple approach to trading. 1greyfox you are doing a great job at answering questions. I have created an EA for this system and i have sent to garfield75 to see if the EA trades as it is supposed to. I didn't want to post an incomplete version and then get a raft of questions regarding differences between trades. As 1greyfox said different broker feeds mean differences in indicator values which will in turn change the trades the EA will take. Once garfield75 and i have ironed out any bugs i'll post it here for a wider audience to test. What i don't want is for the thread to get highjacked by the EA and the method to get swamped, the way so many threads on here end up fizzling out! Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #228 ---
thanks again 1greyfox , you are already showing you are going to be a great asset, here and Im sure everyone appreciates your efforts, I can only be a burden im afraid lots to learn ,. On this broker thing is it possible to recommend a broker demo or whatever to get all the charts matching , ? because for instance I have missed that e/u daily trade (which might be a good thing time will tell ) but its rather important we are all on exact wave length. Im in Australia so I can download axitrader au but is that different to axitrader us , what are you guys using please? All the best Orid

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Thanks in advance Mike

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi orid. No problem with the chart posting, soon it will be second nature to you. I am attaching a chart of the daily EUR/USD current active trade. I am shooting for a 1:2 R:R instead of 1:1 I will move the stop to BE+3 when price has moved 1:1 in my favor. I don't know why your 2nd MACD is still red. Also you seem to be missing the 200 on your daily chart. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi lucariga. Thanks for clearing up my thoughts about the correlation. That is great news about the MACD problems. I look forward to seeing some of your trade charts. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi Mike. Thank you for the compliment, I am still a newbie to this method myself but believe the best way to learn things is by helping others get started. The EA sounds like a nice idea, I for one prefer looking for the setups manually but would be interested in seeing if the EA will make life easier for spotting setups, not for actually triggering trades. Thank you for taking the time to develop it, I also hope it doesn't ruin the thread. May I send you a PM with a script request? 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi orid. Thank you for the kind words, they are much appreciated. I use FXDD because they have a NY close(5PM eastern) and they don't have that annoying little Sunday night open candle that some other brokers do. Maybe some of the other users can reply with more brokers that use the NY close. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi lucariga, Please look into currency pair correlations. EURUSD USDCHF - normally opposite. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Phew tried ibfx fxcm us sites still differ ,finally noticed your post about fxdd downloaded fxdd did the trick , give it a final check tomorrow after a full setup, off to bed now 1.00 am here what would I do without ya ? gnite all good luck Orid

--- 帖子 #236 ---
May I ask why in this situation you aim to 1:2 instead of the usual 1:1? Thanks

--- 帖子 #237 ---
This reply is based on my own experience and is not part of the garfield75 method outlined by him. Hi lucariga. This is one of the rules I break of garfield75 for this method and all methods I trade. Ever since I started trading I have always aimed for higher than 1:1 Risk/Reward on a trade. I basically look at it this way, when going for 1:1 you need to be correct at least 51% of the time to be above breakeven. When using a 1:2 you need to be correct only 34% of the time to be above breakeven. When price moves the 1:1 in my favor I always move my stop to breakeven+3 pips. If it comes back and hits it well I still made 3 pips, but if price continues and reaches my 1:2 level, I have doubled my profits compared to just reaching the 1:1 level. When I set up this trade and was working out the Risk/Reward potential, I noticed that when I drew the 2Reward line the target was still below the previous highs on the chart, so this has provided confidence in aiming for the 1:2 on this trade. As long as I can easily see at least a 1:1 Risk/Reward potential before reaching a previous high or low then I would take the trade. If the previous high or lows don't offer at least 1:1 I skip the trade. This thought pattern falls in line with garfield75 when he says if the entry stop loss distance and target are less than 1:1 because of the daily ema he skips the trade. I added in the use of previous highs or lows to determine if I take the trade or not. I have attached a current EUR/USD of the trade and I have moved my stop to BE+3 because price passed the 1:1 level(magenta colored dotted line). Now, I just wait and see where the price moves to. I hope this explanation was clear as sometimes I am not as clear as I think I am. Thanks for reading this little book of a reply. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #238 ---
1greyfox. u don't need my permission to upload templates with visual changes to help out other traders. As long as the system is not altered by adding additional indicators to crowd the chart !! we all know that is how a simple system dies a complex death

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I have alway used EMA on typical price. if u change the EMA from typical price to Close, you will notice it hardly moves on the chart, it may make a big difference when the value of the EMA is low number (10,20,30) but on high number it's not noticeable.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Thanks mike... Will start testing today on 4 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
yesterday was very quite for trading had some other commitments. GBPUSD long from monday was closed in profit of 120 pips yesterday during london session. Was out for dinner and couldn't take the long setup on EURUSD 4 hour chart during london session. Have a USDCHF pending short on daily chart. yesteday it bounched of 200 MA Daily and has confirmed a short setup

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi Garfield75 Here is my second attempt USDCAD 4H Short. Please let me know if I am on the right track.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
The setup and your entry as per the rule is correct. Now it's market's turn to make the decision.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hello garfield75 I waited for your permission because I didn't want to overstep the boundaries of participant(me) and thread originator(you). For the users of this thread who have color blindness, I remade the templates replacing the green colors with blue colors to hopefully make it easier for you to use this method for your trading. The daily template has the 200ema moving average The 4 hour template has the daily equivalent of the 200ema moving average(1200ema) The 1 hour, 30 minute, and 15 minute do not have any moving averages on them. I am also re-posting the 3colorMACD Blue.mq4 here just to keep it all organized in one place. The 3colorMACD Blue.mq4 is required to use these modified templates. I also changed the color of the order entry line from green to DeepSkyBlue I wish you all great success. 1greyfox

Hi everyone, I was just wondering and I am not 100% familiar with MT4 because I am using it now for only three days but..... When we have a signal, so all three MACD's green or red it would be great that we can get a sound-signal or even better a sound-signal and a pop-up or something like that. Is this possible. Maybe MT4 has already this feature but if not, maybe someone can create this? It helps a lot! Thanks, Luvene

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hi, As I told before I am not a FOREX trader but these strategy seems to me also very good for indices like FDAX, ES, NQ and Gold. Besides these four I am using it now for two FOREX pairs, EUR/USD and GBP/USD. So I have to watch 6 ones for 4h and 6 for Daily. That will do! I love this strategy. Thanks, Luvene

Hi lucariga , I'm probably wrong ,but shouldn't the USD/CHF still be pending ? Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Excellent work.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
close or wait ? what do you say ?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
sorry for asking a stupid question.. Where is your stoploss ?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Stop is same distance as Target. so it's always 1:1 R:R but why i dont know remove stop point

Yes, it is, but I'm refering to the one of september 10 that was not to take because of 200 EMA ...

Here is an indicator that checks for all 3 MACDs showing the same colour. I've "borrowed" the alert code from elsewhere so it may not be perfect yet but will check current bar if required or just on previous bar. It will Alert, playsound and send email if setup correctly in MT4. When you first put the indicator on a chart it may give the wrong message but after that it seems to work correctly. Hope this helps Regards Mike

Oh yes the long signal I see that now sorry bud . Orid

Yesssss anyway neither the short of yesterday is to be traded because of EMA

Mike, thanx but... Maybe a stupid question but in what Map should I place this file? Regards, Luvene

--- 帖子 #262 ---
This is an indicator so it goes in the same directory as 3colorMACD.mq4, as it uses this to generate signals. You then drag onto chart of interest and you will get a histogram at the bottom of the screen showing signals. Regards Mike.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi luvene. I agree with you, I believe a signal is a signal no matter what currency, index, CFD, Stock, etc you place this template on. The list is endless to the possibilities, only time and the amount of monitors you have hooked up limits what to watch. Much success to you. 1greyfox

Is long but worth a try.... I hope garfield fixes the EA soon, so we'll backtest faster...

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi Mike, You mean the signal, the arrow in the chart? Great! Of course a red one for Short and a green one for Long. But.... only when there is a new and fresh signal . The sound-signal as it is now generates always a sound on every situation there are three green ones or three red ones. I prefer only when there is only a new/fresh signal. It would be great if you or somebody else can make this for both signals, sounds and arrows

This is the 2013 backtest of DAILY AUDUSD: 1 loss 8 break even 1 win Total: 0 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hey garfield, help me. Is there anything I'm doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi lucariga I went through your charts including the AUD/USD chart you posted after these charts were posted. I am only attaching charts of the EUR/USD and GBP/USD as our results were slightly different. This may be caused by my breaking rules again, or it is something you may have just overlooked. My results on the USD/JPY, USD/CHF, and AUD/USD were the same. Garfield75 did say that he trades mostly the 4 hour chart, I think you are showing that the daily time frame may not be the best time frame to use. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #287 ---
USDJPY short trade on 4Hour yesterday was stopped out at breakeven. USDCHF short trade on daily chart was trigger.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Yep. I trade the 4 hour chart. I don't trade any timeframe lower than 4 hour chart. I am trading the daily chart, but daily chart I am using addition judgement to take or skip trade. example would be setup of long on EURJPY and USDJPY couple days back on daily chart. I skipped due to them being range bound on that timeframe.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi Garfield75. Thank you for your input about trading on the daily chart. I thought there had to be some judgment calls involved when deciding to take a trade or not, but since I don't recall you mentioning anything I was hesitant to comment too much. BTW, I am also short on the USD/CHF pair also. Lets get some pips! 1greyfox

Here is my trade result for September, live account trading with 1% risk per trade.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Usually the bigger the TF the better... So what are your additional rules for the daily TF? I will backtest with them Thanks

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Garfield75 Thanks for sharing your results, the winners definitely outshine the losers. Very nice! 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Rules still remain the same. It's do with the feel of the market, experience in trading and trying to pick additional information of the chart like ranging market, divergence, double/triple top, S/R areas etc. That's why it's judgement call in addition to trading rules for entry &amp; exit on daily chart.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I have connected the Mike's EA Demo account trade explorer to this thread. Every one can keep track of trades made by the EA and check their chart. I will test is for a week at least to make sure it's following all the rules before releasing to everyone. Thanks mike for putting in the effort. Cheers

Ok, thx. Why on the 4 hr you don't need to watch all of those things? I ask you because unfortunately I can't trade less than DAILY due to my job, and I wish your rules alone could be valid also on daily.... You said divergences, I've seen that grayfox trades divergences too, maybe that is the part I'm missing. How do you trade divergences? Thank you guys

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I do watch some of those clues on on 4 hours chart too, but due to lower TF and price momentum, more often then not the price goes in the direction of the trade to give profit. I have quite a few examples where price went only few pips beyond my profit and then retraced back. Without changing main topic of this thread, there are quite a few threads in FF on divergence, maybe you can PM 1greyfox and he will point you to right direction on learning how to spot and trade divergence. Which pairs are you planning to trade on daily chart ?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi lucariga The divergence trading method I use is a completely separate animal from the method presented here. Divergence trading deals mostly with counter-trend trading, the method here is more of a trend following method. I was drawn to garfield75's method because it offers a different way of finding trade opportunities while still being based on the MACD. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thanks everyone for adding graphics to the topic. With these examples it helps a lot checking if I do everything right. However I am not sure if I have the right time setting (synchronized with Atomic Clock) for the charts in MT4 in relation to the charts I see in this topic. As I told you I am living in Europe. I was reading somewhere that MT4 uses the time setting of New York time especially for 4h charts. It confuses me a lot. Is there anybody who clarify this to me in easy English

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi luvene. The reason you may not be seeing the same times on the charts posted here as your charts is because the time on your charts is linked directly to when your broker's day ends. If you want your charts to look similar to some posted here you would have to download an MT4 platform that uses a candle close that matches the NY session close. I use FXDD so that should get you started. The 4 hour chart can show the most differences because of its candle close time. Trying to sync times with atomic clock is over-complicating something that can be easily solved by using a different brokers charts for your setups and then just entering the trade with your regular broker. Keep it simple and trading can become enjoyable instead of a 'job'. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi 1Greyfox, Thanks again for as always quick response but why on the other hand should I use MT4 of FXDD? Alright, when I do so I have the same charts as most of us have in this topic with closing NY time but I wonder if this is better than mine with the closing time of my broker......? What do you think? The system is real good and my opinion is that whatever Broker you are using the results are more or less the same. I am looking forward as always to your reply. Keep up the good work! Thanks, Luvene

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi luvene. When I first entered the Forex world 5 years ago I was taught that the NY close was the accepted practice, so that is why I use a broker who follows that practice. I did use brokers whose daily candle close differed from NY, but finally concluded they were good only up a point, that point being I wouldn't use them for the 4 hour or Daily charts, only 1 hour or less because that matched up the best with everyone else's charts and trading. The other point that makes the NY close correct is that is when the swap fees are settled. If you got the impression that you should leave your broker, that was and is not my intent, I apologize. I understood your initial post with time synching to mean your were trying to match charts posted here to what you see on your MT4 charts. The only way they will match is if you use the same brokers MT4 as the person who is posting. In the final analysis, each of us can only trade what we see on our own charts. I do appreciate that you find my posts useful, even though at times I do take the long road to provide a short reply. Once again, I apologize if I wasn't clear and meant no harm. 1greyfox

Mike has updated and fixed some codes with EA. I will create a new demo account on monday and start the updated version on it. Fingers cross, we should be able to relese the EA by end of next week for everyone to test and use.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
hi Garfield 75, question please , you only use the macd,s to match up the colours? ive noticed Mikes Mtf indicator works without the mac d.s on the charts cleans the charts up. or do you use the three mac d., in other ways as well? hopefully not getting ahead of my self here. Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi garfield75, congrats on the system. Looks like a promising strategy. had a quick look and I will give it a go. Cheers and thanks for sharing.

Hi, pfff.............. I saw at 18.00 I've got a message....this means 18.00 my Time is 16.00 for the system.... very confusing..... I wish I have a broker with MT4 with the same timeserver as my own time, otherwise it's too much confusing...... I have a question and I hope I did well....it confuses me a lot. And I hope I make myself clear with this problem Look at the 4h chart. When you look at the chart you see the last Bar there is a time of 12.00. This means as I understood (!) the Bar begins at 12.00 and ends at 16.00. In that particular Bar I've got a signal to go Long, three green Bars, alright. I placed the order at 16.00. My thoughts was there is coming a new bar now but.................... at the moment I don't see a new Bar. Why is that? The time is after 16.00...... Does this mean that I have to wait until this current Bar is closed?????? Please help! Thanks, Luvene

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi luvene. The time zone differences are probably due to where your broker has their servers located, very often it will be different from your local time zone. If you drew that vertical line directly on the 4 hour chart and not a lower time frame chart and then switched the chart to the 4 hour chart, then you are correct that the candle opened at 12:00 and the next new candle should be open at 16:00 On the other hand, if you drew that vertical line on a 1 hour chart and then switched to the 4 hour time frame, then all that is known is that the 12:00 is located somewhere within that 4 hour time period. By now you are probably pulling your hair out screaming at me. My initial thought is since it is Friday and you are 6 hours ahead of where I am, could it possible that your broker has closed for the weekend and that is why the new candle didn't appear? Also, you do have to wait until the current candle has closed before setting up your order because the signal may change during the active candle. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi orid. I had the same thoughts as you so I added the MACD signal to the chart and scrolled back and the MACD signal indicator matched up with the 3MACD's on all the pairs I looked at. Unfortunately, a previous poster noticed that you would receive an alert with the opening of each new candle(I can't confirm that because I set the alert feature to false). I am attaching a couple of pics to show the settings of the MACD signal and also how I set the charts up for the 4 hour time frame. Now, it takes only a minute or two every 4 hours to see if a new signal bar has printed or not. no audible alert needed. You could also do this for the daily charts. just rename the profile differently than you dd for the 4 hour. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi 1Greyfox, no, that's not the case. Indeed, you are right that timeserver of my broker is 2 hours earlier than my time. The time now in MT4 is 18.22 and my time is 20.22...... It confuses me a lot but I can handle it. It would be better if I can find a broker with the same servertime as my own local time....... I understand that I have to wait until the current Bar is closed..... because of the different times I was confused. That seems normal...... Thanks again, I apappreciate! Luvene

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi Orid, I use the MACD's other ways to spot divergence too, so for me I need to have all 3 MACD's on the chart. Cheers

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi greyfox, Yes I also have alerts turned off , Lot Quicker to check now with Mikes great work, Looks like I will have to read up more on divergencies .so I can still use the macd to my advantage, and also not waste your good work on the colour change, Regards Pete

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thankyou Garfield ,Looks like I have a lot more reading to do. Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi 1Greyfox / Mike and others. Sorry, I don't get it, maybe because English is not my mother language. As I looked to the image of the settings of the signal I noticed that alertsOn is false But how do you get a signal when you do so? OK, I understand it works and that's the main thing. However, it would be great when you get only a message or signal when there is a fresh/new signal. As it is now every time when 3 MACD's matches with the same color you get a signal/message over and over again. I hope I've made my point. Maybe this is not possible but now when you are watching many pairs you get many messages every 4 hours... Cheers! Luvene Note : another interesting article http://www.metatrader4.com/forum/89 about changing time in Metatrader4. Unfortunately, you can't do this and that's the reason why I don't like MT4 unless all the other features are great.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi Luvene, with the setting: "alertsOn" you can choose if you want the alerts or not. if NOT: no alerts, you simply need to check the bar color every 4 hours. This is your "visual" job. if YES: you can set all the parameters below. if you want the "message alarm" ( pop-up window message), if you want the "sound alarm" ( sound ), or "email alert" ( if you want the email alert, you must configure your metatrader platform ). For finish "alertOnCurrent" means if you want also the alarm when the current bar changes color. ( this is not so good becaouse the current bar repaint, and you get a lot messages for nothing i think ). Have a nice day. quilin

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thanks Quilin, one last question : great remark "alertOnCurrent" Does this mean if I set it on false that I get a signal when the next Bar is going to open and so the previous Bar is closed with all three MACD's having the same color? That would be nice and much better I think

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Yes Luvene, that's perfect. bye.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi, Does anybody know MT4 Broker who are using the same time server as I have? I live in Holland, my time is UK Time + 1. Thanks! Luvene

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Good morning luvene. The reason I changed the alertsOn to false is because I only look at the charts once every 4 hours and it is easy enough to visually see if there is a color change or not. I read the posts at the link you provided and I got the impression that all that dealt with was changing the display to your local time instead of the broker server time. Even if that option was available, unless your broker chose to use NY session close for the daily candle(which affects mostly the 4 hour time frame) your charts would still look the same as they do now. If the time difference is bothering you that much you might be able to make a chart of some sort listing the time on MT4 and then next to it put your local time. This way when you look at the MT4 chart you then glance at your time sheet to what time it would have been. I am sorry I can't offer any more thoughts on this topic to help you. Thank you garfiield75 for your patience with this 'time' topic in order to help a fellow user, but now I think it is heading way off topic and we need to get back to what this thread is about. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi Luvene , I do have the same situation with times on my broker IC markets , Don't know if this might help ,but I just trade what I see on the charts. ive, downloaded FXDD demo so I can see exact same as other guys but it doesn't differ that much. If you need to know exact time of candle closing times, you can download an indicator which will show you exact time to close of current candle to the second ,on your charts, there are quite a few just choose one you like . You most likely know all this already , if not, hope this helps, Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hi Orid and others, I have decided to go on with MT4 and with the Broker I have now, unless server time is -2 in relation to mine. The only thing I want to know now is following : when we are in a trade, and I will follow the rules exactly, than we have to move the stop-loss manually to our entry-point when we reached 50% of our possible Target/Profit. But, this means I have to watch the trade permanently and I will do this only once in every 4 hours. Maybe there is a script in MT4, or something else, the possibility of a so called adjustable order like most trading platforms have. When we reached a certain level the order changes in any kind of order you want. Example : we go long at EUR/USD on 1.3300 and our Profit is 1.3350. Then it would be great if the level of 1.3325 is reached the order will change our initial STP 1.3250 to 1.3300. Is this possible in MT4? Adjustables are great, of course you can change your order also to a Trail when a certain level is reached. Cheers! Luvene

Nice gap this morning on USDCHF in the right direction. Stop on USDCHF moved to breakeven.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Luvene: The Swiss Army EA will allow you to implement a breakeven stop when a certain number of pips have been achieved (parameter). Heck, it even has a feature to figure in commissions so it's a true breakeven stop. It does trailing stops also, though that's not part of this system, if I'm understanding it correctly. But you don't have to use that. Google Swiss Army EA V1.51. That will save you from having to sit in front of the computer or deal with alerts.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Thanks Garfield75 and tx_sandman for answering me. I will try to do so. Unfortunately I noticed that the alert indicator which Mike made there are some errors in it. Sometimes I see two green and 1 red and I get a signal for up..... Look at the graphic. I don't understand. On some Charts everything is alright but at this chart...... I checked everything several times. Cheers, Luvene

--- 帖子 #324 ---
luvene This is the problem with MT4, on different brokers you can get different results. The picture below is my EJ H4 chart and all the bars are correct. I have tested it on TradeFort as well and the bars match right. I agree the alerts are not always right which i am looking into. My indicator doesn't repaint the 3colormacd indicator does as the coder goes from newest bar back whereas i go form oldest bar to new. This might be the issue, not sure. As an aside, this is why i didn't post the EA. The thread is getting filled with comments about tools for the system rather than the system itself. This always happens, most of the time it is due to people not reading instructions or are too lazy to use google. Lets get back to posting charts of trades so we can all learn the system. The EA still isn't trading exactly as garfield75 but we are working on resolving this. Once it is trading right we will post it so others can test across different brokers and try different settings. I've exposed all macd numbers and MA settings and also BE and minimum candle size so lots of combos to try for different pairs as I'm sure thee will be some tweaking to be done. Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Mike, Thanks. You're right about that we should concentrate on the strategy itself but I don't like all the problems I have with MT4.....differences with timeservers and I was very happy in the first place with the MACD signal but unfortunately it doesn't work well.... No offense Mike, I appreciate your work!!! But when you have a lot of charts on your screen it is a must that you get an easy sound or another signal that you can open a trade. You must rely on this because when you have to look on all the charts it's a lot of work..... I hope I make myself clear. Thanks, Luvene

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Great stuff Mike, anyone else in this ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I do know what you mean and MT4 is crap really but it is the easiest way to trade for most retail traders. You stated earlier you are new to MT4, and that is why i wrote to he indicator to make life easier, i will look at the alert code again. As 1greyfox said its not too tricky to scan through the charts once every 4 hrs and check for a signal, the tricky bit is then entering the trades if more than one valid signal. This is where the EA will help as it calculates the stops and profit target and also monitors and moves to BE. I need to free up some demo space and set the EA running but H4 EJ should be in a short and the moment, like orid has just posted. Hope this helps Mike

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Good morning orid. Good luck with the trade. I didn't get in on that one but I am in the USD/CHF daily from last week, set at BE+3 I am triggered into the GBP/CHF 4 Hour long, aiming for the 1:1 according to the rules. 1greyfox

Hi Garfield75, I get a signal. I place my order(s). But I don't get triggered because the price do not reach that level..... When must I cancel the order? How many Bars or is there another rule? Sorry if you told something about it before. Thanks, Luvene

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hi luvene. Hope you had a good weekend. As I understand garfield75's rule on this is, if the trade doesn't get triggered *'during' the candle after the signal candle, the order gets closed. 1greyfox *The word 'during' has replaced the original word 'within' to add clarity.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Thanks my friend I go on with this strategy but first I have to understand everything. The problems with MT4 will not help unfortunately.... I need MT4 for the signals but that's all. I place my orders on another Trading Platform and directly I put a horizontal Line on 50% of the Target and I watch every four hour. I removed the MACD signal indicator, it confuses me more than it helped me with the signals..... Sorry Mike.... Maybe if you can make the indicator for generating only for a fresh/new signal that would be great.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
When you place the new pending order, you can right click on it to modify it &amp; place an expiration time for the start of the new bar. Then, if it doesn't execute it will cancel as it should. Pendings are only good for the following bar.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
well this ended going backward so I chickened out at +12 pips total 4 x 1hr trades + 36 pips one 4 hr trade on e/j loss - 37 pips regards Orid

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I take advantage of the MACD's different ways to position divergence as well, so for me personally I want to have many 3 MACD's around the chart.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
hi 1greyfox i think what you said is not true if you see this post : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...30#post6919830 garfield75 gets a sell signal while next candle doesnt break the low of signal candle and that sell position goes to tp so i think its better to check the past for that

--- 帖子 #339 ---
hi soltonhadi, That trade of Garfield was triggered on next candle after signal ,greyfox is saying if the trade had not triggered by the end of the candle, the order would have been closed. Regards orid

--- 帖子 #340 ---
On my 4H charts there is coming a possible entry at 14.00 PM my time. UK+1 time. -EUR/USD LONG -AUD/USD LONG -USD/CHF SHORT And Maybe GBP/CHF SHORT. Depends on the Slowest MACD, yet it is still green but maybe at 14.00 it will be red also. Cheers, Luvene

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hello soltanhadi Welcome to the thread. I think there is a mis-communication of words here, maybe I should have used the word "during" instead of "within' the candle after the signal candle. I edited my post changing the word 'within' to 'during', hopefully this will clear up any confusion. Sorry for the confusion, but what I posted is correct. Good luck with this method. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi luvene. Since you are using MT4 just for the setup and using your main broker for entries, wouldn't it be better to use an alert on your brokers platform when price has moved 50% in your favor. If you want to use MT4 for the alert you can setup a simple alert by clicking on the alert tab on the terminal window. Set the parameters and it will ding when price you set has been reached. It is difficult trying to learn a new trading platform in a short period of time, but you'll get there soon. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi luvene. I just looked at my charts and it appears that there are possible entry setups forming on all your pairs listed, I need to wait 2 more hours to know for sure if the are true. 1greyfox

hell lots of news coming next hour or so think I might pull out of my trades 3 out of 3 are in profit what do you other guys do? when you are in small profit and news looms? 50 pips is 50 pips ! Orid

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi orid. If the trade(s) haven't moved enough to lock in some profit and the news worries you(like it does me), I see nothing wrong in pocketing profits. After the news traders get done manipulating the market you can always look for another entry. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi lucariga. Each of us will use different 'filters' to hopefully stay out of some of the not so perfect setups that this and all methods generate. As I mentioned in previous posts, I look for previous support/resistance levels, if I can't easily fit in a 1:1 Risk/Reward I'll pass it by and wait for another setup. I also use garfield75's filter of trade setup being too close to the moving average to get a good R:R ratio. Also, if the price bar is straddling the ma I won't enter. As time goes on, you will also develop your own filters as to enter or not enter a trade. The EA will provide a trade signal but I don't believe it will be able to filter out trades based on garfield75's rules. Maybe the EA can filter out trades based on garfield75's rules, I don't know and will have to wait like everyone else until it gets released. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I've backtested some pairs on daily chart for 2011 2012 2013 and the results are not so bad, anyway I need to filter out some bad trades. For example I have had some trades triggered for 2 pips or less and went immediately to SL. Now I'm trying: - without the EMA filter (and the results seems better) - not to enter on the very high/low of the signal bar, but 3 pips above/below it (not sure about the results, because I filter some bad trades but I win 3 pips less for every good trade)

thanks for the good luck wishes I need Them , good luck to you also and everyone else here, Trades Today 4x 1hr trades 3 wins 1 loss = + 19 pips two I pulled out early for news to see them hit the TP also in GBP /jpy at moment looking bad its also the same one I lost on earlier -20 . also 2 x 4hr wins = 35pips , so =+ 54 total not bad considering just relying on signals , plus im a rank amature. off to bed .

hi 1greyfox you are right when i check the low of that green candle it is 152.798 vs. 152.814 which is low of that red candle so i conclude that just .00006 difference is enough for entering to a position sorry for that post in persian:چاکرتیم یک روباه خاکستری

Heya Greyfox, I haven't been here in a week (or so) and this looks new. I read through the first post on the first page looking for an update and didn't see an explanation. Care to help me out here? We just need the one indicator now?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Nevermind GreyFox, I found it here.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi lucariga. You are trying different filters on backtesting to see what works for you what doesn't, that is great! The idea of entering a few pips above or below the signal candle is good also, especially when going long because you get entered on the ask price instead of the bid price. When adding 3 pips you are basically adding the difference between the bid and ask(depends on currency pair). In other words, you are waiting for the bid price line to be equal to or above the signal candles high before getting triggered in the trade. On shorts, because you get entered in the trade based on the bid price, you might consider less than 3 pips, just do what is right for you. Missing 3 pips or so on a 4 hour chart is really nothing compared to what can be gained. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi orid. In your post I get a sense of traders remorse, "If I had only___________"(fill in the blank). OK, so the trades did reach the final profit target, that shows your analysis and profit target was correct. BUT, what if price went against you and hit the stop, then you would be beating yourself up for not taking your profit when you had the chance. These situations present a no win thought pattern which isn't good. You closed the trades in profit and beat the market. Congrats!!! The only expert with this method is garfield75, the rest of us are all rank amateurs, for now anyway. A month from now when each of us becomes comfortable and trusting of the setups presented on the chart, then we won't be amateurs any longer. I think you are doing well, relax and enjoy the ride. 1greyfox

Hi Baggi. The system is still the same using the MACD indicator set to 3 different settings, what has changed is there is a new indicator located at the bottom of post 1, it is called MTF MACD Signal v1.1.ex4. With this indicator you can replace the 3 MACD's on the chart as this will turn to red or blue depending on whether the signal is long or short. Some users have mentioned a problem with the signal itself so I set it to off. The way I set up my charts I can scan them in less than 2 minutes every 4 hours, daily, or 1 hour depending on which timeframe you trade so no sound alert needed. You can open your charts and tile them however you want, here is the post which shows my setup http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...63#post6963963 Garfield75 only trades 4 hour and daily so using shorter times is at you own risk. Well ,so is every other time frame. When I see a setup using the MTF MACD indi I open a new chart and apply the original setup template to the chart as I prefer to see exactly what the different MACD's look like. Each of you will have to decide what is best for your style. I know you said never-mind in your next post but I didn't see that until I wrote this reply. Happy trading! 1greyfox

Garfield, am I understanding correctly that you only trade this strategy 3 days a week. If this is true do you start your week at the Monday rollover and do you close out at the end of the day on Thursday?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
garfield75 sent me a email to update the EA with the following criteria: 1) EA shouldn't take any trade on monday till london opens. (ignore first 2 candles of the week). 2) EA shouldn't take any trade on Friday after london opens. (ignore last 4 candles of the week). So hopefully this clarifies the trading times, assuming H4 charts! Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I don't take trades till NY start on monday and don't open any new trades on Friday london session onward. If there are trades which are already open, I let them run there course over the weekend...

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I don't ignore Friday daily signals. Monday daily signals, I wait till london opens and then put pending stop only order, if price has already move beyond my entry then I ignore that trade.

I might be putting them in the wrong directory. I have under C rogram Files-&gt; MetaTrader -&gt; Experts -&gt; Indicators: 3colorMACD and 4 hours-multitfmacd. This is what they look like when I drag them over in MetaTrader: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hey Orid, How did you go with your trades on GBPCAD and GBPUSD ? My Daily GBPCAD trade is at BE, NZDUSD trade hit target. Have pending short on EURGBP and long GBPJPY on daily chart. Due to right ranging market, i didn't take any 4 hours chart trade yesterday..

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hello Garfield 75, Those two trades GB/CAD and GB US Both went to tp at + 67 and +57 pips however ,I have to be honest here and do need your advice here please. Although I do try to treat this demo as IF this was a LIVE ! account , with the major news on the horizon and I had to go to bed at the time ,,(both where only a few pips up at the time so no BE ) I Think under live trading cicumstances I would have pulled out because of that FOMC news coming up . I know this is a hard ask but what are your rules on this? I think I will just have to open a live account and trade micro what you reckon? which Greyfox has already recommended bless his cotton socks. Sorry to ramble on , thankyou for this system very very impressive! Regards Orid

a bit late just triggered Attached Image (click to enlarge) EDIT actually I think I should have that stop at top of wick ,

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Mindset is the biggest differentiator between winners and losers in the game of trading. I have the same issue as you with timing, since I live in Sydney. Since my system is based on multi timeframe and trend, most of the time news will move the market in the direction of the trend, worst case there is always stoploss to get you out of the trade without blowing your account. When a trade is triggered/active, I go to my MT4 platform on my VPS and put an alert on price at 50%. So when the price is at 50% it will trigger a notification, which is linked to my mobile MT4 on my phone, therefore when the phone rings in the middle of the night, I pick it up, open my MT4 and move my stoploss to breakeven and go back to sleep. Easy as that..

--- 帖子 #377 ---
What a great idea, Vps works without PC switched on I believe, looks like I will invest ,when I open live which will be very soon. Then the real battle starts with the old grey matter.LOL Thanks again Orid

Hi Garfield. how long do you leave a trade on? say on the 4 hr chart do you leave till it hits stop or tp or treat every trade as you see it. I missed one today through trigger happiness. regards Orid Ive sent you a PM

--- 帖子 #384 ---
how do you identify ranging market ? also you can use trailing stop for doing break even :just put trailing stop by value =tp/2 and when you wake up remove the trailing stop manually if activated

--- 帖子 #385 ---
hi You can use an EA to put yours trades at breakeven... Not the ones that i had posted... Sorry

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I leave trades on till SL/TP is hit.

nice work!!! Losers will come, but it's lot easier to deal with when you start with sting of winners !!!

will post it this weekend!!!

--- 帖子 #398 ---
looking at price action, macd &amp; candle size...

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I think we need to find a way to distil that into the EA. Here is a trade the EA took on GU. I think maybe a max candle size might help to stop reversals like this one. Maybe use and ATR/ADR ratio so changes per pair or we manually fix per pair from testing. I also was wondering your thoughts on the min candle size being the same for H1, H4 and Daily charts. Ive been running on all pairs on these 3 timeframes and i need to review the trades this weekend to see if i can find a pattern for winners and losers. Overall the EA is up 5% since 18th, was up to 7% so maybe some H1 losers reduced profits. I was messing with the EA code whilst running so missed a few of the winners this week. The EA will be released soon for demoing, for those who dont know how to use MT4 with EAs please start using google to find out how to stop the floods of questions. Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #400 ---
A small one on H1 taken long timt to get to = 16 pips still going Attached Image (click to enlarge) , also on this pair on daily thts up to 26 pips

--- 帖子 #401 ---
That trade i posted for GU H4 was invalid looking back at the picture in post#399. But i was looking at ADR, see pic and indicator attached, and i reckon a good filter apart from a minimum candle size of 25pips would be if the candle size is greater than the ADR there is a good chance price will reverse so skip trade. I'm still looking at the charts and checking losers but maybe someone else could take a look as well. In the picture the wrong trade, due to a restart, the bar was 164pips and the ADR was 66pips so skip trade. This system shows good potential. Regards Mike

Hi orid. Oh my!!! I leave for a few days to take care of other business and when I come back I see you are ripping the forex market to shreds with your wins! CONGRATS my friend, you are doing fantastic even without the EA. Have a great weekend everyone and I am looking forward to start trading again next week, I need some of those pips orid, so save me some. 1greyfox

I loaded up your breakeven file and it appears that this was/is a cracked product. There was a log file created with the following message. 2;228;;;using of decompiled source code is prohibited There are too many useful products created by folks who want to help everyone for free, and yet there are a few who must 'borrow' other peoples work without compensating them for it. What a shame. What if the product you uploaded had a bug implanted in it that when someone who was unauthorized to use it developed computer problems? Would you be willing to be held liable for such things? I doubt it. Maybe you knew about this, maybe you didn't, but I think it should be removed from your post or maybe garfield75 can get it removed if your post is older than 24 hours. 1greyfox

Hi furt. Thank you for removing the 'offending' EA, you could have left the the other Trade Manager EA(THV CaveManager) as it is freely available right here on ForexFactory. I am re-posting it here with the pdf for those who wish to try it out. Have a great weekend. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Mike. If I understand you correctly, we should add the Average daily range indicator to our charts and just do a visual backtest to check for entries that may have been skipped because of the close of a candle being too large. The ATR(120) period indicator has no bearing on checking, is that correct? Other than setting it to a period of 1 and then opening the data window(Ctrl+D) and using crosshairs to determine when the three MACDS and or the MTF MACD Signal indicator present an entry and then get the measure of candle size compared to the ADR. If candle is smaller then the ADR trade is valid as long as the candle was larger than 25 pips. I know some are asking why ATR of 1. When you place your mouse or crosshairs on a candle it will tell you the exact size of it in the data window, just look for the ATR(1) in data window, then compare it to the Average Daily Range to see which is bigger. I'll do visual testing this weekend starting with January 1, 2013 on the following pairs on the 4 Hour chart: AUD/USD EUR/JPY USD/JPY I will keep track of how many trades we shouldn't have taken based on candle size being larger than the ADR. I hope I got it right. I am attaching a pic to show what I am trying to explain. Hope you understand it, better yet, I hope I understand it. I apologize for the size of the pic, I should have made it smaller, but too late now. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi garfield75, magft(Mike), and everyone. Well, you can tell I don't have much of a social life, here I am on a Friday night doing backtesting instead of other things. Here are the results of the testing I did based on my prior post as I thought I understood what was trying to be accomplished. Of the 3 pairs I visually backtested looking for the ATR to be larger than the ADR, there were 23 candles generated on the 4 hour chart for the pairs since January 1, 2013 Either the next candle produced a no entry by the close of that candle, or if it did get an entry resulted in a BE or losing situation. Some trades would have been filtered out by the normal rules(price straddling ma, or too close to ma for trade entry, etc...). I don't recall seeing more than 1 maybe 2 trades becoming full 1:1 winners. I am attaching a pic of the dates and times of what I saw on my charts. Others may get different results based on when their 4 hour candle closes compared to mine which is based on the NY close as the end of the current day and beginning of the new day. Based on my visual test for these pairs I would have to say that adding the ATR/ADR filter would be a good thing. 1greyfox

Here is the EA. Demo only and use it on 4 hours chart, would not recommend to use it on any timeframe less than 4 hours. SERIOUS WARNING Most Forex traders lose all their money. Using the robot posted here in trading Forex does not guarantee success. Trading this robot could lead to serious financial loss. Trading this robot without understanding its underlying trading strategies guarantees traders will lose their money. This is not a set-and-forget ea; there is no such thing and anyone who tries to claim there is, is either stupid or lying. This ea requires frequent manual intervention.

Thanks greyfox to do the back testing on Friday night, hope you at least had a glass of wine next to you to keep you company!!!. Introduction of ATR/ADR is interesting, never looked at them before within this strategy, seems to improve the % return on equity based on your testing. @Mike - possible for you to update alert indicator and EA with ATR/ADR ? Cheers

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi All, I'm trying to understand if this system is profitable or not. On top of this thread there is the overview of the trades that was made using the system, I presume. All the last trades seems to be profitable but the performance of the week, month and year are all negative indicating a loss of 106 pips! What does that mean?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Thankyou for the Grats Greyfox im sure there are heaps of pips here for everyone. After me ! What you think of new colours Huh? must be pretty brightish and gory for most but good for me thx again Thankyou for your backtest on the ADR wish I could be more productive in this way. maybe in the future with experience. One thing you have me worried about is that you apologise in post 407 for the size of the picture you posted , seems I need to apologise also for my picture sizes, obviously I should have checked how to reduce the sizes ,but I honestly didn't realize I was flouting the rules I will have to check how to reduce the size before posting again, So my apologies everyone . have a good day. Orid

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi, Mike , Garfield , Greyfox , just like to thank you for all the great work you are putting into this system, very much appreciated looking forward to learning from you guys and everyone else here ! all the best! (Now to check on how to post those pics tut tut tut) regards Orid

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Are you trying to judge this by just looking at the account which is 1 week old or have you gone through all the posts on this thread ??

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Good morning orid. When I post a pic of a trade chart, I don't adjust the size because I think it is better full size. When I took the pic of the full MT4 platform to include the data window, the pic is the actual size of the monitor display itself and I felt it might be oversized for some. If it was a normal trade chart I wouldn't change it, but since I was drawing lines and doing explanations on the chart itself, I felt it may be difficult for some to follow what I saying because they had to scroll the pic up and down or from side to side to see where the arrows pointed to. I am out of breath with that explanation, more coffee please! I don't think you need to adjust your screenshot size because everyone has the option after the attachment is loaded up to click on it to have it fit their monitor size. You aren't flouting any rules for posting orid with the size of the pics you post. If people take the time to read the thread from the beginning they will understand why you have your colors setup that way. After speaking with you and to make this thread easier for you is why I made changes to the colors I use on my charts along with making changes to the indicator itself to allow the different colors and widths of the histogram on the 3 MACD's which are used. I have attached the modified indicator at the end of this post, I removed the hardcoding that prevented any color changes, also removed the restrictions on setting the width of the lines of the histogram. Also, you can change the color of the signal line and style of it, or set color to none to make the signal line not visible on the chart(which I don't recommend). I renamed it to 3colorMACD Modified.mq4 to avoid confusion with the previous version 3colorMACD BLUE.mq4 which had the colors hardcoded in it. Orid, you do not have to download this new named version as it is the same one I emailed you last week, just the name was changed to prevent confusion on the forum. 1greyfox

Good morning garfield75. I hope you are enjoying your weekend. Hmmmm.... wine and backtesting, perfect together! I can only imagine the results after a bottle(I mean glass) of wine. I was sober and hopefully alert when I did the testing. May have some today after I attend the funeral of a fellow firefighter(retired) in remembrance of him. Take care everyone. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi garfield75. I think we both already know the answer to your question even before apfreeza replies. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Thanks for clearing that up for me

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I have been following this thread since its inception with interest, great to see how its developed and i'm looking forward to having a play with the EA. Thanks to all who have contributed esp Mike, Garfield and Greyfox

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi Garfield, please believe me I was absolutely not critic about the system. I was only trying to understand what was that statistic on top of the page. If you say it is only a 1 week result, then I understand. I would like to try your system that it seems to me interesting. I have also an idea on how to improve it a little bit... We could use the Fibonacci tool. I mean the idea is when there is a triggered candle we can use a Fibonacci between the high of that candle and the low. Then we could have the stop loss at 0% and 2 take profit: the first at 161,8 and the second at 261,8... I hope I have been clear with my explanation.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi apfrezza. Very interesting, you are offering advice on how to improve a method you haven't even tried yet. Amazing. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi everyone. I wanted to get the results posted here of 6 more pairs that I visually backtested before I leave for the day. I should have added the last column to the very first group of pairs I tested, but I am not going back to redo them. Here are the total results for the pairs tested contained in the images. 68 Total Setups 9 - Straddles of the Daily ma location(1200ema on 4 hour chart) 13 - Breakeven 3 - Daily ema too close as target(1200ema on 4 hour chart) 24 - Not Triggered 9 - Losers 9 - Wins 1 - Still would be open 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Does anyone know which is the correct number for the 1 hour? Is it 104 or 312?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi Baggi The correct number is 104 You can find all the setting numbers on page 1 of the thread. garfield75 posted my chart with the correct settings for each time frame. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Thanks. so instead of taking the orignal rule of the system on 1:1 target. you recommend :- We can use Fib level to put 2 targets, first target less than 1:1 and second target more than 1:1, which kind of gives the same return on equity (improves by 0.20%). Not sure if it's worth the effort to add another indicator and then manageing multple trades and targets etc.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Thanks greyfox for backtesting... I am assuming that's using ATR. If you are upto some more back testing, then here are 4 pairs that I would like you to try. GBPAUD GBPCAD CHFJPY EURJPY Cheers

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi garfield75 No problem, I did the EUR/JPY in the first results post, but I'll redo it with the 'outcome of setup' added in. Yes, I am using the testing method described by Mike, so if the ATR candle is larger than the Average Daily Range I then measure to see if the trade would have worked or not. I should have it completed and posted before Sunday night market open. Sunday night came early, it is still Saturday but I completed the testing on the 4 pairs your requested. 24 Total Setups 2 - Straddles of the Daily ma location(1200ema on 4 hour chart) 3 - Breakeven 2 - Daily ema too close as target(1200ema on 4 hour chart) 15 - Not Triggered 1 - Loser 1 - Win 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I know 1greyfox, but in the new release program, or whatever it's called, that combines all three signals into one, the number changed. Wasn't sure why.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
By looking at all backtests you are posting, it seems the system is not profitable at all. With most of the cross pairs the results are close to breakeven... Am I not understanding the tests?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Thank you good work greyfox, seems maybe we could try to turn those 16 break even into partial wins move the be closer to tp so we get at least 25 % of profit , 16 break evens = 4 wins? ( please note this is probably a typical newbie suggestion now watch me get my ass kicked) Orid

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Not a good idea, in my opinion, anything less than 1:1 will put undue pressure on, when you face sting of losing trades...

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi everyone, I am still very interested in this strategy but my thoughts are the same. Maybe I don't understand but the originally system is Garfields with his parameters. So, please, I want to see the results only from Garfields on 4H without ATR or ADR or other indicators. No offense, I appreciate all the great adds in this topic, great work! Thanks, Luvene

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Good morning Baggi. When you use the MTF MACD Signal indicator, if you set the AutoParams to true it doesn't matter what numbers are showing in the boxes below, it will automatically adjust the settings internally for the time frame you switch the chart to. If you set the AutoParams to false, then you need to manually fill in all the boxes below that to match the time frame you are putting the indicator on. Also, by setting it to manual, this will allow you to try different MACD settings which you may prefer over the ones this method was designed around. Of course if your start changing things you will not be following the method as outlined by garfield75 and your results will definitely be different. Hopefully, I got you the answer I wasn't able to provide previously. If not, I'll try again, thanks for your patience Baggi. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hello apfrezza. You obviously haven't read the thread, because if you did you would know exactly what the backtesting was checking for. PLEASE read and understand the thread and test it before you offer suggestions on improving it, or making a conclusion about this method not being profitable. In your own words, you clearly stated that 'YOU HAVEN"T TRIED IT YET....' . So, instead of voicing erroneous opinions based on a fantasy created in your mind, try actually trading this method and learn it and make a conclusion as to whether this method fits with your style as a trader. If it does, that is great. If it doesn't well at least you learned that this method isn't what you are wanting to use in your trading arsenal to earn money. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi orid. I promise not to kick you too hard. Each time we had a breakeven trade was because of price retracing back down to the entry level after the stop was moved to breakeven. When a single candle is larger than what the average daily movement is, it is telling you that the market has over-extended itself and needs to catch its breath(retrace). The filter that is being tested is to help remove the signal that is generated by one candles over-sized reaction to whatever caused it, hopefully preventing a setup that most likely won't work out profitably. When you get a signal now, you take the trade and you get out at breakeven you are happy that you didn't lose on the trade. Right? Well, this filter will prevent you from entering a trade because of the candle size being bigger than the ADR most likely won't work to a 1:1 Risk/Reward. Also, why tie up your capital on trades that have a VERY VERY low of chance to win? On the last two sets of results I posted, there were 92 trade setups, the wins and loses were equal, so you gained nothing from entering them. This filter would save you from entering 92 money tying up trades that could be used in better trading situations. The name of the game is capital preservation. This has to be the most important thing you can do as a trader. Hopefully, I just nudged you and not kicked too hard. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Good morning luvene. Please don't get sucked into what apfrezza posted, his thoughts and conclusions about this method aren't based on any fact, just his imagination. If you read my post just above this one you may get a better understanding of why I am testing the ATR ADR. The results of this filter were to keep you out of 92 trades that had no gain in capital this year. That is 10 trades a month that you avoided exposing your money to for a low win probability trade. As far I know, nothing else has changed and all the original rules are still the same as before. This filter is being tested only on the 4 hour charts as this was/is the original intent of the thread. So, it shouldn't affect you if you trade the smaller time frames. If my conclusion is incorrect, I am sure garfield75 will correct me. Happy trading this week. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #437 ---
no worries greyfox its just that some of those candles are quite large . but yes greed must not spoil the system good stuff orid with sore ass

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi orid. At least you are still speaking to me. One other thing worth considering since you mentioned that some of the candles being quite large. Would you feel comfortable having to place a stop 200-300 pips away on a 4 hour chart? I know I wouldn't. Even if you risk only 1% percent of your account per trade you would need at least a $2000 account just to set stop at 200 pips away from entry in order to open the trade with 1 microlot. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #439 ---
no way ! I get the ebe jeebies on a 30 pip stop and that's on a demo ha ha , Lesson learnt I will be quite

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi orid. ebe jeebies! LOL! I haven't that phrase in years. I guess we are showing our age here. Please don't be quiet. Afterall, the way we learn is by reading and asking questions. When I first started trading I had millions of questions(I still do), so we hope that one with more experience will share what they have learned with those who are new on this journey. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi 1greyfox, I'm really sorry if it seemed I was criticising this strategy. However I only asked a question: is the original system (4 hrs tf) profitable or not??? it seemed you are trying to modify the original system with daily timeframe but in this case it is evident that there is no profit because macds are too slow and when all 3 are lined up the trend goes to an end!!!

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Here is the EA updated to check if the candle size is greater than the ADR skip the trade. You can turn the filter on/off using UseADR=true/false. The ADR is based on the following calculation taken from the indicator code: I'll update the indicator soon to help visually basktesting but the EA can be used visually. I have been running the EA on H1,H4 and D1 charts and its doing doing ok but still gives the profits back. I think if we can filter this down to improve winners and skip losers (any ideas?) we will have a good system. The message about decompiled code is new one with current versions of MT4, you would be surprised them amount of code that is based on old decompiled code, so dont always shoot the messenger Another good EA for trade management is MPTM by Steve Hopwood, has lots of settings so can be configured to do most styles. Pop on over to www.stevehopwoodforex.com . Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Could someone please change the EA so that it has the settings for the daily charts.

Pls read post #433 by greyfox

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thanks greyfox for back testing these pairs. couple of question 1) Which broker did you use to test ? 2) Did the timeframe include upto 20th Sept 2013 ? Cheers Garfield

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi apfrezza. I only started this method 2 weeks ago so it is too soon for me to conclude if it will continue to be profitable to me or not. I use this method along with another trading method(which I won't discuss here), so far it has been profitable for me. I am not trying to modify the system to a daily time frame, one user was trying it on daily and for him it didn't seem to work that well, he asked for someone(which I volunteered) to do comparative backtesting of his platform with MT4 to see if the signals were the same for each of us. This thread was started with the focus on the 4 hour time frame, garfield75 made up additional templates for those who wanted to try it on other time frames. 1greyfox

Hi garfield75. It was my pleasure to help. Doing it actually helped me see visually all the setups that appeared since the beginning of the year. I think if more users did what I did they would have a better understanding of the method you presented to us. To answer your questions; I used FXDD for the visual backtesting on all pairs except the GBP/AUD and GBP/CAD, for these two pairs I used Alpari-US. Those two pairs were recently added to FXDD and didn't contain data from January 1, 2013 Yes, it did include the data through Friday NY close on September 20, 2013 Take care. 1greyfox

Hi Mike. I like the idea of choosing whether to use the ADR to filter trades or not. Now everyone can decide for themselves which they like better. Are you using the 25 pip minimum size candle on all the time frames, or have you made the minimum smaller for the 1 hour chart for testing purposes? Thank you for explaining the decompiled code issue, I will be gentler in the future. Thanks for your work on this project, it is greatly appreciated. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Cool, I can't comment on FXDD, I personally use Axitrader, IBFX and currently in demo with Alpari UK. Please take look at this chart which is with my Alpari account, where I have 2 GBPAUD trades executed, one to BE and one to profit, can you please both in Sept, but I can't see these trades in your list.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I like to add the option to turn on/off filters when testing as it gives more flexibility and code wise it is very simple to implement. I don't really have the time to test thoroughly so it is good that others can help do this, that is why i like to help out with the coding. I was going to ask the question what should the min candle size be for each timeframe, currently i have it set the same for all. Also the MA should be at 4800 not 1200 but i read somewhere is doesn't work correctly so i left it at 1200 in the AutoParams. For testing the EA works on M15 to D1 if AutoParams set to True based on the values in post#1. Regards Mike

orid nice trades, what value for MA are you using? Here is an indicator that plots blue when the candle size is greater than the MinCandleSize(25pips) but less than the ADR and red if outside this range. Should help visualise when backtesting, if you look at the data window it gives the candle size and ADR as well for reference. Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #458 ---
You are a legend Mike, Thanks. That MA is ema 200 on the 1 hour Orid

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Good morning garfield75. The reason those two trades didn't get marked on my backtesting was because the candle size on each of them was less than the Average Daily Range. My backtesting was based on marking candles that were larger than the ADR. 09-06-2013 08:00 candle size=67 pips ADR=173 pips 09-17-2013 08:00 candle size=50 pips ADR=152 pips I agree with your 1 win and 1 breakeven. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Good morning orid. Once again, ,nice trading. Since you are becoming the master on the 1 hour chart, would you let us know if your decision to take these trades is because the setup signal candle is 25 pips or more in size? Have you taken any trades on the 1 hour where it was less than 25 pips? If so, what were your results? Thanks for posting your charts, nice to see those colors! 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi Mike. If I recall correctly, garfield75 mentioned that he didn't bother adding the ema to any chart smaller than the 4 hour because MT4 can't compute the larger numbers needed to plot the daily ema on the smaller time frames. Once again, thank you for all the work you are putting into the EA. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi All, Read the whole thread last week and first off - I want to thank Garfield75 for posting his system. I have done 7 trades and had 4 winners and 2 losers, so far. really like the simplicity of the system. thanks to all for there time and effort on the EA. I have a couple of questions? I loaded the 4H template from page -1 and I noticed that on the 3rd MACD settings - they are different from the chart on page-1. For the 4H TF the 3rd MACD settings on the chart are- 360, 780, 270. but when loading the 4H template the settings for the 3rd MACD are- 360, 780, 486. which should I be using?? Allso noticed that the bar count for the MACDs is set to 3000 when loading the 4H template but Garfield quoted someone later in the thread that this setting is 1000. which is correct? Just to ask when loading the 4H template the MA is 1200 is this correct? thanks all for your time and I will be testing this and will give you my rezults thanks

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I think most of the !hour trades have been between 22 and 32 pips and a couple 17 -20 maybe I should keep a journal What I will do is keep a copy of the live trades for 24 hours , so if anyone asks to see any of my trades I can post for any (welcome criticism) Live trading by end of week hopefully. glad you like the colours . regards Orid Ps sent a PM

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Sorry greyfox the results , It is 1 hour is 11 wins 4loss but havn't kept strictly to the rules , pulled out some of those wins and losses ( because almost at tp) and news coming up or bed time . l will try to keep a better record from now , and try to be disciplined at leaving the trades on . off to bed now . may your pips be many Orid

--- 帖子 #465 ---
where did the trades go? i can't see them any more. please post them again, don't get discouraged for only a week's results, Thanks!

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Forgot to mention The 4 hour are good too 5 wins @ about +45 average 1 loss . daily 1 trade a win @ + 72 Now going to bed night all Orid

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hello iamsovereign. Congrats on the wins! Very nice way to start a new method. The pic on the first page showing the MACD settings for several time frames are the correct settings for each of the MACD's. 270 is the correct number for the third setting on the third MACD on the 4 hour chart. 3000 or 1000 is up to you, that number is for how far back you want to see the MACD on the chart, you may want to set it to 1000 because it will use less computer resources when having lots of charts loaded up. You are correct, 1200ema is the correct setting on the 4 hour chart. It will be nice to see some of your trade charts and results posted. I wish you continued success. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi orid. Thanks for the information about the candle size range. If you do decide to keep a journal for your 1 hour chart trades, would you include the size of the setup candle, and the outcome of the trade. You can be the guinea pig for what works on that time frame. Congrats on making the decision to open a live account, I am sure you'll have the support of everyone here. I'll check the PM and may reply to it by e-mail depending on what is in it. Get some sleep, you earned it. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hi sailorvt. I think he took it down because the EA has been updated. My guess is he'll open a new account using the updated EA for us to follow the results with. I could be wrong, and often am but that seems logical to me. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I have removed that account as we have changed the EA. Once some trades are active, I will link back 2 accounts to the thread again to track the performance with and without ATR/ADR condition filter.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Slight mod to the CheckADR indicator, i noticed that it wasn't refreshing properly so changed some of the logic and now seems to update each bar correctly now.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I've been doing some more testing with the EA ans i noticed that it was misreading the indicators. I've been through the code and found a typo which has now been fixed, not sure how i missed it but i'm happy now it works as required (like the earlier version before the ADR addition). Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Should the ADR calculation include the sunday candles on H4 and H1 charts? I think the current calculation includes the sunday candles and this may skew the values slightly. Let me know your thoughts. Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #474 ---
HELP ive been hovering over three trades @ + 70 pips for 3 hours should I pull the pin?

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Good morning Mike. FXDD uses the NY close as the end of day, they don't produce the small Sunday candles on the 4 hour chart that other brokers do because of the time they choose to end/start a new day. This is a topic I can't provide any help with, sorry. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Good morning orid. I think I'll let you trade my account. To pull the pin or not pull the pin, that is the question? What are your rules for exiting a trade? Would you feel cheated if you closed them now and later see them reach the final target? Are you happy with a 70 pip gain? What is causing your 'fear' at this time? On those trades, do they look as though price has just stalled or are you seeing signs of price reversing? Many questions and no answers. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Good morning Mike. Thanks for the update as I loaded up the previous updated version on a few charts this morning and noticed problems with the EA. No sense posting those pics now since you caught the 'bug' that may have been causing the problems I noticed. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #478 ---
stalled back to 30 pips Post charts shortly impressive I think .

If it was live I would have pulled ouy at 70 pips or even less plus already have two wins from this morning. Now im getting a swollen head mama mia

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hello orid. If it was live you'd have closed them at 70+, may I suggest then you do that on demo also. I say this because we should strive to trade demo as close to a real account as possible. I also see on your charts that you have the 200ema of the current time frame showing. Do you use this ma to help you determine if you have a trade setup or not? I know that having an ma on the smaller time frames isn't part of garfield75's rules so I am assuming(bad choice of words) that this is one of your modifications to the method. If you use the 200ema to determine whether a trade is valid then use the same rule of not taking a trade if you can't get at least a 1:1 Risk/Reward when trading towards it. This could have kept you out of a couple of trades including the gbp/jpy which is currently in profit. So, nothing is perfect in trading. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I will remove the 200 ma I haven't been using it for the system, just noting how many trades went bad trading against it, seems to make no diff , but then neither does anything else? closed the one trade for 35 sure enough it rocketed almost immediately to tp at 56 . t hems the breaks

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Just follow the rules. once the trade stop is moved to breakeven, it's a risk free trade, outcome either way, to TP or BE is not going to have any negative impact to your account!!

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Ok Garfield , thankyou I will do that from now, " but its so hard seeing those pips handed back "! slap slap stop that Orid be strong you pillock I will. I will. Orid

Hi orid Once again, CONGRATS, you are doing awesome my friend. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #487 ---
thanks for posting the EA magft have loaded it on h4 20 pairs. will report back with results. i noticed on the bottom of the on screen display that the EA is demo only and will expire at the end of october. can i ask is there any plans to remove the demo limitation, e.g. if testing goes well? or is it that there are plans for a commercial version? cheers, blam

--- 帖子 #488 ---
A full version will be released once we are happy it works correctly, the limitation is more to make sure people dont lose money trading it live before we have ironed out all the bugs. It doesn't matter how many disclaimers you write people still ignore them so this just makes sure. Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #489 ---
thanks for the explanation mike the original system is a good one, so looking forward to getting some trades with this EA this week. will report back after testing, have ADR = true on my demo blam

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Ok, i've been playing around with code and added the daily range to the indicator. So now if you check the data window it shows CandleSize, ADR, RoomUp, RoomDown, Trade and No Trade. Also if the blue bar is only half it means the CandleSize is greater then either RoomUp or RoomDn. I then decided it would make more sense to visually see the room up/down so i wrote ADR Range indicator. Have a play visually and see if you can spot anything useful. Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Hi Mike. I'm not sure if I can wrap my head around this as I am seeing too much information on the chart. I get the idea of where you are headed, but I am wondering if the extra lines and indicator might start complicating things a little too much. We might be adding too many things and this may cause confusion as to take a trade or not. I made an adjustment to the Average Daily Range indicator to allow it not to show color if you choose, this will hide the line but make the information still available in the data window. It is attached below. I am also including a pic of how my chart looks with both the ADR and ATR. By putting the mouse over any candle it is easy to look at the data window and get the information needed. In my old age, I like less on the chart, it is less strain on the brain and eyes. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #492 ---
u r on fire . Thanks for helping to prove that, the system is easy to follow and profitable...

--- 帖子 #493 ---
hey mike and garfield not trying to jump in and make too many demands without contributing anything, just thought that given Orid's success trading this on the 1H timeframe, would it be possible to have an option in the EA to allow timeframe to be selectable? as a lot of us work full time and can no way trade 1H charts so would be handy for the EA to take those trades? blam

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I think the EA works on 1 hour chart if you want to run it to see how it performace. We are only testing it on 4 hours.

hey Orid, which part of Aus are u from ? Cheers

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Albany wa , Would you know how to set this break even EA , when I set pip it goes straight to current price . thanks in advance We have a spare room if you are ever over this way.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I am assuimg thats becuase it's not able to switch between 4 and 5 digit broker automatically. so if you want to set the value to 15 pips, then change it to 150 for 20 pips it should be 200. basically multiply the pip with 10 and that is the value to be set in the EA. Try that, it should work, if my assumption is correct.

I know this is a what if ,but I have to tell it , two of the trades I posted yesterday NZ JPY NZ US I pulled out (manually)because of stalling they were two of my BE trades.

I know what you mean about chart clutter, what i am trying to do is find filters for the EA that in manual trading dont apply as visually and "gut feel" stop bad trades. If the pair has already covered its daily range its less likely (this is forex so who knows!) to move up above the range by much thus meaning a lower probability trade. Orid is doing great on H1, the EA is using 1200EA currently but orid said he uses 200 but ignores it. I can add option to turn MA check on/off if it is required. But news and trades stalling stop trades, an EA doesn't know this so we need to think of suitable filters to mimic this. All im trying to do is stir up ideas really, though manual trading is looking good so far. Attached is a script i've been using to enter the trades for the system, you enter "BUY or "SELL" and change other settings as required. It takes the previous candle high and low and sets the sl and tp accordingly. Should help with manual trading. Regards Mike

I think this is a very good system, if added to a system that uses confirmation signals from IKH, bollinger and Aroon's oscillator, it can be soooo powerful. Although it does mean trades are much less frequent.

Nice work!!! Traders who are trading this on lower timeframe than 4 hours. It might be a good idea to trade the active market onl, (London and US session), also limit pairs to 3-4 max.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Good morning orid and everyone. Hope everyone is doing well. I don't think you did anything wrong orid. I might have skipped the trades because we are in a range pattern with lots of congestion to the left. Also, according to one of my rules(not the method rules) if there wasn't least at 1:1 clearance from the entry point to the prior high or low, depending on direction of trade of course, I would have not entered. I attached pic which hopefully will provide better clarification. 1greyfox

Hi orid. I am finally caught up on going through the thread and even though you had a few losing trades, overall I think you ended the week on a positive note which is great. Have a great weekend, you deserve it. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hi everyone. I know I was missing in action for a few days and it feels good to be back. I want to welcome all the new folks to the thread and wish them great success with garfield75's method. Patience is the key to making this method successful, you won't catch every trade, none of us get them all. Most importantly, practice on a demo account until you fully understand how the method performs on the currency pairs you like to trade. Have a great weekend. 1greyfox

Thanks 1 Greyfox Where have you been ? Thought the grizzlys had got yer my live account should be on for Monday Orid

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Hello orid I was un-netted. We lost internet/phone service at the house, so when it finally came back I was so far behind on other duties that it took a while to get back here. When you live on the edge of a forest in a town with about 500 people, you really aren't that important to the communications companies. I recently saw them burrowing fiber optic cable but that is 10 miles away from where I am located. Hopefully they have plans to connect the local telephone substation up with this cable so my internet speeds will reach 21st century minimums. It is even worse when we lose electricity, we can be on generator for a week or more. Life is great when you live in paradise, or where I live now(paradise is on the horizon)! Congrats on going live, you know how to reach me if you need to. 1greyfox

Good morning orid. Thank you sir. I am happy with the pip count considering these trades were active on Friday. If I didn't manually close the CAD/JPY and USD/JPY the results of those two trades would currently be CAD/JPY still open and the USD/JPY reached the final profit target. For my peace of mind, I prefer to close out everything on Friday. With the current situations around the world and the market makers gaps on Sundays market re-open we have absolutely no control over those 48 hours, I prefer to have the money sitting inactive in the account for the weekend. Come Monday, we get a fresh look at things and can then re-enter if conditions are met. Capital preservation is the only way we can live to trade another day. Enjoy the rest of the weekend my friend. 1greyfox

Greyfox, I noticed you missed on one trade by a fraction, because the price did move to your area, but not the bid. Have you considered paying the fee instead of taking the spread? I've found that my buy and sell go off a lot more, because the spread is about half a pip or less. Which makes me very happy. I hate missing a buy or a sell because it doesn't move a hair further.

Hi Orid Commiserations on the Dockers

--- 帖子 #567 ---
just thought i let you folks know even on the 4hr the macd indi repaints..

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi everyone Great thread - MTFA is NUMBER1 May I suggest - that as we are trading an indication of a change in price direction, and intend taking only high probability trades - it may be of benefit to add a simple filter when we have a ranging market When we have a ranging market our chances of having false signals are greatly increased A simple filter could be to only take a trade if our MACD signal is confirmed by trading in the immediate trend direction eg for a long trade we now have higher highs and higher lows (change to line chart for easy recognition), opposite for a short trade The MACD is great for identifying when a pair is trending - why not just stick with the trade until the MACD suggests the trade is over (slope reverses)? If you use the 12.26.1 for your entry but feel a bit unsure of using it for an exit, maybe you could use the 5.13.1 for your trade management exit If your normal trading timeframe is range trading - try switching to a lower timeframe for tradable signals (the lower timeframes build the next higher timeframe chart) PS My preferred trading system is very similar to the one described here

Hi MeLe , Thankyou I 'm not a very good supporter,(Fremantle Dockers) I don't attend matches but would have liked to see them win that final . Good match! I think they might have if they had got off to a good start. Where in aus are ya? Regards Orid

Orid Hi Yes the first quarter let them down with their kicks for goal, I am a Eagles supporter. I live at Collie, half way from Perth to you at Albany. Or maybe you are already in the Penthouse in Perth. Regards Barry

Hi Baggi. I have not thought about it because in my way of trading once I get a trade to a breakeven + a few pips I just let it run to profit target or stop loss. When I lock in a profit, I just move on to look for more opportunities. The idea of having a smaller spread is appealing and if I was more of a scalper it would hold more interest than it does for me now since I trade longer time frame charts. I appreciate your suggestion and will keep it in mind if I notice the same scenario playing out to often as it did on the CAD/CHF trade from Friday September 27, 2013. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi whatfx. Personally, I have never seen an indicator that doesn't repaint on the current candle as they are recalculating the current price action. Does it repaint after the candle has closed, or just on the current candle? Anyone can paint with a broad brush so please narrow down your statement to make it more applicable to what you are trying to convey to the originator and users of this thread. Also, which indicator are you referring to? Is it the regular MACD's or the indicator which has the 3 MACD's combined into one indicator? I see why you status yourself as 'the villain'. You show up, make a broad statement which could cause doubt to the validity of this method to people who are currently using it, without providing charts or anything to support your statement. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Hi lizpet. May I ask how long you traded this method before you concluded that your filters are more profitable than the way it is intended to be traded by the thread originator? Why does it have to be complicated? If in a range draw a simple set of horizontal lines and don't take trades until out of that range situation, or take a trade with caution if there is room for a 1:1 Risk/Reward before reaching the top or bottom of the range. Just because your preferred trading system is similar does not in fact make it exact to garfield75's method, so it is possible that your suggested 'filters' could cause problems for the users of this method instead of improving it. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi Garfield75, Thanx for sharing this system. As a newbie, I'm more comfortable using the MACD than any other indicator. This systems enhances an already good lagging indicator. I successfully added the indicator to my platform but I had trouble with the templates. What software is needed to successfully download the templates to MT4? Regards, FXAnnie

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hi FX Annie, Im not the best to answer this new trader also , but ill try. download templates from page 1 no other software needed, also download the macdi color indicator , or just download the macd color indicator and set your own charts, then make sure all the settings are same as the tables also on page 1. Hope that helps , and if ive not explained very well ,hopefully someone else will chime in and put us both right Good luck BTW the templates you put in templates , not indicators incase you didn't know

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hi greyfox Fair enough It was just a suggestion. Take it or leave it Nobody should ever trade without testing to see if it works for them AND it should make sense to them before they even start testing! Sorry for intruding Peter

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi lizpet. It isn't a matter of intruding. You made a post making suggestions on a method you apparently never tried as it is outlined by the originator of the thread. So, if you are offended because I asked a couple of pertinent questions, so be it. To make suggestions when you haven't used the method, is like a newbie baker modifying the chemistry of a recipe before they even know how or why the original recipe is designed the way it is. In trading and in baking, blind ignorance of the basic method is not bliss. 1greyfox

Morning /evening all, Getting lonely here , my two dailys ended , one at BE , the other I closed at + 78. In this 4 hr at mo and a daily at + 23 Regards Orid Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hello my friend. Nothing wrong with the way those trades ended. BE is better than a loss. +78 is great! When you move your stop to breakeven, do you set it to BE+0 or do you add something like BE+5, so it earns something? I am currently in that EUR/CAD myself. I see you already moved the stop up to BE, mine is still in its original place. It will be interesting to see how it plays out because of our different trade management styles. You are by the book and I....well, not so much. Congrats, keep it up. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hi Greyfox , actually , I t was Be + 15 ,didn't say because not the rules and my mate Garfield might shout at me LOL. But seriously I moved to be + 15 because it had reached + 65 and I thought a 50 pip breather was plenty, and if it did come right back , well 15 pips !!is something Well my funds of $100,000 dollars have been accepted so now it will take me a while to set everything up properly. so I don't make any mistakes with LIVE TRADING . (may not take so many trades now till confidence boosts) Regards Peter

Hi Garfield, nice trade, and love those chart colors ,things people do for me i'm truly thankful , no joke its almost impossible for me to read the green and red ones, I have to call my wife. Just had my first live trade a winner + 18 pips (H1) 10 cents a pip my account has jumped from $1000 to $1001.56. heh its a start pips are the main thing for me at the mo. One thing baffles me live account showing slightly different macd colors to the demo both same broker and same feed so they say.? Regards Orid

Hi orid. Congrats on getting the live account up and running. I know you'll be successful. Be patient and do what you are doing currently and all should be fine. Hmmm.... $100,000 I am sure if you take it steady your real $1000 will become a $100,000 Then I'll be hitting you up for a loan. I don't think Garfield will object to you going to a positive number when setting the BE. Afterall, profit is profit! 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Good morning Garfield. Congrats on the winner. With the way you and orid are making a killing on the 1:1 settings, I might have to rethink my trade management style for your method and still use my larger profit targets for my other trading method. 1greyfox

Hi orid. WOO HOO! ! It's party time down under. Congrats on breaking in the live account in the right direction. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Now Now Greyfox settle down , I can only loan you 30% of that $1.56 Thanks mate , how do you trade when there is news a coming, stay out ? Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I'll take 30% LOL!!! If the news is high impact(red) I stay out because of the market makers manipulation during that time. I can't think of a better way for the 'bigboys' to earn millions(billions) off of retail traders than during news events. Now that the U.S. government is shut down I would hesitate on taking any live trades. Also, since it is now a tentative NFP week adds more uncertainty so I won't be trading live for the rest of this week and probably the first 2 days of next week. As you tell I am cautious, maybe too cautious, but in 5 years of trading I have never blown up an account(real or demo), so I doubt I will change that feature about me. Each of us has to choose what feels right for them. I might suggest that if you want to trade the news time do it on demo until your are confident with the results before attempting it live. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Thanks for the reply I do hate trading when news around , never know what is going to happen , mind you its like that anyway , you wanna cheque or cash? Orid

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Hi orid. Forgive me for offering my analysis on your AUD/USD trade, especially since it differs from the garfield75 reasons for taking it. The chart and analysis is based on my own thoughts but may provide useful information to you for future trades when you see something similar. On my chart that I posted the little red candle(current), just closed(9AM NY time) in real time and it looks like it came very close to your stop, I hope it didn't hit it and price moves back up now. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Your welcome my friend. Since you hate it, you may want to develop a trading rule to not enter trades that are either directly associated to the news event or just not trade for a few hours before or after high impact news. Since you like the 1 hour charts, you may consider the same rule for medium impact news also. 1greyfox

Hi orid. Thanks for the updated chart. Sorry for the loss. Some days are better than others and today just isn't one of them. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Yes thanks for that greyfox , I shouldn't have taken that trade I didn't check the adr , mind you it should have been obvious that was a large candle, same with the trade I lost on it didn't exeed the adr but was a big candle , might srteer clear of candles over 40-45 pips in future, and I must keep an eye on that adr thanks again, all the best Orid

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Hi orid. From what I am seeing so far, the ADR has the most impact when trading on the 4H chart. Smaller time frames don't seem to be affected by it as much. So when trading the 4H it might be good to check if the signal candle or the one prior to the signal candle have already moved further than the ADR. Maybe those 40-50 pips candles on a 1H chart are to big to consider trading. Next time one shows up, just visually watch how it would have played out if you did take the trade. We are all still learning this method in one way or another. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hey guys, what you think about the account linked to this thread? -10% witout ATR and -8% wit ATR at the moment.....

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hi lucariga Been a while since you visited, hope all is well. Are you still backtesting it? I haven't seen any charts posted by you lately. Personally, it is disappointing to see that the EA's are in negative territory as I hoped it would be of benefit to folks who didn't have much time available to them for chart watching. Maybe some trade management variables could be added to the EA which may improve it, but since I don't do programming I can't try them out. For me, it really doesn't matter because I wait til a signal appears on the 4 hour chart with the 3MACD indicator, then I load up the regular chart showing the three MACD's and then decide if I want to risk it or not. And then there is orid who has been doing well on the 1 hour charts by waiting for a signal to appear and then deciding whether to jump or not. Only time will tell on the evolution of the EA, but for those who trade manually, this method can work if you have the patience to wait for the right conditions. Good luck to you. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Yeah. I've seen Orid results and I think we should implement you "discretion" into the EA. I've backtested the EA without ATR on a daily basis for all the pairs (2010 2011 2012 2013) and the results are not bad, but I think we need to add some "filters". Unfortunately I can't program because the EA posted hasn't the source file attached... Maybe you and Orid, that are ther most profitable around here, could explain your "discretion on entries" in details so someone can implement it into the EA.... Regards

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi all you good people, WELL, I have had a very very bad day ,no make that a couple of days , Live trading even at 10 cebts a pip has destroyed my confidence, nothing wrong with the system. If I had traded as per normal as I have been ,today I would have done ok, probly 50-60 pips, BUT I got nowhere because of uncertainty etc., So from now I promise myself, Garfield and all you nice people whom Ive been impressing with my trades ,that I will trade this live account exact same as the demo . You all deserve more from me ,after the way ive been trading, Todays trades , 4 trades -2.5 pips crap. Cant believe some of the things I did ! Tomorrow I will be going fishing weather permitting. Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hello my friend. I am sorry to hear that things didn't work out well today or this week. When it is NFP week, I become very cautious about trading. If this had been a normal week(no U.S. government shutdown) I would stop trading for the week by 12:00pm NY time today(October 2, 2013) and NOT start again til the Tuesday after NFP. Since the U.S. is shutdown I didn't take any live trades this week. I do have some demo trades running because I wanted to see how the EA performs by itself, but nothing live. From what see we should have all taken this entire week off to go fishing. I would like to suggest to you that after your relaxing day fishing and you come back to chart watching(trading) to do it on the demo account until the current turmoil subsides and the market starts moving in better fashion. The folks on this forum 'deserve' nothing from you. What is important is what you deserve for yourself and family. You, me, and others have taken on this trading career to improve our lives and those we care about. If the readers of this forum can gain something useful from what is posted here, that is wonderful. Do what is right for you and not worry about how others may perceive you in this thread. Trade on demo til you regain the confidence you had before going live, and soon you will be ripping the market to shreds again. If you can, go fishing for the next 4 days and not look at charts again until Monday or Tuesday. 1greyfox P.S. A friend sent me the attached picture a few years ago when he learned that I enjoyed fishing and wanted a boat. What a character he is.

Good morning lucariga. I am attaching 2 charts of the GBP/CHF trade setup which showed up yesterday on the linked explorer at the beginning of this thread. To me discretion and filters are based more on the human factor of analysis when looking at a chart. When the EA or the MTF_MACD_Signal indicator lets me know that a trade setup has occurred, I don't just jump in the trade. The first chart shows the valid entry based solely on the signal generated. The second chart shows what I do to either validate the trade or discard it. As I mentioned in previous posts, I do feel the EA has a purpose to alert to a 'possible' trade setup and maybe manage the trade if we enter it, but I still feel there is a need to manually analyze the chart before we risk money. I apologize for the amount of times I mention some sort of a disclaimer to my posts and charts, I do this to clarify my position on how I look at charts before placing a trade. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hi everyone. Here is a demo trade I took on the EUR/CAD 4 hour chart. Some of you probably got out a day or so ago, but because I am stubborn and use different trade management rules instead of those outlined in this thread trades may take longer to finish. Thankfully, this one did finish as a profitable trade(+73.5 pips) in demo dollars. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hi everyone. Here is another trade on the EUR/GBP 4 hour chart. Based on the trading rules for this method you would have netted a BE+5 pips. Since I use other trading rules, I had a loss of 33.2 pips. The dotted line on the chart is a 200ema which I am experimenting with but is not part of the method. Life is a journey and this is just another step on the road. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Good charts and details greyfox , I think maybe you should stick to the 1 : 1 profit take. Ive spent a few hours backtesting and the results are very impressive They are not absolutely accurate by any means . Don,t know whether I should put them up here I just did a visual backtest on a few pairs , for sept and july 1hr and 4 hr as I said they wouldn't be spot on but gives me great confidence in this system. For any one that's got a few hours to spend going goggle eyed I think you would be surprised. Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi orid. Sorry to hear about the turmoil you are currently experiencing. In previous posts I mentioned reasons(suggestions) why this week wasn't a good week for trading, one can only offer suggestions, it is up to the person reading it to accept it or reject it. On the GBP/USD trade what were the reasons fr closing it early? Was it because it was retracing back up and you saw the profits shrinking(fear), or was it because of some analysis that caused you to lose confidence in the trade? I ask this because when I first read your post I got the feeling that you are losing the optimism you had before you opened the live account. Try to relax and forget about this week, it has been a tough week for trades. Start fresh next week. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Good morning everyone. This was a trade on the EUR/USD 4 hour chart. I forgot to make a pic of it when the trade closed so that is why you see 5 candles after the closing candle. I think many of you who took this trade ended it in a breakeven+5 or so position because of the 5th candle after the setup candle was drawn. Since I aim for larger take profit targets, I don't move my stop to BE+5 until price hits the 1:1 area. That is my rule, no the normal garfield75 rules. Have a great weekend everyone. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hi Greyfox thanks for your concern, I do appreciate your advice , I cant explain what it is.It must be a brain tumor lol if I had carried on as normal I would be in front I think it maybe because i'm looking for more reasons not to enter or reasons why I shouldn't have entered, (thinking too much) I just got to relax and let it ride. Walk away from the pc once ive set the trade, Its not the fear of cash loss. Its not as if I can lose much at 10 cents a pip ,I think its the fear of losing the game. Hard to explain , Anyway thanks again , I will try again next week Regards orid

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi orid. I highlighted part of your post in red here because I think you hit the nail on the head. You are rationalizing a contradiction of thought, It isn't the cash, its losing the game??? Isn't losing the game cash loss? If it isn't about the money then just take the trade like you were doing on demo and all should be fine. I know its Friday and I am sorry for picking on you, BUT I am concerned because I know you are better than what you have done since going live this week. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Correct my friend I will trade like a demon next week , if I can find out how a demon can trade? One thing that is bothering me is that the demo is showing a little different to live , (different signals) some of the candles are also slightly different shape , same times and all else is same weird ive sent them a screen shot with please explain ,. well I have to have some excuse.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hello orid. It is obvious your broker is using 2 different price feeds between demo and live. Your live chart looks like my live and demo charts for the 1 hour candles. However, that being said if you are trading live then ONLY look at the live chart for entries. You will drive yourself loonie if you try to make sense out of brokers reasons for doing what they do. You might want to download another Australian brokers platform and see if their demo charts match your live chart. If you find another broker who uses the same feed for live and demo you may want to switch to them for trading if it will make you feel more confident. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Yes well when I originally downloaded their demo I did ask them if it was exactly the same as I did have every intention of going live with them eventually, they assured me it was the same, exactly the same feed except for the filling of orders on live might be a little slower, as you would expect. Now to find this out after 4 months trading on a demo that is not the same at all with this system at least , well feel like four months wasted. Ill just have to buckle down forget the demo . I don't fancy checking both before every trade, probably works out pretty much the same. The fishing wasn't no good . bad week all round for me , heh we forgot the bait , had to use the lures . I want that boat you showed ,does it come with chairs? and a fish finder? All the best for the next round Regards Orid

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi orid. Don't think of it as 4 months wasted because you did learn a lot over that time. As to the demo live feed differences, its just another one of the broker anomalies that happen. I wouldn't like if it happened to me especially if I was told they were the same feed. No Bait!!! Shame on you. Fishing is like trading, never really know what will happen next. No chairs for the boat, FishFinder is a pair of goggles so you can stick your head in the water and then gurgle here fishy, fishy... A new week is on the horizon, so dust yourself off and lets do it again.... the right way. 1greyfox

Hi dbest Welcome to the thread, good luck to you. Once the bar closes on the MTF MACD signal indicator it will not repaint it. That is what is used for the basis of taking the trade. The current bar will repaint UNTIL that candle closes, then it becomes fixed. No need to change the settings when you have the AutoParams set to true in the inputs section of the indicator. 1greyfox

Hi orid. As you said it looks horrible. Even the 4 hour chart(which I trade) is in a horrible consolidation pattern also. 1greyfox

hi Greyfox , hope you are well, yep I exited that nz trade with + 1.5 pip = 8 cents profit . lol. then like a blundering idiot I pressed the sell button by mistake when I meant to change the time frame , and promptly lost 2 pips, to get out again. Don't laugh ,Trades today 1 hour 1 x half win 12 pips. and above farce. Almost back to my deposit. Regards orid

Good morning everyone. My trade for the week was a loser. It was on the CAD/JPY and lost about 53 pips. If I would have moved the stop to the BE+5 at the appropriate time that is how this trade would have ended. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hmm... Losing stakes are usually not accepted as a trading experience that has to be taken into consideration. I must admit your (garfield75) trading has no good results at all. Like it or not, trading style must rely mostly on news processing, then apply tactics of trading by technicals. Sentiment cannot be recognized unless you allow a trend to be missed.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
hi Greyfox , Sorry to see you had a loss, ive had a loss today 24 pips and a a be +5 and im in 2 more at the mo.news a coming hope it pushes me the right way.

Hi orid. Seems to be a bad week for both of us. Oh well, it happens. I won't be opening any trades because I doubt they would reach target before market close on Friday. So, it appears to be an early start to the weekend and I hear the fish calling. Enjoy the weekend. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hi ognen. If you are referring to the trade explorer results, they are based on using an EA which is still being developed. The trades aren't based on human intervention(analysis). The EA gets a signal and sets the trade up and then we wait to see what happens next. If you are referring to my results which uses different money(trade) management styles, oh well, sorry. As to losing stakes not being accepted, I have NEVER found a method that doesn't produce losing trades, so losing stakes are part of the cost of doing business. I don't understand your comment on sentiment, so I will not offer a reply because it would be based on what I think you are saying and not actually based on what you said. 1greyfox

I must say this live trading is a strange beast, Ive lost almost 200 pips in two weeks . go on the demo and made 30 pips in two hours/

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Good morning orid. It sucks going through the initial trials from demo to real, I think the main difference is that the broker doesn't manipulate the demo price feed, but will manipulate the live feed if he can earn more profits by doing so. Question(s): On some of your losing trades, would they have been winners if you didn't move the stop to a BE+ position? My thoughts are as follows; since the entry to profit target might be smaller, maybe moving the stop to BE+ after price moves 50% to target is choking your trade. What would happen if you only moved your stop up 50% to the entry price when price moved 50% in your favor? This should keep you busy over the weekend unless you are going fishing again. Remember the bait if you do go. Enjoy the weekend everyone. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #667 ---
i would recommened global prime broker. just look up the reviews on forexpeacearmy. very good, honest ECN broker, absolutely no tricks, and the only retail forex broker that will produce receipts on request for every trade in terms of whick bank/liquidity provider filled the trade

--- 帖子 #668 ---
my demo continues to perform well on 4h charts, this EA definitely has an edge in the market question to mike and garfield and anyone else who might know, please can someone explain why the EA did not take this trade on the 10th, (section just slightly below the crosshairs) , i figure it should have taken a buy on AUDJPY as all MACD's turned green? any feedback would be appreciated blam

--- 帖子 #669 ---
EAs never gave me positive results as I made tests in the past 4 years. I even have made myself application in Excel which was doing calculations on mechanical trading style, but the research reveald me that chances are 50-50 when there are no constant losers. By my opinion it is waste of time. Losing stakes are part of the trading, but not as constant losing stakes. Sentiment is not predictable, it is assumable. So, sentiment can only be recognized after the action happened, and not before. I cannot offer more help then to say follow the news and process them. Nothing is much more worth than the news, including rumors of course. Technicals are only 20% reliable when analysing, and EAs are 0%.

Good morning orid. That is really sad news, is there anything I can do to help? If you want, you can e-mail me privately and send me a few of the trade charts for me to look over. Also, let me know what your exact rules have been and we'll see if we can't work out what might be hindering you currently. 1greyfox

Thanks greyfox , my charts that i kept are on the desktop in for repair , i havent been doing anything different to when i was on demo, So I will go back to demo and try to fine tune . I have a couple ideas ideas, if I can keep to them the rules that is eh? thing that really amazes me is how quickly the price gos against you , like seconds or minute or two. yet how slow when it moves into profit, weird. Keep on truckin. Anyone else having any succes or not would be nice to hear your views. Regards Orid

Hi All, especially Garfield and those active in helping others to find their way in this thread. Thanks for sharing your system here!!! I read all contributions here. Unfortunately I was not able to realy study / practice the system as I am still enjoying my holiday; but I can' t wait to step into it. ( itś a pitty that android MT4 doesnt allow for your own mt4 tools) Tuesday I will be home and start doing the charts. My aim is to use this system together with what I have learned thus far on Supply and Demand Zones, and the use of strong S&amp;R levels from M1 W1 D1 and H4. I hope it will strengthen my way off trading. I intend to keep you informed on how it is going. And maybe, but only after using it for a while, I can contribute to this thread and the whole of this system. Regards, Ben

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi Ben welcome and good luck, Demo for me this week.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Good morning Ben. Much success to you on this new path you are about to enter. I think with some of the added things you plan to use to help decide to trade or not are beneficial. Even though a signal gets generated doesn't always mean it is worth trading and human analysis is always a good thing to do before jumping into a trade. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hi 1greyfox, Thanks for you answer and welcoming. As I said, on Tuesday I would start. Setting my charts now. In page 1 first thread there is this scheme on settings for the several tf's. I am wondering why the calculation in lower tf's is done different from the higher ones. Let me explain: As I understand we have mtf in the H4 chart of H4, D1 and W1. Therefor we need these combinations: 12, 26, 9. 72, 156, 54. 360, 780, 270. To get the 2nd series of setting we multiply 1st setting by 6 (6 times 4 hours in a day). To get 3rd series we multiply by 5 (5 days in a week). So far so good (I hope). When I compare this to the smaller tf I do not find the same way of calculating: Compared to the above, I would think in M15 we would have MACD's of M15, M30 and H1 (and therefor the multiplying by 2 and 4. What did I miss here? Regards, Ben

--- 帖子 #681 ---
What did you discover?

--- 帖子 #682 ---
So, I've read the thread. And I have one question: I didn't find in the rules a 'defined exit rule'. Do we hold until TP/SL/BE/BE+? I only ask because I want to try to have the best possible understanding I can before I crank up the magic Meta Editor and create an EA for it. Thx!

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hi Ben. Sorry for the delay in answering I was away all day today. When using the 15 minute chart and then using the 1 hour as the next higher time frame instead of the 30 minute is because there just isn't enough distance from the 15 to 30 to make the MACD's look much different. When jumping up to the 1 hour it is a multiple of 4 instead of 2 when looking at the 30 minute time frame. So, the 15 minute chart uses the 15 minute, 1 hour, 4 hour MACD's as the settings which shows a clear multiple of 4 when going from one time to the next one up. I hope I made sense in this reply, I am tired and that isn't always the best time to answer questions logically. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi nondisclosure00. Welcome to the thread and good luck to you. The normal trade rules are aiming for a 1:1 Risk/Reward ratio. If the setup candle is 30 pips in size then the trade profit target would be set 30 pips away along with a 30 pip stop loss. Good luck with your EA experiment. There is an experimental EA available in post #472 which you may want to look at. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Hello everybody, I like this trading system because it fits good for me and is similar to a my trading system ( work in progress). About macd I want test this system not with 12 26 9 setting for low TF, which in my opinion is a trap for rats, but with 8.45 - 9 - 8.40. I know I can set only 8,9,8 ...I will share the results of backtest and demo asap. Just a question for Garfield:what is the security distance from the 1200 Ma? 100 pips? The tp / sl close to the Ma? I would like have strong rule and respect it. Thanks

Hi grey. Thanks for the reply. So we are holding until a target is hit. Ok I'm sure the EA posted on #472 is a very good EA. I like to code my own, this way in only have me to blame when/if it goes wrong.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi Garfield hope you don't mind, but I thought I would bring this up for a few comments, The trade i took this morning got me 21pips, Ive noticed a few of these trades go a long way , has anyone used the hieken ashi candles to stay in .? Id be up about 70 pis at mo . anyway two trades today + 40 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Good morning sardinian and welcome to the thread. The distance from the 4 hour 1200ema(Daily 200ema) should allow at least a 1:1 Risk/Reward if you are trading towards it. As to using the MACD settings other than the ones this thread is based, may start to pollute what garfield75 has intended this thread to be. I have seen many threads die an agonizing death because postings have moved away from the original purpose. Personally, I would like to keep the thread as pure as possible, but it would be up to garfield75 to make the final decision as to how much latitude he will allow with posts. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Hi orid. Nice trade, I looked at my chart before replying and it was a painless winning trade. Congrats on sticking to your rules and trusting yourself on the live account again. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Good morning nondisclosure00. garfield75 likes to move the stop to a breakeven+(a couple of pips) when price has moved 50% to the final profit target as this has worked well for him, so I would start there and then decide if you are comfortable with his criteria for trade management. I prefer aiming for larger profit targets so my trade manage rules are different than what is generally accepted, that is why you will always see a disclaimer when I post a trade chart stating my different rules. Looking at the results garfield75 has using his money management style it obviously works. Good luck on your coding efforts. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Hello orid. Instead of adding indicators to the chart, why not try increasing your take profit settings? Since you don't know how far price will move until after it has moved that distance, how can you be sure if the heiken ashi(lagging indicator that HIDES your price bars) would have given you more profits compared to just setting a larger take profit target(human analysis)? Hindsight is always 20/20 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #693 ---
sorry for my ignorance greyfox ,i didnt think the heikan candles were adding an indicator , more to changing the way we look at the price direction , if the candles stay same colour the trend is still in same direction? and lagging ? i thought they show exact same other than colour and shape . Not sure ive grasped the heiken ashi concept properly back to my studies. apologies for bringing this up , regards orid ps i should have stayed out of the market last two weeks as you suggested. while the mess was going on

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hi orid. No apologies needed, we ALL suffer from the "lets add another indicator to filter" syndrome, I am guilty of it way too often. Now that the mess is over(temporarily) I think we will start to see better setups coming our way til the holiday season arrives when things naturally slow down again. Over the 5 years I have been trading, I learned that when things are totally not normal it is best to protect my capital by not trading. It gives me time then to do some backtesting or reading, or best of all get some fishing time in. Have an awesome day. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Good morning orid. Glad you realized the trade wasn't going to work and cut the loss quickly. I was trying some different settings for the 1 hour chart this week using the EA in hopes that it would show decent results. In my final analysis, no matter what settings are used, I believe human intervention is still needed in making a trade decision instead of just relying on the current version of the EA to make the trades. I will adjust the MTF_MACD_Signal indicator to my test settings and when I get a signal I will check the chart and then decide if it worth taking or not. I will also attach the same indicator on the same chart using the standard settings to see how much the signal alert varies. So, basically, you could say I goofed off all week. I hope your 4 hour trades are working out well and will wait to hear your results even though you did break the rules. I e-mailed you a few days ago and you haven't replied. Talk to you later and have a great weekend my friend. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Good morning orid or should I say Secret Agent Man? I do hope they work for you. I had a EUR/JPY trade running which got stopped out at BE+5. Other than that I have been doing more studying on what we discussed privately. I guess that makes me a Secret Agent Man also! It is disheartening that garfield75 hasn't been around to post any charts of his trades(successful or not) and today is the last day that the demo EA's will be working. It is beginning to appear like a deserted ghost town(Halloween joke) around here. Maybe the ghouls will bring this thread back to life, or better yet, you posting hundreds of winning trade charts. Hopefully, I will get some posted also. Have a great day and much success to you my friend. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Good morning blamshakk. Thanks for providing an update on your progress, it is good to see that not everyone has abandoned the thread. Garfield75 uses the filter of being too close or on the 1200ema(daily 200ema) for not entering a trade. I added a 200ema on the 4 hour chart and use that as an additional visual filter for entering or not entering a trade, same reasoning as used for the 1200ema. I also look to see if are near a double/triple top or bottom before entering a trade. Basically, if I can't get a comfortable minimum of 1:1 I skip the trade and look elsewhere. On the EUR/JPY which I got stopped out on for a BE+5, would have been a full win if I just aimed for the 1:1 Risk/Reward instead of looking for more. So, if I just followed the 1:1 rule instead of aiming for more then I might be doing better in the win column. Have a great day. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hi orid. Looking at my chart it appears this one didn't move in your direction as you planned. Since the setup candle didn't offer at least a 1:1 Risk/Reward before reaching yesterdays low, this trade would have been questionable for me. I guess this could be another filter for you to use. The same could be said if it was near yesterdays high, if no easy 1:1, no trade. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Good morning everyone. Looking at the current list of pending orders at 9AM eastern time October 31,2013(attached pic), the only one that makes any sense is the GBP/NZD(pic attached) because it isn't near the 1200ema(daily200ema) or extended beyond the ADR of the setup candle. Attached Image I am attaching the 4 hour chart of the AUD/CHF which should not have had a pending order triggered because it is at the 1200ema(daily 200ema) and no 1:1 Risk/Reward is present. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Good call on this orid. I would have skipped it because of the size of the upper wick and also because that wick set the weekly high, it will be interesting to see if that remains the high or it gets broken to end the week, then a possible big gap down on the Sunday night open to trap all the long holders who didn't close their trades before market close. 1greyfox

you describe things much better than me Greyfox, thankyou although i actually try not to worry too much on resistances too much, the trade before that went for around 50 was similar circumstances also im not sure if sometime it pays to turn a blind eye , from my vey limited experience. but then again live trading is another story , Ive made around450 pips this week after losses and commission on demo, as you would expect , , definately a different kettle of fish. if you pardon the expression, did you have fish for breakfast yet? regards Orid

--- 帖子 #721 ---
hey orid sounds like you are doing some good work, we would appreciate if after your testing you can share your findings. personally i have run the EA stock settings, apart from 0.2 lots, on a £1000 demo since sept 24th. here is a pic of the results. bear in mind i am running 24/5 no intervention. as you can see large gains are then given back? if i could replicate the success of the trade explorer for the MTF ea on this page then that would be great, good to see it doing well garfield.

Well, I've got the EA written. I've loaded it up to forward test. Not sure how to post live updates on trades and the such so, I'll just have to post manually. I did back test this on EURUSD 4H.

Hi everyone. On the current list of pending orders which were setup on Nov. 7, 2013 9AM eastern time, only one would be considered by me as a possible trade. Attached Image The CAD/JPY is the only one on the list that hasn't blown out the ADR. Are we using the ADR or aren't we using it as a criteria for setting up pending orders? I don't know what the current garfield75 rules are because he hasn't posted any trades or given direction where this thread is supposed to be heading. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi garfield75. I just noticed the trade log and saw an odd thing. There were 3 duplicate trades placed. Needless to say with all the red letter news that was released the last couple of days, the Trade explorer account took a beating. The other morning it was up over 100% gain for the year, and in just a couple of days it is down to 64.7%. To me this demonstrates the need for human intervention instead of just letting a so called 'expert' advisor do the thinking for you. Sad to see a loss of over 34% on the account because of trusting a piece of software. 1greyfox

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Hey Greyfox, Those trades were duplicated due to "human intervention" .. I had to restart my VPS and MT4 terminals. So the EA added those pending trades again, which triggered. I was checking all my live accounts to make sure they were correct and didn't bother checking the demo account. Another way of looking at this is 60%+ gain in the account in 3 months with minimal trading time. How many system out there can beat this ? Cheers Garfield

Hi garfield75, What if I increase the risk a little bit more in order to get 25%-30% a month? Do you think it is going to work with this system?

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Also, I am wondering if I try to put a more tight stop loss and target a reward a little bigger, let's say 100 pips? Do you think it is possible to get better results?

--- 帖子 #752 ---
you can give it a go, but that will be a variation of the system. what will be your rule of "Tight stoploss". Also 100 pips across all pair ?

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Hi december is not good month for testing any system... results obtained can vary from any other month of the year...

--- 帖子 #754 ---
ah,"this ea has expired ".

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I tried to backtest this EA on a demo account on ironFX MT4. I placed the MTF MACD Signal v1.1.ex4 into C:\Program Files (x86)\IronFX MetaTrader 4\experts and 3colorMACD.mq4 into C:\Program Files (x86)\IronFX MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators But it kept show "ArrayInitialize function internal error" and no trade was triggered when testing. Tried google but no luck. Anyone can help?

--- 帖子 #756 ---
i think that EA has expired, which is why it's causing the error. I don't have the source code for it, so can't post it.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
this system looks more stable on daily charts

--- 帖子 #758 ---
my trade explorer here is linked to an EA which trades based on same rule on 4 hours chart. Anyone want to use the EA please PM me.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Here is the Ea that will work on Demo and Live accounts until 28th February 2014. Please test and report bugs to me. If you have success with the EA please post your settings. Skyline100 it looks like the indicator may not have complied correctly when MT4 loaded, closing and re opening usually helps. Hope this Helps Mike

--- 帖子 #760 ---
started trading the EA on live account today!!! Let's see how this performs!!

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Wish you all the best! Q: Can I keep the EA running for 24 hours instead of 1 to 8? My Broker is GMT+0 which means that I will be trading only the Asian session if I stick to 1-8 only. Advise pls. Q: If I am not sure if my broker is ECN or not, what should I select? (I phoned them to inquiry but as you know, they have no clue). Q: Please share your LIVE trading on one of the explorers so that we observe how things are going. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #762 ---
yes, the EA runs 24 hours doesn't ,matter with broker being ECN or NOT My live result is already is linked with forex factory trade explorer.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
garfield, when i tried the EA, i noticed that SL was set to the lowest of the swing, not the low of the triggering candle. TP was set to NOTHING - unset. The trade was a LONG one of course. Is that behavior normal from the EA? Can you send your LIVE parameter settings pls.? [copy and paste]

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Thank you magft, I will try to backtest it as soon as possible.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hey Guys, Can someone please tell me that, does indicator repaints the past signals? I know it is not a repainting indicator on live trading, but what about back-tests? can this indicator repaints the signals which was generated in past?

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hey Garfield, I'm happy to see that this thread became so frequented. I didn't follow it for a while. A couple of questions: 1)Is the EA you are using on the live account attached to this thread, the one posted on post #759? 2)Are you closing positions manually or is all executed by EA? 3)How many pairs are you trading? 4)Are you still trading 4H timeframe or you switched to another? Many thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #767 ---
as far as I know this Indi doesn't repaint once the candle is closed.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
1)Is the EA you are using on the live account attached to this thread, the one posted on post #759? -- I havn't posted this EA, it follows the same rule for trade entry. 2)Are you closing positions manually or is all executed by EA? -- All executed by the EA, I have an condition set, once floating profit reaches 5.0% of the account equity, the EA will close all open positions. 3)How many pairs are you trading? --- 16 pairs -- AUDCHF,AUDUSD,CADCHF,CHFJPY,EURAUD,EURJPY,EURNZD,EURUSD,GBPAUD,GBPCAD,GBPCHF,GBPUSD,NZDUSD,USDCAD,USDCHF,USDJPY 4)Are you still trading 4H timeframe or you switched to another? --- Only 4 hours

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Many thanks for your reply. I love the idea for your exits. How did you choose your pairs (and why you don't trade for example EUR/AUD or EUR/GBP etc...) ? Do you think you will share your EA? Thanks again. Love this simple system

--- 帖子 #770 ---
After 5 months on demo with 290 trades these pairs performed the best so I am using these in the live account. I am not posting it on the forum, can send a copy if you are interested, please PM me your email.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
I've PMed you. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #772 ---
The strategy looks simple and powerful!

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Helpppp, I have the MACD's on a chart, but they are of one color. Can someone explain how to 'download' and how to attach it to a chart so I can create a template. I thank you in advance. Reno

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Hi Garfield Could you please send me your EA? My e-mail ID: gupta_pramod@yahoo.com . Somehow I am not able to PM you. With regards, Pramod

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Garfield, I think that your EA would do better if it opens only ONE trade per 4-8 hours, why? In order to avoid closely correlated pairs. Apart from EURUSD vs. USDJPY, most of the remaining pairs are correlated. This will also lower the drawdown of the account, i.e., lowering the risk. What do you think? Review the statement of the 5-months demo and see for yourself that multiple pairs where triggered almost in the same minute.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
How would you chose which to open and which to discard? If you want to avoid correlations problems, you can share the risk between all the trades you are going to open. For example if you want to risk 2% on a single trade and you have to open 4 position at the same time, you can open each position with 0.5% of risk.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Have you received the EA from Garfield? I've PMed him without reply.... Maybe he's on holliday.... Happy new year everyone

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Hi Lucariga Happy New Year 2014. I think we can test the EA posted by Mike on Post # 759. The EA is valid till Feb 28th only. I tested the Garfield's 4H manual system on 16 pairs. Closed 6 trades this week with 100% success rate. Maybe, I will try the EA next week. I am going to use the Garfield75 script for my 4H manual trading next week. Does the EA work on 4H or 1H TF and do I need to upload the EA on all the 16 pairs I want to trade or only one pair? With regards, Pramod

--- 帖子 #779 ---
I think you should use it on all pairs. How did you take profit? at 1:1 R:R or as soon as all floating positions reached +5%? To summarize: 1) you wait for all 3 macd became same color 2) If the 200 ema is not between your entry point and your TP, you pull the trigger 3) Where you place your SL? 4) Where you place your TP? Thanks

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I placed the pending orders when all 3 MACDs became same color at 4H charts and took profit with 1:1 R:R. My SL was set at low or high of previous 4H candle.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Did you mind of the 200 EMA?

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Not really. I have started using the EA yesterday and it opened its 1st trade with 0.04 lots. It should have opened only 0.01 lot as defined in the input tab. Can any one tell me the reason?

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Garfiled75, What kind of manual intervention you are making to the EA's trading? I ran my EA at the exact time of your Live, but your Live account is making profit (almost 12%) while my EA is barely reaching 1% (floating yet). I do recall that you manually close all open trades once the profits reach 5%. Are you still adopting this rule? Any more intervention?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
If you specify the Risk parameter, the lots will be computed automatically, not as you specify.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
no manual intervention, the EA has the setting enabled to close all trades when it's 5% in profit. I only reboot the VPS on the weekend, otherwise just let it run.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
I have sent the EA to all who have requested it. here are my setting of the EA.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
My aim is to keep it simple and easy, don't like to over complicate rules, if I can get return of 10% a month for spending just 10 min on the weekends to reboot my system, I am happy... here is the link to myfxbook of the trade results for anyone interested to analyse the trades. http://www.myfxbook.com/members/garf...ea-demo/652035 cheers

--- 帖子 #788 ---
How to get the latest version of the EA please? I sent you a private message with my email. Thanks Garfield.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
garfield75, I got the EA! Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Hi Garfield, Is this the same EA which you have shared with other members at FF?? Can I also please have a copy of the EA to backtest, live test.. I am also based in Australia, where are you from? Thanks. Ravs

--- 帖子 #791 ---
No problem! ! Send me your email. I am from Sydney! ! Cheers

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hi Garfield75, Thanks for your mail. Just starting demo trading now. EA opened 3 trades tonight on CHFJPY, EY and UJ, although 200 MA was in the way to TP. Is that filter not included in the EA ?

--- 帖子 #793 ---
EA doesn't take 200 MA in consideration. I had 200 MA filter in my manual trading, after seeing the result of the EA, it doesn't make much difference on overall performance. Please run the EA on 4 hours chart with 15 pairs only - AUDCHF,AUDUSD,CADCHF,CHFJPY,EURAUD, EURJPY,EURNZD,EURUSD,GBPAUD,GBPCAD, GBPCHF,GBPUSD,NZDUSD,USDCAD,USDCHF I am running the above pairs on demo and live account.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
OK. Thanks. My broker does'nt have GBPCAD and GBPAUD. Substituted them by AUDNZD and UJ.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Nope, just trade 13 pairs.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Any specific reason for that ? I delete UJ to have just 2 yen pairs, but AN seems doing fine on a visual backtest. By the way, could you explain how the EA calculates the position size ? I have Max Risk set at 3%, but EA takes 2% positions...

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Everyone who is running the ea, please feel free to post your comments, experience and observations.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Here is myfx link to my demo account: https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/mt4-518890/803918 So far, break even. I have noticed that there were some trades that the EA did'nt enter I don't know why. Is there any other filter included other than the mínimum 25 pips range ? And Garfield, would you be so kind to answer to the questions I posted here above (position size and AUDNZD) ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Good morning friends, I am Brazilian I run the 07 years ... I would like to send me your Template EA so I could do the tests ... if possible ... my email is robinhocarneiro@ig.com.br Success

--- 帖子 #801 ---
can't access your myfxbook link, is that set as public ? I don't think I tested the AUDNZD, I don't trade that pair so didn't even think of testing it at all. there are no filters beside the min pip range. cheers

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Sorry, forgot to set it public. Now it is. Will report you live any trade not taken by the EA. Could you please explain the max risk property of the EA ?

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Here an example of trade not taken by the EA. Entry should have been on the first hour following the signal bar. Any clue ? Anyone with the same issue ?

--- 帖子 #804 ---
My observation: When it opens a position at Support (going Short) or Resistance (going LONG), the probability of losing that trades is high. Either we can use a filter for not trading at S/R level or wait for one more candle after turning all 3 candles of same color.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
My observation # 2: Like a filter for minimum candle size of 25 pips, there should be a filter for maximum candle size, maybe 75 pips and above, which is due to any good or bad news. By the time the EA opens a position after a long candle, it is time to go in other direction.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
garfield 04/02 On- GBP / CAD signal was why you did not open. I looked Trade report he more than anyone else to bring profits. P.S Once again, excuse my bad English.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
garfield you only H4 trade or use any other time. I looked at opening its orders, there are different time. for example GBP/CHF Sell 1.4725 1.473510:1 -0.6%-9 ( your last order to open М15)? Why do you ignore some signals for example GBP/CAD there is a signal and you just opened on GBP/CHF? Why?

--- 帖子 #808 ---
This simply doesn't work, which is why no one posts anymore, having checked manually all this years possible trades to reassure myself, between EU, GU UJ and AU there have been 61 trades as per the original rules, 20 have won, 19 have lost and 22 have broke even. If you'd like to disagree and prove otherwise fine, but I wouldn't even think about using an EA when the 'system' itself doesn't even work.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
I'm just wondering why some do not pay attention to the signal such as yesterday's signal for GBP / CAD was false. Maybe I'm doing something wrong

--- 帖子 #810 ---
I looked at the monthly analitics there is profit in December. Just wondering why some signals he is not paying attention.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Hello to everyone. Is the EA still available for test? Somebody go on with the back test,what about the result? Thanks

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Sorry for the previous message. The EA is in the first page. Anyone still use it? What about the performance and best setting/Pairs? Thanks

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Dear sir : may i get the ea .....thanks!!

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Anyone still trading the manual version of this strategy?

--- 帖子 #815 ---
i am interested in your posts and was wondering if possible to get the ea. also as i trade on an ecn account which has five decimals if that might affect trading your style. and i notice in the month of trades you were showing that all trades are in tens or five. eg 45, 100 would this not affect how correct the top profit and stop profit can be. this is nit picking i know as you have perfected this and would love you opinion thanks chris

What would be the Monthly value MACD on 4H ? So I want to see the 4H chart, but have the values of the Daily, Weekly and Monthly below for Daily it's 72 156 54, for Weekly it's 360 780 270, how about Monthly on a 4H Chart? How do I work it out ?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Thanks Garfield it is a good method! I am trading US index futures, for many years I was working on the concept of "Triple Screen" or Dow Theory or Fractal markets, you name it. Once had bought a method from Watt Trading Group which had a similar idea but it was missing the third and larger trend time frame (TF) MACD. In that system it was used the MACD 5-34-5 EMAs on closing basis, he was using it in 1 or 3 minutes for scalping the NASDAQ, and I was trying to work this idea on the Daily - Weekly - Monthly with that MACD. Your MACD is the default one perhaps but I am sorry I cannot understand why the vast majority of trading community is using a such laggard timing tool! However it has become a self - fulfilling prophecy because so many are using it. I would like to trade the trend with your idea, but using different parameters for the MACD inspired by the W. Colby book which deals with testing indicators and optimising them. Then in order to trade the trend as I would like to I had to find a technical tool that tells me somehow that from now on is not worthy to trade anymore - momentumwise - the market. So i delved into the Force Index (2) and (13) in order to have a balance on my indicators those deriving from price and time and those deriving from volume price and time. I used the guidelines set by its creator Dr. Al. Elder. Every time I saw FI(2) or/and FI(13) diverging accordingly I was tightening my stops not on the daily but on the 4 hour or even on the 1 hour time frame. I am also using the MACD histogram (or difference) for adding on to my position and for divergences or when it slopes on the opposite direction is an alarm call. Since in Forex you do not have a plot of volume from direct volume data in order to have the Force Index (2 &amp; 13), you should plot the MACD histogram (Default values you use) and when it starts to bend by sloping on the opposite direction should tight stops in a lower time frame. It is a matter to investigate if anyone from this thread is interested in researching. thanks again!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi, could you show in the graph some example with the two rsi? I think that despite the macd's delay, it is better to be late than wrong.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Brilliant. I wish I came across such wisdom 6 years ago when I started trading!
