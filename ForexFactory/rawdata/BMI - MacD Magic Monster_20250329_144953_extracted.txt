Everybody knows what MacD is right? But have you ever thought about what the zero line is? Once you KNOW what the zero line actually is, then MacD takes on a whole new meaning and becomes a powerful indicator. Have you ever wondered why the MacD is showing Up, Moving from well below the zero line upwards towards the zero line but still the price is dropping? Some say it is divergence and it indicates ... blah blah blah. But what this actually means is, lets find a way of saying something that sounds valid because surely it WILL go up since MacD shows up...? As you can see in this picture, The price is heading south while MacD (the standard one in the indicators tab just slightly better colour settings) set to 12,26,9 . Also the zero Line is a thick blue line. http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/658/macd1.png Now the following picture Has some EMA's on it. EMA 47 (12+26+9) EMA 14 (26-12) EMA 2 (12-9)/2 http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/4092/macd2.png Not an exact replica of the MacD, but very close no? Just to fully embed this concept in your mind, the next pic has the same value EMA's in a separate window. So Now we have a slanted MacD that doesn't give the false impression of moving up, when the zero line is not actually a horizontal line but is an EMA. Yet since we see it as a straight line in the MacD, our natural tendency is to perceive that anything that is below it that moves up is actually moving up. http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/3003/macd3.png By zooming out to max it becomes very simple to fully perceive the right way of what MacD shows us. The orange line in the MacD appears below as a non contradictory downward trend. The vertical white lines are the crossover points on the MacD and also on the EMA version of the same Macd. So by seeing the trend, one need not panic and close the short trade just because the MacD is heading north. It can simply be seen that each touch of the 'zero' line is still lower than the previous touch. http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/4109/macd4.png

Now we get to an interesting MacD that shows us even more. It is a long term MacD, and it took me almost 2 years of experimentation to find the right numbers (EMA's actually). 75,365,60 - A pretty strange MacD, yes? http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/7629/macd5.png Here is the MacD (75,365,60) As well as the EMA's EMA 500 (75+365+60) EMA 290 (365-75) EMA 8 (75-60)/2 (rounded up) http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/609/macd6.png And here on the Weekly chart are the two together. That is 8800 pips (as you will see in the next pic is actually conservative) with basically zero drawdown over ten years. That is also excluding the medium term trades that happen while the long term trade grows and grows. Rollover fee's I hear you thinking? There are several brokers that offer their services with zero swap fee's. Risk Reward ratio? As I will show you, the risk is almost zero, while the reward. Well let us say it is fairly reasonable. http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/7246/macd7.png 1. The price drops to test EMA 290, but fails to break through. Prior to that it was testing to break above EMA 500 also failing to break through. Notice that EMA 47 (the red one) fails to turn South. Without counting the 4500 pip in the one year from the bar that almost touches EMA 290 after the two that tested to the LowerHigh where number 2 is, we get our first signal that a reversal is in the offer. 2. Our second signal comes from the turning of the EMA 47. 3. Our entry point and third signal that reversal has happened is the testing to break above EMA 47 that fails. The exit point of the first short is where she breaks above EMA 47. This is also the entry for the long position. http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/451/macd8.png 4. There is one point halfway up the long trade where EMA 47 turns South but they are 3 short scallops that end with a higher low. If the Higher low were to have been a Lower Low, it would have broken below EMA 290 which would be our exit signal. Also EMA 290 had not turned South. The gap between EMA 47 was still hugging EMA 290. If however at that time we were to decide to close the tradeas soon as we saw EMA turn South, it was at 2100 Pips a few weeks after EMA 290 turned South, and we would open a new trade on first test and bounceback off EMA 600. http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/7954/macd9.png 5. The gap here between the High at 5, and EMA 500 is now at 5000 Pips. It is getting homesick. Directly below 5. is the first Lower Low since the 4. testing for southbound territory. Imediately after 5, EMA 290 starts to turn. Once the price breaks below EMA 47 a tries to break back above and fails is a good exit point. After this trade is finished, the break below EMA 500 is the entry for the next short. This excludes the many bounces off the EMA 500, EMA 290 ans EMA 47 Weekly 'scalps' of around 1500 to 300 pips each that are evident and give clear signals after failing to break the various resistance points. Then phase two of the system is to do the same on the daily chart, the H4, the H1 all the way down to the M15. These two "MacD's" (which actually ARE MacD's but aren't since they are EMA's are true magic EMA's. If you think I am joking, check em out. I am attaching the indicators for them, and you will see that the separate window EMA's have 6 EMA's in them using 3 for background and three for colour. Doing it this way leaves the two 'MacD's' floating, so the touch/test points should only be done on the chart itself. OR you can set up both MacD's in ONE separate window indicator. You work out the details. Enjoy. BlueMental.

And here are the indicators. Please excuse that these are back to front, since I had to split them to get all the pics in. (sorry Admin, but only once and they were needed)

--- 帖子 #4 ---
hi BM sorry but i cant see the picture...

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Blue, R u using " Save as Picture" in the file menu and then uploading the screen shots? Pat

--- 帖子 #6 ---
where is the pic?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
yeah... there is no pic here. please upload the pics again

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Ummm. I used the link option with Image shack, then from image shack I copied the 'forum' text (had url details on it). Now I tried uploading it directly (the pics wont be in the right place, but at least they should be there. &lt;EDIT&gt; Sorry about that everyone, I am not (rephrase WAS not) familiar with getting pics in my posts. Prior to this I just uploaded them and they all end up at the end of the post. It seems odd to me that it has an 'insert image' option that does not work, while a simple copy paste of the embed url version does the trick. Anyway, we live and learn. Ps, the long pause of no action was me finally falling asleep at the desk while trying to set this up. (I did another one of those 48 hours forex trading stints, and got a bit dozy.) &lt;/EDIT&gt;

nice one .you find it macd and ma are very useful and powerful tools if you put them together and trade it skilly . many people just think those two are lagging indicator becose they don't really know how to use them . i made 800-1000 pips in euro every month since 6 years ago,only using those two "lagging indicators. sounds impossible ,hmm.but it is true. congratulation ,i believe you will make huge pips .

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Bluemental your take on MACD and MA combo is brilliant. I've always been a fan of classic technical analysis principles. Will follow this thread with interest. Keep up the good work and thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi FxHermit and Mac + Ma (a very apt name for this thread) if you want to find some interesting info regarding the bounce off EMA's and round numbers (all SR levels) go check The Dance at this link http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...&amp;goto=lastpage It ties in a great deal with the MacD/MA methodology posted here. Only a pleasure.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
There is no magic about MACD. It is simply subtraction of the two moving averages and then smothing it. For example MACD 12,26,9 means we see the difference of EMA 12 and EMA 26 (white histogram - how far is EMA 12 from EMA 26), the second line is 9 period MA of that difference, also called as signal line (red line in MACD indicator window). So, when MACD crosses zero line, it is exacltly the same thing as EMA 12 and EMA 26 crossover. When you see price slowly dropping and MACD shows "uptrend" it means nothing else than the two EMAs are getting closer to each other as the EMAs difference is getting smaller.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Exactly the point and seeing the zero line in it's horizontal format stops people knowing that. The zero line develops it's own EMA (as you can see if you look at my pictures) If you do not see how the Lows,Highs,Opens and Closes of the Bars bounce off the EMA 500, 290 and 47, and how those same EMA's constrain the Price Actions, then you are not seeing the MacD Monster Magic at work. It is all about perspecive. BlueMental

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This last signal has been a beauty. Good for about 150 pips so far and it looks like it's still going some more. The signal prior to this one was no slouch either. Yup, it is all about perspective .

--- 帖子 #15 ---
A very dynamic way of looking at true price action.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi Bluemental, Just curious, the moving averages are refered to as EMA's but the indicators are calculated as SMA's ??? Am I correct in that?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
As a swing trader I make a lot of use of the H4 as a set up timeframe. So, I thought that I would see how this methodology holds up with the way that I usually like to draw my channels and trendlines. Impressive! The signals are pretty well spot on .

--- 帖子 #18 ---
When cycled down into an H1 trigger chart, I have no complaints either. At this early stage of BlueMental presenting this methodology, I dare say, that it looks like it has the potential to be a very profitably trading approach. Gotta love good old classic principles of technical analysis, especially when they are applied in such a creative manner.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Here is a little Asian session scalp. Entry on the M5. Maybe it will develop legs, maybe it won't, price has dropped a long way in the last 24 hr. but there still seems to be some empty air under it. Doesn't matter one way or the other because profit stop is currently at +14 . I am liking the straight forward simplicity of this method.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thanks for sharing this with us, you sir are onto something...big.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Blue Metal, Can you please post our template? Also you trade off the main chart or the indicator window? I am a bit confused. If you can write down the rules that would be great...offcourse if you dont mind me asking Thanks

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi fxhermit. I'm glad you see the waves. To quote another one from Frank Herbert, 'It is not dificult at all to find the balance. You have to feel the wave.' When I get a bit of spare time, I will write up some stuff on how to read this monster. She is a sweetheart of note if you know how to hear what she says. One other amazing thing (at least it is amazing for me) that I learnt from Clay in 'The Dance' strategy, was the powerful S/R relationship that round numbers have. I never even THOUGHT in terms of numbers before, for me it is all about pattern and flow, and one number is just like any other. Yet once it was brought to my attention, it finally clicked in my head why so many of my trades went sour when they looked perfect. They hit the round number barrier and reversed! I hope you have set the separate window indicator as all 6 numbers combined, otherwise it seems like they are crossing while they actually are not. They have a different hight scale. I prefer to use the on chart version myself. I no longer even LOOK at the candlesticks much at all. Just the wicks sticking out is enough. Later. I'm glad you like.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Sorry for that Flea on Elephant, when I originally coded it, they were SMA's, but I found them do be lacking. so I went through the whole range, (SMA,EMA,Smoothed,Linear Weighted AND set for open,close,high,low,median,typical and I couldnt do weighted close, cos I couldnt find the calc for it) but I tried it on the main chart with linear weighted. They all had some points better than others, but EMA was most consistant, so I stuck with EMA. Just forgot to change it in the IndexLabel names. They are EMA's.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi FutureAce, don't feel bad, I am always confused. If you look at the pictures of the original post and check the comments on the pictures themselves, those are the main things to look for. The rules are so simple it is frightening. The first five pictures are done in that way so that you can comfortably grasp the similarity between the EMA's and the MacD. It is almost incredible how the EMA periods work with ANY MacD and the calculations in that text. The BigMac &lt;GRIN&gt; 75,365,60 I found through lots and lots of trial and error. The basic rule is this... If the Orange and yellow numbers cross below the red line and stay there for 4 or 5 bars, go short. if the Red line drops below the thick Purple and Indigo lines, you can set a trade up to go short and literally go on holiday until the Orange and Yellow cross above the Red line. Once that Red line changes direction, from a downward trend and turns upwards, get out of the trade. Also the further the Red line moves away from the purple line, the closer it gets to turning. Things never like to be too far from 'home'. I hope that helps you a bit. Try it out with them on demo or backtesting to get the feel for it. Zoom out quite a lot so you can see the bigger picture. If the price is above or below one of the EMA's, they are stong Resistance Support area's. Things bounce off them and strugle to btreak through them. Enough for now. BMI

There is more.... I call em Tarzan and Spiderman it is a distinct way the data arranges itself that actually shows when it wil reverse. This T&amp;S is not directly related to the monster, but in the end all things are connected so all are related. It doesn't show the pic while replying, so i'm going to look at it and edit further in this reply. It is zoomed in too much for me to clearly see the pattern, but I would say that she will swing up within 12 to 15 bars from where she is in that pic to touch at the very least the bottom EMA, then as it starts to look like she is ranging, another scallop will start. Drop further and then more or less range till a slow up begins. The upsurge will go above your current position, but you do not need to stress, it is very rare to reverse after only one swing. I would stay in that position till it becomes clear that you are breaking above 47. I will write up on the Tarzan Spiderman thing (which is actually a bad name since both Tarzan AND Spiderman swing!) at a later stage.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Bluemental, Could you post some pictures including your explanations in it? Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I have not yet managed to gather up enough patience to actually draw the lines and channels. It is really dumb of me, because they too offer clear entry and exit points with low risk. But somehow my mind wanders off to other pastures when I contemplate drawing them. Weird... but such is life.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Sorry for the late response. I agree with you, you get those that say 'this indicator lags' or 'that indicator lags'. Duuuhhh... ALL indicators lag, including the graph itself, it is a history of the past. If we were to only get a non recordable number in front of our eyes, we would need to recall the history of what it was before it is now to know if it is higher or lower than before. That is a lagging indicator! One of the beauties of Moving Averages is that the HAVE to turn. If they go only up, it is an exponential curve, and no trade price can go up faster than it's average. Just like walking paths and rivers, they sway, not like created road with laser straight lines. In fact, there is no such thing as a straight line, only the theory of it. I'm glad you like. Thank you for the compliment.

An interesting way to contemplate averages is like this. A very young child, never goes further than an arms length away from her mother. Then she begins to crawl, and the distance gets a little further. Then she grows up a bit more and goes to school, and the interaction between her and her mother get further apart, but still they both move towards each other and share space. Then she gets married and moves away from home and the difference gets further. By this stage, as the mother starts growing older, she does not deviate as much from her path as she used to. When she was her daughters age, it was rock concerts and going to the beach. Now it is a nice relaxing weekend at home reading or knitting. Her wave pattern becomes more gradual. While her daughter's path hovers around hers. Her path and her husbands path are similarly gradual curves, they touch and cross WAY less frequently then they used to during their honeymoon days. The grandfather's path is almost straight! He wastes almost zero energy going left or right. His path hardly deviates, the younger ones by nature deviate their paths to not bowl him over. So too are the MA's of the price of things. There is no 'always', only tendencies. It valuable if one can begin to recognise the alteration in the mood, which is after all what is the driving force of the tendencies. Our moods get altered by the price formation, and it's formation gets altered by our mood. Which one creates the other? They are simbiotic in nature. They are not made of the same stuff, but they drive each other by their very nature. Just like the tick chart 'creates' the M1, which 'creates' the M5 etc... This is not true, they flow and are built of the same cloth. The tick prices are alterred by the patterns of it's 'elders' (the M5, M34. M3000 etc.) Yet the 'elders' can in no way at all deny altering their flow and movement in the direction of the young ones. There is no magic in kissing a young lady. If that is the case then one would marry the first gal that he met, and she would be content since there is nothing more than 1+1 = 2? So when you look at the data, wether it be in traditional channels and trends or pivot points or fiblines or 'no' indicator at all, try to look for the 'feel' of the data. It speaks if we can only learn how to listen. We all listen in different ways, but the important part is to realise that we form the data, just as the data forms us. If you try to 'win' at forex, you can only lose. Life is not something you beat. BMI

BlueMental, thanks for your replies and am looking forward to your upcoming explanations on Spiderman and Tarzan (I write movie scripts as a hobby so your making my day here ). You wrote, "I hope you have set the separate window indicator as all 6 numbers combined, otherwise it seems like they are crossing while they actually are not. They have a different hight scale. " I am not quite sure what you mean here. I have Bg MacD on the chart(changed the colours a bit) and Sm MacD below. Does that mean Sm MacD may not read accurately in conjunction with the BG MacD? I'm with you on the Round numbers. Round number awareness has been part of my Swing trading methodology for a long time now. Glad to hear that you have also "discovered" them and find them useful. The attached chart shows EURUSD with a nice close below the 1.2950 round number and the Sm MacD confirming with support found at the 1.2800 round number. I often use them as profit taking targets and for stop loss manegement. Good stuff.

"An interesting way to contemplate averages is like this. A very young child, never goes further..........." Terrific analogy .... are you sure you don't work for Hollywood as well? (could be a movie in there)

I'm not sure how clear the arrows are on this pic but you should be able to see them. It is intentionally zoomed out so you can see it's history. if you load up the same time on your program you will see the history a bit further back. It is not quite a natural pattern. It is basically straight, a slow and steady up trend. it spikes upwards around 03:30 (Malta Time, which is 3 hours ahead of GMT) and you can see it fails to break above MA 500. The second try does not break the MA 290 which is below 500, third try bursts above both for a short time and drops below. Then the 4th time it barely breaks above 500, to make a Lower High. At the third try, the Red MA curved definatively downward, but it was too sharp a breakthrough for me to trust. Kind of like she was sleepwalking and jolted awake suddenly. After the 4th attempt to break above, 47 started a slow gentle curve downwards. The natural curve shape, not a slap in the face type spike like you get from news. The price drops below the 2 big ma's which are so close they are almost touching, and snuggled in the center of the two is the round number (see the dotted horizontal line...) at 143.50 (the zero's and their halves are Round Numbers. Then on the final attempt to break above, the price has yto break through ALL the MA's combined and the round number. Highly unlikely, but possible. So I wait. It touches 500 and bounces off. That is my signal to enter the short. I wait a little more just for clarity, then I enter. I missed the correct exit point, which was the bounce off 142.00 (a round number) Why did I miss it? because I was greedy hoping it would break through to continue the drop. But at that stage realise that the distance on the chart between the price and the nearest MA (not the yellow one, that is never far, like the mother and her baby), the FireBrick 14, is very far, which is a clear signal for a retrace at least. So my greed cut off a good few pips off my trade. I waited till the next down and exited. If the high prior to my exit broke above the Red 47, that is a good sign to get outa there FAST. It would most likely not burst through and continue, usually third test gets through, so there is time to wait for her do go lower first. but don't hang on too long, or she gets upset with you and shoots into the sky like a rocket ship cos you did not apreciate her gifts. &lt;GRIN&gt; BMI &lt;EDIT&gt; Oh, I forgot to mention, 92 pips on that one, not bad at all. &lt;EDIT/&gt;

Yeah, I'm a bit lazy in that regard as well, that's why I like the Andrew Pitchfork tool, let's me draw the channels quickly. I don't always stick to the Pitchfork drawing rules so dyed in the wool Forkers will probably groan. I'm just interested in seeing channel lines and the median line as action reaction lines. These lines are actually just a form of trendlines. I like them because they are one of the very few leading indicators that we as traders have at our disposal. Attached chart shows how I use them to provide a heads up. The lines were in place long before price reached the median line but when it did ... Bingo on the trade signals. P.S notice how price has currently stalled at the 1.2900 round number.

Me and the Pitchfork are not very well aquainted. It seems to me to be quite a futile affair to be able to set a drawing on the 30th of April that gives me a median x-over on the 4th of May (which might have only happenned (or not happened at all) several weeks later) I might have some patience, but not that much. To me the fact that it is below the MA's and crosses below the uptrending channel around 30 April/ 1 May is AMPLE signal for a short. As I am typing now, I am ignoring a trend line that signal close trade. ( I also did not close earlier at +148 pips (not through any great logic other than the fact that I was asleep when it got there, and when I awoke it was at +60) Now because of the Monster, I KNOW that the trade is safe, it might reach drawdown of over 150, I care not. If you look at the pic, The 500 and 290 are about to touch and probably cross over (Granny and Gramps are going to meet up for a quicky) and the entire 12,26,9 MacD is below em. This is going to be a groovy short. 1000 pips plus which will take approximately one month to reach. While this trade is going on, I will continue with my usual trades, I closed the first one (as you see) for various reasons. it was sharply retracing, which might have been indicative of the last attempt to get above granny and gramps (this might still happen, but when granny and gramps wanna boogy, ain't no little 'uns gonna stop em) Then I re-entered (yes at exactly the wrong time but in the bigger picture it makes no difference, this is guaranteed money. So I'll leave the pitchfork to it's dedicated followers and let em stab each other waiting 3 weeks for a three day trade to form for 50 pips. Go Guys!!! That's the way!!! BMI &lt;EDIT&gt; Actually, checking the picture, the last trend line is not quite correct, since it is a hindsight line. It is actually supposed to be running exactly through my second trades entry point, signaling a buy, but knowing that this is the first scallop drop after a trend reversal, we know it will be a short upswing. (Fine for scalping) The bigger trend is down though. &lt;/EDIT&gt;

--- 帖子 #39 ---
"So I'll leave the pitchfork to it's dedicated followers and let em stab each other waiting 3 weeks for a three day trade to form for 50 pips." No, BlueMental, that's not really how it works (IMHO). However, I do agree that your methodology does not require their use and I do not intend to distract from your wonderful thread with an off topic discussion on Forks. Suffice it to say that I use them as a purely visual aid just like trend lines except that they have the added convienience of giving a middle and top/bottom line at the same time. Just another way of visually structuring the landscape. P.S. Nice going on GBPJPY

Blue mental, thanks for share this nice system. Your heads up on G/J played nicely yesturday evening (GMT). Wanted to ask acouple: How many of these 1H setups you find per month (on all pairs)? How did you come about THESE MA numbers particularly? What are the 3 first things you look up when you first open your charts with the system? Cheers fundemental

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi fundamental. I first need to answer the second question, then the answer to the first question will make more sense. I had not learned much about mq4 at that stage, and I had read up what I could about MacD and various other indicators. Then I came accross a ZeroLag version of MacD, and I started investigating in the code as to what a MacD actually was. As I am sure you know, the help files of the Metatrader (specially for Newbies) aren't exactly the most user friendly descriptions of things. So the zero lag MacD code was the first code I came across that didn't use that amazing line:- iMACD(NULL,0,12,26,9,PRICE_CLOSE,MODE_MAIN,0) That transforms data into a MacD on your chart. Explanation of what the numbers are for in the help file? LOL not quite. So one thing led to another, and I realised that the histograph was the crossover points. At that stage I had no idea what the 9 represented, since an EMA 9 on the screen did not resemble anything on the MacD chart. So I started messing around with EMA's and SMA's and weighted Ma's, trying to see if I could find a way (thinking at the time) of drawing a histogram of the MacD on the main chart. It seemed seriously dumb to me that the zero line was not sloped at the trend angle of the two MA's that cross to form it. So in my experiments, I placed various different Ma's until I found those that closely matched the crossover points (The climb above and fall below the zeroline). Then I tried to find out what the MA9 in the MacD could match with on the main chart. From where it crossed the zero lines to where it crossed the histogram. I couldn't really find much there at all, and to be honest the 9EMA of the histogram isn't (to me at least) very useful. The actual Ma's I came up with then, I have no idea now what they actually were numerically (my memory isn't too bad, but I can't recall numbers from 4 years ago) So that was the end of that part in the evolution of the Monsters. It was basically to me it seemed at the time, sort of ok, but I just put the MacD in the usual way with an EMA(whatever number I used at the time, probably 50) on the main chart as a visual reminder of what trend the zero line is aimed at. Then (as with all of us as Newbies) one thing led to another and I tried lots and lots of lots of indicators and 'systems' and webinars and... You know the drill. Some time after that, I had become sort of ok with coding mq4, and I made a 'new' version of a MacD. Stealing parts of code from different indicators and patching them together to get it to work. Then still not really knowing what the use or purpose the Signal in the MacD's served, I wrote A MacD that puts a histogram of the difference between the MacD and the Signal. It is actually quite effective as an indicator, but I haven't used it for ages. It is attached. I used it as a crossover MacD with the Yellow histogram (as you can see in the pic) but the problem is in real time, when the Histo crosses above for only a short term, you don't know if it will stay above or if it is going to swing back down. Buy looking at the MacD histo, you can guess, but Burnt fingers is a frequent affair using crossovers without confirmations. Then I got stuck in the usual Newbie pursuit.... SCALPING. So I forgot all about that 'useless' MacD thing, because trades there took ages, and I wantted profit NOW, not in a few days and definately not weeks from now trades. There was one thing that completely did not enter my head, and I was actually totally unaware of it being part of the monster makeup, until I happened upon 'The Dance' by eclayf :- http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...04&amp;postcount=1 After reading and practicing 'The Dance' it finally dawned on me that instead of using the MA's as indicators to enter when they are crossed over, I should use them as when the Bars touch and bounce off as entries for trading as well as the crossovers. I sincerely suggest that you (and everyone) read his literature and practice The Dance, your trading will improve immensely. That was when I drew the Monsters out of the dusty cupboard they had been hiding in for years. (They weren't coded yet, they were just groups of ma's on the screen saved as templates.) LOL, While I have been typing this epic, I have missed 2 perfect entries on the M5 chart. 1st one is 80 pips, second 50 pips. &lt;split&gt;

So after messing around with the EMA's again using them together with MacD set to 75,365,60 ( I must see if I can incorporate and EMA for the original MacD's Yellow histo), I was seeking a different thing in their placing this time, yes I still wanted the crossovers to be as close as possible to the MacD (or earlier if possible) but my asttention was on the bounce off of the price actionm and searched for MA's that formed resistance and support levels. I experimented with fib based MA's and random MA's, also changing bit by bit till they showed more promise. Basically trial and error. Then it dawned on me to try the MacD numbers added together to numbers similar to those I had found most effective by trial and error. If you look at the first picture, or just load up the chart monsters (not the separate window ones) on your chart, you will see how the MA's for SR for both the Price AND the other MA's. As if they are one family supporting each other through the trials and tribulations. I hope that answered your second question. In answer to the first question, I use them on 6 charts, on a 22 inch monitor, M5, M15, H1, H4, D1, and a TickChart version of the Two Monsters. The first two pictures depict the layout, and they are zoomed out to the max. (Will explain why shortly). I can not post the entire picture in one go, since it is bigger than 1500 wide, so I have split it into two pictures. Since it is zoomed out to the Max, you can see that the purple MA (500) on the M5 chart is not exactly, but very close to FireBrick MA on H1(47) and is similar to Coral on H4. If you put a 5MA on H1, 5x60=300 so to duplicate the same MA on M15, 300/15 = 20 and on M5, 300/5 =60 and so on per each timeframe. In reverse, M5 MA has 2584 (a fib number) so 5x2584/15 = 12920. For the identical MA on M15, 12920/15=861. MA30 = 12920/30=430 etc. So what we have in effect is a scaled duplication of the Monsters from tick to Daily. Two things have just occurred to me, and I thank you for if you did not ask your questions, these realisations would have stayed hidden from me. I will check to see if using the Monsters replica's on the different time frames give any interesting results. In other words the MA periods wil change to our eyes, but in the different timeframes they will be the exact same periods. The second things is the confirmation of the first thought, since as I looked on the M5 chart, I noticed that the prices were bouncing off the 290 MA, so I placed a replica of it on the M15 (MA 105) and the H1(MA 26).The H4 already has MA5 so the calculated 6 would make almost no difference, same with Daily. A large number of the 'almost touch' and bounce points off the 290, or the ones that 'almost break through' the 47 in M15 bounce clean off 105. Super cool, more close to zero risk entry points. In essence, this means that when the FireBrick of a smaller timeframe crosses above the Indigo and Purple MA's, then the Firebrick Ma in the next timeframe up is heading towards it's Purple and Indigo Ma's. This is useful, since let us say that Firebrick is seeming like it might cross above Purple on H1, but in M5 it is moving crossing downward over the M5 purple. It is a forecast easily visible of the what is not so easy to see on the H1 chart. The M5 trends do not last as long as the H1 trends, But each smaller Timeframe gives quite clear indications for nice entry and exit points for the timeframes bigger than it. This is not so easy to explain, but if you load em up on the same currency pair and the same timeframes, and check them from all angles. (zoom in and out, and watch them in realtime data as to how they interact with each other and you will see it easily. Now once you know how they interact, you zoom them back to more normal levels, but as soon as they start x=over manoeuvers, you know what tendencies can be expected ahead. The TickMonster is an extremely cool indicator for fine tuning entry points to tiny pip levels. It is like a microscope. If for example there is a 290 crossdown in M5, and you wait for the price to strike back up to see if 290 has now become resistance, or if it is only a failed test. You look at the TickMonster, and if she crossdowns the purple thickline (I must sort out proper matching colours for TickMonster) at the same time the PA is touching the SR on the M5 chart, then you can bet your bottom dollar that the price has reversed and go short. If you think I am joking, test it. Unfortunately you can not run the TickMonster in backtesting, since it is live of the tick prices. Another thing is that you have to wait for the ticks to add up so all the MA's are present. Sadly, if you get a disconnection (even for a split second) the TickMonster clears and starts from an empty chart. One other thing, it makes zero difference to the TickMonster what the timeframe is. The zoom level is nice to play with. If you are in a scalping mood, Load up the M1, M5, M15 and the TickMonster. Using the larger timeframes for a reference fo trend etc, and the TickMonster for entry and exit. If you prefer H4 trades, load up the relevant charts. M5, M15, H1, H4, D1 and TickMonster. One other thing that amuses me quite often is how you see the exact same pattern forming in M5 chart as the pattern already present on the H1 chart, or in the TickMonster. They are fractal by nature, and we think we set them. Your final question, what is the first thing I focus on when first looking at the screen. I check to see if any of the Firbrick 47's are turning, and if so I check how they might affect the other timeframes. The next thing I check is (lets say the trend is down, and the price is below Coral (14) and firevrick(47) I look to see a touch on coral or a touch on firebrick (doesnt happen so often on down often on down). For a clearer idea about how to figure the touch and bounce off SR's, go over to The Dance, and or, study the charts in backtesting/live. Over and Out. BMI. &lt;EDIT&gt; Oh bye the way, the Aqua MA's are the replica MA's as calculated earlier, just so you can see they are the same with different MA periods. &lt;/EDIT&gt;

If you wait for the cross, you will never get a confirmation until the close of the candle. How do you determine if there is enough momentum to drive price further since you would not want to get caught in a trend change....

Hi Blue... Your explanation of two level MacD really caught my attention. If I understood your statement you said the draw back was knowing when a cross above the zero line would keep going in that direction or reverse back to the original direction. I was looking at the daily chart with your BMI indicator and was taking notice of the heights of the waves formed by the yellow MacD when the aqua MacD was going in the opposite direction. I started placing different horizontal levels on the indicator and I think I may have come up with a solid idea that would keep you out of wipsaw moves up and down around the zero line. Now granted I've only looked at this on the daily chart and have found numerous examples but by no means am I claiming this will work on all time frames and every pair. So I will use a series of charts to explain. Chart 1 GBPUSD daily - Clearly we see a down trend with both MacDs under the zero line and pointing down. Chart 2 - Price is making lower lows while the aqua MacD goes lower. We also notice the yellow MacD starts to make higher lows as price continues to make lower lows resulting in divergence. Now divergence is a nice signal that the trend is getting weaker but I wouldn't use it as my only trigger to get into a long position on a daily chart. As you can see we've been divergent for almost 2 months so if you get in long you might get stopped out really fast or would have to wait it out and hope that price turns around. I personally don't like either of those options. Chart 3 - On this chart price moves up nicely and we get a higher high and the yellow MacD moves above the zero line. Now the question is will we get a continuation move and a change in trend to the long side or will price head back down? How can we filter these moves?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Ok here is chart 4 - We see that price has made a nice up move. Now notice how far the yellow MacD has come up and over the zero line. I placed two auqa horizontal lines on the indicator, one at +200 and the other at -200. Price made a nice up move and then went straight back down again leaving us with a possible false entry to the long side. Now notice where the yellow MacD highs are during the up move and the subsequent moves in the leg labeled "Opps not yet". The yellow MacD never goes past the +200 level. Also note the aqua MacD is still well under the zero line. In real time this would give us the appearance of a strong down trend and we might expect the down trend to continue based on the aqua MacD. Chart 5 - Price has moved up after the "opps not yet leg" completed and what do we see? For the first time price has moved above the 200 level (green arrows in indicator window) and we have a higher high from the last low. Now that we are above the 200 level we wait until we get a pullback in price accompanied by a pullback in the yellow MacD. If the pulback in the yellow MacD stays above the zero line we look for some price action signals to enter long. If the pullback in the yellow MacD stays above the 200 level it is a very strong signal. Please take note that all of this is happening while the aqua MacD is still well below the zero line. If you wait until the aqua MacD confirms the up trend you would be waiting another 3 months. As you see the yellow MacD dips and stays above the 200 level and we see price action in the form of a pin bar and then a bullish outside bar for our entries. Only if we all could have gotten in on that move....sigh. I hope that makes sense and helps...

The right MAs can indicate S/R, together with pa makes them non-lagging. The beauty of BlueMental's transformation of macd is that they seem to be an approximation of true pa. just my $0.02 fun_demental

Here are some additional observations about the BMI 2 MacD set ups. What I've found is that each pair needs specific filter levels set on the MacD and each Time frame needs specific filter levels set on the MacD. So once you determine the time frame you want to trade with you will have to set the MacD filter level for that time frame. For example; AUDJPY is set to 0.25 on the 5 min chart but the daily chart may need a setting of say 2.0. I'm not sure how this will look in real time I will assume on the longer time frame charts you will be able to see the MacD bars form and get the picture of what is going on with price and will have time to react to what you are seeing. With the smaller time frames you may not be able to distinguish the MacD pattern until the move is close to being completed. It's kind of like the Stoch indicator on smaller time frames, in retrospect the stoch looks like it gives you useful information but in real time it's next to useless on smaller time frame charts like 15, 5 and 1 min. At least it is in in my opinion. Here is another example of how you might use the yellow yellow MacD and the filter level to determine a directional change on the 5 min AUDJYP chart. We see price trading in a small range on the 5 min chart (between green lines). Price breaks out to the down side. Do we take the break or wait? Note the longer term aqua MacD is above the zero line indicating an uptrend is in place. Now price breaks the - 0.25 filter level I have set on the yellow MacD indicator while aqua MacD is still above zero line. When this happens it alerts me to the fact we may have a directional change in price. Now we wait to see if we get a pullback that stays below the - 0.25 level which would confirm the directional change. If it pulls back to the zero line we still may have a change it just may not be as strong. We see a pullback (red arrows on chart) and now we look for some price action ( pin bar, engulfing bar, inside bar) for our short entry. Look at the MacD and note the green arrows at the pull back points. These pull backs do not go below the - 0.25 filter level. Also note the minor MAs in the MA window have all gone below the major MAs 290 and 500. It looks like the combination of the MacD and MAs could be a very good trading signal. I'm going to do some more investigation this week on the "live" charts to see how this works. So far on the static charts it appears to have a lot of potential. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Hi ozziedave. It makes perfect sense, but the aqua Macd is not needed at all. the Monster shows it clearly. Norice that as soon as the Small Monster (Think of them as Monther and daughter), the daughter crosses above the Firebrick, heading up towards the mother. It is just after the HL that follows the HH where Monsterdaughter confirms the reversal. Once FireBrick turns and the smaller than firebrick Ma's have crossed, You are in. I posted and uploaded the aqua Macd as my explanation of how I got to the Monster. use it if you wish, either for extra confirmation, or as an indicator, but it is not needed. In this particular setup, the High and low of the two monsters are the same, so the crossovers of the daughter with the mothers MA's are correct, but this is not always the case. Rather use only one indicator in the seperate window and set the 1st three to the Mothers settings (500,290,5) and the last 3 to the daughters settings (47,14,2) Those horizontal lines you drew at +200 and -200 are more easily and clearly seen (look at the aqua pointers on the picture) as the price action (coral and goldenrod, testing firebrick) Once they crossover, Go LONG! If you are a conservative trader, wait for bounce 2. Since we know (and can see) that the purple and indigo's are SR lines. we see that coral shoots through purple then stalls. Purple Test1 on the pic is actually the second test. But you can be 85 to 90% sure that the Price Action will channel between purple and indigo. Indigo test 1 confirms this. Conservative trader leave at 1st cross below purple. That is a safe and profitable trade. From bounce 2 till the bottom of the cross below through is 1500 pips from a 5 month trade. Yet think of this... it is very rare for the pattern to turn on 1 bounce (look at firebrick for the clear bounce formation. Frequently the bounces turn after bounce two, but 3 is generally the norm. So knowing this, it is wise to not close the trade here after 1st cross below, rather wait for the price to attemp a second test on indigo. Or if in doubt, close half your position and wait for test with the other half. From the bounce2 below on entry to test 2 on indigo, is 2200 pips. From bounce1 below, where the two red lines numbered 1 &amp; 2 confirm firebrick has turned, to 2nd test at indigo is 2400 pips. Yet the most likely outcome of this trade (had I entered it) would have been entry at bounce1 and exit just after LH(probably I would accept LH as confirmed on PA touching firebrick) after purple test 2, totalling just over 2000 pips. The next confirmed entry for a short is at test2 indigo. look at indigo numbers 1, 2 and 3. 1 is HH, 2 is HH, 3 is LH. From Test 3 number 3, till today, the pip count would be 2000 and rising. I did not enter there. But on GY I entered a few days back (I think it was on tuesday) it is posted somewhere on this thread I think. If one compares the same chart with GY, the confirmed entry point comes 2009.08 and pip count is 2400. GbpUsd is going to range for the next week or two (seemingly volatile paranoia etc.) but look at the chart! it is exactly on form to the pattern. It is the start of the third scallop. So wait until PA rises back up and bounces off coral (it might spike up to reach firebrick for 1 or 2 days, but I doubt it) And on the downrun off that bounce, jump in and go short. You will have ZERO drawdown, and catch at the very least, 1000 pips. The first scallop took 2 months, second took 3 months, third will take....? Are you seeing a partern here by any chance? Ask Mr Fib. This scallop being the third will most likely end around september, but fib 0.618 is where the trough will be, July (that is when all the economists etc, will start telling you the crisis is under control and all is happy and smiley. The trend curves up. Hopefully we reverse and not get a fourth scallop. So, hopefully this clarrifies some stuff for you. Ditch the MacD, Ditch separate window Monster, Use the Mother and Daughter on main chart Monsters. BMI

The super clear serparation in your picture of the coral and firebrick MA's after the cross below the Mother MA's is all you need. They are divorced! they are not even talking to each other (coral and firebrick. Till they start seeing eye to eye and get back into the swing of things, there aint no way they are going to elope and cross over the firebrick. I should never have uploaded the MacD. You are trying (as I did) to trade MacD in the conventional way based on crossovers only. Yes, it is a useful MacD, but it is not needed at all. If you place The Monster(both Mother and Daughter) on your main chart, and set your chart to Line chart and set the line color to NONE, You WILL trade better. The up and down runnings of the little'uns are only useful for entry and exit levels. If you focus your attention primarily on them, all you get is heart attacks (like the whole world freaked out in panic last week, while all that was happening was Granny and Gramps had a ruckus and will be parting ways for a while.) BMI

--- 帖子 #50 ---
If you feel more comfortable with the MacD, there are only 2 things you need to focus on with that indicator. 1. Aqua and Red lines. If they turn and curve upwards, the trend HAS reversed. 2. Once they have turned, the very first bounce off zero of the Yellow histo is entry point. However this is only useful for the long trades (long in relation to the timeframe they are in) The Monster (with all the bounce's off the MA's) Gives you long,medium,short AND scalping entries and exits. BMI

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hey Blue ;-) As for your charts that you would trade this method off are they as shown in your reply to ozziedave ??? Thanks Bluesteele

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi Blue.. Thanks for the feedback. Yes, I was using the aqua and yellow MacD in a more traditional way I just found it to be very visual and easy to follow. I'll study the monster overlay on my price charts a bit more. I just found the MA lines were really obscuring the candles. That's very interesting that you say you can trade without the candles by just following the monster MAs. Can't say I've ever heard of a scallop. Can you give me a quick explanation.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi again Blue, Yes, I was looking at the MacDs as more of a longer term trading system, 4hr and daily. I will definitely take a closer look at the MAs and I won't post any additional MacD charts or questions. Didn't mean to confuse anyone about your system or the value of using the Monster MAs.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Blue (you steele my blue? ) In answer to your question, Yes. Speaking and analysing in hindsight is very easy. So I will do the following. 1. Assuming the trade is not a very short term trade (I do them too) I will post the runup as I see the trade forming. I will edit the post as I enter or choose to NOT enter (when the correct confirmations do or don't occur). 2. I will state how much I percieve to be an acceptable drawdown fo that trade for me, and how I figure my risk management for the trade. 3. I will state how many pips I think I am likely to get. 4. I will state how long I expect the trade to take for completion. If you look through this thread, I stated a post I made on GY. I actually closed the trade, even though in that post I said I would leave it for far longer. The reason I closed the trade, was to lock in the profits after that drop last week. My next trade (that I will post) will in reality be a continuation of that same trade. I have been trying to find clear examples on the graphs that I can use to easily point out the Swing/Bounce patterns and how they tell you just before a reversal that a reversal has begun. It is difficult to draw them on the charts, but when I find a clear setup, I will post it. It is kind of like learning to drive. In the beginning, everything seems confusing, but after a while, you no longer need to pay conscious attention to everything. It falls into place naturally. Same with these patterns I speak of. The more of them you see, the more easy it becomes to see them. To the degree that they allow you to be more specific in your choice of which you use or do not use. I will say this in advance. I will be posting MY trades, based on my perspective, and if anyone follows and opens the same trades as I do, they risk their money out of their own decisions. I am not by any means a 'guru' and I do not say in any way that anyone should do as I say. I merely state what I would/will do in a given situation. BMI.

If you feel comfortable with MacD, then stick with it. By using MacD and Monster on the same chart, you will begin to see more easily the signals visible on the monster. (They appear usually very close to the same time) but you will also realise after a while that it is easier to see on the monster. The MacD creates problems (as shown in my initial postings) because you WILL forget to visually confirm the trend direction that the MacD displays as horizontal. And believe me, it bites! The Scallop shape... Before I go there, let me give you an interesting piece of info regarding the yellow histo on the MacD. If you open up the code, and take a look, you will see that it is merely the (MacD-SignalLine) * 12 shown as a histogram. SignalLineGold[i] = (MACDLineBuffer[i] - SignalLineBuffer[i])*12; The actual code is pasted above this line. Now set up an OsMA indicator on your chart with the following settings (37,365,30) (the 1st and last are half of the MacD's Fast MA and Signal) It gives you an almost identical copy of the yellow histo. With regard to the scallop shape. It is the sea shell shape. http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/6...lop2898795.jpg They are in every chart, every timeframe, every pair. (They are in weather charts, they are in population charts, they are EVERYWHERE. Important, they don't always trend downwards) Here are 3 small scallops (there are smaller ones forming the small ones, from tick chart into infinity) forming one ,'large' scallop. BMI

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi BlueMental, Thank you for the interesting thread. I also like MACD indicator but it's conventional style is not so informative as the way you treat it. Please keep posting. Also when posting you trades it would be helpful for newbies (like me) stop placement methodology. Or any thoughts on how we could try to fine-tune entry so the risk could be minimized (entry on some pivot breakout or using smaller timeframe...)

Here is a good possible trade growing. I am posting imediately so you can see the pictures. Then I will come back and edit in the details. &lt;EDIT&gt; Yikes!! I uploaded the pics ages ago (when I wrote the above text) then the thread was giving me half the posts on this page. (some cache issue in my browser I guess) So I rebooted and relogged in and still couldn't get to the post. While doing all this, I issed the good entry point for the short, but no stress, I wait for the M15 scallop to go up and bounce off coral, then I enter. OK, If you look at the two coloured sketches on the bottom right of the H1 chart. One is a copy of the coral MA, the other a copy ofd the Magenta MA. THOSE are tells that a reversal is imminent. The two white sketches at the top of the chart were possible ways that the trend would reverse. Notice M15 has tested and bounce The Granny and Gramps MA's. Showing both a LL and a LH. On M15, they are also just below a Round Number. If you look at D1, you will notice we are not even a quater of the way into the scallop, so in spite of the apparent upsurge, the price will realign itself to make the scallop form fluid. On H1, we are now at the start of her second scallop. (Any of you follow Elliot Wave theory? Well the third zig is usually the one that moves the most.) Yes, that is this one. I reckon somewhere around 75 to 80 hours from now, the price will reach very near 126.100 If that is the case, I get 1200 or so pips. As I am typing, the PA dropped nelow FireBrick on M15 and also FireBrick has turned. I'm in the trade. The Price may surge back for another test at purple and indigo, meaning my drawdown may reach 250 to 275 pips. A fair Risk reward ratio 275: 1200 . &lt;EDIT&gt; Sorry my calculating brain is on another planet today. 138.297 - 126.100 = 12000 pips (not the 1200 posted) &lt;/EDIT&gt; The two pics I added are the entry of the trade, and the possible outcome of the trade. &lt;/EDIT&gt;

EURUSD M15 looks like an interesting scenario.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Pretty much the same as GY. But to see the bigger picture, zoom M15 out totally, and also notice where H1, D1 are in relation to their MA's and RN. The big difference between EurUSd and GbpJpy is the volume GY moves in comparison. ( I will at some stage post a text on the inner workings of exotics and you will have a clearer understanding of how they tick) All you really need to watch though with GY, is if GbpUsd is trending down at the same time as UsdJpy trending down, GY is dropping at 1.5 to 2 times the pip movement. For some reason, FF isn't showing my posts today, I have to re-enter them to get them to show the pics. So I am attaching them again in this reply. LOL, I forgot to draw the scallop curve.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Yes, the 1.2800 round number seems to be acting as resistance at the moment. There is also a countertrend trendline that cuts up through the 1.2750 round number. If price gets there then it may seem reasonable to expect some back filling in that area. Time will tell all, as it usually does.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I have a few other useful Indicators, (One of which I did not look at before placing my GY trade.) If I had looked at it, I would have gone short on EurCad. The Eur individual strength is at 11%, while the Cad is at 88% In the last 10 hours, EurCad has dropped a steady 2012 pips after dropping below gramps and granny MA's. Aud is at 69%, while Usd has been rising steadily while I am typing from 44% up to 60% So EurAud dropped 1100pips after crossover, and EurUsd an unimpressive 600 pips after crossdown. Unfortunately EurCad is risky to enter so low in it's drop. Will watch and post what I see.

Hi Djebel. I don't use Stop Loss and Take Profit much. I might put a Stop Loss in a trade if I am in a greedy mood and it seems risky to let it run. In that case I put a SL to lock in the profit. I don't suggest you follow my example, because it took me trashing 4 accounts before I started to actually get my methods working. (I am one of those jump in the deep end types of person) Usually (unless I rush into a trade, which NO-ONE should ever do) I have a clear idea of where I feel the price is headed. So I have my own internal stoploss and tp set, which changes as the market progresses. Remember this (all traders figure this one out in the end) NO-ONE can predict the market. For example, in my earlier post, I drew a sketch of where I felt the trend was going in GY. But I didn't realise (or check) prior to my entering the trade to see how the GbpUsd and UsdJpy were looking on the charts. Since they form the price of GbpJpy, I should have looked, but did not. So now GbpUsd is dropping, while UsdJpy is climbing, which results in GbpJpy crabwalking sideways. It appears that UsdJpy will turn and drop very soon though (she is now testing to break through the Granny and Gramps MA's, but is losing the battle) Once both GbpUsd and UsdJpy drop at the same time, if they drop 1000 pips each (and their long term ranges are very similar) then GbpJpy will drop 1600 pips. As far as Stop Loss and Take Profit settings go, that is up to the individual, and 'The Dance' will give you a clear and usable setup on how to enter and what to set your stop losses for when bouncing off Support and Resistance levels (which is what we are doing here) The Dance also gives clear instructions on when to exit. It is very useful info there, not only for newbies, but for all traders. Give it a look. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...&amp;goto=lastpage BMI

Looking now at the EurUsd, it is ranging around the 1.2770 mark. It will 'break above the channel, and people will go long. Not wise to do. It is merely completing the scallop formation. It is possible to use the countertrend strike here, but go long now, while it is at it's trough. It will spike up to about halfway to firebrick, then start a slow shallow scallop. It seems to me (wrong I may well be) that EU is going to range for quite a while now. Flicking between short up trends and short down trends. But it is extremely difficult to be clear on this one. H1 shape and pattern do not confirm ranging at all. On H1 you see the scallop in an up trend. The last high bounced off purple, and PA has dropped below firebrick, but looks like it is again turning up. At this stage I would not trade eu at all since I am in a state of doubt. It is never good to trade if in doubt. Rather wait till you see something that looks clear and dive in head first. BMI

Hi BlueMental, Thanks for your astute input. I agree that EUR looks a bit uncertain at the moment. Price is around a support zone, coupled with a usually "lazy" Asian session one may do well to stand aside at present. There is certainly a distinct possibility for a bottom side test of the (47) Firebrick. As for myself, in situations like this I prefer to wait for the market to reveal it's intentions before participating. If it happens, a nice breakout of support with a pullback and continuation would suit me just fine ... no hurry, I've found more than once that Patience is one of the best trading indicators around.

BlueMental, I was looking at the property boxes on your indicators and noticed that you have a built in on/off toggle for EMA lines and a Steepmeter. Just curious what those are about? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Gosh I lied, it's actually the "not so lazy Asian session". Nice breakaway trade from under the 1.2800 and into the 1.2750 round number as well as the countertrend trendline after a lower high at the Firebrick. Whew that's a mouthful .... Just couldn't resist grabbing a couple . Remains to be seen if the underside of 1.2750 will act as a "roof".

--- 帖子 #67 ---
So far it still remains a scalp trade for me (haven't put on my swing trader's hat yet) and in that it has fullfilled it's role, Profit stop at +10. Is this one of these famous "scallops" in the making as price wants a kiss from Firebrick (47 ema)? Vascilation around the 1.2750 RN (round number) and the trendline remains to be resolved.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I guess it's resolved .. LOL. Price kisses Firebrick and I'm out for lunch money .... not unusual for the Asian session but nice enough for a few minutes work.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Another Asian session trade. A nice trendline break/ pullback/ continuation type of trade. Up above price we see the "old folks" (290, 500 ema's) parting ways. Let's see if 1.2700 is do able or if it will fizzle part ways. I'm still going to consider it a scalp at this point with profit stop now at +17 . Overall a very nice stacking of the EMA's.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Price wants to kiss where it came from - the underside of 1.2750 and the Firebrick (my line in the sand). Former support, has for the moment refused to become resistance. None the less a nice profitable scalp just riding the M5 trendfriendly waves. Last 1/3 of the position went out at +17. Did I not mention that I scale out of most of my trades (especially the scalps) on a two thirds basis leaving only the last 1/3 to be taken out by the stop. Of course, that's assuming it's a profitable trade. P.S. Although price did not tag 1.2700 on this round we do, technically have a lower low ...... interesting. O.K., I think I'm done for now. European session not opening till a few hours from now.

Blue Thanks alot for your elaborate replies earlier in the thread. Please explain regarding the scallops , Do you consider grandma and grandpa kisses as a 1 cycle scallop or also the Brick red and coral? Getting ready for G/J break of 137.00 support Keep up the excellent work! fun_demental

I'm not sure if your scalp was long or short, but either way, it makes no difference. The way I see it is this. If you can see (not guess that there is a maybe trade, I mean actually SEE) a low risk trade, wether it be a 10 pip scalp or a 150 pip swing or a 1000 pip longterm. To me it makes no sense to NOT trade them. In this picturem the PA is kissing FireBrick, and Firebick has started to turn up. When you see those in a downtrend (MA's in general are down) it is best to wait and see if the PA gets bounced below Firebrick. (Like you said patience is a great indicator) BUT!! If firebrick has NOT turned up and the PA kisses, you have a 90% certain short trade. It takes quite a while before you begin to trust jumping into a short on the touch of firebrick while the PA is shooting upwards. It is at first stressfull to say the least. It seems to contradict EVERYTHING you know. But as you do it, more and more, you begin to get the feel for when to enter on touch and when NOT to. Try it on the M15 chart with a demo account for a while. The knack starts rough, but it gets smooth pretty fast. BMI

I am still in my GY short from yesterday. She reached +240 pips earlier today and is now at -97 as I am typing. Everything still looks groovy for my trade. This one you are in looks great. Remeber to watch your PA in relation to the MA's, as well as the MA's in relation to the other MA's and also (important) Round Numbers! If you are in the trade as a short term trade, the exit when PA rises above coral. That horizontal yellow you have at the bottom as a target is based on what? Target are useful if they are based on previous SR levels, or Pivot points, or some form of defineable reasoning. (even if it is a "I will exit at +x pips"). If the target is SR based, and the price goes steady past it, then it is a great reason to stay in the trade. If it hesitates and bounces, then get out. BMI

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Both scalps were shorts in keeping with the overall EURUSD sentiment. Quote - "If firebrick has NOT turned up and the PA kisses, you have a 90% certain short trade." That's a nice observation. I am used to trading with a 50 EMA on my charts (and a couple of others as well) so Firebrick is easily my friend. Angle or slope on any MA is usually a pretty good way to judge sentiment particularly when the MA's all line up or "stack" themselves. Makes "seeing" the trades pretty straight forward. The more that I am watching your combination of EMA's on the charts the more I am getting to like them primarily because they describe PA so well. Nice job!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
You are 100% right to trade with the trends direction. Too often (My greed gland in overdrive) I go for the counter trend scalps, and 85% of them turn sour! Ho-Hum, if only patience would accept the bribe I offerred him to slap the greed gland every time he starts getting overactive! BMI.

Grandma and grandpa are SR levels, so too are many other things. The monster with the 6 MA's just happen to be often repeating SR levels. The scallops and bounces start and end touching an SR level of one kind or another, wether it be Round Numbers, The Monsters MA's, Previous Low/High points, whatever, it is not really relevant where they start and end. What is relevant is noticing the current scallop or bounce you are in, and watch its shape. If it is keeping to the shape it does 90% of the time, and the shape appears to be close to it's end, or in the case of a bounce, near it's peak (it is leveling out and appears to be short term ranging), then if it hits a recognisable SR level at that time, you have a good indication of where it is most likely to go next. The third line on this pic (below the scallop that became a bounce) points out the bounce is being resisted by the coral MA. It is trying to reverse and go above grandma &amp; grandpa. However it fails, and the pattern again becomes a scallop. I would have entered this trade where my second line (1st being on left side) shows the PA (and scallop) touching firebrick(Mother) and Maroon(Grandma). Again after that the pattern changes to bounce. (a clear indication of reversal or at the very least retracement. This attempt fails worse than the previous attempt. The PA can't hold above coral, let alone try to break above firebrick. Notice the widening gap between firebrick and maroon (grandma). Notice also that the firebrick(Mother) stays above coral(Daughter) from the earlier crossover above grandma. One other thing that raises a thought regarding how long the trend would go on for is that grandma and grandpa are edging towards eaxh other, NOT away. That together with the constant changing from scallop to bounce makes it seem the trend will not be very long. It has a ring of uncertainty to it. Meaning it is cool for a short, but needs watching. The exit would be to wait until 1st test to cross firebrick (where a few bars stay above firebrick) and wait for the HL that developes after that, then exit. OR if the PA (bars) rise above coral and a coral becomes resistance that refuses to let them drop again below. You understand that we can not know where the cycle starts and ends. We can because of the visibility through the MA's see several start and end points in real time. This allows us the ability to jump into a trade where the normal procedure would be to wait for confirmation (which you did) that puts you in the trade 30 bars later. The fear of losing is big in all of us, but as you do this more and more, you find it much easier. Clay (the author of The Dance) uses a SL of 12 pips on entering a touch SL trade. That is ok for GbpUsd, but with GbpJpy it is too small. It will most likely kill your trade before it can start. If you feel the need to use SL, then on touch (all the white lines places), a SL of 20 would secure most of them to become trades. Realise also that to lose 20 pips is not a biggie. You have the likelyhood (specially with GbpJpy) of gaining at least 5 times more than 20 (100 pips) on the M15 chart. BMI

I find that the immediate interaction of PA with the 14 EMA and the intermediate interaction of PA with the 47 EMA are of crucial importance. Subsequently the zone between the 47 EMA and the 14 EMA is an area that I particularly like to keep an eye on. As price nears or moves into the zone I will take a "heads up" attitude. Price moving away from or out of the zone often signals a trade. In order to add a little visual treat to the charts, I have adapted a ribbon indicator that I use with my "other MA" chart set up for use with this methodology. I place it on the chart before putting the sm MACD in place over top of it. In the properties box I set the EMA's to 14 and 47. I also set the style to dots so that I can still see the candle wicks. The colours can be set to your own preference. Enjoy.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
The same indicator can be used to colour up the 2 EMA and 14 EMA zone and/or the 5 EMA - 14 EMA zone as well. Colour to your hearts content. Wow! Better than hi definition television . Now all we need are some 3D glasses and we are set to go - look out Hollywood!

As a swing trader, I am always interested in differentiating Impulse waves from Corrective waves. Market structure is a wave within wave kind of structure. There are Greater degree Impulse waves that have Lesser degree Impulse and Lesser degree Corrective waves within them. The same is true for Greater degree Corrective waves. Think, pullbacks within trends or BlueMental's "scallops". Since the combination of EMA's used with this methodology does a very bang up job of delineating market wave structure, we should be able to use that knowledge to delineate the Impulse and Corrective waves. As a swing trader, I for one, would find that very useful. Well, there is a way and it is very simple. The Firebrick (47 ema) is the most useful of our wave delineaters. What we are attempting to do is to use it to create an Alert (no - not a trade signal) to "alert us " to a change in wave direction. Along with Firebrick we have a beautifull 2 EMA at our disposal to use as an alert trigger. Attached is a basic EMA Crossover indie that I have adapted as a bolt on for our charts. For the fun of it, I call it the Golden Budhha. The Mantra that goes with it is: "Give me the wisdom not to trade against the Golden Buddha" Might even help BlueMental with those countertrend trades that he likes so much . LOL. Remember, this is an alert and not an automatic trade signal. I use it for those times when I just don't want anymore "eyeballs on glass" but don't want to miss one of those sought after Impules waves as it will call pretty much every wave. The attached chart is self explanitory. So, no more excuses for missing one of those beauties, eh!

Sorry, forgot to add the indie to the above post.

Good heavens! here I am quoting myself, what is the world coming to! Just wanted to post a textbook example of what I meant in the above quote. This one happened in the EURUSD today and did everyting it was supposed to . "If firebrick has NOT turned up and the PA kisses, you have a 90% certain short trade." Remember BlueMental's quote? Well PA didn't kiss on this occasion but the part about the Firebrick slope fits perfectly. O.K. That's it for me for today. Have a good one everbody.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Both cool indicators. The mind sometimes wanders, and a visual and/or audio alert is great. With The Golden Buddha, in your pic, any of the down arrows are tradable (since they agree with the general trend.) Ummm, please tell me if I did or did not post the BMI Engine in this thread. I did post it somewhere, and it is (for me anyway) far more useful than having to physically enter trades and lots etc for each trade. I recall that it has a bit of a hangup with some Mt4's, but those things are easily fixable. Thanks for the indie's. BMI.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
PA DID kiss, only it didn't kiss firebrick, it tested (and failed to break through) coral, and PA therefoe kissed coral. Remember, the bounces and scallops. The reason they are so useful is the following. If the PA is trending down and is in the scallop pattern, then the kisses of the MA's above are brief single bar kisses with sharp climbs fillowed by sharp drops. Yet if the PA is down trending in the bounce pattern, the kisses are on the apex of the curve, (as it is in your picture.) It is far easier to get the timing right with the bounce pattern, but the scallop pattern offers fast profitable trades. More important to realise is that with The Monster, ALL the kisses on ALL the MA's (from coral upwards) are tradable. Look at the kiss of the Grand MA (beginning of your pic) BMI

Ahhh yes, kissing is a matter of degree .... a kiss on the cheek, on the lips, a juicey wet one, French Kiss

The thing to keep in mind, is that through observing the repeating cycles and patterns on the charts, we are aware (in hindsight) of the downtrend or uptrends beginning. By looking with the right eye, we are also aware that The Affair (as can be seen on the charts too) is started with a Kiss. BMI.

Fun De Mental. With the indie's supplied by FxHermit, here is a simpler and clearer way of seeing the patterns instead of getting stuck on the minor details. When driving a car, instead of focusing your attention on the dead bug on the glass, look through it and follow the path of the road. http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/2...yh4ribbons.png &lt;EDIT&gt; Oops, wrong pair &lt;/EDIT&gt; http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/214...yh4ribbons.png Perhaps this (H4 GbpJpy) picture will allow you to see why I did NOT close my GY trade even though it was at +140 pips earlier. BMI.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
BlueMental, I like your colouring. A beautiful visual representation of market wave structure as created by PA. The EMA's collectively do a superb job of differentiating the Corrective waves and the preferably sought after Impulse waves at various levels. Very revealing view of "The Power of the Magic Monster". LOL, we're gonna get a Hollywood movie out of this yet. That GBPUSD chart is spectacular! That period from December throught to April - what an absolute fortune making landscape. H4 is a great timeframe for that sort of thing and I think we have here, at our disposal, a great set of tools and the charisma to kiss and dance with her. What happens after that would require an Adult movie rating.

OK, the trade is still open and as you can see buy the white curve patterns in the image below, (they are offset so you can compare them with the chart data), the two bounces have now changed into the first scallop. This is the tell I was speaking about, We are likely to see at the least two scallops, but I expect at least 3. GbpJpy has been in a range pattern (will post a separate post on that after this) and I only became aware of it after entering the short position. The straight white line shows the clear and distinct change point between bounce and swing. This further indicates a trend change. (As I stated in my attempt to explain the way the PA tells us before it reverses) http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/1815/...pyh1ribbon.png As you can see, the PA has tested GrandPa, but has failed 3 times in succession. Notice that the last High is a Lower High. It is still possible that PA will break above GrandPa, but to me it seems unlikely, since if viewed on the H4 chart, it is in the beginning section of a medium term scallop. http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/4...pyh4ribbon.png In this picture below, just for a bit of clarrification, you can see where the trade has been so far.(The scalps are not indicated here). Sorry the pic is a bit cut off and out of date, the text by the green line states "Did Not Close +240" and the drawdown reached -150 pips in the high after the one indicated. http://img682.imageshack.us/img682/8...13gbpjpyh1.png Finally, in this last picture, I show you the small trades I have opened and closed to augment the initial Sell position. They are all countertrades to the Sell, and are Hedge Scalping. (This account is FXCM London, so hedging is allowed.) http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/7...10512to200.png Do the math, these trades are +63.6 Pips, which I built slowly as an offset in case PA breaks above GrandPa. If I chose to close the Sell now, it is currently at +90 pips, meaning the total would be +150 pips. This has not so far been a 'perfect' trade, but I still see it as being a 1000 or more Short. Time will tell. If you observe the D1 chart, it shows a possible long term reversal. If this is the case, it is likely that the PA will reach the last low or near to it (122.880). It might drop further, one can only guess. Yet for arguments sake, lets say I am 100% wrong, and it reaches halfway to the last low at 129.838. That would make the Short (opened at 138.297) reach 845 Pips (138.297-129.838 = 8.459 where 0.059 = 5.9 pips) BMI

With the colorful indie's supplied by FxHermit coupled with zooming out the charts one can indeed get the 'bigger picture' at a glance and the status of the flow of price. The way I see it is I want to play the bounces off of support/resistance levels that BMI so cleverly identifies on MULTI TIME FRAMES. It takes some practice but the more you see it the confident you'd get with possible entries and exits. Thanks, fun_demental

First you need to download the Zip file attached so what I am showing in picture and text form makes sense. Read the PDF, then load the xcel file, THEN look at the pictures on this post. The following picture is the D1 chart of GbpUsd. The likely pattern for the PA to follow is shown with the White curves. http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/835...0513ribbon.png This Picture is the 'forecast' of the D1 UsdJpy. The likely PA path is the White curve, while it is possible (not a great % chance) of the black curves being UsdJpy's pathway. http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5...0513ribbon.png These depicted paths are as you must surely realise at best, 'educated guesses'. We can not ever really predict the market (or anything else for that matter) but we can see the probable paths that are already in motion and where they most likely will tend towards. Assuming that both the white curves on these two charts portray the two pairs, we end up with the following pictures calculations. http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/492/gbpjpyforecast.png If however (like winning the lotto) by a stroke of good fortune, the UsdJpy were to follow the Black curves pathway, we end up with this pictures calculations. http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/816...tblackpath.png It is a win/win situation. If things go the way of thw white pathway on both GbpUsd and UsdJpy, then the Sell gets about +550 pips. If it goes the black pathway on UsdJpy while GbpUsd goes on the white pathway, then the Sell gets +2288 pips. Regardless, I am happy with the trades possibilities. As stated in the post prior to this one, I am still keeping my eye open for low risk hedges that can be used as a security in case ALL my forecasting is wrong. While if the forecasting is right, the hedging is merely adding more pips to the overall trade. BMI.

The strange thing is this. I decided to put a bit of what I have discovered over the past few years because of "The Dance". By reading that thread, it finally clicked things into place that have been missing all along in my trading toolbox. The 2 separate things are. 1. MA's are dynamic SR levels if you find the right ones that offer brilliant entry points when bounced off. I was fully aware that the MA's were SR levels, but my viewpoint on them was in a downward trending scenario, if PA touched or crossed above the MA's, it is time to exit. (How backwards my viewpoint actually was!!) 2. Round Numbers!!! are SR levels. I had never, ever thought of number in my trading philosophy. As you have no doubt discovered, I prefer to view the fractal pattern structure and see the dynamic interaction of shapes in the data, rather than looking at the actual numbers themselves. Once eclayf brought that to my attention it seemed so obvious I was actually surprised I had not realised it AGES ago! Thinking back, one always hears the 'importance' of numbers. Like the $300, then $400, milestone's of the Gold price.(latest one was $1200). Same with the Oil prices. I was so dumb not to notice the round number conundrum that has in the past (I now realise) destroyed many a trade of mine. Whether it was by turning for some reason I could not see (hitting and bouncing off a Round Number) or ranging for some reason that appeared unharmonious (to me) and not in flow with the data flow patterns. (Refusing to break beyond a round number). The Mob lynching of eclayf together with a book called Battle Royale as well as the Round Number realisation has just clicked one other vital piece of information into place in my toolbox. In the story Battle Royale, young students are placed in a 'game' by their government. They get collars placed on their necks that contain explosives, and if they break any of the 'game' rules, the controllers of the game detonate the rule breakers bomb. The rules of the 'game' are simple. The winner is the last one standing, and if no one dies within a given time period, then all the colars will be detonated. You will soon see why I bring this 'non forex topic' up. In the story, one young girl had seen the end part of fight early on in the 'game' where one of the main characters, Shuya was removing an axe from another guys cracked open skull. That girl had not seen the leadup of the fight and did not realise that Shuya actually tried to convince the other guy to NOT fight and to find a way to escape, and that the instigators of the 'game', their government were the true enemy. He was forced to fight in self defence. The girls perspective (as you can imagine from what she saw) was that he was a brutal monster that murdered the other guy. Much later in the story, because of her perspectives, Shuya (who was badly wounded) had finally managed to convince the leader of a group of 6 girls that he had found a way to escape the 'game'. Yet that girl that had embedded in her mind the original perspective, placed some poison in the food that was going to be given to Shuya. She wished to kill 'the monster'. She was convinced he was manipulating the group and would kill them all once he got his strength back. One of the other girls walked in from outside the room and before she could be stopped, took a bite of the poisoned food. You can imagine the scene, those that once trusted each other suddenly find that one of their own had killed a member of their group. Mayhem breaks out and a killing spree of mistrust and fear occurs. Round Numbers are no different. The people's belief was unbreakable, Never in a million years will anyone break the four minute mile. Never will the 100m sprint be done under 10 seconds. There are lots of these 'round numbers' so to speak. I bring this to your attention FxHermit, since you are the only person that is actually reading this thread and seeing what I have posted. The rest are seeing 'another Keith' or a scam. Their perspective has become biased due to the public lynching of eclayf. BMI

BMI, I read and follow your posts and system, quietly trying to assimilate what you have so freely given. It is appreciated, please keep on posting. As you can see from my posting count, I prefer to sit in the back of the class and take in the gems of wisdom that are presented here. As suggested here, I re-visited "The Dance" thread ( the first time having pass on it as the system was more estoric and fluid and I was looking more for a mechanical sytem). This time, reading it together with your system, it started to making sense. The two systems are like fraternal twins (alike but different). It's unfortunate that such events happen of a regular basis here on FF. I seen the "MP ???? 500 pips and all the ice-cream you can eat, C4/Nitro, and now The Dance thread closed down. The accusation in all cases was that the thread starter scammed some poeple of their money. Not being a party to complaint, it becomes a he said - she said type of argument to me. Neither side have presented their case beyond a reasonable doubt (which is a fairly high standard I might say). The truth is probably somewhere in the middle as they say . The common thread in all these cases is GREED and LAZINESS . People willingly handed over money to someone they did not know and in all probability they haven't even meet. They are too lazy to test the system (or claims) to see if they are legitimate. Their greed takeover and see nothing but $$$'s. They forget one unalienable fact, Reward &amp; Risk, The bigger the reward the higher the risk. When it all blows up in their face, they cry foul. I know, no one deserves to be scammed, but at least look at yourself in the mirror and take responsibilty for your actions. It's not ok to say I'll publicy apologise after the thread is closed if I am wrong. You did not do your due diligence the first time and you are not doing your due diligence this time. Enough of my rant. BMI, keep presenting your ideas. There lots of kids in the back of the class here watching and trying to take it all in. fxtrader2k7

Ok guys/gals. I will continue to post, but here is something important to consider. There is no 'system' or 'formula' that will make a trader profitable. The forex market is intricately linked, and when a corporate transaction takes place, it affects all the pairs that share the currencies involved. The governments of each country have their own countries requirements and needs of what level is suitable for their currencies value is at. For example, The Japanese government and trade industry prefer the value of the yen to be kept as low as possible, since their primary income is exporting. It suits them to have a low valued currency since it ensures a greater demand for their export trade. So we (or anyone else for that matter) can not ever predict the market at all. So a 'system' can not have the magic formula that takes all the millions of things into account that affect the forex trade. So we as traders need to find a way of dealing with the total unpredictability of the market. We can only follow what we see is happening in the market place, for if we try to predict what will happen next, we are merely gambling on a 3 legged horse in a race of 20 million horses. Because of human nature, and also because of limits of resources, we have one thing that we can see and learn to recognise. That is the pattern that presents itself in the market changes. When 1 person panics and sells everything he has, it is a tiny dot on a graph. When 20 do the same it is 1 tick on the tick graph. When a few million do it, it is a spike on a graph. When a few million do it a second time, it is a virus that infects a few million more and the spike becomes a trend. Recognising these things on a graph, listening to the news, weighing the sentiment regarding a currency are all signs that can assist us as traders. For example, the Greece situation. If you are aware that a country (like Greece) is in a hot spot financially, you also know that the Euro is more likely to fall in value than rise. Public sentiment (demand) is not very high at that time for Euro. So when looking at the Euro charts, you focus on short trades as opposed to long trades. All of these various 'hidden' indicators only become visible to the trader if he/she is aware of their existence. So a 'system' like the Monster is not in itself actually worth a single thing if you are not aware of the background details related to any pair you have your chart set on. A climbing trend on the H1 chart has only short term value if the Weekly trend of that same currency is in a downtrend. So in reality, for the purpose of trading profitably, one needs to keep ones finger on the pulse. By looking at the charts, one can see repeating patterns that occur regardless of the external influence of the market. In the big picture, those 'small' patterns are of no importance at all. Yet they are crucial to trading profitably on in the short term. The market data is dynamic, and these recognisable patterns change, but if your finger is on the pulse, they are usable for profitable trade. For example, go take a look at this thread:- http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...70&amp;postcount=1 geoffb65 has recognised a pattern that has been in place for just over a year regarding GbpUsd. (A year in the big picture is a tiny timeframe) While that pattern persists, USE it. Do not get stuck on the 'system'. Rather observe the pattern that the system is using, so you are best able to see that when the pattern begins to alter, you can either adapt to the new pattern, or scrap it completely until a new recognisable pattern is formed. I trade only GbpJpy. I observe it. I study it. I recognise it and it's tendancies more than any other pair. It is very similar in many respects to a lot of other pairs. (The clone pairs and the mirror pairs) Yet it has it's own unique idiosyncrasies. It has periods in the day where it usually ranges in a horrizontal channel from which it breaks out. It has certain times of day where trade volatility is good for scalping. It has recognisable tendancies that might be similar to other pairs or might not. By focusing on only one pair and trying to feel the pulse on that pair, allows a more selective and 'educated' viewpoint of profitable trade. Now once you develop the 'big picture' view of a pair, then indicators like Monster or The Dance or SonicR ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=114792 ) have a far more consistant profitability ratio. I went to a Technical School as a kid. I enjoyed making, designing and inventing things, so I chose a trade as my vehicle. I chose fitting and turning as my school trade. For the first 2 years, we were taught lots of theory, and on the practical side, we got the use of hand tools only. Files and a hacksaw was about it. We were only allowed to use the Drilling machine from the machinery section. Some of the people in my class never got efficient at filing even after two years of it. In the third year, we moved on to machines. Those that did not master the filing and sawing parts of the first two years, failed miserably with the machines. One guy on his very first day on a lathe machine, got his overall snagged in the lathe because he had not zipped his overall closed. He managed (by luck) to not get severly injured, and the next day he changed trades and moved to electronics. The point I am making here is that one needs to become totally familiar with the small details of a thing to be able to use that thing, rather than be used BY that thing. If you have chosen to trade forex as a career, you can not expect to know it well enough to succeed in a year or two. There might be (as in all things there are) 'the naturals' that simply start and shoot to the top. Even if you ARE a 'natural' it is still better to do the 'dirty' work. Grab that file and slog away at that chunk of metal till your muscles ache. Learn how to continue filing without allowing the blisters to develop into bleeding sores. Allow your hands the time to develop calluses to prevent new sores/blisters. Let the tendons stretch and settle in to the work at hand. Even now, so many years later, I can still comfortably make something out of metal with nothing more than a file and a hacksaw and some measuring tools, that equals a machined piece in accuracy, without getting tired and without a single blister. Forex is no different. I am now in my third year of trading forex, and only NOW am I finally beginning to be profitable more often than losing. As I trade more efficiently, my trades are becoming longer term and far more simple. I have a good idea how far the drawbacks will be and how far a reasonable profit should reach. I have learned how some bad trades are repairable to a certain degree with hedging, while others should be closed imediately or suffer another trashed account. Without having the blisters, all one can have is the conceptual version of things. The conceptual version and the real version are never the same, and knowledge can only be earned through the mistakes/blisters/sweat equity. BMI

Blue M.....have been also following the thread, probably from the 1st day! Appreciate all you are doing.....wanted to ask....What timeframe are you PRIMARILY using in entering the trades, I believe you mentioned earlier that you prefer the 4 hour....also, really like the Visuals of your charts...would it be possible to post your template? As you can see, you do have people following your thread, our silence may be somewhat deafening, but we are learning to see things from a different perspective with the MACD curving rather than in a straight line

Hi 4xplosion Ummm that is not an easy question to answer. I have on my mt4 (since I 99% of the time trade only GbpJpy) only one pair. I have 6 charts. M15 Top left, H1, top centre, H4 top right, M30(which I swap to D1 when need be) bottom left, Tickchart(with The Dance MA's on it in a close up view) bottom centre, and TickMonster(which I attached, but need to reattach since I sorted the correct colour scheme for it as an exact copy of the main chart Monster) I watch all the charts for a general view of good entry points. If H4 and or H1 are in the last (flat) part of a scallop, and M15 is touching an MA on a down trend (Firebrick or Purple or Indigo {mother, Grandma or GrandPa}) I do NOT enter a short. Because it is likely to be a low pip short, which is not what I am after. If however all the slower timeframes are in good entry places on the scallop pattern, then I watch M15 till it head up towards an SR (either GrandPa, GrandMa, or Mother). When it is near to touching, I focus my full attention on the TickMonster. When the tick prices break below both the Grandparents, and the Mother also breaks below her parents, I wait for coral (in the TickMonster) to bounce below the GrandParents. (The mother needs to also have remained below her parents). Then I enter the short. For Long positions it obviously all goes the other way around. So which timeframe do I Primarily use...? Ummmm ALL of them! With regards to a template, I will upload a profile. But I need to know your screen resolution. (mine is 1680x1050) BMI

I am attaching the same pic as yours, with bubbles added. http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/1...5eurusdm30.png Now at these bubbles, the first(from left) one shows a down arrow and since Mother was trending up, I doubt I would have entered a short there (the arrow would only appear once PA was bellow all the MA's. But it is best to wait for the end of the first scallop. ( If you caught the falling knife, your entry could easily be by the ranging section, which is not good.) But having viewed the repeated pattern, and also through your own trading experience, you KNOW there will be a retrace. So by waiting for the 'almost' touch 7 bars after the arrow, and by watching the TickMonster, you would be able to get a short in very near (including spread) the close position of the 6th bar. Your drawdown would be so tiny that it is almost Eutopia. When the Golden Buddha (in this case I got it set as arrows) shows the UP arrow, you use that as your signal to start watching the TickMonster for the short retracement uptrend to swing back down. It isn't a kiss of Mother, But how it shows on the TickMonster is exactly the same as the pattern is of the First Arrow on the main chart. All the Ma's fall into place below the Grandparents and the Mother tries to continue upwards but her parents resist and send her downwards. This is where you add your SECOND short. On the third Bubble, I would not have entered a third short, because the scallop is shallow and mostly ranging. I would have watched to see if the PA breaks above. (Sometimes, not often, but sometimes PA breaks through on first touch.) Once PA breaks below Mother I would have entered a short on COB of the third down Bar. (3 bar breakout). I would have not expected the upsurge to touch coral (daughter) but I would only consider closing my trades if I saw a long wick pin form into a morning star, or an engulfing Bar (If it had closed above the previous (almost pin) bar) Fourth Bubble. I am not sure if I would add another short here. Probably not. It is the third swing/scallop of the downtrend, and a fourth short would be pushing my luck. I would probably be expecting the drop to be a Higher Low. I would be watching at this stage for signs to exit the trade. PA is FAR from Grandparents, and 4th Bubble is third touch of Mother. The BIG scallop (mother formed) is about due for her retrace. Even though both 4th and 5th bubble gave double top Bars, I would just let it run till I see reversal signs.(Mother retrace signs) If all the MA's climb above Mother, and Mother starts to level out, I would look at the H4 and D1 charts to see how I feel about long terming the trade. If the signs are super clear that this is just a Mother retrace and we can expect another scallop, I would then wait for Mother to turn, and when I get the first kiss (the PA testing to go below her new resistance) I would then place a Long position of equal lots to my 3 short positions. (That is if the D1 and H4 got me to decide to stay long term short) If the D1 &amp; H4 charts showed Mother reversal as opposed to second/third scallop, I would close my 3 shorts and open a Long position with the same percentage ratio I used as my first short opened. (In other words not a HUGE lots Long position) The short trade would be history, and the new long trade stands on it's own merits or not at all. It is not related to the past. BMI.

OK first Pic is EurUsd Daily http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/297...15eurusdd1.png As you can see, on the Daly chart, we have a Lower High, and the last two days of last week have brought EurUsd to her Lower Low. The shallowness of the previous uptrend (March 2009 to Dec 2009) shows us there is was not much momentum in the uptrend. The uptrend before that was 3 months short of two years. As opposed to 6 months of the last one. Not only is she below the low of the last uptrend, she is also below the low of the first uptrend on the chart. The scallop (mother) that she is now in is more or less at its ranging stage, But I think it is going to still drop a bit further (will explain on second pics text) before a sharp spike like retrace. I also feel that the retrace will not break above Grandma, and the second scallop will starts there. Timewise, I would venture a guess of the retrace ending approximately 100 days from now and will reach around the 1.3250 level. I also think it will be volatile up and down swings. (From euphoria of having 'overcome' the 'catastrophe' to sheer panic and drop for whatever the news of the day will be that precedes it. (while actually the reason it is dropping is grandma slapping daughter back down). Second Pic is EurUsd Weekly http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/210...15eurusdw1.png The verticle line is the same time as the one in the Daily pic. I think that the upsurge will happen when the price hits the dual SR of the Round Number 1.1800, which is also the low area of November 2005. The institutions, banks and governments will probably pump money into the market place (as was done with the Fanny Mae situation). Then the 'we are saved' buying frenzy, which is the scallops retrace will bring the price up to test Mother (Mother on the Weekly chart is Grandma on the Daily chart). We are just prior to the start of the first downtrend scallop. We might see the PA test grandma and grandpa ans fail to break below, then bounce up a bit then retest and break below. To me however I think it will break below. If the downtrend scallop is confirmed Weekly chart shows time frame of between 20 to 40 weeks = 140 days to 280 days) for the Mother scallop to end her retrace and the start of the second scallop begins. It appears to me (Weekly pattern is heading on a downtrend to reach Higher Low) that the downtrend will bring EurUsd to somewhere in the region of 0.9000 to 1.0000 over a period of 600 to 700 weeks. (10 to 12 years) The lifespan of Grandma and Grandpa's scallop (which is in the proccess of forming.) 4000 pips more or less. (plus all the swings on the intraday trades etc. makes it a useful downtrend to forex traders.) Me, I still stick with GbpJpy. The pip movement over the same 10 years will be in the region of 8 to 10 thousand pips. BMI

Hi Is any one trading this in a daily chart also could someone please post a template and the indicaters I am very interested as this seems very effective

--- 帖子 #111 ---
As you will see in the opicture below, GbpJpy is what (if viewed incorrectly) A bad trading position. Bad in the sense of on M15, it looks like a certainty that PA will climb. TickMonster agree's with the climb sentiment. So too does TickAveragesDance. But M5 (and H4 which is not in the picture) both show an SR in the form of an MA. The PA could bounce off Grandma (on M5) and or off EMA 8 in H4. Alternatively, the PA could break through Grandma on M5. The right way to view this is to see if PA and goldenrod and firebrick all break above grandma. If they do and bounce further up. On M5, the next potential resistance is grandpa (which is more or less equal to the MA8 level on H4. There is about 50 pips of pspace between Grandma and grandpa. By my specs (for the type of trade I am looking for, that is not enough) However, grandma resists PA, then it means a new scallop has begun. (confirmed when PA and goldenrod drop below firebrick. A short (assuming it develops and confirms should yield at least 200 to 250 pips. Watch the flow and feel how TickMonster is super useful for entries and confirming bounces. http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/307...jpyexample.png BMI

Hey Blue... Don;t mean to sound DAH...but how do you get the indicators to show up on your chart like you have em. When I load them I get an indicator window at the bottom of my chart?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi ozziedave. It depends which indicators you are talking about. The TickDancer and TheMonster are Tick Data only, so they only put data on the charts when PA takes place. There is no saved Tickdata that is accessable for indicators, so they start out empty. When you are logged in to your account (demo or live), only when the Bid price changes, does it show up on the Tick indicators. If you are not sure which indicators you have downloaded, if you go to the very top of the Forexfactory Forum page, you will see on the top right a number (currently 51) with a paperclip on it's right hand side. If you click on that number or the paperclip, your browser will open a separate window that shows you all the attached files (mq4, zip, png etc.) that are uploaded into this thread by me and anyone else who uploaded anything to post (pictures or indicators like the EMA Crossover Signal uploaded by fxhermit) To download those files, in the separate browser window, you simply click on the file name in the first column. If you wish to see the post they were attached to, click 'post' (also in the first column, and the browser will open on that page in Forex factory. You will have to scroll up and down the page until you find the same data (that is shown in column two on the separate browser window). TickData_Averaged6.mq4 is obsolete because it is replaced by later atachments (TickMonster and Tickdancer) as it's settings were different colours and it was confusing compared to the EMA_6-bands_Sm_MacD.mq4 indicators. The UpDownChartWin.mq4 indicator and the UpDownSepWin.mq4 indicators show the same thing, which is (look at my latest pictures in previous posts) three horizontal blue lines with three numbers. the Top lines number is how many pips above Bid the line is. The Bid line number (always zero) is 0 pips away from bid, and the bottom lines's number is the same as the top lines number but negative. This is just an easy visual check for you to see how much pip change there is on a given chart. If you want to have that indicator on your Tickdata charts, you need to use the UpDownSepWin.mq4 because the Tickdance and the TickMonster are not on the main chart window. If you use the UpDownChartwin.mq4 on a chart that has no separate windows (specifically the Tickchart indicators) it will just give you a blank second window with three llines and HUGE numbers that don't change. If you drag and place the UpDownSepWin.mq4 onto an existing indicator (like Stochastics or qqe) it will be there but do and show nothing. It is made for use together with the TickMonster and the Tickdancer mq4's. If you load up the EMA-6bands... mq4 indicators, they place the MA's in one of two places. If you use the Separate window versions, it puts them in their own window, while the chart version puts them (all the EMA's) on the main chart window. If this does not assist you, then be specific about which chart you are not getting to work and I can help you further. One other thing, On the Tick Indicators. If you change the timeframe, or change a setting in the properties of either the Tickdancer, or the TickMonster indicators, you restart the indicator from a blank screen base. (It doesn't save the data so it has to re-initialise and start from zero) I set my Tickindicators to the weekly timeframe for one simple reason. I can log off from my account, and relog on later and the chart will continue to update (although the first 500 ticks the grandpa and grandma MA's won't be correct). If the connection fails and a new bar happens while you are disconnected, you end up with the Tick indicators trying to add in an EMPTY_VALUE (which is 275045456 or similar to that number) which messes it all up. So to reset it, you simply change the timeframe, or load up the indicators properties, open the edit option and reclose it. After that you will have a blank Tick indicator ready to start from zero.

Int the picture GbpJpy H4, you can see that the pattern formation is a downtrending Bounce Pattern. http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/9...yh4bounced.png So by being aware of this, we have an edge that those who are NOT aware of the bounce/swing pattern structure do not have. We know that the Price Action is most likely to follow the form of the third white curve. We are also aware that if it does and reaches what appears to the rest of the Forex traders that are unaware of the Bounce pattern, to be what people often call a ranging state showing indecision in the market place. This is very far from the truth. It is actually just a curve being a curve. We therefore know two things we can deduce from this knowledge. 1. If the PA reaches the top and is still within the bounce curve boundaries, then the likelyhood of the aparent 'breakout' of the ranging channel it will be in is 95% chance or more that it will break below. 2. If the PA starts to show intent to deviate from the third white curve, Then the pattern is in the proccess of changing into a scallop (or swing) pattern. Meaning the PA is reversing. If the pattern does become a swing pattern, it is preceded by a 'spike' which could go up or down. It would generally be a large pip movement spike, and after it reaches it's end; if it shoots up and stalls or if it drops drastically, it will rapidly retrace and if entered at the correct time, gets a very quick high profit trade. Usually the pattern change spikes are in the opposite direction to the current patterns trend. The beginning of the second white bounce curve was a drastic down drop. Since it was in the same direction as the current trend, it did not change from bounce to swing. But you can clearly see that in one H4 bar, it retraced over 600 pips. If you got a long trade somewhere near the bottom of that drop (which I did not unfortunately) you were smiling all the way to the bank. If you look closer at the same time period, on the M30 chart, that the actuall time it took for the retrace was less than 1 hour. One (using the M5 and M15 and TickMonster charts for confirmation) could feasibly have captured perhaps 350 pips of that 600 pip retrace. Not bad for just over 1 hours work.

Hi, BlueMental, Thanks for the explanation the other day. Please keep posting, it's interesting reading. I also have been watching and forward testing this method (on demo) for a 2 days, but the total result is minus so far. I traded on EURJPY (GBPJPY has too wide spread). What I've found is that in real trading condition I need bigger stop: I was thinking of 5 pips+spread, but it's nothing on this pair. Need at least 10+spread. So the risk for trade is already 15 (+ a few pips of slippage). To make this method work the profit should be at least 60 pips... I am studying this method on different types of charts (bar, renko, etc.) and timeframes. After the fact it is always easy to see patterns with this method, but in realtime... Still trying to figure out how can I increase the probability of successful trade. Say trading in the direction of bigger timeframe could be fine if there is a trend, but in ranging days there could be problems. Another thing, it seems to me, that bigger timeframe changes AFTER the small one. What could help this method (or better say trader) is to watch local Hi/Lows and how far price is from the MA. Higher High in downtrend could be the beggining of range or reversal. Price outstanding far from MA could indicate the strength of momentum, so is the slope of MA. I don't use anything except EMA (with "standard settings" for this method). I don't think oscillators or other indicators could help here... Sorry for the long post (as it was my thread... )

No need to appologise for sharing your idea's. That is what forums are for. The whole thing about this (or any other 'system' for that matter, is tear it apart conceptually. Find it's weak points. How else can one progress without that? Firstly regarding SL's and TP's, I don't use them at all. OK, I might have a bit of an advantage, because I am familiar with the Monster (Believe me, it didn't just appear in a 'eureka' moment, it was all sorts of trying and testing and changing that slowly crept into my subconscious. I do not say that you should not use SL and TP's. But what I think is more important to realise is that a Stop Loss (and a TP too) are like a safetynet insurance, and simply by them being there makes it apparent (both to the observer and the one that placed them on a subconscious leve;, that there is doubt regarding the trade. Naturally we all have our doubts, but if we can hone the skill to try to find (and then enter trades) ONLY on the gold nugget certain profit trades (as if that magic exists), then our doubts are minute. In return, our confidence is also far greater. So we look at a chart and perceive (by whatever means we have found) to find that one nice trade. We expect it tro reach a certain amount of pips, and we also have in our calculated guess a level of how far it might drawdown. If for any reason, the PA deviates from our perceived path that we calculated that the PA would go, that in itself is our SL/TP/EXIT SIGN! As far as your statement regarding the spread on GbpJpy being 'too big', over the last 3 hours, I have increased the balance in my mini account by 24% by scalping GbpJpy during carry trade. My two primary indicators for the scalping are the TickDancer and the TickMonster. I have them spread the entire width of my screen, and the TickMonster is zoomed out to Max, while the TickDancer is two + short of Max zoom. Try it and see the patterns it shows you. Invariably in carry trade there is not great movement, yet it is reptative and usually of similar times between the peak and the trough of a wave. Here are the pip gains/losses of my last 7 trades I have scalped, +1.8 +20.2 -1.4 +6.7 +9.6 +7.0 +8.2 = 52.1 pips total (7.44 pips average/trade) All of those trades used 0.02 lots. This account was zero balance till yesterday. I use this account to live teast any theories/strategies I have in mind. I deposited $4 Aus into the account (the minimum deposit for this account is $1, however $4 gives an almost change of being able to trade with. Any less and the risk reward ration would be so high that 1 bad trade trashes the account, and any more than $4 would be to kind on the test of my trading strategy. After the PayPal transfer Fee, it left me with $3.56 (I forgot about the subtraction of the fee) Yesterday, using The Monster scallop strategy, I Rasied that $3.56 to $5.25. That is a 47% gain. So far today (using scalping only) I have raised $5.25 to $6.51 which is a 24% gain. When I trade my Main Live account, I use the exact same Risk Reward Calculations and the exact same method as I use in the micro account. My main trading account is an MB Trading account, and I can not hedge with that account. So I have to recheck my strategies again without hedging to use in that account. I have not traded with My main account for almost 7 months now, since I was losing consistantly. I chose to hone my skills on the demo field instead. Then after reading The Dance, things in my head went Whirrrrr Click and all sorts of different things became more clear to me. I can not truly explain HOW I see the patterns, since they are not always the same, and as you will notice, the long term 'predictions' like the H4 GbpJpy chart I posted only give a vague idea about one or two possible futures. The same occurs on all charts, but if you can see a pattern or a trend that is happening in the NOW, even if you perceive it might only be that way for 3 or 4 bars, THAT is when you enter your trade, and get out after the 4 Bars! Collect your rent and move on! As a Matter of interest. If any of you wish to see the horendous mistakes I have done in the past (and most likely will do again in the future) as well as the trading on that account since yesterday, then pop in at myfxbook.com, and do a search for BlueMental. You will be able to view the history of that account. BMI &lt;EDIT&gt; LOL, while I was typing this, GbpJpy dropped 86 pips (I did not see it so I didn't trade it) is that perhaps enough to cover the big GbpJpy spread you were talking about? &lt;/EDIT&gt;

If you look at fxhermit's 1st or second post, the one with the channels and trend lines on it, you will see a pretty clear signal those trend lines give. fxhermit uses that method, because that is how he manages to see the 'what is' happening with a pair. I manage to see it too, but with different things pointing it out to me. We all have our own way of seeing things. Some like straight lines and percentages, others are into fiblines, others like pivot points, but in the end, they all revolve around one thing that is only obvious after it goes click in your head. Support and Resistance. MA's are support and resistance. that was one of the things that went click in my head. The other thing that went click in my head was that I must WAIT for a trade to come to me rather than search for one or try to create one. That is something we all know conceptually, but inside we feel like a clock is ticking away and we NEED a trade NOW, just like a heroin addict needs his fix. The thing that finally clicked in my mind was those two things are what the entire Forex Market revolves around, SR and patience. BMI

I just noticed while changing something in the code of TickMonster, that the version I am using is the old SMA version. I am not sure which version I uploaded, (EMA or SMA) The TickDancer is a mixture (MA 35 is supposed to be SMA, while all the others are EMA's) I will see if I can find the correct Version. If not I will sort out the code then re upload the RIGHT versions. BMI.

yo. I am glad to see you suffering with that terrible dissapointment. As you might have seen, I am currently trading a micro account to confirm (to myself) that the Monster is a long term usable strategy before I go into trading larger sums of money with it. LOL, yet what I did (as I so dumbly OFTEN do!!) was break one of my rules. That rule is "DO NOT COUNTERTREND TRADE!!!" So what I ended up in was what can best be described as Spaghetti trading. This hedge helping counter that loss, while this counterhedge 'helps' the failed other hedge. Instead of just cutting my losses as I KNOW I should have, So The account balance before that fiasco, was $6.51. After the Fiasco, it was $0.84 (Trashed!!!) Then I realised, that NzdJpy might be in the running to open a trade with $0.84, so I checked the calculations/conversions and found it worked out. 0.01 lots = $0.80 Margin. So I had ample to spare, and the account Margin Call kicks in at 50%. So I have now got (after 4 trades of small scalps, 12.6+1.7+22.2+21.4=57.9 pips gain bringing the balance up to $1.60 (that is 90.4% gain) I do not know if I can build the account, but I am going to give it my best shot. If one can manage to build an account from $0.84 then I think one could safely say the Monster System works. (Still need to be done though) So, Important reminder, do NOT get overconfidant (like I did) Obey your rules (whatever they are) As far as the currencies strength indicator is concerned, I shall put it in it's own post.

Hi Blue, Enjoying the thread, a big thanks for starting it up. In Msg #42 you wrote .... Could you please clarify the values you use for scaling in differing time frames as I intend to use them in Amibroker. It would also be helpful if you listed which colours are used for each EMA period.

Hi Fun The Mental. I think you might like this indicator. BMI.

Ummm. I don't want to seem dumb, but what are you talking about? BMI.

The clarification is in the math of my text you quoted. If you put a MA1 (meaning it is the moving average of 1 Bar) on the H1 chart, to get the same on the M30 chart, you have to multiply the MA by 2. There are 2 bars per hour in the M30 chart, while the H1 chart has 1 bar per hour. So to duplicate the same MA, you need to spread the MA to use 2 Bars in the M30 chart (because 2 of those bars = 1 H1 (1 hour) bar. In the M15 chart, there are 4 Bars per hour, so MA1 (from the H1 chart) = MA4 (15 minutes x 4 = 1 hour) on the M15 chart. M5 has 12 Bars per Hour (60 minutes / 5 = 12 or another math trick when dividing by 5 is 60*2/10 = 120/10 = 12) So to get the H1 (1 bar per hour MA on the M5 chart, you need your MA to cover 12 of the M5 bars.) M1 = MA60.... (How many minutes in an hour?) To do it in reverse..... A MA1200 in the M1 chart on the H1 chart = 1200 minutes / 60 minutes = 20 hours. So to get a MA1200 (from the M1 chart to be represented on the H1 chart, you use a MA20 on the H1 chart. I can not explain it any better than that. Go on to your MT4 charts and do and see. We only learn by doing. BMI.

A continuation of the micro account 'progress' LOL, I weas doing really well, I got the Equity up to $2.72, and I was in a sell trade which went the wrong way. While I was deciding if I should cut my losses or hedge the Sell, My connection to the broker started acting up. (It was lagging at first then disconnecting. By the time I managed to sort it out, My sell trade was at some high -pip figure (can't recall exactly now, but it was somewhere around -60 pips. Meaning my margin% was EXTREMELY low) So I tried to hedge it and sort it out. While doing that, I was sort of succeeding ( I had manged to get the Equity which had dropped to $0.56) up to around $1.12. The connection was giving me hell all the time though. Here is a small piece cut and pasted from the log file. 18:37:26 '505189': login 18:43:55 '505189': login 18:57:20 '505189': login 18:58:21 '505189': login 19:00:31 '505189': login 19:04:19 '505189': login 19:05:04 '505189': login 19:05:17 '505189': connect failed [No connection] 19:07:36 '505189': login 19:10:49 '505189': login 19:12:21 '505189': ping failed 19:12:41 '505189': login 19:14:21 '505189': login 19:17:47 '505189': login Needless to say, it was not exactly going in my favour, and the account is now truly trashed. So, what did I learn from this? I use internal SL's, so from now on My primary Rule Number 1 as eclayf states in The Dance. Is imediately place a 'hard Stop Loss' on the server. BMI.

The pattern did not follow the prediction. as you can see in the following picture. http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/950...yh4bounced.png Why I say it didn't follow the pattern is because although the price did reach the 134.500 level of the Last white curve, it appeared to me that there would be a drop follwed by two further bounces. Meaning I did not enter a short trade there, waiting for the HigherHigh. However. It also DID follow the pattern, as you can see in the following picture. http://img535.imageshack.us/img535/9...yh4bounced.png A good entry for a short would be the three bars that touch but fail to break above Coral. That brings in a measely 500 pip trade. BMI.

Now the template uploading. I have not forgotten it at all, I have not posted it yet because I need to make a few changes to the 'Engine' so it can be used on any broker's Mt4, then I can upload it at the same time. Be patient... It will happen. BMI.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I have been using your BMI engine over the paste 24 hrs. Really appreciate the work and tools you have incorporated in the version you posted on The Dance thread. Like I said, patiently waiting in anxious anticipation. As for me I will be spending some time with an MT4 simulator to get to a more consistent place. Have a great weekend, RD

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I have decided not to post templates and Profiles, because it is a huge job, which I am not going to do. So download all the indicators and put them on your charts where they suit you. I can not go to the toilet for you. However, here is the updated TickMonster. It now gets the MA's sorted out faster. And The minutes are shown as Dots instead of lines (clearer to see what is going on). The longer term MA's follow the tick price until there is enough of them for the MA to calculated, which is when they go to where they should be. BMI.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Here is the latest version of the BMI_Engine. Updates include:- Now calculates available lots 100% accurately. Added limit filters of server minimum and maximum Lots permited. If you try to place and order for more than Server MaxLots, it will place the MaxLots lot value, while the Server MinLots limits your lot size to the Server MinLots value. Fixed the SL failiure that had a 10 pip SL close at 10 +spread. As far as I am aware, it should now run on all the various Brokers MT4 versions available, but if you find that it gives hassles with your borkers version, just PM me with the details of which Broker Software you are using, and a description of what you did that caused the problem. It should also run on all the various Brokers MT4's for Backtesting. I have not yet tested it on the MBT - MT4 software (which is somewhat different than the standard MT4's as it is set for ECN and has various of the standard MT4 limits removed) but it should run on that one too. BMI.

If you want to find out a bit more of the Currency Trend Indicator elsewhere on the web, check out this site, where you can buy A professional version of the indicator (Together with the System on how best to use it for profitable trading):- http://accustrength.com/ OR You can download it for free right here right now. (An MQ4 indicator version, not the accustrength software) http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/150...cystrength.png The data on this indicator updates in real time, so patience is needed to see the graphs form. It is most useful on the M5 chart, and it calculates the individual strengths of the 8 currencies relative to the days high and low. This means that the data are very biased at the beginning of a new day. After about 6 hours, it is more 'settled in'. (I will one day get around to actually sorting it out to avoid that issue, but it involves quite a lot of codeing, and right now I haven't got the time.) The values displayed on the indicator are the percentage strengths of each currency. So if JPY has a high percentage (80%) and NZD has a low percentage (15%) the graph shows JPY in the upper regions, while NZD is in the lower regions. Once they begin to curve towards each other, (JPY drops, NZD Climbs) then going long on NzdJpy is the order of the day. No, I can hear your thought. These percentage values are not PAIR strengths. They are the strength of the Single currency itself. In the Properties of the indicator, You can use up to 40 pairs to calculate the strength of the 8 single currencies. If you are ok with math, check the code to see how it is calculated. If you are not ok with math, don't ask me how it is calculated, because it will take to much mission to explain. Also, do not ask for details on how to use this indicator, because that in itself would be a separate system thread. Yes it can be used together with the Monster, or any other system for that matter, but there are several places you can find info on currency strengths. Google. Henry Liu(Offers a free .exe version that displays the value's but no graph), Currency Strength, Tom Yeoman (there is still the original free stuff Tom Yeoman distributed as an excel file sneaking around the net.(and mq4 idicators that used the excel files math.) No, my indicator doesn't use or copy any of Tom Yeomans original work, it was all done from scratch, since I did observe the original calculations that Yeoman used, but it was a very complex way of doing simple math and rounded off values so the data was 'approximately' right. Hence it was far simpler to just write my own version. BMI I have only tested this indicator on 2 different broker MT4's, but it should work on all of them.

Ok, I spent some time on setting it up to load up the graphs on history data. Also it now has a settable back period that trails as time continues. The indicator is currently set to 24 hours back and it uses the M5 period. The Currency Strength Graph is totally independant of the Chart it is used in. The only time you will see the graph alter is if your history of the pairs used in the indicator need updating. In other words to test if you are getting a true graph, change the charts Time period. If the graph remains the same, then you are getting true data. If it changes, You can wait a while for MT4 to download the data itself, or you can (if you are impatient) go through all the pairs used in the indicator on the same time period you have set, or alternatively you can download the data in the Tools/History option on MT4. Here are 2 pictures to give you an idea. Experiment with the different timeframes. If both USD and GBP are going down at the same time, check the GgpUsd chart, do the same when they are opposite (1 up one down). This indicator (not like the first one) you can change any of the settings, or the chart timeframe or symbol. The graph remains. http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/2186/strength1.png http://img245.imageshack.us/img245/1967/strength2.png As you can see, GBP is 74, while JPY is 24, what happens when Gbp starts dropping if Jpy climbs at the same time? Check the Exotic Pairs Post and download the excell file to see what it means. BMI

“The fox and the cat were standing on a hill, talking about how many ways they knew of escaping from a pack of dogs. The cat, feeling rather inadequate, said, ‘I only know one way. I run up the nearest tree’. The fox gave the cat a sardonic smile and said, ‘Well, actually, I know fifty different ways of escaping a pack of dogs.’ As they spoke a pack of dogs appeared on the horizon and ran in the direction of the fox and the cat. The cat, utilising his only escape technique, found sanctuary up a nearby tree. Whilst the fox was busy deciding which of the fifty escape techniques he should employ, he got eaten by the pack of dogs.” It does not help in trading to know 587 different ways of making a consistent profit. It does help a great deal to know one method. BMI.

Hi Blue, Thank you for the detailed explanation. I really appreciate the response. With that info I've now created the code for Amibroker. So I should be able to follow any chart postings in my Amibroker charting software and generally follow this thread. I am now looking forward to studying more charts and comments from you. Thanks again.

Hello fellow traders, I am really wondering what is happen here in FF. Such a few people are interested in these thread. I am trading actively almost 3 years. This stuff from BMI improved my trading dramatically and changed my life, because I have now more free time for more pleasant things. And no losing days anymore for sure, even in the last days choppy nature of market (I am talking about Cable ). I remember threads like T101 and others. What a hype, thousands of people, thousands of posts and what? Difficult stuff, for sure. But the easiest things are not able to catch the deserved attention. I am really very grateful BMI, thanks a lot for sharing your ideas. Trade well, Vita

Sorry brucech (and everyone else) I uploaded Currency Strength version 2 on the post with the pictures of it, but somehow it didn't get in there. Doesn't matter really, because I updated Version 2.00 anyway. 1. There was a reduntant double reading of Arrays which ate a huge chunk of cpu power. That is now repaired. 2. If you drag the GBP strength value up, the GBP Graph width gets thick. 3. If you drag the number just a little bit down, it reverts that currencies graph to thin. 4. If you drag the strength number down a lot, it reverts all the currency strengths to thin. I prefer to do things the easy way, as opposed to having to open the properties and individually alter things there each time. BMI.

Hi Vita. I shall tell you a little story that happened to me. A tourist was driving a Car, and he asked me if I could take a look at it for him. It had a strange problem. When driving up hill, it was fine, yet when driving downhill, the car would accelerate so much that he had to turn the engine off each time it happened to avoid having an accident. I took a look at his carburettor, and I noticed that he had bought the car in Europe, and it had an added on feature that increases the acceleration for really cold days. Being in Africa, we do not experience cold days, so our cars do not have that feature. After opening up the mechanism, I noticed that the little belt that does the job was stretched, and that was why his car was accelerating. Since the belt was stretched, it worked fine when accelerating the car, but it hit a stronger resistance when trying to decelerate, so it slipped. That was why his car was running away on downhills. I told him that for 100 euro's I would make an adaption plate and remove the mechanism. He insisted that he wanted to replace the belt. After explaining to him that since we are in Africa, we do not stock the parts for that mechanism, and it would need to be imported from Europe. He stated things about 'warrenties on the car etc.' so he wanted a new belt. After phoning the cars local agent, I was told (three days later) that the belt does not get sold separately, and one has to buy the entire mechanism for 1300 Euro's. The courier fee's was 300 Euro's. I mentioned this to the guy who owned the car, who had been staying in a hotel while waiting for this info. He also could not drive anywhere while this was happening. The company would only courier the mechanism once they had received and confirmed payment, which took from 5 to 10 working days, and the courier would take another 5 to 10 days to reach it's destination. Meaning he stood a good chance of being in the hotel for another 2 to 3 weeks. He then finally agreed that rather than spend 1600 Euro's on the mechanism, and spend his entire holiday (which was 1 month in total he had planned for) in a hotel spending more Euro's there, that he would accept the original adaption plan. I charged him 100 Euro's for the adaptation, and a further 200 Euro's for all my work related to sourcing and telephoning about the mechanism. The whole procedure from when he first discussed it with me, to the completion of the job was 1 week. If he had agreed to the adaption on day 1, he would have had his car running safely down hills the following day. The point of this story is this. Many people like to think that the more bells and whistles something has, that the more effective it is. I prefer the Occam's Razor approach to life. If something is not needed or does not benefit the whole, then get rid of it! One other thing to think of is this. You have been trading actively for almost 3 years, which gives you the benefit of knowing that less is often more. You have (just like me) tried the four thousand three hundred and sixty two thousand five hundred and sixty eight indicators and systems and methods. So distill what you know into the least amount of working parts and build a solid rule based system on that. Do yourself a favour, do NOT get enticed by the currency strength indicator. It has merits, but you have to remember 500 different things to get it to start being effective. The Monster is simpler. After using it for a while, you find you don't even need to think, you just 'feel' the entries and exits. I am glad you find it useful. BMI.

Hi kesterprogz. Just download the version 2.01 instead. If it does not work, you must make sure that you type the pairs that your broker offers EXACTLY as they are written. You must use Capital Letters GBPJPY or if your account is a micro account it might be GBPJPYm BMI.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi FxDwarf I would suggest that you first try it on backtesting, if you don't know how to I will show you how, just ask. After that try it on demo mode. Only once you are comfortable and profit consistantly in demo mode, only then start trading your micro account. It is actually more difficult to trade with a small capital of money than with a large amount, so it is a great way to learn Forex. The second thing I would recomend is this. Once you are making consistant profit in your micro account, do NOT deposit more money. Build your micro account into a standard account. If you succeed, you will never deposit another cent into your account, only withdraw. The key to profitable trading is not getting the huge gains. It is by reducing the losses. Set yourself a set of rules. An example. 1. I will enter a short (sell) trade if the Price Action (PA) has crossed below GrandMa and GrandPa and it touches and bounces back below Grandma, and Daughter (Firebrick 47MA), GrandPa AND GrandMA are all pointing down 2. I will set a StopLoss at the last High before I opened the trade. 3. I will move my StopLoss to +2 pips as soon as I can. 3. I will close the trade if the PA climbs above Daughter (FireBrick 47MA) 4. I will close the trade if Daughter shows signs of turning upwards. You will find your own rules because we all see things differently, your rules will not be exactly the same as mine. The important part is that you OBEY your rules. The very second you start hearing thoughts in your head of 'it has hit the close rule of 'xyz' BUT it looks like it will be profitable, is the same second you turn a profitable strategy into a losing strategy. If you do NOT stick to your rules, then you are gambling. If you gamble, you can only lose in the long term. BMI.

Hi BMI, First of all congrats on your posts, I was first of all confused because it is not the typical thread with a cookbook recipe, (buy if x and y and z happens....), however your last post about how we should get on with this, (backtest, demo account, etc.) Clearly every one I would like to ask you two questions that are still confusing me, apologies if you have already answer them: 1) How do you use the EMA(5) in the big MACD settings 2) Would be possible to list all the EMAs and names? I am a bit lost about the names of the family, i.e. Grandpa: EMA500 (Indigo) Grandma: EMA290 (Purple) ??? : EMA5 (Maroon) Mother: EMA47 (Firebrick) Daughter: EMA14 (Coral) ??? EMA2 (Golden) Thank you

Hi again, I have just notice during the last few hours how price reacted to EMA(47) (Mother?) Below is a H4 chart of EURGBP, price is clearly rejected out of EMA47, it would seem it should continue down. Would be possible for you to take a look a this pair and tell us what you see? Thank you

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I decided to call EMA 5 (Maroon) Cousin EMA 2 (Golden) 2nd Cousin I use them mostly to see (confirm) that they bounce off the other EMA's. They are not really needed, but since they form the MacD (If you read the whole thread you will see how they appear on the MacD itself) and they help as a form of subconscious view of the MacD. As far as a solid set of rules (if x do y) I am still working on clear enrety and exit points on the live edge. I see the entry and exit points because I look at the whole as a form of patterns. But each person has their own wants and needs. For example, I am a more aggressive type of trader, so I prefer to wait until I see a trade form that I feel will give me a high possibility of getting 400 to 1000 pips trades. I use the same bounce off SR's (the MA's and the RN's) on the small and big timeframes. But I spend most of my focus on the TickMonster. When it is zoomed out to full, and stretched wide across the screen, it shows enough to see a true trend change. So I wait until I see that the trend has fully reversed. Let us say it was going up , then the GrandPa and GrandMa level out in the TickMonster, and then GrandMa crosses below GrandPa. I then wait to see Daughter come back up to touch (or try to) GrandMa then gets bounced back down. I confirm that there is a bounce off one or more (preferably more than one) on the D1, H4, M15 charts, then I enter with a high Balance to Lots traded ratio. (I usually use 40% of my capital) I use a second TickMonster which is not zoomed out too much for the actual entry point. I watch the Small MacD EMA's on the 2nd TickMonster. (Mother, Daughter and 2nd Cousin). By doing this, it allows me a smaller risk of a high drawback. For the SL I use the Last High on the M15 chart plus a buffer zone (varies depending on which pair you are trading. Here is a useful link from James Lampert. This is 2 free videos and a text download as part of his promotion for his package. http://freedomforexformula.com/private.html BMI.

EurGbp is an excotic that loves up and down jumping. If you look at the D1 chart (zoomed out) You will see that PA is just below GrandPa and is hitting but failing to break below 0.850 I would stay away from trading this pair until the RN of 0.850 is resolved. (Either PA bounces and heads north, or breaks through and heads South.) The M15 chart patterns look show signs of heading North and South at the same time. (The PA and both cousins are above Mother, but Mother is restrained below GrandMa) Trading this pair is a gamble. It can easily spike 300 pips in a day and jump back down to starting point. I would not trade this pair at all unless I had absolutely clear and confirmed medium to long term trades in both GbpUsd and EurUsd that contradict each other. (One going up while the other goes down) In simpler terms, EurGbp should have a sign for forex traders "Here Be Danger!!" Finally, to predict.... I recon that PA will break below 0.850 and drop at least 500 pips, but I would not touch it with a ten foot pole. Although, It is very similar to the GbpJpy layout. The maim difference is that I am totally unfamiliar with the EurGbp personality. I will follow a bit further on EG and see if anything good pops up. GbpJpy is not clear to me either at the moment. I am not seeing any clear patterns for north or south. It is possible my headspace needs clearing, or the PA is in a state of flux. Both these pairs are excotics (EurGbp and GbpJpy) so since I am not clear I stay out. BMI. &lt;EDIT&gt; http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/248...h4eurgbph4.png Here are the two compaired (EurGbp and GbpJpy) The blue numbers (89 in EurGbp and 503 in GbpJpy are the pip values above Bid of their resperctive lines.) By looking at these two charts, would you say that the fact that PA touching Mother can be used as a clear indication of anything with EurGbp? It is a minefield, and the pip movements is erratic and tiny in comparison with GbpJpy (or GbpUsd) Here in the GbpJpy picture, there is a clear smooth pattern. It seems most likely that since PA and both cousins are above Mother and they failed to break below 130.000 ( a VERY strong Round Number) that they will probably go North at least to 135.000. The scallop shape is in it's ending stage, but is not completely ended yet. It is also the first scallop in a long term down trend. The Price will most likely drop and bounce off 130.000 again before going North to visit the GrandParents. If PA breaks below 130 and Mother gets below 130 as well, then we can expect a long term down trend. I am happy to wait this one out and not trade til I see both cousins below Mother again. Then I will wait for PA (and the 2 cousins get bounced down off Mother for an entry signal. That means I might only scalp trade if at all for the next 20 to 30 4 hour Bars unless something major changed over the weekend. &lt;/EDIT&gt;

Hi Bluemental Thank you for the wonderful thread. I am setting up the charts right now to followtonight Re; currency strength I saw an indicator in forex tsd called "Complex" based on RSI I think. May be you have seen it before. I do not know how to attach it to show you anyway thank you again Senbanda

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi Senbanda. I generally ignore (and never use) the Currency Strength Indicator. It has it's uses, but it is too (as named in the TSD post you mentioned) complex. The amount of trials, tests and calculations to figure it all out are just plain too much work, and for the profits you receive in pips in return, I consider it not worth all the effort. The thing is that it seldom ever happens that Long Term Trends of the individual Currencies, alter seperately (In other words diverge or converge) to be of any great value, so in truth it is a moot point. I find it far easier to try to see the likelyhood of an emerging pattern, and if the PA goes according to my guessed pattern, then I enter a long term trade on that basis. I am still testing all this on demo, and I am finding it quite solid so far, and on the intraday level, more often than not, I can comfortably gain 30 to 50 pips with a relatively low risk per day, which allows me to use a high percentage of my capital to trade. The last few days have been relatively slack on the GbpJpy pair because she appears to be in the process of refersing trend into an uptrend. There were Intraday trades available, but my 'eye' was not seeing anything I felt confident enough to trade. So I chose to wait until I see some patterns I am confident with. If you prefer the Currency Strength Stuff, then Go for it. It is just not a style/system I enjoy. However, I do sometimes hit some rough patches by NOT paying enough attention to the fundamental side of Forex, and the Currency Strength Indicator is a nice indicator to see on a chart the Markets view of which Currencies are trending where. Just as a Matter of interest everyone, I do not know if any of you checked up on Henry Liu, but he is going to be doing a FREE webinar of NFP and the preceding CAD Employment Change. He will be trading it live, and it will well be worth the watch. It is hosted by TradeTheNews.com He does not trade the spike trades, he trades after initial spke retrace similar to Felix Homogratus Method (from Forex Peace Army - or if you been in the game for a while from ForexBastards) Give it a look at this link http://www.henryliuforex.com/2008/le...s-friday-live/ or go directly to register for the webinar at this link https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/780231185 Enjoy.

Lets see how good the Monster is at News Predictions. I am *NOT* suggesting that this guess will mean anything in regards to the NFP news, so please do NOT use this as a "He said" reason to trade. It is nothing more than a guess, and I am only posting it before the News so *I* can see if it turns out to have any validity. Assuming it DOES turn out to be correct (and that is a big if) then it would need to do the same several times, if not hundreds of times to be worth even thinking of using The Monster in this way. I think you can clearly see that you have been warned to ignore this prediction! Based on the fact that right now we are about 8 H4 bars prior to News time, and this picture shows PA has reached slightly above the 92.00 Round Number, as well as GrandPa and GrandMa, while Daughter is above Mother and the Siblings are heading North. They are near the end of the upward Retrace (In the third Bounce), which appears to be the end of the first Mother Scallop. They have not conclusively broken above the GrandParents and the Round Number of 92.00 Which is a strong RN. If we ignore the drastic drops that created the previous low as 'Panic Noise', then this low is NOT a Higher Low. It seems to me (pattern wise) to be a Lower Low. In this case also added to the fact that Daughter is in her third bounce, together with the end of the Mother Scallop, then it appears (in the same HH,LL configuration) that we are near the end of the Lower High. The Cousin form is a bit confusing though to my eye. It has gone from Bounce to scallop and back to bounce without there being any reversal or retracement. I think the Mother Scallop is going to hold form and end here and the second scallop will be starting. I think the PA will break above GrandPa, GrandMa and RN to reach the 92.500 or possibly the 93.00 level, and will bounce back off there and reverse. I also think that the form of the Cousin shape will be a Scallop, so my prediction for NFP will be a negative number causing UsdJpy to drop around 50 to 70 pips which will apear to be the trigger of a reversal. The other two alternatives could be a weak positive reading with a small spike that reaches up to/above 93.00 but bounces back, or a the News is a no trigger event after which a 'natural' reverse will occur. All in all I say that tomorrow the UsdJpy will be in the early stages of a 2 week down trend. BMI. http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/8937/nfpprediction.png

Hi BlueMental Just read your posts I have "Complex" on G/Y and it sort of shows direction in lower TFs Just an extra confirmation I am following your method-trying to understand. Will be watching NFP today Thank you senbanda

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi senbanda. If you say you are using "complex" on GY, then it is not the same as the Currency Strength Indicator. The way you describe it, it runs on pairs, while the currency strength indicator gives the strength i=of the individual currencies. So using it to relate to GY, you need to view it in the following way. The GY is a cross pair of GbpUsd and UsdJpy. So you need to view the individual strengths of three currencies. Being The Great British Pound (GBP), The US Dollar (USD) and the Japanese Yen (JPY) Let us say that GBP is 58, USD is 84, and JPY is 88, while their graphs show GBP dropping, while JPY and USD are rising, but JPY is rising at a greater pace than USD. This means that Jpy is stronger here than USD (as is also shown by the 88 to 84 number) If you only account for GBP and JPY, then it males sense, because if GBP is getting weaker than JPY, Then GbpJpy is dropping in value. But what happens when Jpy is rising while Usd is rising more? This has a direct influence on the GbpUsd price, so it brings all sorts of calculations into play to be able to figure out the whole deal. It is in essense a 'shades of gray' scenario. Also, with the strength indicator, it is difficult to see if and when the direction of the trends change in the real time side of the graph. It is great as a hindsight tool. But in real time, there is no real way of knowing or even guessing if the trends will reverse or retrace. About the only thing that allows us to guess this is (as you can see on my initial v2 picture) the two horizontal trend lines I drew near the top and bottom of the chart. In other words, since JPY and USD are both above 80%, they are likely to switch direction. While GBP is near the center (58%) and can go either up or down. These are assumptions that are based on looking through the previous pathways of the individual currency strengths, and in truth are basically meaningless. There is no clear definitive pattern to allow us to have evemn a 0.5% better chance than simply tossing a coin and saying heads buy, tails sell. It is a great indicator if you wish to spend time writing a thesis on how the various interactions between the individual currency strengths affect each other, and if you go deep enough into it, you might even get the Economic version of the Nobel Prize by doing all that study, but what good is it with regard to Forex Trading in the now? The only time this chart assists in real time trading is if you are observing it, and GBP suddenly starts jumping up from 58 to 60 to 65, while simultaneously, USD starts dropping from 84 to 80 to 75. Even when that is the case, do you enter a long trade? And if so, how big a change do you wait for in those figures that count as 'proof'? Now if you look at the PA of the GbpJpy in the same picture, you can see that the cousins were below the Daughter from the beginning of the chart, and Mother is leveling out, while the 2 cousins are slightly above Daughter. I have entered a long trade here, but I actually entered it too early. I still have no idea if the PA will break or even go up to touch Mother. Mother has not turned, and the cousins are not yet above daughter (and preferably Daughter above Mother too). It is far easier to see where in the scheme of things one is with the EMA's. If I was in a short trade from somewhere near the beginning of the chart, I woul NOT have closed the trade where I entered the long position. I would only close it after Daughter crosses above mother and the 2 cousins try to cross back down and get bounced above Daughter, which would be at the very least a 70 pip gain. That is the same thing I should have waited for to enter the long position. (When Daughter crosses Mother, that is when Mother turns.) If you notice, at the end of the chart, you can see a small section of GrandMa. If Daughter crosses above Mother, and the Cousins can not break back below Daughter, then there is an 80% likelihood that the PA will reach at the very least halfway to touching GrandMa and possibly more. So if one were to wait for the relevant signs to occur one should be able to enter a long position at line 1, and reach at least near line 2. That would be a 60 pip + profitable trade, with a very low risk of failure. 130 Pips possible in 5 hours. Since they are both low risk trades, then the Risk Reward Ratio can be adjusted to suit. Assuming you usually trade with 2%, and if the risk is low you up your risk to 4%, that is double the profit. I trade on medium risk at 40% on low risk at 70%. In a short trade, (use the one I am not in), my first SL would be a few pips (in GbpJpy, a few pips is 15 or so) above the previous High, (Under the U in the EUR text), I would have put my 2nd SL just above the first retrace high (Underneath the CHF, 47 text), My next SL would be above the next retrace high, (Below the JPY 88 text) my third and most likely final SL would be above the next retrace high (exactly where my Long entry is). It would either have been hit now, or be perhaps 1 or 2 pips away from being triggered. That is definately not a bad pip gain for 'scalping' om the M5 chart. I am not saying that the "complex" indicator you speak of is bad. I am also not saying that the Currency Strength indicator is bad. I do not know the "complex" indicator, but as far as the Currency Strength Indicator is concerned, there is simply 'too much stuff' involved with it for it to have any value, and I personally do not get any confidence from having it on my chart.

Here is the after NFP picture for Usd Jpy. The total drop from Scallop start which NFP triggerred was 170 Pips. http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/1...enfpusdjpy.png And here is the after NFP picture for GbpJpy. Pretty much the same shape formations with one small difference. The total drop from Scallop start which was triggerred by NFP was 509 Pips.

Hi BMI, great job! i like ur indicator thanx.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi, I also like MACD , some lucky day,i have earned 140+ pip in one single day. But most of the time i see lots of Whipsaw in the market. how to avoid it,specially in 5 min and 1 min chart. Can you provide some settings on those chart with filtering those whipsaws.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
hello BMI, Hope you're doing well this year ! I'd like to report that Tickmonster_Arrows2.mq4 doesn't seem to draw grandma and grandpa correctly. -slowpork

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Yo slowpork. If I recall, the TickMonster that I uploaded at that time, glued the averages to the white line (Current Tick) until enough ticks were passed to have the actual average. The reason for that was it was easier to see that the TickMonster is more valid once all the MA's have separated from the White line. In a slow market, it can sometimes take 30 minutes or more before GrandMa and GrandPa become visably active. The version after that gives no average lines before the relevant amount of ticks have passed. It also allows you to alter the number of ticks used for the averages. Unfortunately I got a bit lazy and TickMonster is confined to use as SMA's. When I get a chance I will set it up to be the same as Big and SmallMac with EMA's. I might be incorrect in the detail here, since I upgraded the Tickmonster Indicator quite a few times. What I will do is upload a zip file of all of the Monster indicators. Meaning that the newer and updated versions will be more functional and correct. The Family Hierachy of names is also now in the new indicators, meaning if you hover over any specific EMA, it is listed by name (Mother, Grandma etc.) I hope to have a chance to collect and do the zip file within the next few days. Yo NewStar. As a general preference, I sometimes do trade on the faster timeframes, but I always zoom out to max to see the 'bigger picture' I also look at the slower timeframes as a reference. Once you begin to get more familiar with the particular pattern structure of The MacdMonsters, it becomes a little easier to see in realtime. In a hindsight after the fact chart, it is very easy to see and say 'Here is where I should have entered' but in the realtime edge, it is safer to wait a while for a confirmation. If you are trading on the faster timeframes, you can usually see on the next one or two up if you are experiencing a retrace or a reversal. If it is only a retrace you can usually see if it will again drop to a profitable range for your trade. Example:- If you had entered a short trade at the start of the red Trend Line, the M5 chart shows you are most likely to be entering a 'Reversal' to the Long side on the M1 timeframe. The pattern in both the M1 and the M5 are showing that PA is above and is highly likly to stay above. You should not enter a trade in the M1 Timeframe without looking at the M5 and M15 charts first, preferably the M30 chart too. A single warm day in Winter does not mean that it is suddenly summer. Only by viewing the slower timeframes can we get a feel for the Trend. They can seem contradictory, but they are not, since the pattern is cyclic and fractal in nature and it is in all the time frames, from Tick Chart through to a Century chart or more. If H4 and H1 and M30 are in a downtrend, then a push above GrandMa and GrandPa on M5 or M1 is usually just a retrace that is shortlived. Retraces and Reversals are subjective when compared to longer timeframes. A retrace in M5 is a reversal in M1, but only a minor movement on the H4 chart. Scalping is a tricky tightrope. Rather be patient and wait for a 'safe' 20 or 30 pips or more trade instead. I prefer to trade primarily on the H4 Timeframe, using the faster timeframes for specific entry clarification instead. I aim for the 150 to 200 plus pips trades where possible. I put a SL +- 100 pips below my entry point, and if my profit reaches 100 pips I move the SL to Break Even. NOT before that. The PA usually has 'whipsaw' and it takes a while to get above it (or below if going short). The more you practice the more easy you are able to see the patterns and recognise them. The most important thing I have found is that you need to stick to any particular system, and set yourself a set of rules that suit your temperament. Then treat those rules as unbreakable. If you deviate from your rules, you always end up in hot water. No system is perfect. No system is 'easy'. There is NO magic rub the lantern Genie. Persistant and 'Boring' trading is profitable. Risk Management is paramount. For example if your system is set to trade using 5% of your Account Balance, then you need to test how many losses in a row you can absorb before it trashes your account. This you compare with your systems results for Win:Loss ratio and if your long term average of wins is greater than your long term losses, then your system and Risk Management is solid. You can not chase water under the bridge, and even more important is once you hit a losing streak (it happens), just cut your losses, get out and do not trade any further that day. Come back to trade the next day or possibly even later when your mindset and mood are refreshed and clear. Panick Trading, Hopeful Trading and Recovery Trading are almost never positive. http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/139/m1m5confirm.png I have been working on other ways to fine tune the accuracy of 'safer' trades. Using other indicators etc. I have 1 indicator that is so far outperforming the others, but I have not got it good enough to my satisfaction yet to post. Always place a Stop Loss. Never increase your Stop Loss Risk. In other words if your trade is a short and your initial SL is just above the previous High, never take it higher. If it gets hit, then it gets hit. The only time it is ok to change your Stop Loss is if you lower it to a Lower High, or to Break Even. Making profit is not at all about increasing your wins. It is actually all about decreasing your losses. BlueMental

Hi BlueMental Do you still trade this system as per the original rules? how did it fare since you started? I find it really impressive and accurate. Thanks for your contribution

Greetings All. I have not posted here for a long time. @ gogoprovost. Yes I do trade by the original rules, however sometimes it is not that easy to see clearly at the right live edge of the screen. It is very easy to see after the fact. (Hindsight is 20/20 vision). So what I do (which took me quite a while to do with every trade) is place my stop loss imediately to the previous high or low (depending if I'm going short or long) + spread + 2 or 3 pips. I found that in the past, I felt that the trade would follow the path and it did not, ending in losing many pips. I also find that the best use of the Monster is to trade on the H4 chart. There are not so many trades, but they are extremely lucrative when they do occur and are easier to see and confirm that they are going along the path described while still having enough movement left to make a profitable trade. In other words before entering the trade, I wait for at least 3 or 4 bars after the Price Action has dropped below Mother (Red EMA-47) and has reached up to test going back above and failed . If this is done in the shorter time frames, there are more opportunities, but the run is far less pips. However the pattern is the same in all time frames. I have also noticed that the News events usually follow the pattern shape as well, and if they go in the opposite direction, they revert very quickly. The News events can be profitable, but they require a totally different way of trading and is more a 'scalper' type of trade and to me they are just not worth all the hassle. BlueMental.

Just a quick message - I am experimenting since a few months with various versions and settings of MACD, and I found this thread to be simply amazing. Still not quite grasping the scallop concepts on lower time-frames, but my main trades are anyhow 4h and daily. A BIG thank you to BlueMental, I hope he is still around occasionally and fares well.

Hi All. I have developed a new indicator that is based on Magic Monster, channels and Gann Grids. It offers the key to when to enter and exit trades if used in conjunction with Magic Monster. If you people are interested, just post and I will give more details. (In other words, is this thread dead, or do you want that extra 'edge' added to the Monster?) Blue Mental

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Blue, I´m always interested in great thinkers like you. go ahead !

Hi BlueMental, I would like to see that extra "edge" added to the Monster.. Thank you Sabrina

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hello Bluemental, I am still subscribed to this thread no matter if the Mayan´s got it right or not. If they did predict correctly, I will resubscribe immediately after finding myself on a new planet ( named " Blue " ? )..... Seriously speaking, I still apply your Magic Monster indicator to my charts, although I find it seems to work best on higher timeframes. I would of course be grateful for any new ideas - plus good to see you`re alive and well ( hopefully ). Only the best to you ! Michael

--- 帖子 #175 ---
yep...i love the MACD....I'm interested!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Ok, there is obviously interest. BUT there is a vast amount of stuff needed to cover to make any sense of what the new indicator shows. Not only that, the journey that I have been on (mental/philosophical journey) has allowed me to see/gain a deeper understanding of the Monster, and more than that, of Currency Pairs, Stock, the price of goods at the grocery store and how rivers flow. This means that there is work involved. Without looking into (at least partially) how Gann Grids work and the basics of channels and channel breaks, this new indicator will not be very useful. It will show resistance and supports, but without the deeper understanding, seeing these supports and resistances will not leave you any clue as to when the price is likely to break through a resistance or 'randomly' change direction. If you are prepared to put in the work, I am happy to share what I know/have. If you merely want to 'see' then I am not prepared to put in the hours. Your response? BlueMental

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Michael, believe it or not, The Mayan's are so 100% spot on that it is freaky. First of all, the 'end of the world' aspect to the Mayan calendar (one of their calendars) is very much a Western point of view. It is merely the end of a cycle. A HUGE cycle, but never the less, it is a cycle. It is the shifting of suns. Another way of saying it is the death of the age Pisces and the beginning of the age of Aquarius. In a way, the Gann Grid, Pyrapoint Tequnique, My new Indicator which I have name Magic Moving Channels and the Mayan calendar all do the same thing. They observe and 'chart' cycles of the energy of things. Most of the current use and understanding of Gann grids is way off the mark. The Pyrapoint Method once studied in a bit of depth is an eye opener of note. He is the only one I have discovered so far that understands the cyclic nature of the markets and how and when they are most likely to change and why. He explains in his book in detail about this. He has studied this for +- 30 years. We will go into what I understand about the Pyrapoint side of things, (which I regret to say is very limited knowledge.) After understanding Pyrapoint a bit more than just looking at the charts of it, it quite literally dumps you in the middle of a paradigm shift. You will never see the charts in the same way again. By seeing this, allows you to notice the predominant 'failure' of Gann Grids. They are static and they are confined (at least in the Mt4 they are) to horizontally latticed 'diamonds'. The reality is that they (the Gann grids) are actually dynamic. My indicator is dynamic Hence I call it 'moving'. Though it does not actually 'move', the fulcrums that the channels follow alter in response to the market movement. The 'standard' Gann Grid does not. Those are the basic descriptions of what we will be discussing/exploring for a deeper understanding so that after all is said and done, that they can allow us to make confident and profitable trades. BlueMental &lt;edit&gt; ps Michael, my user name is BlueMental - with a capital M, I am in life, a Freelance trader (among other things) and my name, is Lance (and I am Free) Blumenthal.

Ja asseblief Blue, please continue! Here is something I'm trying out. It's your EMAs on swingman's Pama Gann grid.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Nog a Sefrican, ek het gedink ek is die enigste een. No, Hansie, I don't know the Pama Gann thingy in your Pics. No BS, but to me it looks like an attempt to get something out of the Gann mindset but misses badly. One thing you need to understand about Gann, is that he traded with an accuracy of +- 80% winning trades. Though he did seminars and stuff like that, he never gave away his secret. He died in 1955 and he used to charge $5000 per seminar. You can imagine, $5k then was big money. Before we actually go into having a look at the grid, do you know anything about the cube of 9? Do any of you guys/girls know anything about the cube of 9?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
OK, a couple of things. ( The American version of 'a couple of things' means 2 things, the South African version of 'a couple of things, could be anywhere from 2 (but not often) to at least 5 or more... 1. I assume that all of you have read and basically understand the whole makeup of the Magic Monster. If not, please read this thread from the beginning. If you don't understand the Monster, you will just get more lost than you already are. 2. Another thread here in FF was written by haiderfsd called GGG - Gann Grid Group Trading at http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...ght=gann+group It will do you a lot of good to go read what he has to say about trading with the Gann Grid. The most important piece of info that he shares is that by using the grid, he waits until the price moves into either the Buy Zone, or the Sell Zone. After it is in one of these zones, only then do you wait for the signal to buy (in the buy zone) or sell (in the sell zone. Although he is using the Gann Grid as a tool, he is not really using the Gann Grid. I will explain this clearly later, just remember this 'weird statement for now. 3. If you do not have a MBTrading - Desktop Pro - demo account (NOT the Mt4 demo, they run on different servers) Desktop Peo installed, NOT Desktop standard. Then please do yourself a favour and install them. In the Desktop Pro trading platform, they have a 'drawing tool' called Pyrapoint, which was designed by Don Hall. (Just Google "Don Hall Pyrapoint" and you will find his website. You can also check lots of pictures of charts with Pyrapoint on them on the MBTrading Forums, but you can only check the pics if you have registered with them. If you are not, and do not want to go to the trouble of doing so, don't stress, it is not too important. 4. If you are not familiar with channels, and channel breakouts, or trends and trend (with trend lines) and trend reversals or breakthroughs, you can find some good pics here on this thread by FXHermit. In noticing how the breakouts work, you will also notice that while haiderfsd uses the Gann Grid, it is in essence, the channel and trend breakouts that he is following. He is not speaking about specific time frames that the grid actually shows when and where the breakouts are most likely to happen. 6. If you have not downloaded BMILong__.mq4 (The actual MacD indicator I wrote that the 6 EMA's of the Monster are based on.) you can find it here :- http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...27#post3708227 That is more or less a couple of things...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hansie. (Also to everyone) OK, I took a look at the pictures and the Pama Gann indicator (on the pics, I didn't download the indicator). To me, I see no useful way to use that indicator. I am not saying it is a bad indicator. If a person understands what the creator of the indicator knows and sees, then maybe it is useful. If you were to go long at the start of the green stripes, and close when they end, you end up with some good and some bad trades, same with the red. If you trade using the thin yellow line (the price itself) and where it breaks through the Orange and red lines, you are in essence doing a limited Magic Monster type of style but there is not enough in just 2 ema's to see the full patern. In short, this indicator (for me that is) is way too complicated. I only have an IQ of 7 so I can't understand the indicator. Everything is based on patterns. Nature does not use a calculator. Nature also does not have a straight line. Everything is curves and moves in waves, just like a woman, or a cat. The way the price moves is just like a woman (or a cat) she can change direction for no reason that any man can understand or see, but to her it is simple and makes perfect sense. Just because men do not understand the reason, does not mean there is no reason. Men are simply blind to that reason. If a man asks a woman why she is upset with him, then he sleeps on the couch because he asked! She can not understand how he can be so blind and NOT know. Prices are exactly the same. If you look closely at any chart, you will see that there is a clear style, a way that she walks. Different pairs walk with different styles. UsdJpy is very different from GbpJpy. These women have different personalities. Grumpy Grandma (GbpJpy) is a bit of a schizophrenic. Sometimes she is smooth and sensual with a nice sway of her hips. Other times she is choppy and argumentative throwing Kung Fu moves up and down so fast it hits you sideways, If you ever saw the movie with Al Pacino called "Scent Of A Woman," you will understand what I mean. It is not about 'calculating' when GrumpyGran will be changing direction, or how high or low the price will go. That is an accountant thing. A thing of numbers and maths. GG (GrumpyGran) doesn't work on numbers. She, just like any woman, works on the feel of things. The mood of things. It is by becoming familiar with her style, her energy that we can begin to understand her mood. At the same time we can not ever think "I know exactly what she will do next." She, just like any person, doesn't want to feel like their every move, thought and action is under investigation. Like they are spied on every minute of the day. The Judge and Jury can not ever be friends with those they judge. Those that are judged can not ever give freely of anything to those that judge them. We need to get the idea of calculating and figuring her out so we can use her to our ends and means out of our minds. We enter into a relationship with the energy of the currency. If we try to be her master, in a sly way, she will be our master. If we are her friend and companion, she will be our friend and companion. By knowing her as a friend, we eventually begin to recognise her little wink or frown that tells us (her friends) that we should NOT think that she is going north (like everyone else at that time thinks) but she is actually going south.

Hi BlueMental, Not bad for a guy with only an IQ of 7... i never thought about trading in these terms.. very fascinating.. i gave this thread a speed reading, but now i will read it from the beginning with much more attention. Thank you Sabrina P.S. I know nothing about the cube of 9... i only know that in geometry is a sort of hypercube with a lot of vertices, edges and square faces.. i would like to learn more about it.. how is it related to trading?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Gann Theory You can find descriptions of the Gann Wheel, The Cube of 9 and the Gann Circle floating around on the net. The most important aspect of anything related to Gann Theory is that Price is the X axis on the chart, and Time is the Y axis, and they are co-dependant on one another. By knowing the price, one can determine the when of critical changes. The Cube of 9 is a 'simple' presentation of 9 numbers that make up a square. Starting with 1 in a square in the centre of the page, you draw a square to the left in which you put the number 2, then above number 2 you draw another square, being number 3. A square to the right, number 4, to the right again, number 5, down, number 6, left number 7, left number 8, left number 9. The sequence is a clockwise placing of integers, increasing by one and it continues until, you run out of paper, ink, sanity, patience or years in your life. In other words it goes on infinitely. http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/3...beof9start.png The horizontal thin lines (the row of numbers ...11, 2, 1, 6, 19...) are 0 degrees left of number 1 (centre of the square) while 180 degree goes to the right of number 1. The vertical column (...15, 5, 1, 8, 23...) are 90 and 270 degrees. The grey squares are 45, 135, 225 and 315 degrees. The blue lines are the halfway degree markers between it's neighbours. Sp the number 22 falls halfway between 21 (225 degrees) and 23 (270 degrees) so 22 is 247.5 degree or 225+ (45/2) = 247.5. The square of 3 is 9. Notice that the first grey square on the 315 degree line (bottom left of no. 1) is 9. The next odd number after 3 is... (obviously) 5, and the square of 5 is 25. The second cycle of numbers, or the second grey square in the 315 degree line is 25. If you use even numbers, the square of 2 is 4. The first grey square in the 135 degree line (top right of no.1) is NOT 4, but notice that exactly 1 square to it's left is. The square of the next even number, 4 is 16. Notice that the second grey square in the 135 degree line has immediately to it's left, the number 16. This sequence continues into infinity. The square of the even numbers are 1 to the left of the 135 degree line, while the square of the odd numbers are on the 315 degree line. This means that one full cycle of the square (me dunno why they call it the 'cube' of Nine when it is a square) has at opposite corners (1 square off for 135) 2 squares. Call them Summer and Winter. Yin and Yang, Male and Female... You get the idea. ( A side note, one 'law' of Bucky Fullers is that you can not have a Unity of anything less than 2, and one cycle is two squares, not 1) So why are all the other lines there? Well the first square of 2, being 4 lies 1 to the left of top right(135 degrees) and the second square of 3, being 9, lies on the bottom left (315 degrees). 315-135 = 180 degrees of travel. 3-2 (the base numbers for the two respective squares) = 1. One full cycle of the square gives us two squares of two sequential numbers (2 and 3 in this case) yet the 'travel' in degrees is only half of 360 (180 degrees)/ So the value of 1 (half of a Unity of two) is represented in 180 degrees of the cycle. The 360 degrees represents the value of two, the conclusion of the Unity of two. Following that, if we were to 'travel' 90 degrees instead of 180 degrees. 90 degrees being 1/4 of 360 degrees, and also represents 1/4 of the full cycle of the unity of two, we get 2/4=0.5 So would we get the square of 1.5 by traveling only 90 degrees? Let us check. Since we only have the first 3 cycles on the picture above, now is the time to download the *Excel file attached (assuming you haven't drawn a 'cube of 9' yet yourself,) and we can check this theory. * I saved it in the Excel 2000 (xls) format as well, for those who might not have the Office7 or later version (xlsx). If there is a mess up, blame Microsoft, not me. So, since your Cube of Nine has just expanded from 2 cycles to a couple more than two, you can check easily if the squares of odd numbers fall in the grey squares on bottom left (315 degrees, remember, o degrees is left side of the 'cube' number 1 being the centre.) and Even numbers squared being one square to the left (counterclockwise) of the top right grey squares (135 degrees). Two examples. 717 squared = 514089 718 squared = 515524 For ease of navigation in the excel file, it is easiest (since there are quite a few numbers in there) to zoom out to max. then you can slide the scroll thumbs (I think it is called that) to +- the middle of the scroll bars. You then click on or near where you are looking, and when you zoom in, excel keeps focus on the selected cell. Alternatively (the easiest) is do a 'find' (Alt F) but you must choose 'find values' in the find options. Excell 7 has it in a dropdown titled 'look in' I can't recall what the other ones have it as, but it is there somewhere. For ease of finding, I used the two numbers that are the outside limits of this cube of 9. In other words look at top right corner and bottom left. Now, after all that, let us test that theory... 717.5 squared = 514806.25 So, from the bottom left corner (717^2 = 515524) we go up (clockwise as our value is higher than 17, the corresponding numbers must be higher than 514089. We travel 90 degrees. (to top left corner), and what do we find there? Surprise surprise, one square below the grey squares, we find 514806 717.25^2=514447.5625 (2 = 360 degrees, 1 = 180 degrees, 0.5 = 90 degrees, 0.25 = 45 degrees etcetera.) So travel down from top left (since 717.25 &lt; 717.5) 45 degrees and you end up on the 0 degree line and the number, one ccw (counter clockwise) from there is... You guessed it. 514447. The blue lines on the Cube are the next division. In other words 45 degrees/2 (22.5 degrees more or less than their neighbours.) which is 0.25/2 = 0.1225 You can keep on dividing the cube this way into infinity. If you draw a big enough cube, you can calculate squares and square roots to greater accuracy than our computers. Ok, the cube would probably span a couple of galaxies... How can you know which number is the square root? (Yes, I hear you thinking that). Easily, if you choose a number in the 315 degree line, 529 for example, and you count outwards from no.1 how many cycles around the square 529 is and include no.1 in the count, you get 12 cycles. Then, including no. 1, count the next 12 odd numbers in sequential order. You end on the number 23, which is the square root of 529. The same applies for even numbers. I think that is enough to chew on for a while.

Hello BlueMental, many topics at once ! I will go through the GGG thread again, but so far I had no really consistent trading results based on the MT4 version. I think that BEFORE applying the Gann Grid or anything like it ( Gann´s Angles ), we need to scale the charts, so that we have a 1x1 relationship. Thats at least what I am doing, and then if I apply the angles it just shows me the acceleration speed of price in a defined time period. Very difficult for those with a tight budget who really sincerely want to learn and only have MT4..... I have been reading on and off about cycles, like Lars von Thienen and the crowd at wave59 etc. So far I have not intensified my reading or subscribed to material abobe 2K ( my usual limit ).... ( as is often the case with Gann related literature, - see the Sacred Science website or the sheer cost of using something like wave59 or Market Analyst -it is VERY EXPENSIVE ). The only thing that worked for me in actual trade results so far - using non-conventional ideas - was Bemac`s ICCE version of Fibonacci, and the use of Angles in cheaper versions of software, like in TracknTrade or Ensign. I am open to any suggestions and thank you for taking the time to write, I will be following everything with great interest ! Michael

Found this Sq of 9 indicator somewhere in my dusty cupboard......plus your indicator if I am correct. Before I forget I would like to say something I have noticed this year. The " gurus " often advise newbies - and those more inclined to trade on higher timeframes - to take a top-down approach to trading. So lets say we plot a 20 ema and then first look at Monthly, then Weekly, and then Daily - therefore implicitly stating that higher timeframes are the cause or decisive factor for lower timerframes. It is then advised to ONLY enter when the higher timeframes signal a trend change.....etc. I noticed this year, that we had structural shifts in EURUSD, AUDUSD and USDJPY, that really shattered my belief in this approach. Why ? ( Example coming what I am trying to say )...... Thus, I went long in EURUSD very early, more or less in July, when a friend of mine who uses Bloomberg and saw the Spanish yield drop, plus Draghi`s statement " we will do whatever it takes " etc., told me : now all the institutions will go into EURUSD again. At that same time I happened to post a chart here in FF - and more than 1 knowledgeable trader / teacher, - always applying the above mentioned top-down approach -, told me to wait, " don`t waste your funds ", we wait until the Weekly confirms etc. That is to say, like in USDCHF way long ago, and this year in EURUSD, we had FUNDAMENTAL timing changes ( maybe now USDJPY multi-year change as well ). The classic top-down approach is then entering very late, and although I do see the merit because it prevents newbies from losing a lot of money, in my opinion a non-conventional trading method ( be it Gann applied 2.0, Cycles, Fib advanced like Robert Miner, Astro, Median Lines etc. ) should excel in offering a unique timing element , which lets the trader " see " that there is actually a REAL structural shift happening. He will then enter and make vast amounts of money, whereas the usual trader will constantly criticize this entry and say " don´t try to pick tops and bottoms ". I hope you understand what I am trying to say. Thanks. Michael

Most people use the Gann square of 9. Gann did have a cube of 9, but that is much less known. a cube of 9 is the square of 27.

I posted a few words on the Metaquotes Mql5 forum regarding the fundamental infrastructure flaw that flows through Mt4 and Mt5. That is the inconsistency of the definition of what the X-axis is. For some items it is time in seconds, for others it is barcount, yet for others it is a pixel x on the screen. The very fact that the Gann Angles, Gann Grids, and anything else that has the variable "scale" in it is limited to 2 decimal points, is just one tiny part of the problem. All the for/while loops use barcount that gets transposed to Time[x], while the 'scale' is related to minutes. On H4, under 1:1 scale, you can not even begin to see a fraction of the chart. There are Gothic towers going through the top of the clouds with no end in sight. This is due to the fact that they fail to accommodate that 1 H4 bar is actually 240 'Time units' so the true 1:1 of the H4 timeframe is actually 1:240 Not only that, there is only one way to actually get the proportional scale exact, and it is complicated. There is no scale ratio of __:__ offered where we can type in 1:240 or whatever. The only option we have is with the Max and Min per chart. So if we define Max as Y, and Min as Y-240 pips, then we are supposed to get an accurate 1:1 (I.E. 1:240) It does get close, but if you actually check a square (placed by co-ordinate and price with rectangle, or trendlines) then the 'square' is actually ever so slightly rectangular. This occurs primarily due to the rounding of numbers to 2 decimal points. Kind of like doing quantum physics with integers. They do not see this as an issue, because they are predominantly coders and secondarily traders. We are predominantly traders and secondary coders. We code if it can help us trade better, or if we can learn something by digging in the inner workings of something. They (Metaquotes Coders) can not come to an agreed upon conclusion of exactly what they wish to use as an X axis. The entire structural failiiure is actually quite easily solved. An extrapolation:- 1. Denote the unit of 1X = 1 minute 2. Do all loops in X of minutes 3. Use X as minutes for trendlines/grids etc. in any timeframe as minutes and allow the program to calculate the pixel placement of bars and lines in direct relation to minutes. (in other words, though a single H4 bar is 240 minutes, the pixelation is based on the X minutes of the first minute of those 240 minutes. 4. Offer a simple 'TimeToBarcount()' feature (much the same as DoubleToString and other conversion functions. Try mentioning to 'the powers that be' on Mql forums, and you will find that they do not want to hear that their system might have some issues. I tried in a nice way to make a suggestion, you can follow it here:- http://www.mql5.com/en/forum/9423 I tried in another way to offer something to the person whose arrogance is only exceeded by his ignorance with the following: http://www.mql5.com/en/forum/9454 I now have stopped wasting my time in their forums. Deaf by choice remain deaf. First of all, learn something of primary value, do not buy ANYTHING anymore. Dig a little deeper, find what you can that is free or shown/discussed at least in basic concepts. Realise and understand that there is no Genie/EA/Indicator/Program that can tell you when to buy or when to sell. Duh, if there was, then the financial institutions would not need any traders. They would all run on a laptop in the office while they spend time surfing in Hawaii. This in turn leads to the obvious conclusion that IF what is being offered works , (for $1000 plus) then why is the owner of that 'gem' selling it at all? They should (with the perfect trading system) have absolutely zero need for your $1k. If what they had DID allow them to double their money every month, do you really think they would tell you it existed? You can not learn anything if you follow. A 2 year old child gets told by her mother that she must not touch the bright flowing yellow and red pattern on the candle. Her mother tells her it will burn her, that she will get blisters. Intellectual descriptions of things that the 2 year old has no experience with which to compare. What is burn to someone who has not been burned? Only once that 2 year old child TOUCHES the flame, and GETS BURNED, does anything her mother told her convert from hypothesis to experiential knowledge. Good judgement comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgement. ( Quote from The Mechanic - Jason Statham) You mention 'many topics' :- I am a machine designer, manufacturer. To be that does not say what is involved with what it is. I started as a Fitter and Turner, then became a Tool and Die Maker, Then did Pneumatics and Hydraulics, then did Motor Electrical wiring and Switchwork. In Between all that I also became a coded welder and CAD designer. If I go to a site that has one of those lines that has 'intermittent faults', I walk through the plant. listen, I look, I touch a few places to feel for vibrations. This usually takes about 20 minutes. Then I tell them what is wrong in places A, B and C of their plant. I also show them where production 'bottlenecks' are in their system that cause delays or redundancy in their system. The callouses earned over the years is what gives one this 'magic insight'. Nothing else does it. No calculations or theory fits. Only those experiences of burned fingers (trashed Trading Accounts) give one the ability to 'feel' the problem and thus 'see' the solution. What is blatantly obvious to me, to others is inconceivable and seems to border on 'magic spells' or 'divine intervention. In truth, it is nothing more than lots of sweat equity and the choice (time and time again) of 'putting my money where my mouth is.' You will notice in the second link I gave above that you can see in the pictures a partial representation of the (not yet uploaded) Magic Moving Channel Indicator. I have not yet uploaded it (or shown pics) for one specific reason. That reason is because without you (the viewer) having at least part of the fundamental understanding of what I learned before designing the Indicator, it will be nothing more than an intellectual description of 'the flame will burn and give you blisters'. You need to have, under your belt, the conceptual understanding through experience and hard work, of why and how the indicator works. To understand the deeply intertwined connections that make it worth something. If, like phi.nut, who is not prepared to get his hands dirty and look deeper into a given situation, then all that is received from a new concept or mindset is derogatory and meaningless. Tolstoy rewrote 'War and Peace' nine times before he accepted it as worthy of publishing. Don Hall spent 30 years on the concept of Pyrapoint and searching a deeper understanding of Gann's methods. These were not thirty 'idle' years. For us to have any value, is to do our best to learn all we can, so that we can spend 20 minutes looking at a chart (as Gann did) and make 80% plus profitable trades that to those at large it seems 'magical' or 'by divine intervention'. Buying it will not get us there. Holding our hand in the flame will.

You ever been thrown in the deep end of the pool with no idea how to swim? &lt;EVIL GRIN&gt; BMILong__.mql (which is in the template) is here on this thread - at the top right of the thread you see a little 'attached symbol' with a number next to it, that gets you a window of all files attached in this thread, you can 'hide images' so you only have the mql files) The Magic Moving Channel indicators are the MAX mq4's They open standard with the Base MA_Mode set to 3 (SMMA) but in the template they are set to 1 (EMA) The reason why I called the template 'overload' will be blatantly obvious when you use it. Try not to get lost, on my mq4's (except for BMILong__) you can set the ALL_ON to false, which will leave them in the chart but they will be invisible. IMPORTANT the overload template was set to EURUSD Daily (a replica of Michaels picture) if you use it on any other currency or timeframe, it will just be a chaotic mess. (which it is anyway, but it is a well ordered chaotic mess on EurUsd D1) Enjoy the swimming.

Hello BlueMental, I can relate to a lot what you write because I come from a musician`s family and myself played piano and violin from age 6 to 27 for hours every day....so that relates to the difference between learning on a purely theoretical level as opposed to sweating it out and knowing then what works and what not. I`ll keep studying and I also would like to step back a bit - I sense that there is still a lot of foundation info necessary to absorb before we can get down to Q&amp;A. ============= Thank you for taking the time to post all this, I have become a bit desillusioned about FF in the recent 2 years ( another story ), and then come your posts out of the tunnel of the air ( yes, pun intended ), providing a much needed fresh perspective. Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas ! Michael

Here is some food for thought. IF and it is a big if, I ever tell you to trade, to wait, or anything like that, tell me to go to hell and to mind my own business. Now take that same statement and consider if it should be applied to anyone else that gives advice. I question things, I try to explain how and why I think/perceive what I do so that others can understand my meaning. In doing so (the explaining etc.) it helps me clarify in my own mind what my thoughts and 'systems' are and if there are any major weaknesses(which I did not see), it comes out in the story. I do not claim to have any answers, and usually what happens is that I cause those that discuss/interact with me to question things MORE not less. I received an offer for a trading system, I do not recall the details, you know how it goes, you get hundreds of them "Make $ 124 454 321 784.00 in 3 minutes starting with a $50 micro account", but this one was different. The guy stated that you can (using his system) make a reasonable profit if you are prepared to follow his system with diligent trading. I did not subscribe to his system, but I did read one interesting and useful piece of information. He stated the following (the general concept, not quoting). Many people try to trade to get huge wins, 300 pips, or 150 pips. but few people pay true attention to their win loss ratio. If I get 3 winning trades that averaged 300 pips, in other words 3 x 100 pips. Together with those wins, I get 5 losing trades averaging 60 pips, then 5 x 60 = 300. This is a break even (excluding costs and overheads). We as traders are more interested in the wins, rather than preventing the losses. If we have a good win/loss ratio, and we follow our rules diligently, we trade profitably. An example:- If we open trades hoping to win 100 pips, with a SL at 50 pips, this is a 2:1 ratio. If we hope to win 100 pips with a SL of 80 pips, this is a 10:8 ratio. So lets calculate. Using a fixed amount of Lots. We start with a 1:1 ratio (100 pips TP, 100 Pips SL) 1. Loses (-100) 2. Loses (-100) -200 3. Loses (-100) -300 4. Loses (-100) -400 5. Loses (-100) -500 6. Wins (+100) -400 7. Wins (+100) -300 8. Wins (+100) -200 9. Wins (+100) -100 10. Wins (+100) Break Even (meaning Loss after Spread/Commission removed) 5 Losses to 5 Wins = Break Even. Total risk of 10 x 100 = 1000 pips. Total possible Gain 10 x 100 = 1000 Pips Using 2:1 ratio (100 TP, 50 SL) 1. Loses (-50) 2. Loses (-50) -100 3. Loses (-50) -150 4. Loses (-50) -200 5 Loses (-50) -250 6. Loses (-50) -300 7. Wins (+100) -200 8. Wins (+100) -100 9 Wins (+100) Break Even 10 Wins (+100) +100 6 Losses to 4 Wins Leaves us 100 pips gained. Total risk of 10 x 50 = 500 pips. Total possible Gain 10 x 100 = 1000 Pips Using a REACHABLE ratio of 3:1 (36 TP, 12 SL) 1. Loses (-12) 2. Loses (-12) -24 3. Loses (-12) -36 4. Loses (-12) -48 5 Loses (-12) -60 6. Loses (-12) -72 7. Loses (-12) -84 8. Wins (+36) -48 9 Wins (+36) -12 10 Wins (+36) +24 7 Losses to 3 Wins leaves us 24 Pips ahead. Total risk of 10 x 12 = 120 pips. Total possible Gain 10 x 36 = 360 Pips If the 3:1 ratio was 150:50 the figure would be 100 (2/3rds of TP) As was with 2:1. Total risk would be of 10 x 50 = 500 pips. Total possible Gain 10 x 150 = 1500 Pips So, by being more 'fussy' and picking choice trades where we can run the 3:1 ratio successfully (and YES we can find em!), we only have to win 3 out of 10 to be profitable. Let us say that (being poor traders) we average 4 wins to 6 losses. With a 100:100 that leaves us -100 pips. With 100:50 that leaves us +100 pips With the 12:36 that leaves us with +60 pips if 150:50 it would be +250 pips I used the 12:36 because it is far easier to find trades that fit that range, Gann's trades (if you read up on it) were seldom in action for longer than 25 minutes. Quick in, quick out. Not greedy Saga's to gain 400 pips. This is what the trading system that was offered brought to my attention. Yes, we actually all already know this, but when the cards are down, how often do we follow it as a philosophy? LOL, right now I am in a long position (GbpJpy) that is 115 pips in the RED, and by the way the charts look, it is DEFINITELY going further south. It might be enough to trash (yet another) trading account. Why? Stubborn Greed. Because by looking at the charts subjectively earlier on this last Thursday when I was 22 Pips ahead, I found a possible (not highly likely, just possible) push upwards that will reach 70 pips instead of the 20 I had. When it turned South, I managed to con myself into the (but the main trend is going up strong) and I am reasonably sure that the price will (eventually) go up above my entry point. Is that good trading? Definitely NOT. So it seems to be true that I (just like everyone else) falls under the same Greedy for Big Moves fallacy, rather than picking better situations with low to almost zero risk for small gain. I (like many) find it difficult to NOT trade. It is interesting and exiting when we are trading. It is boring waiting for that nice situation. If however I want to actually trade profitably, I have to force myself (as the dude said) to diligently follow my rules. So Michael, what I am trying to say here is that we (all of us) know that if we are just a little bit prudent with our trading, and we do some basic Money Management, we most definitely CAN make more than 3 wins to 7 losses in the 36:12 pip range! Rather than follow the Guru's that want to 'wait for the weekly trend'. For crying in a bucket, 3 wins to 7 losses! A 2 year old can do better than that! Just with Magic Monster Alone that is achievable. The Magic Moving Channel helps a lot, but I discovered (which is why the Fib Arcs are in the Overloaded TP) a clearer Better FREE tool that shows change points even more clearly than my long worked out methos we are trying to go through. Check out this site:- http://www.gunner24.com/lp/gold-2c-box.html It is Freeware, yes it does work. After you download it, download the Trading Manual as well.

I was thinking of ways of utilising the numbers/angles etc. in a 3d fashion, as opposed to using the square to get 'vertical' (price) numbers to 'horizontal' Time. Can you share with us what you know of the cube?

I worked very hard to get my IQ up to 7 I must say! If I had one more brain cell, it would be lonely. But at least it is overqualified to be a politician. I think I found the same hypercube thingy you speak of. It is an incredible looking thing, and I have no doubt that if one were able to study it long enough and find some way of using it mathematically, it would be able to show patterns we have not yet perceived. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-cube ) But alas poor Yorick... I am not Mandelbrot by a LONG stretch (in fact mathematically I am very weak) so I doubt I can get anything useful out of it. The reason, by the way, that I mentioned Yorick, is because he is of the same 'era' as Socrates, who died of Hemlock poisoning. The reason he was poisoned, was because he had the audacity of teaching the peasants what he knew! Pythagoras (who also had this crazy idea that people (yes, he thought of the peasants as people) are entitled to know and share knowledge. That in turn was why Pythagoras took exile in Egypt for 22 years. It was in his visit (aka political asylum, aka exile from the head hunters) that he discovered the 'Egyptian Calendar' which is either the Square of Nine or based on S9. This same Square of Nine, was used to calculate the exact measurements of the pyramids that were built 2000 years prior to Pythagoras' visit. In essence, just about everything Pythagoras 'discovered' was taught to him by the Egyptians. The Pyramid of Giza, just by the way, follows Fib numbers precisely... Fibonacci was born in 1170. Pythagoras was born 570 BC The Pyramids were built 2500BC. Just as Fibonacci (famous for the Fib Numbers) 'discovered' or 'invented' the Fib Numbers and Phi/phi. Not only that, he 'invented' the number zero. In truth, he was taught this knowledge by the Indians (Eastern, aka Asia, not America). The Roman Empire had no Zero, and their Math was very 'rural'. In a roundabout way, Fibonacci (with the number zero) marked the end of the Roman Empire.

I don't know about a 3D use of the cube of 9, just that the cube of 9 is the same as the square of 27. Another person studying Gann's work thinks that the cube of 9 may refer to the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars which happens every 27 months. A cycle of 27 times 27 months is 729, which is the cube of 9. 9x9x9

--- 帖子 #196 ---
The Great Pyramid (The Pyramid of Giza) is a 4d physical representation of the square of 9 (if viewed from the top down). So it is actually a 'cuve' of nine, as opposed to the 2d drawing of the square of nine. In truth, the pyramid is actually a representation of a sphere, and it and the 'satellite' pyramids is a physical layout (or was when it was built) of The Stars that make up Orion's Belt. The pyramid itself (in spherical form) represents the biggest star of the Orion's Belt. Since it is also a physical 3d version of the square of nine, translated into 3d. Perhaps it is more correct to say that the 2d square of nine is a translation, or simplification of the Cube of Nine. I am absolutely certain that the 3rd dimension added to the Square of Nine has further value. The problem is that I have no idea (yet) how to access this added Math Map, for lack of better words. I have a sneaking suspicion that by utilising the 3rd dimension, allows access to mapping, traveling or capturing energy from further dimensions. Only now (it is just starting at the moment) are our scientists finally accepting the fact that 60% plus of our scientific theory is false. One of the 'major' ones is the truth that the 2nd law of Thermodynamics is null and void. Something else to consider. The pyramid was originally covered with a smooth polished flat and angled limestone surface. A great earthquake damaged that surface (I do not recall exactly when, but it was +- 1400), and the Egyptian King (or whatever the correct title is) collected the fallen limestone and used it to build other religious buildings where the limestone can still be seen today. Why I bring this up, is to bring attention to the fact that the Pyramid was not repaired. The craftsmen who built it and the skill level involved was no longer 'available'. It is doubtful that all the craftsmen died and their combined knowledge was not passed on to their children. So, what are the remaining possibilities? Perhaps they moved elsewhere. Another planet... or perhaps another dimension. Just some food for thought.

Hi Blue I know what the Sq of 9 look like, a sq block with the numbers in it that goes in a spiral but I don't know how to use it. The first time I saw someone use Gann Squaring, Cycles and Geometry was from a guy here at FF named JR97 and on his blog he shows you how to draw Gann square manually. but I never really got my head around all this gann 'stuff'. example: not sure if I draw it correct... but it looks good Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Hansie. Yes, That is what it should look like. Those red lines I drew where the chart ends are possible paths the price will go. The trick is not in the predicting, it is in the knowing where the channels are, so that if the price changes to a new channel, you know that it usually goes at least to the bottom, or through the bottom of the resistance/support above or below it. The Magic Moving Channels form as the price moves on, and if you load the 2 of them on a new chart, you will see it better. Also load the BothMac (the chart one). If you do not know how the prices bounce off BothMac (together they are The Magic MacD Monster) then read through this thread from the beginning. They are also support and resistance levels. &lt;edit&gt; Just a thought about the pictures, the forum have to store all those pics and we have to download them, so it is best to try keep them 'small'. The best way to do this is convert them to .png files They are the most efficient pic/zip type of picture format. You lose almost zero quality but chop a 100Kb file down to 30Kb. I use ImageShack, which also compresses the pics further. You can choose the setting when you upload the pics, I choose the 'forum' setting. Lastly, only upload 1 pic if 1 is enough to show what you mean, and only upload pics if they are needed. Remember, if this section of the forum has 15 pictures of 100Kb each, that means every time a new post is made, our browser reloads the page. For some dumb reason, Firefox (and probably the others as well) do not keep these pics properly in a cache, so those 15 pics = 1.5 Megs of data. Reloaded 30 or 40 times... you get the picture &lt;/edit&gt; The other 'new' stuff in the chart is the Fib Arcs. For them to be correct, their scale has to be set right. If your broker has 4 digits instead of 5, then the scale is different. For you to check if it is correct, right click on an open area of the chart and choose properties, if there is too much on the chart (like thee is in 'overload' it sometimes only lets you get the lines or EMA properties, if that happens press F8, which will give you chart properties) then in the 'common' tab, you choose 'Scale in One to One'. zoom out to max and check if the Arcs look like half of a circle. If they look like an ellipse, the scale is wrong. If they are wrong, you need to change the scale in the FibArcs. I'm not sure what the scale is for a 4 digit broker, but I know that it is a multiple of 10. With the 5 digit it is 10, so it might be 0.1 1 100 or 1000 (just try em all until it is right.) Once you know you have the thing (and are sure yourself) in the right scale, for now just study everything you can see. Use your own ideas and see what the chart shows you, and try to see which way you think the price might go and why. (It looks like the scale is correct in your pic, but one of the great things with Mt4 is that a loaded scale based drawing usually follows what it was saved from, but if you change timeframes, it might NOT keep the same scale. Just for you to figure it out a bit deeper, draw an ellipse on your chart (a new chart) and also draw a new FibArc (your FibArcs get the properties of the last one you opened to change properties. If you did not open any of the templates FibArcs, you get the 'default' fibArc settings) It doesn't matter in this case. Why I suggest you draw the ellipse and the FibArc is for you to see that to get your ellipse (with the 2 prices set to the same value and the DateTime setting the width) the scale for the ellipse needs to be 0.1 NOT 10 like the FibArc. Mt4 can't figure out a standard way of keeping scale. Important :- if the scale is wrong, the FibArcs do not show ANY lines of resistance or support. Like the old saying about carpentry, Measure twice, cut once.

Cool, so now you have seen the Pyrapoint in action. The important part that the Pyrapoint tool does, which the GannGrid does not (unless you know about it) is that specific 'angles' (Gann Angles which are actually a ratio (in GannGrid it is called scale)) in Pyrapoint, they are actually angles, and they are all related to 360, halved and halved again. In other words:- 360/2 = 180 180/2 = 90 90/2 = 45 45/2 =22.5 22.5 /2 = 11.25 and so on. The other thing that Pyrapoint does is it sets the time width of the Grid. By using the Square Root of the price, and by checking which angle it is closest to then using the square of that number, gives you the WHEN that the time will be when it hits the next price. To do this with GannGrid, you need to calculate it all and set your GannGrid accordingly. I choose a different way of setting my GannGrid though. That (and Pyrapoint) is another story, for now, just check out whatever you can see from all you have. Do a Google search for "Pyrapoint Don Hall PDF" and read his book about Pyrapoint. It can be a bit confusing in some parts, but you will figure it out.

Sabrina my dear, you have it all wrong, I might (if I am lucky and get upgraded enough) one day become a peasant. For now, I am not yet in that high a class range. You as a woman have an advantage that men do not have. Even though 90% or more of all involved with trading are male (you know the old story), they (we men) lack the insight that women have. That female 'magic' that knows that this colour works well with that one and that = fashion. Where men (except for the gay community) have zero of that insight. To us, it is like explaining colour to a blind man. I try my best to see how she moves and what her moods are, you have a clear advantage on the men. Use it!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
BlueMental my friend, maybe you miss the inverted commas that i put when i wrote Peasants, the meaning is not what you understand ... i have a good friend that is a peasant, she lives in a beautiful place and does a beautiful work ... she is more lucky than me ... It is wonderful that you think that there is something magic in female .. (Often when i try to explain to my husband That the color of his tie is orrible i really think to speak with a blind man ... ) And that this can be useful in trading ..i always thought i would be much more logical in my trading approach, but maybe i was wrong...

Hi my dear Friend BlueMental.. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.. sorry for my English it's not my native language Thank You for your Beautiful BMI Long Indicator, she enriched my trading method.. but please forgive me that I make some modification so she can match with my method that actually base on EMA 72.. hopefully you don't mind about that.. As a day trader, I only use it in EU pair with H1 as direction finder and M15 as entry.. and it's work for me I also love round number and it's quarter theory.. bellow I attach my BMI modification and template that I use, maybe you hv time to checked it out.. once again thanks to you and best regards T Kiads

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Kiads. Merry Christmas to you too. Your English is great. I know I can not speak your language and you do well speaking (and writing mine). You do not need to ask permission or forgiveness for changing the indicator. If it works for you, or if you can find a way to make it netter for everyone then please do. Did you notice that the yellow (before you changed colour) is a better version of the OsMA indicator. Load up OsmA at the same settings as you have for BMI Long and check how many pips before OsMA it crosses over. In this picture, BmiLong crosses 10 Bars before OsMA in front and 13 Bars before OsMA at the end. Take a look at the program of BMI Long (it is called 'lomg' because it is set for long time setting) This indicator is axtually the MacD Magic Monster, but the 'BothMac' EMA's are ALSO the MacD Magic Monster because they are the same. I use the EMA's because I do not have to check the trend each time. Did you read the first 3 or 4 posts of this thread?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Yes Sir, exactly.. . of course if I put back your default setting it is still our beloved BMI Long. I just add BBonArray on her so i can 'see' more early according to my 72 HL Ema BB to find out correction wave like this picture bellow (between vertical yellow line) and I believe that 72 and 75 is not so difference in result.. Wish you all the best. thank you T_Kiads

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi Kiads, The numbers are not too important, the way BMI Long is written is very similar to most MacD's, but there are some math 'twists' in there that give the zero lag. &lt;edit&gt; Actually it is not a zero lag MacD, it is the twists that give the more well defined zero lag 'OsMA, that is not an OsMA. &lt;/edit&gt; The indicator will work fine no matter what settings you use, BUT the reason why I set her with those numbers, is because they follow a ratio of one number to the other. This can best be seen if you place the BMI_Long on the chart (Download BothMac). What that ration gives you is the price bounces off the EMA's (and no, the EMA's are not 75,365 and 60). Not only does the price list bounce of the EMA's, but the EMA's bounce off the other EMA's, which gives you a better 'more clear' indication that 'yes this is a reversal, not a false one'. If you know how to use it, it becomes an even more powerful indicator. If you set it to 12,26,9 it would work fine as well. My point is knowing which EMA's to set up to use WITH it. BMI_Long is only part of the all. The true power is more visible and easier to 'see' in BothMac. Now this new indicator, Magic Moving Channels, used together with BothMac and Fib Circles is so precise as to WHEN to enter a trade, how many pips you can expect, and if it goes the wrong way, you know quickly and lose minimum pips. So far, the only person who has shown and taken action towards learning how to see what I see is Hansie. He has looked in to pyrapoint and shows he is interested in looking deeper. Others are interested, but they have not (at least not visibly) started taking steps toward learning how to use the indicators. Having these indicators is all good and well, but if you do not know how to use them to their very best, then they offer only a fraction of what the can show you. Roosevelt was once asked, "If you have only 4 hours to chop down an oak tree, what will you do?", He replied, " I will spend the first three hours sharpening my axe."

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Ok Peeps, here are the 'Updated' 3 Max Charts. And added are 3 Max Histo Charts. They should begin to make what Magic Moving Channels gives us, This picture below is a zoomed out H1 GbpJpy. I placed the BMI_Long beneath it. Notice a resemblance between the two? But BMI_Long doesn't have the channels. BMI Long has (LOL) become redundant and is on his way to the glue factory. Notice I scaled the chart so you can see the top and bottom of Max. Look at the histo's that are overlaid above Max. http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/6...mcoverview.png What do you see? What does this tell us, and what can you find useful in these indicators. Tell me your ideas and then I will tell you mine. Yes, I know you can not see anything clearly on the picture, download the indicators and place all 6 on one chart. Look at it. Zoom in, zoom out, EXPLORE them. Draw trend lines or circles or little furry monsters with machine guns if that makes you happy. Do whatever you can to extract any and all info out of them, then let me know what you can see that is usable in there for trading better.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
So, correct me if I am wrong, you are using the BB in the BMI_Long sub-windows to show where the (now blue) 'OsMA' Line crosses the Bands. This looks useful, but I fear there is a problem if you are doing it that way. BMI_Long is scaled 'to fit', and so too is the Bands indicator. Depending on how zoomed in you are and what the numbers are of both BMI_Long and BB, you will find that as you scroll backwards and forwards, that the 'scale' changes, so too do the crossover points between BMI_Long and BB. If you are seeing something else in another way that I am not seeing and you are NOT using it the way I stated, then please share your idea with us so we can understand it more. Thanks.

Hi BlueMental , I tried to read as much as possible in ur thread which is really interesting , and it is sooo clear that you spent lots of effort about finding the details of the usage. All of these indicators , calculations , thoughts ...instead of keeping them for urself you just shared them here ... That's sooo respect-worth... Although I do not like indicators on my charts , I downloaded them one by one and tried them on my chart , and the 75,365,60 adjustments are quite effective... Thank you very much for sharing your ideas...Take care

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi again, actually I know about 'fit in' matter when I learn your BMI_Long script code and for me there's no problem at all because my main method still my 72 HL EMA on main chart. There are 3 options to play with BB on BMI, put BB at 'OsMA' line, or at 'MACD" line or both OsMA and MACD line that will give us 'Bands' of phantom line of median between OsMA and MACD line. I 'played' BB for several years so I working with this 'deviation' matter alot. According to my template for EU H1-M15 the combination between 72 EMA HL BB in main chart and BMI_Long 'semi' oscillating in subwindow with BB put at 'OsMA' line will help me in 'trend-less/ranging' situation like the example picture bellow. (picture 1) 'You know' about 'squeeze and expand' matter at BB right ? so when BB on BMI became 'squeeze' and we know 'where is' the price in 72 EMA HLBB channel in main chart mostly we may 'know' the direction of the next 'expand' especially when price 'trapped' in the middle of 72 EMA HLBB channel (sideways).. And.. by 'switching' BB from 'OsMA' to 'MACD' line we will 'see' further the 'almost sure thing' (I marked with circle at picture 2).. I Hope I am not doing 'wrong' interpretation about this, I am still work it out like today (picture 3). best regards T_Kiads

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Another discussion about ' price direction angle' like in pyrapoint, i never trust MT4 'scale' ..LOL. this the worst charting package in relation with 'accuracy' maybe 'they' intended to do that.. hahahaha. I believe they could do better if they want to do it. but once you know how to play with 'angle' then you move one step further from 'predicting' to 'projecting'. Even if you do the 'fixed' size one to one option in MT4, to make that fib arc 'look-like' perfect circle it is still make only 'price' axis to the real size but not the 'time' axis (the width of the standard candle), so 'what you see' is still depend on 'what your screen resolution' matter. I do learn that 'geometrical charting' too and I prefer to use 'price base chart' instead of ' standard time base chart'.. hope it help..

--- 帖子 #215 ---
OK, Sorry, I did not see when I looked the fiirst time that you had added the BB to BMI_Long. That means it does not deviate at all. I like your code, nice work. Yes this is great stuff. It is low risk high reward with high % chance of successful trade, 'almost sure thing' as you call it. I am going to explore it more now that I put the template and indicators in. One 'certain' trade that makes profit is better than 1000 'maybe' trades. I like.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
LOL, talking about scale and Mt4 they limit the Grids, ellipses and Gann Lines to 2 decimal points. They might as well have used integers for accuracy. Not only that, the x-axis is in minutes for charts, but for coding it is in BarCount. The 'scale' changes depending on your timeframe. FibArcs remain constant if you change the scale. Ellipses use a totally different 'scale' ratio to FibArcs. If a FibArc is correct with scale set on 10, the ellipse has to be set to 0.1 to be the same. But to get FibArcs to line up the same on different timeframes, you need to use the minutes per bar as scale. Yes, it is worse than a nightmare trying to use scale with Mt4. take a look here:= http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...40#post6325340 Where I was showing (with a live trade in progress) selym_co a trading strategy that usually ropes in the pips. I lost track of exactly what and where I was and used the wrong scale.... I give you two guesses what happened. mt5 is even worse. They tried so hard to make mq5 into c++ that they missed the boat completely. To think (like windows API) you need a handle, and to do anything with mq5, you need a few hundred pages of code to do what you can with mq4 with 1 line. The system often drags if using mt5 and the memory seldom gets freed so you have to reboot every hour or 2 just to have a happy running OS. None of this really matters, IF you know about it. I actually want to get together with other coders to create a better trading platform. I find it ridiculous that the whole trading 'fraternity' can not use simple words like 'Close Position' instead they have to Buy a sell, and short to a selling position. If you have and open short position, you have to cover it. What is wrong with hit the 'close' button and it sends the correct signal (buy if sell open else sell if buy open). The other thing that is the biggest problem of them all is the x-axis. Simple solution, 1x = 1 minute and the visual (pixel x-axis) = 1x * bars per minute. So regardless of what the time frame is, squares remain squares and circles are circles. When you try to tell (write a suggestion on Mq5 or Mq4 Forum) that their program is not perfect, they think you are the fool! As far as the scale issue is concerned, I will write an 'indicator' that you move a line, put it at high or low, or wherever, and the indicator draws the FibArcs with the right setting for the the timeframe. I just haven't got around to it yet. The 'circle' does not have to LOOK like a circle, it has to be a mathematically correct circle in relation to the chart data. Same with angles or Gann Angles (ratios). The only thing that does NOT change from scale stretch or timeframe change, are the basic trend lines. But that is only true if you set them at first in M1. (The minutes get rounded off (as with everything else in Mq4) in the higher timeframes.)

Hi my friend BlueMental, once again thank you, and I will continue explore this too.. regarding today example on EU. maybe you can checked it out at M15 TF for the detail. Use my template and 'switch the BB on BMI to 'MACD Line' (BBonSignal:false, BBon MACDline:true). Maybe you can 'see' early pattern of this stepped BB when it 'squeeze' in relating with 'OsMA' crossing zero line. actually this is 'repeated' pattern for several times. In the picture bellow, when BB 'squeeze' (yellow box), and follow up by 'OsMA' cross zero line (in this case to negative territory ( pink box) , price will 'move' with big momentum, then it will 'rest' for a while (consolidating at aqua box) then will be continue until 'OsMA' create 'pattern' like inside the lime box (in subwindow) or price 'cross' my stepped lower band at main chart. hope it help

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Thanks God, she work as expected.. LOL

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Switching 'side' to 'buyer' and already 'secured' my position since after 'OsMA' cross up 'MACD' sooner or later 'OsMA' will cross or bounce at zero line (white box sub windows) and also price will 'met' EMA72 HL at main chart (also white box).. hope it work

--- 帖子 #220 ---
"Touch down"... eh or should I say 'touch up'... LOL..

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I must say I have looked over this again and again and it is hard for me to get much from it at this point but I will keep looking and drawing cool stuff on the charts!

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I am interested in your setups. I was looking for a sell on the eu 60 min at the time of your 3rd chart and would like to know the steps you take for entry. Thanks

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi Gbryant20, nice to see you here... for original BMI_Long from BlueMental as example in GBPJPY H1, according to my personal understanding, the most simple thing is to see 'confluence' between 'OsMA' line and 'MACD' line when they both in same direction then it is your position direction. I give you example at this picture bellow. Yellow vertical line mean preparation (watching movement), Lime vertical line mean your entry position according to 'OsMA' and 'MACD' direction, and Red vertical line mean your exit. Of course similar to 'other' oscillator indicator there will be alot of divergence especially in 'OsMA' but if you can 'see' it with right point of view, divergence is also early warning signal. you can also notice the Blue vertical line that indicate quite early about 'changing' trend direction... Hope it help. Attached Image (click to enlarge) First, according to my template, In EU H1, I 'see' squeeze phase of BB that applied to MACD line in BMI, that is 'early' sign of next big movement. and also in the main chart price already near upper stepped HLBB and their candle configuration showing us that upside momentum already exhausted.. so the high of H1 candles look so hard to 'touch' upper stepped HLBB. then I switch down to M15 TF to look more detail and in M15 we can see more clearly that price move in sideways and 'trapped' inside middle HLBB line and in subwindows, BB also 'squeeze' at zero line. actually, before I take my sell (as example at 3rd picture in my example couple post before) , I open Buy position just for small pip profit, because 'OsMA' pointing Up after crossing zero line, and when I realize that M15 candles also difficult to 'touch' upper stepped HLBB in the main chart, I Close my buy position, and switch to sell position with the risk as close as upper stepped HLBB (not put the hard SL there but mental SL that if price move up, I will cut my sell position there). After that, when 'OsMA' actually crossing down the zero line I am 'in the money' ... LOL... Hope it helps... thanks n best regards..

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thank you for explaining the setup! I get it a little more now and I am sure I will more and more as time goes by. I do not understand the (red line) exit signals you show in the chart but that might have been something I missed along the way so I will go back through the thread and look. Thank you for time. Happy New Year to everyone!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
The Red vertical line is simply when 'OsMA' turn in opposite direction from 'MACD' line. This is the basic, but of course there's a lot another thing to 'watch' not just as simple as that... LOL.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hi, All.. Happy Healthy and Wealthy New Year 2013.. I made some cosmetic adjustment to beloved Indicator ! T-Kiads BMI Long Mod v01 I add stochastic filter to coloring MACD Histogram and also sometimes it is very difficult to 'see' the direction of each line when they merged together near zero line so I added text legend and text of last direction of each lines The Histogram also hv auto zoom function that can adapt your chart zoom selection in the next tick. or in weekend just switch TF back n forth to refresh the size of histogram (MACD Histo). Also I added more flexible parameters entry to adjust her in the way you like. here is the updated Hope it help Best Regards

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I also received some PM's that ask me how to 'look' at my template.. I want to explain that once again, of course by asking permission from my friend BlueMental since this is His thread, and at first I just want to show how thank you I am with this very useful BMI_Long Indicator for my trading method. Ok I want to take example from AUDUSD H1 and later M15. for the main chart first, For AUDUSD you must adjust my indicator ! T_Kiads_SweetSpot v01 and change the parameter : StartPrice from 1.3 to 0.9 because 1.3 is for EURUSD. In Picture 01. AUDUSD H1, you will see 'clearly' there was 3 stages of market movements, ranging period , downtrend, and at this moment another ranging period. I marked ranging period with blue rectangle consist of 2 block SweetSpot line. Maybe you can 'see' that the middle line of this 2 block of price in ranging market period of AUDUSD always become the 'swing point'. and you can also notice that 'one of the sign' of ranging market period is several candles 'trapped' inside double middle line of EMA 72 HL BB, when in trending market (downtrend) in between this 2 ranging periods, there is no candle 'touch' this double middle lines, and if there is one, then it will become 'high probability' entry point if confluence with other signs. This time, We will not talking about subwindow BMI, this is just overview of the main chart, so lets continue.. About that stepped double upper/lower line of HLBB you will notice that the step is always 10 pips/point and this both upper/lower line 'act' as dynamic S/R line. and sometimes will give you a 'clue' where the price will go. Just same as standard bollinger band but more 'clearly' in the way 'where' they can break or bounce. In Picture 02. we will focus on the last ranging market until today. I put bold horizontal lines (light salmon color) near every stepped Upper/Lower line of HLBB so, you can see how price 'react' with this lines. In this picture you can see that all bearish candles that enter the double lower HLBB area or just 'touch it' and create bottom wick/shadow and immediately follows by bullish candles was become 'nice spot' to entry buy position. At the other side, there is only one bullish candle that enter double upper HLBB area create top wick/shadow and immediately follows by bearish candle (today morning), that become 'nice spot' for entry sell position. You can explore history for any ranging market situation like this, and try to 'match' with sign from subwindows BMI with basic principle 'same direction between OsMA and MACD' and there was a 'squeeze' in upper/lower BB of MACD line and also the color of MACD histo. Put vertical line on it and try to switch to M15 for better detail to pin point your entry. Let say try to search for one month until today, and calculate the probability of win and loss ratio. Ok my dear friends, I will continue to explained next time.. eh next year maybe.. lol God Bless You All. Best Regard.

G'day guys and Happy New Year to All! I have been reading this thread for a while now on account of my ongoing love affair with the MacD I just wanted to drop a line to tell BlueMental and the rest of the contributors here how much I enjoy the thinking that this thread has produced. At the moment I am only able to digest the simplest of the concepts and charts. I have been exposed to Gann before but only so much as time counts and the basics of the square of 9. I find a more mechanical approach to trading better for myself personally because when my cold hard cash is on the line my stressed brain can only focus on 1 or 2 things at the most at one time and more complicated analysis just filled my mind with doubt and indecision and end result is more stress and bad outcomes as a result lol. I don't have any meaningful theory to bring to the forum but when I do I won't hesitate to share. I was wondering if Mr Kiads could provide some more information on his approach to this trading. I understand the need to match the MacD and the OsMa up in the same direction but I wanted to know how the Bollinger Bands fitted in and any other finer points if you don't mind explaining. Many thanks in advance and keep up the great work everyone! John

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Mr Kiads, You beat my post you magnificent man! Thanks for some further explanation. It is much appreciated. I'll have a good look at your explanations and let you know if I need any more clarification. Now I guess we just wait and see whether the US falls off a cliff or not. It's a shame it has gotten this close to the deadline but I guess miracles do happen.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
For the fiscal cliff I believe there will be partially deal as usual for the 'shake' of political 'face-lift' on both side ..lol. I think all major pairs will be 'in range' mode until next week excluding Yen pairs..

Little late buy entry in EU M15... when signal already there before.. well, better late profit than early loss .. lol.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Maybe I should believe the phrase: "Everything that came from numbers can be re-calculate by numbers" Previous OsMA swing point may predict next bouncing area of price movement, I still explore it Maybe this is only coincident in both EU and AU M15 who knows..lol.

Greetings Mate. The Gann Stuff floating around on the web is mostly Rubbish. Rubish that is being sold for ludicrous sums of money (If it was so effective, why would they need to sell it for $xxxx?) Most of what you read and learn about Gann just confuses you more than anything else. In truth, no one but Gann knows what Ganns Trading System was, and since he is no longer breathing on this realm, I doubt we can find a way for him to tell us. BUT, and this is a big but. I introduced Gann (Pyrapoint, Gunner24, Gann Grids and FibArcs) because once you understand in a bit of depth the time/price relationship relating to Gann and Fib concepts. You will (I promise) go through a paradigm shift of WHAT you see on the charts that will be fully visible till your dying breath WITHOUT a single Gann Grid or FibArc (or any other indicator at all) on your chart. But to get there, you need to absorb a fair amount of detail. I can finally say (after many years of panic trading) that I enter trades with a calm certainty that I had no chance of doing before. I am able to see the very instant I should abandon an existing trade, or if I should open a new position. Before it was a hit and miss affair. I sometimes got it right, but often I got it wrong. With regards to your 'don't have meaningful theory to bring', what my aim is in bringing the Gann Fib stuff into this thread is twofold. 1. I want (with any and all interested) to get this system into a fully functioning live trading method from top to bottom. Money Management, What to observe for entry/exit points, how much to expect as TP and also SL in any situation. In other words I want to get away from theory into something useful and usable. 2. By explaining what I have found/discovered/squeezed out of stones to other people, clarifies it in my own mind and helps me learn more. It also allows me to see what I do NOT know or see (my blind spots) through criticism of the readers. Other viewpoints, like Kiads modified bmiLong bring different viewpoints to look at. They might not suit everyones style, but that is not the point. If anything that anyone posts or brings can assist someone else, then great. There is no 'right' way because we are all different. I have delved quite deeply into Bolinger Bands and Keltner Channels in the past, and to me they are not 'reliable' enough. Kiads different way of using them got my attention, and I did explore further, but that style is not for me. That is not saying Kiads way is wrong. It is simply saying it is not my way. So please share how you have used any of the indicators from this thread OR any other indicators at all that you have found useful. The how and what you do that works, and if you do something but it does not work, let us know. Perhaps we can figure out together what went wrong, or what your blind spots are. There is no such thing as useful theory. All theory is nothing more than theory. Practicality is useful.

Numbers are symbols, a way we use to try to describe or 'speak' about the reality beneath the symbols. It is the closest language we have to source. Spoken word is more like Visual Basics. As far as different pairs showing similarities, I wrote indicators exploring that ages ago. Trying to find which pair is 'leading' and which are following. In the end, I found no way of getting a clear 'edge' so I dropped it. But those 'coincidences' happen a lot and often, but how to use them is a different story. I am sure you are familiar with Ichimoku. I explored using Ichimoku based 'MAs' and Ichimoku Based BB's. In other words I calculated the MA's the same way Ichimoku does. It has some interesting things, but I found no clear way that gave me any advantage. Check out these two indicators, you might find them useful or you might find a way to modify them to be more useful. You code much better than I do, so excuse the 'mess'.

Yes Sir, thank You my friend BlueMental... I do familiar with Ichimoku, my Japanese mentor teach me about it and the 'key point' of Ichi was use it with price base chart like 'renko' or 'kagi' chart not with time base chart like standard candlestick chart... With price base chart it will show not only 'range' but also 'angle'. I will explore your ichi indicators maybe i can learn more from them.. once again thank you so much.. I also learn all that Gann stuff and geometrical charting, I do hv Gunner24 since its early release.. lol. but still not convenience with that overlay option so i dropped it, but I catch the concept a little bit.. In my country I hv a group which focus on price movement angle and build a system called FACT (Fibonacci Arch Contrarian Triangle) implemented on price base chart. here is the example

--- 帖子 #236 ---
A nice catch of Grumpy Granny. +100 and still rising, but I only caught the first 30 pips. (I had to go out so I set TP not expecting more. But 30 pips is cool, 30 more than I had . If I stayed in the trade,I entered using Magic MagicMonster and FibArcs @ 139.004, I would have been at +128 Pips at the top Yellow Line on the picture below. If still open, it would be, now as I type be 158 Pips @ 140.49 I missed my New Years Bonus (Well most of it anyway.) Kiads, did you catch this one? Do yourself a favour, check how many pips EurUsd went with same spike. (38 pips). You can now see why I only trade GbpJpy. http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/5...ym5100pips.png

Wow.. great my friend BlueMental. I don't trade GBPJPY lately, since I still hv 1 open buy since Dec 11 so, I just keep it 'alive' ..lol. btw if you use my round number indicator ! T_Kiads SweetSpot for GBPJPY, just try to change the starting price to 139 and see it at H1 and zoom it out you will see the GBPJPY 'price block' and why she jump today and stop right there... hope it help.. my friend

With Mt4 You can not make a 'true' Renko, but it works well enough. I found the Kagi indicators for mt4 to not be good for me. I think becauuse I do not know the right way to use them. I wrote some 'self adjusting; Renkp indicators. So that the 'scale' they use fits with how many bars on the screen. It helps quite a lot. I remember that I did make quite a few good trades using renko only. (looking for head and shoulders patterns, or trend breaks etc.) To be honest, the way the Candlesticks are drawn is not as useful as Renko. Time limits per bar messes up a lot of things in some ways but shows other things that can not be seen with Renko. With the Gunner24, the only wayto use it well with mt4 is by understanding the idea behind it, then use FibArcs set to Period() In other words on M5 I use 5 scale, on H4 I use 240 scale. You can set the FibArc levels to 1;1.5;2;2.5... and get good rexults, or you can set it to the same placing as Gunner24. They do not look like 'circles' on mt4 but the price does follow them just like described in Gunner24. If you use any other scale, it does not work. I also like to use 1; 1.414;1.732;2.236;2.828... (Square Root of the Fib Numbers) I will look at the FACT and see if I can get anything useful out of it. Thank You.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Yes, Indeed my friend. what they 'called' standard renko builder program in MT4 hv a lot bug. So I made my own renko builder too. If you notice in my FACT example the 'renko block' just shifting half to replicate right 'angle' and also to make it 'true' renko we must create 'anchor point' so the renko program will always 'slicing' the price range in right position in every next tick. In that way, it will help so much to feeding data for other indicator that attached to this chart especially 'averaging type' indicators..

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Kiads, The indicators do not work with the 'steps' on GbpJpy. This is because it is 138.123 not 1.38123 I tried to see if I could change it in settings, but I can not, and since they are ex4 files I can not get in to change in code. EurEsd http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/819...lateeurusd.png GbpJpy http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/6...lategbpjpy.png They are normal BB on GbpJpy, not with the 'squeezedown' or squeeze up' that can be used in EurUsd

Hi my friend, for any Yen pairs.. for indicator ! T_Kiads BMI Long Mod v01 find parameter : BBprecision and change it to 1 for indicator ! T_Kiads_BBAnds v01 find parameter : BandsPrecision and also change it to 1 hope it help.

I do not think my renko indicator is close to a 'true' renko and it runs in a sub window . I do not really know any of the 'right' ways of using renko. That picture you showed me is the first method I have seen. I just used renko with experimenting and a bit of common sense. I stopped using it because I could not find any 'clear' way of finding reversals. Yes I set the BB and mod bmi_L to 1 and it is better, but the 'levels' stay tiny. but that is no problem. I find that your trading style does not fit with mine. I thank you for sharing it.

Hey BlueMental, Thanks for the warm welcome. I like it when you say "I want to get away from theory into something useful and usable". I appreciate that we have to learn the theory but I think too many Gann fans get caught up with the theory and cannot transfer that theory in day-to-day trading, and in particular short-term trading. I look forward to bringing what I can to the thread and I am keen to see how we all can help to evolve this into a fully fledged trading method. My brain is a sponge so let the soaking up of knowledge begin! John

Hello my friend BlueMental, good to see you again in the 'new hope and new prosperity' year 2013. about our beloved BMI_Long indicator, that why I made some adjustment in coding including the 'legend' function and multiplier function. If you want change the 'fit in' ratio so you can 'see' level at 3 digit pairs like yen pairs then you can use attached template that already set for GBPJPY (with example at picture 01). Another topic about 'renko stuff', as far as I know, 'true' renko will show you 'true clearly' the reversal in price movement since 'she' slicing the price movement range in 'constant' way according to your 'brick/block' setting. rather than 'standard' candlestick chart which slicing the price movement according to 'time range/frame' . You know that standard 'candlestick' invented by Japanese and then this 'renga' (brick in Japanese language) and later called 'renko' was re-invention of those 'candlestick' also by Japanese with purpose to 'see' more constant visual information on chart, and of course it will also 'feeding' more constant data flow to any indicators that calculate base on averaging OHLC data. (similar with picture 01 I give you 'renko' chart at picture 02). Just for 'funny' example, we know 'soccer' right ?. Soccer field 'measured' with 'metric scale' (renko), and also 'all' the another playing fields we know always measured with constant distance 'scale'. when in the other side 'for how long we play' that measured with 'time range' (time base candlestick) that sometimes so 'flexible' to adjusted (remember that 'injury time' , 'time out' etc).. lol. So, if we need some more 'strictly' constant result then we need constant 'metric scale'. Like my Japanese mentor said years ago; " your get gain if you bet in price movement not in time movement, so pay attention to price movement not in time movement'. this is what he said when I asking about what is the best time frame we should use. Time frame is only matter of how you 'sliced' the cake if you slice it 24 part then you get TF H1 , and if you slice it 6 part then you get TF H4, the cake itself is still the same.. Hope it help Best regard.

Once I used Point &amp; Figure charts for trading , and as I know they had almost same logic with the renko charting system. It was easier with them to see the horizantal supports and resistences. But it is not perfect too , because it turns off the availibility of Price Action stuff... I mean candles are better in a way because they can give you clear signals of bullish or bearish trends if you know how to read the footprints of the fat guys. Its not something scientific , just my thought , but the price itself is the indicator , so we shud not try to disguise it with some other shiny clothes. Or I shud say like this , such things shud remain as tools , but they shud never take the throne of the price itself...maybe I am wrong , but that is how I think...Renko charting system is amazing about making the direction more visible (like a kind of moving avarage) and helping us to see horizantal supports and resistences easier ... but on the other side It lacks some data which has great importance while trading : the footprints of the big investors ! Regards ...

Hi, my friend selym_co, it is alright if you choose standard candlestick chart as your 'main visual indicator' there's nothing wrong with that. I believe that every 'type' of charts is a 'tools'. The 'visual basic indicator' to represent 'what's going on' in the market. every type of it are 'indicator'. Like in candlestick chart the usual pattern terms such as doji, harami, marubozu, tweezers, etc just for naming some 'conditions' in the market. And that term only 'known' lately to the western world after 'candlestick' way of viewing 'what's going on' in the market popularize by Steve Nison. So, the Point &amp; Figure chart as it's name represent itself as to 'pointing' and 'figuring' similar 'what's going on in the market'. the other 'japanese chart' called 'Kagi' meaning 'footprints key' created to do similar thing.. So, as far as I know (forgive me and correct me if I was wrong) the 'deal information data' between market players is the first layer of indicator, the 'price movement/action data' is the second layer of indicator, the 'visual charting tools' like line chart, bar chart, mountain chart, candlestick, renko, etc become the third layer of indicator, and the 'line studies' including all averaging indicators and also object tools for geometrical charting is the fourth layer of indicator. No Matter what you 'use' to visualize and tracking down where the 'smart money' goes as long as you know 'what to see and how to see it' and make benefit of it then it will be great and hopefully if it 'share' with our community then become 'great help' for each others. About renko as one of price base charting tools, of course it is also could be use to watch "the footprints of the big investors". it is just a matter of 'how to do it'. and the more important is 'how you practically understanding it' . As you see in the example pictures that I give in our friend BlueMental thread here , I still use 'candlestick' too.. for me, it is not 'wise' to forget to bring our knife even if we already have a machine gun.. right.. by the way, 'nice circle trading journal' my friend. perfect curve always in parabolic circle shape that build up part by part from tiny cubes ( in modern world we call it pixel.. lol). have a nice trade and best regards. T.Kiads

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Thanks Kiads I will load and use the template. To both Kiads and selym_co. When you look deeply enough at price movement, from the Tick Charts, all the way up through to Decade or Century charts (if we had them), you find the same repeating patterns. The 'morning star', 'Doji' and all those other candlestick pattern terms, are not formed because they are 'Big Fish' Footprints. They are the footprints of ALL price action itself. The term 'ranging' is an incorrect and misleading term in itself. It 'implies' that the market is in a confused state. The market traders can get into confused states. But the Pairs themselves are never confused. They follow the fractal patterns always. It is like saying that a hill is 'confused and ranging' when the 'up' gradually flattens and becomes 'down' on the other side. The formation (erosion, earthquakes, volcanoes, silt deposits over time etc.) of mountains is also fractal. Their footprints are formed by the nature of their make-up. By what they are. The 'surface' changes (by Big Fish) are nothing more than that. The Big Fish do not and can not jactually move the market. They like to think they do, but the very worst they get is 'spikes'. The NEWS spikes and drops are nothing more than a spot off noise to the Price Action. The Bank Of England almost went Bankrupt by pumping HUGE amounts of money into the market at one time, thinking they could force a major change. Their major 'opponent' at the time was Soros. He played the market WITH her patterns. BOE opposed her patterns. Soros became a billionaire and could have but did not pull a fast one that would have liquidated BOE. Seeing these patterns and recognising them is what allowed Soros to use them. BOE, being arrogant in their perceived 'power' tried to dictate to the market and they got slapped in the face so hard that they realised they are nothing more than naughty school kids. What I like most about Rengo (thanks for the detailed explanation Kiads) is that it allows (by choosing the block 'height') us to filter out the 'noise' part of the price action. While it 'dims' our view of the 'small' footprints, it makes it easier to see more clearly where and what the price is actually doing. We can also see those same footprint in Rengo on a 'larger' scale. We just need to know how to look. I will be spending some time and effort looking more into Renko and what I can see and use from it. Needless to say, in my own 'mad' way, I will try to find other 'unconventional' perspectives from this style of charting. As Kiads says, the charting itself is nothing more than a tool of transporting price movement over time into a 'readable' human 'picture'. I trade predominantly from the M5 chart, but this is misleading. I zoom out to max and I have the H4 in front of my eyes. The bar period is as Kiads states it 'in modern terms' nothing more than 'pixels'. One of the things that I find most intriguing is the fact that we show zero representation on our charts worldwide of time NOT there. A more consistent charting structure would be ALL 52 weeks of a year charted with ALL 7 days per week charted. Those left out being greyed. The FibArcs and MA's are actually incorrect because of those 'chunks' that are bitten out. A better EMA would be to add a 'flat spot' to the EMA over the greyed out bars. This would give a more accurate and clearer picture of true price movement. Whether a coin is going to be heads or tails depends entirely upon the energy of the moment. What your thoughts arre, What the energy of the thing in your mind is, and when you throw the coin. The Chinese form of prophecy, called I Ching (pronounce Yijing) is formed by one method with the throwing of three coins. It is an incredibly accurate tool (I Ching) and it sometimes feels quite literally like you are speaking directly to God. Absolutely everything fits these patterns. We live in a fractal Phi hologram. The way our bodies proportions are follow these patterns, the way the oceans waves flow and ebb and in what direction and when, follow these patterns. The way dust floating in the air slpits light follows these patterns. Finding harmony within the pattern is pleasure. Trying to control or direct the patterns is arrogant and impossible. If one leaves 'this' matrix, they enter into the fractal Phi hologram matrix that this one is part of. The fundamental 'make up' is the constant that allows everything within it to change without anything ever changing at all. By using minutes as the x-axis for charting and allowing zoom in and out to 'condense' the price actions into bars of minutes/hours/days of our liking, allows us to represent scalar images (trendlines, Circles, ratio angles etc.) in a consistent manner that holds a solid X;Y relationship to the chart regardless of what 'zoom factor' the chart is in. If a Trendline that ends at x of 113451154 minutes is show in a D1 bar 'zoom factor' then those x minutes fall within the parameter of x1 to x2 pixels on our screen (and chart) that one day holds. The x value of the trendline does not alter when zooming in or out. Only the representation of the bar data alters. We need to evolve this charting infrastructure so that we can find better ways of 'seeing' the inherent patterns. Just like the Japanese invented Candlesticks. Rengo and Kagi, we can invent new ways of looking at the same data. In fact, it is the pattern inherent within us that guides us towards the creation and new understanding of things. It is the change of that which never changes.

Hi my friend BlueMental, this is really beautiful explanation.. thank you.. I hv example of 'previous' gap when market closed and re-opened after new year. in this picture no 1. EU M30 candlestick chart with sweetspot horiz line indicator set at starting point 1.3000 with step of 50 point (500 on 5 digit broker) and sub level of 12.5 point (125 - 5 digit broker). and EMA 8 applied to median (HL/2). Attached Image (click to enlarge) And in picture no 2. the SMART (Simplified Median Axis Renko Trading System). also on EU with 'brick/block' size 12.5 with starting/anchor point also 1.3000 and similar sweetspot and EMA 8. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I mark the gap with blue rectangle and aqua horiz line and we can see that EMA will reacting more smoothly in price base charting because it will adapt the gap (there will no gap in slicing the price it self). Look at the horizontal line created with sweetspot indicator in both type of charts. that actually 'similar' renko in different way that 'slicing' horizontally the x-price axis in constant step (12.5 point). from anchor point. This is only 'another way' to see the market that I think personally 'more better'.. corret me if I'm wrong. Have a nice trade best regards. T.Kiads

The Rengo (from now on I will call the Bricks bricks, not Brix(renko)) shows the true price change and 'block climbing' works 100% with the MA's etc. I need to explore how other indicators (BothMac and Magic Channels) work with Rengo. I also want to explore FibArcs and Circles. I still have not yet had a chance to check out what I get with your Template. LOL, I am (AGAIN) in a bad trade 100pips in the Red. I do not understand HOW I do these things. I see clearly that the price is going down. All the indications, patterns and everything I know shows me it will drop SOON and also most likely the exact spot it will happen, but somehow I convince myself to 'catch the quick up before the drop' &lt;slaps self in face&gt; &lt;slaps self in face&gt; &lt;slaps self in face&gt; &lt;slaps self in face&gt;

Kiads. You do realise (just by the way) that the "OsMA" Histogram (Olive - Value 2 titled incorectly as 'Signal') in the BMILong__ indicator is the Difference Between Signal And MacD. So the very second the MacD (Turquoise Line) crosses below the Signal Line(Black) it crosses on the Histo as well. The red Line is an 8MA of the Signal Line. I can not recall what my aim was with that. There were supposed to be 2 other 'added' features, but I coded it so long ago, I have no idea what my aim was. I obviously left it unfinished. The other 'Slope stuff didn't work out as anything useful either. But I guess it was worth a try. Something TRULY frustrating is that I once coded an indicator that worked with EMA's that were 'twisted' mathematically, and it showed long term BIG pip stuff 100% accurately with minimal Risk (like a risk of 50 pips for rewards of 400 pips or more!). I Called it 'Plucking The Money Tree'. and somehow, somewhere before I ever got to use it, my Hard drive got corrupted and I lost it!!!! I tried for 3 years to re-figure out those math 'twists' (I got them by basically experimenting in the first place.) but I never found them again That is one indicator I truly wish I still had.

Kiads, Which Rengo Indicator are you using on the chart in picture 2? My Rengo indicators (I only have 2 and If I recall I wrote them both) work only on separate_window. Could you either upload that one or tell me it's name so I can search for it. Thank you. ps. If you have the mq4 of it, that would be nice.

&lt;GRIN&gt; I am too stubborn to secure and I hope (knowing it will not happen) that the up spike will happen. I know that I will reach positive eventually but the stress is not good in the wait. Also I trade MBT, so I can not Hedge.... Means I can not trade actively (unless small/medium retraces in same direction as initial open trade) Oh well.... such is the life of the stubborn fool. I intend o put decimal 'accuracy' settings on BothMac, to see how it shows the 'BounceOffs' I think it will make it a better indicator.

Actually, in those type of broker you can do it with other similar pair, you can 'protect' your GBPJPY south retracement by open Sell at EURJPY that actually go south faster than GBPJPY at this moment. but maybe for right now it is little bit too late. I think all JPY pair only 'in retrace' since that Japanese government so desperately wanna make their Yen more cheaper whatever it takes.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Kiads (and others) What are your thoughts about this. So far untested, but I did check the idea backwards through the chart. It has good possibilities. I will test it further on demo before using it though. Your thoughts Kiads? &lt;edit&gt; Oops, I moved the forst circle to check something. It was in the bigger one to it's right and had an upward 'breakout' happening, But it would have hit SL (assuming I set one) and made a small loss (+- 20 or so pips). Remember, this is 'theoretical trading so far. &lt;/edit&gt;

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Believe me, I know all the hedging other currency pair tricks, but NONE of them move with the volatility that Grumpy Granny has. If I Hedge with GbpUsd, I need to triple the lots used to stand a chance of catching up. Specially if UsdJpy and GbpJpy are both going same direction opposite my open position. But yes, I do not stress too much since I too see it as a retrace, not a reversal. Not only because of Japanese wish for weak Yen, but also from what I see on charts. But as you know, I would much rather have caught 100 or 150 pips in a short position (and catch it as well on the way back up) than to sit and wait out the retrace... That leaves me with making pennies on other pairs. EurUsd moves so little the snails overtake it. I am a speed freak. AudUsd is usually a pretty good 'stable' one as well, but you wait 4 hours to reach 30 pips usually, before a retrace. If you want more than that, you have to wait. Yes, it is too late now to Hedge elsewhere. If I really get bored I will scalp on other pairs, and long scalps on GY as well.

For geometrical charting using fibo arch and other object tools stuff and implemented to 'renko' (do you already try 'my renko' my friend ?). I will 'show' you example of what is so called FACT (Fibonacci Arch Contrarian Triangle) is.. let we take GBPJPY for example.. first I will create FibArch with a lot of level with standard range step (similar to Fibonacci ratios but this is from quarter theory). the step range from 0% to 200% with increment of 12.5% ( how often you see this number from me.. lol). so the level will be 0% 12.5% 25% (which close enough with 23.6 % of fib ratio), 37.5% (near 38.2% fib) 50% , 62.5% (near 61.8% fib), 75% (near 76.4% fib) and so on until 200%. In my renko for GBPJPY using 12.5 point brick and with my monitor resolution, I use Fib Arch scale of 33 (of course this 'scale' matter could be debatable..lol). In this picture example, 01. I put this 'fib arch' at first retrace after uptrend , put the 'center' of Fib Arch at low (point A) and 100% level at previous high.(Point B). 02. I put 'triangle' (red color) at point A, B, and C . The Point C is where 'price' previously enter to the Fib Arch circle at 200% level. 03. the triangle will give us its center at point D. 04. then using 'Equidistant Channel (EC)' tools with ray option active, I start to connecting point D to point A with 'source line' of this Equidistant Channel and put its 'result line' at point B (light salmon) 05. I put second EC also with light salmon color from Point D to Point B as 'source line' and put the 'result line' at the bottom area of Fib Arch where I put the vertical line (point E with aqua color) that overlay the Fib Arch circle at level 100% this vertical line will also cross the 200% level of Fib Arch circle. so I put the 'result line' of second EC there. 06. By doing this, the first EC result line and the second EC result line will pin pointing 'where and when' the price will going out from the Fib Arch Circle. (Point F). 07. That is the one way to 'working out' with Fib Arch and Contrarian Triangle. If you notice the third EC (Bold Yellow Color) that its Source Line connected from Point C to Point A of the Contrarian Triangle, and its Result line put at cross between the 200% level of Fib Arch and vertical line of Point A. This line , or should we called 'channel' . it will show you 'next' high and low... lol. that happened at point G and 'perhaps' at point H. Of course this is only the basic of FACT geometrical charting. Hope it help Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yes my friend, I have used your Rengo, It is the 'right' Version. Thank you. I was busy typing up several posts about Gann Grids on selym_co's thread. Hence my 'delay' in response this side. Ok, I followed all you said and I can copy/do it all, but I do not understand what to use the Salmon EC's for. They appear to show the angle of the trends, but the up is predominantly 'straight up'/ In other words no down spots. I hope that the H mark IS the end of the downward retracement, otherwise I am going to have to cut my losses on my bad trade &lt;Grin&gt;. Thank you for your explanation, I am going to do it on some other parts of the chart to see that I get it right a few times. As far as using the scale of 33 for the FibArcs, I will use it the same since scale is different with Rengo than Candle Sticks anyway. Since you are familiar with this, I will use what you use.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Kiads my friend, this is insane. I now fully understand what you have told me about FACT! This is a gift of note. I wish you and yours good fortune and I offer you my thanks. I must have done something right in a previous life to build up good karma to get your two gifts. The Rengo and How to use it. And you say this is just the basic of FACT. I would very much like to learn more if you are willing to share your knowledge. Our chart history differs a bit, but the basics remain the same. This means that the FACT 'prediction' or 'projection would probably be a better word, can be set up with the blocks ending at the centre of the circle. All the data thereafter comes after and the trade entry point starts just after (in this case) the price action leaves the right hand side of the 200% arc. Ignore my question in the previous post about what the salmon EC's do. I missed point 6, but figured it out while re-doing the setup. My version:- http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/8475/factgbpjpy.png Thank You! &lt;edit&gt; What I did NOT put in the post was that this is a 300 pip up trade and a 190 pip down trade. &lt;/edit&gt;

BlueMental &amp; Kiads: First off, thanks for what you've shared with us. Secondly, permit me to share with you the SynBar indicator that I ran across a few months ago while researching Range Bars. Presently I've put it on 15 minute charts and created the corresponding offline charts to trade the results. The attached RangeBarTime indicator illustrates the speed of bar creation as follows: Yellow=1 minute or less / Orange=5 minutes or less / DarkGray=more than 5 minutes. Hope you find one or both of these useful. Take care. Steve

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Yes, My Friend BlueMental, what I show you in FACT example is only the begining of the whole concept of FACT 'projection'. Actually the first EC and the second EC both in light salmon color is only one of the way to know where the price 'probably' will go outside the Fib Arch 200% circle level. The 'real deal' was the third yellow EC line that taken from point C to point A in the previous FACT example, this is the 'real 'projection' and also this only 'halfway' of it, since the channel only 'projecting' the 'where' question and didn't completely answered 'where and when' question. Now allow me to continue, but forgive me if I must put a lot of picture to show you step by step about it. 01. I will re-drawing again from first Fib Arch from previous example and I will reduce the level to only the main quarter percentages. like 25% , 50% etc. I will not explained yet about the importance of this percentages ratio, later if we learn more further we will discuss about it. 02. Here we go at picture 01 same fib arch like previous example, but only one EC line (the third one) and I change the color so it similar to the fib arch color. because we will put another fib arch and also another EC. As we see in this first EC line give us 'channel' of future 'range' of price movement. probability of next high and next low that answered the 'where' question. but not answered the 'when' question. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 03. Now we will add the second Fib Arch at the same place just in reverse position with Gold color. So the first Fib Arch center at low, and this second Fib Arch center at high. We will notice at this picture 02. that the position of price when entering 200% circle level of second Fib Arch should be different and this is the fundamental of FACT system. and of course the second triangle will put at this position (yellow triangle without background). We notice the new 'center of this yellow triangle, that will become our 'reference point' for next EC line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 04. Next step is the answered of the 'when' question... lol. As we already 'see it' first EC line (previously yellow, and now light green) show the 'probability line' of high and low of the next price movement. and now the second EC line (yellow color) will show you 'when' the 'low' will touch the first EC. Just Connecting the 'center point of 2nd triangle (X) to point A (center of first Fib Arch - the low price fib arch). with the EC source line. and put the EC result line at the cross between 200% circle level of First Fib Arch and 200% circle level of Second Fib Arch. (marking with Z) and 'voila' the second EC result line will pointing to when the next low will 'show up' ... in the first EC line channel. (marking with LC - Low Cross, at previous example I mark it with H ?). Attached Image (click to enlarge) 05. And now, the third EC line that will answer the 'when high' question. the third EC line with Aqua color. for this EC line, we will connecting point Y of second triangle to point B (center of second Fib Arch) with source line of third EC, and lets put the result line at point marking with X2 which is the cross of source line of second EC line ( the low pointer in yellow color) and the 200% circle level of second Fib Arch (the high fib arch), and again.. now you will 'see' when 'high' probably happened and I marking it with HC ( High Cross). Attached Image (click to enlarge) 06. Well, that's it one of the complete set of FACT, of course it will not always happened 'like that'. there will be 'several' variations according to the previous market shape and conditions.. we will learning further about that, and also I should get some permission from my group for posting this system in public. But I think this basic part is okey.. for them.. lol. Ok then all my friends here, I hope you can understand my explanations and forgive me about my bad uneducated English language... Hopefully it help you all more or less.,, Happy trading and best regards.

Hi My Friend Steve, nice to meet you and thank you for your help. the SynBar (Synthetic Bar ?) is also price base chart builder and create emulating offline chart. for me I consider it as 'in between' standard renko and standard candlestick. It will be helpful for 'breakout lover' since it's still 'showing' sideways moment with more 'precise' range. in 'linear box shape'. the different between this one and standard renko maybe about the term of fixed size this SynBar has 'fixed' size in high/low and the renko (if wick activated) has 'fixed' size in open/close body. also the RangeBarTime Indicator definitely useful for renko chart since it will 'represent' momentum of brick building in time. maybe we can try to create more colors to make it like 'heat map'. I wiil try it in my spare time.. Once again thank you... n best regards.

Great Stuff Kiads. What you are showing us is stuff that I have thought of (some parts at least) and explored as best I could, but this is light years ahead of where I have reached. As far as the half. quarter, eigth, sixteenth etc. I have a reasonable understanding of it. The 'Halving the halves'. I actually was explaining a bit about it on selym_co's 'Circular Trend Wave' thread, with this post :- http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...21#post6327221 I actually get frustrated with what I call the 'metric mindset', where everything is based on 100's but in reality, when we make and build things, the simplest way of design and making is by halving the halves. That is how the Inch infrastructure is based. It is simple to comprehend how an angle was reached if shown on paper as (90/2)+(45/2)+(11.25/4*3) =75.9375° The final number on a technical drawing (or design sketch) does not give the viewer the 'how we reached this angle', which is also relevant to other parts and concepts in the design. The metric mindset ends up with 'random numbers' all singular and 'unconnected' parts that do not make up a whole. It is the basis for a lack of harmony of design, which flows into the disharmony of parts and the disharmony of the whole. It brings to mind the military rule of "No marching on any bridge" because the rhythmic 'counter-rhythm' will destroy the huge structure with a few hundred (or thousand) men. This intrinsic disharmony flows ever outward and creeps into the (if it did not actually already exist there to start with) mindset of the people using it. Like a virus it causes disharmony wherever it goes which later leads to collapse. To me, I feel insulted when I see a machine that is built/designed 'backwards'. I think to myself. how can someone spend years to get a degree and then use it to design something that works against itself, against the tradesman that must maintain and constantly repair, it as if it were a weak boned child. The Metric Mindset. I have explored other areas of my Rengo Charts, trying out different block heights and different scales, and I find that this pattern (the FACT pattern you show us) is not always easy to find. Obviously it is still very new to me and an untrained eye often can not see the elephant that is standing on his foot. I find the scale issue in particular to be something of primary importance. It seems (I use the word because I do not have enough experience to know if it is true or false) that as the block height increases, so too must the scale. I am trying to find a testable/measurable method of calculating a scale ratio that 'fits' regardless of the block height. This so far is the only source for disharmony within the FACT geometry you have showed us. Since the pattern does not fit every situation, I feel it is important that we do not have a scalar 'weak point', What I am trying to say is easiest described in a hypothetical situation. Assume I find a situation where the pattern fits and the beginning phases of the price leaving the 200% all 'fit' but as it goes forward, it misses the 'when' and also the 'where' on the primary EC. It could be because I used the wrong scale for the FibArcs, or it could be that my scale is 'correct' and the price action has deviated from the pattern to follow some other pattern unknown to me. This makes it difficult to find out the true source for my failed geometry. Is it a "I did something wrong, or did not see the elephant" or is this situation something that falls outside the given parameters of what 'this' version of FACT is capable of projecting. I will now study what you have offered us and try to get it to sink into my brain as quickly as possible. I will do my best to lose my first 100 games as quickly as possible. Thank You.

Hello All Friends, Thank You for all PM that I received, mostly asking about renko chart builder program code.. please forgive me that I can't share it in public for some reason. You can always searching similar type of program code for that.., I believe it will not so different, the point is not 'which tools you should use' but 'which tools you understand most' and it could be only 'single line in the sand'.. About all renko and Fib Arch stuff is only my 'side talk' with my friend BlueMental. This is not main 'topic' of this thread. The main topic of my friend BlueMental Thread here should be MaCD and any related calculations and probabilities to understand the averaging Convergence and Divergence of Price Movement. So once again please forgive me, but if you interested about that stuffs in general term, feel free to ask here, and I believe that my friend BlueMental has 'open wide' heart and mind to welcome your questions Happy Trading and Wish You All The Best

Hi, Sir... About this 'scale' matter, in my personal experience it won't fit with standard candlestick at all since in every candle in any time frame, the size was unpredictable. Well, personally I found my 'own calculation' to handle this 'scale' matter and one of the 'key' is using the price base chart to take the advantage of their constant candle size as building block of price movement. Let's thinking little bit out of the box.. lol. The question of 'how big is our playing field' ? In soccer game of course you can answered that easily, but in our trading game ? well, for me our field size was 1 lot standard contract of $100.000 or 10.000 pips. That is our 'field range' in my point of view. So, what is the relation about this 10.000 pips with the 'scale' ? then this is all about the 'resolution' . My graphic card resolution was 1920 x 1080 per monitor or in 'ratio' was 16:9 . In this 'funny' calculation then 10.000 pips with that ratio become 10.000 : 5625 but if we talk about circle than we need just half of it (you are so true about 'halving the halves'...) so actually our 'circle' ratio was 5000 : 5625 and in reverse we get constant number 5625/5000 = 1.125. In my previous example about FACT, I give my renko brick size = 12.5 point / brick. actually this is 'halving the halves' process from 10.000 pips until smallest 'range' size that still convenience to trade for GBPJPY that hv spread range about 5 to 8 pip. Since my renko chart was 'median axis' then we should double the size so 12.5 x 2 = 25 point. Multiple this 25 with our constant number of 1.125 = 28.125 this is actually our 'scale'. but I added that 25 point with 5 point average spread = 30 point x 1.125 = 33.75 and rounded down to become 33. and this is the Fib Arch scale for renko brick size 12.5 point. in that FACT example. Anyway this is only 'general calculation' that I use in my personal point of view about the 'scale' in MT4. may not definitely right but so far I'am convenience with it. Now, about the 'field'... lol. Actually, we can 'select' our field according to 'last condition' so, for our 'brick' as a building block of price movement can be very flexible as needed. let's take an example of your favorite pair GBPJPY, and we will 'select' our 'field range' from standard candlestick chart TF H1 in example picture 01 bellow. Attached Image (click to enlarge) the 'range' was 663.8 point and let's die hard 'halving it' until 32 parts with size of 20.74375 point this is our building block 'brick' of renko. so, set the renko starting point for GBPJPY from 135.865 and set the renko size with 20.74375 block size.. lol. and for the 'scale' of Fib Arch, we will use that 'funny' calculation above, that 20.74375 x 2 x 1.125 = 46.6734375 or just 46.67 as our scale for this renko chart size Fib Arch. I put Fib Arch center at low 135.865 and put the 100% level straight up at 137.524 (25% of the range). (aqua Fib Arch) and put dotted horiz line at 200% level fib arch and dotted vertical line at right side of Fib Arch also at 200% level circle, and then put diagonal up trend line (Solid Aqua color). so, it is look like 45 degree for me... lol. here we go similar range of above H1 standard chart in renko version..at picture 02. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Changing the zoom ratio will change the shape of Fib Arch, but will not change her 'line' relation with 'candle' in the next picture 03, I Zoom in the chart with same level as standard candlestick chart at example picture-01, and add dotted horizontal and vertical line at 100% level circle of fib arch.. and add Mr. Andrew 'pitchfork' at cross point with same result as ordinary diagonal trendlines pointing 45 degree in 'calculation' not in 'visual' convenience.. Attached Image (click to enlarge) With the example above, I hope we can simply have 'funny calculation formula' for dealing with 'scale' in MT4.. hope it help Wish You All The Best T. Kiads

Hi Again, one of our friend here PM me and asking 'is there any pattern in price base chart like renko that similar to standard candlestick chart ?' Yes, of course and the reason why it called 'Simplified Median Axis Renko Trading' is for the purpose to simplify the problem of memorizing that hundreds candle configuration in standard candlestick chart. As you know, to become 'master' in standard candlestick chart at least you must memorize and understand 'whats going on behind that pattern' for says 25 to 50 candles configuration, and according to Japanese Candlestick master there approximately more than 400 pattern/configuration known until today..lol. For example..this popular 'Doji' what kind of Doji ? at where this doji 'show up' is there any similar doji before etc.etc.. or uptrend configuration like 'three white soldiers' how come if the 'fourth' soldier show up next.. ? and the 'fifth' and so on.. then this configuration become 'white soldiers parade' and you will 'in doubt' waiting for 'three black crow' to 'appear' after that parade.. lol. In 'Median Axis Renko' the basic was emulating 'fractal' for any turning point. As we know the simplest fractal consist of 3 candles, and normal fractal for 5 candles as pattern of reversal just like our 'hand' shape so sometime 'fractal' also called 'Buddha Palm'.

Fundamentals influence the price action. The public perception of 'We are in a recession" or "We are in a Boom" is a 'readable' or 'measurable' reflection of how and what the core movement of the fundamentals are at any given point in time. Indicators (as you say, a line drawn in the sand is an indicator, as is that 'feeling' that business is bad/good is an indicator) are just another way of 'seeing' part of the whole. To me, there is actually no difference between MacD, Renko, Kagi (assuming I understood it enough to use), fundamentals or the sudden price rise at my local store. All of these things are relevant to the whole and all in their way are 'broadcasters' of the actual patterns of life and energy. The only valid differences between any and all these things/ideas/viewpoints, is how well I as an individual understand them enough to use for better trading (and living, which are in the end just different sides of the same coin). So, though this might seem somewhat strange to any who think strictly along lateral viewpoints, to me (There are many reasons that 'mental' is part of both my user name and my given name) I see connections in discussing how to make a pizza that is relevant to better living/trading. In a way the Mayan phrase "In Lakesh" is a way of trying to say what can not be said. It means in a 'simple' sense that We Are One. Like all fingers but of the same hand. In a deeper sense, All Is One. From your house, to the sand on the beach to the radio and light waves. The pattern in all things is one and the same. MacD, Renko, Stochastics, Random guessing. You might enjoy another way of saying it which I wrote here :- http://www.google.co.za/url?sa=t&amp;rct...,d.d2k&amp;cad=rja

I am not a Sir, I have never reached Knighthood. I doubt (if ever some queen or king decided that I should be knighted) that I would agree to stand on that pedestal. I followed how you calculated it etc. but that is not what I mean when I say the scale in particular is important. The picture I posted earlier was done with Renko on data from MBT's mt4 demo server. I decided to download the M1 history for more exploration. Some strange 'bug' happened and I ended up with 2006 to December 2012, then a gap (no bars) til January 2013. This led me to use another Mt4 brokers data that I have which is FXCM . My m1 data in with that broker runs from 1999 till now. The geometry you showed me, did not work on the FXCM 'correctly' because of the varience in prices, the main EC, along with the triangle are at a totally different angle and the channel, (Yellow EC) does not touch the high OR the low as it did with your chart and my MBT chart. There is also a slight but noticible difference between my MBT chart and your ones explaining FACT. This led me to wondering... Does pattern vary, or is it the 'noise' created by different broker (or areas of the world) that causes these 'aberrations' in the data. I think that each 'local' region/broker/group trading/viewing/participating with 'local' data is different from other areas and regions and that is part of a bigger pattern. So, in having this different data, I found that using the scale of 33, which 'almost' fitted perfectly with MNT data, did not fit at all well with FXCM data. http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/1...pjpyrenko1.png Using the first 'retrace', which as you can see in the FXCM data it is actually a Higher Low followed by the second Higher Low. In your data (and MBT) it was a Lower Low. http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/679...pjpyrenko2.png While the 'pointer' EC's do show where price will leave the circle, the 'main EC (Supposed to be Yellow) is not the 'right' size or angle on either picture. I did not do the other way round FibArc and Hi/Lo pointers on these pics (for clarity and more truthfully because I am feeling lazy), but they do not point correctly. (I did them before). So this brings to mind several points of interest. My primary issue is finding the right scale that fits with the pattern, NOT how many pips of price movement happens or does not happen on my screen. Yes, I obviously would prefer precise projections that can get me 1000 pip minimum risk projections, and if I can find a scale that DOES fit with the pattern and can and does do it consistently, then obviously I will use it. But the other issue is the variances in data. These differences as are clearly visible if you compare your chart pictures with mine, are not noticeable at all on a Candlestick chart. They stick out like a sore thumb on the Renko chart though. Is there any 'underhanded price alterations' going on? I think the answer is no, not at all. It is that one broker is ecn which is driven by Banks and large institutions trades, while the other is 'small fish' traders trading amongst themselves, with 'some' big fish that pop in for a snack every now and then. Since MBT is my live account broker, obviously it suits me to find the right scale that works with their data (If I can solve the missing parts bit) but it still makes one think.... The pattern fits everything and everyone. I seek the 'global' pattern as opposed to the 'local' one.

Hi, my friend Maybe you can check first, in standard candlestick chart TF M1 for both broker FXCM and MBT at 'that different high/low time' so you can 'assure' that the difference came from the source HST files. in the 'builder' indicator, try to use nearest starting point from that area of 'differences' occur. let say if the FXCM has 'higher' price at same time with MBT than use that FXCM price as starting price for both brokers.. and 'see' if builder give similar 'slicing' after that point.. But I'm so sure that 'understanding' will lead us to make anything in harmony regardless 'what tools we use'... keep exploring my friend T. Kiads

I only know some of the basic patterns, I do not even bother with the names (names of things has never been one of my strong points), like the pin, hanged man, morning star, or the one selym_co posted recently on his thread, which I called Bear have baby in reverse (No idea what it is ACTUALLY called). The point is that to me, all those doji's and other 'patterns' are not really very useful. They have three thousand six hundred and eighty two point zero three five nine (on average - plus minus) if/then issues that go with them. The stochastics being in oversell and and and... The more 'reliable' ones, like the head and shoulders or the (I call it sunken head and shoulders) on your picture, are more useful to me, but I do not base opening or closing a position on them. I just do not have enough time or energy to 'store' all those things in my head. I look for simple stuff. For example, ignoring that it is bouncing off a sweetspot .25, and ignoring that the second low (which equals all the following ones) is a Highe Low than the first 1 Block 'dip', and also ignoring that the price breaks above the HH and reaches the next .25 sweet spot..... Those are all easy to see in a chart that holds them as history. In the live edge of the screen, they are still there as and when they form, but not as visible. What to me seems most important of all on that picture are the wicks, on the first up part before the 1st '1 block dip' there are 3 wicks. this shows that the Bear is getting heavy and the Bulls can't push up as much as they would like to. Then the 2 wicks (both the up Block and down) show a 'tug of war' which = doji. 3,4,5 and 6 I see as (depending on which is the ]mother]) Bear having baby in reverse. The wicks of the second block in each case are higher than the 'baby' and the 'mother' drops below. In other words the High and Low are both Higher and Lower than the baby. 2,5,6 and 7, although the wixks are higher (or lower) they are very close to equal. Meaning they are hitting a wall. Testing, but not breaking through. A general view of the wicks show that the downs have more wicks above them than the ups. So the Bulls are pushing them more than they are pushing the bulls. Wicks with Renko (as is Renko itself) is still pretty new to me, but that is what I perceive at the moment. This brings to mind that the Renko blocks should not be TOO small in height, otherwise they just look like candlesticks. That is what makes the wick have more meaning. This is not something that I ever considered until your mention of wicks. Thank you.

I wonder about the historical data myself too. I've downloaded daily data from my charts and listed them in a spreadsheet and have found many days where there is no data. I was doing this to determine the silver gold ratio. On some days there would be a silver price and no gold price and the reverse on other days. So, the market was open but data was missing for some reason. The best I could do to correct the missing data was to use the previous days closing price. You should check your data for missing days. That can change the slope of lines, etc.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Yes, my Friend.., that's the common problem in MetaTrader Platform. If You download History data via History Center Tools then what you have is 'history data' from metaquotes not from your broker history data. Day by day history data came from your broker and sometime it also 'mismatch' fot some reasons like 'server connection' bla..bla. bla. Maybe better if you ask your broker CS to send you History data files. Sometime right click on chart and refresh it will help too..

Not to be one to complain too much, but with each new 'upgrade' to Mt4, instead of fixing the fundamental faults in the infrastructure, they polish the 'bling' instead. We do however have Metaquotes to thank for opening trading (forex and others) to the general public. Before them, it was an Institution and Elite only situation. The management of Metaquotes should however focus on the fact that if you do a Google search for Mt5 brokers, more than 40 are listed (mostly that list was made in 2010 when the 'awaited release of Mt5 was anticipated), yet if you go to those same brokers that 'offer' Mt5, you find nowhere to download Mt5. You do find Mt4 though. Not only that, many brokers are now focusing their attention on building in house trading platforms. Some are Java based, others are desktop. The point being that the general 'trend' is moving away from Metaquotes. While they still hold the majority, the 'wicks' are showing retracements and soon reversal is imminent. If they (Metaquotes management) were to try to realise that traders needs and wants are what a trading platform should be based on, rather than adding more 'features' without repairing the foundation, then the house built on sand will collapse. If you have happy traders using your platform, you control the market. If you have unhappy traders, you have many competitors gaining strength while you struggle in the quicksand. The only realy stable data I have found is data direct from tickfeed. In other words, as long as I stay online, my data is strong. If I download it in any form from any source, the 'metaquotes bugs' creep into the woodwork one way or another. Build 455.... You would think after 455 rebuilds, that things should be improving. If I have a knife stuck in my leg, and I go to the doctor. He doesn't remove the knife. He gives me pain killers instead. If he were to remove the knife, he loses a recurring customer (or so he thinks). I read somewhere on the web that in Thailand, you pay your doctor a monthly fee as long as you are healthy and well, When you get ill or unwell, you stop paying as he is no longer doing a competent job. I do not know if this is true, but it seems to me to be the right perspective. Many software Institutions no longer sell their product, they rent the use of it on a yearly basis, while using the 'buyers' infrastructure and resources to 'upgrade' the software that is so weak it permanently needs upgrading. Knife in leg. Metric Mindset. Backwards. It is only a matter of time before Linux GNU based becomes the majority OS. Who needs 'glass Caption headers' when there are now so many 'features' running in the background that Windows has become a pinprick to look through? XP had it's problems, but it was stable. Since 'upgrading' to Windows7, I have more hassles and system hanging than I ever had with the 'Old/Slow XP' The same is true with Mt5. You do not need to be a rocket scientist to see that an Mt4 (mq4) indicator that is 28 KB's and does the same job as an Mt5 (mq5) indicator that is 450 KB and wonder why Mt5 is sluggish.

Thanks Kiads, I will look deeper. (I am currently looking at so many things at the same time my eyes are exploding LOL. But they are used to it.... Same as it ever was. Just by the way, I didn't give a public recap of my 'blunder' buy on GbpJpy. It dropped down to -208 pips, and getting in only 1 18 pip buy scalp, I ended on Friday at a loss of 4.8% to my account. The trade is still active and I expect to hit green in the coming week. Needless to say, I would (of course) have been far more happy if I caught the 200 pips going short and again up going long.... Can't win them all I guess.

One cool thing about Mt4 is the ability to 'transfer' history data via CSV. If I cut and paste the FXCM GBPJPYM1.hst to the MBT history folder, the Platform hangs. So the easy way to do it is to open up the FXCM Platform, 'export' the M1 data as CSV, then Open Up the MBT Platform and import it as same CSV. It updates immediately.

My Friend, please Re-Check again your 'center of Fib Arch... , In my first example about FACT this is Low Fib Arch not High Fib Arch.. the center position of Fib Arch should be at low point l( I mark it with yellow circle and also yellow triangle at your pict).

Hi Kiads, Ok, I am going through it again completely from the start. I missed the post of yours written earlier about the starting price maybe part of the difference. I rebuilt a new Renko chart on M4 (The one used so far is still stored on M2) and by checking the Lowest Low and Bar Count on the Onnline M1 chart, I used the exact LL and 20 or so bars before it as MaxBar Count. The two charts are identical. I am now going to go redo the geometry (slowly and methodically) in case I made a mistake earlier. I will post as I continue.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
LOL, You have a nice way of showing an idiot he is an idiot without stating it directly.... The centre of the FibArc is in the wrong place! I put it on the top of the triangle instead of bottom (LL of retrace) It all works now. The 'pointer' To Low misses by a fair x-axis distance but is not far out on the Price. It is not far off enough to cause concern. The High pointer is spot on. So too are the two pointers that show exit of 200% arc. The Probable Channel is also spot on. http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/1...25blszgbpj.png http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/120...25blszgbpj.png I found that if I placed the secondary (pointer part) of the Low Pointer EC (Yellow) tangent(touching) to the 200% of the Red FibArc that it points to the Low spot. I think that due to the data differences, that in a trade before the Low was actually touched, one might use the 'range' from 2 Arc crosspoint to 200% of red (Highest point). If the price does not touch by that time, then it would be safer to say 'I no longer expect it to touch' and close/open accordingly.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Something else that I just thought of regarding the FibArc Scale. We are working on offline charts in which the Renko is stored. The 'Timeframe' of each Chart is defined by whatever I use in the Builder Indicator. So if I have Block Height as 12.5 'stored' in GbpJpy2.hst and I have 12.5 Block Height 'stored' in GbpJpy1441.hst It should make a huge difference in my scale settings. Since Mt4 'translates' scale onto chart related to minutes per bar. So the Holding vessel (The M2 or M1441 Offline Chart) needs to be calculated backwards to accommodate. As you know, while we can build a file called GNPJPY_Renko1.hst, but the 'filters' in the "Open Offline Chart" do not allow us to open a file of that name. Perhaps using a 6 digit fake 'pair' might do it. I will check. Strange. I rested my ideas about the scale differing as mentioned above. This is not true. I built a GBPJPY2.hst with 12.5 Blocks from an M1 chart, I built a GBPJPY1441.hst with 12.5 Blocks from a M1 chart, I built a GBPJPY2.hst from a M5 chart and finally I built a GBPJPY241.hst with 50.0 Block Height from a M1 chart. The scale of 33 is the same in all except for the final chart. In other words the scale differs in relation only to Block Height, not the Offline charts 'Timeframe' So your calculations as described are not affected because they use the block height as well. Nice to know.

Hi My Friend BlueMental, 'Slightly' different just 2 or 3 points of 'where we placing the point' in A to B line will become big different in result at far distance especially if the distance between A to B is 'short'. Could you re-check again the 'tip' of your both Contrarian Triangles of Low Fib Arch and High Fib Arch. This is important because it will determine ''where the center' of both triangles and of course will give you different 'result' in EC direction in the next step.. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The most 'exact' way to make sure that 'the point is there' is by edit the parameter of the object tools ( Time Line and the Price Value).... Hope it help Keep exploring my friend... T. Kiads

Yes My Friend, the 'naming' of offline chart doesn't related with 'time frame' as we know for standard 'online' version of chart. its only 'a name' ( I do explaining this before maybe in my e-mail).. so M2 offline chart with M1442 offline chart will be exactly same in 'time point of view'...

--- 帖子 #293 ---
So I use (on an uptrend) the Low of the first block that touches the FibArc Line. I did, before posting it, in my last picture try moving the point to the block before and tried low and exact point of touch (which varies sometimes with the Mt4 'scale wobble' but the Low Pointer EC moved only a tiny bit in this case. Still, if I had used the FACT geometry for entering trade in this situation, I would be very pleased with results even if I got some parts of the geometry wrong. I also found that the centre of the Triangle was on a 'half a bar'. In other words I could place my EC start behind or in front of it. What I did to solve this problem was place it as close as possible at first, then afterwards pulled it 'longer' and made sure it passed through the centre point but only on the EC's that would be made more accurate that way.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
How do you know which swing low and high to set the centre of the fib arc to? Or does it matter?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
If you go back to the first post Kiads wrote, you will find that he mentions that we use the FACT Geometry on the first retrace on the uptrend. The triangle and EC's etc get placed accordingly. Don't stress to much if you mess it up. I have done it at least 15 times from scratch and I am still making a mistake or two. Redoing it is good. It gets it to sink in to the brain. Saying "This is too complicated", or "It didn't work" and forgetting it is what most people do. Those that push on and put a bit of sweat into it get something of value. Asking is the first step. Doing is its partner.

Hi My Friend, This picture could tell you a lot... and answering what you are searching for.. This is Fundamental thinking of FACT base from old knowledge from Sailors in the past... lol... Don't you familiar with that Square at the above right ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Kiads. As you can see, I placed the positions in different placements. The reason for the different bar starts is because on full zoom in, the FibArc touches the bar before, but one zoom out click and further, it touches one later. I found that for the Probability EC, that the best was the 'middle of the bar' placement in the Non full zoom (later bar), while the 'exiting 200 circle' was best with non full zoom at low of touching bar. The way I look at it though, is that, since we know there are variations in price, mt4 scale wobble and human interpretation, that as long as I treat the geometry as a guideline, not a "The price will reach 141.31541" type of mindset. In truth, if instead of making 300 pips on a trade, one makes 250 and stays within 'safer grounds', I prefer the 250.

It looks like a physical representation of The Vedic Square or The Starr Tetrahedron. The lines appear to represent joining lines of a 3d Pyramid Structure (Cube of 9?) on a 2d sketch. I am not familiar with it, but I would like to be. &lt;GRIN&gt;

--- 帖子 #299 ---
The 'Sailors Picture' and my 'Exploring Renko' Picture are similar. They use the Arcs Formed by the Price Variations to determine placements. What I am searching for is a geometric method of finding Reversal Points, and Price 'destinations. The Renko style of chart fits well with this because time is not in the chart. The price is the 'time'. Universe has no watch, but is never late. The cycles complete themselves and other cycles spin off from that. &lt;edit&gt; I forgot to mention, I used 12.5 as FibArc Scale in that exploration. In other words the same scale as the Box height. Don't ask me how or why, but instinctively (I can feel it in my bones) I feel this is of key importance. &lt;/edit&gt; In my country, the 'Native African' cultures have what they call 'Amadhlosi' or in translation, 'The Ancestors'. They have a full and clear understanding that all and everything has an ancestor. Nothing is 'new', it is all formed by it's 'father'. We are 'spin offs' from our ancestors and while our children are similar to us, they are not the same pattern we are, but they are formed from our pattern. The word 'Shaman' here in South Africa is 'Sangoma', They are part of the 'spirit' field, and though they are most well known, there are many other variations involved. For example, a Sanusi is a 'seer' or prophet, that by communicating with the Amadhlosi, can see what is to come. The Sangomas are more Herbal and Spiritual Healers. Most of what they do is herbal with use/communication with the Amadhlosi. You also get what is called 'Tagathi' which are more Amadhlosi based. They use the connection with the Amadhlosi for personal gain. In the western world, they would (in the past) be burned at the stake as witches. Sometimes, when a Tagathi does too much 'bad stuff', the Locals do a form of 'Tribal Justice' and burn him in what is locally known as 'The Necklace'. They put a car tire around his neck, throw petrol (gasoline) on him and light it. Their variation of burning at the stake. There is a lot more in the world than most ever dream of.

yes my friend, 22.5 , 45.0, 67.5 of Cube of 9 that actually also angle of every corner of both contrarian triangles to their center... at FACT we called it 'Arm'. and 'show you' any possible directions.. from any point you place it.. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I hope you notice that same color 'meaning' same direction..

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Yes I see it. They way it is drawn though looks as if you are viewing the Pyramid from above. The way I draw it (from corner of the square) is not as effective. I was just saying to selym_co in his thread, he focuses primarily on 45°, that is only one of many. It is not 'more' important than the others. What matters most is what angle the price 'mood' is following in any given situation. It is not tii dufficult to see when it chooses a different angle. Something else I noticed is that many people seldom zoom out to max to see the 'general mood' of a pair. They (the prices), like us humans, have habits that they stick to. We can pretty much trust that they will continue repeating those habits. This we can use to our advantage. Knowing exactly when a reversal or retrace is going to happen is not as important as it seems. Recognising it while it is happening is to me more important. Knowing that price is following 1:2 upward trend, but the last 4 or 5 bars show that she has swapped to a 2:1 down is a good way of saying 'close trade'. Unless her habit shows that when she goes from 1:2 it is usually only a short retrace. The 'bigger picture' counts a lot. Panic (or other variations of fear) usually happen when we are looking at 'too close' a scale. A big reversal takes time. If your lot's used is small enough to avoid the margin calls, you can usually wait it out even if caught in it. Greed is the one that causes us to have bought (or sold) too much so our margin risks are too high. One of the advantages the 'Big Fish' have is that they have large Capital to cover them and no leverage. They can pretty much wait out anything. It might take 3 decades, which 'costs' because the capital is not building, but if need be they can wait. We individual small fish (if we can even swim well enough to be called fish) do not have that advantage.

Here is one of my indicators, called FibFanDuality You can put it on any bars, no matter if you set it on High, Low, Open, Close or anywhere in between. In fact, you can put it on 'open space' on the chart and look back or forward through the chart and you will see the price following these FibRays. They are all derivatives of Fib Numbers, like the inverse of the cube root of a Phi Number for example. They are 'magic' numbers.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
This one is on a Renko 12.5 Barheight chart.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Here is FibFanDuality used 'backwards' from three 'random' positions on the Renko 12.5 Blockheight chart. This is why the word Duality is part of the name. I am not joking, these are magic numbers.

Brick 'sizes' or 'angles' or 'periods' is similar to Camera Lens Focus, with the 'right' focus, you will get 'clear picture'...

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Are you guys using RenkoLiveChart V3.3x2 to get the brick sizes of 12.5? I tried with this but it only accepts integers, not numbers with decimal places.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
No, My Friend BlackStack.. I create my own Renko Chart Builder Indicator.. and I'm sorry can't share it here.. but I can make that standard RenkoLiveChart V.3.3x2 to become decimal please wait.. when it's done I will upload it here.. hope it help T.Kiads

--- 帖子 #308 ---
My friend BlackStack, that v3.3x2 was EA version and won't work at weekend You can try this standard renko builder Indicator version.. that already accept decimal put in expert/indicator folder like any other indicator..

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Thank you Kiads, your indicator is now installed and working. Better now that it is not an EA too.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
My first chart upload attempt. I drew one fib arc, and then it seemed like the price wanted to go above the top line. So I drew another fib arc and now price is between the two lines from the arcs. Still respecting both line though. The colours on the upload are not the same as on my chart. Don't know why that would be. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

"You will know it when you see it," said Meriam, answering a question she hadn't asked. "Why must you all make it like a puzzle?" demanded Liath. "Why can't you just tell me what I'm looking for?" "Because you won't truly understand what it is we work toward until you have discovered it for yourself." Liath began to protest, but Meriam raised a hand for silence. "It is all very well to protest that because you have seen a horse ridden, you know how to ride. But you don't know how to ride until you have yourself ridden. Isn't that true?" "I don't see— "You don't see because you persist in thinking that the art of the mathematici is like a story, something you can understand equally well whether it is read to you or you read it yourself. But the art of the mathematici isn't a story, it is a skill, like riding a horse, or fighting, or administering an estate, something that takes time and effort to master. Would you set an apprentice weaver to weave the king's royal robes? Ask a novice to illuminate the Holy Verses? Trust your life to a pilot who had never before sailed through these shoals? You, of all people, must understand fully."

Hello All Good reading!!!!! Anybody still using this technique of trading?? Regards

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Absolutely, jd. BlueMental and Kiads have provided the essentials for a very robust trading methodology. Enjoy the journey of discovery. Steve

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Still I am Using This Beautiful System with my own Indicators. its too good. Thanks to Lance Bluemental and Kiads.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Can you please share your indicators?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Dear lance Bluemental, Too much time gone by starting this thread, but still it is golden concept of judging market. One small mistake was there, that BMI Long indicator is showing MACD Histogram and OSMA. if you were taken two time frames comparison it was another level of accuracy. here is an example

--- 帖子 #319 ---
vijay how profitable have you been with this system

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi BlueMental, thanks for your wonderful indicators... Need a favor...I hope you can do it ... Can you add time frame to all the four indicators 1. ema 6 - bands_bg macd sepwin 2. ema 6 bands sm macd sepwin Thanks

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi bluemental.. Really appreciate your time and effort on this monster indicators. After all these years on trading, i have analyzed so many indicators to find a strategy and all took a lot of time to predict and finally after finding your thread it made me to find THE ONE easy one.. Need a small favor.. i hope you can do it can you add time frame to all the four indicators Expecting a reply from you very soon.. T i am waiting.. and thanks to you bluemental.. Thanks a lot..
