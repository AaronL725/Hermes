Hey guys! So many traders are reversal traders, always looking for tops and bottoms trying get in as early as possible, but we know that is not as easy as it seems and many times we land up with fake reversals or temporary pullbacks, chasing and adding to losing positions etc, which only ends in losses..

Now I'm sure most of us have heard the sayings that the "trend is your friend", "follow the trend", and "trade with the trend", etc, so I gave this some serious thought and came up with an idea that I have been working on for a long time. I know that there are probably 1000's of trend based strategies and perhaps mine is not unique, but it has been showing positive results with minimal time and effort. I wanted to create a strategy that is easy to follow and with as less chart and screen time needed (max 10 mins) kind of like a set and forget approach.

So here goes! The first thing you need is the Trend indicator LuXingMod AUD indicator, this is a free indicator I found here on FF (thanks to LuXing), it simply shows all the pairs candle direction for each time frame if it is green/up or red/down, simple. I've attached it to this thread.

Now what is the entry criteria and when do we open and close an order?

1. First we will edit the indicator settings to only show the H4, D1, W1, MN bars/candles as we are only looking at higher time frame trends.

2. When? On a Monday night 1 hour before the first daily candle of the week closes we will look for any pairs where is a confluence between the trend on all 4 time frames.

3. Any pairs that have the same confluence on all 4 time frames we will open an order in the same direction.

4. I normally wait for the first daily candle to be pretty much fully formed so more or less 1 hour before the Monday daily close.

5. When do we take profit? You take profit when you are happy with it or you can set your own TP in pips or %. I have set a 5% TP.

6. What about a stop loss? Well this is a personal preference, but I'm setting a max of 10% so if my account goes -10% of my account equity I'll close up for the week.

7. Can we set a trailing stop to trail profits? Sure that would be a good idea after reaching your TP.

8. This whole process should take you max 10 mins to look for valid pairs and place your orders.

9. Anything else? No that's it, simple right?

This is a really easy strategy guys, not much in it, we are simply following the overall main trend of the market. This is a weekly basket style approach where we will hold orders for 2-4 days depending on the market. This strategy does not take into account fundamentals or high impact news events so if you want to be extra cautious you can exclude any valid pairs that might be affected by related news events for the week.

I am also working on a new weekly setting that starts on a Tuesday morning and I am working on new daily sets that catch the daily trend and can be traded daily.

If you guys have some ideas on how to improve on the strategy I'm open to listening, however I will not encourage ideas that will completely deviate from the original strategy as its really simple and I don't want to complicate things.

I'm a fan of EA's and think they are great tools if used correctly so I had an EA made for me based on this strategy. The EA is pretty straight forward I think and should be easy enough to understand. The EA is also pretty customizable so you can also trade it on other sessions and time frames, you only need to configure the settings accordingly.

I have set the expiry date to 31/12/2023. This is protect it from being sold or commercialized etc.

*Due to some members comments I felt the need to state publicly that the Follow the Candles EA is FREE and always will be! The is no hidden commercial agenda or plans to sell the EA at any time.!*

Please guys let's stay on topic and try not to deviate too much from the original strategy. I will not tolerate any arguing or keyboard warriors, those that can't participate in a respectful friendly manner will be removed.

Green pips to you all! Cheers! :-)

On Monday night after the first daily close candle of the week I'll post and share my valid pairs for the week.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
The indicator doesn't load properly on my chart .  The indi might work correctly for me if you showed the template you are using.  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Manual added curruncy pair indicator input,,,

thank you share strategy mrdfx

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Ok, so how do you calculate your lotsize?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Nope ... not the problem.  Something else.  Here's the screen shot from the H4 and Day1 AUDUSD

I'd show you the settings for the indicator but I can't seem to be able to figure out how to do that.  Thanks anyway.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
If the indi loads correctly on your chart, would you be so kind as to post your template?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
change here

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Nope ... that just moves the rectangular gibberish to the right.  If it works for you, just send the template.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Unless your saying I have to manually load all 28 pairs.  It was pre-loaded with just the AUD pairs.  I'll try that and let you know.  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Ok ... here's what it looks like now.  Not the nicest, but  I think I can work with it.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
The problem in this system is that when the trend will start to change, it will takes time (and so stops losses) before it turns in a red/green dot on a monthly and weekly chart

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Here are the settings I'm using. You need to play with the X and Y as it is dependent on your screen resolution.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Well lot size would depend on your account size and risk tolerance?

For testing over the last 3 months I have been using 0.01 only to count the profitability of profit in pips, but going forward I will probably use 1% risk per pair and increase the risk over time if it does well.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
We can't calculate risk if we don't know stop loss in pip??

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I would like to help.

I'm trying something new, its not a system yet.

I'm manually keeping track of sentiment.

I downloaded "sentiment indicator" from fxssi website.

The only thing is it doesn't show historical data on sentiment. So I cant really back test it to see how price reacts to change in sentiment.

The idea is to go against the herd.

For example if the indicator shows 60% or above buying it will say short and vice versa.

I started 2 days ago and i'm just loggin percentage values for each pair everyday.

For example I want to see percentage value to go from 85% to the other side -60% and see how it effects the price movement.

And we can take trades based on the candle system. If all green and the sentiment is 60% or above sell than we buy.

There could be other filters added: For example don't take trades that go against each other.

If we have a buy signal for EurUsd and a sell signal for Eurcad don't take both signals only the better one. You don't want to sell one Eur and buy the other Eur.

I will post the indicator here but I don't know if it can be copied.

If you are not able to copy it from here, download from this link. https://fxssi.com/fxssi-sentiment-lite-mt4

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Empirical it is then, until obtaining some formula, taking into account the risk, average weekly excursions (favourable & adverse) per pair and the number of pairs traded every week.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
This is the way I love to work. Thank you to open this thread. Go on.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
general rule:

probability = 0.80 = 80%

if 7 consecutive candles are green, #8 will be red. and opposite is right!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
How can I get this indicator

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Finally a question I can confidently answer ... at the very bottom of  post #1.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
All the charts below went from below 60% to above 60% recently on the Sentiment indicator.

Also the carts are all green on all 3 timeframes.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Using sentiment, contrarian trading, "trading against the herd" is an old trading approach that's been explored a few times here on FF if I recall. I remember a guy named neilsdigest had a thread talking about it where I participated a bit, also Ill-b-back has a thread on it. I can't remember why I stopped exploring this approach but there was a reason...

It is something that could be looked at as an added filter.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
depending who you believe,neilsdigest wasn't above board,good luck with the thread though

--- 帖子 #25 ---
It is not a system as of yet.

I don't have a way of looking back at the history of sentiment, so I am doing it manually. And perhaps in a month or 2 I could get some idea as to how price reacts to sentiment change.

If anyone has an idea about plotting the sentiment history or code it somehow it will be great.

The indicator I posted earlier updates every 60 min . It is suppose to be the average of the following.

FXSSI, INSTA,SAXO,OANDA,FIBOGROUP,IGG,DUKAS,FXBLUE,FXFACTORY,MYFXBOOK

There is also something called "current ratio" and it also shows the average of the above but only shows 11 currencies+gold+usd index.

This can be downloaded from the fsxxi site but you have to sign up for the demo.

I dunno the difference between the 2 indicators but for now I am keeping track of the sentiment indi.

I will post next week the progress.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Here is how the current ratio and sentiment look  together.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Very interesting will be keeping my eyes on this looking forward to hearing more can I ajust the pairs that I trade which is about 7 pairs thanks

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Nice thread, your system seems really interesting.

Just one question, if you don't mind. I don't use MT, I use tradingview...

Which indicator do you use to determine the trend?

Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Finally got the indi to look halfway decent ... been working on this all afternoon.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
interesting system, i want to try !

--- 帖子 #31 ---
interesting system

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Very nice Idea! Is there a trademanager were we can set basketprofit and stop in %?

Greets,

Klausi

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Will be following. Looks interesting. Thanks for sharing.

Regards

--- 帖子 #34 ---
In my personal opinion, one simple way to follow this strategy is to enter in a retracement of a trend.

Example:

MN bullish, W1 bullish, D1 bearish. Well, enter with a buy at the end of the day and set a stop loss at the open of the D1 candle.

MN bearish, W1 bearish, D1 bullish: enter with a sell at the end of the day and set a stop loss at the open of the D1 candle.

If the trend is strong, let´s wait for an inverted candle in low TF (H4 or H1)  to enter again in the main trend.

Of course, the next D1 candle may be the continuation of the retracement and we need the help of an oscillator that can show an overbought or oversell condition or a recovery strategy of the loss.

--- 帖子 #35 ---

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I was not talking about the person I was referring to his contrarian strategy thread which did have some good nuggets of knowledge.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
The indicator is on the first post?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks for your suggestion however this seems like a completely different approach from the original strategy. This strategy is trading the main overall trend not retractments. I also don't see how adding an oscillator will help in this strategy.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Tonight I'll be posting my valid pairs which will be traded for the week.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
good thread,thanks for sharing!

I am little skeptical about going against the sentiments,going against the sentiment means going against the trend, that is what market makers do, so we are trading in line with MM,that is very popular concept given by BTMM lately.

but  MM can manage to go against the trend, do we manage to take the sl or hold the trade against the trend unless we have a very big account or any hedging or martin strategy? so going against the herd is a good concept ,but it is not as simple as 123.

if anyone has seen you tube clips of VP , nononsenseforex.com.he suggests to go with market sentiment if it is 80%.

I have got a better suggestion,one can enter safely after the pullback following the trend at leat 4h time frame,i would suggest to go with the trend of higher the time frame and not against it.

good luck in shaping this strategy.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
what is dfifernt im doing that this is not showing like this?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
wow this sentiment indicator is responding very well to the price actions and it is unveiling MM intentions

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Alright this weeks pairs are locked and loaded! 12 valid pairs for this week.

I'm a little early on the opening but, this is the time I have to check the charts tonight.

Lets hope for a profitable week!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Off to a good start. +145 pips.

If this was live I would have taken profit for the week.

I did forget to open the trades at the correct lot size for the account of 0.03 instead of 0.01 in which case the basket would have hit 5% profit. I'll let the basket ride and see where it goes, but another successful week none the less.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
G'day mate,

Interesting, however, with respect, could you tell me why you would have closed your winning trades already instead of moving your SLs?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I'm not greedy and I have my weekly/monthly trading goals so making 5% for the week is good for me lol. +5% for the week is a pretty decent profit for only one trading strategy. Sure you could trail your profit and is probably a good idea. I've left the trades open to see how they do this week.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Very nice system, thanks mrdfx.

I entered the same trades plus a couple more.  +40 pips so far.

Newbie question: how do you create the open trade chart from post 44?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
+200 pips nice.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I use this indicator which I found here free on FF.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
How do you calculate your 5% profit target.i mean 5% of what ? My capital ?Another question I like to ask is if indicator is set to monitor trend from 4hr to monthly chart,what time frame am I going to pick mine entry from ? Is 4hr or something lower

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I think its not that important. Yesterday after monday candle close i took a basket with 4 pairs where only the daily/weekly/monthly color matched. The basket was in profit today morning. When taking the 4 H color of the first 4 H candle of the day its the same as the daily candle color.

Nice stuff mrdfx!

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I took the EURCAD pair short ... what I noticed was that if I switch from the Daily chart to the Monthly chart, the indicator squares change color.  The first pic is the daily chart ... the solid blue line intersects the indicators EURCAD.  All 4 squares are red.

The Monthly chart shows different colored squares.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
this dashboard is not working for me.someone plz guide me

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I also got similar problem at beginning. Try use original settings and Change the xy position only.don't Change the color .

--- 帖子 #55 ---
thnks it worked

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I think the initiator of this thread uses H4 TF

That's probably while he can see at a glance the close of first H4 candle,  before picking the pairs to trade.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Please can some one help me out here, i try to load the trend indicator in my mt4 platform but it is not coming up

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Can someone please share how you guys determine your tp and sl ?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I calculate 5% based on my total account balance. The 5% is based on a total weekly target.

It could be anything though, you are welcome to choose your own weekly target whether it be in pips or % or in $, its up to you how you want to set your targets.

The indicator is set to monitor 4 time frames for overall trend direction, it does not matter what time frame you enter on.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
When the indicator is loaded it does not change colors when switching time frame, I'm not sure why that's happening to you.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Setting TP & SL is a personal preference. You can set your TP & SL based on a set amount in pips or % of equity or however else you want.

As this is a weekly basket of pairs I think its a good idea to set a good weekly target and a fairly large SL to allow for swings, for example I set a TP of 5% which personally for a week is very good, and a SL of 10% which allows for the pairs to swing but not too large that it would cause a huge loss.

This is how I'm doing it for now but that could also change over time.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
have you thought of any basket of direct or inverse correlation of pairs? etc

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I'm really not looking to complicate the strategy any further. I do not check for pair correlation or currency sentiment, I simply follow the main trend of the pairs and trade in the same direction.

The idea is to KISS so that anyone can trade the strategy successfully.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
goodluck my friend,do u think trading is that easy? that on Tuesday when first 4 hour candle opens,we check the confluence of 4 tf on this dashboard and enter the trade?

I would suggest to take 50 trades on demo on this strategy and if there is 70 percent win rate,then only one should go for this strategy.I myself will try this,do u suggest to do this only on Tuesday or everyday on opening of market ,first 4 hour candle finishes and we enter the trade?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi mrdfx, I saw you are using a 10% weekly stop but I don't understand how do you obtain 0.03 as lot size.

Could you exlpain?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Is that sarcasm I'm sensing? Why should trading not be this easy? Why make things complicated? From what I've seen in my years of trading, the more simple you can keep things the better. I've done hard and complicated and it didn't improve my trading.

I'm not why you keep referring to a dashboard, there is no dashboard used here, only a simple candle trend indicator.

If you read the first post properly you would have read that I have been testing this strategy for 3 months and have compiled enough data for me to take this one step further and even open a thread to share it to everyone.

Where did you read trading on a Tuesday??? The basket is opened ONLY on a Monday night after the first daily candle is closed, please go back and reread the first post.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Alberto_Jazz, when it comes to lot sizing I use a simple calculation of 0.01 per $200, I got this from trading the CCFp strategy and the lot sizing works well so I've applied it to this strategy for MM. This isn't fixed and I might change it up as things develop so feel free to use your own preferred MM.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
hi mrdfx, thanks for the thread, i'm in.

but i've a question regarding your reply :

"Where did you read trading on a Tuesday??? The basket is opened ONLY on a Monday night after the first daily candle is closed, please go back and reread the first post."

according your rule4 , issn't maybe 3 hours after monday candle close - tuesday already ?

best osha

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Thanks Mrdfx, indicator worked great.

Do you usually keep all trades opened till Friday close,

or do you monitor each trade and play it by ear, or sight.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi!

- Do you use an EA or script to close all trades when you get profit?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Just out of interest to myself and  others viewers can you share any details about  how this system panned out in the last 3 months mrdfx,thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Oshadiif, ok if you being technical then yes it is Tuesday early hours, but its still Monday night for me when I'm opening the orders.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
In my original testing I was closing all orders on Friday afternoon shortly before NY closes. I was leaving the trades open the whole week and monitoring them to see when they hit their high and lows of the week and what kind of pip range I was getting.

Now that I have compiled enough data I probably won't be keeping the trades open till Friday as they more than likely will have hit TP like this week.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Currently I'm not using any EA or script, but I do have an EA being made for me by a friend which will then open and manage the orders for me. The EA will follow the rules of the strategy.

I'm still not 100% sure about the EA as I've seen many times here on FF and with my SDTR thread that some strategies don't always work out well when made into EA's, but this strategy seems simple enough that it should hopefully work out.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
no it was not sarcasm,it was the truth in my opinion,if trading was easy ,there wouldn't be 95% failing.anyways.

its a trend indicators,my apologies,i was refering this as dashboard.

I thought you know the very fact that many experienced traders don't trade on Monday for some reason,because market makers trap the naïve traders,so I thought u r referring first daily candle of the week closed means u trade on Tuesday.

and what do u mean by basket? more than 1 pair right? so do u take the pairs what is all green in trend indicator? every pairs has its own dynamics,fundamental news attach to it,i don't believe in opening same direction currency at one time,it may bring serious DD,but good luck if you are so optimistic about this strategy.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
... when i look at this in a technical way means when i would this put into an indicator or EA i'd need to be precise about the candle offset i'd need.

so lets assume at 3am in the morning tuesday, all 4 time candles have to be in confluence.

but for

H4 would i check previous (last monday H4) candle or current (already formed but not settled) candle?

D1 would i check the previous day (monday) candle or current (already formed but not settled) ?

btw: my broker has GMT+3  so i don't have any Sunday candle.

best osha

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi fellow traders,

in my few spare time I like to search FF looking for new threads that hit my interest.

After having stumbled in mrdfx's "Follow the Candles" that I appreciated at CCFp strategy times, I've decided to write a trade manager to exit trades according to OP instructions in post #1.

First and foremost I want to say that this trade manager is provided "as is", therefore don't ask for mods or usage and test it on demo first.

Its params are self-explanatory and its use should be straight forward, put it on Experts folder, load it on a chart and let it do its things.

It has (optional) trailing and an optional partial close feature.

This last one, if activated, will make the EA close only the trade carrying the biggest floating loss when the account reach the preset _X_PercentLoss instead of closing all the open trades.

I'm not currently trading this strategy for lack of time, however I hope to be able to give it a try in the next weeks.

Important Warning: current EA version doesn't close all trades on Friday at NY close in case they are still open. This decision is left up to the trader.

Best regards,

Bubincka

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi I have loaded the indicator but the lime and red color of selected time frames candles are showing as gray. please advise

--- 帖子 #79 ---
You are complicating things. As I explained in the first post.

2. When? On a Monday night after the first daily candle of the week is closed we will look for any pairs where is a confluence between the trend and all 4 time frames.

3. Any pairs that have the same confluence on all 4 time frames we will open an order in the same direction.

That's it, that's all you need to do. Whichever pairs are currently all green or all red you buy or sell, not more complicated than that.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi bubincka, man thanks for this trade manager! I'm sure it will help many of us!

I see that it picks up all open orders on the account not only the pairs opened for this strategy. Is there a way that it will pick up only the pairs that were opened for this strategy and not other orders opened by other systems or EA's?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi mrdfx,

unfortunately atm it's not possible, I always trade every strategy in its own account so I don't mix things up.

If I'll have some spare time I'll add a magic number so that the trade manager could pick up only trades opened by your strategy.

Best regards,

Bubincka

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I have a problem with the indi too ... mine changes colors whenever I change time frames.  Renders it pretty useless for obvious reasons.  I have no idea who could/would straighten it out.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi mrdfx great indicator i have got no problems with the diffrent colors on difrent timeframes the only quetion i have for you is i want the indicator at the bottom of my platformon the left hand side how do i do this

thanks again for a very usefull indicator

--- 帖子 #84 ---
This EA will show Current Profit, Highest Profit and Lowest Profit since basket opened. It give you an option to close all trades in basket when target meets. It will only manage the trades that has trade comment as in input.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
So, what is that indicator based on ?

Is it from moving average, psar, BB, or what combinations ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi mrdfx, if MN and W1 are bullish, but the Monday D1 candle is bearish, do you wait the Tuesday candle to check if it's bullish or you don't trade all the week on that pair?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi bubincka, no worries thanks for your efforts regardless.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
The indicator is only checking the current candle/bar if it is up or down, there is no other indicators or extra code.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Alberto_Jazz, if the D1 candle is bearish I will not trade that pair. All 4 time frames need to be the same to be valid.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Why I am getting a weekly bearish candle showing on the indicator when the last closed weekly candle closed bullish. Has anyone else noticed this? The active candle is slightly bearish but I thought the indy looked at the last closed candle. So a weekly candle colour should only change once a week.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi mrdfx,

You stated at the beginning that you wait for the first H4 candle on Tuesday to see how it behaves ( I understood that this candle also should follow the trend indicated by the 4 timeframes alignment ), and after this you open the trades. But you don't wait for the end of that H4 candle ...

Please can you specify one more time: it's all about only the 4 timeframes alignment, or that first H4 candle on Tuesday have any significance in the trading decision ? If the second, which is the meaning of that first H4 candle ?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi mrdfx,

since it was quick and easy I added the parameter "orderComment".

As default it's set to "" (empty string), you can set it to everything you want, e.g. orderComment = "mrdfx", and the trade manager will be able to manage only the trades that have that comment as input.

Best regards,

Bubincka

--- 帖子 #93 ---
The indicator looks at the current candle not previous closed candle.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi forexcentric, I look to open the orders after the first daily candle of the week closes an while the first H4 candle of the new day (Tuesday technically but still Monday night). Yes it is all about the 4 time frames being the same in confluence. The first H4 candle is not any more important that the other 3 time frame candles it only needs to be the same as the others.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi bubincka, thank you for your time and effort. So just to clarify this EA will pick up the manually opened orders? As far as I know you can't add comments to manually opened orders?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Sorry for maybe idiotical question, but what will happen when you will enter the trades in friday close?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Yes, you can add comment in manual orders

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Damn we learn something new everyday!

I've never paid attention to that, perhaps cos I don't normally open orders that way I've never seen it lol. Thanks NoNonSenseFX!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
We making progress on the EA I was telling you about. It should be ready by the weekend hopefully then forward testing for bugs next week and if all goes well I'll upload it for everyone.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Alright, I have a question.

If I understand the indicator correctly, it tells you the color of the current candle on a specific TF (not 100% sure if I'm correct).

So you open your trades after Monday's daily close candle and during the first 4 hour candle of Tuesday.

If this is all true, during the first 4hrs of Tuesday, won't the first 4hr candle of Tuesday and Tuesday's daily candle always be the same color?

If yes, why do we need to use 4hr timeframe in the indicator?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi mrdfx,

NoNonSenseFX already answered your main question.

I want only to add that you can attach a comment to trades you open using a Script/Expert by OrderSend function and the EA will consider them as well.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Well the first week is over and its been a good one. Max pips recorded that I saw was a little over 200 pips which is pretty good for 1 weeks trading with little to no effort.

Next week I'll be using the EA to manage the orders, hopefully all goes well and its another profitable week! Cheers guys! :-)

--- 帖子 #103 ---
That is very encouraging.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
My version of EA for you to play around starting next week, expire in one month. EA can run on any TF and one chart only. Sorry mrdfx if I step on your foot.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hello Mrdfx.

Very nice first week, for me max profit (200 pips) was achieved 6 - 8 hours after I opened my trades. I opened trades at 8:00pm Monday Oct. 21. Central time

U.S.A. GMT - 5:00.   After that basket went into drawdown for rest of week. So maybe that is the strategy right there.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Thanks NoNonSenseFX, no worries if it works according the rules of the strategy.

My EA still needs to undergo forward testing for bugs before I upload it here.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
mrdx

In Post#43 you enter GBPUSD long ar 1.29639 (against your rules).

GBPUSD is down ca 140 pips.

And in Post # 102 you have a profit?

No idea about the other pairs as GBPUSD is first one I checked.

Can you explain this?

Bert

Hi PipsRUs99, yes this week profit hit very fast, though most weeks of testing I noticed a peak normally around Wednesday before a retrace.

There were 3 weeks out of the 12 weeks of my testing where total profit peaked around Wednesday and then by Friday had retraced and were in DD, that's also something I'm looking at currently that if TP does not hit by Wednesday to perhaps close manually, but this needs more testing.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
bertpost, GU was valid according to the rules if you check #43 you can see the indicator is showing green on all time frames. At the time of closing the basket GU was in profit.

#102 is showing the max high of the basket that I monitored this week, not the numbers today.

[quote=mrdfx;12570918]Hey FF! So like myself many traders are reversal traders, always looking for tops and bottoms trying get in as early as possible, but we know that is not as easy as it seems and many times we land up with fake reversals or temporary pullbacks, chasing and adding to losing positions etc etc.. Now I'm sure most of us have heard the sayings that the "trend is your friend", "follow the trend" and "trade with the trend" etc

Nice thread. Subscribed.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi all.

Thank you Mrdfx for sharing your experience.

I like when things are simple, so I'm backtesting this strategy first on EURUSD pair from MT4 StrategyTester, since 2017.01.03 till now using my sample expert advisor.

I know backtesting is not the most precise method, but I just want to see how different input settings behave and see max DD with fixed limited TP in pips, entry time according to rules, forcing hard exit before Friday if there are still opened trades and so on.

Next step will be constructing a portfolio of currency pairs and test live on a demo account.

For trade report I use the last customized version of indi which can show also the last closure's datetime for each pair.

Regards,

Paolo

What is your findings from your backtesting?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Looking at the current candle does not seem to be very helpful as that candle can close bearish or bullish. So it's a 50/50% guess.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Bug fixed for profit calculation.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Attached EA trade according to strategy or its only for take basket profit?

back testing no result, details explanation please

--- 帖子 #116 ---
it is for forward testing according to the rules.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
EA placed only trade once in backtest in very first day after than no trade in full year?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I am only at the beginning of test session.

Testing tick by tick on MT4 datasource logic is not the best approach, so initial results are discordant and limited but encouraging.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Clearly you have not paid attention to the first post not grasped the methodology of the strategy.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
All systems check and ready to go.

Lets all hope for another profitable week!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Check the image properly and then read first post.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
as you said in rule no 2.

When? On a Monday night after the first daily candle of the week is closed we will look for any pairs where is a confluence between the trend and all 4 time frames.

your image shows still 28-10-2019 1st day of the week which was not yet closed. Anyhow if you want to auto trade with EA that make sense.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Yes and is the image showing any open trades yet? Is it showing that the basket has opened yet? Please read and check properly before posting.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
exciting. Way to go.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hello mrdfx,

In the case of AUDNZD where it closed yesterday in all green bars. But just after an hour after the market has opened, the bars changed color and not all are green already. Do we still take this trade?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Wait about 2.5 more hours. That will be 4 hours after the daily close. Check the indicator, open buys on all pairs that are all green, open sells on all pairs that are all

red. Use your own personal MM system for tp and sl. Last week I was +200 pips in 18 hours. To bad it's a demo account.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
And we are a go!

15 pairs this week, lets see how it goes.

Good news is that the EA opened all orders as it should. Just need to test the trailing stop and then it should be good for release.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Thank you mrdfx! looking good so far. I opened my trades right after close of D1 candle. got excited and forgot criteria #4 )

--- 帖子 #129 ---
9 orders, so far in the bank!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi mrdfx, I'm testing my own EA of your strategy and it opened 15 pairs too.

It's possible they aren't exactly the same as yours because I saw your basket was opened at 03:00 while I set 03:59 as opening time.

TP = 5%, SL = 10%, TL = 3.4%, let's see out it will turn out.

Best regards,

Bubincka

--- 帖子 #131 ---
At the moment my basket it's not going well... it touched -9%, very close to SL.

It can also depend from the fact that I set Open Basket Time # 03:59, while mrdfx at 03:00.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
similarly..... the first ones did well but these... I still have faith!!!

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Unfortunately the basket hit SL this morning. It went as high as +4% before retracing and hitting -10% SL.

The main losses came off from GBP pairs which jumped from Brexit news, so perhaps it would have been a good idea to leave out GBP pairs due to their current extreme Brexit volatility.

Anyway this is how we learn and btw this is only the 2nd time the strategy has hit SL in my testing so far so there's that. Its all good I'm going to make some tweaks to the EA that I picked up and release it soon for everyone. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi mrdfx,

even if I too hit 10% SL, I'm still on the run because I activated partial closing mechanism, e.g. when you touch -10%, the trade with the biggest loss is closed.

In my basket it was GJ and after closing it I'm currently at a floating loss of about -3.50% with a realized loss = -2.26% that is far better to recover than -10%.

Of course using partial loss mechanism can make you an overall loss bigger than that initially planned, that' the other side of the coin.

Instead if trend changes you're still on the line for a profit.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I suggest you not to trade all GBP crosses and all CHF pairs..

Hope it can help.

Cheers..

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Would it not make sense to apply different position sizes to different pairs based on there pip count/ATR?

In my testing of multi pair systems, over the years, I notice that some pairs have huge wins and huge losses and other pairs have little wins and little losses, never really knew how to combat this...

I think it should be based on pip value...any ideas.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I entered my trade for the  basket at 3:45 min after the day candle has closed and i had eight currency pairs without GBP because it didnt qualify.I just closed the basket with profit of 33 pipps when i read most of you hit stop lost.

The rules should be very clear..How long can someone wait before closing trades?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Here is my trades this week. I don't set SL, but I set a profit target for individual pairs and global target to close all trades when target meets.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I waited a full 4 hours after Monday close before I opened my trades. At that time only 7 pairs were in trend. This is where I'm at now. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hello,

This thread (and strategy) is interesting.

But for me it makes more sense to have the indicator showing the colour (bullish or bearish) of the previous (closed) candle of the respective period.

So the trader would choose the periods he/she wants to look at (MN, W1, D1, H4, H1, whatever), but the indicator would show the colour of the last closed candle of each of those periods.

I hope this is not a too big deviation from the thread's theme.

And I believe this is a relatively simple change to make on the indicator, for a coder.

So I ask, can some coder please make a new version of the first post indicator, so it incorporates this change?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hello FxMachina, I don't see how looking at the previous closed candles will be better than the current candle as we are looking at current price action not past price action. This looks like a clear deviation from the original strategy so if its something you would like to pursue please do so in your own thread. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
mrdfx,

Do you mind answering my question here: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post12580910

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi NoNonSenseFX,

can you please tell us a bit more on individual profit target and global target you set ?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Individual pairs TP set to 50 pips. Global target depends on how many orders opened. Right now I set it to $200 with 0.1 lot size. Late last Sunday I entered a basket, some pairs hit tp early and the rest hit global target and all closed Monday morning. Total profit closed to $360. I entered basket not strictly according to original rules.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
G'day,

Were you using your FollowcandleEA.ex4 ?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
@mrdfx,ive been looking at your strategy and combining it with 'Monthly profit-Daily Trading using SMA' strategy the results are really encouraging,check out the other thread you could be on to something with this.thank you

--- 帖子 #147 ---
How do you combine both strategy together ?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hello Mrdfx, thanks for this strategy. I'm waiting for the EA. Pls don'nt put a time limit on it. You could find some other way to keep people away from commercializing it. I like to have an EA i can use forever. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Human is too lazy..Just wait for a day candle to close and after the first 2 hours to 4 hours ,watch an indicator and place trade which you are going to do it ones in a week yet people need monkeys and EA's to trade it..Shaking my head

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Yes, shaking my head. For some people that time is when they are dreaming $$$ in bed.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks for the compliment!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Interesting.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
During my backtest on single EURUSD pair, start trading on Tuesday 3:05AM, 5.000 balance with initial 0.02 lotsize every 1.000, fixed TP in pips or %, fixed or % or no SL, force closure on Friday, I haven't reached good results from three years by now althought just positive. But, if I anticipate trade operativity to Monday evening and introduce multiple orders, results are better than expected with tolerable DD.

I'll continue testing ...  maybe extending the operativity to all days just to find the best signal period.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
@dkarev, trade on the D1 candle ,if Week and Month candles is green on Trend indicator luxing Mod AUD indicator go long but only when the 5 SMA has gone through the D1 green candle ,D1 candle, if week and month candles are red on Trend Indicator luxing Mod AUD indicator go short but only when 5 SMA has gone through the D1 red candle...Trade at your own risk...Cheers :-]

--- 帖子 #155 ---
OK,thankz I will definitely give it trial and get back to you.

hi, this is my result for first week that i tested this strategy. i opened my trades exactly the same as mrdfx except one pair (NZDCAD) that my broker didn't have it. i didn't set sl/tp manually but sl/tp was 5% of my account balance that didn't hit none of them, so i closed all trades today.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Here is my results from this week! I can't wait to test it out again next week

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi all, in screenshot is my result for first week.

I opened trades at 3:59 on Tuesday and I've activated a partial closing mechanism that closes trade with the biggest floating loss in case 10% DD is reached.

Therefore I closed the week at a score equal to -6% instead of -10%.

I attach the EA I've written where you can set among other params day, hour, minute for open & close your trades.

simple words, tough concept

I heard of this statement at the beginning of  2012, I understood it at the end of 2018

Hello mrdfx,

Is pepperstone your broker?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hey hey its Friday!

Ok guys added to page 1 and attached is my version of the EA based on this strategy. The EA is pretty straight forward I think and should be easy enough to understand.

The EA is also pretty customizable so you can also trade it on other sessions and time frames, you only need to configure the settings accordingly.

I'm running a little side test to see if it can be traded daily during the London session following the main intra day trend, its still too early to say but if its successful I'll let you know.

I have put a 30 day expiry on this EA to protect it from being sold or commercialized etc. At the end of the month I'll upload a new version.

Ok guys have a good weekend and see ya on Monday!

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes I use Pepperstone.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
[quote=mrdfx;12595038]Hey hey its Friday!  Ok guys attached it my version of the EA based on this strategy.

Thx for the ea,..mrdfx,..

If i want the orders open by account %,..i only need to put,..true in the imput,.Use risk % of account

If i put 10%,.that means all the orders will open with a total 10 % risk or is 10% for evry trade ???

--- 帖子 #169 ---
"A trend 'with momentum' is your friend" is it how it should state... just like the statement "practice makes perfect" that's not true. It's "perfect practice makes perfect" because there is always a chance you could be practicing wrong... and as far as trends go, it helps to know when a trend is getting exhausted.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Yes correct you select true to use risk % otherwise the EA will use lot size.

The EA manages the orders as a basket and will manage the risk % for all the orders not individually.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Niceeeeeee,..thank you

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hello mrdfx,

Shall I have to load the currency strength indicator at the chart while trading with the ea?

Thanks.

Morning all,

i am struglling to choose 3 time frames starting from weekly,would u please guide what 3 time frames should i choose,because weekly and daily is fine but 4 hours is in contradiction many times,so what 3 timeframes goes in same direction?any guidance would be appreciated!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I have loaded the EA with its default.

Are you trying to fit TFs to create a potential trade....? My ONLY advice is read page 1 again, the strategy on Page 1 says: MN,W,D, 4H.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello mrdfx,

Thanks. Noted. I have run the EA on a 4 hour chart with default settings with Pepperstone broker (for the test run).

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hello salimc, you can load the EA on any chart time frame, the EA does not look at what time frame chart you using it is only looking at the time frames selected in the EA settings.

You can use default settings, you only need to edit your money management settings to suit your account.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
hello mrdfx

thanks for your advice. Now will be waiting for the broker's 1st 4-hour candle on Tuesday.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Pls will you be posting your trade here so we learning the strategy can correlate with our own to see if we are on track. Thanks

--- 帖子 #181 ---
@mrdfx - you could improve the efficiency of the EA by removing the check for the trend on either H4 or D1.  This is because H4 and D1 will always be the same as it's the first candle of the day, making the daily trend at that point the same as the H4.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
hey mrdfx

many thanks for sharing the EA. annoyingly, i had a computer restart today and might have missed the boat for basket launch today. However another issue has come up - all the boxes on the EA are greyed out. the indicator is loaded on the chart with the correct settings though. before the computer restart, this morning all the boxes had red and green colours.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

any ideas?

thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #183 ---
try to restart your MT4, it may fix your issue.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi blamshakk if you seeing only grey boxes then it means the EA is not reading any ticks on your terminal. See if your terminal is connected and there is ticks in your market watch window. If not try restarting your terminal.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Ok this weeks basket has opened! 14 pairs this week.

It will be interesting this week as we have a new monthly candle still forming so we will see how it goes.

HI MRDFX,

euraud in your weekly basket shows BUY but presently the indicator gives a sell signal,can you nplease explain?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Looks like my demo account on my VPS never took any trades either. It complained of having no connection and a 'common error'. Please keep us updated on how it goes with results this week. Reloading the EA doesn't do anything. I'm guessing this basket for this week will now be missed right? Thanks

I use IC Markets

--- 帖子 #191 ---
mrdfx, I must commend your magnanimity and generousity in putting this system in place and making it available for the public.

I want to plead with you not to allow nay sayers or ungrateful elements to prevent you in this kind gesture.

Ont this same platform, I have seen trades opened by people claiming to be expert traders instructing others. but they end up blabbing, just beating about the bush without any meaningful content.

But in your own case, you made it bare by hitting the point which has truly proven to be promising.

I tried out your approach for the very first time and I was amazed at the result. I did not use the EA, I simply used the indicator and opened my trade 3hrs after the close of the daily candle of the new week as instructed. I closed all trades manually about 8hrs later having made good profits. I even realized that I could have made greater profit if I still allowed the trade for another one to two hours.

Mrdfx, You are truly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
The EA opened 12 trades for this week at 3am of Tuesday. it seems better than first day of last week, but judgment is early. let's see how it goes.

I think I've found the problem, I was an hour too early (market was closed when my broker tried to open trades), adjusted out by one hour (Open basket time is now 4:0), and set to trade Wednesday (purely to test trades are placed at the correct time).  Thanks

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Do you have auto trade enabled on your terminal? Without much info its difficult to know why it did not open for you.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
At the time of the open it was a valid buy and at the time you were looking at it it had reversed due to AUD news.

I have said in the first post that this strategy does not account for weekly news events, they can go either way and in the case of this pair it reversed.

Hi, guys,..any one testing the ea in xm,..????

Im testing the ea in xm,.but no  trades,.always get the message,..TRADING IS DISABLED,..i checked evrything 20 times,.i dont see where is the problem,.its driving me mad,..rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,..because i put on the same mt4 diferent eas, all them work ok,..not this one,.

I am also studying the idea of closing trades after 7-9 of open trades.i av being studying it since last week as well and 2weeks in a round the results has being great..though am still studying it.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
This strategy being weekly and automated is relaxing, if it will turn out to be profitable in the long run too it would be fantastic.

Nevertheless also fully automated strategies need some sort of control and this morning when I checked my VPS I saw that my EA didn't open any trade returning annoying common error from MT4.

Since I'm testing the overall code + system itself I changed the opening time setting it to 10:45 on a GMT+2 broker.

It opened 21 trades and closed the basket after 1 hour and 5 mins at +2.81% on trailing.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Do you have any symbol suffix? (i.e. from EURUSD to EURUSD.usd) or (i.e. from EURUSD to EURUSDi) if you have, you need to add that suffix to each pair in the settings ... in my case this was the problem. I hope this solves your problem

Hi mrdfx,

thank you for the System. I tried it the first time today and so far the result Looks good. Will watch it and update the thread with my numbers.

Additionally I have one Question:

Primary it´s fine, that a System seems to work. I the second stage I would like to understand it :-)

Can you help me understanding what the indicator "...LuxIng_Mod.." does?

I am not a coder, for this reason the source file doesn´t help, because I don´t understand it.

Maybe anyone can explain the function of the indi?

Thank you all and green pips

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi guys,..please can same one explain how the imput,.. use risk % of account,... works,.

I have select,..TRUE,...and put 10% risk,..but the orders always open with the value of  lot size,..doesnt mater what i put in risk%,.the orders always open with fixed lot size,..

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Nice! You opened 1 hour later and had some different pairs which seemed to work well in your favor.

Like I said on first post we can experiment on different open times to find an optimal time.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Bullilulli, the indicator simply looks at the current candle if it is bullish (green) or bearish (red) that's it.

We are checking at a specific time of day for the confluence of the higher time frames to follow the main trend of the pairs.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi ppwest, can I ask how come your showing lot size 0.25 yet above it says 0.01/200, do not understand?

Tony

--- 帖子 #209 ---
0.01 per $200 balance, so $5000/200 = 25, so lot size is 0.25.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
lol on $200 balance i enter with 0.2 lot ussual on 1:500 leverage

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I noticed you had set opening time to 3 I just thought with the USD daylight time shift which changes my broker time from +3 GMT to +2 GMT I would adjust opening time to 4 which is 2 am GMT  It is also one full 4 hr candle on my broker.

its possible an imput to open trades and close on any day of the week ??

How do I get the EA to use a percentage of my account for the risk?

I've set the "Use Risk % of Account" to true, and set the Risk % to 1.0, and the balance is £38k, but it submitted trades of only 0.01 lots...

i was talking with mrdfx about that,..he said its a bug in that imput

Hello artic118,

It seems that there may be a small bug with the risk % lot size calculations. I'll get it fixed and upload it. In the mean time use fixed lot. Cheers.

Thanks, I missed that.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
This is the result for this week:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

All settings are default with the exception of TP sets to 10% and SL to 5%. The reason why the total basket is 36.39 instead of 30.00 because I closed the EA to manual trade other accounts. I have to re-opened the EA every time I check for this account and when I re-opened the account, the total basket has exceed 10% thus it closed as it is.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
You can set the EA to open on any day you want, but the close time is set to Friday which is the day to close if TP or SL have not been hit.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Yup picked up a small bug with the risk % for lot sizing. I've asked my friend to take a look and get it fixed for me. Its normal to pick up some small bugs here and there for a new EA, but all will be fixed up shortly.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
mrdfx

Am I correct in assuming that if the mt4 session where the EA is operating must be kept ON as there are NO hard SL/TP?

The EA must be ON all of the time?

I think we need to have back test for this strategy, I just created an EA for backtesting on single symbols , if you have tick data on your mt4, please back test the EA and copy the results here to see which symbols works best . the EA works on UTC time ( it opens position 4 AM on Tuesday ) you can change it if your tick data is from various time frames .

--- 帖子 #229 ---
The strategy is working fine and we just need to find the best settings for TP,SL,BE and TS .

Hi mrdfx,

have you ever thought to launch the bot again, e.g. on Wednesday in case like this one that target is hit quickly ?

Not an invitation to be greedy, just a though.

Best regards,

Bubincka

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi vivaldi2,

I think back test is a good idea.

However since this strategy operates on basket the ideal would be to run it on 28 pairs simultaneously to know more about the best overall global SL and TP and at which hour/minute of the day to start it.

As far as I know multi-pairs back test is possible only with MT5.

Best regards,

Bubincka

it could be an isolated episode, I'm too with icm (demo) and on Tuesday this week at 03:59 my EA didn't open any trade returning MT4 common error, signalling icm demo server unavailability. On previous week, same broker, EA and time trade were opened regularly.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I was using a slightly higher lot size this week than 0.01/$200 as the EA used the fixed lot size instead of risk %. This is getting fixed and should be sorted by the weekend.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Hi bubincka, I haven't actually. I also don't like to be greedy, but it is an idea that we can test sure.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Thankyou.

I'm a coder myself, and out of curiosity, I'm keen to understand how you're going to calculate the lot size to use based on an account balance, but without any stop size.  For the calculation, do you assume a risk of 10 pips? 100?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi bubincka,

I don't understand if its an isolated episode or not. I failed with icm. So I am having my test run with my pepperstone account. Its working fine with them.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I'm no coder so I don't know how my friend calculated it but I can ask him. I only asked him for this option in the EA and he did it, how I'm not sure.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
No worries - as I said, I was just curious.  Hopefully it will all become clear with the update.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
still without any negotiation and also can not configure the table ...

why not open positions?

I already changed the hours and nothing

thanks

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Just for info... i've started my demo at 12am this morning.. 21 pairs opened and just close by SL....

I know that's not the right time...but i would test Ea..

Thanks

Regards

Looks like the symbols from your broker have a suffix.  You need to update the list of pairs to have the same name as the pairs provided by your broker.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Great, thanks

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Great Job, this is amazing wao you got it too simple and clear no confusion no drama this tread proffers the right solution to forex trading without heart attacks and head aches, Thanks Mr.dfx you have done a great job.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
You are 100% correct.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I've realized that some might think this strategy to be boring as its a weekly strategy and only trading 1 day of the week. Most traders like to trade daily and think if they only trade once per week its not enough to make profit.

I've set my TP to 5% and if we win every week that's 20% pm which is very good for me personally. 20% compounded throughout the year is over 700% profit! Now we will probably have some losses along the way, but still make a good profit in the end.

What I really like is the simplicity of the strategy and that you don't need to invest so much chart time and effort to trade it. You free to trade your other strategies that you trade daily and you can still make a good monthly profit on the side.

Traders need to change their mindsets and psychology when they approach trading. You don't need to be in the market all the time, find a strategy that puts less stress and time in your trading, have patience and realistic expectations of how much you want/need to make. Once you get that you'll understand the potential of this strategy. :-)

--- 帖子 #252 ---
On another note this strategy is pretty adaptable thanks to the EA. You can change which time frames you want the EA monitor and open times so you can experiment with trading on different days, time frames, and open times.

I'm busy experimenting with a daily approach that IF successful can be traded everyday for added weekly profits. Its still early days but if its successful I'll share my findings and results.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I totally agree with your post.

The only problem is that if your trade with a 10% stop, then a losing week will burn 2 winning weeks, and that's scary.

How many times will this happen? Who knows.

The difficult side of this work is to find the right risk/reward ratio.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
As we trading a basket of pairs that can range up to 20+ pairs depending on their trends we need to allow "room to breath".

If we set a lower SL it could be too tight. When trading a basket of pairs its normal for pairs to swing so to accommodate that we set a wider SL.

The 10% SL and 5% TP are my personal weekly targets, of course you don't need to use the same, you can experiment with your own risk parameters and targets.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Thank you, mrdfx i will give it a try .

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Thank you mrdfx for sharing of this strategy. Final result of this week:

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Agree.

If only we could back test this weekly strategy for 28 pairs simultaneously it would bring important info on which is the best Hour & Minute to open the basket.

Given that Tuesday is the right day to start, I think the right time is still an open question.

Has there been any progress fixing the Lot/% bug.

I started week with account of 8600, opted for 5% but EA used 0.01 Lot.

I ended week £0.27p up.

Here is MT5 EA version attached. Please tell me if the algorithm is ok according to this thread?

You can use reverse logic as well - by parameter is_retrace_mode setting to true.

Please share the best backtesting results.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Made some random backtesting and one completed optimization for DJI30 - see optimization results attached (3 years, real ticks).

Seems there can be found good opportunities. Believe there can be combinations of multiple symbols as well - will continue optimizations. Saw promising results with DAX as well (see attached Excel) - will run an optimization on DAX too.

Please post here other optimizations as well - have to spend several hours on 1 optimization so if we will do it together then we will get wider opportunities to split investments for several baskets (EA setups).

A lot of work must be done here - please join backtesting and publish your results. Together we can do it!

--- 帖子 #263 ---
tried to do backtesting and got unsupported filling mode. I am using ICMarkets MT5. any idea?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
By mistake found better DJI setups... I set in tester DAX but in EA settings forgot to change symbol and so left with DJI.. as a result I have got different optimization results for DJI (see attachment).

Compared the best result in 2nd optimization Excel and see that it is missing in 1st one. MT5 strategy tester chooses testing scope according to some rules. Ok, I am using the option "Fast genetic based algorithm" and not "Slow complete algorithm".. that's the reason?

wait for a bit.. hmm.. idea: strategy tester was executed on DAX ticks (EA uses function onTick) but with DJI data.. maybe this gives some impact.. actually.. so you set up EA on DAX chart but set in parameters to track DJI prices. onTick will execute with DAX ticks.. interesting...

you can see in Excels attached differences when the same EA parameters for DJI executed on DAX ticks or on DJI ticks.. quite a big difference when SL2 and TP2 case.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Seems there are different default allowed filling modes for each broker (https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constan...l_filling_mode). I'm using Admiral Market and Roboforex and my n EAs works fine and I don't specify that parameter when executing deals operations.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Finally, have got DAX optimization results (8h running) - see attached.

And here is set up with combinations of DAX and DJI (5 EAs on 1 account) - different days and/or different SL/TP to diversify risks:

1) DAX - day 1, hour 15, SL 42, TP 22, lots 0.1

2) DAX - day 1, hour 15, SL 3, TP 9, lots 0.3

3) DJI - day 5, hour 6, SL 20, TP 20, lots 0.1

4) DJI - day 5, hour 11, SL 38, TP 26, lots 0.1

5) DJI - day 2, hour 14, SL 2, TP 2, lots 1 (on DAX chart must be executed)

In ~3 years profit ~3000 USD. Starting balance 1000 USD. Profit ~100%/yearly. But here is no swaps/dividends included in backtesting. It should be less profit, therefore.

Here calculated balance (not equity!) drawdown of all 5 combinations:

2016-08-09 18:04 - 2016-09-15 18:28 down 108 from 1062 was up 62

2017-06-20 09:03 - 2017-06-29 19:00 down 108 from 1655 was up 700

2018-07-24 17:21 - 2018-08-10 10:00 down 139 from 2900 was up 1353

2019-09-12 02:24 - 2019-10-22 21:50 down 103 from 4067 was up 1306

According to courses from my broker which I attended - backtesting drawdown in real life could be 2x more and profits 2x less. So that's what we can expect here: ~50% yearly profits with ~30% drawdown. Fully automated. Think that's not bad only for 2 symbols combination but here can be found much more - need more time.

But yes - here is 1 dealbraker.. according to courses must be at least 700 deals to consider statistics. What do you think? Will you give a try to this setup with real money?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
fix: 5) DJI - day 2, hour 14, SL 20, TP 20, lots 1 (on DAX chart must be executed) - because we multiple 0.1 by 10, and SL/TP is in money in this EA so x10 too

--- 帖子 #268 ---
fix: 2) DAX - day 1, hour 15, SL 9, TP 27, lots 0.3

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hello guys, ok we have fixed up some minor bugs with the EA.

As it turns out it is impossible to calculate lot size using risk % without having a set SL, and as this is a basket with no set SL it can't be done (I thought it could) so it has been replaced by a lots per balance instead. Now you can choose the lot size based on the account balance which I think will work well in place of risk %.

We also fixed some things with the trailing stop as it was not working correctly and small bug in how the current profit/loss was displaying on the dashboard. hopefully now all is good and we can have another profitable week!

First post also updated!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Will the lot size be spread between how many trades need to be opened by the EA or will it open all the trades at the position size input?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
What works fine in Demo market does not always world fine in Live market and therefore must be tested there also? Who will invest in that test? furthermore the level of investment being used is influencing the test result, meaning that if your lost size is minimal say 0.01 you should expect a different reaction from your broker when your lot size goes to 0.10 never mind 1.0

The question is who is going to invest in those live tests.

Eas are good ideas but People must understand that the Brokers and market makers simply wont let them work against them.

Your best bet is to design something that is semi-automatic that you can control after clearly spotting the trend.

Even then you must tighten control over the bot to ensure that the brokers and market makers dont send out opposite signals before pushing live trade in other direction. Or flood the bot with high volume of transactions to get you into over trading zone!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
tnx for remarks. that's true about market makers brokers. but is it relevant to ECN brokers/accounts as well?

anyway seems I missed out on the topic of this thread and my posts here are misleading from author purpose. sorry about that. please delete my posts from here if possible.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
The EA will calculate the lot size for each individual pair according to the total account balance so for example if I set 0.01/$200 and my account is $1000 then the EA will open all pairs with 0.05 lots.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Will this work in micro account? I use JustForex with 500 leverage and I can put in 10-20$ USD = $1000-2000 cents

Let me know, I'll live test this for the team.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I have not tested on a micro account but I don't see why it should not work successfully. The EA has no restrictions except an expiry date which I update monthly.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
It works with micro account.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
hi, thank you mrdfx for updated EA. today i was testing scalping setup of this strategy in lower TF. i encountered with MT4 crash and received this message:

EDIT: this happened only once today when Use Lots Per Balance was enabled and EA was trying to open trades.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hmm interesting thanks I'll ask my friend to take a look and see why that happened and get it fixed.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
HI , Plz guide how do i change, my account balance 1400$

get 5%

tnx

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I think the main issue johny is that many here can hardly understand your point. You may need to break down your trade in a way people can relate with and attempt to try out.

It appears quite complicated.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Firstly you using an old version so update to the latest version on page 1.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I am also consufused, can someone show what the settings should be on the new version EA

--- 帖子 #283 ---
There's nothing confusing. Run the EA on default settings, the only thing you need to change is the lot size appropriate for your account balance.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Guys I picked up a small bug with the lots per balance calculation. Please don't use it! Use ONLY fixed lots for now until I can get it sorted and release an update!

--- 帖子 #285 ---

What time did you start your basket? Started mine at 4 and is still running.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #291 ---
3am.  My broker is GMT+2, so this would have been 1am GMT.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
ur lot size is big enough in respect of available balance , that why 5% target hit faster than us

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Who is your brooker,.???,..and your leverage, to open 32 lots in a 2234 account balance,..

Any particular reason for opening your basket at 3am,..??? because if you follow the rules you have to open at 4am,.that is when your first 4h candle close.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Are you sure you read the first post carefully?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
You're right,...SORRY GUYS

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Broker is GlobalPrime.  Leverage is 50:1.  Account balance was 40,200 GBP.

I set the EA to use 0.1 lots per 1000 USD.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
If you use 0.1 lots per 1000 balance (the default) in future, your trades should close just as quickly.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thanks, so just for my understanding...

My IC Market broker is a GMT+2 broker, what should be the right basket start time for basket open? Taking into account the clock change / 1 hour back we went earlier in the month.

3 or 4?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I simply used the default of 3.

I also use IC Markets for my live account, and will probably move the EA across to it once I'm happy with the results, and will most likely use the defaults as the chart times are the same for both brokers.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Some of you keep mentioning GMT, but GMT time is not relevant as we are trading candles (broker time) not time zones.

Some of you might have brokers who use NY close as the EOD and some brokers don't, but it doesn't matter as we are trading the new daily candle which every broker has, now of course depending on your broker and data feed there might be some differences in which pairs are validated and that is completely normal.

My basket is still running and in a little DD, but its still early in the week and has plenty of time to come around.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks, this answered another query that was niggling in my mind, on whether GMT actually mattered or not, thanks.

I will just simply stick to broker time regardless from now on.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I'm sorry, but GMT IS relevant.

Some (should I say "most"?) brokers are within 1 or two hours of GMT, so I agree that in these instances the offset should not make a huge difference - BUT there WILL be differences.  However, a broker which has a server time of GMT+6, for example, would start their daily candle a good four to eight hours ahead of other brokers, making the EA open orders way too early.

So yes, people DO need to take their broker's GMT offset into account.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
There is no way we are not gonna take GMT into consideration,there is no broker that does not observe day light savings... On my broker candle close has move from GMT to GMT+1

--- 帖子 #304 ---
This strategy is not dependent on GMT and never has been. I am looking at candles only and specifically the first daily close of the week.

Whether the GMT is +1 or -1 or if the broker is GMT +2 or +3 I am still looking at the first daily close of the week. If a broker changes their EOD time due to daylight saving etc, I will still open at the same time (EOD time +3) even if GMT had to change cos I'm not looking at GMT when opening my orders only the brokers EOD time +3.

There is no debating this, feel free to adjust your open times according to GMT if you want, like I said in the beginning we can experiment on different open times as the EOD time +3 hour rules is not set in stone, that is what I'm using for now, but it could easily change if we find a better open time.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I had no trades open today, could this have been the issue?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
So you mean if our initial EOD +3 is 1am and day light savings now apply,we should still open our trades at 1am instead of 2am ?Am just asking for better understanding.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Well, the strategy is dependent upon candles...candles are dependent upon the broker's EOD time...so timing CAN be important.

e.g.:

If a broker is GMT+2, then their daily candle closes at 22:00 GMT, so if the EA is set to open trades at 03:00, they will open at 01:00 GMT.

If a broker is GMT-2, then their daily candle closes at 02:00 GMT, so if the EA is set to open trades at 03:00, they will open at 05:00 GMT.

Unless I'm much mistaken, the disparity in the above scenarios mean that we cannot simply ignore GMT and use candles, because the results can, and will, be wildly different, depending on broker offset.  Hence, when someone asks me about my broker, I will often state the GMT offset so they can adjust their settings accordingly if they are on a different timezone.  I'm simply trying to be helpful to others here.

Personally, my broker is GMT+2, so I'm comfortable (for now) using the default opening of 03:00, because by this time, the Daily candle will have opened and the first H4 candle will also be open (but not yet closed), but the higher timeframes of W1 and M1 will give the overarching trend.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
According to my understanding of the rules, the candles of the time frames are the current candles. Current candles are not closed -- when people refer to the "close" price of the current candle that really means the current Ask price -- i.e. the most recent tick.

The only price that is carved in stone is the Open price -- this is the first tick of the specified time frame. And the arrival time of that first tick IS determined by the broker's server GMT time. The "Trend indicator_LuXingMod_AUD" shows the delta (i.e. difference) between the Open tick and the current tick. Since the Open tick will most likely be different for server's at different GMT times then the delta will also be different.

That is -- everyone's current tick (for all time frames) will probably be very close. However, the Open tick for server's at different GMT will be different. Hence, the delta between Open and Ask will be different. Hence, the colors could be different.

By the way -- the ticks for all time frames are EXACTLY the same -- with one exception, the Open tick. All time frames receive exactly the same tick data -- the only difference is that M15 is guaranteed a tick every 15 minutes, whereas H1 is guaranteed a tick every hour. All there are are ticks -- bars (and candles) are an artificial construct to compress data for our viewing pleasure. I wouldn't get so hung about about candles...

I think this is correct -- however, I'm wrong about 50% of the time...

--- 帖子 #309 ---
i think the results should not be too different in long term. the main concept of this strategy says to wait for first daily close of the week... that's it. simply follow the rules and don't complicate it.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
What about adding the "virtual basket" to this approach?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thank you for your nonconstructive comment that added no value whatsoever to the thread.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
My broker uses NY close as EOD which is considered the market norm for the daily close (most brokers I think) which is currently GMT +2, however not all brokers use this as their EOD, so for those that are trading with brokers that have a different EOD time, and if they wanted to "trade the same"  as me then they can adjust the open time in the EA settings.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Not sure why it did not open for you but the lots per balance bug would not have affected the EA operation in opening trades.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Well you know I'm a fan of using VB and I think it could work, just need to figure out how to apply it to the EA.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Well, this strategy is basically the same as CCFp strategy so you might as well use it the same way. I too am a fan of the VB.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Picked up another bug which affected my open orders so can't get an accurate reading on this weeks results. Its frustrating when something so small affects the outcome. It does look like some of you had a successful week and that's great.

I'm working on getting some things fixed up with the EA and will get it uploaded before next Monday. Guys those of you using the EA you need to remember this EA is a new project and there's bound to be some small bugs that needs fixing. Make sure you only trading on demo and not real yet!

If you think you have found a bug or something not working please share as much info as you can so it can be replicated and fixed.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I think another method is for you to only trade what you can loose..Leave the basket when it is in lost till it swing back or leave it till Friday and close the loss..Am testing that one.People might think that's gambling..

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Great mrdx! I look forward to trying next week. Thanks for the update.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
this is the third week results that i tested this strategy. i opened and closed all trades manually this week. Based on what i saw in this 3 week, i think i can have a consistent and safe profit of about 2% with about 5~6% DD per week without stress of 10% stoploss hitting if i consider a proper lot size per balance. but for 5% profit per week, i think it needs more room for price to move and thus more DD%.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Actually that's already part of the strategy like I mentioned in post #222.

If the basket did not hit TP or SL by Friday we will close regardless if in profit or loss. There's no holding orders over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
What am saying is my basket  hit the stop loss  and the draw down was 50% on Wednesday afternoon.I left it and on Thursday, i was up 100 pip so i closed the basket.What am saying is, since we are targeting 5% profit with so many currency pairs in the basket we must allow Draw down for a swing hence the 10% SL is too tight .I will try the 2% target profit and see how it works.After 30 minutes when i entered trade, 2% target profit hit before the trade took a nose dive.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
2% Profit hit.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
how about eliminating pairs with negative swap? Or, at least the worst of those pairs.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I agree, 2% profit per week is enough - its more than is needed to double your account year on year. And a low DD is more acceptable psychologically.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I like some of the principles in this strategy idea -its simple, and therefore time-efficient and not error-prone its objective, not reliant on individuals' chart artistry or recognising Rorschach patterns its not just an entry pattern it focuses on being in positions rather than getting in the key is the profits, not the individual charts success comes from being in trends, trading pattern No.1

I'm lined up to trade my own variant on this from tomorrow night.

So far my visual backtesting suggests there is rarely any significant advantage to holding wining positions after the Thursday close - anyone confirming that in practice?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Just closed last weeks basket with +5 usd profit today

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thats exactly what happened last week to me. The basket was closed at Friday 20.0 as expected. I'm only wondering why the valid pairs (signals) are different from yours. I had 11 pairs in basket instead of 9 (yours). Below is the trade report in my demo account. The basket is opened 3 hours after the 1st daily close candle of the week...

--- 帖子 #337 ---
My experience with this strategy tells me,..if the basket open on thuesday 3am go in profit until wensday morning 10 am,.close the trades because you dont get better than that,..if the basket on thuesday when open go in negative,.on wensday morning he will reverse and start going in profit,..wait until thursday morning 10 am and close,..

Max profit always came in wensday morning our thursday morning

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Opened a basket later Sunday evening and it closed with 2% profit. Yahooo. Will try to open another basket this evening.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Guys I'm still waiting for my friend to fix the bugs I picked up last week.

In the mean time if you do use the EA tonight, make sure to use fixed lot not lots per balance, and do not use trailing stop. Alternatively you can still trade tonight manually.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
So I mentioned a little while back that I'm busy testing a setting that can be traded daily and its based mainly on trading the London session momentum.

Initial testing is going well so far and if all continues to go well over the next few weeks I'll share the settings.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
An issue which might eventually become a problem for me -

I'm trialling a system very parallel to this basket principle starting tonight. Right now I see 22 of a possible 28 pairs for which I can set entry orders. I am using minimal position sizes (spreadbetting, UK) so margin is not going to be an issue for me at this stage. However, going forward, if I want to increase position size I might run into margin issues because of a number of factors.

Firstly, the anticipated margin is not shown on orders, only actual margin on open trades, so its hard to see easily how much your margin exposure will be in advance.

Secondly, in the UK we're on ESMA margin limits - 1:30 for majors, 20 for Australasian.

Thirdly, the firm's T&C's specifically prohibits the setting of multiple orders, for the total of which you don't have enough margin. Not that all the orders are likely to be triggered but that's the rules.

Anyone else running into these obstacles?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Looks great mrdfx thanks, can you comment if there are any open positions

Blam

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I'm with Global Prime in the UK, with a leverage of 1:50.  I am using this EA with a lot size of 0.01 per £100 and haven't run into any margin issues.

Forget Ts & Cs - if the platform accepts an order then it's legit - if they impose those rules, then the platform will stop you from placing additional orders once your limit has been reached.

Personally, I would steer clear of spread betting as it's not a true trading environment, and the broker has a vested interest in you losing, possibly hence why you have all of those rules imposed on you.

No open orders Blam. This setting trades daily and is in and out within a cpl of hours normally. Well lets say so far its been like this.

*Updated the pic to show accordingly.

This week's basket is live with 13 pairs.

So far its off to a rocky start currently floating around -3% after the first 1.4 hours. Its still early and plenty of time to come around.

Hi guys!

And thanks for the Mrdfx system.

Opened 14 pairs per test.

10% SL Hit

14 Trades opened

Lot size 0.01/200

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Ouch well that went fast! SL hit. Unfortunately not a good week guys.

I am experimenting with different opening times now as I do think we can optimize when to get into the market and perhaps my "not set in stone" time of 03:00 is not the most optimal time.

On a good note at least my friend is working on the bug fixes so that should be sorted this week and the daily setting test hit its TP again today.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Yep an hour later isn't performing well either ☹

From next week I'll try an earlier time on Monday

Wensday morning they will start reverse and by thursday morning they are in profit,.i dont put stop lose

Looking at my worst performer so far, GBPAUD.
Attached Image

In relation to rule: 4. The previous H4 is green, but if we are going to open basket at 0300hrs next day (Tuesday Morning), we may as well wait for the H4 to fully form. The EA can then run a final confirmatory check to see if the candle has closed below or higher than the previous candle. Alternatively we can open the basket at 0000hrs. Just my observations.

The same appears to be the case for AUDCHF, but the opposite direction. If we waited until 0400hrs to open the basket, we would have seen that the candle changes and closed above the previous close, thus invalid signal and no open trade.

This is USDCHF, the only pair that is in the green. Here you can see that the H4 (at 0400hrs) candle closed in the green, and acts as a further confirmation.

Ultimately, if we are going to wait until the H4 candle has 'almost' formed, we may as well wait until it's fully formed and trade based off that.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I can only go along with the negative reports above re this week's trades. My first time toes dipped in the water and so far its not looking too good.

A couple of fine detail questions. Suppose I put in 10 pending orders based on the Monday NY close. Suppose 6 are triggered: I assume the plan is to run these 6 until they either hit the basket loss limit or I close them out Thursday/Friday. Likewise, I assume I need to keep the 4 pending orders remaining but cancel any whose charts show they've lost their trends.

But is it worth watching the charts of the open trades? Should they be cut if they lose trend or just left to run regardless?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Perhaps a VB would have kept you out of this weeks trades?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
tomorton, you seem to be thinking of this strategy in very different way. There is no pending orders and we don't know how many valid pairs there will be for the week. Please the first post again to be all clear on the strategy.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Possibly I just need to figure our how to apply it and then get it done, but it could work I think.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Ah, you're right of course. I was making it more complicated than necessary by setting entry orders ahead of price. Many thanks mrdfx, situation is clearer.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi MrdFX, I must commend your selfless effort and service to ensure that people are profitable  using your beautiful system. I am currently investigating  on how to apply the system for daily trading. I am already making some great moves.

I really want you to understand that there is nothing wrong with your system or proposed entry time. From my wealth of experience using your system I want to explain what happened in the trade this week. On sighting the situation I already knew it was going to be bad for those trading.

The problem was that many traders did not factor a major news report for the AUD that was to open 30mins after your proposed entry time. I took advantage of the situation after I realized the direction that the news took AUD and that made me very profitable.

This is the secret everyone trading this beautiful system must know. If there is Major News for AUD within the timing, wait to ascertain the direction based on the news as AUD can be very volatile.

From experience, any thing that affects AUD makes NZD go in the same direction. Therefore, if the news makes AUD rise, NZD will definitely rise (go same direction). If AUD falls NZD also falls. They are directly proportional.

If you are in doubt of what I am saying, look at all the trades that made losses. you will realize that the losses only affected currency pairs that involved either AUD or NZD while the other pairs were profitable. This proves again that the system is ok but was only affected by the volatility of AUD following the news in the forex calender at about 12.30am GMT.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi kefmawin, thank you for the kind words. :-)

I have previously mentioned that this strategy does not account for high impact news and if you see that there is upcoming news you can filter out those pairs that could be affected.

Personally I have not done it as HIN can go either way, its a 50/50 chance that you can profit from the news or take a loss like this week.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
That is correct. Thanks once again. No for sure that your system is profitable. I am also exploring it further.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Happy to say that I kept all my open positions in the basket running in this my first week and now I'm in real danger of making a small profit! The worst unrealised loss I saw on Tuesday was about -0.9% (aiming to get out at -1% during the trial period). Most of that loss is now eliminated and I reckon by tonight I should be in the money a little. Looking forward to running this again (and better) next week).

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Well from my testing it is, I would not have shared something on a public forum unless i was sure it works.

Just cos we had a loss here or there does not mean the strategy does not work, its impossible to have only wins.

Can this strategy be improved and fine tuned? Sure I think it can like any strategy can, and I think that through forward testing various set ups we will find an optimal setting that will make us a good long term profit.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi mrdfx,

I think your strategy is based on a good and solid idea, namely M/W/D + H4 periods.

The weak point according to me could be the starting hour on Tuesday.

Why you picked 3:00 and not 7:00 or anything else ? Is your initial choice based on back test performed on all the 28 pairs ?

And if yes how long did you go back in time ?

Unfortunately MT4 doesn't allow multi-pair back test while MT5 does.

Is there anybody here testing this strategy on MT5 that could do a real test going back at least 5 years ?

Best regards,

Bubincka

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I'd be surprised to hear of much price action on most pairs between the NY close and the London open which might affect this strategy. The exception would be AUD and NZD pairs if there has been some high impact national or regional news.

As for the other currencies, yes, a change of entry time might make for a different price but surely the probability of a universally worse entry price isn't likely? Surely 50% of entry prices might be a little better with a different entry time but 50% might be expected to be a little worse?

Or do you have other factors in mind that might be relevant?

(please excuse me jumping in all)

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hi tomorton, far from me to have any ready made answer.

I was only raising some doubts on entry hour since it's the only param we can control.

On the other hand forward testing it isn't a valid alternative in my view since it's a strategy trading once a week and it should take too long to collect meaningful data. As said we could at least try to perform a back test on MT5 that afaik allows for multi-pairs simultaneous execution. That's why I was asking if there's anybody around trading this strategy on that platform.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi Joyny, I thinks it is an unkind and uncharitable statement to make. In my opinion, the author of this thread has done tremendously well and proven to be generous, open minded and sacrificial. Quite a number of people including myself have benefited from his system.

I do not even trade with the EA, I simply apply the initial manual approach he proffered and it has so far been profitable for me. He has given us enough to apply our discretion and trade profitably.

I am sure he is not planning to sell anything But even if he chooses to sell any EA in future, I will not have any issue with that considering he has committed a lot already in this project and deserves to be appreciated in several forms including monetary.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Where did I say or imply anything that I plan on selling this EA?

Who said an MT5 version is not welcome? What are you smoking?

I have no intentions of selling anything ever, your comment is uncalled for and will be disliked accordingly.

You clearly don't know my history on this forum or you would never have come with such a statement.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi bubincka, as I said in the first post I was testing this strategy for 3 months, actually its a bit longer cos there were some weeks I did not trade as I was not around my PC to trade for that week, but I compiled 3 month of data before deciding to share the strategy here.

When I initially started testings this strategy I wanted to wait till the first daily candle of the week closed, I also wanted to wait to see what the first H4 candle of the new day was doing to get a sense of the trend momentum before choosing valid pairs.

As I was trading this manually, some weeks I opened before 3 hours and some after 3 hours and from that I kind of decided that 03:00 was the go between hour to start. I have said that this open time is not set in stone and everyone is encouraged to experiment different open times to perhaps find a better start time if there is one. I'm currently testing some different open times and hopefully after a few weeks I will have more data on that to share.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
You wrote in 1st page this: I have put a 30 day expiry on this EA to protect it from being sold or commercialized etc. At the end of 30 days I'll upload a new version.

Friendly question: what will be "at the very end" - forever 30 days updates from your side?

I am friendly and sharing. Don't what to harm here anybody. When you read the text you don't feel emotions or smile in my face

Ok if that was all my mistaken perception then let's try the MT5 path!

I posted on page Nr. 14 MT5 EA and backtesting results. I asked the question - is my EA according to this thread algorithm (it is important because maybe I made mistake - people should use only correct EA according to this thread). As nobody answered (even moderator of this thread) I decided that MT5 is not welcomed here. But ok it's my mistake.

Backtesting history is very important. You can save so many time to people if backtest history with MT5 EA. People here need to earn some money.. why wait 3 years in forward testing if you can backtest history and get so important answer - "is this strategy working" ?

I found that this strategy works (if I didn't make mistake - please confirm If my EA works correctly) with each symbol individually because each symbol has an individual "best times" for opening. Don't believe in basket idea because 3 months backtesting was bad (sorry didn't save results as I save only good results and didn't intend to post here anything till saw people asking for MT5...).

I can make backtesting of the "basket" version again if somebody confirms that my EA is correct.

For now, attaching backtesting results for 10 "winners" of this strategy (but an adjusted strategy with reversals too) - backtested 10 years.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Not a bad ratio tho...having  a good entry time of the week should better the result in the long run.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
This will be my last post directed at you as I'm not into debating or arguing with anyone. You came into my thread posting false statements that I have commercial intentions which you still have not retracted or apologized for.

The 30 day expiry is exactly that, to prevent this EA being commercialized, how that translated in your head to meaning I plan on selling it is beyond me.

You seem to be making many assumptions, where did I say that an MT5 version is not welcome? Exactly what you said, you decided. I don't trade MT5 and have no way to see how or if your version is correct, I also never replied to you as you were going off topic and deviating from the original strategy, you even say you don't believe in basket trading, then what are you doing here???

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi Mrdfx, I do not want you to be distracted by unkind remarks from people. Just keep your focus on the good work you are already doing. Some of the comments people are making have proven to me that we have people who have "entitlement mentality" and an attitude of ingratitude.

Once again, you have availed a good system that can be applied in various ways for profit making. For this week I made great experiment applying the indicator you provided without The EA and traded daily. Guess what? I made over 100% profit. I know its unbelievable but that is the case here.

I can tell for sure that a lot of people are looking for who will spoon feed them rather than tweeking the system already freely delivered for optimum profit.

Cheers...

Happy Sunday guys I hope you are all enjoying your weekend! :-)

So we finally managed to sort and fix some minor bugs this week!

V1.2

1. The lots per balance input is now fixed and working correctly.

2. The trailing stop is now fixed hopefully. (Still need to be tested further, but it should be fine).

3. Fixed a small misprint in the comments field.

4. Fixed a minor bug in the display panel.

Well that's what has been picked up so far and fixed. Please test it guys and if you pick up anything funky let me know!

Have a great week of trading guys!

First post also updated!

Add the suffix to each of the pairs in the list in the parameters.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Same.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
i think you should find optimal lot size per balance to decrease probability of SL hitting against a reasonable profit, because in this strategy the probability of market direction change and turns to profit or atleast lower loss during the week or at the weekend is very high. so you shouldn't miss this chance with early stoploss hitting. it's only my opinion...

did you try EA instead of indicator ?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Well damn there goes that one.

So it looks like the 03:00 basket was a bust.

Is anyone else experimenting with other open times?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I opened my basket just before the NY close. For convenience rather than any stronger reason.

I'm not using the software but trying to replicate the principles using charts and manual entries. I have a large basket - 17 positions - currently -1% but these are very small and my SL is -2%. So not a great start but too soon to bail.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Yep, open at 10:05 GMT today, only 5 pairs open, currently in slight profit.

I'll update once closed

Greetings to all... I have been following this thread for several weeks now. Forgive me please as I feel compelled to offer my 2 cents worth... And please also understand I mean absolutely no disrespect, but cannot help but ponder the following subjects, after which I would like to offer how I work this strategy - NO EA's!

Before I begin, let it be known that I fully understand that the goal of this strategy appears to be to pull a 5% profit each week without much work.

1. TREND TRADING - LONG TERM CHARTS... If a trader is wanting to trade with long term trends, as this strategy suggests by using monthly, weekly and daily charts, the likelihood of quick profits - in my opinion - is unsustainable. Monthly trends, weekly trends and daily trends WILL have countertrend moves. Allowing an EA to determine which currency pairs are trending and placing baskets of orders for short term profits seems - uhhhmmm - lacking a due diligence to a traders account.

Personally, I never let EA's do my work or my trading for me. EA's cannot pickup on the things that our eyes can. They can gather information, but cannot judge beyond the scope of what they have been programmed to do.

For example, an EA might determine that the AUDUSD is a buy, but cannot see that the RBA will lower rates Monday night... That same AUDUSD buy from the EA is not going to see a completed five wave impulse Elliott Wave to the upside... That same EA is not going to see the completed butterfly pattern to the upside... That same EA is not going to see the trendline break, it won't see the order flow, it won't see that volume is declining to the upside, it won't see the MA cross, it won't see the doji (indecision) candle on the weekly, it won't see the OB condition on your indicator... Etc Etc Etc - so why would you let it trade for you if it won't see things that may cause your trades trouble and cause your account pain?

SEE where I am going with this? I mean no harm, I want to help traders here see what work has to be done to make it successful for the long haul.

2. EA FOR EASY... If a trader desires easy money trading forex, that trader may not realize just how hard trading profitably on a long term basis forex can be. In fact, it is my belief that trading forex profitably for the long run is likely one of - if not the most - difficult professions known to mankind. We all want to find easy money - EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US wants that!

An info commercial at 3am on a Wednesday back in 2007 had me believing that trading forex was easy money... this is my true story by the way -

now 12 years later - IT REMAINS THE HARDEST JOB I HAVE EVER HAD... fortunately, my technical analysis background and new found understanding of order flow and volume have me on the right track.

I see posts of traders losing $500 / $1000 a week here on this thread - and they are "trading with the trend" ??????? Seriously????

that confirms that trading is not easy. I am of the belief that EA's just add to the difficulty.

QUESTION: Rather than donate to losses, how much technical analysis training will $500 / $1000 a week get you?

ANSWER: A busload.

3. TRADING WITH A BLIND 10% STOP LOSS... Seriously? Letting an EA determine and trade for you at a risk each week of a 10% stop loss on your account? That to me is insanity. An EA will never be able to determine the proper price level for a stop loss placement. Heck, for years I couldn't even figure out proper stop loss placement looking at the charts!!! -

I strongly recommend letting price tell you ideal areas for stop loss placement. let me repeat that...

LET PRICE TELL YOU WHERE TO PLACE A STOP LOSS. Look at the charts - see them clearly - like no EA can.

4. CURRENT CANDLES... Using the current monthly candle is ok for trend, except at the beginning of the month. Using a current weekly candle is questionable to me, especially on a Monday afternoon. The candle may not have had enough time to develop to see if it is going with the trend. I use the previous weeks candle as its trend is confirmed by its close. Using the current daily candle is also questionable to me - for the same reason - It has not had enough time to develop for me to see if it is going with the trend. I use the previous daily candle - Monday's closed candle. Its close confirms its direction. I do not use a 4H candle, but if I did - you guessed it - I would want to use the previous closed candle so I could see its confirmed direction.

Here is how I handle this strategy. MANUALLY. My charts are set up and I fill in the blanks on an excel worksheet every week for 28 currency pairs.

Starting with monthly, then weekly, then daily. It takes about 15 minutes to complete the basic analysis that the EA can do. Lets see what this week looks like:

Lets dig deeper at the 10 pairs to see if anything removes them from our list!1) NZDUSD - MONTHLY DOJI - OUT2) GBPCAD - MONTHLY DOJI - OUT3) GBPCHF - MONTHLY DOJI - OUT4) USDJPY - WEEKLY DOJI - OUT
That's a 2 minute candlestick analysis and I am now down to 6 possible pairs. Take some more time yourselves on these 6 pairs to see if anything else would have you eliminating any other pairs for the week.That's it for today. I hope this helps someone out there. I hope this will have you looking at your pairs this week and evaluating how much loss could have been avoided.

It's not easy to develop longterm profitable EA and it is possible to implement all kinds of geometry in EA for decision making. EAs can have the same "eyes" what you mentioned. But the main advantages of EAs:

1) Backtesting history

2) Optimization - find out the best parameters

3) Discipline - no emotions and 100% trading according to defined rules

You may have a lot of parallel EAs running (more than 100) on n accounts with various setups - manually you can forget something and make mistakes.

Anyway, I put like on your comment because there is truth in your words too

But the author of this thread is true too - profitable strategies can be simple. If statistics prove that - why overcomplicate?

I already run the modification of this strategy (backtested with 10 years data) on the real account. You can see it in my profile. So let's check this out after several months. Meanwhile, I continue optimizations because I found better setups on M15 charts. I will run them in a separate account. But need about 100 hours to backtest. You see - not so easy with EAs...

same here...still running...

--- 帖子 #404 ---
These are some good points. I for one have never and will never trade through an EA. Your point on taking note of the economic calendar is bang on the mark and too often ignored.

But the principle here appeals to my experience of all price charts in every class I have looked at - that long-term trending asserts itself more often than short-term counter-trending. It therefore follows that in an uptrend there will be more up days than down days, and vice versa in a downtrend. And they will be stronger up moves in an uptrend and stronger down moves in a downtrend.

Simplistic I know but statistically true. UNTIL - you get to the last counter-trend move, which can be dramatic and demands either a trade stop-loss or disciplined vigilance. But I only need to be right 6 times out of 11 to make money and continue to run the strategy (which are two separate criteria).

Also, the principle of using a basket of trend-following trades appeals to me as it automatically incorporates multiple positions on the higher probability pairs. Whenever looking at a new trade in forex, I am keen to see what the other pairs comprising the same currencies are doing and if most of the other 6 charts are adverse, I won't be going in. So, when the GBP is strong, the basket will automatically be overweight GBP.

I'm intrigued enough by the basket trade idea that I am exploring additional criteria for trade selection.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
My basket is close now due TP 5%

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Thanks for your feed back. I agree that EA's serve a great purpose in back testing, optimization and emotional-less trading... and I agreewith you that many traders are perfectly comfortable using them. I meant absolutely no disrespect to the thread author or any traders using EA's. In fact I respect very much the efforts - and even more so - the willingness to share - the systems, research and results.

I just meant to put a few thoughts out there as it looked (possibly) like a few traders were just jumping in and losing large sums quickly on trades that may need more than a couple of days to materialize, and hoped to point out that a good EA can still overlook some things that can cause account balance pain.

A very happy holiday season to you - and thanks again! -

PS: I put a like on your comment as well.

Cheers!

final result's of this week:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

EDIT: as you see DD% was 5.09% and P/L% was 2.35%, it means price went up to 2.74% negative (DD-P/L). as respects i considered about 0.01 lot per 1000$ balance for this week and according to my previous weeks results, i think if i consider 0.03 Lot per 1000$ Balance is th safest value and the chance of 10% SL hitting will be very low.

EDIT2: it was the first week that i tested 3:59 instead of 3 as open times of trades and the result was much better than previous weeks. so i continue with this open times for next week to see how it goes.

Ive read through the entire thread and was just curious if you guys are opening and closing your trades manually with the entry and exit rules in post 1 or are you still using the EA? Just asking because I saw where the EA has had some issues and didn't know if it still worked for the most part

Hello,

I just downloaded the EA from the first post. Is this EA still work or expired already on November 30th 2019?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #417 ---
If I've understood this system correctly there are some major principles at work here which might help guide traders -

1. find a strong trend from the chart and follow it

2. trend must be both long-term and short-term

3. follow all the strong trends, don't try to select just the best one

4. ignore individual chart TA once the position is open, just make trade decisions for the whole basket based on aggregated profit/loss

5. avoid holding through the weekend gap risk and Monday's ambiguous price action

I wonder if it would be relevant to add a sixth principle? -

6. prioritise the currencies with the greatest number of strong trends and take positions in those pairs based on these even if the individual chart TA would not indicate an entry - e.g. if GBP is strong, enter all GBP pairs, even if some are not individually selected at 1. or 2. above

Basket opened at 4:00 with 10 pairs via EA. I activated "Use Lots Per Balance" with 0.03/1000 Lots Per Account Balance. It Worked successfully.

+5% TP hit in a cpl of hours!

This is the kind of week I was waiting for!

--- 帖子 #426 ---
In the EA settings you can choose which day you want the EA to trade and you can set any open time you want to try.

Hello Traders, i have MEZ time zone, do I have to pay attention or which do you use?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi

I have a question. When your equity reaches +5%, you close all the trades or keep any trade alive? Similarly, when -10% drawdown from your equity, you kill all trades or just close some particular pairs?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
in my personal opinion, it's not important. just try different open time around 3 to 4 am in your broker time and see the results.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Now will you just quit for the week or will you try it again tonight?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Yes when my target TP is reached all orders are closed, the same goes for SL.

This strategy is treated like a basket of pairs and all orders are handled like a basket not individually.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Yes I am done for the week with this strategy, although you are welcome to experiment with other days and open times.

I am testing a daily setting but that will take many more months of forward testing to compile enough data.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
my basket is still running....with 14 valid pairs

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I was wondering why my basket didn't open

--- 帖子 #436 ---
5% a week? - a great week mrdfx, well done.

Actually I'm struggling a bit with the setting of SL and TP for this strategy. I have a basket open of very small equal-sized positions which is altogether equivalent to 15% of the margin available. My unrealised gain this week made +1%.

May I ask, what is the % of your account capital that you find you need to utilise per average basket to make +5%? And how often can a 5% profit be expected?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I had 14 pairs opened and hit the TP (5%)

mrdfx - thanks for your generosity of this EA.

Plz don't get me wrong - I'm not bitching - merely airing my observation about your "+5% TP hit in a cpl of hours!  This is the kind of week I was waiting for!"

I believe you (and some others) were "just lucky" this week - because of the Red News on AUD at 5:30 happen to go in your trade's favor. But 2 weeks ago the AUD Red News shortly after basket-open took AUD's and NZD's against our 3:++ trades-open (as Kefmawin said on Page 19). The Red News direction is a 50/50 gamble - where-as the purpose of any strategy is to get more odds in our favor, like 75-or-more : 25. And with 5% TP versus 10% SL, the odds of 50:50 are even more reduced.

...............So I opted to open basket this week 30min after the Red News last night - to see which way the wind blows. But it did'nt open - and I re-loaded the EA and re-set the time to when I looked again at 7:45, which then opened 14 trades (still running).

...............However, while the EA automatically adjusted the Lots as per setting 0.01/200 balance last week - this week it only used 0.01 Lots in a $4150 acc-balance with the same 0.01/200-balance setting.

Also - last week the EA did not close my basket at my setting of -20% SL (to give it more room) - most probably because I logged out of the account shortly after the basket opened, unwittingly canceling the EA. So the basket ran on to close at 5% TP on Wednesday (I think) while my acc was open to see whats cooking. Then I checked (calculated) how far the basket-pairs went further by Friday-late - and it would've gone to approx 14% gain by London-close on Friday.

.............So this week I set 10% TP (with 20% SL for more room) - but with only 0.01 Lots, I doubt it would reach 5% TP, let alone my test for 10% TP.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I must hold the record this week SL hit within 15 mins lol....almost 1% per min!!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #440 ---
As I understand it, the idea is to open trend-following positions on pairs which have established both short- and long-term trends. The odds of a trend continuing compared to the trend reversing are better than 50:50.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
hi, i have 2 question about your results:

1- are you sure open time of your basket was correct ? why 12:05 pm ?

2- what was the basis of your lot size selection ? 0.01/1000 or 0.01/200 or ... ?

thank you

--- 帖子 #442 ---
tuxTrader - you are correct with both statements, per se. But you might be missing my (and Kefmawin) point - that the short-term shot resulting from a Red News could go 50:50 in any direction, after you've committed with a basket open. Two weeks ago the AUD's Red News went against our committed basket, and took the NZD-pairs with it = bad-luck. This week the AUD Red News (and NZD-pairs) just so happen (50:50) to be in the same direction as the longer trend and committed basket = good-luck. Hence the idea to wait until after such early Red News before the basket could establish itself - and open the basket once the dust settled with more odds (no guarantee).

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Sorry tuxTrader - I replied to tomorton.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Broker time +2 GMT so 10:05 am 2 hours after London open.

Lot size 0.01/200

--- 帖子 #445 ---
i think open time of basket in this strategy doesn't need any calculation and this type of calculations is definitely a wrong approach. just simply try around 03:00 am to 04:00 am of your broker/server time for open time of basket. your open time (10:05 am or 12:05 pm) is the third or fourth H4 Candle of Tuesday not the first one that mentioned in first post! the fourth rule in first post confirms this:

and about lot size i think 0.01 lot per 200 account balance is very high and risky value that maybe brings you sometimes high profit but it increase chance of early SL hitting too. if you see your results on this strategy from previous weeks to this week, you had 3 weeks with 10% SL, 1 week with 5% TP and 1 week with 1.63% TP with this approach.

I hope you're not upset of my criticism

Regards

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Today result , again 5% tp hit

--- 帖子 #447 ---
There was no hard rule for opening times as stated by the OP hence why I wanted to experiment with different opening times.

The money management I used was the same as the OP.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
yes i know it's not hard rule but not as easy as shifting about 7 or 8 hours ! it's not hard rule for changing utmost 1 hour less or more. anyway it's my opinion, not OP and maybe i'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Please see attached a new version 1.3!

This version has the trailing stop fixed and has been tested working. This is now the most current and bug free version until someone picks up something funky happening lol. As always please test on demo first if you will use this EA until I have confirmed it is 100% working. Thanks!

Post 1 updated!

Hmmm so 83 downloads an 0% feedback or comments...

I guess everything is working fine then or nobody cares LOL.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Have you used EA's standard settings?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Thanks mrdfx! I feel it is very hard to backtest with MT4. And with one currency the performance seems to be too low. Could this be the reason? Perhaps it is not known how to use the EA. Do you use it on an hourly chart?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi,

Is there away of running EA of individual charts, so different TP and SL can be set.

Thanks

T

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I don't think there's any way to back test this is we base this on a basket of pairs not individually. There's also no real need to back test this I think, as the strategy logic is solid so forward testing in live market is the best solution.

I already have more than 3 months forward test data before deciding to post this publicly.

The EA is pretty simple to use if you understand the strategy and which chart time frame you use the EA on is not important as we are trading con-fluency of multiple time frames, the open hour is what is important.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Dear Mrdfx,

First of all, thank you for posting your Ea Follow the Candles. I am relative new here and to your post. I am going to test your EA as I found it extremely promising.

1 - Could you please confirm that once EA is loaded, it will run if conditions are met all the pairs within the EA - with no need to install it on each pair listed ?

2 - For instance, if I leave the setting day "Tuesday" it will run any positions from that day onward ? or just Tuesday ?

With appreciation,

David

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Consider punching your pairs (and directions in which you will trade them +/-) into this indicator to time your entries better. And yes, your coder can very easily work this indicator into your EA by simply timing the entry with the next change of candle colour of the built in HAS function, in the TF of your choice.

Cheers,

Lee

--- 帖子 #457 ---
You are on point my brother. When people fail to heed this simple warning on AUD Red News!, They do so to their own detriment. It is not even a subject for argument. Its a wise decision to factor it in our trade. Where such AUD Red news applies, simply trade available pairs without the AUD and NZD. Then watch the deviation of the the news figure from expected figure in order to ascertain the direction of the market in order to add them to the basket

Cheers

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I'm actually running this Monday to Friday. And checking at Friday close what the overall profit is

I've already hit TP today. I'm simply checking weekly to see if I'm up overall,bigger and better picture will obviously be monthly results and  an overall year profit. I've literally just set it it and forgot it with 1.3. all working as it should. Thank you

--- 帖子 #459 ---
This week's basket is live with only 6 pairs this week.

Lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I think the EA gives different pairs compare to the indicator you gave.Can i use the EA to see the pairs and trade manually?Is that possible?

Am waiting for your answer

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi, my basket is live with 10 pairs:

--- 帖子 #462 ---
My TP hit. But only had 7 pairs on my IC Market Demo, could of been a broker / demo difference.

Everything worked as expected. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #463 ---
The indicator and EA use the exact same code so there is no difference with the pairs between them.

It is not possible to use the EA to trade manually, it is an EA not an indicator.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I set up the EA to check the H1, H4, D1, W1 candles and I'm going to start it at the H4 candle after London Opens. On my broker the H4 candle ends 2 hours after London Opens. If I start the EA at the beginning of that H4 candle I will have 2 H1 candles that have formed after the London Opens. This should give me enough candles for a decent signal. The only issue that I'm having right now is toooo many signals. Too bad there isn't a way to detect trend strength and then have an input for "max trades" and have them in order according to their Trend Strength. I will continue to tinker and see if I can find another winning preset.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
+10% TP hit!

This week I increased the TP from 5% to 10% as I have started using the trailing stop. The trailing stop will start once the basket reaches +5% and trail by 1%.

This week was great and with only 6 pairs.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
So when you set the trailstop to start at 3% with a 1% trailstop.......does that mean that the SL will be moved to BE at 3% and then trail with a 1% trail at that point?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Yes correct that's how it works.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi mrdfx, thank you again for great work.

the new version works great without error. but as a request, is it possible to add recovery system to EA for when it has been removed/re-attached from/to chart, it detects opened orders by itself and manages them ?

--- 帖子 #469 ---
It's the sixth consecutive week with profit:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

thank you mrdfx

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hi tuxTrader, if the EA get removed for whatever reason and reattached the EA will pick up the orders and continue managing them if you use the same magic number.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
hey mrdfx

another successful week for me as well, thanks!

im trying to set up the tp/sl/trailling using the points feature. can you plase clarify  if the points metric being used is something like 10x pip value?

thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Hi blamshakk, points works pretty much the same as pips but in a smaller denomination, for example; 1 pip = 10 points, 10 pips = 100 points, etc.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hy and sorry for question...could be possibile and useful for future think to add a kind of portion balance or equities for Ea money management?

I mean for ex I've 100.000$ but I want use Ea just considering 1.000$ as balance and use lot size and tp and al related to that 1.000 portion...

Stupid idea?

Regards

--- 帖子 #474 ---
hi mrdfx, please check your pm.
thank you

--- 帖子 #475 ---
sorry for late reply, I just changed the trading time a few minutes which you can see in the pictures that I posted.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Thanks Mrdfx for the great ea,

I have been looking for better entries and so far what I have found is using weekly pivots as entry areas. If your Ea, says on Monday there is a good buy trade for instance, I wont enter right away. I will wait for price to come back below the weekly pivot on the 4 hour chart and touch any of the support levels and then enter long on the close of the candle as long as it hasnt broken and closed below that support. If it has broken and closed below the previous support then I look to enter on the next support level as long as the 4 hour candle closes above it after it has been touched.

Sometimes on the 4 hour chart price will close below that support level that it broke and then not reach the next support level. In this case, I would wait for price to close back above the previous support and then enter long  I thought maybe this would be easy to enter into the EA as it is a simple indicator and catches the retracements. Just an idea but seems to work well. Been testing it manually.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #477 ---
To add to what I was saying, you could also use the daily pivot and use the 4 hour entry the same way I have listed the the use of the weekly pivot. The daily may be better as the pivots are closer together and may get you in earlier then waiting for a deep retrace. Something to test and consider.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
This is a free pivots indicator that I use that was on FF, its not mine so please dont ask if I can change anything on it.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Does someone have a setfile or an explanation on how the settings work exactly? I am kind of confused.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi Tuxtrader..

Well done for your results so far..

Btw, what is you EA settings ?

Thanks..

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi. This is my settings, the rest is default:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Be Careful about "Use Trailing Stop" option. it has a bug in version 1.3, after enabling it, when you close and reopen MT4, the EA closes all opened trades automatically. It's OK if you don't close your mt4 or Simply Don't enable it yet. It's supposed to be resolved in the next release.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
hello  name indicator ? Thx

--- 帖子 #483 ---
TradeReport

--- 帖子 #484 ---
It also closes position if you reopen the expert and klick ok (without reopen MT4).

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I am unable to replicate this. Please make sure you have the latest version.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
And what broker do you use ?

Thx..

FXTM... but the results is not related to broker definitely. i described the most important factor here.

Hi  i have question  do you have or using SL ? yes/no how many pips

--- 帖子 #489 ---
My EA settings clearly answers your question...

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Having read this thread late, I thought I'd try it on a demo account last Thursday.

Out of 11 trades that showed up on Thurs, after NY opened, only 3 trades made losses by Friday, and that was because price almost reached my TP and turned back.

Used Weekly Pivots as TP points.

Just one day of tests, but perhaps really doable as a daily thing? Need more tests and confirmations.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Hey guys hope you all had a great weekend!

Please see attached a new version 1.4!

In this version we fixed a small bug where the EA would close active orders if/when the terminal was shut down or restarted, and if/when the EA was removed from the chart. This is now the most current and bug free version until someone picks up something.

As always please test on demo first if you will use this EA until I have confirmed it is 100% working. Thanks!

Well it certainly is a slow basket this week, currently floating around +22 pips profit. With only 4 pairs it might take time to reach TP, lets see how this week goes.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Four pairs for me too.

Good luck all and hopefully some movement by Friday.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi,

what happened?

great silence!

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Lol, it's Xmas mate. Most traders are taking a break.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
There are a number of reasons for that.

One, just like mallee said above, it's holiday time and just like myself I'm sure many members are taking a break and and spending more time away from the forums.

2ndly, this strategy is a weekly approach and I think for some its too slow and boring for them. The majority of retail traders like to trade daily and can't help themselves to stay away from the market, so to trade something that you do only once per week does not fit with their trading style, and that's fine. That being said I am testing a set up that can be traded daily but this needs more testing and I will continue forward testing in the new year.

3rdly, although this strategy can still be traded manually and originally it was, now we have an EA which does everything fully automated so there is no need to hang around watching the charts, it takes the stress of that away.

I used to be like those retailers and felt like I HAD to trade everyday, until I learnt the hard way that you don't need to trade everyday to be profitable, that's why I started changing things up and finding more longer term approach strategies like this one and the CCFp strategy that I like to trade.

Those traders who don't want to sit staring at charts all day will see the value in this approach. Trading is supposed to create more time freedom and this strategy helps to do that, its simple and it works period.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Well with 4 pairs it was a pretty uneventful week closing at nearly -6% for the week.

The basket did peak at around +3% on Wednesday but then took a dive thanks to EURCAD.

Well guys that's it for me, I am closing up all trading for the year and will continue again in 2 weeks on Monday Jan 6th.

Have a happy Christmas everyone and NYE, and see you all next year!

Hi All!

after several profitable weeks, a loss, which I think is a very good result.

Thank you mrdfx!

Happy Holidays.

A GOOD ADVICE:
stop trading on the 2nd week of December every year!!!!!!
BECAUSE:!
What you earn throughout the year, will be returned in December if you do not stop trading!!!
it is based on years of experience!!

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Does that loss continue throughout December and then resume upwards again in early January?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
No, i trade only on Forex Currencies Pairs

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hello guys and happy 2020!

Its time to get back to work and back to the grind.

I've got a lot planned for the coming months with many comparison tests starting today. I've linked up the TE so you guys can follow along however note that this account is trading multiple set ups with the EA so the results does not account for all the multiple tests running, but you can see whats going on anyway.

On the demo account I'm running 9 separate charts with 4 weekly comparison tests and 5 daily comparison tests. So far today's daily tests did not fair so well but that's testing lol. Tonight we'll start with the weekly basket tests.

Most of the tests are testing the differences between different open times for weekly and daily settings to try find a more optimal open time. These forward tests will go for around 3 months and thereafter after collecting enough data we'll know what works best to put to the test live.

Exciting times ahead guys!

I'm looking forward to your trading system, as I can't adapt my discretionary price action analysis to higher timeframes, such as the daily charts.

This weeks 03:00 and 04:00 baskets both hit TP of +10%.

The 23:00 and 05:00 baskets are still running.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hello friends, interesting strategy. I will follow this tread.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
So the 23:00 and 05:00 baskets did not hit TP and neither SL this week. I'll be closing both baskets manually later today shortly before London closes.

This weeks winners were the 03:00 and 04:00 baskets both hitting TP.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Thanks mrdfx for the great job. Please this trade time you give (03:00 and 04:00). Can you represent the timing in terms of GMT? Just to be sure of the GMT Equivalence.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I am a bit confuse on the different baskets on different time. Mind to enlighten me? I thought we will open the trades after the first 4 hour on Monday?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Based on overall rule, you should wait for the first H4 candle to be fully formed so more or less 3 hrs after the Monday daily close. as he said in post 524, he is trying to find the best open time for basket and it needs around 3 months of testing with different open times:

--- 帖子 #528 ---
i will try in my demo account the base setting of the ea.

only change the percentage of profit / loss. i with 10.000 balance

1% profit aweek or -2% loss. no more. let the ea to close itself on friday all trades. we will see.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
I feel a SL of -2% is too tight.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
@ procmail if the logic of this system is to follow the trend we should close any trade

wenever it reverses the trend so it can be used trailing stop losses... but i want first

to try base setting of the ea. were the sl is 2 times the tp. so accordingly if i set tp to 1 i will set sl to 2

then we will see whats happening. will open fresh demo for this.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
03:00 and 04:00 are my brokers times as I use broker time for the basket. My broker is GMT +2, so those open times would be 01:00 and 02:00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Yes correct however I am testing other open times which I have already previously mentioned.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Happy Monday everyone!

The first of the weekly tests has started, 3 more to go. Lets hope for a successful week!

Btw I'm working on a new update and will release more details soon.

I started new fresh demo account with ic-markets and set the ea with

allmost default setting. this night at 3.00 the ea will start opening the trades.

here is my setting will show the results on friday.

I suggest the author of the ea to add trailing step/stop in pips as in the

option of lotsize. thx very much.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Don't pay much attention to the TE as it is running 9 different tests 5 of which are daily tests and there is a lot of experimentation going on with them so the results you see is not indicative of the full results of the EA.

I've been making changes to the EA and settings that is being used for the weekly and daily sets so the TE is not entirely accurate of the EA. Things should pick up in the weeks to come.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Please see attached a new version 1.5!

V1.5. updates:

1. There is now the option to use current or previous candle/bar.

2. The trade day settings were updated so now you can select multiple individual trade days.

3. The time setting were updated and made easier to set and follow.

4. On the info panel the day, week, month, and year totals can be monitored in points or %.

This is now the most current and bug free version until someone picks up something.

As always please test on demo first if you will use this EA. Thanks!

The 04:00 and 05:00 weekly basket are still in play and not really going anywhere so I'll more than likely close them manually tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Just curious, how many pips are the +10%?

Edit: nvm, it's in the TE above I think.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Adding to this post just to be clear on the tests that I'm currently running, this is what I'm testing.

Weekly baskets (H4, D1, W1, MN1) opening at 23:00, 03:00, 04:00, 05:00.

Daily baskets ( M30, H1, H4, D1, W1) opening at 07:00, 08:00, 09:00, 10:00, 11:00.

These are the configurations I'm currently testing on the TE account you see attached so you can imagine with so many different tests that the TE will be all over the place, but as I remove the poor performing sets and start to fine tune the winning sets it should start to look a lot better. I'm expecting after 3 months to have more solid data on what setting and time works best and to put it to a live trading account.

You guys are welcome to share your tests and results, the more that participate the more data we can collect and find more winning set ups.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I already covered this in post #537.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
No you are incorrect. Times given are broker time not local time. I only referenced GMT as kefmawin asked about it.

Have you read the whole thread? This topic has been covered already in posts #302, #306 and #315.

There is no need to change how I put the open times all is clearly explained, unless you have not read the thread and just jumping in now.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
First of all Thanks mrdfx and others who have been contributing and testing.

I understand that the original weekly basket opens at 3:00 Tuesday broker time, in which Monday Daily D1 Candle has closed and it is then 3 hours into the first Tuesday H4 Candle.

My question is for the weekly basket opening at 23:00; Is his Monday 23:00 or Tuesday 23:00? as Monday 23:00 D1 candle will not have closed but maybe you are looking at Friday D1 and the Last Monday H4?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
I was testing the daily trades, and the GBP pairs from yesterday took out most of the profits for this week for me.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Can you share the results of the Daily baskets so far? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hmm I think I need to reevaluate and change the daily settings as they are not working out.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
In half day you had around 20% of all trades opened since you started. Really is crazy

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I had to close many orders manually as I put the wrong open day by mistake last night and some sets should not have opened.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
The weekly basket that opens at 23:00 is on a Monday, well technically its still the Monday candle.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Unfortunately that dirty your statistics. I think you should reset TE date for have a real view about system performance. Anyway you are making good job. Every time you are closer to have an stable auto system

PS: Nobody said it will be easy but is not impossible as others think. It's just have a plan and a lot of patience ( aka persistence )

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Thanks braintheboss, yes the TE is not a real true reflection of the system currently as there are many tests going on and I'm making changes to some here and there. Most likely I will start a new TE or just remove it until I have some tests completed and can show the final performance of the system.

For sure it is not easy and needs a lot of time and patience, but like they say if it was so easy everyone would be doing it.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I must be missing something.

I think it is a very promising project and I have great respect for the amount of work that goes into it but I can't see anything like a "stable auto system" that generates profits as yet.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I always follow how are working other systems for get a reference in my own tests. Evidently after some years I have a clear idea what things can make a system have success. And mrdfx have a long history of system evolution here. If you compare current test with his first you will see a clear improvement. Mainly about fix trading issues in previous tests.

Anyway in an auto system success is just turn system negative balance trend. As they are far of to be perfect, normally an auto system makes more mistakes and bigger that successful moments. Then question is just how digest losses without kill your profits. You have some ways as down trades number, close bad trades fast, etc. But as you know is difficult for a software understand every moment since logic is always so simple comparing with market complexity.

But I'm one believes you can make a reliable auto system. But it's a constant learning and you need answer the problems with a wider perspective. That means you have try don't apply manual trading "facts" and treat auto system like a kid. Kid needs simple explanation and very clear rules about you want he do

About OP I think is good he try find a way. It's better die trying it that to be all your life waiting luck call your door ( maybe wining lottery for example )

--- 帖子 #564 ---
No offence but:

What strikes me: as long as you need similes and metaphors to describe your system's parameters ("like a child" etc) you're probably as far away from an "auto system" as you can be.

I'm all for simplicity - but trading rules based simplicity and not poetic or pedagogic imagery.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I'm not talking ambiguous. Normally people building auto systems try solve mistakes adding more tools. This makes more complex mixes and normally worst all. Precisely he always tried use minimum tools in their systems. My approach is similar. Try do things simplest possible because it will easier for auto system deal with less rules. If you see is same I told in last post

If I use a metaphors is because I try give a easy explanation about the needs. The technical part is outside scope. And really is boring and useless part if you are not coder making systems. From my point of view he have good theory base when make systems

About question everybody do about every EA in this forum is easy to answer. Holy grail is not "download this EA and enjoy the money". Because if somebody find one just will keep for himself. Nobody will share a printer money machine. Even nobody will sell it. It's stupid if you think about this honestly. Regards

--- 帖子 #566 ---
It seems we have to agree to disagree.

As to EAs - nobody on FF has one that works long time, otherwise she/he wouldn't be on FF.

Sharing never was and never will be stupid; it's what created all civilizations we know of.

Short-term-thinking, greed, egotism and free-riding: those are things that ruined and will ruin every community in existence.

Wish you all the best

--- 帖子 #567 ---
You are little time here. This community is slightly different comparing with dictionary meaning

--- 帖子 #568 ---
follow the trend, is that same as price action?

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I have decided to remove the TE as it was not really truly reflective of the strategy or EA. As the account was running 9 separate tests which are evolving on a daily basis the results are not really accurate.

I will continue my testing and keep everyone updated as it goes and as time progresses and after I have more complete sample data of all the tests I'll be able to load a new TE that's more reflective of the strategy and EA with the successful sets.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
This night started the test for me

here my picture: still going in loss but we will see..

good luck to all.

Hello guys forgot to post last night, but this week the 03:00 basket has 11 pairs and currently in DD of -6%.

Lets see if it can come back during the week.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Thanks mrdfx for sharing you strategy i just discover it, will give it a try

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Well unfortunately this week is a loss, the 03:00 basket hit SL of -10%.

On a good note the other 3 weekly tests are still going.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
i changed the takeprofit stoploss setting to the default.

my test is still active but in loss. we will see on friday the close of trades.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I believe that the Japanese yen would have contributed to to the loss. I actually took note of the fact that there were two important Red News report that were to be released. As such I avoided any trade involving the Japanese yen until I saw much later the contrary direction it went. I took advantage of it and it paid off a little.

Manual trading this week

--- 帖子 #577 ---
my first week of test with the ea 1.4 was in loss.

I lost about 0.67% of my 10k demo account as in the picture.

We will see next week how it willl go.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
This trading style from the beginning is so simple, effective and gives high profit with only max 30 min  computer time per week. I don't understand why you hunting EA and get a bad result when you easily can get a nice profit with manual trading

--- 帖子 #579 ---
ause for me is more confortable to use the ea.

if the manual gives good result the same must be the automatic dont you think so?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
ok my friends, second week of test for me start with a loosing basket... we will se

at the end what will happen...

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hey guys, forgot to post my baskets last night, and this week the 03:00 basket hit SL, and the 23:00 basket hit TP.

The 04:00 and 05:00 are still running.

I'll post updates later this week.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Manual from 20/1 to 28/1

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I don't expect much action with these 2 remaining basket as one has 3 pairs and the other only 1 so depending how it goes I might close them manually tomorrow if nothing happens.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Interesting. Im sure you dont want to share your style? Are you adding to losers?

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Yes, I want to share. Have som modifications but to early to share.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
EA expired??

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hmmm... so 273 downloads of the EA and virtually no feedback or contributions... yup cool story bro...

New version uploading later!

--- 帖子 #588 ---
So one thing I always mess up is the TP and SL, because my balance changes on the demo account from testing other strategies and having to create a new demo every month. Ss there a chance we can tie the lots size, TP and SL together. So if I want to risk 1% on every basket the TP and SL values are based off of the 1%

Additionally, will big text that note that this is a free EA on the chart will prevent it from being missused?

--- 帖子 #589 ---
As most trades went in profit today i decide to close all.

In my demo account the loss passed from 0,67% to 0,19%.

here is the picture.

@ Mrdfx , I set the indicator as in picture of post 1 but

can you tell me if the ea's signal is = the indicator's signal?

is the indicator referring to candle 0 or candle 1 to look for the signal?

Thanks mrdfx for sharing your strategy

Wish you all the best

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I wanted to chime in on this system, after using it for my first week. Please forgive me for the lengthy post, but I'm hoping my experience so far will help someone.

I have been trading unsuccessfully for the last year and a half. I continually sought out the shiny new trading strategy, jumping form one strategy to another. When one did'nt work once or twice, I would jump to the next one. After trying out multiple strategies on FF, BabyPips, YouTube, and Udemy, it became very clear to me that what I was doing was not working. Continually searching for more garbage was not working, and I had spent too much money already.

It was at this point I had to realize that I was 'gambling' and not trading. I was also making several newbie mistakes. I did not understand price movement, and I did not understand how to implement a good strategy. So it was back to demo.

I have personally found only a few strategies that have worked for me successfully at this point. This first one is of course Follow the Candles, more on this in a few. The only pattern you will ever need, found on Baby Pips has also been effective. I have also had some success with trading currency strength/weakness using the Forex Power Indicator (you can google it).

The biggest mistake I have been making is jumping in and out of trades. Perfect example from this week: GBPAUD. The EA told us to buy on Monday night per the usual time 3 hrs after the close of the Monday candle. So I jumped into it along with a few other trades. Over the next day and a half, GA dropped and went sideways. I decided to cut my losses and bail on the trade. A day later it shot up significantly.

This is a critical point. Do not jump in and out of trades just because they go against you. It was merely a retracement. So I lost money on that. But the 3 other trades which I had running: EU, AU, and NU were slowly profitable. I held onto them all week, and ended up with 9% account growth after the GA loss.

Now the second critical point. Treat your trading like a business. I had no idea what that mean until I sat down and actually did the math. I sat down and looked for weekly goals based upon Follow the Candles. I want 5-20% every week. If I get that, then I slowly build my account. If I have a losing week, I will replenish those funds from my personal funds via my full-time job.

Now 9% growth for the week may seem like nothing. But if you do the math, you will be surprised. Think about it like this. You have $100 and you get 9% that week. That's a whole $9, whooptie friggin do! This is small potatoes. However, next week you will have $109. If your goals every week is around %10 growth, your account will eventually snowball. What if your account was $10,000? What is 10% of that?

You get the picture. Eventually you will make super good money if you stick to a plan like this. But as always, you will never win all the time. It takes patience and practice. I am still learning.

I hope this will help someone out there. Perhaps if anyone has any extra tips for me, I would love to hear them.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Maybe somebody here wanna back test my set.

Timeframe : daily, weekly and monthly.

(Why?? Because we need more signal to open position)

Open Hour : 16

Minute : 40

(Why?? I don't know. Just try it.

Don't use GBP pairs.

(Why?? I hate GBP pairs)

Close when u get profits, don't wait until Friday.

And Repeat next day..

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Have you been following the strategy with the strict rules as pointed by mrdfx?

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I have been. Enter 3 hours after Monday candle closes. Enter on pairs that agree on Monthly, Weekly, Daily, and 4 hour time frames.

It was my understanding that this was the strategy. Unless I missed something? Or if there is a better way?

--- 帖子 #602 ---
interesting post, except i think that only very green/newbie fantasist traders would consider 9% a week 'nothing'. Most people would be extremely content (to put it mildly)  with near enough 40% per month consistently

blam

--- 帖子 #603 ---
My return would have been higher except for the GBPAUD fail. Pretty good system so far. I'm not saying every week will be a winner, but all you have to do is enter when the trades lines up, and possibly endure some retracement.

So guys its a new month with some more testing to be done!

While the last month had some mixed results for the weekly set ups, I've been having some nice progress with the daily set ups. Still a long way to go of forward testing to check for consistency, but things are looking good.

I'm keeping track of the total basket profit in points so the numbers you see for the year are in points. For those that don't know, 10 points = 1 pip, so you can see how many pips the baskets are making... not bad at all...

How come your Mac is not compatible for MT4? I use Mac and MT4 works on macOS.

Download MT4 for Mac from your broker then install it to your Mac, and then the EA to your MT4.

Hi new update macOS using only 64bit program MT4 is 32bit

Apple's latest version of macOS, 10.15 Catalina, looks a lot like earlier versions of the operating system, but is vastly different under the hood. The biggest change is that Apple ripped out all the code that, in earlier versions, made it possible to run older32-bit apps in Apple's 64-bit operating system.

Hi Dino10, that option was removed as previously explained in #271.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Toppi indeed trading this strategy manually is very good and there is nothing wrong with trading it manually, that is exactly how I was trading it in the beginning.

The need or want for an EA came cos it was difficult sometimes to be at my computer every Monday at the same time to check the charts and open the orders, and when I was testing this strategy I actually missed a few weeks cos of this. I am also a fan of EA's as they do make life easier and trading more simplified. The rules of this strategy are pretty simple and coding an EA to automate the process was not so hard to do and it made trading this strategy a lot easier and convenient for me.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi tariqb15, why should I do that? Can you give a valid good reason what will be the benefit to add such an option to the EA?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
This has been a good week so far.

The 23:00, 03:00, and 05:00 weekly basket have all hit TP, only the 04:00 is still open.

The daily baskets have also hit their daily targets so overall a very good day today!

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hi mrdfx,

I did try some testing and I realized that the ea @3:00 am broker time always failed and the results are consistent within 3 weeks so if you could add a new feature option as reverse all could help more our testing for more accurate data information

thank you

--- 帖子 #634 ---
5.04% profit archived this week. DD 1.18%

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Reversing the suggestions of the EA is going against the main idea of the original strategy and I have no intentions of adding any such option. If you want to trade that way you can trade it manually and whatever the indicator says you do the opposite.

Btw long term statistics show that this strategy is profitable which I have covered before, but I'm guessing you have not read the whole thread, and this week hit it TP.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
excuse me, do you mind provide a list of your trades? or the pairs you trade, then others can check if their pairs are same as yours. thanks,

Hi mrdfx, i am actually testing your strategy, and it looks at first glance ""good"" !

--- 帖子 #638 ---
@mrdfx I am trying to understand your daily open times of 7:15, 8:15, 9:15 and 11:15 using M15 to D1 periods. What I have a hard time wrapping my head around is that at X:15, the M15 candle has just started so how can you know what direction it is going after just a few seconds of the new candle? It makes sense for the other periods as there has been some time to tell which direction that candle is going.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
This morning I closed all trades with little profit...

We will see next week...

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Please read the thread and you'll find the answer to your request...

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Setting the start time at :00 did not do well in my testing and I found starting at :15 was better, not sure why, but it is.

Feel free to experiment yourself with different open times and configurations and share your feedback here.

The more people that test and experiment and share their data the more we can improve on the results when we find the most optimal settings.

This strategy is quite versatile in that it does not only have to be traded at 03:00 each Monday, it can be traded at any day and time and perhaps there are other configurations that can be found that is also profitable, that is what I'm doing now.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Hi @mrdfx,

In my testing I have found daily baskets at 3:00, 7:15, 8:15, 11:15 overall losing baskets. Sometimes they have alot of signals, and maybe due to what I was alluding to which is the current M15 candle being so fickle since it just started. Also for say 8:15am, the H4, H1, M30 candles are all the same, so at best its really only a confluence of 3 D1, M30, and M15 which seems like a coin flip.  The daily basket at 3:00 is always losing with daily setup. Overall I have had more losing baskets than winning baskets. I seem to be good at finding bad times to open baskets. That being said @tariqb15 makes an interesting suggestion in having a reverse all option. As at least in my testing, it is hard to find a consistent time that yields winning baskets while there are plenty of times that yield losing baskets.. lol So maybe overtime if I played many baskets daily i would overall be making money.

I will continue testing next week daily baskets at X:25 so that there is a more clearer picture of how the M15 will close. Again thanks for your contributions, this is a fun thread.

--- 帖子 #643 ---

his week was closed soon.

I changed the lotsize according to balance set to true.

I changed the time close basket at 10.45.

the remaining was default.

use the ea 1.6.

but... but... why you Mr. Mrdfx cut off the day of the close basket?

Anyway i post the picture. today profit. I am thinking about to

trade every day in this way... dont know...

--- 帖子 #648 ---
How do I calculate the position size to match a certain % of my account per trade?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
don't be too restrict. 0.01 lot per $200. easy

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Which method were you using?

--- 帖子 #651 ---
my account $5000, lot size 0.03, trade at 3:00,

after 1 day, profit reached $63,

now, profit is $9,

It seems impossible to reach 5% profit with 0.03 lot size.

how much lot size is 5% profit target based on?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Actually, im using huge lot size to rach 5% weekly,or twice at week (Tuesday & Wednesday). I mean, 0.01 x 500€ ==> 2 lot on 100K€ account. I will see if we can have a good win rate yearly, 6:1 would be good.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Are you using the method in the first rules or did you tweek it a little bit?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Yep, original rules

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I have created an EA from this strategy and I think the original rules for TP/SL are pretty incorrect and should rather depend on the lot size than the account size as @dbsdsun well described the problem.

Here is the formula I personnally use :

Inserted Code if (AccountProfit()>5*getLots()*100||AccountProfit()<-8*getLots()*100) {
CloseOrders();
Sleep(5000);
}

For 0.01 lots per order, the EA will close the trades with 5$ of profit or -8$ euros of loss overall.

My lot size is calculated dynamically in regards to the account size.

My "Risk" parameter in the following code snippet is set to 1.9 so that it will trade 0.01 lot per order per 100$.

Inserted Code double getLots()
{
double Lot;
if(UseAutoLot == true)
{
Lot=NormalizeDouble(AccountBalance()*0.0015/28*Risk,2);
double Min_lot = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_MINLOT);
if (Lot <= Min_lot ) Lot = Min_lot;
if (Lot>MaxLot) Lot=MaxLot;
}
else
{
Lot=StaticLots;
}
return(Lot);
}

I have also implemented a time filter because i remarked the trades are going opposite direction by the end of the NY session.

I skip asian session also for the same reasons plus the low volatility in the markets.

I decided not to trade NZD pairs because I don't like their behaviour.

Here is the EA I coded...

The EA shall be placed on a SINGLE one minute chart and the trend indicator just goes into the indis folder, no need to load it on the chart.

All suggestions of improvement are welcome

due to chfjpy, eurjpy and gbpjpy, this week will be lost. if all trades were close on Tuesday, the result would be win.

and my lot size was 0.03 based on $5000. if it was 0.25, the result would be different.

It may be good to close 8 hours later, when these 3 pairs drop a bit.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hey guys I forgot to post this weeks results so here goes.

The 03:00 hit TP this week, but the 23:00, 04:00, and 05:00 hit SL. So far the 03:00 (original start time) is doing the best with +436 pips made this month.

Th daily sets are also doing pretty good. I've started to identify some daily sets that are not so profitable and next month I'll probably start filtering and remove some bad sets.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
my god, jpy weak again

--- 帖子 #659 ---
excuse me, what's your lot size and total capital? thx

--- 帖子 #660 ---
This week, I lost. capital $5000, lot size 0.03. if lot size is bigger, I think I can win.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
@Toppi,

You got upset that I disliked your post then you sent me a PM and put me on ignore. As I cant' reply to your PM as I'm on ignore I'll reply here in the thread.

Your PM to me:

Hi! Why you dislike my replay? You don't like when I have a good result? Maybe I misunderstanding you. From start, you write about "follow the candle" like manual trading. So what is the problem? I have so nice profit with the manual but not the same settings as you. Oaky, I understand, wrong thread, no talk anymore. Bye!

My reply to you:

Hi Toppi, I disliked your post cos you are always saying something negative about my EA. I'm happy that you are making profit using my strategy and yes it works very well trading manual I know as I was doing it myself, but I do find using an EA for this strategy very good as well as I already told you in post #636.

There's nothing wrong with using EA's and if you don't like them that is fine and that's your opinion, however you don't need to share your feelings about my EA every time in my thread. You are welcome to participate and share your results on the thread with everyone. Cheers. :-)

report for the week, work every day 3-15

thanks mrdfx

Can you provide lot size, total capital,open trade times? Thx

What's the meaning of "work every day 3-15"?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Based on this EA, maybe somebody here have EA that close all order by magic number??

Sometimes I open 2-3 times with this EA with different magic number..

Thanks..

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Unfortunately this week the 03:00, 04:00 and 05:00 baskets all hit SL. I wasn't watching them so I could not pin point which pairs were the losers.

On a good note the daily basket tests all hit TP, so far one of the daily tests is already +516 pips up this month.

How is everyone else tests going? Anyone testing different candle settings and timings?

--- 帖子 #667 ---
My daily basket yesterday (open 9:15, W, D, H4, H1) hit SL, 13 pairs.

My weekly bakset today (open 3:00 MN, W, D, H4) hit SL, too. All 8 pairs were loosers.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
You mentioned a number of times in your recent posts about the Daily Basket/Daily Set. Mind to enlighten me and perhaps the community, what are the settings for daily basket? Still watching the same H4,D1,W1,MN1 candles on daily basis? or, we need to watch lower time frames' candles?

And, close the trades by the end of the day? I suppose we need to close the trades manually daily, as the EA is written to close the trades on Friday or when the SL/TP is hit. Pls correct me if I am wrong or missing somethings.

Many thanks in advance for your precious time and wonderful sharing.

- Bill

I missed Tuesday. So I trade at 3:00 Wednesday (today). Just Tped.

$5000 capital, now $5253 total. lot size: 0.25

Thank you Mrdfx

--- 帖子 #670 ---
If you check post #613 you can see some charts of the daily sets and yes I'm still trading the original weekly set up.

I'm guessing you have not been reading the last few pages as then you would not have asked some of the things you did. Please read back to get yourself caught up with all the latest developments and updates to the EA, then I don't need to repeat myself.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
How do you do? This week still in loss for my account

with about -3,6% we will see if the market will reverse or

the Corona virus affects all the pairs.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
TP or SL are also related to your capital and lot size.

what's your capital and lot size?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
and do you mind to provide your trade history? otherwise, it's impossible to analysis your problem.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
initial capital its 10k firstly i made lotsize 0.01

then i activate 0.01 for every 1000 euro so now is 0.10.

will continue with this size.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
I think your lot size is too small. This strategy can predict near future better than far future.

If you check your trades frequently, you will find the total does grow up at the beginning, then it drops.

With your small lot size, it is very hard to reach 5% within a week. and I don't think you lost 10%. You may close the trades manually.

According to the starter, I suggest to try 0.01 for every 200 euro.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
to make it more clear, I post my trade history with this strategy

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #677 ---
today, I used the same setting. within 1 hour, 5% achieved.

Thank you very much, mrdfx!

Lot size really plays a critical role.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
And what setting are you using? The original rules or a small tweak?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
just trade today rather than Tuesday. lot size 0.25, capital $5000

--- 帖子 #680 ---
My daily basket yesterday and today (open 9:15, W, D, H4, H1) closed in profit.

Count:

2 baskets lost (1 daily, 1 weekly)

3 baskets won (2 daily, 1 weekly)

--- 帖子 #681 ---
May I know your capital and lot size? thx

--- 帖子 #682 ---
I trade 0,01 lot per 200 USD on weekly baskets. 10% SL, 5% TP with trailing stop of 1% as suggested by mrdfx.

I trade 0,01 lot per 400 USD on daily baskets. 5% SL, 2,5% TP with trailing stop of 0,5%.

I am not lucky with a fixed %-SL/TP for the basket as every basket may consist of a different size (ie. sometimes only 4 pairs, sometimes 13 pairs or what ever). At least on extreme baskets a fixed % SL/TP does not fit. I do not have a solution for it yet.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
I think 0.01 per $400 is a bad idea. logically, this strategy predict 4 hour much better than 1 day. Therefore, the quicker TPed, the safer.

To be quicker, you need a big lot size.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
I think you did not get me right. First look at my settings for my daily baskets: shortest candle on daily is h1 - not d1. And the reduced lot comes in conjunction with a reduced basket TP. The risk of this system is way to high with this sizes. I am trading on demo and would never go live with 10% SL for a single basket.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
I see.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
I see this system not as a fast scalping system where you have to be allways

in front of the carts but as a multiday long-term set and forget system

where you close all your trades in friday and start over again the next week.

So I will continue to test this way. Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Continue test and summary your experience

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Unfortunately today my account ended with -10% stop loss

and all trades was closed by the EA. I wait for the recover in the

next weeks... good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Its a very unpredictable and volatile time in the markets currently due to Covid-19 and most currencies are behaving very erratically making it difficult for any trend following strategy. It's best to be cautious and wait for some normalization to return to the markets.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
sure... perhaps the test can be stopped for 2 or 3 months waiting for

the situation to normalize... I am playing with demo so, no worry for loss but ,

in this situation the test wll be useless... so dont know how to do...

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Fortunately...I was able to make a small profit with the daily basket this week on a 10k account. I was using a separate Equity EA, found here on FF, for profit target but I think one can do that also with the original EA from the creator mrdfx.

I went for 50 EUR profit and 3% SL on the account.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If possible I used two start times per day...9:16 and 12:16h on the daily settings M15-D1.

Happy weekend all...

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Although this is a set and forget system, you really need to check after trades opened and got some idea about how the system works.

try 0.01 per $200, you will get a different result.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Dear Mrdfx,

Your system is very good! With 0.01 per $200, I TPed today.

Market is unpredictable for a day or a week, but it is predictable with 4 hr or 1 hr or 15 minutes.

Thank you very much!

Sorry if I come here again and put some bad feelings. But "follow the candle" is a very nice scalping method with manual trading. I have to get up to an 18% profit this week. Normally I set and forget early in the morning when I weak up and all my orders are in the close, maybe 2-3 hr later...

Please, thread starter I never say any negative about EA. It's up to everyone to use it but think about that we maybe miss something

--- 帖子 #695 ---
I agree with you. I think we didn't pay enough attention on lot size. Why don't you describe your method in detail? So we can check what's missing.

And there is nothing wrong with scalping as long as it can win.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
The owner will thank you if you can help him with your experience. How to set stop lose, how to set target, etc.

Now, I only say manual trade is better without detail information.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
No trend ? Return to a normal market ?

ha ha ha , good luck with that, or just trade the PRICE

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Just wanted to say thank you Mrdfx for making something like this. I've downloaded the indicators and will be trialling this out. looking forward to giving you some data.

As I haven't used indicators like these in quite some time, can I confirm that these settings are correct.

The only thins I changed were the timeframes and the pairs to watch. When you said that you could either look at the previous candle or current candle, is it changed at the starting hour variable?

Randomly downloaded an MT4 as most sites were forcing me to get MT5 and no I don't have a broker yet so if anyone can recommend one in NZ, I would be very glad to try it out.

I was having a think about all the information that I've read over in this thread over the past 3 days and wanted to toss in an idea to see if it would work. Currently the way the method works is to take trades when we see confluence in the 4 time frames. From the tests done, it seems like it works better when

1. More pairs are in the basket

2. Lot sizes are bigger as the target can be hit faster

In my mind there were 2 choices to make when we were in a week with very few pairs, either to not trade or increase lot sizes so that the 5% can be hit sooner and we run with money in the bank (which is my trading motto atm - here for a good time not a long time).

My manual trading right now depends highly on price action and in the past 6 weeks I think I've hit about 50% profit but then again I'm on a demo account and using 1 lot trades. I also make it a point to run when i'm about the 20 pip profit range - very important as I tend to get tempted by greed.

So here's my thoughts, is it possible to calculate the lot sizes based on the number of pairs in the basket that week and the number of pips that you want to hit that would make up your 5% / 10% profit? For example, if you only have 4 pairs, and you need $500 to hit 5%. By looking at price action, you make the assumption that it will take 25 pips so it becomes 2 lots / 4 pairs so each pair would be 0.5 lots. However, the lot size would be higher than in you had 10 pairs in the basket.

It's just a half formed idea that I had over dinner so I'm not too sure how exactly it would work. This might also increase the risk factor but like I said, half formed idea

--- 帖子 #699 ---
I greatly admire your efforts, but - at the moment - all pairs are trending either on H4 or D1.

So if your EA doesn't make money now it must contain one or more SERIOUS flaws.

You don't have to believe me, just use two EMAs and check all the currency pairs yourself.

Update on this weeks basket tests.

The 23:00 hit TP, and the 03:00 hit SL. The 04:00 and 05:00 are still open.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
It's a chaotic week in the markets with the market crash, but testing will go on. It will be interesting to see how this strategy holds up during these crazy conditions.

Last night some baskets were triggered and some not. the 03:00 had no valid pairs so no trade this week, the 03:00 has 4 pairs, 04:00 has 2 pairs, and 05:00 has 3 pairs so generally a slow week with few pairs to it will be interesting to see if they can reach the weekly target. I'll monitor the baskets and consider closing with a smaller TP if I don't see good movement.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Update on previous post, baskets 04:00 and 05:00 have hit TP of +5% and the 03:00 is still active in a slight DD.

--- 帖子 #711 ---

Hi MRDFX,

the trend indicator is not working. the candles are not showing any trend or colour. can you please help me ?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Hey guys I'm a bit delayed this side, but we off for the week!

The 23:00 had no valid pairs so there was no trade this week, the 03:00 hit TP last night, the 04:00 is still active and in some DD, and the 05:00 hit SL so a kind of a mixed bag this week depending on what time you opened the basket.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
The daily tests are still active and going well so far, but I need to do a lot more forward testing before I can compile any solid data. In 1-2 months I should have more good data and can share more details and set files of what I'm working on.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Hi MyCapitas, I'm not sure why it would not be working. I just checked on my chart and the indicator is working fine.

Make sure your terminal is connected and receiving ticks so the indicator can read the tick data and function.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
hey mrdfx

strange, my results of the default 3am weekly basket usually tally with what you /others report here, but unlike you, this week my basket hit SL. global prime broker

blam

--- 帖子 #721 ---
It could be down to broker data differences or money management settings.

What lot size are you using? I'm using 0.01/$333 or 0.03/$1000, this is a much lower risk money management so things would really have to go wrong to hit SL.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
i'm using higher, fixed 0.05 lots on a £3000 account. 4000 point tp and 4000 point sl. But I had accidentally left the % tp and sl settings in, however the negative basket was still not high enough to trigger either (it was about 212 pips). so its a bit strange

anyways have removed the 5% tp and 10% sl settings, will see what it does next week

--- 帖子 #723 ---
hey mrdfx

hope you're well. Is there going to be an update for the EA, i believe current version expires tomorrow

thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Hi blamshakk, I'm actually contemplating releasing the EA again as there has not been much feedback or participation from members here. The last version had 164 downloads yet I can count on 1 hand how many have posted some contribution.

I did not post my results last week, but I am still actively forward testing various settings and collecting data, yet it seems I'm the only one, and you that are using it so I'll give it some more thought about sharing my EA that people use, but don't participate.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
thanks, at this stage I'm testing the default settings and just trying to see how it does in the medium to long term, same as my approach to mist other systems, so apologies for the lack of regular feedback

--- 帖子 #726 ---
update: basket successfully closed this week with profit

blam

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Yes this week the default 03:00 hit TP, also the 23:00 hit TP.

The 04:00 and 05:00 hit SL and things are starting to emerge about which open time is best for the weekly approach.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Here is the EA with expiry set to end of the month. Based on my previous post #731, if there is not much participation from others then this will more than likely be the last version I share publicly.

The main point of giving the EA is for us to come together and test different ideas and settings, and to collaborate to find the best combination of time frames and open times. There are too many variations for 1 person to test so its good to have our own ideas of how we think the EA can work successfully, but if people only come and download and disappear that does not help anyone.

Post 1 updated!

--- 帖子 #729 ---
hey mrdfx

thanks for providing an updated version. can i chime in with my $0.02. EA testing is for me an extensive process which goes on for many months. I only have capacity on my pc to test one config (i'm using default) to gauge performance, as i have other test platforms ongoing. I can understand your frustration to not see people actively posting, but i suspect for many there is silent appreciation for anyone who shares their work, especially if it is a profitable.

If you are not going to update the EA, that is a strong and obvious disincentive for people to continue to test. What I can promise however is to report back every week how the weekly basket fared.

blam

--- 帖子 #730 ---
hi Mrdfx. I'll test your system and your ea. Thx for sharing.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
So this week has been another mixed bag and so far its hard to see an emerging winner although there's still lots of forward testing to do.

23:00 hit TP 5%.

03:00 hit SL -10%.

04:00 hit TP 5%.

05:00 hit TP 5%.

Now for the daily settings, some sets are starting to show themselves and I'm getting a pretty good idea of what set is working. A few more months of testing and I should have a winner for trading this strategy daily.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Yup the 03:00 basket reached TP last night with minimal DD.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Its been another mixed bag this week.

The 23:00 set hit TP nice and fast, but the default 03:00 set hit SL hard and fast last night.

I removed the 04:00 and 05:00 tests as overall the last cpl months they did not make profit and in place of them I have added 2 new 02:30 and 03:30 tests to compare. Funny thing is that over the last cpl of months forward testing the 23:00 basket has been doing pretty well and nearly a thousand pips in profit since testing 3 months ago. I've got it running with the new times for comparison and we will see if it remains consistent.

I also made some changes to the daily tests. With the forward data I already compiled I removed some sets and added some new ones. I've now got 12 new daily sets running which should help me compile some good forward data in the months to come. This should be fun!

I'm also working on the idea of adding a virtual basket similar to the CCFp EA. By doing this we can potentially avoid those baskets that run straight to SL like last nights basket. If we had been using a VB last night the EA would not have traded. So I'll keep you updated on that development.

--- 帖子 #744 ---

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Wow its quiet in here.

Well I'm pretty sure activity will pick up again once I post my profitable sets for the local FF spoon feeders.  Anyway moving on...

Its been a mixed start again for the weekly sets, the 23:00 basket hit SL and the default 03:00 hit TP. The new weekly sets are still running and close to reaching TP.

The new daily sets have been doing well, some have started to stand out making good profits and some have been terrible, but if I didn't test them I would not know.

I'm working on a new version which has the virtual basket option which should really help improve the stats.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
thanks for the update mrdfx, I haven't posted an update yet because my default 03:00am basket still hasn't closed, but it currently is in the positive so may well close out successfully

Please see attached the latest version 1.7!

V1.7. updates:

1. There is a new virtual basket option.

2. Cleaned up the inputs.

The new big addition to the EA is the virtual basket. It's pretty straight forward on how it works, but I'll explain for those that are not familiar with virtual baskets. I got the idea of adding a VB from the CCFp EA as it has worked very well for a basket trading style EA. Many thanks to xmess7 for helping out with the VB!

Basically what it does is that at the set open time the EA will look at the list of valid pairs and then it opens a virtual basket of those pairs and monitors them. There is a VB trigger value to be set by the user and when the total pips hits the trigger the EA will then open a real basket. I have set an option to only allow pairs in positive pips to be allowed to open and there is also a VB reset after the user selected time.

An example of how to use the VB, you can set a trigger value of 20 pips and a 1 hour expiry so when the EA opens the VB it will wait for the total pips of all the pairs to hit 20 pips and if it does it will open a real basket. If the virtual basket does not hit the trigger then after 1 hour the EA will reset itself and wait for the next session. You have the option to allow all pairs to open or only pairs in positive pips. I think I've explained pretty much how it works, you can play with the VB settings to and if you have questions please ask.

When you set the EA to use the virtual basket on the side of the dashboard a panel will open showing the pip count for all the valid pairs so you can monitor them. At the bottom of the dashboard it will show the trigger level in pips and the virtual basket pip count.

I think with the addition of the VB it can really help to filter out those baskets that hit a loss., and improve the overall results. By using the VB if the trigger is not hit the EA will not trade so there will be no loss. If course its not perfect and there will be times when the VB is triggered and the basket hit SL anyway, but this will really help to filter out those quick losing basket occasions we've had sometimes and minimize losses.

I have also decided to extend the expiry date and have set the expiry to 31/12/2020 so the EA will work until the end of the year.

This is now the most current and stable version. Please give your feedback!

Please test on demo first before thinking about trading this EA live. Thanks!

Post 1 also updated!

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hi mrdfx,

You can condition "Add new Trades suggestions on real basket" like EA CCFp?

Because I see EA only open pairs at the time the EA opened. When the basket has new pairs, the EA does not open new pairs.

If you using the VB option and it did not reach the set trigger value the VB will not open a real basket. The trigger value and max open time are set by the user.

Thanks for the details. So the virtual basket will have a limit and once the triggered then only the real basket will be triggered.

IMPORTANT UPDATE!

Please replace V1.7 for this new version 1.71!

There was a bug that if you were using the VB, it would reset itself before the max time is open set by the user. Its been fixed and is now working. This is why no baskets were opened if you were using the VB function.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Amazing EA today I'm lucky got 50pips ! Mr. DFX is this ea has a limited time or unlimited?

--- 帖子 #768 ---
expires at the end of this year, then it will be renewed

blam

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Thank you Mr. Blam

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Thank you so much. 150+ pips today in demo. Will keep monitoring daily versus weekly.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
While optimizing my EAs using "Follow the candles" entry conditions noticed that using ADX indicator gives better results because then you can measure the strength of the trend. And you can decide to include in the basket only those symbols where H4 timeframe ADX > 25. Just idea as I see ADX gives better results for my EAs for the same strategy as in your thread. ADX filters out weak trends.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
IMPORTANT UPDATE!

Please replace V1.71 for this new version 1.72!

Picked up a small bug where the vprofit was not updating on the side panel. It's been fixed so now you can see the pip count on the virtual trades before a real basket is triggered.

As always if you guys noticed anything please give your feedback.

mrdfx, is there any manual on Virtual Basket Setting ??? I dont know what they mean.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Hey guys happy Friday!

So this week has not been the best. After floating on loss the whole week the default basket hit SL today.

With the addition of the VB it has really changed things up saving many baskets from making a loss. I am also going to restart all my daily tests as now with the VB it changes the prospective results and I don't want to skew the existing data so better to start over again.

Is anyone experimenting with different settings? How is it going? Any feedback from the latest version or am I just talking to myself? lol..

--- 帖子 #775 ---
this week my default settings (but now with vb) sort of hovered a bit and closed out for a smaller SL of 65 pips

IMPORTANT UPDATE!

Please replace V1.72 for this new version 1.73!

Ok guys I picked up a small bug where sometimes virtual trades were not opened when the RB was triggered, this has been fixed. Thought I'd get this out quick before the week starts.

This week's default settings of 03:00 hit TP and the other sets are also doing well.

The new daily sets are doing good as well and the addition of the VB has really helped to filter out some of the bad days. I really think the VB an help us stay out of the market when things are not in our favor.

Since the last update on Sunday there have been 22 downloads, any feedback guys? How it going?

--- 帖子 #778 ---
my default basket also hit tp, looks like all the bugfixes have paid off, thanks mrdfx. Good to hear the news on the daily baskets as well

Hello guys, i downloaded EA, but I am little bet lost here because I am not sure what are the inputs of the ea.

Can anyone help me with the best time frame and the EA setting much appreciated as I dont know what to change in the input

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Hi and great work , I have a couple of questions

On VB the reset is each day or each hr ie

If it has loss basket after 1hr it resets and continues through the day showing current basket

And early I know but is 1hr optimal as seems quite a short time frame

Also and finally is it possible le to switch off opening a live basket as I would like to use the ea as a trend indicator not to trade and monitor it using my other trading system

Ie looking for trend confirmation and this looks really promising

Thank you

--- 帖子 #783 ---
IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!

Please replace V1.73 for this new version 1.8!

There was a very crucial bug with the VB, but this has now been fixed. The EA is now working 100%. Please update it asap if you use the VB guys.

As always if you guys noticed anything please give your feedback.

Hi SirLight, all your answers have already been explained in the thread, that's why no one has replied to you. I suggest you read the thread, its only 40 pages.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Hi censura, if you don't manually reset the VB, it will reset on the next new day roll over (broker time).

I'm not sure how it would work only on H1, but you are free to experiment and share you results.

If you don't want the EA to live trade you can set the VB to true and set a high VB trigger like 5000 pips then the VB will run, but no live basket will open unless somehow it reaches 5000 pips and you can monitor the pairs manually.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Hi mrdfx, thanks for the EA.

I set it for daily basket with trailing profit in percentage last week, it is 2% with 0.5% trailing. However, the basket is only closed without trailing effect.

Also, after I set the basket trailing last week, I encountered that when a basket was opened and not closed, another new basket is not able to open. Is this due to the setting of basket trailing? As a week ago, when there were no basket trailing setting, new daily basket could be open every day no matter there were old basket or not.

Please clarify.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Hi ecmoney, as far as I know the trailing stop does work, make sure it is enabled in the settings.

The EA will not open a new basket of orders if it is currently active with a open basket of pairs. If you want to open a new basket while one is currently open then open a separate chart to run a new basket. You can also edit the close hour for the EA so it can close daily and open again the next day.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
This weeks weekly basket will be interesting as today it's the start of a new week and a new month. Lets see how this week goes.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
My default basket went initially into profit before being stopped out (i think by trailing stop) for overall loss of -160 pips

blam

--- 帖子 #790 ---
My default 03:00 weekly basket is still active floating around -2.7% with only 3 valid pairs this week. It was initially in a good profit last night close to TP, but reversed during the day.

Personally I don't use the TS as in my testing it did not work for me, but its there for those to use if they want.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
The "Follow the candles" conditions for entry works quite well (71% profit in 6 months). You can see real account results based on this strategy so far in my TE.

But I am not using this thread EA. I am making a basket in a different way. Here is how:

Have backtested separate each symbol and found the best candidates to include in the basket (in my case 13 symbols) which in 10 years history gave the best results with this strategy (month, week, day candle following).

And each symbol included in the basket having a specific time when to open and close (if not SL/TP hit). And each symbol has different risk/reward ratios (SL/TP).

So, if anybody interested here for other opinions based on my 10 years backtests and 6 month real results then you might adjust basket forming/operating logic in your EA. Just advise - because I appreciate your thread and I am happy you are working on this EA/ideas you have here.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I have been testing your EA for the last three days with good results. I used it daily with TP 3% and SL 5%. Today I opened a basket 2 hours before NFP news, and it reached 2´5% gain just half an hour after the news. Maybe it would have reached 3% in just some minutes if the USDCHF would have given a buy signal today, LOL. I attach today´s results.

I have opened a new demo account to test it, thank you very much for your generosity sharing this great EA!

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Very good results. Could you share the settings for your baskets? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Unfortunately price continued on its reversal and the basket hit SL.

Over 100 downloads so far and I can count on one hand how many are actively participating sharing their results in the thread.

This weeks default settings hit SL.

So far its been a mixed bag the last few weeks, and there's no clear sign of which weekly set is better.

Perhaps I need to look at adding another trend filter that could help filter out those pairs that are valid according to the strategy rules, but turn to a loss.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
same result here

I added this EA on MT4 with default settings but I'm not able to see all the pairs listed in the "Market Pairs" section.

I only see a few of them on the EA dashboard.

Can someone help please?

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Make sure you have all the pairs visible in your market watch for the EA to read the pairs you want it to monitor.

You can also adjust the panel size settings so it fits correctly with your computers screen resolution.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Hello mrdfx!

I thank you for sharing the EA. I tested your EA for a week but with 4% settings: 2% and 0.02 Lots for 1000USD. I only came to order when the basket reached 15 pairs or more, the time frame after the US session opened 1 hour and ended before the European session ended on that day.

Last week I was up over 10% in 1 week.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
I use your EA as an indicator. When the colors match, I enter according to the currency strength indicator. The results are still good.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
my default basket hit stoploss today

blam

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Yup the default basket hit SL, and funny enough all my other weekly test hit TP. The 03:00 was the only one that hit SL.

There is definitely a big difference on outcomes depending on what time you open the basket, and this still needs extensive forward testing. Unfortunately I'm only one guy and doing many many multiple tests and only have so much computer resources lol..

--- 帖子 #808 ---
I entered 2 trades yesterday based on this EA. Both of them resulted in profit.

I kept all the parameters same except 3 below -

STOP LOSS/TAKE PROFIT - 300/600

Virtural Basket Trigger - 7 Pips

Allow +ve trades only - True

--- 帖子 #809 ---
hey mrdfx

Seeing as you are already testing the default basket and gathering data, we are sort of doubling up. I am also testing a lot of other systems, so can only really dedicate one terminal to this EA. If you specify a custom time that you are not testing already, am happy to go with that setting and report back

blam

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Good idea, for the weekly sets I'm currently testing 23:00, 02:30, 03:00, and 03:30.

I've already tested 04:00 and 05:00 which did not wield good long term results. I've been thinking about doing a 01:00, 01:30, 02:00 sets when I get a chance so if you can add any of those.

There are so many possibilities with this strategy, it will just takes some time to test the different variations to find the sweet spot.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
ok thanks in that case from next week I'll try a 01:00 basket

blam

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Thanks blam, are you only able to run one time frame per terminal?

--- 帖子 #813 ---
As in, I could run different time slots on different charts on the same terminal and separate them by magic number? And analyze it that way?

blam

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Yes. For example I have a terminal on my testing machine which is dedicated to only trading the FTC EA, and I'm running 16 charts concurrently, with each chart being a different time frame, so if you could you could run 3-4 separate charts each running the EA on their own time frame.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
I stopped trading daily the H4-1D-1W-1M timeframes, because bad results. But, I am testing the M15-M30-H1-H4 and M15-M30-H1 and today it gave very good results. I attach the details.

(I forgot to minus the account commissions).

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Hi luatrader, can I know how you adjust the inputs of the EA to trade the lower time frame signal?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Sure, these are my settings

--- 帖子 #818 ---
ok I could do that, can do 01:00, 01:30, 02:00

I'm not used to doing something like this, can you just separate the results by magic number in say Trade Report indo or something? any advice would be appreciated

It means, you should keep on diggin in D1 and W1, instead of moving away from them... I am 110% convinced, you can find in there something interesting... Maybe not with this EA in particular, because the idea is great. Maybe the execution is that... sucks?!

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
First of all, I would like to thank mrdfx for the wonderful EA.

Luatrader, I had tried the inputs you provided with my demo account. Basket of trades was opened and closed within 4 hours with profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

. I like this short term trade. Will do more forward testing on it.

You had provide 2 sets of input, what is the difference?

Thank you

Corinna

--- 帖子 #825 ---
I am happy you had profit! The 2 sets of input I provided are for: 1) M15, M30, H1 timeframes and 2) M15, M30, H1, H4 timeframes.

The EA lets you select 5 different timeframes at a time, and I selected the shortest ones.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
You must load the EA in your chart to see the Broker Time

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Yes open 3 separate charts, and load the EA on each chart for the 3 different time frames and change the magic number for one. You can also change the trade comment so you can keep track of the different baskets.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
No live trading this week, no weekly baskets were triggered. On to next Monday!

--- 帖子 #829 ---
From this week, as agreed, I am also testing (as well as default) , 1am, 1.30am and 2am. The only basket triggered was 2am, and it hit full stop loss.

mrdfx, please could you add that to your list of stats?

thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #830 ---
this week 1am, 1.30am and 2am baskets all fired, all went to stop loss

Yup not a good week for the weekly set ups. Some of them went as high as 2-3% but the reversed.

hello mrdfx,

I came from ccfp forum and stumbled upon this thread. congratulate you on your thread. btw I downloaded the EA and notice something. its not performance issue. i think its more of display issue. when i loaded all pairs vs selected pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, USDCAD). one of the pair got cut off from the display (usdcad). i will post pic. i didnt change anything settings.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Hi minigan, thanks for coming by. That's just a graphical thing caused by the screens resolution. You can adjust the panel size in the settings to make it fit your screen correctly.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
I used standart setup with EA and it took 12 trades and close yesterday with 5% profit

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Awesome Johannes7, not sure how you hit TP this week, but that's great.

Perhaps it was your MM so it allowed you to pull through the DD while ours hit SL?

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Hi Mrdfx,

Can i just ask, have you played about with starting on different days off the week, i fine that mon/tue are more turn over days then wed/thur/fri seem to be trending days, but like in forex that is not always, just my pennies worth.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I just used standard setup, maybe just lucky.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Hi stu48, I am experimenting with opening before the Monday daily close, but not on any other days currently. Unfortunately my computer resources are already maxed out so there are limits on how many variations I can test at one time, that's why I have repeatedly encouraged others to test different settings and open times to help. i do believe and think there are other days and settings that could be very profitable, we just need to find them, and that comes from team work. If you can perhaps test your ideas and let us know how it goes.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Another bad week for the weekly baskets all except one hitting SL.

I'm starting to have a decent amount of weekly data compiled after many weeks of testing. Being a weekly approach it takes time to gather enough forward testing data to make any kind of proper analysis. I'll definitely be making some changes to the weekly approach and I'll update the EA accordingly in time.

The daily approach is also coming along with the top daily basket +350 pips in the last 3 weeks. I'm still testing for consistency and like I have said before I think having some kind of additional trend filter might help improve things, I just need to find it.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
my update for the week:

1am and 3am default baskets went to stop loss, 2am basket went to tp

Great EA, thanks mrdmrdfx,

I've been testing for last couple of days a setup M15/M30/H1 which I trigger every 1 1/2 hrs (I open 4 charts at 3/4.30/6/7.30.......) and external EA manages the trades. At the moment 70 trades open and with -$132 floating. First I started with all pairs but have taken out all CHF pairs which I closed for a _$80loss as you can see.Is it possible to have a time window where EA is providing constant trades from 3am-8pm (always firing) ...EA finishes trades at times within minutes so finished trades will be taken again if signal exist. Thanks as always!

Hey guys I'm asking if someone would be able to make an ADR indicator that will display the ADR for the 8 currencies like an index.

Basically instead of showing the ADR for individual currency pairs it will show the ADR for all pairs together together.

For example the 20 day ADR of EURO.

EURAUD - 83

EURCAD - 69

EURCHF - 41

EURGBP - 42

EURGBP - 63

EURNZD - 113

EURUSD - 44

Total 455 / 7 = 65

So we look at the individual ADR's of the 7 pairs, then add them up and then divide by 7 to get the average ADR for EURO. So the ADR for EURO would be 65.

If someone can make an indicator that will do this for all 8 currencies and then list them separately with their ADR.

Thanks in advance whoever can do this. :-)

Did you got any indi in this regard ???

Today marks the end of another month of forward testing and the completion of some weekly and daily sets testing. I think I have found a successful weekly set and a successful daily set which I will put through some more forward testing to try out some different MM approaches.

Attached is the pip count log I was keeping on the tests and as you can see the daily set was extremely profitable over the last 8 months of testing. Its very promising.

I'll also be uploading a new version of the EA this weekend that has quite a few changes.

Have a great weekend FF.

I have been following silently. Thanks for continuing to push this. Look forward to forward testing the new version

Looks great Mrdfx, thanks!

--- 帖子 #856 ---
IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!

Please replace V1.81 for this new version 1.9!

Ok there have been a few changes with this new version so please take note!!!

1. Added a virtual memory function for the VB so now if you accidentally close a chart or restart the terminal with an active VB the EA will remember the vProfit and pip count.

2. Finally fixed the vProfit bug so now it refreshes correctly and displays the correct pip count that matches with the total VB profit.

3. Based on months of forward testing I have also updated some of the default parameters. If you use your own presets then it is less important. See below.

Besides the addition of the virtual memory function for the VB the most notable changes is the default time of open. Previously the default time had been 03:00, and in my manual trading prior to having an EA this was the time which I used more or less, but with using the EA and being able to forward test multiple open times, the 03:00 basket had not actually been very profitable over the long term and another open time had 'stood out from the pack', and this is 23:00 on a Monday before the daily close. So now instead of waiting for 3 hours after the daily close of the Monday candle we are waiting till the last hour of the first daily candle and then trading in that direction. Over the last 7 months of testing it has been the most profitable and consistent weekly basket as can be seen from my previous post #861.

Future ideas:

I am contemplating adding a MA filter so we would only add pairs that passed the MA filter, for example only buys above the 100 EMA and only sells below the 100 EMA. I'm still deciding how best to apply this filter as we dealing with a basket of multiple pairs and I will work on it in the coming weeks. I do think that having an MA filter can help to filter our those pairs that are moving against the main underlying trend. I'll keep you guys updated on this new development.

As always if you guys noticed anything weird or picked up any bugs please give your feedback.

Post #1 updated!

Thanks Mrdfx for the update.

Which opening times and setting are you using for Daily setup?

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Interesting strategy, i added EA on my IC Markets Demo,

is tat enough to add EA to a one pair chart, or do i need to add all pairs on separate charts, Thank You

--- 帖子 #859 ---
The daily forward testing is still ongoing, but feel free to test and experiment daily tests yourself and see what results you have.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
You can run the EA on default settings if you like, only adjust the MM to your preference.

You only need to load the EA on one chart, but make sure the pairs on the list in the EA settings are also visible in your market watch so the EA can see them.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
No trading this week, the new weekly basket sets did not trigger their VB.

The daily sets however hit their daily targets both yesterday and today, which is a good sign of things to come I think.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Hello mrdfx, firstly many thanks for the update and the good news that the EA is working as it is supposed to do!

I admire your patience and your constant efforts to improve the EA on and on. Although I could not find any consistent starttime for the daily trading I believe it has still much potential. An additional MA filter, perhaps in combinaion with the daily pivot, would surely help.

I'm testing the following daily settings: M15,M30,H1,H4, VB 10 pips (only postive), current candles, different start times. Any hints by you?

Thanks, jdva

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Hello jdva, thanks for testing, I look forward to your results.

You are on the right track for the daily sets. If you testing daily then maybe try include the D1 time frame as well?

For the daily sets its very important to test various open times as the market changes throughout the day during the different trade sessions so its good to experiment and see which one works well, this is what I'm doing.

It's also important to try different kinds of MM as I have found that also plays an important role in the results we can have.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
this week, 1.30 and 2am baskets both fired, both hit stoploss

blam

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Yep...tough FED week on the daily settings too. I could not make any progress. more losses than wins.

I'm not quite sure how to use the VB, sometimes it seems that a negative trigger value would allow to catch a pullback in a trend!? Maybe mrdfx can explain if one is able to enter a negative value at all and whether the EA is working so.

Happy trading, jdva

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Thanks blam, and the 1:00 did it not trigger this week?

My weekly sets did not trigger so no trading again this week, I guess its a sign to stay out the market.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Hi jdva this post explains about the VB:

https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post12912330

As the VB is currently designed there is no option for a negative trigger, it only looks for positive trades to trigger an upper movement.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
hey mrdfx

sorry yes the 1am did trigger this week with 8 trades, but basket closed out at breakeven, my bad

blam

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Thanks for info, mrdfx!

Do you possibly plan to implement such a negative VB trigger feature? I think it would help a lot to get better entries on trends.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Not at this time as I don't see how having a negative trigger VB will benefit the strategy, this means you are trading against the trend.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
No trading again this week for the weekly baskets, the VB did not trigger.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
update for this week

Hi,

Can you please explain how does How "Percentage to Trail" setting works. Have had some strange outcomes in demo.

Is it a initial SL level in % when "Percentage to Start Trailing" is hit, or is it a distance from "Percent to Start Trailing"?

Also, what is the trailing step e.g. how much the profit needs to increase for trail stop to be moved up?

Basically I want to start trail at 1.5% and set trailing SL -0.5% from running profit.

Many thanks in advance!

Hi mrdfx,

I'm a bit late to the party but I have just started testing your EA on daily setups.

I'll report back with some findings in  couple of weeks...

Cheers

Carlos

hello mrdfx, thank for the indicator and the EA that you provide, may i ask some question to clear my mind after read your thread and post

1. in the indicator setting starting hour, its the broker time or GMT time? because my broker using GMT+3 as the time, because the EA default setting is broker time 23:00 to open trade, so i got confuse whether on the indicator setting starting hour is 00:00 or 03:00, thank you

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Hey guys I forgot to update this week.

The 23:00 weekly basket triggered and hit TP as well as my other weekly tests.

I am also finished with my daily testing and after compiling all the data later this week, I will post the settings here in the thread.

As the weekly testing is a lot slower I still need another 1-2 months to verify the results as being consistent and then I'll share them as well.

It's a pity there were not more people participating as then I'm sure we could have found many more good settings to use. Unfortunately my PC resources are limited so I could only test a limited number of various settings, and I'm sure there are still many more that can be found with more time and teamwork.

Anyway I know how it works here on FF, the majority are looking for the quick fast profits and they not willing to invest the time and effort needed to find a good profitable system, they only want to be spoon fed. True story..

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Hey blam that is strange as I have not encountered that happening on my end. I will be posting another update soon, but that has to do with the VB.

If it happens again check the logs if there was anything printed that might help explain what happened.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
The way the TS works is like this.

You set the % that you want the EA to start trailing lets say at 5%, then you set the % to trail, lets say 1%. So now when the basket reaches 5% the TS will be activated and it will move up the SL by 1%. For every 1% thereafter 5% as long as price keeps moving the EA will trail the stop at 1% from BE.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Hello mas2cool, the time is based on your broker time not GMT.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
I have to ask i dont have experience with EA is this EA take the trades by itself or I have to put it

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Thanks, its somewhat clearer. Just to be sure lets take example of the 3 settings controlling trailing:

Take Profit % of Account=1.0

Percentage to Start Trailing=1.5

Percentage to Trail=0.5

1) What happens if profit of 1.3% is reached but then it falls back below 1%? Is the initial BE set at 1.0% (Take Porfit % of Acc.) level? Is 1% of profit collected?

2) When 1.6% of profit is reached, where is the trailing stop set? At 1.6-0.5=1.1%?

3) What is the trailing step e.g. which setting controls the step after trailing has started?

Many thanks!

No trading this week for the weekly baskets, the VB did not trigger.

The daily sets have hit their targets. Almost done with compiling all the data and will share the preset.

Hey mrdfx

Just found your thread here, thanks for all the hard work. I've got a few day set demos running and ran into a bug overnight - the virtual basket stayed open well past the 2 hr limit from the inputs and triggered a real basket opening even after trading was supposed to be done for the day and the virtual basket was set to have closed hours before. The set opens 45 min after Tokyo open and closes 30 min before Frankfurt open. Not a huge issue, just wanted to bring it to your attention!

Thanks again for all you your efforts, nothing like a simple successful strategy to win the day!

--- 帖子 #890 ---
sorry for the late update. This week only the 3am basket fired, for full tp

Hi gabriel888, can you post a screenshot of your setting particularly the timing and VB settings? Also please make sure you are using the latest version.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Thanks for having a look:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #893 ---
From first look it does not seem like there is anything incorrect with the settings, did anything print in the logs? Personally I have not had this error so I am relying on you to help if/when it happens again.

If the VB does not reach the trigger within the set time it will print a message saying that the VB did not trigger and the VB was closed. Once that happens the EA stops the VB and and the pip count you see in vProfit column and VirtualBasket Profit will stop counting.

The next time if it does happen please show the prints and confirm if the vProfit pip count is still active after the VB is supposed to have closed.

It is unfortunate that with over 350 downloads there is not much feedback on results, or having any bugs. Not getting reports of having bugs is of course a good thing, but no feedback on results is disappointing, but I guess is to be expected from a public forum where the majority are only taking and not giving.

What people don't realize that there is power in numbers and the more that participate and forward test the faster we will find the best set to be profitable with this strategy together.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
I'll keep an eye out for it - i didn't find anything in the logs. I turned it off for now, but will load it back on my vps

I'm curious to see how the basket will perform after tokyo open and london close - i'm hopeful there will be slow moving winning baskets at that time.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!

Please replace V1.9 for this new version 1.91!

Fixed a small bug with the VB so now the valid pairs and their pip count in the vProfit should match with the VirtualBasket Profit.

As always if you guys noticed anything weird or picked up any bugs please give your feedback.

Post #1 updated!

So the previous version had 394 downloads with virtually no feedback, so in light of this it appears to me that people are not using the EA so I guess then I will stop further development and posting here and just keep it to myself for my personal trading. Cheers.

Hi mrdfx,

1. Thank you for your excellent idea, for your outstanding work developing the EA and for generous sharing & support.

Very impressive stuff.

2. I just found this thread a few days ago while searching for indicators and EAs to use in a strategy I'm trying.

I have been reading all pages from the beginning and catching up with results from you, Blam and a few others.

3. I think there is a way to use FollowTheCandles EA to make a much larger return with same or lower risk.

In post #861 you said " the daily set was extremely profitable".

This idea could multiply that Daily return by X2, X3, X4, X5 or more.

The suggestion is:

For Daily settings, once a basket is opened, the EA rechecks trend direction every X minutes (e,g, M5, M15, M30, etc.)

and opens an additional, new basket with the same set up. If one or two of the pairs from the original basket has changed and don't

get opened in the new basket the EA will only be adding pairs that are still trending.

With the current version of the EA, for example, to trade 3 hours NY open, we can set up 12 separate EAs with same setup, but with

start times every 15 minutes 14:00, 14:15, 14:30, 14:45, 15:00. 15:15 ...

When the EA finds a trend and opens a basket it should open additional baskets in the same direction for a limited time.

Riding the sort-term, profitable trend, and limiting risk exposure from longer term fluctuations.

A question, which there may not yet be an answer to:

To avoid having to open 12 separate EAs;

After the EA has opened a basket, can the Start Time be manually changed to a later Start Time so the same EA will open, and manage, new baskets at the new, later time?

My plan is to try this approach this week and report back.

From all of us following this thread Thank You again for your excellent EA and generous sharing.

Stay safe in this crazy time.

All the best,

Northwind

Results for first day's test.

Still learning how the various setup parameters work so not strictly by the set-and-forget rules.

Had 9 EAs running, to trade NY open. Each EA with different Start Times: 13:00, 13:15, 13:30, 13:45, 15:00, 15:15, 15:30, 15:45, 16:00

The 1st 3 had 0.5 Lot Size. way too large, but exciting to watch.

The rest had 0.05 Lot Size which were more appropriate for so many trades open at the same time.

The TP was set at 10% for the 1st 3 which as too large. They easily hit 3% before sliding back down.

So TPs were reset to 2.5, 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2 etc. Which means all baskets hit TP.

Will run again tomorrow.

mrdfx,

As part of experimenting with the EA, I tried changing parameters of an EA that had already opened trades.

Changed the start time ahead by 5 minutes and the EA opened new trades and managed them with the same magic number, adding to the basket totals.

Changed the lot sizes and new trades opened with new lot sizes.

Changed the TP % and EAs adjusted for the new values.

All this on the fly after trades were opened.

This is a very robust, flexible EA.

It looks like it can be adapted for trading long-term, intermediate-term and scalping.

Thank you mrdfx. Very impressive EA.

All the best,

NW

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Maybe it was discussed already, sorry.

I test daily set M15,30,H,4H with the 9:15 open candle and 22:45 close candle,

which are the first candle of LO and the last one of NY (in my GMT+2)

My results for 09/22/2020.

There were a lot of open trades at one time (approximately 170) and the EA managed them correctly. Great job.

Two issues today:

1. Most of large loss is because I forgot to correct (lower) the lot size for the first 2 early baskets.

2. $473 of the lost is from another experiment with ultra short-term scalping.

Not a total loss because I learned more about the excellent EA.

Results for today 09/23/2020.

Set up two groups of baskets.

First group of 4 baskets 8:00 am to 9:00 am broker time around London open.

Second group of 5 baskets 15:00 to 16:00 broker time around New York open.

Starting baskets around 15:30 seems to give the best results.

The London, first group did not do well.

The New York, second group did better but not well enough to off-set the loss from group 1.

I do like the flexibility of the EA.

Hi mrdfx,

I think this is a terrific piece of work you have created.

Thank you.

Found what may be a bug in the EA.

To make sure I didn't miss something, I will go back and triple check the settings.

There are 28 pairs in the EA.

There are 4 separate EAs set to open orders every 15 minutes, each with unique magic number.

For some reason this particular instance decided to open double the number of orders.

The other 3 instances worked correctly.

Yes, EA screen will briefly turn gray while it recalculates and then turn colors again.

Usually less than 30 seconds.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
OK, i think I figured out what happened.

During the 1 minute to open trades, the candle for 19 pairs switched up/down/up or down/up/down in the shortest timeframe.

And EA recognized the changes as new signals to open trades.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Results for today 9/24/2020.

Was in profit $189 after 7 of 9 baskets closed.

The last 2 baskets took a dive to close at SL.

Having the double basket go to SL didn't help.

Whole day is negative.

I looks like the best time to open a basket is 30 minutes after New York open and London open.

My results for today, 9/25/2020.

The week ended up positive but only because of Monday's baskets with large lots.

Today,just like yesterday, some baskets closed with profit.

The remaining baskets drifted lower for awhile then dropped to SL.

Results for today, 9/28/2020.

Using Virtual Baskets 3 of the 5 London Open time slots opened baskets and they all closed with profit.

In addition I tried baskets using only correlated pairs.

These correlated pairs had 4 NY Open time slots. 2 of the 4 baskets opened and closed in profit.

These correlated  pairs had much smaller draw down.

The correlated pairs were:

EURUSD,USDJPY,EURJPY,GBPUSD,GBPJPY,AUDUSD,AUDJPY,USDCHF,GBPCHF,EURCHF,AUDCAD,USDCAD,EURCAD

You can search for "forex pair correlation" to see different correlation combinations.

47 pages is a lot to read and after doing that I have some comments. Regarding the weekly approach the most significant bar is the H4, since it can change faster than the others. In the matter fact you cannot know if that bar is against the actual H4 trend! It is just a picture of the moment. The VB concept filters that, but you can do it another way. In stead of the H4 bar then make a meassure of the trend on H4 using EMA40 and EMA20. That gives a more correct picture of the H4 trend. It is very easy for the programmer to do this.

Another comment is, that all days are different. I noticed that 3:00 was a perfect entry point for a long time. Then it was 23. I therefore think, that it is random. You might find an entry point that statistically and historically is the best, but going forward it will be another entrypoint - and you don't know before you have statistical data of that new period.

I really think you should try changing the H4 bar into a moving average trend.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Got it now! When is the price running fast? Right after the opening of a market. Where does it go? Hopefully in the direction of the trend. So the EA should do this:

Take the trend for H4 (as a MA trend indicator), D, W and M (those can just be the direction of the bar as it is allready).

Trading time should be after the first bar of market open. So there will be 3 trades possible Nortwind if this strategy shall be tried. Asian, Europe and USA.

I would trade at the close of the H4 bar, which is at 10 am GMT for the London open. At that time the day mostly has started to develope into the daily trend. 2 pm GMT at the USA open. That is exactly on the opening, but the US market often takes the right direction right at the beginning. You could of cause wait an hour to see how it goes.

Would I use VB. No, the idea is very fine but it seems that too many weeks goes without trading.

As the EA is not doing the Moving Average test on the H4 bar, this must be done manually if somebody want to test this approach.

I don't have the power to test this now, because I am doing another EA at the moment. But sometime in the future I will make an EA.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Well - couldn't help it. I just made an EA this morning. The strategy is a cross of the "Follow the candles strategy" - i will call it "Traffic Light" in my strategy - and the well known London Open strategy. Here is what it does.

At London Open and on US Open it will check the Traffic Light. All pairs that fullfill 4 green or red bars are a subject for the basket. When ever they break out of the box which is drawn by the high and low of the last 4 hours, the EA will buy (Long or Short) and the pair will be an active part of the basket. When the profit on the sum of participating pairs in the basket is x% of the total investment, everything will be closed and the EA will be ready for the next day.

I don't have to do anything. It will trade by itself everyday without my precense. Sorry that I cannot share the EA, cause it is full of other functions which are ment for me only - but here you have the strategy.

This is out of scope for this thread, so I will not touch the subject anymore - just letting you know how this thread can be used for something more.

By the way, the most significant bar in my Traffic Light is measured using moving averages as I desribed in my last post. And really - the code I made this morning is very simple. I suggest that you guys learn to program MQ4 youself. Your trading life will be very enrichent. Here is a couple of good channels that can teach you:

Been super busy this week and didn't have time to post this weeks results. The weekly default basket did not trigger so no trade this week. There were only 2-3 pairs so not enough to trigger the VB.

The daily set has also been kind of flat this week with less than +1% profit so far, but overall its up +11% since trading it live.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Hi northwind, thanks for joining in. You are using the EA in a very interesting way and I'm looking forward to see your results. It is definitely a different approach, but then again the EA is very versatile and can be used many different ways. I'm confident that with enough testing we can come up with a profitable long term approach.

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Hi RiskFighter, thanks for your suggestions, I am actually working on using a MA filter that will only validate pairs that fall in with the MA trend for that time frame.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
My take on it was no sucess. I could work with trailing SL etc. But I am too long from a good result, so I stop it now.

I take it that you know this command: iMA(NULL, PERIOD_M30, 20, 0, 1, 0, 1); , where you can choose the timeframe that you want to validate, without having the chart in that timeframe.

Try the pair combinations in this table.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Hi mrdfx,

You could also program dynamic correlation matrix for a couple time frames and have the EA open baskets with the most positive and most negative correlated pairs. Time frames would depend on how you want to use the EA, longer-term, intra-day or scalping.

This should put the EA trading in the same direction as price action.

All the best,

NW

Ok so there have been over 400 downloads of the current version 1.91 with hardly any feedback or comments so the assumption is that there are only a few guys using the EA, if that.

So I am thinking of closing this thread and suspending sharing of further developments and just keeping it for myself. There's no point in sharing something if everyone takes it and no one participates.

Now if you guys would like me to continue this thread and uploading new versions then like this post so I can see how many still want to use the EA.

There also needs to be more active participation so we can work and improve together.

Hi RisingSun, I have not experienced high CPU usage with the EA, its not very heavy. I am running a MT4 with the EA on 8 charts and there is no high CPU usage for me so perhaps it can be something else?

blam the last V1.91 still works, even I am still using it while I'm trying to get the data bug fixed. Its a minor bug and has not affected the EA from performing.

As I'm not a coder I'm dependent on another person to fix the bug for me which is taking some time as he is busy with other things with higher priority than my EA. I just have to be patient and wait till he gets around to fixing it.

In the meantime you can certainly use the EA for forward testing.

It looks like your broker uses a suffix + so you will need to add the suffix to the list of pairs in the EA settings. As it is now the EA cannot see the pairs due to the suffix. Also make sure you have all the 28 pairs visible in your market watch window.

I entered again on the same bar and the position was closed again.

Is it a margin allowance setting? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Margin does not appear to be reading.

Is it because of this?

You should also be banned from entering in the same bar.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
The EA has 2 options for money management, fixed lot of lots per balance. If you have a higher target and only a few pairs you would need to consider whether to close the basket manually or leave it to reach target. A we are trading a basket of pairs it is it not possible to use risk % for lot size.

If you set your close basket time to 0:00, your orders will be closed at the end of day (broker time) correct.

--- 帖子 #964 ---
I see the same pairs listed more than once, so I think you are trading the EA on more than one chart correct? Are you using a different magic number for each chart? This could cause a conflict with the EA.

The magic number is a unique value.

Maybe it's your operation since other EA's were also running.

Sir, reporting for duty to develop and test out viable daily basket options  Lets see if lessons learned from CCFp parts are also applicable here.

Loaded up EA and my idea of daily configuration and will report back my observations.

One question - do I see correctly that there is no option within EA (at the moment) to limit the number of pairs in real basket? E.g. if 15 pairs passes trend test and VB, then 15 will load up in RB?

Cheers,

I

I was surprised that Virtual Basket does not update itself during the VB run based on latest indicator data. Basically it just takes the snapshot of indicator settings at basket open time and then attempts to run with it.

As you can see it brings 2 problems:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

- Pairs which do not correspond to indicator settings delay the triggering of Real Basket (these rotten apples are down by -41pips in VB)

- When RB is finally opened with positive pairs, they have already done a lot of work and real basket stalls. This happened with todays RB - after opening it was at -100pips within 1 hour. Having started off with better run it would have been at -60pips only. But the day is young so lets see.

For future developments perhaps to consider two options for Virtual Basket:

1) Continuous update of VB during its run to capture most recent indicator data. This would probably solve automatically problem no 2.

2) Option to trigger RB only based on the Positive trade contributions in VB - to avoid losing momentum due to pairs in loss

Otherwise its very good and simple to use.

The indicator itself could use some upgrades e.g. to have option to use multiple of candles e.g. in order to fill the gap between 4H candle and D1 candle for instance in MT4.

Cheers,

First day with FTC daily basket is in the bag - started VB off early (20 minutes past London Open), very wrong time and had little hopes for 11 trade basket but it did well:

TP hit 2.5% (120pips)

Min DD 7%

Basket duration 7hrs

Risk 0.01/250

Will need to adjust time to market entry slightly for better timing.

Lets see where this experiment will take us

Question: how do you reset the EA? I wanted to stop the VB operation and use another timeslot. Even removing EA and placing back did not reset it and VB results continue to run.

EDIt: Found it - for reset you need to remove EA, go into MQL4\Files folder and delete file with name "virt9999" and reload EA.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Hi Ilvez, yes there is no limit on number of pairs, whatever pair is considered valid will be passed to the RB when the VB is triggered (if using the VB).

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Ilvez, the suggestions you have are the same as you are requesting for the CCFp EA.

I've got a few other ideas to work on with this EA and still doing some other minor bug fixes, lets see if something can be considered in future.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
Monday default basket VB did not trigger so no trade this week.

I've been experimenting on other open times for the weekly set and there seems to be a better open time emerging. It still need a cpl more months of forward testing, but so far so good and is up over 10% in the last month compared to 4% on the default basket. If it continues this way I'll update the default settings to the new time.

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Thanks and yes, the suggestions are the same as its basket trading. Basically trying to achieve both optimal basket configuration and making sure that we step on the train at the right time with good momentum in right direction.

Looking forward to the future improvements of the EA. Will continue experiment with daily baskets with FTC and report back here.

Hi  mrdfx,

It seems I am the only one thant cannot put the EA working.

For some reason it just apears the colored boxes (red and green) but it doesnt trade or alert.

Could you help me?

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Hi Agente, can you give more info? What settings you using?

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Hi mrdfx,

Thanks for checking in.

Thank you for sharing your creative ideas and great job developing the EA.

This is a great system if user has time to manage it.

I work full time and couldn't devote the time I felt was needed to do it justice.

My feedback:

There were a few issues I couldn't figure out how to get around.

Maybe you can come up with a way to deal with them.

1. Baskets only open when all lower time frames agree with the highest time frame.

By the time all TFs turned the same color many profitable runs were over, and basket opened too late.

2. The optimal time for EA to try to open a basket was a moving target.

Tried setting multiple EAs to start every few minutes around possible open times. This was hit-or-miss.

3. As mentioned before, if the lowest TF candles flipped up/down/up/down/up the EA could open 2, 3, or 4 times the number of trades - too many and too risky.

4. Too much hands-on management/intervention was required.

As the saying goes - "Your mileage may vary."

At least for me, these problems made for irregular results.

Thanks again for sharing.

All the best,

NW

Hi Northwind,

Been testing FTC for 1 week for daily basket trading and initial results are also mixed but lets see where it takes us.

Running following settings:

Risk: 0.01/250

SL/TP: 10%/2.5% (SL was set high to see potential boundaries for DD, more reasonable level is 4-5%)

VB upper trigger 30pips

TFs used: H1,H4,D1. Current Candle.

Tried various opening times around LO and NO.

2 days in profit, wiped out by 10% SL on long dragging basket is my weekly net result.

Observations so far for future pondering:

1) Daily candle trend accuracy depends where your broker timezone is. My daily candle starts with Asian session, for folks in US timezone the daily candle has started around FO/LO session. So basically the accuracy of basket triggering depends on your broker timezone. Is daily trend defined by London + NY Session, or is is it more often broken during then? Are H1 and H4 candles good enough confirmation + Virtual Basket to determine accurately price trajectory for following hours? Using any lower than 1H timeframe introduces a lot of noise and false signals because it takes only single datapoint from last say 15 minutes to determine where you would like to go with next hours.

2) There is always the risk for wrong signal or missing signal if price hovers around the open level of shortest TF. Using "Previous candles" gave way too horrible results many times in a row even to consider.

3) Yes, if market moves strongly in one direction - it can close basket in a minutes (like it happened when I tested other open times than LO). I have not had basket fall very quickly into nasty DD, which is somewhat good as well.

4) Manual intervention is needed, as with any EA.

I'll keep on testing for some more.

Cheers,

I

hi all,

most of you people open the basket at 5pm New York time or a few hours later, so it will just be wandering around in the Asian session.....do you think it would be wiser to open it near London open, where the trends most likely will continue?......

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Hey guys been super busy and forgot to update this weeks results.

It's been a mixed week with the daily sets taking some losses this week as can be seen on the TE.

The default weekly basket did not trigger this week so there was no trade, but the other weekly basket that I'm testing did hit TP. It is showing a lot of  promise and hopefully after a cpl more months I should have enough data to know if its a viable replacement time for the default weekly preset.

Have a good weekend FF.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Hi yonnie, yes according to the original strategy the basket is opened on a Monday night, going in the direction of the major trend.

I am actually testing a basket at LO and its doing well, but more testing is needed first.

This weeks default basket VB did not trigger so no trade this week.

The daily baskets have taken a few knocks this week taking out all previous profit. The market has been all over the place and it's been hard to find any decent trends to jump on, this could be due to the time of year, but its been a rocky week.

I'll keep the demo tests running through the holidays just to see how they perform, but I've stopped all live trading of the EA until next month.

Hi mrdfx, I used your EA from last year and when the year 2020 ended, it is expired. I updated with your lastest version 1.91 but can not add to MT4.

I found an error in the Experts tab like the screenshot.

I found the uninit reason 8 because of "This value means that OnInit() handler has returned a nonzero value"  (https://docs.mql4.com/constants/namedconstants/uninit)

Could you please check if there is anything can be fixed ?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Its taken 8 days for someone to realize the EA has expired.

I guess there's really not that many current users out of 757 downloads..

I have not posted a new version as I have decided to work on the bugs that's been affecting the true performance of the EA. Once its fixed I'll upload the new version with a new expiry.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Hi,

Thanks for your reply. I know it expired at the year ended but I busy with my another business so today I have time to update it. But when trying to do that, I see the issue so I ask for your help.

The EA is really good so I hope this will be fixed soon.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
hello guys,

this thread is about trading with the trend by looking at the monthly, weekly, daily and even 4H candles......after almost 1 day trading in the new week, we look if all TF`s are green or red and if so, we go long (if green) or short (if red).....

now the problem as I see it, is that the green pair might already have green candles in the previous 3 days and is ready for a correction.....it is always better to wait until the correction has played out and once the daily candle turns green again, we buy......you could enter immediately, or if the high of the green candle breaks or if the high of the last red candle breaks to get in early.

however this means it will not be an once a week system.....

for example with my broker monthly and weekly CH/J, E/U are down......last Thursday was up, Friday down and we sell first thing in the new week....both were profitable

monthly and weekly G/C, G/N and U/CH are up.....last Thursday was down, Friday up and we buy first thing in the new week.....2 losses, 1 profitable....

you could let it carry on for this week; after all you`re trading with the trend......

we have some other pairs where M + W TF are in agreement, but we`re waiting for the daily to turn around, so we keep an eye on those every day this week......

I would not consider the 4H TF to have any importance.....

alright guys, hope this helps somebody....

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
to follow on.....

after Monday`s close we have buy orders on C/CH, C/J, E/CH, E/J, G/CH, G/J, N/CH, N/J and S/J......

the monthly and weekly TF for all these pairs are up, and the daily just turned from down to up....

lets see what happens...

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
update....only S/J was a loser with a maximum loss of 27 pips.......the other 8 trades a profit of at least 25 pips per pair.....

mind you, this is just a rough trading method without giving much thought to the price action of each individual pair....

Hi mrdfx,

1:30AM you spend is GMT time or Broker time?

This seems to be the best time frame that you test.

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
Yes I started testing it after you told me it was the one that you were having better results.

I would not bother with 2:30 or 3:00 as I tested them some time back and they were not profitable long term. If you would like to add a new time slot you can perhaps a Monday daily time.

I took an idea from the CCFp thread which also trades baskets and opens the weekly baskets on a Monday during the London session so maybe trying one of those times might yield some interesting results?

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Hi dchongpro, all times are in broker time and my broker is GMT +3.

Its really interesting what differences in results there can be between brokers.

My default 23:00 basket did not trigger neither did the 01:30 basket. My daily basket test triggered and as finally turned into profit today after floating in DD.

This week I removed some weekly and daily presets that weren't doing very well and were pulling down the linked TE stats, so now we should start to see the profit turn back upwards.

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
This week, my 1am and 1.30am baskets fired, both went to full SL

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
This week was not the best for the weekly sets. 2 presets did not trigger and the 1:30 did and hit SL.

While it was open I noticed that there were 13 pairs in the basket and come LO most of them changed trend. This is an observation I've been seeing that happens from time to time, and that is that the trend does not continue into the next day.

This is what gave me the idea to try an opening time during LO the same like the CCFp basket strategy and so far that basket is up +16% compared to +8% and +2% of the other 2 weekly presets I'm testing. A few more months and I'll go live with it.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
I think its perhaps not so much as a trend change but what LO (and sometimes 30 minutes before LO) does quite a lot is closing the Asian gap e.g. stophunting Asian session after which true trend might return. Size of the stophunt can be anything from 25 up to 50pips. So it poses a challenge which timeframes to consider for a basket opening because this move is quite surely against last 4H candle. And using only 1H and 30M candles for opening a full basket might be too short term view.

Well, only forward testing only tells the full story.

And now for some good news.

I am finally getting around to fixing the minor operational bugs reported from last year. It took some time as the previous developer who originally helped me is too busy these days with others things, so I have now found a new developer from MQL5 to take over, and who is now busy with the EA so hopefully after 1-2 weeks I'll have a new fixed 100% working version.

I have removed the TE as I am doing multiple forward testing with the new version so the account stats are all over the place now.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
This week no weekly baskets triggered so no trading this week.

As for the the new version well that's coming along, most of the bugs are fixed, now I'm busy with forward testing to make sure that everything is fixed. It's been quite challenging actually to get certain things working as they should, but I'm confident we'll get it done.

So the new version is taking longer than expected. I had to fire the developer who was working on it as he did not have the experience to do what I asked even after he said he could do it. Finding a proper experienced developer on mql5 is truly a lottery as most of them are bullshit. So now I'm on the search for a new developer who can hopefully fix this EA and make everything the way I want it to be. I'll keep you guys updated.

Hi blam, the 2 EA's are not related at all so there is no worry about that.

I am working with xmess7 who has adapted one of his EA's to trade the US30 strategy. We are busy with live forward testing ironing out the last few bugs, and if he doesn't mind then I'll share it in the US30 thread.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
No trading this week. I have actually paused forward testing while I'm working on the new version of the EA.

I have found a new developer who says he can fix it, but lets see as I've heard this story before. I just hope he can do it as its starting to cost me more money than originally budgeted for with hiring these developers.

Great results!

Are you using any particular setting?

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
Yes, I'm using the major trading sessions for open basket times and higher timeframes with trailing profit

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
I would be very careful with your results, not to say "suspicious".

You trade with a capital of just 200 USD and open with a leverage of almost 1:100, where the broker allows up to 1:500.

This is ridiculous.

Regulations of modern countries allow today 1:30 leverage.

This is the reason why most of the modern countries do not allow to trade with your broker.

Try this strategy with a reliable broker (under UK, USA or Australian regulation) and show results then.

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!

Please replace V1.92 for this new version 2.0!!

This new version has been a long time coming. I went through multiple developers to try fix the last few remaining bugs and this is the final version with no current known bugs. Its been very frustrating at times and cost me a lot of money to fix, but its done and its working.

A number of bug fixes were done to improve the EA catching the correct prices at the set open time. You see as the EA is scanning 28 pairs concurrently, and due to the delay in the terminal receiving new ticks and the EA processing all the data, in some cases the EA was not getting the correct prices at the same time and hence giving wrong signals sometimes.

I tried to speed up this process as much as possible, but as long as there is a delay in MT4 receiving the new ticks and the processing time of the EA there will always be slight differences and this cannot be fixed. This new version is a lot faster than the previous one and catches the correct prices a lot better and more accurate.

I have set the expiry of this version for 31/12/2022.

As always if you guys noticed anything weird or picked up any bugs please give your feedback, thank you.

Post #1 updated!

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Many thanks for the new version mrdfx - am excited to see how it will do with the faster operation, over the upcoming months!

Season greetings brother pls I need your help I trade only one single pair USDCHF 4Hrs and I use fractals alert indicator ,the alert is stable and I have not had a losing day since I started using it , I also use pivot indicator for daily direction and set my TP at S1 or R1,but  to trade it I base my entry on the closure of 2 candles and made my entry on the 3rd because the diamond signal will sit on the 1st of the 2closed candles patience is the key, normally  I get 2signals in a day one may come  out  at London time and the other one at New York session, if we have a strong direction for the day the signal may be one all the way to New York closing if there's no signal  on 4hrs I won't trade. So from this explanation can you help me to make up an ea that can use the fractal alert signal to execute the trade? Sometimes the signal may arrive before day break while I'm still in bed thereby missing the London signal I want the ea to represent me. Will be grateful if you can assist me to make the New Year a profitable one and be a contributor to the success. Regards

Hey guys, so with the new updated version and with the new year just starting I will be doing some new tests and I linked the TE here for you guys to follow.

Taking in all the knowledge of the previous forward tests and also thanks to blamshakk's continuous forward testing I'll be testing out some new settings which should hopefully prove profitable.

I still encourage all of you to test and find your own settings and share your results, and together I know we will find a successful long term setting we can all use and make money in 2022 and beyond!

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Mrdfx:

Nice work; I'm on board!.

Will be doing some testing.

Krismitt.

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
Hello guys,

do you still use the Monday candle to fire a trade or went further from that?

I've had a similar idea. On a pair that's trending on W/D, find a session in history, when pumping is done - London/US - and enter according to PA there.

I didn't experiment with it yet.

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Yes that is still being used and tested among other weekly open times.

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
As I mentioned I linked a TE, but please remember this account is trading multiple weekly and daily settings, 9 weekly presets and 13 daily presets to be exact so at any one time there can be many open orders and the account balance/equity will fluctuate a lot.

Take today for example, some weekly presets hit SL which knocked over -20% down, so more than likely you will see a lot of choppiness as the daily and weekly presets trade. As time moves forward I will start filtering out the losers and keep the winners so in time it will look better.

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
this week my mon 8am, default 11pm and tue 2am baskets fired, all went to full SL

How did the respective drawdowns compare ?.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
Yup I had similar stats, last week did not go well for the weekly set ups, but the daily set ups did well and managed to pull back the account to BE.

Lets see how the rest of the month goes as the market returns to normal after the holiday season.

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
Hi friends,

Have been reading from the beginning of the thread (not done yet..).

Huge thanks to mrdfx and your priceless clear explanations!

I loaded the EA on a eurusd chart, with default settings, but no trades have opened this monday.

The journal doesn't state anything unusual.. should I change default settings?

Did everyone else open trades this monday ?

Thanks so much!

If there is any testing you would like to be done - i'm happy to try it!

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
The EA might not have opened if the VB did not trigger.

This week the default time of 23:00 did not open for me.

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
So the test account appears to be taking a beating lol.

I guess this is what happens when you have 22 separate charts open with 22 different test presets. If the account does not make it I'll cut the biggest losers and go again, slowly but surely filtering out the losing presets.

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Thanks so much for the reply mrdfx  really appreciate! I'll be following, thanks

--- 帖子 #1113 ---

This test account has been a good filter to find the settings that are not working good.

I will be removing some presets at the end of today to start filtering out the losers, and we should start to see the results improving from next week.

So I started doing some trimming up and have removed 5 test presets, so now I'm down to 17 total sets, 6 weekly, and 11 daily sets.

Lets see things go and I'll do more cleaning up as time goes slowly letting the winners rise to the top.

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
So it appears that making the cuts has improved the results of the account overall as the remaining presets start to recover the losses.

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
hello quite an amazing result did follow through from the beginning and this the added priming got the system kicking real good. please wanted o find out Trend indicator_LuXingMod_AUD -  open on its own on the chart like you have on page one i tried it on chart several time don't open

good evening. I'm new to the forum and just registered to follow these posts. congratulations to the author of the EA indicator. Monday will start using it. I have some questions to ask. in the set I just set a new percentage of TP plus the saize (0.03). I tried to do a test but I didn't get any results. someone could tell me why. thanks you are fantastic

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
thanks for the tip. but unfortunately I don't have much time to keep up with the graphs. I was looking for something like that. I repeat the post from before. EA set according to my prerogatives but during the test (over a month) did not produce any results.

What do you mean didn't get any results? Did the EA not open any orders? With such little info provided its hard to know whats wrong.

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
Yes you can use it independently however you like as its an indicator.

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
exact!! I downloaded the latest version of the program and the only thing I changed was the tp sl and I activated the trailing. then I simply did a test starting from 1-12-2021 until 27-01-2022. zero results now I try to post a screnshot of the set. maybe there is something wrong

Its good to see the account recovering as the losing sets get removed. Removed another 2 sets this last weekend so now down to 15 presets.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
[quote=mrdfx;13899077]È bello vedere che l'account si sta riprendendo mentre i set perdenti vengono rimossi. Rimossi altri 2 set lo scorso fine settimana, quindi ora sono scesi a 15 preset. [/Citazione]

Hello. can I ask you a question? what is the best set you are using? times and duration. I'm trying the default set but with daily duration. among the various tests I did I realized that if during the first day I have a big loss I can hardly recover it during the week (actually I never recovered it). so I start the sets at 20:50 -22: 50-23: 50-02: 50-05: 50.you?

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
There is no best setting, I am running multiple tests, but it is too soon to say what set is the best.

You are welcome to experiment and find what works good for you.

Hey blam, with all this time that you have been running your weekly forward tests, has any open time stood out to you as a profitable set?

I am running weekly and daily presets and the daily presets are doing a lot better letting me to think that its the better way to go.

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
hey mrdfx the overall winner by a margin is 2am, with a total of 915 pips accrued

I think you're right, maybe the weekly is not the way to go, as this is not a particularly high pip count given the length of the test

I'm interested to hear more about your daily settings. I know you (correctly) like to test over a longer period of time before sharing your findings. Do you know toughly when you might be in a position to share more details of your daily tests?

thanks,

blam

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
Funny enough on my side I removed the 02:00 setting as it failed to many times for me.

Its interesting that when I developed this strategy my original intention was for a weekly set up that could be traded on a Monday and left on its own to do its thing, kind of like a weekly set & forget similar to the CCFp strategy, something simple and time saving, but as things progressed and I started experimenting with daily settings they did a lot better, and you're in and out of the market on the same day.

Even now my top weekly set is at nearly +5% total profit so far, but my top daily set is at +14%, nearly 3 times more.

I will continue to forward test at least another 6 months before sharing any solid data, as things can change a lot.

If you interested in testing some daily sets you can try this config, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1, for the time frame settings and I am testing open times at every M15 interval starting from Frankfurt open to NY open and after.

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
Hi mrdfx, I want to test the EA for daily trade. Do you have a base template for this?

Here is my settings for the EA:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Have some questions:

If "Use lots per balance" is set to true, does it mean the "Lot Size" setting will be ignored and "Lots Per Balance" setting will be used instead?

Is it mandatory to run the EA on M1 chart? or any timeframe charts are fine?

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
Hi minview, apologies for the late reply.

Your settings look good.

Yes if lots per balance is used the EA will ignore the lot size and it will calculate the lot size based on the account balance.

You can use the EA on any chart time frame you like, it is not dependent on the chart time frame.
