Hey everyone, Ever heard of RBBM? It's short for Rubberband Model, a game-changer for traders who've been struggling to turn a profit. We're talking about taking those inconsistent traders and turning them into absolute powerhouses with some serious gains under their belt. Now, if you've been at this trading game for ages and still haven't seen any green in your account, there are basically two reasons why: You might just have a weird love for pain, getting a kick out of the struggle more than the cash. Or, you've been looking at the market all wrong. If you're nodding along to the first one, well, I kinda respect your resilience, but let's be real—you're more of a gambling enthusiast than a trader. And hey, no judgment, but maybe the "Trading Made Simple" thread is more your speed. But if reason number two hits home for you, stick around. There's some good stuff in this thread that might just change your whole trading game. Get ready to see things differently and maybe finally start making those gains you've been dreaming about. _________________________ Introduction to RBMM _________________________ The Rubberband Model (RBBM) offers a solid roadmap for understanding how markets work. It's like having a cheat sheet that helps traders make smart choices and estimate market shifts accurately. Once you've got a handle on it, you'll find yourself confidently steering your trades every single day, staying ahead of market trends. I use the term "Rubberband" to explain how markets move. Think of it like stretching a rubber band – it snaps back when you release it, right? This analogy paints a clear picture in traders' minds, helping them grasp how market dynamics work and making it easier to understand how prices move up and down. _________________________ Framework _________________________ In my personal trading experience, I've found that there's no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to timeframes. You're free to choose what works best for you, but based on my own journey, here are some recommendations. Timeframe Entry Timeframe: 15min Confluence Timeframe: Daily/4Hour Each Week, Phases start anew Wait before Monday to pass befor analyzing No Indicators are needed (but can be used) Not every Week/Instrument will give perfect Cycles. Markets arent perfect. deal with it. (dont worry, we will get to these Points) _________________________ Understanding the Rubberband Model _________________________ The RBBM breaks down market behavior into three clear phases, much like the different states a rubber band can be in: 1.1: Phase 1 - Default Phase: Think of this phase as the default setting, like when a rubber band is just sitting there without any tension. In market terms, it's when things are going sideways, without any clear trend one way or the other. 1.2 Phase 2 - Stretched Phase: Here, the rubber band is being pulled in one direction, much like when a market is on the move in a particular direction. It's when we see a clear trend forming. 1.3 Phase 3 - Bounce Phase: After being stretched, the rubber band snaps back, and similarly, in the market, we see a reversal or pullback in the opposite direction. This phase marks a shift in the trend or a temporary correction. In addition to the main phases, there's an intermediary stage, Phase 1.5 (or 3.5) - the Setup Stretch Phase. This acts as a kind of warm-up, giving us hints about direction without fully committing to the tension we see in the later phases. It's like the calm before the storm, signaling potential movement without going all-in just yet. Weekly Cycle BluePrint Central to the Rubberband Model is the Weekly Cycle Blueprint, a vital resource for traders navigating market intricacies. This blueprint acts as a roadmap, offering valuable insights into the cyclical patterns and trends that drive market movements throughout the week. Now armed with an understanding of the various phases, traders can leverage this knowledge to decipher daily market dynamics. Monday: Phase 1 - Default Phase [DP] Mondays kick off with traders digesting the weekend's news and events, setting the tone for the week ahead. This period is marked by a scramble to gauge sentiment, resulting in chaotic and unpredictable price movements. Trading during this phase is strongly advised against. The initial hours of Monday trading are often marred by erratic price action, making it unwise to rush into positions. Moreover, there's a psychological aspect to consider: after a weekend break from trading, there's a temptation to dive back in for a quick dopamine fix from executing trades. However, giving in to this impulse can spell trouble, leading to impulsive decisions, deviation from trading plans, and overall poor risk management. To counteract these tendencies, it's best to exercise restraint and refrain from active trading on Mondays. Instead, take a passive approach and spend time observing chart patterns. This not only cultivates self-discipline but also reinforces adherence to trading strategies, laying the groundwork for long-term success in navigating market volatility. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Tuesday: Phase 1.5 - Setup Stretch Phase [SSP] On Tuesdays, we step into the Setup Stretch Phase, where market momentum extends in a single direction with minimal pullbacks. It's crucial to tread carefully during this phase and avoid jumping the gun on reversal trades. The temptation to predict a market reversal grows as traders witness sustained momentum. However, giving in to these impulses is both futile and counterproductive. Trying to impose personal biases onto the market, like anticipating a reversal based solely on subjective assessment, is a common mistake. It's important to understand that the market operates independently of individual expectations. Believing that the market "has to" conform to a certain direction is wishful thinking. Traders must remain objective and refrain from projecting personal preferences onto market dynamics. While Phase 1.5 offers strategic trading opportunities, it demands a disciplined approach and adherence to predefined strategies. As we delve deeper into the Rubberband Model, we'll explore the best techniques for navigating Phase 1.5, seizing market opportunities, and effectively managing risks. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Wednesday: Phase 2 - Stretched Phase [SP] + Phase 3 - Bounce Phase [BP] On Wednesdays, we dive into the Stretched Phase, seamlessly transitioning into the Bounce Phase within the same day. This is when the market pushes to its limits, encountering resistance that hints at a potential reversal. Wednesdays are a goldmine for traders, often offering the week's best opportunities with the highest accuracy for trades. Personally, I've found Wednesdays to be so promising that I focus exclusively on trading during this day. In the next sections, we'll delve into trading strategies for Phase 3 and pinpointing entry points. Mastering these tactics will empower traders to seize the abundant opportunities Wednesdays offer, boosting their success in the market. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thursday: Continuation of Phase 3 + Phase 1.5 (3.5) On Thursdays, the market tends to stay on its path from the Bounce Phase before gradually shifting back into the Setup Stretch Phase. This signals a rebound after tension release, akin to a rubber band recoiling and stretching out again. During this phase, traders can capitalize on continuation trades stemming from Wednesday's bounce. Additionally, they can gear up for a mini-cycle repeat expected on Friday, marked by Phase 2, the Stretched Phase, as the market gears up for another round of extension. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Friday: Back to Phase 2 - Stretched Phase + Phase 3 - Bounce Phase Fridays often mirror the market dynamics seen on Wednesdays, returning to a fully stretched rubber band state. This presents traders with the opportunity to actively pursue Phase 3 Bounce Setups, rounding off the trading week on a positive note. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Full Weekly BluePrint Model (Example) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Summary of Weekly Blueprint: Phase 1 - Default Phase (Rubberband Relaxed): At the beginning of the week, the market behaves like a relaxed rubber band, absorbing weekend news and events. Price action is chaotic and directionless, making it wise to refrain from trading to avoid unpredictable movements. Phase 1.5 - Setup Stretch Phase (Rubberband Initial Stretch): Following the Default Phase, the market gradually extends in one direction without major pullbacks. This phase serves as a warm-up, indicating potential movement before significant shifts occur. Phase 2 - Stretched Phase (SP) (Rubberband Fully Stretched): Midweek, the market reaches its maximum extension, resembling a fully stretched rubber band. While opportunities abound, traders must be cautious as resistance increases, signaling a potential reversal. Phase 3 - Bounce Phase (Rubberband Release and Rebound): After the Stretched Phase, the rubber band is released, leading to a bounce or reversal in the opposite direction. Thursdays focus on continuation trades from Wednesday's bounce, while Fridays aim to identify bounce setups to conclude the week. Weekly Cycle Blueprint : The Weekly Cycle Blueprint offers insights into cyclical market patterns and trends. By understanding these phases through the rubberband analogy, traders can navigate each stage effectively, making informed decisions and maximizing profitability. There is a lot more to come, but I am going to end it here for now. We will be slowly adding things.

Very nice thread, I've applied to some random days and what you say rings true. Some question in screen prints

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hey! Yes in most cases the Thursday push should be in the direction of the Wednesday bounce. Of course the Market isnt always doing what you want it to do. I called it in the first Page that the Weekly Blueprint is a Pattern.... but that might People give the idea that this is how the Market HAS to move. Its just something that happens OFTEN . The great thing is.. you dont need to get all Phases right.. in fact... you might be fine to trade only one specific Phase during the Week. Here is a Trade I took this Wednesday. My favourite Setup - Wednesday Phase 2 + 3 Attached Image (click to enlarge) But here is how it went the next Day. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There are Variations that can be used, if things dont look perfect. But we will get to those. You dont need all Phases to be correct, to earn a lot of money. EDIT: LOVELY CHART!! You already see the potential Variations which CAN be used. I am a believer you dont need to Trade every Day or Week... but thats why I have created Variations.. so Traders can Trade most Weeks.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yes, no? Just want to make sure i understand before deep diving haha, thank you

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Yes, correct. This is a perfect full scheme of the RBBM + Weekly Blueprint Now if you add things like Asian Range you can get a better visual of whats happening..... (we will get to that part)

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Awesome, Look forward to learning your system and seeing more of your trades! Good stuff

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Using bar replay, went back and took some simulated live trades... just using 200 BB bands to really highlight stretching and bouncing conditions

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Another simulated live trade..wow

--- 帖子 #13 ---
The Market can be as complicated or as easy as you want it to be! Others are marking up their charts.. do COT and sentiment research... read about upcoming news and what not... I use a Rubberband. Keep it simple. Delete the unnecessary. That's why the RBBM can change a Traders perspective and turn losing Traders into profitable ones. You wont always win. You wont always be right. But you will make a big damn amount of money, if you take the time to learn it. (Not specifically directed at you) Well done incorporating simple tools to make it easier for you. You are already taking the correct steps.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Love the simplicity! Lots to learn Here's another example of variation I came across simulating live trades during back testing. Wednesday didn't have a bounce phase, or alternatively Tuesday had an extended stretch phase (however you interpret it), so Thursday I was anticipating a bounce, and considering Thursdays usually continuations of the bounce I knew I could set a larger take profit...

Found a great way to identify markets that meet stretching criteria so we can cycle pairs at a glance for setups. Instead of 200BB, I'll be using a trending RSI; if the RSI is oversold (breaking down outside of the bands) then we can say the market has successfully stretched down and vice versa for overbought conditions. An example of just one of the trade variations you could use.. So logically, we'll be looking for the RSI to become OS/OB to detect the market stretching on Tuesday and Wednesday. Once this happens we can start to look for the RSI to break outside the bands in the opposite direction to detect a bounce For example if the market has stretched down Tuesday, crossing down over the band, and then again early on Wednesday then we can confirm both stretching phases are now complete. NOW we can start to look for the RSI to be come overbought initiating the "bounce phase" where we can short the market back down.

The Difficulty starts on Monday Now this is the tough Part Trading the RBBM... you dont Trade on Monday! You seek your dopamine rush entering Trades after a long 2 Weekend break of this rush. But you arent allowed to do so. Stay Strong fellas

This is why I call this the Default Phase and I am not Trading Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is where the bored Traders start searching for stupid Trades on lower timeframes and go "wtf?! This Market is so bad!! I lost all my gains from previous days"

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Let’s see what the market gives us today

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Morning...Let’s see..

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Better to wait for the extention on Wednesday A simple thing to remember is.. the more the Rubberband is stretched the more likely it is to bounce and the bigger the bounce will be. But you need to look at those days also individually. When you took the Trade, did it extend (stretch) on that given Day? Its all about probablity.

Mental Lesson - Beyond RBBM: Embracing the Trading Rollercoaster Let's talk about something real important as we dive into this trading style: the whole deal with control. We humans, we hate feeling like we're not in charge. So, naturally, we try to wrestle control over something as wild as trading. But here's the kicker: trading's like tossing a coin. Your job? Find a coin that's slightly weighted in your favor – a setup that fits your plan. Once you've taken the plunge – made the trade – that's it. It's like tossing that coin; once it's in the air, it's out of your hands. Now here's where it gets real: after you've thrown that metaphorical coin, take a chill pill. Remind yourself that you've done your part. The rest is up to the market. Whether it swings your way or not, keep your cool. If it doesn't, focus on the next shot. Your job ain't to control every trade's outcome, but to keep aiming for setups that give you the best odds. So, embrace the chaos, my friend. With every coin toss, learn, adapt, and keep honing your skills. Remember, you got this!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Is it a better gamble to use the stretching phase from Tuesday that ran into Wednesday continuation? (Blue box) as opposed to stretching that took place earlier in the day? (Green box)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
USD/CAD is a tough example to give, as it goes a bit beyond the RBBM the USD/CAD Trade is a Trade that should be best taken by someone who already is very comfortable with the concept and has been Trading it for a while. Here is my try to put my experience into words. I have been Trading this way for several Years already and of course know the ins and outs. The USD/JPY Trade was the better Setup to take... but I didnt get an Entry Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Does every Monday start with the default phase? In other words, is the weekly cycle repeating itself each week?

Yes each Week starts again with Phase 1

--- 帖子 #42 ---
on average I take 2-3 Trades a Week I dont trade many Pairs/Instruments and I personally focus on Wednesdays the most for the best Setups (to me). In Trading... often less is more.

Why I use 2 Different colour Schemes ? maybe someone is wondering why I use 2 different colour schemes, here is the Reason Dark Template -&gt; lets me focus better on the RBBM/Cycles as everything is a bit more "faded" Light Template -&gt; lets me focus better on Price Action/Candles as the Candles stand out more (to me) This is just how my Brain works... of course try it out if you want to, but it might not help you the same way it does for me. _____________________________________________ Tomorrow is a Holiday, so I will be using the time to explain a few more things....

you like saint for me.. its awesome. i want to learn this perfect, ins and out. and want to focus only on wednesday. few points : 1.how to know which side stretches will happen as we only trade bounce 2. how to know stretch/bounce started and when finished. i mean after a stretch how to know this is bounce started 3. do you call upward fast move as a stretch or even if it move downward fast move do you call stretch too? 4. last usdcad (you tool entry)stretched upside then moved downside(bounced) my question, how do you know it will stretched upside, it might stretched downside too, in this case did you trade for upside move? thanks

Yesterdays test turned my work more than I expected...thanks my friend for your knowledge..

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hey! 1. We dont know, our job is not to predict whats going to happen, we react when its happening/after it happened 1.1 We also dont need to only Trade the bounce, for Phase 1.5 I wrote on Post 1 how there is rarely any Pullback happening.. maybe you find a setup there? 2. You dont know when the Bounce happens, you can use many things known to you such as sup/res etc to figure out a good timing.. I will teach you at some point my way of doing it. 3. A stretch is a stretch, doesnt matter whether its to the upside or downside. (Think again of a Rubberband) 4. Again I didnt know that its going to stretch up, I just had a Plan in mind IF it does. Dont Predict. React. Its unlikely that I would have taken a buy if it stretched down, it didnt fullfill my Cycle idea. I want to make clear that this is a lot more a Model rather than a System. I am giving you the opportunity to see the Market through the Eyes of someone who has been Trading for a long time. Its a different perspective. The best perspective. For me.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Asian Range - Ease your Mind As promised I am going to explain why I use the Asian Range Many Traders use the Daily open Line as an important factor whether the Market is bullish or bearish. (Above the Open - Bullish / Below Open - Bearish) The Asian Range is to me something very similar... but a lot more. 1. It shows you Visually the new starting Days, which is very beneficial for reading the Phases of RBBM 2. the Asia Session is in most cases a narrow Range from where Price Stretches away from during London open or latest NY open, now you already have a visual cue on from where and when we can expect a Stretch to happen 3. The Range is consistent based on Time and not subjectively drawn by the Trader 4. As any other Range, you generally dont want to Trade inside of it.. because.. well.. we are in a Range. Once we break out from the Asian Range you can expect generally some volatility 5. Often times when the Asian Range is large (a lot of movement during Asia) the Market will move rather strangely/different from usual, so this can either be a warning for you to be careful or you take it as a sign to not trade this Pair for the day. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Simplicity is Key... sometimes a box based on a specific Time is all you need.

Hey BDfx77! EUR/USD - Had no RBBM Cycle You could find a Variation of those Cycles on EUR/USD, but this is not something I want to get into right now. Focus on identifying the perfect RBBM Cycles, like on USD/JPY this week and on nothing else. Adding too many things at once, before you have understood the basics will get you confused. I will be giving out each Week new informations on how to Trade RBBM.. take it slow, it will be worth it. trust the proccess.

Wrong Mentality From childhood, we're taught that hard work pays off, leading to success and freedom. But in trading, this idea gets twisted. Instead of seeing hard work as a path to wealth, we start believing that trading a lot equals making a lot of money. Unfortunately, this often leads to losing money instead. The more trades we make, the more likely we are to mess up and end up paying high fees like commissions, swaps, and spread/slippage costs. Brokers actually encourage this by offering accounts with no spreads but with high commissions, tempting traders into a cycle of losing money through excessive trading. But here's the thing: you don't need to trade a lot to succeed. Just one smart trade per week could potentially make you wealthy. Even a small 2% profit from one trade can add up to big gains over time. So, instead of focusing on making lots of trades, focus on making smart ones. Quality over quantity is what really counts in trading. If you start with an intial balance of 100k and make 2% a Week, you will have a balance of 313,842.84 Next Year.... 984,973.27€.. congratz you are a millionair in just 2 Years.

From my backtesting experience wed,tue and Thu days have a best set up. sometimes Friday bounce occurs but I want to prefer(just my favorite days) wed, tue and thu. also I was notice a lot of variations.

I have Tradingview but do not use it. So for MT4 I find the Williams Percent Range very usefull. When passing the -50 level a shift i trend might come. Look how nicely it gave signal to trades on tuesday and thursday according to the RBBM setup. I gave it a 40 periode here - without any thoughts, it must be analyzed. It is found in MT4 at the Qocillators menu. I have Parabolic SAR on the chart. This enables a nice way to trail using the dots. Note tha SAR is only working when the price get a spark, but that is exactly what RBBM does. If there is a large interest in a robot that trails the SAR dots and sell when hitted, then I can make one. I think thar JPY and CHF pairs are nice for this strategy. Is that right?

There is problems with Metatrader (MT4 and MT5) in the Prop trading world. That hit me last week. I have a live Prop account which I cannot use any longer with MT4.

I have to admit, that normally I am a lousy manual trader, but with this tool I might have chance. Vielen Dank mein freund.

It works on any Instrument really. You just need to find one which has decent Phases. I personally trade mostly GU/EU and Gold for example. they are just very liquid, thats why I like them. the Pip Value is low on CHF pairs, so commissions arent worth it to me.

How to Trade the extention Phase (1.5) We're in what we call the default Phase right now, which basically means we're not making any trades. Yeah, I know it can be tough to resist the urge, especially when Mondays roll around. Some Mondays, like today, things seem to be all over the place, while others are as quiet as a mouse. That's why we steer clear of trading on Mondays. They're just not reliable. Now, for a lot of traders, this can be a real challenge. They'll see those big swings and think, "Man, if I had just made a trade today, I would've scored big." But then, more often than not, they'll end up regretting it when they lose out on the next three Mondays in a row. The market? Yeah, it can be brutal. It's quick to humble you and show you just how clueless you can be. Back to the initial Topic. As I have already explained in the first Post, usually on Tuesdays we can get a big one directional stretch (the intial stretch) without major pullbacks. So now you gotta ask yourself... how the heck could I be able to Trade this? If you read through my earlier post about the Asian Range you might get an idea... I will share an Image..

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Here is a EUR/USD Trade Setup that I was looking at this Morning Attached Image (click to enlarge) Does it suck not to get that Trade? Yes Do I regret not taking it? No Why? Because its my Job NOT to Trade on Monday, long term I am getting PAID not to trade Mondays, because I know how most other Mondays are looking like and I know how easy it is on Mondays to jump early into stupid trades. This is why its a Rule, The Rule is there to proctect my Account.

EURUSD is looking ideal for me today Monday consisted of mostly consolidation outside of a couple massive news candles. Tuesday seemed to have stretched nicely Wednesday also recently has stretched past Tuesdays highs sweeping Asia session I’ll look for a structure break to the downside for a short opportunity..

@UST What do you think about AUDJPY? On Wednesday we just had an upward stretch to 150%ADR. Based on model we should get another stretch to upward before Friday decline. Correct?

hi UST. What is with this Asian session range? I could not see any clear direction from you in your posts about it but I see everyone is drawing them. Is it possible that you write one detailed post about what to watch specially on Wed and Thu? I mean maybe its just me but the system is like a riddle so far and I am trying to make sense out of it. Please do not reply with 'read post 1' or something. I have read that 20 times already. Please see if it is possible to make a detailed post about how to operate with this system. Otherwise disregard my post .. no hard feelings.

Thursday Bounce Continuation Setup..

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Wednesday's stretch still running on gbpjpy, waiting for sell setup

--- 帖子 #131 ---
For the Asian Range explaination - Visit RBBM - Road to Success | Page 3 | Forex Factory Post 54 Wedesdays I look for a Reversal after it streched and broke the Asian Range.. Tuesday I look for a continuation of Wednesdays Reversal in very simple Terms... Try to visualize a Rubberband and imagine how the band stretches.. at some point the Band will reach its limit and bounces back, thats the part that I mostly Trade. You can also Trade the stretch itself.. I just personally dont do it often, because my brain works better for Reversals. Summary of Weekly Blueprint: Phase 1 - Default Phase (Rubberband Relaxed): At the beginning of the week, the market behaves like a relaxed rubber band, absorbing weekend news and events. Price action is chaotic and directionless, making it wise to refrain from trading to avoid unpredictable movements. Phase 1.5 - Setup Stretch Phase (Rubberband Initial Stretch): Following the Default Phase, the market gradually extends in one direction without major pullbacks. This phase serves as a warm-up, indicating potential movement before significant shifts occur. Phase 2 - Stretched Phase (SP) (Rubberband Fully Stretched): Midweek, the market reaches its maximum extension, resembling a fully stretched rubber band. While opportunities abound, traders must be cautious as resistance increases, signaling a potential reversal. Phase 3 - Bounce Phase (Rubberband Release and Rebound): After the Stretched Phase, the rubber band is released, leading to a bounce or reversal in the opposite direction. Thursdays focus on continuation trades from Wednesday's bounce, while Fridays aim to identify bounce setups to conclude the week.

Hello, first of all, thank you for everything you contributed to this thread. I understand the cycle from Monday to Friday, but if we see the range instead of Monday, Tuesday, for example, and it goes up on Wednesday and then again, would you look for the rebound on Friday? I mean when it doesn't go as it should from Monday to Friday it could be Wednesday the range and Thursday and Friday it goes up and the following Monday the rebound

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi UST, thank you for sharing this system. usually around which session on Wednesday do the bounce happen in your experience, and which pairs work best?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hey, usually the bounce happens either around the london open or NY open. I wouldn't trade too late into the Day as Forex most of the time dies there and goes into zombie mode. There is no best Pair.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Maybe... ;-) You are writing about a variation.... we will get to that this week.

Good afternoon. I´ll try. Please donot forget we come from a long easter holiday weekend. Monday was closed in the Europe and UK had a bank holiday. So the Tuesday is in my kind valid as on first post explained for mondays: " Mondays kick off with traders digesting the weekend's news and events, setting the tone for the week ahead." Hope that helped Guido

--- 帖子 #156 ---
This is not ideal formation. It's one kind of variations. stretchings may be up or down/ long or short. Important point is we need to differentiate stretch and bounces phases.Hope get it helpful.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Great going guys ! Love to see the discussions and people trying to help each other out. Discussing and Teaching are the best ways to deepen your own knowledge

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hey UST, you´re the reason I finally registered here! First of all, thanks for your awesome explanations! I think this method sounds quite interesting and I want to give it a shot too! So here are my thoughts for this weeks EURUSD, maybe you can take a look into it and tell me if I had some correct thoughts on this. Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Algorithmic Levels Part 1 - Previous Weekly/Daily High/lows This shouldnt be anything new to most Traders, but nontheless I havent really touched upon levels we could use to anticipate the bounces. So here we go with Part 1. Previous Daily and Weekly highs and lows are very important levels in Trading, simply because most Traders are looking at that level. Doesnt matter whether you swing trade on High Timeframes or scalp on low timeframes. These levels are used by all type of Traders. I wont be going into liquidity and what not right now, as everyone got already completely brainwashed by certain other popular tradingstyles and I dont have the patience currently to deal with that. So all thats important to know is.... that these levels are very important as many eyes are watching them. Both from Retail and Institutional standpoint. The High and Lows of the prev. Daily and Weekly Candle can be used for several things: They can be used as "Magnets" where Price wants to go They can be used as Targets (see 1st Point why) They can be used as Bounce Areas, as you will find strong reactions from the Market there. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Watch how the Market either reacts on those Levels or how the Market does a stretch and then moves straight into the Daily lows... The same thing you will see with Weekly and Monthly Levels

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hey Piraka. Appreciate that I am the reason you registrated. It's an honor. Your thoughts on this are good. If you are taking Entries based on BOS... I would suggest maybe looking at a 5minute timeframe. If you enter on 15BOS you will find yourself entering rather late, but play around with it. I might later this evening give an advice how to manage the trade. Depending if I find the time. Cheers

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hey UST! I have a question should we trade in stretch or wait for bounce if we trade for bounce then we will be doing short everytime? and as well it will be difficult to find position like one or two in a week!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Why would bounces be only short? Just so happened that the setups last week were on the short side. A stretch is a stretch, doesnt matter its direction. I already mentioned and explained that you can also trade the stretch in previous posts. As you havent really traded that model yet... I doubt you know whether you will get many setups or not. With the Model I gave you 4 out of 5 days that you could theoretically trade. Of course I dont know how many are many for you. I suggest reading through the whole thread. It's worth it.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hope you all were good Traders and didnt trade today See you tomorrow.

Good morning, at the moment only eurgbp made a range on Monday

--- 帖子 #172 ---
You are focusing too much on Mondays and when a Cycle DOESNT move how its "supposed" to move. Instead of just looking at Pairs that do move how we want it to move. Also I have written that you should mostly ignore Mondays. Doesnt matter if it ended up moving more than it "should" or not... essentially the Cycles start at Tuesday. lets give an example outside of RBBM. Now lets say you looked for a Short Trade on EU today, but there wasnt any setup. Would you still try to take a Trade? Hopefully not. IF the Cycle isnt there, then there is just no Setup to Trade... (besides the true Cycles have only started today...) WATCH WHAT HAPPENS NOW THAT WE HAD 2WEEKS WHERE MONDAY MOVED MORE THAN USUAL AND TRADERS WANT TO FIND REASONS TO TRADE MONDAYS TOO. THIS IS WHY YOU ARE NOT PROFITABLE. YOU ARE SCARED TO MISS OUT ON MOVES, YOU ARE ITCHING TO TRADE EVEN IF I SAID NOT TO TRADE ON MONDAY.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Well done Pinoy! Pinoy and Gleam are doing well... watch their Charts... they will show you what the RBBM does to your trading, if you just follow the rules..

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I am not scared to miss moves. I just wanted to clarify if we see those big, one-sided moves made on Monday means that pair has no setup for the week?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
If the cycle only starts on Tuesdays, and we are supposed to ignore Mondays, how did you know which direction the stretch setup goes to? Eg. Eurusd. I know we are not supposed to trade on Mondays, but do we also ignore the information there totally too? Asking questions for clarification only, still learning, please no hard feelings.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Ignore monday - it does not exist. The direction on tuesday is given from the break out of the asian market. Buy acording to the trend that is given. Make a trendline as the support and exit when the trendline is broken. Also look at other support and resistances on the chart.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
And now comes wednesday. If the stretch went north on tuesday it should continue north on wednesday. But expect maybe a ranging asian market and trade on the break out. Later wednesday the trend should be broken into the opposit direction. This starts the new direction which should continue thursday - of cause maybe with a range asian market on thursday also.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Thanks RiskFighter! That clarifies that part! Just wanted to clarify as UST said that Monday is when the rubberband is at the "default phase" or not moving in a clear direction, but I see many pairs with big, one-sided moves. Do we avoid trading these pairs for the rest of the week as they don't follow the rubberband pattern?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Well - UST has mentioned about what to do, when pairs are not behaving as expected. We are waiting for that lecture.

That's amazing, UST! May I know any signal you look for entries? So that you can enter at the best price? As for Tuesday, will you take any breakout trade from consolidation? In case price failed to bounce, will you trade the continued stretches? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Trendlines gives the signals. However UST - how would you trade the thursday? I think I would not trade it. If there are not a clear trend South at NY, then it is forbidden land. Right? Or can we trade it when Asien trend is broken South??

--- 帖子 #216 ---
By the way you also have a Double Top, which is a very strong confirmation of the wednesday South adventure has started.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
When to enter a Trade - Timing Timing Timing Certainly, here's a revision of your initial text with minimal changes: No matter what way you're trading, the time of day will always be a very important factor in your trading. And if it wasn't important before, it definitely should be now. For FX, I have two different Entry Time Zones (ETZ). The London (LETZ) period is from 8 am to 11 am, and the New York (NETZ) period is from 2 pm to 4 pm UTC+2 Time. This is when the market moves the most in general, and as traders, we want and need the volatility it provides when entering a trade. During the London and NY open, a lot of money flows into the market, giving us a lot better opportunities than at any other time. When analyzing a chart during the ETZ's, I use a checklist: How far have we moved away from the Asian Range? Have we hit Previous Daily/Weekly highs/lows? Are we at Support/Resistance from HTF? How far have we moved looking at ADR (we get back to this, once I finished coding a script) Now, I'll elaborate more on Point 1: If we haven't moved far from the Asian Range, but a Setup is present (details below Point 1), then I opt for a tighter SL. If we have moved far from the Asian Range and a Setup occurs (details below Point 1), then I choose a wider SL. Here's why: If a setup forms near the Asian Range, the market is less likely to make deep stretches or bounces. It often follows a zigzag pattern before deciding its direction. If a setup occurs far from the Asian Range, we're likely to see a large move (Wednesday bounce/Thursday continuation). However, timing entry on these is trickier due to market fluctuations. This approach helps avoid early entries, which can be detrimental. Thus, I choose a wider SL. Additionally, since we expect a larger move, it's beneficial and allows for potential position additions. What's my Target (TP)? My default TP is 2R of my initial Entry/TP, meaning if I risk 1%, I aim for 2%. If there's a closer target that makes more sense, I opt for 1.5% instead. It's simple math that works in our favor. This strategy aligns with the principle of "cut losers short, let winners run." You don't need to exit a trade early if it goes negative; instead, focus on maintaining a positive Risk-Reward Ratio. You can use anything else of course as confirmation.. whether its a Trendline or something else. I personally like to get an Entry as early as possible, because that gives me the chance to have a wider SL in exchange. This is again where the Rubberband logic comes into play... If you are able to enter early into the bounce (as an example) then you can have a wider SL, as you got a good price to enter on. So now with a wider SL, you give the Market the chance to move further into the "wrong" direction, which makes the Band stretch more.. till it bounces.. if it already stretched far... how much further can it go? Likely not too far.. but this way you give the Market a bit of a playground. Worse case.. you have your SL in place. - Thursday continuation I usually look for a pullback above/below the Asian Range so as an example.. GU bounced on Wednesday to the downside.. so I am looking for a short Trade on thursday.. what I wait for then is a push above the Asian Range. See what happens depending how far we go outside the Asian Range.. See what happens when we enter ETZ's... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yes exactly same question I understand entry point for Wednesday but not the other 2 for Thursday.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
watch post above

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I entered on GBPCAD on Thursday (#Post 210) due to: 1. Having a clear direction from the Wednesday Bounce. 2. Having a clear Support turning into Resistance. Also, I know you are asking about GBPUSD, but I thought I would share. Usually what I notice is, for a currency, like GBP here, there will be one pair that shows a "super clear, very textbook" pattern for that week, and the others are not so clear. Try to find the one that is clearest to you and focus on that... a reminder for me too

--- 帖子 #243 ---
First of all thank you so much for this eye opener thread I swear I had an epiphany last weekend I couldn't eat for almost 2 days (intermittent fasting) just going over the charts Backtesting over and over the whole weekend my conclusion is I think you dropped this king . Since I'm an active trader I can accurately enter the market correctly 60% of the times overall of a 100 trades and I have the psychological skill to hold my winning positions for a long period of time. With all that been said I always end up giving back all the profits and more the reason is I have 3 key problems and I know them very well, first of all I cut my losses way too early that turn to profit 50% of the time, ending up going in the same direction after taking that loss, I martingale my risk after each loss by 1.2X since I don't know what is my target so I want to cover it as soon as possible it goes in my favor and the last one which is literally my profit killer more often than I wish once my original trade goes in my favor I try to trade reversals and corrections ending up with zero profits on both trades I tried to find psychological solution to this but it's not easy when you don't know how the market is going to behave and I've failed over and over. With your RBBM cheat sheet it showed me that based on my trading style I better get entries on Tuesdays only because I can find early entries with minimal losses and since I know using your RBBM Tuesdays have minimal reversals but one clear direction more often over long period of times so therefore it would be stupid of me to trade reversals all I need fight for my entries on Tuesdays hold them till Wednesday watch for those sneaky bounce before they happen get my partial profits 70% of the position size hold 30% of the positions for that juicy push on Friday in case it happens if it doesn't SL at BE. I hope you don't take my post as deviation from your original post but I honestly think that's what suits as who I'm and how I trade.

RBBM - Variation - Plan B - Delayed Phases Variation Plan B is essentially when on any given day the Market moves inside a Range instead of stretching out as we normally want it to happen. So lets say on Tuesday instead of a stretch we get a Range. Now Phase 1.5 is delayed for 1 Day and comes during Wednesday the next day.

Hey Michael! Nice to see you being around again! About the heavy news... this is exactly what we are going for on a Wednesday. We wait for the stretch before the news happen (with the condition of the setup stretch phase 1.5) and then we look for a bounce opportunity best case BEFORE the news happen. If you got time.. go through the charts posted in here.... you will notice something interesting on those wednesday setups.... the Market is predictable to an extend.. if RBBM model is used. Thats all I will say.

Hi All, I have been a silent follower of this thread and have read some interesting posts from UST and those who have managed to understand his trading style well. I have understood some of it but we learn each day. I placed a trade yesterday during London session on Gold. I mostly trade reversals on 1 minute time frame but it is quite stressful. This was my first trade using UST's method. As most here I ignored Monday and saw movement or trend on Tuesday. It was quite a decent drop and then yesterday more of a drop during Asia session. Mid London session was where I decided to enter as I saw potential for upward movement. Looking at other charts I still at times get confused when it comes to placing trades cos there is an extension of trends on Wednesdays and the actual setup appears on Thursday. Any input is appreciated as its still a learning process for me. Trade well All.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
First you gotta understand the difference between Analysis Trading Strategies and Entry Trading Strategies. I consider RBBM very special and close to my heart because its an Analysis Trading Strategy through pattern nothing else nothing more, it offers an opportunity to see the markets from a different perspective in terms of patterns repeating itself over and over with higher probability for it to be successful, therefore what you're asking from RBBM is completely wrong, because it's not an Entry Trading Strategy, if you want one you gotta go with a 100's of them offered here on this lovely forum. To summ it up when RBBM pattern aligned perfectly: 1. Monday = chaos no trend just consolidation. 2. Tuesday = clear trend to the upside or downside. 3. Wednesday = open with continuation of whatever Tuesday trend was. "The outcome of all that an expected bounce on Wednesday, anytime any minute any hour." Now when all of this happen the road map of RBBM done it's job here, showed you exactly what's going to happen next, nothing else nothing more, don't ask more of RBBM that don't offer, stick to it and I promise you'll be a very successful trader. So stating the obvious when RBBM done its job, it's then when you use your arsenal of Entry Trading Strategies that you're an expert of and familiar with and try to find that bounce. As simple as that i hope it's clear for everybody now. Thank you UST

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Thanks for the reply but i was not asking for a specific entry or anything. All i asked was for an input on the trade i took. Anyways, all good. There are ways to come up with replies. Have a good day.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
You edited your post, you did ask "when I should enter on Wednesday as there was multiple extensions during that day" and what was wrong with the way replied I replied very politely, you asked for input I replied with my input, I didn't curse you or call you an idiot or stupid did I? you're being very sensitive for no reason.

Lesson Beyond Trading - Mental Game Trading isn't just about numbers; it's about your mind too. Let's talk about two important parts: your conscious and subconscious. Your conscious mind is what you're using right now to understand these words. It's where you make logical decisions in the moment. Now, your subconscious mind is more like the silent partner. It's in charge most of the time, making about 99% of your choices without you even realizing it. For traders, knowing how these two parts work together is key. While your conscious mind helps you plan, it's the subconscious that drives your actions during trading. Understanding how your subconscious influences you can lead to better decisions and more successful trading. Here is a simple example how the subconcious mind ruins your balance. Imagine you've been trading stocks for a while, and you've developed a strategy based on careful analysis and research. However, deep down, you have a fear of missing out (FOMO) on big market moves. Your conscious mind tells you to stick to your strategy and be patient, but your subconscious fear of missing out starts to creep in. You see other traders making quick profits on a stock that's surging, and suddenly, you feel the urge to jump in, ignoring your original plan. You buy in at the peak, hoping to ride the wave, but the stock quickly reverses, leaving you with significant losses. What just happened? Your subconscious fear of missing out took over, overriding your rational decisions. Without even realizing it, you abandoned your strategy and fell victim to emotional trading, ultimately sabotaging your trading account. In this scenario, the subconscious fear of missing out led to impulsive actions that were contrary to your trading plan, resulting in financial losses. It's a classic example of how the subconscious mind can wreak havoc on your trading account without you even noticing until it's too late.

I just buy again... it will break high for today and retest fibo 61.8 but my TP is below fibo

--- 帖子 #427 ---
There are a number of potential setups this week, but most have not crossed the trendlines and are thus not complete yet for me. A couple that has crossed... even then I will wait a bit before going live. NZDUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) USDCAD Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #428 ---
somehow gbpusd and usdcad likely a mirror for a moment, so when usdcad start bounce, the gbpusd will follow bounce too. perhaps 1.2512 - 1.2525

--- 帖子 #429 ---
YES, It will bounce earlier or later, need right moment to jump in...

--- 帖子 #430 ---
the pink box (asia range) looks like break out indicator so many times... after break out with it will continue scratch and then bounce...

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I like to use the Asian Ranges as a support/ resistance levels too, since price tend to consolidate and move slowly there. Price will tend to do a liquidity grab of that range, then go the other way, usually on Wednesdays' London and/or New York. Not always though.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
go go go, if it can reach 1.2505, i will close all my buy ...little profit but more safety because sooo many GBP news tomorrow

--- 帖子 #433 ---
the usdcad is tricky is it...

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Usdcad , short

--- 帖子 #435 ---
all my indi are very strong sell on usdcad and usdchf , but i am stuck on gbpusd T.T

Hi All, I got into this trade as well but a bit early and got stopped out. Timing wasn't right i guess.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi whitesta. Try it that way next time. A whole candle should be under the channel. You should wait for that patiently. That's not a guarantee, but it could be a better. I saw this trading idea from member Gleam, check it out, he shared some examples of his trading. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Best regards.

Thanks Micheal, Could you share the channel indicator please. Regards

Not clearly the situation on the market at this point for me, so I sit on the fence...

--- 帖子 #442 ---
btw does anyone tried this RBBM method for past few years? maybe 2010 until now? is it working since old times? if yes than this method could be use for a very long term...

--- 帖子 #443 ---
RBBM gbpusd, it still not hit SL , and the TP minimum 1.2507..... today will answer RBBM vs MPC (before or after)

I only took gbpusd since yesterday and tired for moment. btw may I ask, how long u used this RBBM method and how far u backtested / research it ? because I am still not good with this and only understand the bounce method on wednesday or maybe thursday instead.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Update

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I have been using it for past 6years-ish. This is a long term method to use, dont worry. Forex in itself is a Market which is very limited on how far it can move into one direction before it "has" to essentially bounce to "rebalance liquidity". So in short.. the FX Market is a range bound Market with pre defined limit how far it can go before it eventually goes back (who knows how far). Dont get me wrong... Trends can still last very long, but there is still a limit to it. This is why I am teaching to use the Rubberband analogy to understand the Market, now I am giving you additional context to Weekly Cycles to make a full picture of what the Market is doing.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
6 years on RBBM, amazing... thanks for the explanation

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thanks Michael. Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi Gleam. Please, I need some info. I have never worked with the ADR before, so I would like to ask you something about it. 1.) How can the ADR help you? 2.) What are your considerations when you look at the ADR? 3.) What is the period setting for your ADR? Best regards

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Exit too early. Thank you UST

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi, Michael 1. I use ADR only to visually decide where my tp will be. 2. Average Daily Range shows approximately the boundary where the price may Turn or Stop, but sometimes the price can go twice as much, probably all know that there is no indicator that exactly shown where the price will turn , at least I don't know. 3. There two Adr Indicators on My Chart. Settings on Pictures, Files: answered to your questions I hope ..

--- 帖子 #459 ---
My view on EU,GU,EA and GA. may be or may be not. After all we are competing with possibilities.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hi Gleam, mind explaining a bit more why you sold GU where you did, please? Which phase is this in the RBBM model? I am trying to see your point of view. You always kill the charts, and here I am just puzzling to understand haha! Thank you for your help!

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hi Gleam, could I get asian range indicator in the photo? thank you

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Of course

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Hi, HazHazHaz I reasearch still and try to find the best like we all in this thread. I just can explain like I understood and doing at the moment in my understanding. What we expecting on Tuesday ? As according UST theory on first page "Phase 1.5 - Setup Stretch Phase [SSP]On Tuesdays, we step into the Setup Stretch Phase, where market momentum extends in a single direction with minimal pullbacks." We can jump in but.. be very careful on Phase 1.5. I usually watching three pair eurusd, gbpusd, xauusd only on Phase 1.5. Usually after London open. You will see on chart I hope how and why I did entry today on GBPUSD. But what happening after I took profit. We see now Phase 1.5 - Setup Stretch Phase pointed to opposite side.

Thank you, Gleam, I see it better now

Gold Bounce on friday

--- 帖子 #508 ---
@UST can you comment with i see is.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
i know yesterday gold already bounce... can we sell it again ? because its really high....

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Yesterday was Thursday, and gold bounced, but today I took the extension that reached the Asian session as the beginning of the stretch phase. Then, 30 minutes before the US session, I spotted a significant RSI divergence. After analyzing everything, I concluded that there is still a chance for gold to bounce and entered a position.I personally think that the price of gold will rise. Due to the wars happening around the world, people are buying more gold. It’s hard to say if it will drop significantly soon.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
If asians Breakout begin to Phase 3 - Bounce Phase on friday . ??

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Friday have stretch and bounce phases. I was enter the end of stretch phase at US session open

I also noticed 4hr divergent

so you choosing gbpusd... I choose audusd update : hit BE... because cad news make usd strong for moment... i wonder the stretch is down today , so will buy again tomorrow.

Ahh, please help! This week's charts are all over the place for me. Anyone has any ideas or forecasts on any pairs?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Do not worry, in most pair charts are messy, it's hard to decide, maybe after the News before London open gbpchf, gbpjpy to watch or belter tomorrow...

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Haha thanks, Gleam! Glad I'm not alone to see how messy the charts are this week. Will keep a lookout for those pairs then. Also GBP pairs just shot up!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
My thought that, after London open should be like this or something ....it can be after New York open too ... pairs with gbp mostly. Do not jump to blindy....wait wait right momentum..

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I have entries. One of them..

--- 帖子 #525 ---
usdchf and eurchf anyone ?

--- 帖子 #526 ---
yes yes yes , bouncing mode done

If you are confused, there is no shame to sit out and wait till you arent confused anymore. Dont try to forecast whats going to happen, just react to what the Market is doing and trade based on that MARKET IS VERY SLOW/TRADING ON LOW VOLUME TRADE CAUTISIOUSLY AT THOSE TIMES

Yea, thanks. But for me it risky, I mean trend line crossing. Because two candles earler the same trend line was crossed, and then big move down. But yes, understandable, thanks for sharing your trades, we learn a lot from them!

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi, YES, we always at risk in Trading. If to be more accurate at "trend line crossed two candles earlier", Pay Attention WHEN IT Crossed?! IT have to cross after price crossed bottom first.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Entered on trendline(yellow line) breakout candle. It risky. Your decision would be good too I think. I just researching what better. Sometime successfully. I do not have the best entry rule still. Best entry time is after/from 9.00 our time zone(or one hour before London open), just my opinion..

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Thanks! It's risky, but with very small SL. And that's what we all want!
