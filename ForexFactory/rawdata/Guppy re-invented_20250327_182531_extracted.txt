Hi,

You have put in a lot of work!

Ron

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thank you for the System and your hard work.  Looking forward to it!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I have installed all the indicators and loaded the template.  The sub window looks different for me.  Can you please take a look.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
i read your posts
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post14889532  and https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post14891340

this can be done easily. we already have the indicator drawing vlines. but "use Daily or H4 Signal Candle on M30 or M15 Chart for better entry." i use H4 and H1 for short term trades and H1 and m15 for intraday. The charts become slightly messy but properly colour coded are easy to read. will update on this after few days. i suggest you get used to the system first.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
you are absolutely right . thanks for pointing out. i am changing the template in the first post also.

Downloaded, moved to indies

Refreshed tools | Reloaded MT4

Used your templates - everything is on it's place but no vertical lines

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Please upload your current screenshot

--- 帖子 #21 ---
the vertical lines are the most important part of the system. they are printed by the Gann indicator. they precisely point to the entry candle. no fun if no vertical lines.

make sure your chart looks exactly like mine. if not please let me know

"Do we have to exit at the bold rose vertical line?"  3 candles prior to bold rose vertical line . that candle is buullish APB, all rsiomas chhaned to opposite colour and gann vertical line opposite lime signal.

"But this is just a minor pullback, not?"  in real time it is not possible to know where the pullback will end and trend will continue .

Why don't we sell at white vertical line?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Then how do you trade with this system in real time (not on history charts)?

Sorry for my English, I mean may be you could be so kind to show some of your trades in several screenshots step-by-step to illustrate the process?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Yes, we sell at white vertical line. star inside arrow is trend envelope 51 alert . at the close of that candle you will get "trend reversal sell" alert. you confirm your entry if subwindow rsioma and gann are magenta and red rsioma is below all magenta  rsioma lines.

in this picture i was illustrating only "PBC BUY" or "PBC SELL" alerts which are generated by trend envelops 3 and 9 .

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On our charts, as long as the guppys are magenta/red it is a downtrend. any price action inside guppy lines is a pullback. in live market, as shown in the above pic, whenever the pullback is over and trend continues you will get "PBC SELL" alert {Pull Back Continuation) . that is your entry candle. whenever you get opposite (PBC BUY) alert, you should exit your short position.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
There are only 2 types of alerts: PullBackContinuation alert and Trend Reversal alert. when alerted a decision to enter the trade is to be made, rule is actually simple. all indicators should be magenta/red for sell and lime/blue for buy. preferably red rsioma should be below other magenta rsioma lines for going short and vice versa. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

red rsioma  below other magenta rsioma lines indicates strong downward momentum.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yes. the gann high low activator is not a oscillator but a chart indicator. if applied on chart with guppy lines, the chart becomes messy. for convinience and easy chart reading i have made it a subwindow indicator.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Sorry, but I'm afraid there is too much fails in the range periods (as with all the MA-crossing systems)

(or maybe I don't get something core from the filters)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
True. So higher timeframes are recommended. I prefer H4 and APB candles only.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
The question now is: What time frame is best?  Which asset / pairs to trade?  How many assets to monitor for potential setup to trade? This would be for day trading London and US sessions.

why do yo want to go long in clear downtrend?

the magenta line and PBC sell sinal after your white line is the sell candle you should trade.

Hello. thank you very much for your sharing. you have shared two templates here. which one of these should I use

--- 帖子 #55 ---
initially there was some problem with the vertical lines drawn on the chart. now that problem is solved, both templets are the same. you can use the first one as its file size is small.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
If 1 indicator fails you add 40 more, maybe one of them holds.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thank you for your time and effort, I like what I see and will be trying this on a demo account

--- 帖子 #58 ---
GUPPY was a one of my first strategy. It brings a nostalgia. I converted the docx document from first page into pdf and want to share.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
While it might seem like overkill, the Guppy MMA trading system actually uses multiple moving averages to capture different time frames and market trends. This approach helps in making more informed decisions rather than relying on a single indicator.

let me identify a few entries for you in live market, try to explain the rules better.

This is h4 chart of AUDCAD. It is in downtrend but the last APB candle shows a consolidation.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

on H1 see the pullback inside the guppies. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

now we wait for gann "trend reversal sell" alert on H1 chart, wait for the candle to close. take a short trade at the close of the candle. stoploss will be swing high on H1 chart and first target R:R 1:1. i trade with 2 lots so if my first target is acheived,i can move to H4 chart for second lot and trailing my stoploss to BE.

hope you understand.

i am working for next 8 hours so i wont be able to take this trade.

check if our charts look the same and tane a trade in demo account.

A follow up of todays recommendation about AUDCAD
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

H1 never gave a sell signal. thats good as we did not enter a wrong short trade. sometimes no trade is a good trade as you dont loose your capital.

but look at the h4 chart.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

the sub window indicators are turning lime. so the down trend in H4 is getting exhausted. that means our setup is invalidated and we will no longer be going short.

since80808
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...8#post14894498

understand that over bought and oversold zones are only for RSIOMA (which is an oscillator) and will never repaint. GANN in subwindow is not an oscillator ( i have modified it to print in sub window to prevent cluttering of main chart) and will change its position if you scroll the chart back.

also note that the H1 cahrt had given us a buy signal in the morning according to our trend reversal entry rules mentioned in guidelines document and could have generated good profit also.

the rules are :

1) TREND REVERSAL ENTRY: “Identify trend reversals at the earliest.”

Specific criteria and rules for this. All criteria need to be fulfilled to enter the trade.

These are risky trades and should be traded with strict stoploss.

1) RSIOMA AND GANN BOTH must be in overbought zone (above 80) to go short and oversold zone (below 20) to go long.

2) GANN trend reversal alert with vertical line on chart.

3) On the alert candle the RSIOMAS should cross the 80/20 line.

4) Red RSIOMA should be below Magenta for sell and blue above lime for buy trade.

5) The RSIOMA and GANN lines should form a picture like open scissors on the entry candle.

let us understand the system first. it will take time . i took more than 5 years to develop it. give me atleast a couple of weeks to explain.

Watch AUDCAD H4 chart

Downtrend is intact. (no candle closing above TE 51)

Probably TE 3 "PBC SELL" alert will be generated by the end of this candle.

But, subwindow indicators still blue/lime.

So wait for a candle to closse and Gann "TREND REVERSAL SELL" alert and magenta vertical line printed on chart.

Go short if above conditions are met.

Trade in demo account.

.

Probably it is due to time zone difference or broker server time difference. Honestly i dont know how to solve this.

otherwise your chart looks good and you can trade as per guidelines.

One suggestion : chart: properties:colour:line chart , select none so that APB candles will be clearly visible.

Dear walvekarraje,

I would like to thank you for your valuable trading idea. The indicators you put together really give very valuable signals. I have inserted the signal generators into my personal chart and it works great.

An example of:

Another method of PULLBACK CONTINUATION TRADE ENTRY: “buy on dip” and “sell on rally”.

Especially when the candles are too large, wait for opposite colour APB candle to form. Then go to lower timeframe and wait for alert in original trend direction.

same setup is developing on USDCHF H4 chart. (the pair i suffered big loss due to false breakout in the last trade )

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

one way to trade is to place a sell stop order at the low of the pullback candle as i have done. once triggered place SL and TP.

A better method is to go to H1 chart and wait for the Gann " TREND REVERSAL SELL " alert and short at the close of the candle. ( as mentioned in the gguidelines)

This is a very helpful trick that I thought of myself.

When I created my chart, I installed a placeholder in the indicator window 1, in the hope of being able to use there later something better.

I saved my charts as profiles and as templates.

I also saved your original chart as a profile.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Then I copied the part from your profile file and pasted it into the place of my profile file where the placeholder was.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Then I changed the arrow codes, that was all.

IMPORTANT

While you're doing this, some other profile must be active so that the changes can be saved properly.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Best regards

Honestly i did not completly understand the procedure rigght now. But will take a look again in my free time.

looking at your pictures, i noticed MA_Shift = 2 . it should be zero unless you have done it to compliment your charts.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
That's right, I wanted the signal line to be a little more visible. I already know that the signal is 2 candles to the left.

Save your chart as a profile, then open the profile file, it is a txt. file.

There you can find all what is on your chart and you can change everything as you wish. Then save the changes. Finally, open the newly changed profile in Metatrader and everything will be visible just as you changed it. To be on the safe side, you can save the chart as a template to carry out new experiments in the profile file.

Best regards.

Really good thread <3

Thank you very much for the strategy and open indicator codes. Thanks to this, we can learn even more. I am including an indicator that allows you to limit the vertical lines on the chart. I asked ChatGPT to add a candle limit feature in the indicator (I'm not a coder). From now on you can reduce the number of vertical lines.

Your trading signals are great, and the best thing about it is that the signals come directly to my mobile phone, so I don't have to sit at the computer all the time and wait for something to happen.

Since I only trade Gold_USD, this is easy to do.

So thank you again for your great work that you share with us.

Seriously, I've never seen a more reliable strategy.

As I already mentioned, there is no stop loss for me (but it is not a recommendation).

I only make the most reliable trades, and so far they have all been profitable, thanks to your trading strategy.

I wish you and everyone else a nice weekend.

Hi Michael, it is fantastic the way you are using the signals.  Are you taking trade setups / signals of Gold on M15?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hello Dr., hope you are enjoying your weekend.  Looking forward to your explanation of the importance of RSIOMA.

In the documents you wrote that you don't trade Forex. You trade Nifty and stocks.  What do you suggest what we should monitor as a group in this learning period, the number of assets that are offered on MT4?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Hazar.

Yes, that's how I do it. But I also take other time frames into account, such as M5, M15, H1, H4, to get a better overview.

However, I just wanted to test these signals in my own way. The result is phenomenal.

Now I would like to learn the Dr. Walvekar strategy with his original chart, because now I am convinced that it has huge potential and will lead to very good results.

______________

Best regards

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thanks Michael, I appreciate your reply.

I also think that this system has huge potential and thank you for the confirmation.

Will you be trading Gold with Dr. Walvekar original charts in the same way M5 to H4?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
..... yes I will do so. But first I need to know much more about the rules from that system, and need to understand the background. Also waiting the instructions for RISOMA.

the reason i am using 5 rsioma lines is that the make the chart visually pleasing and also to differentiate them from the gann indicator in the sub window (as they are colour coded the same)

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Yes. I am more of long term investor. I trade only equities with long term perspective. I have my own way of managing funds which I will explain some time afterwards.

As my working hours and trading hours in india are same i dont get time for intraday trades. but i love to do that whenever i have time.

On my demo charts i have 8 major currency pairs only. their only purpose is to explain trades in this group. and i am enjoying this because of your whole hearted support and interaction. i thank you for that.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
thank you Michael. this is again one of the best compliments.

Actually we are using 4 diffrent systems all of which are trading systems on their own. 1) guppy 2)synergy APB 3) Gann 4) rsioma.

i have tried to extract the best from all of them to generate high probablity trades. i have taken huge efforts to optimise the settings to pinpoint the exact entry candle and leave no doubts and uncertainty while trading.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
i usually use one time frame higher chart to make trading decisions. scrolling through all timeframes is very confusing for me.

H4 setup and H1 entry is my favourite for swing and H1 and M15 for intraday.

I think, below M15 is too noisy to take trades. but this is my opinion and i know few traders who make significant profits trading shorter timeframes.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thank you so much Dr.! Greatly appreciate you sharing your system with us. I know it is not easy developing a system that works and make and then make it in a way that requires less technical knowledge of the market for the end user to be able to trade the system.

My suggestion would be to work with H4 and H1 entry for the group for the sake of learning at this stage. Later one can venture in to whatever time frame of choosing.

Again this is only my opinion.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hello Michael!

Do I understand your process right?

You get the gann signal on the single tf (M15) and if it in the same direction with the trend on higher TFs (not signals from higher TFs, only direction) you enter the trade. Am I correct?

Do you use continuation (pullbacks) or reversal way?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Dr. Walvekar,

With all my respect to your 5 years of work on this system (parallel to your medical practice - it's something unbelievable and supernatural for me itself!), may I please ask:

How long have you forward tested this strategy when it was complete?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
just over 6 months.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi since80808

Yes, that is correct so far.  But of course I also have other guidelines.

I want to explain to you.

I have been intensively involved in Forex trading for 11 years. Over time I have developed my own trading strategy. I'm very happy with that, I don't need to do much more.

So I was snooping around the forum and noticed the Guppy re-invented thread.

I combined this strategy with mine to test it quickly, and I can tell you: If you learn it and spend a lot of time with it, you won't need to keep looking for better tools to win money.

I will also learn this strategy in detail.

My own self-developed strategy is not important here in this thread, please I don't want to talk about it.

We should all learn and understand the “Guppy re-invented strategy” with a lot of effort and respect. That means we are well on our way to confirming ourselves on the Forex market.

You probably know that trading on the stock market is a normal work, that a lot of people do.

However, you can't get rich with normal work.

Anyone who believes that will quickly become poor.

Kind regards

Thank you so much.

Hello Dr. Walvekar

I have a question.

Which of the indicators is responsible for the blue vertical lines? It's H4 chart of XAUUSD.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When testing all currency pairs I get lots of alerts, but never a vertical blue line.

Best regards

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hi Michael, from what I know of the indicators and the system, there are NO Blue Vertical Lines. Only Red and Green vertical lines which is from Gann High-Low Activator that highlights the change in direction.  Let's see if Dr. has an answer.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
..... Yes, thank you very much for the reply.

Best regards

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Blue and white verticals were my marks on charts to formulate questions to the author

--- 帖子 #128 ---
These are also generated by Gann but higher time frame. H1 on  M15 and H4 on H1.

There are 4 M15 candles in H1 chart and 4 H1 candles on H4 chart.

As Gann 9 is our alert indicator, adding Gann 36 (9*4) will give us H1 alert on M15 and H4 alerts on H1 charts . This gann 36 is printing red and blue vertical lines on the chart. This way we wont have to wait for the higher timeframe candle to close to get alert. H4 and above charts do not require MTF gann as till then the trend is very welll established. Another advantage is to trade in direction of higher timeframe and increase the probablity of profitable trade.

i will also modify the alerts so that it will be easy to understand.

i will upload the indicators and templete shortly.

This will be the last modification/upgrade in the system.

Hello Michael!

I trade over 15 years, nice to meet you

I'm at the FF with the same targets as you - just look around and get interesting ideas. Guppies were one of my first POI years ago, so I found Dr.'s thread with my best emotions

But the worst scenario I saw on FF most of the time was transforming lots of strategies into the "games with MAs", when people believed in MAs (or oscillators) crosses and then killed good practices with own bad trades)))

That's why I ask so many questions, try to understand the background of every element and forward test this very interesting for me strategy. Not to dig it

Thanks for your support

Thank you for the short description of classic Haiken Ashin candles, b.t.w. it's rare that someone write about wicks of HA, not only body

How often do you trade on one TF only as in the example? Or was it just an illustration on the history chart?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hello since80808.

Also nice to meet you.

I'm all in your opinion. Indicators are only good for the people who sell them, that's just business. One must not forget: First the currency price has to move, if the indicator notices this, it will move too.

We all continue lookimg for new possibilities, it is so anchored in our subconscious.

The Dr. Walvekar strategy is different, here the clever combination of MAs brings success. That's why I like it so much. You can immediately see that this was done intelligently.

You know, I like creating charts, I made a multifunctional chart, all indicators in this chart have an on off button, so that the chart always stays nice and clear. However, I don't use the indicators for trading, they are just decoration for me so that it looks more interesting and that you have something to switch forth and back with.

My normal trading work is finished after a maximum of 30 minutes every day. What's left is boredom, which is why I come up with ideas like creating charts.

Now I'm looking forward to learning this promising strategy in order to further improve my trading.

Kind regards

our defination is different from his. suited for our trading system.

2) Guppy multiple moving averages is a trading system developed by Daryl Guppy. well known as Guppy MMA (multiple moving averages). google it and you will find lots of documentation and videos on that.

3) RSIOMA is RSI of Moving Averages. This is a trading system based on subwindow plot of RSIOMA against a Moving average . the default value of RSIOMA is 21 and MA default value is 14. this system trades on basis of RSIOMA crossing the moving average in over bought or over sold levels. it mainly targets buy entry in over sold and sell entry in over bought zones.

4) Gann hi low activator is a part of many trading systems based on "buy low sell high" and "sell high buy low".

--- 帖子 #136 ---
1) we use only APB candles. no other indicators from the system.

2) Guppy uses Multiple moving averages. we use trend envelops.

3) we use the RSIOMA and completly ignore the MA part of the indicator.

4 Gann indicator is only to point out the exact enrty candle and final exit candle.

These modifications, settings, optimisation, alerts is what i have changed to make it a good trading system.

This is working for me with excellent results. so i wanted to share with every body in his forum.

I only trade H4 charts. Sometimes i use H1 as entry chart to trade in direction of H4.

I havementioned this in Guidelines also.

Here is an example of how i do it:
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post14895200

--- 帖子 #140 ---
The MTF version.

It is not really MTF.

I have introduced H1 and H4 histogram on M15

H4 histogram on H1.

This is for trend direction in higher timeframes.

These histograms represent Gann 9 activator of the respective timeframes.

This is mainly for traders who like to look at higher time frame charts for trade entries in lower timeframe. I do not recommend trading below M15 timeframe.

For H4 and above the trend is already well established and no need to refer to higher timeframes for trend direction.
Enter trade when all indicators are of the same color.

M15 Chart:

Thank you.

So I'm really excited now. I just scored 640 points safely after Asia opened.

I just wanted to examine again how the system works, so I installed 4 TimeFrames on a chart to get a good overview. So that was really great.

Since I am a fan of quick short orders, I naturally wanted to know how far the sell order would go. So I added lines of support and resistance. There was an important support line on the M15 chart, so I was convinced that was where the price would go.

There was the first signal on your chart, which I interpret as a warning like "get ready, stand by". Then shortly afterwards the main signal came, where I had opened the trade. I had set 5 Take Profit points even though I was convinced that the price would safely go to Take Profit 2.

That was a direct hit, 640 points (I always calculate in points, never in bips).

So this has happened for the second time in this way, on Friday and just now on Sunday evening. I'll continue this week to explore how far I can push this system. If this brings further success, I will, with your permission, call the system here at my home the Dr Rajesh Grail.

As for every trader, the most important thing is the "in" and the "out". I use the Dr R Grail to get "in" and my own Grail to get "out".

So that couldn't be topped.

So, I just wanted to share that quickly.

Thank you very much,

I will keep you all updated on further results.

Your approach of using multiple timeframes for a comprehensive overview, along with incorporating support and resistance lines, is spot on. It's great to see how you're adapting the system to fit your style of trading with quick, short orders.

I'm pleased that the signals are giving you clear entry points and that you've been able to achieve such impressive results. Please continue to share your progress and feel free to reach out. And, of course, its a honour to call it the "Dr Rajesh Grail"!

Hello Sir,

In reality, you are building your strategy.

I downloaded GUPPY-RE-INVENTED.rar from post 1. It still doesn't work properly. Not completely. despite the number of times you redid the file.

Amateurism, DIY, addition. It's a shame. Be careful not to lose too much credibility !

Advice: withdraw, build your strategy, check that the indicators and tpl in the file work when downloaded, etc. Test it because you certainly haven't been playing it for 6 months

And only then post something finished here, a finished strategy.

Sincerely

Jean-François

Dear Michael, fantastic demonstration of a beautiful setup, entry and exit.  Intraday Support / Resistance makes a different in short term trading.  Is there any specific reason why you trade Asian Open only if I may ask?

Thanks again and a BIG Thanks for Dr!

--- 帖子 #160 ---
You are quite right in placing the stop losse. Look at the  first three values in data window. they guide for placing stoplosses and trailing them. initially it is good practice to place stoploss at the 3rd value ( trend envelope 21) and as the trade moves in profit shift to upper values. when you think you are in good profit, trail it to the first value (TE 3) so you dont leave much profit on the table or straight away book profit.

In a healthy trend the high/low of our breakout candle is never breached. most of the times i place my initial SL trher.

There are no blue lines on chart. it was manualy drawn by since80808

Yes, of course.

I live in Lima, Peru. When the new trading day begins, it is 5:00 p.m. here. When London opens, it's 2:00 a.m. here, when New York opens, I take our children to school, and by the time I have time again, the most important thing with trading is already over. I have found out, that Asia Open is safer for me to trade, there is not so much bluffing. I can tell you, I take a quick look at the chart at this time, set a pending order, that's it. I only trade Gold USD.

At this time in the morning I'm chatting and creating new charts, which I really like. But no trade.

I only use the word points when trading.

This is easier for me. I also have an Excel program for quick calculations to create a quick pending order, and that is clearer in terms of points.

From now on I´m using only your original chart for my trading. My multifunctions chart is now only used for monitoring and working on the design, which I enjoy a lot.

Yes, I learned to be grateful from a young age, and because I'm so excited, I can't contain it.

Doc Rajesh,

Thank you for this great thread, your humility in sharing such a great tool selflessly by which so many will benefit.

I have worked through every page to learn and understand your system.

I have downloaded it and it works perfectly for me.

Also, thank you to the others who shared their knowledge and added value.

entry was perfect, planned.

price never came anywhere near SL.

probably any/all targets done.

most important: the charts had anticipated this move before it happened.

Hello Michael!

Do you need to look at TF H1 and H4 or do you just look at M15?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
These are orders in areas where the rsioma line is in the oversold area, so they have hit SL.

Therefore, I will never enter an order when the rsioma line is in the overbought or oversold zone, that's for sure.

Hello Dr., can you please check the code (whoever has coded for you) of the Gann High-Low Activator indicator, Vertical Lines and the Histogram Indicator.  They are running ONE CANDLE BEHIND.  You can clearly see in the Daily Chart I am posting and it is the same on all time frames.  At least this is what is on my chart when I compare with the Original Indicators. This could potentially give a delayed signal.

Dear Dr. walvekarraje,

Good evening ,

I am new here and impressed by your work, your system and strategy seems to be simple and straight forward. Actually I didn't use it yet either on demo or live. but It is very easy to understand , everything seems to be clear.

Based on my domain and love to expert advisors , do you thing we can find a formula that can get the outpout of each indicator , and make the opening / closing positions 100% automatic ? is there a factor of success ?

again thanks for sharing a nice strategy and excellent template and indicators.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
btw thank you! i like the way of how it works, simple approach. im doing more back test

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Based on your domain expertise and interest in expert advisors, it is definitely possible to develop a formula that automates the opening and closing of positions based on the output of each indicator. By carefully programming the logic and ensuring that the indicators work harmoniously, you can create a system that trades automatically.

However, achieving 100% success is challenging, as the markets are influenced by numerous unpredictable factors. While an automated system can improve efficiency and reduce emotional trading, it's essential to continuously monitor and adjust the system to adapt to changing market conditions. Success factors include robust backtesting, regular updates, and risk management strategies.

I have no experience in expert advisors. Making an expert for this system will require a step by step process starting with entry candle, then stoploss conditions etc etc.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
If you can, start creating an expert with entry on the candle where both: TE 51 alert and Gann 9 vertical line alert are there.

1) both alerts on same candle (this will be the entry candle).

2) TE 51 alert first followed by Gann 9 alert ( Gann 9 alert candle will be entry candle).

3) Gann 9 alert followed by TE 51 alert (TE 51 alert candle willbe entry candle).

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Entry price should be close price of the candle.

Hope i am clear.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Alternative is to combine 3 indicators to create one alert when all conditions are meat

1) For buy : a)  TE 51 buy alert. b) gann 9 buy alert. c) rsioma 12 below 50.

2) For sell : a) TE 51 sell alert. b) gann 9 sell alert. c) rsioma 12 above 50.

alert with push notification only on the first candle where all criteria are fullfilled.

This way we dont need to monitor all instruments, plan entry to desired price.

Any suggestions are welcome.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
This is much more viable option as a Dashboard style indicator to start with.  This way when the alert is triggered, we can see what other market dynamics are in play, such as Red News, etc., then place the trade or not.

Next phase would be development of the fully automated EA based on the finding and input of the alert indicator / dashboard.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi,

Confusion for me. Do you need all three conditions to return?

Or a + c

Or b + c

are sufficient?

Cheers

still 8 min to candle close.

and this is the situation.

1) book profit?

2) trail SL to BE.

3) set target to swing low?

4) stay in trade till opposite alert?

what do you suggest?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Everything nice and cool, my friend.

However, if there are no rules, the strategy is basically hit-or-miss.

You have no rules for TP and SL.

So, this means that sooner or later traders will start losing money, because they don't know where to exit.

You have defined the entry nicely, but then the rest is gambling.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I dont expect answer

I've made significant profits using this system, as you can see in my trade explorer. The consistent results speak for themselves. I highly encourage everyone to give this method a try. By following the guidelines and being disciplined, you can also experience similar success.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Further discussing this strategy, by the example of the above Short on EURUSD:

If we consider that the strategy requires the confluence of minimum 3 elements, I am not sure there was a valid entry:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

My magenta line shows where the histograms matched.

And in that point the oscillator definitely was at Oversold, so no valid Entry.

A better Entry would be on the Break candle, there:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

However, at that moment the histograms didn't match, and the oscillator was also near oversold levels.

So, this means that according to the rules of this strategy there was no valid Short Entry?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Ok, cool and nice, and good for you!

However, you're not telling us a miilion things about what you do and what you don't do when you trade.

So, your specific case tells us nothing, because we don't actually know if You, yourself are actually following what you write, here?

It may even be the case that You, yourself don't know.

It is almost always the case that the trader tells us a strategy which the trader sin't actually following, and their trading is descretionary.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Sir, it doesn't matter - rules are rules - independent of timeframe!

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yes!

However, I would like to concentrate on the strategy, rather than on ping-pong.

According to H4, we should be in Short:

--- 帖子 #225 ---
But also, according to H4 this was a valid Long.

And the Loss would have been significant.

This means that You aren't telling us everything.

So, is that where You put your Stop Loss?

Do you use Stop Loss at all?

When do you decide to exit a losing trade?

When do you decide to exit a winnig trade?

Do you add positions to the winning trade in order to maximize RR?

Just a few questions...

It is almost impossible to trade successfully and be profitable by signals generated from an indicator or indicators without knowing some core fundamentals about trading.  Without basic knowledge of PA and Market Structure (at the very least). signals are almost useless.  Of course this is my opinion.

I am sure Dr. know much more behind the scene than just the signal of the system.  Therefore discretion is at play.

You are totally wrong.

He has zero idea, he is just a Happy Demo Trader who has zero stress and never risked or lost real money in trading.

And he is trading unrealistic conditions.

We can get 100:1 on proffessional accounts in Europe, not 2000:1.

This means that I need to have 20 times, more or less 50K USD to get such ammounts.

And nobody is giving you a free lunch!

Plus, trading like this, one more volatile event whipes your account out!

And no Stop Loss will help, either.

You can be profitable for a long time, and lose everything in one trade.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Yes 1:2000 leverage is provided by many brokers / in many countries. What's wrong? If 1:2000 leverage illegal in Europe, so what? And you can't say 'Fraud', He clearly said he is trading on demo account, you should apologise.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
It is a scam.

I am not saying that @walvekarraje is a scammer, but that such brokers are scammers.

You are 99.9% sure to lose your money trading with a broker like that.

And if you will be making too much money, real money, this broker will make sure that you won't.

No problem on a demo account!

After all, they must encourage you to give them your real money!

That's why I claim that  @walvekarraje is not aware of what he is doing by suggesting to people that this is some marvelous strategy.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
That I know those extremely high leverage brokers are likely marketmakers. In your comment on @walvekarraje 's post it sound too hard on him. Also your previous comments involving his profession is unwanted.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
You are not entirely correct. FXTM has won best broker in some jurisdictions for many, many years years. I have used them since 2017 and they offer up to 1:2000 leverage. Funny thing is that their daily trade calls to their client rarely ever fails. Not everybody is after some small retail account. Those who would lose, would lose, even with the best broker.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
It's just the truth.

If it's not true, then there is nothing to get anxious about.

If it is true, then there is also nothing to get anxious about.

One should not cringe about the truth.

Being a surgeon requires very high discipline and following strict procedures.

Trading also requires very high discipline and following strict procedures.

If someone presents a loose strategy and tells people that it's a highly profitable strategy, but they can't provide any strict procedures, I am sorry, but it is exactly like giving someone a scalpel and telling them to learn to do surgery on their own.

As far as I remember, I was testing my work and it was correct, so I don't really know what the issue is?

Anyways, I am a very experienced trader with a lot of knowledge, that's why I am here to warn all the newbies that this isn't what the Dr claims it to be!

And, what I am writing isn't anything personal.

I am writing about the strategy and what is missing in it.

I asked the Dr, because he posted the strategy, but he can't answer my questions...

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Dr Seraj!

It is obvious this guy didn't read all the rules that you gave us.

Everyone up till now on this thread was and is in agreement that this system of yours is indeed very good and profitable.

The point in question that he makes has long since expired as an uptrend and is already in a pullback, and so far the green and magenta vertical entries are indeed very accurate as entry signals.

So don't allow some negativity to bring doubt that your system isn't good and allow yourself to be side-tracked by this Mr Know-it-all.

Rules in a strategy are a matter of choice. We all may get the same rules, but will still choose to trade in our own way; Coders work with structured methods, but traders work with rules subject to their different psychological approaches and interpretations.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
...There is no shortage of incomplete strategies on this forum. And those where the exit is not indicated are plentiful.But I recognize that the Dr's answers are vague and that the number of lots played is unthinkable.However, if we remove all the Guppies which are of no use (to air out the graph too much Christmas tree), the entries and re-entries are good. H4 possibly H1...

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Dear Dr.

you give excellent system , I will adopt it and take from it what I am satisfied with. Flexibility is a personal thing.

my first day attempt just buy following the general trend.

Assuming you didn't define TP or SL , we can choose it ourselves.

I will take this chance to thank you again.

just to be positive , what I did is , I added the template to the 28 pairs ,, and see that there is too many alerts ( we need to minimize them )

for example

when I have the last signal for a pair was SELL , if the next signal is SELL then no need to receive this singal , just the change may be alerted.

In all cases I will follow up and get what suits me , big thank for you Dr.

Regards,

Note : it is imperative that this account is demo as the system is under test

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi Omar, did you already code an EA with the 3 Conditions outlined by Dr. to have entered that many trades? Or done manually? Last we were discussing to have an Indicator / Dashboard coded to give signal to take a trade or not.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
You do realize you are coming across as a hostile participant? You are adding to the list of complaints in a crazed frenzy.

It is also the way one ask questions and giving enough room and time.

An analogy would be, you mentioned you are a very experienced trader, if one started shooting questions; prove that you are experienced, where is your trade explorer, how can we know you are telling the truth etc... curious how you would react.

Take whatever good that you can from the thread, ask in a polite manner.

Take two steps back, stop seeing problems where there are none.

Hi Hashzar,

No brother , programming need some concentration and more free time, what we discuss to be honest is long term plan. as I need to understand at least all the three indicators by opening the source code files and make sure things go smooth.

for sure , If we can get the output from the indicators , dashboarding for at least 28 pair is peace of cake after then.

I have short free times , that's why I make programs very slowly. but if I finish something I will update thru the thread here ,

Regards,

Brother that is very kind of you and would be a great service to this thread and community.  I can tell you guys that Dr's trading idea / system can be used in many different ways and it works!

It may not work for everyone as every trader gets attracted to certain style of trading based on their personality.

Thank you guys !!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
First of all, I rarely visit ForexFactory these days, as I never tried to  a friend of mine told me to have a look and I came to visit.

@BestTraderEv, if you are a very experienced trader with a lot of knowledge then you should know that strategy itself can't make a good/bad trader. Let's assume you are a good trader, then in the provided document your eye should catch the writings about the StopLoss/TakeProfit area, and even getting out of the trade. It's written in a manner that traders with good experience can catch and noobs will miss. Anyway I think you were disrespectful with few of your words.

Lastly don't feel very proud because you have knowledge and experience or you have become a high impact member here, if you can't even read a given document as professional trader then consider yourself as a beginner. You pointed about the trading conditions in Europe/brokers : You may have a lot of knowledge but let me give you some more, trading conditions of brokers are related to Risk Management , not part of a Strategy. Strategy and Risk management are two different aspects of a trader.

And, for sure, you won't be getting any coding help from me!

If anyone is interested, this is what this strategy can be stripped down to:

And nothing else is needed, just Money Management.

Just one thing: the SL lines are total BS.

If we follow any of those SL lines, we will not get the full potential of the move.

But, on the other hand, if we don't, we will lose more.

So, there is no golden rule.

We must do it discretionally.

Very interesting looking chart BestTraderEv, I am interested to know...

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Why? Because you don't have a gazzilion of  lines and colors?

This is showing exactly the same thing.

With only two of the indicators from the strategy.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
What do you want to know?

I just noned all the arrows, changed colors, and shifted the MA's 3.

And made the REVERSAL MA thicker.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So, what you have here, is the REVERSAL MA, which you should trade the Break Candle, and the theoretical SL MA.

All very simple.

The thick MA is the REVERSAL MA.

Red at the support as the Break for Short.

Green at the Resistance as the Break for Long.

Like at the top of the image, where we see a lot of false Breaks.

No need for any other stuff which actually does nothing for what will happen after we take a position.

When the trend is strong, the thick MA plays it's role.

However, we see all this in the past.

We never know if there will be a strong trend, or if the price will go sideways.

And we tend to lose the most when the price refuses to trend.

And that's why we need something to prevent us from overtrading at sideways market.

For this strategy, of course.

Like at the top of the image, where we see a lot of false Breaks.

Sorry, you just made an enemy!

Actually, the image the Dr presented looks like we used to paint our first picture of a tree in kindergarten.

A huge blob of paint on the paper which doesn't resemble anything real.

It resembles something I was doing maybe ten years ago.

My chart was so full of lines and zones, and what not, that the real candles become invisible.

And in this Guppy thing, the candles aren't even real!

You show me one proffessional trader who trades such stuff!

What do you think that all those lines, colors, and stuff actually add to your trading results?

And those are the actual lines from the strategy, not something I plotted!

So, what are you talking about?

See for yourself. Get rid of all the other indicators and just leave those two.

Dear Doctor!

The fact that I am commenting on your thread means that I care!

I am not doing a compaign against You personally.

I have no influence on the fact that stupid people don't understand anything and just react like moths to light!

I do support You and I just want to make your strategy better.

I have seen this many times!

They react like a magpie to glittering things, they love You, and after a while, when they start losing, they hate You.

And, as the above posts clearly show, they don't even know what they are using.

I literally used two indicators from the strategy in the orignal template MA settings (just shifted 3), and they say that I plotted something like a 5-year-old.

When I plotted nothing else than what's in your templates.

So, what can we expect from such people?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
What kind of psychological problem do you have? You attack the OP in a very rude way, accuse him of providing a scam to the FF community. And now you switch to " Dear Dr." and ask him to align with you against the "stupid" followers of this thread? A typical "if you can't beat him, join him pattern". Stick to your coding activities - although they are limited as the OP outlined with regards to the wrongly programmed Gann High Low Lines indicator provided by you. Please leave this thread and stop boring the community with your rude and useless comments/system optimisation proposals. Thanks!

Hi friends.

I have a hard time understanding how one can argue with other people about indicators and trading systems.

Everyone who creates a trading system has their ideas about what they want to achieve with it.

There are so many different indicators. What do they do? This is very easy to see. They chase the price because they need a guide, without the price the indicator doesn't know where to go.

For the price it´s not important, if a few MAs cross each other, or whether a line from the Stochastic crosses any level.

Anyone who has worked in Forex trading for a longer time has probably heard about support and resistance lines. These lines are created by the behavior of the traders. These lines are the magnets that keep attracting the price. Actually, you don't need any other indicators because the price finds its way to these lines, or rather levels, all by itself.

If you don't believe that, you can install a tool like this on the chart and watch how the price goes to these levels in all time frames.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I haven't been able to figure out why that is, but I have an idea. It would be possible that these levels are take profit levels from the Big Player, and that is why the prices are consistently guided towards these lines.

Why does the price turn around when it reaches such a level? As some big players have reached their take profit and are cashing in, this leads to a price reversal.

If you look at the charts carefully, you can easily guess where Forex traders will move the price.

I also have a few small arrows on my charts, but I don't necessarily need them, they're there because it looks nice and has a small psychological effect. So, as I said, these levels don't come about because a few indicators cross each other, but they are there and came about because money was invested there with the aim of getting to another resistance or support level.

I make my trades very carefully, and when I make one, then I get a hit.

This is where the Guppy trading system comes into play. This can make trading decisions much easier and I'm glad that it exists, thank you Doc.

If you would like to have some take profit levels, simply add a slightly modified Fibonacci (member Gleam showed me that) and you will definitely not be disappointed.

Every trader can try that. It helps with earning money. So, there is no reason for unnecessary arguments.

I'm not introducing a new trading idea. I'm just showing that it's not worth making such a big fuss about a lovingly developed trading strategy.

Best regards to everybody.

Respected BestTraderEv,

I will try  to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge.

To start with in my original first post, all the documents were under the heading of Guidelines. I never said rules of trading... Rules are strict, Guidelines are “something that can be used to help you make a decision or form an opinion.”.

You said “However, if there are no rules, the strategy is basically hit-or-miss.

You have no rules for TP and SL.”

The 5th sentence in my first document is “Trend envelops from 3 to 51. Special attention is to 3,9,21and 51.red blue lines with circle dot or star. (the values are seen in data window in the same order).

3 and 9 are to identify pullback continuation pattern
21 is for stoploss

51 is for reversals.

“You have defined the entry nicely, but then the rest is gambling.”

Well, trading is not gambling. It is taking calculated risks.

Page 10) or the end of the document:

So, the trade should be squared off at

A)      trend envelope “PBC SELL” alert

B)      trail SL at trend envelope 21. (third value in data window)

C)      APB bearish candle/Gann “trend reversed sell” alert.

I square off irrespective of profit/loss if

1)      Opposite colour bullish or bearish APB candle.

2)      All rsioma change to opposite colour.

The answers to your questions are already documented.

You said “However, you're not telling us a miilion things about what you do and what you don't do when you trade.

So, your specific case tells us nothing, because we don't actually know if You, yourself are actually following what you write, here?

It may even be the case that You, yourself don't know.

It is almost always the case that the trader tells us a strategy which the trader isn’t actually following, and their trading is discretionary.” “Your strategy is missing all the most important elements”

In the documents about RSIOMA and APB candles, I have clearly written with pictures illustrating how to interpret them on our charts. (Which is nothing close to the way they are traditionally used.)

None of the indicators I have used the default settings, but I have optimized them to synchronize with our charts and define clear entry candle.

You said

“What kind of leverage do you need to have in order to enter 4 lots with 2456.86 USD and still have 1612.52% Margin Level???
Where do you get such trading conditions???”

Here you are right. I have no experience in in trading forex market. I trade in Indian markets. We don’t have mini or micro lots. In the document. “My method of trading: I enter with 2 lots. My initial stoploss is previous swing high/low. As the trade progresses, I shift SL to trend envelope 21 (third value in data window). I square off one lot with R:R 1:1 . second lot I carry till I get a opposite signal.”

Same principle I used in trading demo account. I had no idea that this will amount to trading unrealistic conditions or huge fraud or scam. Here please ignore my ignorance.

Finally, I am addressing you Respected because I mean it. I have been reading your posts in the other thread without missing a single one. Your skills as a coder are exceptional and you use them to help others is very creditable. Your work on “RSIOMA_v4.0_alerts_collab” was at my request and I cant imagine the amount of hard work and the number of hours you put into it. Unfortunately, it did not work with my charts as expected, still I am grateful for that.

I have already said this twice and I will say it again.

Happy to see you here.

‘

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Ryder!

I trade on the 4H and regularly look down to the H1 to see what's going on.

For pullbacks I go down to the 15M as confirmation that the colors are aligned the same in the opposite direction if I want to trade the counter trend/pullback and if not then I wait for the main trend colors to come in alignment on the 15m with the 4H to continue then join the continuation again on the 4H.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Ryder.

I didn't make any of these trades. I only used these two images to show how important resistance and support lines are.

I like trading on the M15 timeframe.

The 1st picture is H1, the 2nd H4, so that you can see the resistance and support better.

Since Dr. Rajesh published his system, I use his signals for entry, and the support and resistance levels in combination with the modified Fibonacci for take profit.

Maybe this information will help you.

Kind regards

About yout trading results:

That's not bad, apart from the two open orders.

I find it a bit difficult to make both open orders, buy and sell positions, profitable because with 10 cents, then with gold USD, and such a bit money in the account. That can quickly become a nightmare.

In addition, the buy order also brings daily negative swap costs.

If you try to have the support and resistance lines in the background on the chart to orient yourself, I am convinced that you will have even better performance.

I think this should be the basis of every chart, but it's a matter of opinion.

I really like Dr Rajesh's trading system, I've written about it a few times. What I like best are the entry signals.

I deleted all the other things, now there are only 2 trading systems that I work with, that's his and mine.

Ok, I don't want to bore you with so many things. You know now, what you could do.

Identifying false breakout (also read the document on the same).

This is H4 chart of GBPUSD.

As described in the document and the pic, we identify the false breakout on H4 chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

To get a earlier entry, go to H1. The candle which satisfies all our criteria is our entry candle.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

After entry go back to H4 to monitor your trade. Now as long the red rsioma is below Magenta and APB candles are bearish it is safe to remain in trade.

And trail SL at TE 21.

Everything as per guidelines.

This is how all indicators work in tandem.

Hi,

I don't speak English, I use a translator. And I have a little over 15 years of experience in Forex. I am a very very old man.

I simplified a lot. Only kept what is useful to the strategy. Kept only for example, the Ma 3; 6; 9; 51 for visual signals, SL evolution and trend. And we could still simplify that too.

The graph is more airy, more readable, more visual. Less “Christmas tree” overloaded.

Rajesh Reversal is in fact an old indicator (reviewed, redone by "jeanlouie", then by the Dr who renamed it) and I am surprised that in all this time no one has noticed the excellence of the signals... excellence if it doesn't repaint? As well as Rajesh GLH Histo (old indy renamed)?

I also fired APB because I like to see what the prices are really doing. Which does not modify the signals at all.

Added the very important "Support and Resistance" (with a button on the side).

There you go, I'm not quite finished and of course I won't post here so as not to bother this thread

This is just to show you what can be done simply and effectively with the same indicators.

Santé

Hello le celte, thanks for posting.  I like your chart and your understanding.  Yes when the indicators are understood and what they do (break of EMA chanel) then you can modify your chart to suit one's style.  Mine is something similar to Michael's where I have converted Doctor's signal in to wiggly and arrows. And support / resistance indicator on my chart.  Trade in the direction of the trend (sub-windows) when signal is given.

But it is best to stick to Doctor's original template for those that are new.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Sir,

1) It is also possible to remove all lines and arrows and keep only the alerts working. This way it will be like trading naked charts.

Also it is possible to use only alerts in your own charts as Michael is doing successfully. As i have already said if you can read between the lines, you need only alerts. I have made charts user friendly so that just by looking at the last candle, a trading decision can be made. No analysis required.

2) I assure you sir, none of the indicators repaint.

I have modified the indicators, especially the alerts to make it easy to identify which indicator has produced alert, at what time frame and what is the significance of that alert.( even the alert is seen on mobile phone). I have renamed the indicators for convinience and do not take any credit for them.

3) Every line on the chart has its own significance while making trading decisions. To understand this please translate and read the documentation in the first post. Then you will understand why the chart needs to remain the same.

Happy Trading

Everyone is making an effort to simplify and make the charts more readable. ( I fail to understand why?) Everyone is free to use the indicators and alerts and add them to their own trading systems and trading styles. However, to maintain consistency and ensure everyone can follow along easily, I kindly request that we stick to the original template and settings. This way, we can all discuss and learn from the same setup, ensuring clarity and uniformity in our analysis. I hope you understand and continue to find value in the system as it is.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
The charts and all indicators together form a comprehensive trading system that is both easy to analyze and visually appealing. Apart from good entry signals there is much more to learn and understand. Entry if you have missed the initial entry, re-entry, adding to positions, extracting maximum profit in a healthy trend etc etc. Finding support and  resistance is good but we have see these levels broken all the time in a stong trend. we have seen so many times that after your tatgets are reached, the trend contiues much further, otherwise how new highs and lows will be formed?

A request again to stick to the templete.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I completely agree with you Dr.!  We all can easily post modified charts as we have done already.  But that will diminish the actual learning and exploring of the system as is on which you have spent a lot of time fine tuning.  It has only been a little over a week and we are busy doing our best to change the original system.

Now if anyone can create a Scanner Alert for Multiple Pairs to be monitored and alert us to a potential trade, that would be amazing!  Any coders want to take this challenge?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I agree with you Doc. and also with you Hashzar that we should not deviate from the purpose of the whole thread by watering it down with charts other than

the charts of Dr Rajesh.

IF you do make changes for your own purposes then it's good if you keep it to yourself besides explaining here on the thread what changes you have made and how it affects or enhances the outcomes of the original system.

This is a fantastic system that (I believe) can benefit us all if we brainstorm our experiences and also to share pitfalls and difficulties we encounter on the way forward.

I trust that my observations will not annoy anyone here.

Maybe if someone could share how to create a window within a window to monitor a smaller timeframe like the 15M (small window) on a 4H to be able to see a pullback while trading the 4H.

How do you explain why markets should follow your pattern, where predicting power comes from.

Hi PMT, H4 is clearly in a Downtrend. Best is to wait for a pullback and re-enter short in the direction of H4 trend if the setup presents itself. Going long here would be too risky in my opinion.

Also, wait for H4 candle to close before making an entry decision. Because price can drop before candle close and signal is not valid anymore.

For a "False breakdown" least one candle should close below the TE 51 line and print arrow ( star in circle).

in your image there is no "False Breakdown" as the uptrend is intact. The entry at the close of your last candle and there are no red/magenta lines above the candle then this  is justified as a continuation trade.

" False breakout" is in Down trend and "False breakdown" is in Up trend.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Doc!

IF members read and re-read your notes and the guides that you supplied then there will be a better understanding of this great system.

If you read and don't understand then come here and ask the points that are unclear...like the answer that Hashzar explained in this last post; it is precise and very clear.

What we must understand about this system is that it is not a scalping system where you will scalp on the 15M or 5M...It is a system that you trade on the 4H like the good Doctor said and then check your pullbacks on either the 15M or 1H.

In H4 on candle (1,2) a reversal trade is valid as per our rules. Page 8 of 'GUPPY RE-INVENTED" document. in this document i have missed a very important criteria in "1) TREND REVERSAL ENTRY: “Identify trend reversals at the earliest.”

The criteria is " Ignore the Guppy if ALL other criteria are fullfilled".

I dont know if the H1 was at the same time as H4 chart. still your long entry is valid but not on candle 4 but candle 3.

M15 trades are scalping trades. Here it is Quick In,Quick Out. R:R 1:1,1:1.5, 1:2 is the max you should target at.

one more observation: Your chart is not a full page chart but

same chart posted by Hashzar https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post14909996 is a full page chart. And his analysis is perfect.

in his chart, there is no "scissor" formation in subwindow. Then as i said earlier, trend reversal entry is NOT justified.

For all: To have a honest opinion or analysis describe in full charts. This way we will be on the same page.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Sir,  The trading system I've shared is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, making it easier for traders to understand and follow. The predictive power comes from the consistent application of well-established indicators and patterns that reflect market behavior. While the system might seem complex initially, it is actually based on fundamental market principles that many traders already use. By learning and applying these principles, we can create a self-reinforcing loop that enhances predictability. I appreciate your perspective and encourage you to explore the system further to see how it can work for you.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Absolutely right. One step further.... Trade in demo account till you get hang of the system.

"What we must understand about this system is that it is not a scalping system where you will scalp on the 15M or 5M."

This can be very well used for scalping also. But the criteria, guidelines for that are different.

As the thread progresses i will try to explain that also in short documents.

Hope & Glory,

I shall use an example of a 4H Gold trade that I am currently in; The trend on Gold is Bearish right now, so when you see a color change in the candles moving slightly sideways or in opposite direction it is good to go check the lower timeframes eg 1H,30M,15M to see if a pullback has started, unless you receive an alert thereon.

I normally bank if in profit or close down if the loss is affordable, but one can also hedge your trade and trade the counter-trend buy to add some profit from the counter-trend/pullback and then close off the trade if the price turns in the direction of the 4H major trend.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Markets don't need to "follow" any pattern – the system is based on principles that have consistently worked for those who take the time to understand and apply them.

For eg. Dogi, Hammer, Head and Shoulders, etc etc etc. Do you think that these accepted patterns work 100% of times? Still trades are taken on these patterns.

Sometimes they work, sometimes they dont.

what we are trying to do is to find high probablity, low risk high reward entries.

And this system is working for me.

When the candle closes and signal is in tacked.  Buy AUDUSD.

1.  TE 51 = Buy

2.  RSIOMA below 50 and changing color

3.  Gann 9 Green

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Perfect. only TE 51 is already a buy at last but 2 candles. the alert is PBC buy alert by RE 3 and Gann 9 Trend Change alert

And why not take the second trade?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hint : Only one indicator which does not allow the buy trade .

--- 帖子 #363 ---
RSIOMA Overbought and turning Red.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Yessss  10/10

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Doc,

The first one is a definite continuation buy trade to join up with the main 4H bullish direction.

The second is a no-go as there is consolidation, mixed candles and no alerts to take a trade.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thank you Doctor!

Because we have different brokers, then funny thing is that we have different looking AUDUSD chart... lol

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Every alert is not a tradable alert. All indicators should agree. This is how high probablity entry is possible.

this is the reason its very difficult to compile an expert. too many parameters to consider.

this is a manual trading system .

There is one secret indicator, which is free and everybody has it. only it is neglected.

Your brain. The eyes can see what the brain knows.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
You call it trend continuation? No problem (even not looking at the break of the structure and not a trend for that moment, ok). But price went down (with all the indicators tandem lime). It's absolutely the same price-MAs-crossing games with oversold\overbought oscillators that just confirm each other at every momentum\stop hunting\range. In any trend you don't need indies, and no indies will show you the end of the trend.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
It's not about quicknes. Do we use SL? Yes. Will the trade be stopped using MAs (with any names) in range? Absolutely - look at any one of my screens in this thread.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
So (as BestTrader Ev wrote)  - we only have an idea of entries (based on MAs = nothing in a range or at the momentum) and not a strategy with the somehow calculated or market structure based targets.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I will not buy USDCHF because the candle has not closed through the small flag.

walvekarraje please correct me.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
the only reason not to take a buy trade is "RSIOMA Overbought" zone . as answered correctly by hashzar. Very likely that in overbought zone it will have a pullback which will take out your SL. risk is too high to take the buy trade. this is the significance of RSIOMA on our charts.

the system will and should work irrespective of the broker. I HOPE.

Hi, for those who scalp with this system, attached is an indicator with the ability to set the number of candles on the chart (this has already been done), and with the ability to set the number of vertical lines visible on the chart.

Can you modify the indicator to draw Horizontal Line at the High and Low of the reversal candle?  Lines to be Red on down reversal and Green on up reversal.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Conversations with ChatemGPT can be difficult and long, despite the simplest requirements for modifying the indicator. I will check to what extent I can come to an agreement with ChatemGPT regarding horizontal lines. For a seasoned coder, it's probably a few lines of code. I'm green in coding. Only what I order for ChatGPT. When the effect is positive, I will come back here with an indicator. If the effect is negative, I will remain silent

Hi,

Is it possible that you did not go through the initial guideline provided?

There he explained his exit strategy: TP1 on 1:1 RR, then move remaining position to break even and trail with TE 21.

keep in mind there will be losing trades in every strategy or system.

To minimise risks and losses, he advises not to take a trade if the entry candle is too large and requres a huge SL.

I do not know either of you, and have only tried to perhaps provide some insights that you may have missed.

Cheers!

Hi walvekarraje,

Thank you very much for this system of trading, I will test it on demo account.

Which time frame do you recommand to test it?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Thank you for your kind words !

Its good that you are following H4 .

Lets try to analyse your GBPAUD H1 chart.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The breakdown candle is huge. no one will trade on that candle.The following 3 APB candles were bearish but none went below the break down candle.

The following 4 APB candles were lime body but no lime wick. These are consolidation candles as per our guidelines. The next APB candle is magenta body and wick ( bearish as per our guidelines) . also the RSIOMA which had turned blue, turned red again.( Red RSIOMA below magenta). that was your entry candle to enter short with SL at the consolidation swing high. Rest, number of lots, lot size, targets, money management as per your rules. This was a definate profitable trade .

--- 帖子 #419 ---
H4.

H4 because the trend is already established. There is less noise in price action. also you get adequate time to plan entry and money management.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Please do test in demo account first. Get used to the system. Understand all the indicators and their role. though it might seem complicated at first, its a visual system. just by looking at the colour of all indicators, the entry will be clear.

Honestly i dont trade forex. i am a swing / positional investor in indian market and equity.

BestTraderEv has already pointed out that the margin i am enjoying in demo account is unreasonable.

someone has already said that trading in demo accout is not the same as trading in real account.

I agree with both of them.

I know the system works for me. Hope it will work for you too.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Thank you for analyzing this case, I have learned another lesson.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
PULLBACK CONTINUATION TRADE ENTRY: “buy on dip” and “sell on rally”.

This is a good example how to define “sell on rally”. To identify where the rally has ended and the down trend i intact, that also on a specific candle. No exra analysis required. also SL is defined. what remains is money management, targets and trailing SL when in profit.

Regarding your issue with uploading charts on Forex Factory, there might be some technical steps or restrictions you need to follow. If anyone in the group can assist with this, it would be greatly appreciated.

This is a combination of 4 trend trading systems optimised to work as one.

There are setups within setups in the whole system.

Adding and removing stuff might help your own trading strategy but might not be useful for others.

Let me give you an example.

Only using guppy trend envelops, there is a very profitable setup which i do like to trade. It is trading the first pullback.

Hi ozkanim

It might help if you know where are the resistance and support levels in the M15, H1 and H4 chart. Then you know where it can become dangerous, or you can decide whether it would be better to close the trade.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here you can see that the entry point was very good. M15 and H1 are zoomed in a lot, for a better overview. The vertical yellow lines show the entry in the 3 time frames. I sometimes use this chart as a scanner. The yellow circles at the bottom provide even more security for a successful trade. Top set up.

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #448 ---
hello @walvekarraje so in this case how would you have manged this trade had you gone in on the second green candle in H4 as false breakout is forming later ?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Wait for candle to close.  This is a mistake I do when i am working and expecting the market to move in my anticipated direction.
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14923864

This is the same mistake I did twice  in my last USDCAD trade. My sell entries were triggered on open candle and then the price reversed.

Obviously my SL were hit.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I consider the Guppies while entering a trade. They represent dynamic area of support and resistance.

https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14921425

Notice my entry candle of GBPUSD. A single candle broke all the resistances upto TE 51 in a downtrend. Obvious trend reversal.

While trading H4, For entry I will consider support resistance on H4 and above. Those on M15 and H1 are significant for target levels I suppose.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
A long entry on the open of second green candle was a valid reversal entry as per our guidelines.

My initial SL is always the swing high/low in trend reversal entries and first  target R:R 1:1 ( I trade 2 lots). As the trade progresses i trail Sl to TE values in the data window. In this case I would trail SL on TE 9 which i usually follow (second value in data window). TE 3 is too close at the beginning of the trade but when in significant profit I trail it to TE 3 (first value in data window.

As the trase progresses and as long as the APB candle color is in your favour, it is a good practice to keep SL deep so you dont get taken out by the volatility.

Hope ths helps.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I have to get used to see the guppies as support and resistance. I can always learn something new in this way.

I think that's good.

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Take al look at your profile.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
A classic example is in the same post.
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14921425

Look at the EURUSD chart.

After Uptrend is established ( all guppies green) The first pullback early in the trend is inside the guppies which act as dynamic support and continuation pattern confirmed by TE 3 buy alert. If you miss it then the Gann alert on the next candle. Also notice the flag made by the red guppies which is broken (dynamic resistance).

Such entries are very common and extremly profitable.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Just by looking at the charts you will realise the beauty and ease of trading.

I have put in lot of efforts to optimise the settings.

Read my posts above with lot of explaination of how to use and utilise them for entries.

Thank you for your contribution dear tolani to doctor's wonderful trading system.

Hello doctor, thank you for your kind words, I haven't done anything extra ordinary, I only use my  years of experience to my advantage.

Here is a gift for you.

Chart for scalping in M1 and M5 time frame.

For scalping, so many indicators and alerts are not required. RSIOMA is also unnecessary.

Alerts required are TE 51 in current time frame and change of trend in higher time frame.

There are 2 histograms in the template which represent :

In M1 : M5 and M15 histogram with alert on M15 color change

In M5 : M15 and M30 histogram with alert on M30 color change.

The idea is to trade in the direction of higher time frame histogram.

Trailing SL on TE 51 price in data window or as per your choice.

Tahe profit as per your choice.

Hello doctor.

The indicators from this website only work on the same computer that downloaded them. These indicators cannot be sent and then installed.

But your system is very good, you can't improve it, a grail is a grail, there's nothing what would be better.   Since June 10th until July 12th I have made 21 hits thanks to your system, and I have already written that I never set a stop loss. (I already know it's against the rule).

Looking for something better is a waste of time.

Best regards

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hello Doctor.

I saw the indicator that you put here for download. I haven't tested it either. I am very happy with the signals from your system, other signals or other indicators are not necessary.

This chart that I sent, is actually only intended for people who have little time and can't sit at the computer for long time, to wait for something to happen. I only trade Gold and use a 3 time frame scanner only for Gold.

Kind regards

Dear Doctor,

I have a special request to make.

I would be very pleased if you and or some of the other friends on the thread would be willing to work with me on this GBPUSD trade that I have entered as a Sell trade.

I enclose a picture of my 4H platform.

Just your input on how you see the trade develop and what you think will do.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Dear Worsman, GBPUSD is in an uptrend and hitting some resistance on H4 and currently doing a pullback. I don't think it is a good setup for short.  You should look at other pairs and for better setup making sure that All Colors of indicator are same color in the direction of your trade.

Great system! It's one of the best on Forex Factory that I've seen yet. Shoutout to Jeanlouie, Rajesh, TrendLaboratory, and Walvekarraje for their contributions!

I noticed that the RTE25, Rajesh PBC, Rajesh Reversal, and Rajesh Intermediate Trend were all the same indicator but with slightly different colors, line widths, and MA periods.

I created a version that combines all four indicators into one and developed an MT5 version. I removed the alerts, as this indicator works best with visual cues, and I plan on creating an EA that utilizes the indicator after integrating the Histogram.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Dear Hashzar,

Thank you for your input...much appreciated.

I am already in this Sell trade because of the strong uptrend that this pair was in, but I believe that the GBPUSD has peaked already at 1.29950 and is presently hovering around 1.29555.

It just pierced a bearish FVG from below to retest that FVG zone at around 1.29575 which I believe it will bounce off further downward towards 1.28000.

I might be wrong if the market turns towards 1.30000 upwards again, but I shall be vigilant on this one.

Any other input is welcome.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Becareful your setup doesn't follow rules of this trading strategy because all indicators should be Line/Blue for buy and Red Magenta for sell. Preferred buy entry when RSIOMA is below 50 and vice versa.

In the GUPPY RE-INVENTED document :

TREND REVERSAL ENTRY: “Identify trend reversals at the earliest.”

Specific criteria and rules for this. All criteria need to be fulfilled to enter the trade.

These are risky trades and should be traded with strict stoploss.

1)       RSIOMA AND GANN BOTH must be in overbought zone (above 80) to go short and oversold zone (below 20) to go long.

2)      GANN trend reversal alert with vertical line on chart.

3)      On the alert candle the RSIOMAS should cross the 80/20 line.

4)      Red RSIOMA should be below Magenta for sell and blue above lime for buy trade.

5)      The RSIOMA and GANN lines should form a picture like open scissors on the entry candle.

In your case the 5th criteria is not fullfilled.

Any way reversal trades though risky, they have minimum risk and very high reward if they work in your favour.

Lastly a rule i follow strictly is to exit the trade if opposite color APB candle is formed (body and wick both opposite color) exit the trade irrespective of profit or loss.

--- 帖子 #563 ---

If you want to trade on M15 (and M5 or M1), it is recommande to follow the trend in higher timeframes (H1, H4, Daily, etc...). All this higher timeframes trend must be in the same direction. Open only buy signal in M15 if all timeframes (H1, H4, Daily, etc...) are up and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
All your entries are technically. Rest is money management.

It is more important to understand the logic behind false breakout.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
yes i check the histogram for 4h and 1h before entering and a quick check to htf

--- 帖子 #578 ---
yes this is only backtesting , is my logic in entering trade correct or something wrong? 4trade in EU 3w 1 loss

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Let me try to explain the logic behind entry after a false breakout. let us analyse the trade i am in now.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

After a nice uptrend, there is a breakdown (price trading below TE 51 according to our criteria).

When price reached support area (aqua horizontal line), the buyers tried to push it up 3 times. The price went above the TE 51 for brief moment but fell again. The sellers were absorbing all these buyers and not letting the price to go up.( area between two blue vertical lines)

The price finally broke the support when fresh and strong sellers entered the market. That is our entry candle with TE 3 sell alert + Gann 9 sell alert.( this is the beauty of our system : identiy the exact candle )

When this support is broken all the stoplosses of the trapped buyers will get triggered pushing the price further down with momentum and without any fresh sellers.

This is exactly what happened in the subsequent candles.

These are high probablity trades with low risk high reward.

Notice that my R:R here is almost 1:3 and the TP is about to hit.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
My target was hit as i was writing the above post. Now i will trail my second lot at my will .

cheers

--- 帖子 #581 ---
you enter your trade below the 50 level is this okay it should be supposed to enter short rsioma must above 50 level?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Though i dont trade shorter timeframes, two timeframes higher than your entry chart need to be considered. For M5, M15 and M30 should be sufficient to enter in their direction. Trading daily and M5 entry is too far fetched. That is the reason why there are histograms representing M5 and M15 on M1 chart and M15 and M30 on M5 charts.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
around 50 is ideal. But should not be below 20 or above 80.

Hi Walvekarraje,

Thank you so much for sharing such a great trading system. It's incredibly generous of you to share for free what looks like a successful system

I am still learning this strategy and started using it on a small live account. I started trading your system on 10th July and I share a screenshot of my results so far.

I need to learn to be patient and ride the profitable moves and not close out too early.

Thanks again and God Bless you.

Thank you Doctor for this wonderful system, I was actually waiting  for sell audusd possibly it may happen 2 am tonight. I'm Watching

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Let me take this opportunity to explain the diffrence between flag trades and failed breakout trades. The same chart of USDCHF i profited today.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Notice the flag long entries in the uptrend. Valid and profitable trades obviously. Notice the APB candles after the flag. They are small but bullish.

The reason is, there should be a strong buyer to move the price up and pumping money in. The stoploss orders of sellers can take the price up but not forever.

In the failed breakout, the amount/number of trapped buyers is huge. once the support is broken, the SL orders will push the price down irrespective of any strong sellers. The momentum of SL orders will push the price down in  long bearish move.

The system is based on sound logic and understanding of price action and still fine tuned for a newbee to trade without understanding the logic behind it.

Hope you understand.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Risky. RSIOMA are in oversold zone.

--- 帖子 #600 ---

please can you share more of your entries? and how do you risk manage, sl and tp, same as Doc rules?

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hi E.G,

I believe the Doctor recommended that the lowest time frame for this system is 15mins. Please be aware that any time frame below the recommendation increases the Risks quite considerably.

Are you using a higher timeframe to decide the direction of the markets so you are not trading against the trend.

Please note, I'm still learning this system myself. My observation is that it's really important to trade with the overall market trend.

Others will probably have more to add.

My advice is not to enter a trade when the candle is so far away from 51, and even less so if the candle is large.

Hi Kraneos, thanks for template, i was using the one that PipsArt shared, now i will try yours.

Yesterday i was down 70 pips on 1 min gold and today i am up 70 pips, so maybe i am getting better with system or market is trending today and thats the reason, i still take 10 pips profit, i dont understand how to hold longer and where to close position, can you share how do you manage your scalp trades please?

I don't follow any strict rules, I look at price action and indicators as you can see in my charts above, so I advise you to follow the Doctor's rules for management, with the lot size you consider, explained in post 589.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Kraneos is right.
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14937355

I would like add to this

In CHFJPY, a) there was no follow through downwards. In H4 chart next 5/6 candles are inside candles. The red RSIOMA never crossed the magenta anytime. This                         indicates poor trend and no momentum.

b) there is a fully formed opposite APB candle, square off the trade irrespective of profit/loss. At least shift SL to high of that candle.

c) opposite Gann 9 signal and all RSIOMA blue lime...... no reason to remain in the trade.

This way minimise losses.

In GBPCHF, the RSIOMA are already in oversold zone. this becomes a high risk low reward entry.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
No stop loss and take profit?

Thank you Doctor for these comments and advice

Now trailing SL at TE 3 deep target

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Yes, but I follow the rule with visual sl and tp, because in M1 I need to act fast.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
In short.

Guppy will define the trend

Gann 9 will point out exact entry candle

APB candles will define trend strength

RSIOMA will define momentum and also overbought and oversold zones where not to enter trade.

" Yeh to trailor hai. Picture abhi baki hai"

The Hindi phrase "Picture Abhi Baaki Hai Mere Dost" translates to "The story/film is not over yet, my friend." This is an idiomatic expression that suggests there is more to come, or that the situation is not yet complete. It implies that the journey or story is ongoing and there are still unresolved elements that are yet to play out.

The phrase is often used metaphorically to convey that a particular situation or circumstance is not yet finished, and there are more developments or events waiting to unfold. It encourages the listener to be patient and have an open mind, as the full picture or outcome has not yet been revealed.

Yes, I posted it here. They do not have alarms, and I don't intend to add them since the next step is to create an expert advisor that trades the system. I'm new to this system as well, so it will take several more hours of observation and manual trading success before a successful expert advisor is created.

Many many thanks for your involvement, time and efforts.

For expert, the entry condition is all indicators should be lime/magenta and rsioma lines around 50 level.

Is it possible to  create a alert first  when all are lime/magenta in main chart, subwindow and to include/exclude 2 histograms (where histogram settings can be changed according to the timeframe of main chart).

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Thanks for the clarification I'll take some time this week and look into it. Your examples of successful trades are really helpful.

I'll create a Guppy-SuperTrend that utilizes all of the indicators and has an alert system. We can use that in the expert advisor as well.

A few questions if you don't mind.When you say all indicators should be lime/magenta, does that include the Gann lines? Is there an exit, take profit, and stop loss strategy? Kraneos mentioned not taking the trade if it is far away from the 51 EMA. What are your thoughts?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
A Guppy-SuperTrend indicator will be a great help personally for me as my broker does not support MT4.

"Kraneos mentioned not taking the trade if it is far away from the 51 EMA. What are your thoughts?"

This is very relative term. Depends what zoom level is the chart. Also in live market the price may appear far away but when next few candles ar printed it may not.

"When you say all indicators should be lime/magenta, does that include the Gann lines?"

Yes. The vertical Gann 9 lines are our specific entry candle when all other criteria are fullfilled.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

We dont trade all Gann 9 signals.

1) Either the TE 51 star and gann 9 verticle line should be on the same candle or

2) The Gann 9 vertical line should be printed after the TE 51 star.

These are trend continuation signals and our trading signals.

When Gann 9 line appears before the TE 51 star.... this is Trend reversal pattern and right now we are not trading this pattern as it is slightly more complicated.

"Is there an exit, take profit, and stop loss strategy?"

Yes. I trade with 2 lots. Initial SL for both lots is swing high/low. For expert TE 51 can also be used as initial stoploss.

My TP for first lot is R:R 1:1

If an opposite APB candle is printed, before TP 1 I close my position irrespective of of profit/loss.

After TP 1 is acheived, I trail my SL on TE 21 or 9 or 3 depending on the strength and momentum of the trend.

Hope this helps.

Then it may be as Kraneos wrote that you have too many indicators in the indicator folder. Make a backup copy of the indicator folder, and then delete any indicators that you don't need for Doctor's trading system. If nothing works, reinstall the Mt4 and only copy these indicators into the indicator folder and these templates into the template folder, that must work.

Hello friend.

I just put some quick examples, I didn't look at all of them either.

In this case that you indicate, you can follow the doctor's instructions, opening two operations at No. 2 and closing the first one at the pink candle and you can let the other one go, while the H4 histo is still in the buy mode.

In case it is the first entry where you indicate, it seems correct to me but with caution because I see the Rsioma very high already.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Excellent, thanks for the explanation my friend.

Is it my mistake?, does it not work for M1?, does it still need to be adjusted?

Hi rehmatkhan00

That file "Guppy Reinvented MTF.tpl" is the template, it´s not an indicator, that have to be in the template folder.

After you have place "Guppy Reinvented MTF.tpl" in the template folder, restart the mt4, then you are able to open that template in your mt4, and you will see that all 12 indicators are working well.

Please upload a foto of your Indicator folder and also of your template folder, that we can check, if you have done that right.

I really have no idea if this system can be backtested with so many indicators and parameters. Though Gann 9 points the entry candle, our entries are not on every alert...  i will suggest a manual backtest where all conditions are satisfied.

Second and better option is to view my trading journal and the trade list. It will be a backtest as well as a forward test as the journal will not lie.

H4 is optimal for me and my trading because of my work. But this tool can be used in any timeframe, with a proper risk and money management.

On H4 wait for PBC buy alert and Gann 9 alert to enter long .

I made a backtest with my EA for 2024 on EURUSD H4. For the moment, this EA is still under development.

Please find below results.

My setup with my EA is:

1) All trend envelopes must be the same color: Lime for a BUY and Magenta for a SELL.

2) Gann vertical dotted line must be Lime for a BUY and Magenta for a SELL.

3) RSIOMA must be Lime for a BUY and Magenta for a SELL and must be in a zone between 65 (OverBoughtZone) and 35 (OverSoldZone).

4) Stoploss = High-Low

5) Take profit = R:R 1:1

To Matteorossi :

Here is the setting you ask for, and I am not changing original setting from doctor.

Doctor also already mention the setting in previous post, post 502 and 531 .

Is better you ask question about indicator setting here, because I am not the creator of this system, I just use it blindly .

very good friends, first of all I want to thank you for sharing this system, and I want to ask a question, in this graph if we had entered the red vertical line, in the green candle should we exit? and re-enter in the next signal? thank you very much

--- 帖子 #749 ---
If the candle is green and wicks also green then i usually close the trade irrespective of profit or loss. Or atleast shift SL to the high of the candle. in your pic the wick is grey. Any candle with grey wicks is a consolidation candle. Green candle green wick is a bullish candle. red candle with red wicks is bearish candle. This is how we interpreet APB candles.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
There is a lot of discussion about the histogram. The logic of histogram is simple. For any timeframe our Gann activator is set to 9.

If on M1 the M5 histogram will be 9*5 = 45; M15 histogram will be 9*15 =135 and M30 histogram will be 9*30 =270 so on and so forth.

The advantage over using MTF histo there is no need to wait for the MTF candle to close for confirmation. Also M15 histo on M1 will give color of the last 15 candles (15 minutes) and not the actual candle like from 9.00 to 9.15.

Add as many histograms to a pirticular timeframe as you need.

I ususlly like to refer to 2 timeframes up for lower timeframes for lower timeframes as lower timeframes are used for scalping.

H4 and beyond the trend is already established for swing trades so entries may be taken without histo of D1.

still if needed add 9*4=36 histo on H4 fot D1 on H4

Hope you all understand.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
For convinience I will post a new MTF templete adding histograms of two higher timeframes by tomorrow. I will need to modify the indicator to give proper alerts that can be understood easily.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
This is what i prapose to do.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A trade i just entered. H4 with D1 and W1 hisograms.

As you see on H4 there is a failed breakdown. W1 is in uptrend. But D1 is in downtrend. When D1 color changes to lime the alert ahould be "on H4 D1 ternd change Buy".  meaning the D1 histo on H4 timeframe has changed to uptrend.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Doc,

I may be wrong, but I don't see this pair revisit the extreme highs of 1.30000.

Price has moved up towards the lower/high to reverse downward on the 4H & 1H.

I stand to be corrected.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
You are absolutely right. but as i said, there are setups within setups.

Ordostia had requested to check GBPUSD https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14940699

I had replied immediately to wait for a long setup https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post14940706

Let us analyse my entry in this setup.

Though it does not follow the guidelines of all colours to be the same..... It resembles a failed breakdown.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1) my entry candle is Bullish APB. lime body and wicks.

2) It has broken 2 dynamic resistances TE 3 and TE 9.

3) All subwindow indicatores are lime.

4) RSIOMA in oversold zone turning lime.

These are High risk  high reward trades. Need to monitor carefully. Book loss immediately if you feel that the setup is failing at the end of the H4 candle.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
A follow up at the end of H4 candle ( blue horizontal line)...

1) APB is still bullish candle.

2) This candle was not able to close beyond our guppy lines which act as dynamic resistance.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

IF  the next candle closes above the high of this candle.....

1) either there will be profit booking or

2) Stoplosses will be triggered.

The buyers were strong in last 8 hrs, not allowing to go the price down and pushing the price up.

Again IF  the next candle closes above 1 and 2 .... the price will passively push up independent of strong buyers.

At this point even week buyers will push the price up without any effort. we are weak buyers but at that point all indicatrs will turn blue/lime and that will be entry candle as per guidelines. A sharp upmove with momentum can be expected.

I dont expect any one to understand this at this point of time but ......... " Yeh to trailor hai. Picture abhi baki hai"

What's helped me the most is to look for pullbacks and not reversals, as stated in the rules of this strategy.

Once the trend is confirmed bearish, look for a bearish pullback. Once it's confirmed bullish, look for a bullish pullback.

Me too, the first pullback after 51 change direction is very good, if the trend continue, we just follow the direction of 51 and 9 for entry.

Dotted red lines are entry position when I trade (entry example), follow the colour. I usually exit when the candle colour change or power candle or RSI reach to opposite OS/OB.

Hi ozkanim.

So I have observed that the RISOMA for a good sell trade is always below the SWGHL, in all time frames, at least for XAUUSD, I don't see any others. However, the chart should not be zoomed in vertically, it should be at full size, otherwise the SWGHL will shift. It's just an observation, I don't know if it really has an impact on successful trade, we can try it out.

Hello, first of all, thanks to doc for sharing this great system and everybody else helping to contribute. What great commitment!

Just a question, would it be possible to code a scanner that scans all the pairs so that when all the conditions are met and there is a continuation pattern, an alert will be sent? Scan all the pairs using 4H timeframe + alert when there is a continuation pattern with all the conditions met, in order to take the trades with the highest probabilities in a time frame with the highest success rate. Saves us time and helps us take high quality trades. Just a suggestion

I dont understand why you are rewriting all the indicetors when i have provided all the original MQL4 sourse codes.

Secondly you are flooding the thread with your experrimental indicator files and templets causing a lot of confusion and unwanted comments and replies. i suggest you communicate with me on PM, let us finalise your product and post it here after it is tested by both uou and me.

I will be forced to block you if you dont comply.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Here is a PM to me from a fellow trader and i agree with him completly.

Hi Walvekarraje , thanks again for your generous sharing here on FF.

At this point of the Thread , however, there is a risk. And that is to lose sight of your original system that is based on clear rules, is mechanical and managed by a man.

In fact, I see that many are starting to ask for an EA, some even for a scanner:

I have seen many interesting Threads ruined by Eas.

It works like this: a good trader (like you) publishes his system, with clear rules. After a while, someone comes along and says "Let's make an EA, let's make an EA!"

And all the members of the Thread no longer follow the original (profitable) system, to follow the illusion of an EA that - without effort and without human commitment - makes them all millionaires.

After a while, end of Thread.

EAs are just illusions, the intervention of man/trader will always be indispensable in trading ( and in medicine/surgery ).

Sorry for this long message, but I just wanted to express my humble thought.

All the best.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Any one who is interested to compile EA or SCANNER, communicate with me on my PM first before posting any files or templets here or they will be blocked.

This is the first and only warning.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Man to man, you could've PM'd me instead of adopting the "...if you don't comply" mindset (we were just talking in PM).

I rewrote the indicators because they were outdated and there wasn't an MT5 version. The yellow lines were from the APB candles indicator that ThriftTrader dropped in the thread. It’s a great system, and I still appreciate you and others for the guidance, but it seems like my support isn't wanted here. I’ll remove the indicators and show myself out. Best wishes and much success in your trading journey.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
It has taken my years to learn understand and perfect this. It is annoyung and irritating to see experiments, indicators and templets posted without any backtest and confirmation that they are working. This was my opportunity to stop any one trying to ruin this thread and i took it.

you may PM your indicators and templets to me even for mt5. let us test them together and then you can post the final product here. I think this is a reasonable request.

As promised here are the indicators and templete with hiatogram of next  2 timeframes printing on current timeframe chart.

Please copy and replace all indicators as there are minor changes made for the alerts.

The alerts on histogram are Gann 9 alerts for that timeframe.

The modification in alerts is as follows:

1) PBC alert on TE 3 is the same.

2) TE 51 alert on main chart current time frame will be "TE 51 TREND REVERSED " Buy/Sell

3) Histogram alerts : if there is a change of color in  histogram of D1 on H4 chart; the alert will be "D1 trend reversal on H4" BUY/SELL

The idea is ease of understanding alerts without looking at the chart and which time frame alert is generated on which chart.

The files are uploaded in the first post.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Possible  to minitor all timeframes.

Lastly i would like to add is that the higher timeframe histograms are useful only in scalping on M1 M5 or M15.

H4 is the best timeframe to trade this system  where trend is already formed. Histogram of D1 and W1  on H4 chart might cause confusion.

Thank you Doctor, for these changes.

For those of us trading lower timeframes, the risks are greater when the market is moving sideways.

I have just been monitoring this new template, and I can see where I would have lost a few trades today due to sideways movements.

As a wise person said, one of the secrets to making money is to avoid unnecessary losses.

It's also easier to follow the rules, when you can monitor all indicators on one screen.

Thanks again, and may your hard work and generosity be rewarded in ways even you cannot imagine.

It's very rare in todays world to have someone offer publicly a very good system.

Yes. Initial SL at swing high/low. After TP of one lot is reached,l trail to BE. Then to TE21 , TE9 and finally to TE 3 as the trade progresses. Keep a watch on APB candles. As long as they are in direction of the trade,TE9 is a good trail.

You would be wasting your precious time, looking for something better, because Doctor Walvekar has already put the best at your door for free.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
What dgold means  say by "comprehensive"  is that the histograms will represent Gann 9 trend in the next 2 higher timeframes.

It can be "customised" means that you can add as many histograms of higher timeframes as per your need and trading psyc.

For example, on M5 you can add H1,H4 Gann 9 histograms. ( apart from M15 and M30 which are already there).

Calculation is simple and already explained in one of my previous post.

" Trade the timeframe and Not the Instrument"

A new concept ? NO...Actually it is not new but the original concept in my first post.

The histograms and MTF templete was more of on popular demand rather than my choice.

Hello doctor thanks a lot for everything. i have a coder friend. how can i get him to contact you?

--- 帖子 #874 ---
If he can compile Gann hi lo activator to a subwindow oscillator with fixed minimum and fixed maximum set to either 0 to 100 or 100 to (-100)

This will make a huge diffence in the system.

Hello doctor, I'm Amin, I'm interested in your system, I've been involved in forex for a long time but still don't have a system that really works, can you explain, for transaction order entry, where do we start from or see it first, step by step.., do we first look at the oscillator?, for example, look at the largest time frame first, on H4, and on H4 we look at the rsioma oscillator first then the MA?

This should work in any timeframe.

Trade in the direction of the trend.

The easiest trade is Gann 9 alert on current timeframe. ( lime and magenta lines on chart)

when you get this alert 1) confirm all indicators are of same color. ( the histograms at the bottom of the chart represent next two upper timeframes.).

2) Rsioma lines should not be in overbought or oversold zone.

Enter at the close of the candle.

Manage SL and profit targets as per your trading style.

Please read all the guideline documents in the first post and compre them with live charts.

Get used to the system first. Trade in demo till you are confident.

In the above chart on H4 there is no valid buy trade.

I respect your enthusiasm sir, but...

combining guppy and gann HiLo on main chart makes the chart unreadable and chaotic.

Thats the reason i converted it to a subwindow indicator and it goes very well with Rsioma.

Sir, we are not trading one indicator. we are trading a system where all indicators are in agreement.

With respect, dont try to dissect one buffer in one indicator and screw the whole system.

Good morning, everyone!

I’m very pleased with the Walvekarreje system. I believe it was the missing piece to complement the other system I use, the Shahab8b method. I’ll be sharing my charts here soon.

To give you a heads-up, I’ve been using the Shahab8b system for entries and the Walvekarreje system for exits. I must say that the results from my recent trades have been extremely rewarding!

--- 帖子 #901 ---
please don't hijack this thread with the shahab8b method, seems like a plug for that, on this group we are only focused on one system for enrty and exit to avoid any further confusion

--- 帖子 #902 ---
I had a quick look at Shahab8b COT trread and what hope&glory says is absolutely right.

You said you are using this system for exits. We are all weak in TP and Exits. So will you please explain how use this for Exits?

--- 帖子 #903 ---
I think much better results are obtained when trading with trading conditions below the magenta cloud. what is your opinion on this? And of course rsioma should not be in extreme buying and selling zones

--- 帖子 #904 ---
True.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Since I started using this system on 10 July, I have doubled my account. Small numbers but it proves the system works.

I was actually at a point where I was evaluating what it will take to make my FX trading journey successful, because it seemed nothing I tried was working.

I have taken stupid trades I shouldn't take. Not following the rules. At times revenge trading. I have closed out winning trades too early.

The stupid mistakes I made, annoyed me but made me refocus and try to understand the system better.

I am now calmer and work to analyse each trade before taking it.

I will keep working on staying in the trade for as long as necessary but not be too greedy.

The miracle is that this system found me by divine guidance.

Doctor Walvekarraje, I cannot thank you enough for creating such a simple but powerful system with clear and simple rules to follow.

I wish my words had more power, but I bless you everyday and I send you God's blessings and protection.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Congratulations. what timeframe are you using? also, is there anything important that you observe in this method before entering the process?

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Please note: I am still learning myself, so you will have to understand the system according to your temperament.

I trade XAUUSD on M5. The biggest learning is to align with the higher timeframe.

All colours of 5 minutes aligned with M15,M30 and H1 tend to be good trades.

If the highest timeframe(in my case H1) has the TE51 alert(the star), this gives very high probability outcomes.

Personal lesson: Be Patient, and wait for the right trades. Some days the market has no money to give.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hmm...very similar to mine. Any news on the scanner yet? Since it was mentioned earlier...

I use a different system for my entries, where I enter the order early, risking only 1% of my total capital. Then, I wait for the Guppy system to come into play.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
I am constantly on the screen to find suitable conditions. I set up a telegram group. to make this and similar joint information. but there was no participation. that is, there was participation, but only as a member of the group. no one expressed an opinion. so I deleted it. my suggestion to you is that everyone should share here when appropriate conditions occur in the time frames they want. Otherwise we can't do it by looking at the screen all the time.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
It is not very common to have a bullish APB candle followed immediately by a bearish APB candle.(start of new week, ie first monday candle or news impact can be a major reason) Usually there is any/some type of consolidation candle and we get a chance to re-evaluate out trade. Any way in the guidelines and in my replies also i have mentioned that if an opposite APB candle is printed, i exit the trade irrespective of the profit/loss or shift my SL to the high/low of that candle depending on the situation. After all not all trades will be profitable and money management is equally important. Our aim is to identify high probablity trades, maximise the profits and most important of all is to keep losses to minimum.

--- 帖子 #925 ---

What time frame do you trade on? And how are you approaching it? A friendly piece of advice: try trading on H1 or H4. Shorter time frames can make it challenging to achieve consistent profits. Use pending orders and proper risk management. Control your emotions—if you lose what you were prepared to lose in a day, close your computer and come back tomorrow. Not trading is also part of the strategy.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
Hello! I believe that the Guppy system has its advantages and can be quite effective in many situations. However, I've noticed that while my exits using Fibonacci were not as good, exits using the Guppy system have been much better due to entering the trade earlier. Combining the Guppy system's recommendations with Fibonacci-based entries has shown even more positive results for me. Each system has its strengths, and adjusting strategies to complement Guppy can really enhance the results

--- 帖子 #951 ---
I believe it's RAJESH D1 and W1 for the longer-term trends.  The doctor suggested they were not necessary when trading H4, so I don't really consider them when I'm taking a trade.

Dear people,

to all new visitors to this thread, I would like to ask you a question.

Do you only read the last page of a book and then question the author about the content?

I don't think that's advisable, I would feel like I've missed something.

This thread is 48 pages long because a lot of people discussed a lot of important things.

If you really can't make money with this brilliant, easy-to-understand trading strategy, you should think about whether Forex trading is the right thing for you.

All you have to do is, follow the original instructions. It's the same as mom baking a bread and the only thing you have to do is, eating the bread.

You all should keep this valuable thread alive, going with really good contributions.

A good place to start would be to begin reading on page one.

With kind regards.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Ditto!

I think exactly the same, Michael.

Thanks a lot to Dr. Rahesh, for the system and this thread.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
True. I have used fibonacci a lot and you will find many posts in the other guppy thread.

But with APB and RSIOMA the need to use fibo got eliminated.

After the entry, as long as the APB candle color is in your favour and RSIOMAS are not flattening, your trade is safe. This way it is possible to remain in the trend for long time. If the APB show consolidation or the candle size becomes smaller or the RSIOMAS start flatteninng,(this will usually happen simaltaneously),and it means that the trend is loosing its strength, it is time to either book profit or shift SL to low / high of the previous candle.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
I think Eddyrj 's COT  system can give very early entries but it is very difficult to understand for me.

What i recommend is to compare entries with whatever system you were/are following with guppy entries. You might find guppy entries are earlier and more reliable.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
I cant agree more.

Also start with demo account or smaller trades till you get used to reading the charts in real time. Just wait color of all indicators to agree. Wait for the close of candle.

--- 帖子 #959 ---
On Point. You hit the nail on the head bruh. Not many people understand this simple logic bruh. I started reading this freaking awesome thread from the beginning and it has proved invaluable for me. Many of the questions I should have asked, I got them from the first 5 pages of this thread. If you're new to this system, I suggest you do as @Michael.MSA says.

Besides, I was able to come up with a strategy that makes it possible for me to enter trades on the 5M time frame using the 15M time frame and which I'm still testing right now and seems promising. And hope to share when the good Doctor approves.

Hey Doc @walvekarraje, I replied your message on Telegram. Please if you have the time you might want to check it out.

Regards,

Olatunde.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
I think this system is very simple, just follow the colors.

My advice for those who just joined and tried this system, you should keep trying until you really know how this system works, without IF, BUT and HOW ABOUT.

You will smile to yourself when you realize how easy this system is.

Remember, do not add and do not reduce even 1 indicator in this system.

If a system does not work, do not blame the system first, but check yourself again. The system did not make a mistake, you made the decision to buy/sell and close.

Until today I use this system, I only change the colour, because my eyes can't stand bright colours.

Good Luck .

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Hi Doc

Something is wrong for me.

The RAR files contain code that are MT4 and I must compile those before I put them on the chart. As you see, a lot is missing on my chart. I believe it is because I miss files like several copies of RTE 25 and RSIOMA with different values. But I cannot find this described anywhere. See post 14 compared to mine.

I have read documentation 3 times and likewise the 2 first pages. A solution to setting up should have showed up by then.

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Also be aware that this system, like all other systems do have a number of losing trades in a row. Zoom in to the statistic at the top of the page and you will see, that the trader had 6 losses in a row one time.

So keep going. It will come.

3 reasons. You need to be attentive and manually move the stoploss at end of every bar. If you trade many pairs, it is nice to have one of the tasks made for you. Then you can concentrate on finding trades. You can call it a day and leave the screen and let this robot finish the work.

That is not fair. I allways read the whole thread. But not without having the chart setup. That would be a waste of time. Do you really mean, that when I cannot setup the chart, I should read 25 pages to be sure that I haven't missed anything before I ask ??? Would you do that ???

It would however be fair to believe, that problems about setup and the right templates, descriptions etc is on place within the 2 first pages. So that were as long as I went. Many times. And I read the documentation many times.

And when Post#1 specify "GUPPY RE-INVENTED" RAR at the very top, it is fair to believe, that this is the RAR to use. If not, then it should be removed.

Post #37 by OP indicated that setup problems were solved. So no need to read 25 pages.

The RAR that you show me now, has the headline "Indicators and templete with histogram and modified alerts." So this is believed to be a modification - not the main thing hiding at the very bottom of post #1.

Post #1 really needs a refresh.

But thank you, I guess this will solve the problem.

That JBLANKED guy is really annoying. And it is not my style to change anything in the existing indicators and templates. What a jerk. Tried to take over the thread and the fantastic work of the doctor.

I will now quitely start reading from post#1. I might make a robot, but I will not publish it in the thread. So you will not be disturbed with my getting rich fantasies. Yes I have them :-)

But hey, a new day is rising and trading is number 1 priority.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Hi RiskFighter

I'm really happy about that. Once you have read the entire content, you will know exactly how Doctor Rajesh's original system works. Maybe it will save you from wasting precious time developing a robot.

For example, an autopilot in an airplane only works when everything is going normally; when things get difficult, the pilots have to work.

Trading robots have no idea about trading, you have to tell them everything and thinking for them. I belive it's a waste of time. Think about it, what would be, when there really is a trading robot that could trade so successfully that a trader is satisfied. The same thing would happen as in a casino with roulette. The players who can successfully outsmart the roulette in the casino will be banned very quickly.

I can imagine that the brokers would quickly change the trading conditions to our detriment. The brokers are used to making money, if they can no longer do that, because a genius built a valuable robot and released it for free, you can be sure that the brokers would do something to stop it. But because that is not possible, there is nothing to fear.

You will definitely think differently once you have read all the content, you will definitely not be disappointed.

Now we can think about the new trading day.

Have a successful day.

I would be happy to read more about your successes and experiences.

With kind regards.

Hi RiskFighter,

There are two versions of the system. The first version on Page 1, which the Doctor advises everyone to trade on H4 and higher. For that, you simply place all files except for .tpl in the Indicators folder, and the .tpl in templates.

Later, he released a leaner version for M1 M5 for anyone wishing to trade lower timeframes with health warning that he has not tested on lower timeframes, but believes it should work.

You can see the details of that here :: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14931465

You will copy the Histogram into indicators, and .tpl into templates, then open a new chart, drag the histogram on to the chart, then open the template.

There are discussions about settings on this page :: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...vented?page=27

Which timeframes do you want to trade?

Hope this helps you get the issue resolved.

Nope the issue is not resolved. Don't use more time on this. I gave up and have unsubscribed from the thread. I have my own strategies and robots which works, so I am not in any need.

But thank you for trying to help.

thank god, and good riddens .. always complaining, only reason to be on this thread was to get another EA to his collection of 5000 others, lazy attitude and truth is just too lazy to use the system how it was invented to be used, suggest you carry on dreaming your get rich fantasies without putting some real effort in.

I don't know by you, but I use minimum 10 hours on this hobby daily. You cannot call me lazy.

Complaining - well, I tried for many days to get some help for this issue, and I was only called an idiot that does not know how to read a thread. I have now made my own Guppy using the standard - no not lazy. However I cannot find it to be better than the stuff I have.

And by the way I have started 24 threads where I have tried to share things with people. How many threads was it that you shared?? Me Lazy??

You have 60 posts - I have 1.200 posts. Who is lazy here?

You Dumass.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
you back ? That was a short victory speech that I'm going and 5 mins later you're back... just great

Please start your EA threads (most which are just links to other people's work, clearly you don't have any intelligence to create anything from your own credit.

So please read post 999 then read 10 times then ask questions ... thankyou

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
One of all the things that you don't know Mr. Glory, is that even when I unsubscribed, all comments to my posts will be visible for me. So remove that laugh and learn how the forum works.

To you and all other in this thread that cannot read. In my footer i write "Read post #1". You all keep referring it as read the whole thread. It is not what I write. And that is because OP should secure that all vital information is in post #1. That is how FF works. At least the setup of the charts and the description of the strategy should be correct and updated.

I have read Post#1 many times - including each and every Word document. And I have downloaded everything and put it on charts - several times. I have been in this forum for 7 years. I am present in the threads I follow every day, including weekends. I normally have no problems. I am able to understand more about MT4 than most people, so when I this time for once ask a question, it is not because I have been to lazy to solve my problem. And you guys could have tried to help in stead of asking me to read 25 pages.

Regarding intelligence Mr. Glory, let people read your contributions since you started in 2007 and let people read mine. Was it around 60 very intelligent posts? Regarding my intelligence I am shure my CV will over match yours in all aspects.

I am sure Mr. Glory, that you will find some more laughs to cast on me. And I am sure it will never stop. So I end it from my part here.

All other than Mr. Glory, don't reply to my posts, I want to get out of the thread.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
are you still here? Theres a really good thread called 'I own 20,000 EAs but I still don't know which one to use'. My word of glorious advice would be to join that.

Thanks and close the door behind you as you leave and mind it doesn't knock your head and remove any brain cells you may need to run another EA

Right now we can all get back to this great thread

Yes, no system is ever too complicated to code into an EA, if the rules are clear and unambiguous.

It is only impossible to code a discretionary EA, when the main rule is that the trader must use intuition.

Of course, it is always possible to code a Trade Manager EA, if the rules for the management are also clear and unambiguous.

You were correct in your posts, and it looks like most people don't really know what they're talking about, but they think that they are smart and they know - which is a typical Dunning-Kruger Effect.

Don't waste your time fighting Trolls!

EURUSD on H4 is in a nice uptrend with good support at TE 21. The Guppies are evenly spread and all other indicators are well alligned including the HTF histograms. In this case it is reasonable to beleive that the previous high will be taken out to acheive a higher high.

Only caution is a start of new week, so how the first candle prints is imp. If it is a bullish APB the target is possible.

Hi hope&glory

It's nice that there are people who are trying for other people to find out whether one can earn money automatically.

Where would we be if only one of the many thousands EA developers had created a really usable EA?
What would do that genius?

1. Maybe use the automatic money maker for hisself and not tell anyone about it?

2. Or release the long-awaited device for free?

3. Or simply selling the machine for a dreamfull price without having to take any further risks?

I belive thinking about it is just as wasteful of time as developing such a machine.

A small sentence comes into my mind.

An unsuccessful person asks a successful person, "Please can you tell me how I can get rich quickly and easily?"

The successful person answers: "No, unfortunately I can't, but I can tell you how you can become poor quickly and easily, namely if you try to become rich quickly and easily.

Is that true?

Maybe one should definitely try it out one time?

Kind regards

You are refering to the HTF histogram which is lime.

Just look at the chart and the price action.

This is a failed breakout with lower highs and lower lows. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Though i have set TP for one lot, It is reasonable to expect the price to break the recent lower low.

If the HTF lime histo changes to magenta! It will be a extremly profitable trade.

As all indicators are in my favour at present except the lime histogram.

I will not trail my SL till 1) my first target is reached .

or 2) there is a bullishh APB candle at its close on H4.

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Ok. Let me explain and clear your concerns.

1) We are trading the Guppy Multiple moving averages System.

This is a trend trading system.

2)  TE 51 is the only alert on a live candle. all the rest of the alerts are on the close of the candle.

3) TE 51 alert means a change in the trend.

4) As a trader knowledge of DOW theory, higher high, higher low, lower hihg lower low....

If you learn ABC only then you can understand DEF.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
My entry was at blue line. When i saw the chart there was already a signal (yellow star in circle) 2 candles back and price was around the close of that candle. so i took a sell trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now the first target is done easily and my SL is now at breakeven. As the trade progresses i will trail it further down.

TE 51 is Trend Envelope on 51 EMA.

Guppy uses Multiple EMAs. I use trend envelope indicator. All the lines you see on main chart are trend envelops from 3 to 51.

I use these values for trailing stoploss  so sometimes it is reffered as SL 51.The values in data window are TE 3,9,21 and 51`from above below

My final trailing SL is usually TE 3 or SL 3 (that is the first value in data window)

Today is a crucial day on my trading journey. I traded my small test account back to my original capital.

I had lost 64% of the account(and blown another) before finding Guppy re-invented. As per my previous post I managed to double the account from my starting point.

My goal was to recover my original capital. Today I achieved that while learning this system, and working through my trading demons.

The last three trading days, I found a setup that works for me, and I use it as a traffic light system, which has been very helpful, and stops me from taking impulsive and reckless trades. I am still work in progress. The plan is now to scale the account.

The rules are simple, when the Gann in all 3 screens align, open a trade in the direction of the Gann

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
Hi TT

You want Vertical Gann and Histo as the same colour on all Timeframes.

I start my SL around 50pips or above the TE51 whichever is safer on the M5 chart.

The trades are taken on the M5 chart and M15 and M30 are there for trend confirmation.

2. Could you please provide your logic of the SL\TP for this trade? (we see lashes higher you SL and levels more near then your TP)

Thank you for all your sharring!

Sure, I use it for a long time since Doctor shared, thank you

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
Once the M30 candle closes and the Gann Line is drawn in alignment with M5 and M15, I take the trade.

My conceptual target is around 50pips, however, this setup gives around 130pips from the star trigger on M5. I obviously don't enter the trade on the star, so can't collect all 130.

I set my TP as high as possible, then monitor price momentum. If there is a lot of momentum, I try to collect as many pips as possible.

I always manually close the trade when I sense exhaustion in the momentum.

I just go out of this trade with 72pips manually because it was approaching 2500.00 which is a key level.

Hi PereRaphael,

Thanks for sharing your experience and insight. If you don't mind, it would help me if you could point me in right direction on setting up 3 tf screen like yours. When I use Guppy template, it comes with with same screen as ours for 15m but not for 5 and 30m. May be I am missing something so thought I would seek some information. May be the indicators use on those tf or template file would be helpful.

Thankyou.

Hi PereRaphael

That was a good trade. Entry TE 51

So, now there are already 2 good trading methods.

This one at M5, with confirmation at M15 and M30.

And the other one, the trading method, at H4 with H1.

I think both are very good and very reliable.

The only thing what one urgently need is patience to wait for the right situation.

I believe that if one know that it works, then one can have the necessary patience.

Thank you so much Dr. Rajesh and PereRaphael.

The templete already has next 2 timeframe histograms representing the direction of Gann 9 in that timeframe.

On the M5 chart The first histogram at the bottom is Gann 9 on M15 and second is Gann9 on M30.

Ideally it is possible to analyse the higher time frame trend on one chart.

In M5 if both histograms are magenta, just wait for a pullback on M5 (Lime vertical line) and continuation pattern (magenta vertical line ) to enter the trade and vise versa. This is easier to understand .

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
This my todays trade on H4

TE 51 alert indicating change to downtrend.

Both histograms magenta.

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
This is very very important.

Looking at three charts simultaneously may work well for PereRaphael, but it might not be the best approach for everyone.

Take the time to study and understand the system. It’s designed to provide clear visual cues without the need for additional analysis.

Ultimately, it’s always better to develop your own trading style rather than trying to replicate someone else's.

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
One more important point I want to emphasize:

In trading, you’re not just trading the instrument—you’re trading the timeframe.

Each timeframe can show a different trend for the same instrument.

I prefer to trade on the H4 timeframe because, by the time a signal appears on the chart, the trend is already well-established in the lower timeframes. If the histograms also align with this trend, it becomes a perfect continuation trade, consistent across both lower and higher timeframes. This approach allows for low-risk, high-reward trades with calculated risks.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
I dont mean to be rude but i will insist again....

Study , understand, use this system to your benifit as you please but dont confuse and complicate by posting diffrent templetes and indicators.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
At this point I would like to explain the logic behind "breakout PullBack Continuation" (PBC) trades. and trading reversals on TE 51 ( only alert in our system on open candle).
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1) The weekly histogram (bottom of chart) is bearish.

2) the daily histogram ( last but one at bottom of chart was bullish)

3) the guppy on main chart was bullish.

THis is a pullback in a downtrend where buyers are aggressive.

When TE 51 is broken on the downside... the Stoplosses of buyers in the blue rectangle will trigger pushing the price down. at the same time the buyers in the red and faint blue rectangles will start booking profits pushing the price still down. So without any aggressive sellers the price will fall and if aggressive sellers enter, the price will gain momentum on the downside........ This will happen till aggressive buyers enter the market indicated by a bullish APB candle on our chart.

Hi Doctor.  I appreciate your feedback a few posts back.  I am not here to gamble but to learn, and I will be following your method as it is laid out.  Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
Please ignore my words about gambling.

Your trade was against all the guidelines we are following.

"Closed EURUSD trade, -11 pips. Second guessing myself, playing it safe."

That was the right thing to do. Retrospectively looking at the chart it was a minor pullback and your loss would have been much bigger.

"Price is at top of weekly range so could reverse, that's the only reason I thought a short may work out."

Could reverse and short may work out...... this is a hope trade, and all hope trades are hopeless trades.

In this system Guppy multiple moving averages  act as support and our intension is to identify entry candle which is in continuation of the existing trend.

We are following a system based on technical analysis based on multiple indicators with a hope of identifying low risk high reward trades.

The Plan is to Trade when all indicators ( colors ) agree....

Plan the Trade and then Trade the Plan.

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Right question. All of us are trying to find an answer to....

Let me try to answer this to the best of my knowledge and the indicator system i have shared with you all......

1) Enter trade at the close of the candle. Make sure all the indicator colors agree.

Initial SL is swing high/low or TE 51 in the data window.

Entry with 2 lots.

First target for 1 lot with R:R 1:1

There are only 2 possibilities...a) SL for both lots will be hit or 2) target of one lot will be hit.

If SL is hit you are out of the trade automatically.

2) If SL is not triggered, watch APB candles. As long as the candle color is in your favour, the trade is safe.

(lime body and wicks: bullish candle, magenta body and wick: bearish candle. Any other colour combination is consolidation candle)

Wait for close of candle.

As long as the APB candles are in your your favour, dont change SL or TP.

3) When the APB candles show consolidation, watch RSIOMA. If there is no change in color of RSIOMA.... dont change SL or TP.

4) If. a) APB candle color changes to bulish (if you are short) or bearish (if you are long) OR b) any one or more RSIOMA color changes at the close of the candle...

Book profit or loss irrespective of SL or TP.

5) TP for second lot... your choice.

Lot 1: TP1 reached 21 pips

1st Decision with Lot 2: TP2 BE if SL goes to BE after TP1. Total 2 Lots 21 pips.

2nd Decision with Lot 2: TP2 -3 pips if the operation is closed due to the color change of the APB candle in H4. Total 2 Lots 18 pips.

Again your logic is perfect as per guidelines.

More important is that on H1 this sell could be initiated at the close of last but one candle before your entry candle.

In your chart notice the 3 flags printed by the lime coloured lines... followed by a RTE 3 PBC alert (Yellow hollow circle).

Please read "TRADING MINOR PULLBACKS: “buy on dip” and “sell on rally”." topic in the guppy re-invented document in 1st post.

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
From the time stamp of your post I guess this have something to do with NY close and Sydney open spread increase.

Copied the following from link https://www.asiaforexmentor.com/what...market%20opens. :

Most financial centers have overlapping operating hours, except for the transition between New York to Sydney. New York closes at 10pm and Sydney is just starting to open, leading to low liquidity and higher spread. The spread usually remains this way until the Tokyo market opens.

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
This happens when brokers run out of liquidity, some markets open, others close, and there are a few minutes when spreads go up. This is what happened to me in post 1113.

Both went straight to SL...bummer.  Total train wreck.  No attempt to manage trade, I was a bit sidetracked during these trades.  It is demo, but no excuse for not taking seriously.  In the future I'll try exiting trade when candle gives opposite color so not to go to full SL.

My dear friend. Please post the full picture, not a trailer.

See how i post my pics with explaination and my trade explorer.

"3 not good signals in a row." what your pic shows?  there is no time frame , there is no history.

May be this is the end/exaustion of the trend.

have you traded these in real time? in a demo account at least?

or are you just looking at the historical charts and trying to pinpoint the flaws?

I will answer to the best of my knowledge or understanding if you give me the picture.

Any way, I never said that all the trades will be in profit.

Maybe the doctor has some thoughts on this?

[quote=Wally1953;14980675]
The initial stoploss is before you decide to enter a trade. It is a calculated risk. How much you can afford to loose in the trade and what profit you expect.

The moment your entry is triggered, it is up to you how to minimise the loss and when to book profit.

In the rule posted by doctor, it is indicated: RSIOMA AND GANN BOTH must be in overbought zone (above 80) to go short and oversold zone (below 20) to go long.

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
That's the rule for TREND REVERSAL ENTRY.

For entry with the trend All indicators should be Line/Blue for buy and Red Magenta for sell. In the image provided by since80808 entries 1 and 3 have correct colors but entry 2 doesn't have all colors correct (one on the lines on the GANN is wrong) but it get correct color one candle later. The problem in this case are

not the indicators but the entries are directly into resistance.

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
Just took this trade on USDJPY.

I believe this qualifies as a trend reversal trade, am I correct?

My plan is to get out early if I get a closed magenta candle.

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Doctor, I think this is an excellent system. It is possible that some of us need to adapt it to our personality or type of trader, conservative, aggressive, etc. The time available is also important. "IT IS WONDERFUL" I have been doing this for a few years and I have never had something so easy to operate and with an excellent percentage of success and ratios.

In my case, I never enter without keeping in mind that the H1 chart guarantees me a lower SL, which allows me to do intraday operations that are sometimes very easy and fast. Not all operations have to be in H4. I have the necessary time to do this in H1 and improve the ratios, being more selective with the signals.

CONGRATULATIONS and thank you very much for sharing this excellent system.

Dear Doctor, let me describe "my AAA scenario" of using your system. If you say it's wrong at all or going against your rules, then I delete this post at once for not confusing future readers.

I've found for myself that I get my best results (with less trades) on H4 when I take

only the first continuation signal (#4)
after the reversal signal (#1)

and after forming a visible new trend (#2)
when it's according to the HTF histogram (#3)

(with the initial SL at the nearest extremum, TP1=SL, then moving SL to BE and trailing the next target)

Thank you for your great work (and excuse me for my Eastern European English)

--- 帖子 #1161 ---

Hi ozkanim,

I'm realy surprised. Maby you can ask Dr. Rajesh if he can explain his trading strategy to you again.

If one see something like that on your chart, one quickly get the impression that something about his trading strategy is still not understood.

With kind regards.

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
same question :think:

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
Hi bitgiggy.

This chart is an H4 chart, the top histogram is D1, the bottom one shows the weekly histogram.

So the weekly histogram is colored magenta because the main weekly trend is SELL. The daily histogram shows a small BUY, which was already stopped at a resistance at 0.57861.

To get back to your question. With such a trading entry against the main trend, it makes no sense to wait for the weekly histogram. In most cases it is only a short, quick trade that takes place, which should be monitored carefully after entry. I hope I explained this correctly.

With kind regards

--- 帖子 #1187 ---
Hi Wally.

Isn't it a bit early to enter? At the moment the price is stuck at a support line in H1.

The D1 histogram is still green. I think the H4 candle would be better if it is completely outside of the green guppies. Risoma is also not where it should be. I hope you get good luck, at least the main trend is in SELL, so it could work, but it's still quite a high risk.

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
Hi everyone.

I would like to present an idea:

But first a short introduction.

What do you think is the most dangerous thing in trading? There are certainly several things, but what I mean is the success in trading, which I'm sure many of you already had.

So anyone who is successful in trading feels good and safe, and that is exactly what is dangerous. Then you come up with the idea to do it even better now, because you believe that now I got it, that's how it works, and what works with few money will work also with more money.

To open a trading order in itself is not difficult, but it is difficult not to do anything, to wait patiently and to observe.

And that's exactly where my idea comes in:

There are many people in this group who all like to respect the tradingsystem from Dr. Rajesh. We all operate in many different time zones, what is very good for us. So we all could trade together.

So, if you want, you can post signals from your favorite trading pairs every day, every moment, like Wally1953 is doing. So I mean in the H4 timeframe chart, where all trading conditions are met like Dr. Rajesh showed us. Or where all trading conditions could probably be met shortly, but only in the H4 chart.

Then don't trade immediately, first communicate about it with different people who are currently online. In the H4 chart we have more time, the candles don't change so quickly, which is a big advantage.

Don't forget: We could also create a few internal rules, such as: no trading on fridays from the second half of the day, or being particularly careful when there is red news, etc. Anyway whatever you mean could be important for a rule.

Then everyone can open his trades together with the group members at the same time, in demo or live account.

I am convinced that we will learn from each other very quickly and safely and can become a very good trading community. This is certainly not only a lot of fun, but also definitely brings profits.

How do you like this idea?

With kind regards

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
I like this idea

--- 帖子 #1190 ---
Be careful if you SWING.

Another STOP due to the increase in the spread of the brokers due to lack of liquidity, this problem has a bad solution. You cannot operate with adjusted or normal stops at this time. We went from 0.7 to 19 pips of Spread.

Is it worth operating with double stops?

Reflection:

1st If the first lot is a 1:1 ratio under normal circumstances, wouldn't it be better to consider 2:1 since the spreads in hours of low liquidity are excessively high and this causes us to have more losses. Therefore the 1:1 ratio is unrealistic.

2nd To improve the statistics for this reason, we cannot ADJUST THE STOP in a graph smaller than H4, so it would not be better for the smallest operations graph to be H4, so the main graph would be D1.

I would like to discuss this topic and know what the doctor thinks, since he is the one with the most experience in this system.

If we do INTRADAY this should not affect us.

[quote=Michael.MSA;14985772]Hola a todos. Me gustaría presentar una idea: Pero primero una pequeña introducción. ¿Qué creen que es lo más peligroso en el trading? Seguramente hay varias cosas, pero a lo que me refiero es al éxito en el trading, que estoy seguro que muchos de ustedes ya han tenido. Así que cualquiera que tenga éxito en el trading se siente bien y seguro, y eso es exactamente lo que es peligroso. Entonces se les ocurre la idea de hacerlo aún mejor ahora, porque creen que ahora lo entiendo, así es como funciona, y lo que funciona con poco dinero también funcionará con más dinero. Abrir una orden de trading en sí no es difícil, pero es difícil no hacer nada, esperar pacientemente y observar. Y ahí es exactamente donde entra mi idea: Hay muchas personas en este grupo a las que les gusta respetar el sistema de trading del Dr. Rajesh. Todos operamos en muchas zonas horarias diferentes, lo que es muy bueno para nosotros. Así que todos podríamos operar juntos. Entonces, si quieres, puedes publicar señales de tus pares de trading favoritos todos los días, en todo momento, como lo hace Wally1953. Me refiero al gráfico de marco temporal H4, donde se cumplen todas las condiciones de trading, como nos mostró el Dr. Rajesh. O donde probablemente se puedan cumplir todas las condiciones de trading en breve, pero solo en el gráfico H4. Entonces no operes de inmediato, primero comunícate con diferentes personas que estén en línea en ese momento. En el gráfico H4 tenemos más tiempo, las velas no cambian tan rápido, lo cual es una gran ventaja. No lo olvides: también podríamos crear algunas reglas internas, como: no operar los viernes a partir de la segunda mitad del día, o ser especialmente cuidadoso cuando hay noticias rojas, etc. De todos modos, lo que sea que quieras decir podría ser importante para una regla. Entonces todos pueden abrir sus operaciones junto con los miembros del grupo al mismo tiempo, en una cuenta demo o real. Estoy convencido de que aprenderemos unos de otros muy rápido y de forma segura y podemos convertirnos en una muy buena comunidad de trading. Esto ciertamente no solo es muy divertido, sino que también definitivamente trae ganancias. ¿Qué te parece esta idea? Un cordial saludo.

Excellent idea.

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
The hour from the close of the NY session to the Sydney opening every day there is a significant increase in spreads and this must be taken into account if you have an open trade because a tight stop may possibly be swept in that time frame. Then, you have to be in that hour pending of the operation, either you remove the stop (not recommended) or you enlarge it until the storm passes.

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
Hi Michael. At this point it has broken through that support line and seems to be heading in right direction. I will try to pay more attention to price action, support/resistance, before taking a trade. Thanks for pointing that out!

I am used to trade H4 charts without the HTF histograms. I introduced the HTF histograms as many traders refer to higher timeframe trend for analysis and with the histograms it is easier to refer to a single chart eliminiting the need to swith between charts.

The histograms only represent the TREND color of Gann 9 in HTF.

But since80808 did an excellent backtest and analysis in post 1162 https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...7#post14982107 and i am sure the results of his "AAA scenario" will generate better results.

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
No, i have not switched to forex. I only trade Indian equities in cash. As Indian markets are open only 6 hrs 15 min, I need to observe only two H4 candles and is easier for me to enter or exit trades.In my line of work it is impossible for me to be in front of the charts all the time. I am a long term investor. I trade only 9 instruments and instead of booking profits, i accumulate shares from the profit as a long term investment.

Also keeping H4 timeframe as a standard, will give enough time for others to communicate and comment on the quality of the  trade.

1) We don't consider uptrend till all the guppies are lime/blue. So the uptrend right that you mentioned is a pullback. This will be clear when I explain the guppy mma  and how we interpret it on our charts.

2) Ignoring the histograms, both the entry candles you mentioned are correct. First will hit SL and second eill give good profits.

The question is how to manage the first trade which will hit stoploss any way .

Look at the APB candles following your first entry. All have lime body.

Now third candle after your entry is a bullish APB. (no lower wick, very small upper wick). Also the lower two Rsioma have changed color. Meaning either the trend strength is decreasing or this is a false breakdown.

Here either book loss at the close of this candle or move SL to this candle high. This way you can minimise your loss.

H4 charts give adequate time to analyse the trade and act accordingly.

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
a massive congrats  well deserved , really pleased for you

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
After entry, APB candles and Rsioma are the best guide to manage trades. As long as they agree and dont cahnge color, the trade is safe.

If the APB body color changes but Rsioma do not, it is time to trail SL to minimise loss. When any of the Rsioma also change color, its time to exit the trade.

I have answred your question to the best of my knowledge.

#2) The buyers in #1 are booking profit. So it is a pullback.

#3) The TE 51 break is a false breakdown (star in circle on chart) because the RSIOMAS are in oversold zone #4

As there is no follow through on the lower side for the next five H4 candles, false breakdown is confirmed.( Absence of strong sellers)

#5) Gann 9 alert (lime vertical line). Rsioma changing to lime/blue in oversold zone and gann lines in subwindow changing to lime.

All confirm uptrend will be resumed.

Entry with 2 lots. first target R:R 1:1 acheived. Moved SL to breakeven.

Now it is a risk free trade. As long as APB and Rsioma are bullish, hold position.

If the histogram 1 turns lime.... it will turn out to be a extremly profitable trade.

In H4, entry at close of candle. Not at high.

Even if you miss the entry, place limit order at the close of the candle. Very high chance the entry will be triggered.

This looks good so far, but I would still wait for the D1 histogram, and that is a candle above the magenta guppies.

Here I can't trust the EURUSD, I need the D1 histogram green too. In this case I miss experience. But I think Wally has a good instinct for entering into a trade. But I would still wait of green D1 Histo.

Hello friends.

I believe here comes soon a good trading opportunity. When the lower weekly histogram changes to color magenta, you should be ready. The 4 horizontal yellow lines are possible take profit points.

The weekly histogram is Lime since march 2024 on H4

If you scroll back the chart, more than 80% the times the weekly histogram is bullish.

Probably it is wise to wait for buying opportunity rather than going short.

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
The Weekly histogram on H4 chart is too far fetched for me. I am used to trade H4 without any HTF histogram. A basic technical analysis is maximum requirement to read the charts.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This can be considered as a failed breakout.

GU was in nice uptrend. Lastly it formed a lower low and lower high. Note that it tried to get support at TE 51 but failed to break the previous high.Break of TE 51 again after a lower high is good enough to go short. White vertical line is entry candle.

First Target already done, SL to breakeven for second lot.

D1 histogram in favour of short But W1 histo bullish (which i ignored).

Now will not trail SL till APB candles print magenta.

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
That's exactly right, I agree. I missed to check the weekly histogram from the past. For this reason, I think it's good that we talk about it before we place an order.

This might be the right way to learn more about it. Furthermore, we now know that in this case it is unnecessary to wait for the weekly hitogram.

Thank you Dr. for this important information.

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
I like it.

We definitely have to acustumbrate us to read the charts correctly in that way, which also improves our experience. I feel, that we need much more convesations about the trading, even if one sometimes have to repeat some things.

Now that the last two candles have closed below the previous support, the logical target will be 61.8% fibo retracement and second 50%.

Let us see how long this trend continues. SL shifted to previous candle high which is well above the previous support.

Hello dear Doctor!
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So looking at the previous candle is it time to minimize SL? But it looks like uptrend pullback - no?

And looking at the curent candle (if it close magenta) is it time to close the trade?

Or maybe "ABP+RSIOMA color rule" is for profit (the second) trades only (not for moving the initial SL)?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
Previous candle : consolidation candle. No action required.

Current candle : Magenta APB (body and wicks) with Gann 9 sell alert and change in Rsioma color... square off long trade irrespective of profit / loss at the close of the candle.

Suggest to make your bar chart color to none so the APB candles will be clearly visible, especially the wicks.

The same chart on the same timeframe.

Let us analyse it.

EURNZD is in downtrend as per basics of technical analysis. Lower high, lower low, previous support acts as resistence (marked by arrows) etc etc. A keen eye might notice Rsioma divergence also.

As per our chart if at the close of the candle 1) The Gann 9 alert persists . 2) The Rsiomas remain red and curving down from the overbought zone. 3) ignoring the D1 histogram , The weekly histo is bearish....

https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post14985772

As suggested by Michael " where all trading conditions could probably be met shortly, but only in the H4 chart."

Any reason not to go short?

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
My bad - I agree with your analysis according to the previous trend and the current resistance. (But  I see HH and HL in the "new" (fake? mini?) uptrend)

As for me - guppy under the current candle  As I understand it's a continuation signal for you - you are brave enough to take continuations on such an old trend - not for my nerves

--- 帖子 #1246 ---
Perfect answer "As for me - guppy under the current candle " are lime...

" As I understand it's a continuation signal for you" Not until I get the TE 51 sell alert on the candle close. And all indicatore turn red/magenta.

The GBPAUD trade analysis.... Equal highs followed by lower low lower high meaning resistance followed by start od downtrend, previous highs acting as resistance....followed by TE 51 and Gann 9 alert on the same candle and D1 histo turning magenta on the same candle...perfect short  entry at the close of candle. Michael was worried about the previous low acting as support but all indicators were bearish, hence i had  TP of one lot well below. that TP was triggered, so now SL of second lot trailed just above previous low.

@DR, There is an observation on usdjpy 4hr chart, if you check on my uplaoded chart the 2 white vertical lines shows where the [histogram 1] pullback started and ended but in your uploaded usdjpy 4 hr chart the pullbacks is shorter [ in terms of numbers of bars] that can only means one thing, that the setting of HISTOGRAM 1 is wrong, either your setting or ours because i have the same chart with macheal msa in post 1,199 and wally1953 in post 1,188.

obviously, if setting is wrong tthe signal wouldnt be accurate.  please help to review HISOGRAM 1. thanks

We consider Gann 9 as our entry candle in every timeframe. Histogram 1 is representation of gann 9 of D1 in H4 chart.. D1 chart has 6 H4 candles. So histogram 1 is 9*6=54 and Histogram 2 is W1 Gann 9 on H4 meaning 9* 30= 270.

Wow tolani, you are fantastic !

A few days ago i realised that GANN HI LO ACTIVATOR was based on simple moving average. As our guppy settings are based on exponential moving averages, i had changed the code of all gann indicators from SMA to EMA, thinking that it might work better. Then i totally forgot about it till now when you pointed out the discrepency in the charts. Since i changed the code in all gann indicators, i am uploading fresh rar file in the first post as well with new templete named "GUPPY MTF HISTO EMA" to avoid any confusion.

Do the change improve results? Yes, I think so...

i am sorry and grateful to you for pointing out...

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
Josekawa!

I looked at your chart above and I looked at my same chart.

I'm speaking under correction here, but your reference to a reversal is incorrect. We are in an uptrend and it seems to me that this is a continuation not a reversal.

Any takers on this my forum friends?

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
Thanks for the comment Worsman. Yes, I understand that we are in an uptrend, maybe I didn't explain myself well.  I mean the price closed above the MA 51, the star symbol warning went off and both histograms turned green. So, do we consider this on the h1 chart as a continuation or reversal?

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
This is a perfect entry..

The first histogram represents H4 and the second represents D1. If you consider the full chart, D1 is in uptrend and H1 and H4 are in pullback.

The signal generated, TE 51 star and H4 histo lime suggest that in both timeframes the pullback is over. One more important thing is the Rsiomas are breaking out of  oversold zone adding confidence to go long.
Worsman is absolutely correct that that this is a continuation not a reversal. But if the histograms are removed from the chart your entry is a reversal entry on TE 51 signal.

This is the beauty in the system that H1 And H4 signals coincide perfrctly on one single candle indicating end of pullback and continuation of uptrend in both timeframes.

You are most welcome to share your trades....

Rsioma divergence is a one of the best entry, low risk and very very high reward. and entry candle precisely identified by the system .
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
I can't see the Gann lines

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
I deleted few indicators temporarily to highlight divergence

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
Anyone trading divergence, RSIOMA is the best indicator to trade divergences. 1) it is non repainting. 2) it is roboust: wont change direction frequently and suddenly with each candle like RSI . 3) RSIOMA divergence in over bought ( above 80) and over sold (below 20) are the best trend reversal trades.

Though RSIOMA in our system has no alerts, it plays a very important role in making entry decisions. Not only it precisely identifies the over bought and over sold zones but more importantly it also acts as a momentum indicator. Also it acts as a filter to trade entry.

To go long: if RSIOMA 8 is above 12, means the upward momentum is strong and it is a low risk high reward trade.

To go short : vise versa...
Trade rsioma divergence only if above criteria are met...

The rsioma divergence has to be supplimented with the alerts generated by the system. All indicators if complimenting eachother, only then an entry is validated.

Just a random example from my current chart.....

The entry is white vertical line where divergence is confirmed and a alert is generated in our system.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Lastly i dont want any one to ask or start coding rsioma divergence indicator as it not the core for the system but a part of it.

And ignore my trades at the bottom of the chart. They are my ongoing trades not related to this post

Dear friends.

Is there anyone who needs some help with this trading system from Dr. Rajesh? I think a good way would be if you publish your trading demo account in the Forex Factory trading explorer. So we could talk about failed trades and do better next time. I have my Trade Explorer. You can check it out, you can see that you can achieve good results with this trading system when used correctly.

Best regards

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
Hi Michel. I think what you propose is perfect, I will look into linking an account. I have also been reviewing your operations, I see that you have modified the strategy of this thread or so it seems to me, especially in the exits. Could you explain what modifications you made, the SLs are smaller (you do not execute the stops when the color changes, you varied the ratios) and the percentage of success is much higher than that of the Doctor. Congratulations on your results.

--- 帖子 #1288 ---
Hi RafaBy.

You observe very well. There is a simple explanation for this. It is not my intention to change anything in the trading strategy. Due to time constraints, I am forced to place pending orders in the evening by asia open, for the next day, to be ready when London open, and then New York. I pay attention to all entry signals, but only in the H4 chart.

My pending entry for a sell order is slightly below the last 4 hour candle. Then for my take profit I look at where the price could meet support, that will be my take profit level.

I have to do that in this way because I have no way of monitoring the open trades during the day on the computer. I can see my open trades only on my mobile phone, but without the indicators from Dr Rajesh.

I use the distance from the entry to the take profit as the distance for the stop loss. Unfortunately I have no other possibility.

My success rate is definitely not better than Dr Rajesh's success rate. I just started this account a few days ago. So I can still make a lot of mistakes. But the good thing about it, is that I can learn from it.

Most of the trades that ended in red for the doctor were initially well in the green; he often had no opportunity to observe his open trades due to time constraints, and so later they changed the color to red. I observed it sometimes.

On the other hand, I believe that the most important thing is to get the right entry correctly; everything else can be handled in the way that suits you best.

For example, I really get nervous when I see on my mobile phone that the trading price isn't moving properly, I just get out of the trade when it's in plus, before it goes in the opposite direction, that's why sometimes I don't reach the take profit. In the end this can be good or bad for me, but I prefer not to get in minus when the trading price moves very slonly.

If you have the time to follow your open trades on the computer, will it be better to do it exactly as explained in the instructions, that's definitely the best way to success.

I am happy to answer any further questions.

Kind regards

Lamentablemente, así es como funciona. Los traders están tan inundados por el bombardeo de información que no nos molestamos en aprender las estrategias correctamente y saltamos de una a otra. Así es como funciona.

Por mi parte, sigo pensando que la estrategia en sí que he aprendido de ti es excelente, los ratios obtenidos con ella son muy buenos. Llevo unos meses comparando las señales TP/SL de esta estrategia con otras míticas de forex factory como:

Comercio simplificado (TDI)
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ng-made-simple

Nihilistas

(https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...rex-indicators).

Solo poner esta estrategia encima de estos dos "debería estar orgulloso", independientemente de cómo funcione el hilo, en estos hilos, sobre todo al principio, el autor los mantiene, solo hay que leerlos para darse cuenta de ello.

Por otro lado, la estrategia que estoy usando y seguiré usando, veo que es de las mejores que he tenido en los últimos años, pero tiene mejoras como todo en la vida y estoy trabajando en ello.

Os dejo expuestos algunos de ellos por si queréis checarlos, desde mi punto de vista el GANN 9 en vez de marearos te llena el gráfico de lineas si sigues la estrategia a diario te marea y te da muchas señales falsas, en vez de esto para limpiar los gráficos y hacerlos más apetecibles a la vista he creado un "GANN PRESIGNAL" en un time frame superior. Un GANN de 50 marca la dirección del mercado en H4, las entradas son en esa dirección en un time frame inferior siempre y cuando el GANN superior no diga lo contrario.

He eliminado la primera ventana de la plantilla con sus dos indicadores porque las entradas siempre coinciden con los colores de estos, si te gustan los colores están muy bien, si te gusta la practicidad no sirven para nada o eso entiendo yo, siempre que hay una corrección a las medias 3,9,21 y 51 los colores coinciden con el movimiento inicial.

Lo único para lo que sirve el RSIOMA es para ver divergencias y por lo que tengo entendido de esta plantilla es una plantilla pura sangre si el mercado esta fuerte la señal no falla (Esto es lo que más me gusta de ella).

Los promedios que no aportan nada salvo la parte visual los he eliminado.

Bueno, hice algunos cambios más, en la parte visual pero no en la esencia, solo pretendo simplificar el trading y adaptarlo a mi. También adapté la estrategia a marcos temporales más pequeños M1_M5_M15, para operaciones intradía y scalping.

Por ultimo comentar, he leido en alguna parte de este hilo que no debiamos hacer cambios sobre esta plantilla inicial, disculpe si algun momento lo he molestado, lo que hice fue adaptarla a mi y simplificar la plantilla que no la estrategia pues en esencia como dije es de lo mejor que vi en los ultimos años, mi más sincera enhorabuena me ayudado mucho.Dejo unas imagenes para que vea como queda mi plantilla.

Disculpen mi inglés. Utilizo el traductor de Google.

"Lamentablemente, así es como funciona. Los traders están tan inundados por el bombardeo de información que no nos molestamos en aprender las estrategias correctamente y saltamos de una a otra. Así es como funciona."

True. i have been using Guppy system for many years now and very successfully Simply because of its ease to identify trends.

"Solo poner esta estrategia encima de estos dos "debería estar orgulloso", independientemente de cómo funcione el hilo, en estos hilos, sobre todo al principio, el autor los mantiene, solo hay que leerlos para darse cuenta de ello."

Every strategy has advantages and disadvantages. None will work in sideways market. The only important thing is to keep losses to minimum. In this system it is very easy to trail stoploss looking at the data window. The stoploss levels are always at dynamic support or resistance. one of the best method is to place initial SL at the fourth value in the data window and as the trade progresses' in your favor, move SL to 3rd,2nd and 1st values to minimize loss and maximize profits. TP is always according to traders greed. It is always good to exit trade when you feel that the profit earned is sufficient.

"Por otro lado, la estrategia que estoy usando y seguiré usando, veo que es de las mejores que he tenido en los últimos años, pero tiene mejoras como todo en la vida y estoy trabajando en ello."

Any suggestions and improvements are most welcome.

"Un GANN de 50 marca la dirección del mercado en H4, las entradas son en esa dirección en un time frame inferior siempre y cuando el GANN superior no diga lo contrario."

i cant agree more. i have also changed the setting Lb = 51 and take trades on PBC alerts in that direction.

"He eliminado la primera ventana de la plantilla con sus dos indicadores porque las entradas siempre coinciden con los colores de estos, si te gustan los colores están muy bien, si te gusta la practicidad no sirven para nada o eso entiendo yo, siempre que hay una corrección a las medias 3,9,21 y 51 los colores coinciden con el movimiento inicial."

The strategy can be stripped down to three moving averages 9,21,51 and one Rsioma 12 but it will require further analysis before entering the trade. With this chart i can spot entries in one second and need not think twice for trading without fear. Look at the chart below. All the flag entries after the yellow vertical line( weekly trend changed to bearish) and marked by rectangle..... easiest trades, minimum risk and huge reward. This will not be possible if you strip the chart naked.

"Lo único para lo que sirve el RSIOMA es para ver divergencias " "Los promedios que no aportan nada salvo la parte visual los he eliminado"

Here i disagree. I love RSIOMA indicator and i rarely use it for divergence (as i have used it today for my current trade).

RSIOMA is a very smooth and robust indicator. it wont change direction like RSI with every opposite candle. Also it indicates how much moment  is possible in the trend. A bullish RSIOMA below 50, i expect a strong up move. I also use it as a momentum indicator. 8 cross 12 from below above indicates a strong bullish trend and vise versa. In fact i don't trade unless 8 is above 12 for going long and vise versa.

"Bueno, hice algunos cambios más, en la parte visual pero no en la esencia, solo pretendo simplificar el trading y adaptarlo a mi. También adapté la estrategia a marcos temporales más pequeños M1_M5_M15, para operaciones intradía y scalping."

Change template as per your requirement and make profits. That is what the forum and this thread is for. A sincere request : please do not post your modified charts here. Some one will definitely ask for Template file and unnecessarily the thread will be flooded with files and templets causing confusion.

And yes the system works in all time frames.

Hi Michael, the price seeks liquidity in the markets and as a consequence it crosses or touches those support and resistance zones, as they are commonly called. In reality, what the price is doing is seeking its efficiency by reaching those zones. If you look closely, most of the time when it reaches those zones it breaks a maximum or minimum by just a few pips when the zone works. Entering these zones works better if there is a FAIR VALUE GAP beforehand, although what I am telling you has nothing to do with this thread. This has been studied for many years now and is now called smart money, but in the past it was called in many other ways. In the end, it is price action. It is all the same, whatever you call it, do not be fooled.

If you do not understand what I am saying, I recommend that you study "Smart money" it will help you understand price action.

Hi RafaBy

Thank you for the kind answer.

Let me explain why I asked. Unfortunately there have been no more posts about this excellent trading system from Dr. Rajesh for some time now. It is probably like already written: “Everything has been said and sufficiently explained”. It looks like that there is no further interest in making helpful contributions.

So I thought I would write a question to an active member of this thread about an interesting topic that should be basic knowledge for every active forex trader.

I already knew this answer, I read about it a time ago. I wanted to ensure that this valuable thread was continued with further contributions.

You are the second person who very kindly pointed out to me that my post had nothing to do with this thread, a friendly member had sent me a private message.

I had written another post with this topic, but then I immediately deleted it.

What one should do if there is nothing more to say?

Such a valuable thread from one of the best trading system ever should keep alive.

Kind regards

Hi Michael, I am really grateful for your contribution and concern to keep this thread alive !

There are no posts in the thread probably because i have been clear enough to discourage flooding of posts with indicators , templets , and EAs which may cause confusion among readers. Be assured i am receiving many personal messages thanking, encouraging and congratulating me for a good system. Most important is traders are making profit using the system.

All agree that the system has excellent entry signals but exit is a major issue as with all other systems and it is ususlly left to the psycology  of the trader. Sometimes we book profit too early and sometimes we take losses more than expected. I was working on a good exit strategy to compliment the system . That is the reason you might be seeing major losses in my trade explorer as i was testing live in demo account.

We are celebrating Diwali and tomorrow is "Lakshmi Pujan" that honours  Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, prosperity and fortune.

Tomorrow i will be introducing EXIT INDICATOR which i have compiled using ChatGPT. The results are quite encouraging. I hope it will make the system much better and more successful.

Hi Dr. Walveka, thank you for sharing this thread and your post.  I use a Guppy for my long term  portfolio.

I've done well.  I'm long only (only the SP500 or Nasdaq) and have built up my portfolio over the years.   I add a bit by bit relying only on H4 or sometimes the daily.

I get out when it goes against me and get back in when I see it go green.   I've been wrong a lot of times (missed profits) but long term this has been the only system that really works.

I hope to contribute to this thread.   A+ also that you are a cancer surgeon  Cancer research is one subject that is dear to my heart.  Enjoy your celebrations!

--- 帖子 #1314 ---
This is the exit/re-entry indicator I was talking about. I dont know who originally coded it, with due respect to him,I have grossly modified it using ChatGPT and renamed it to suit the system.

I have not tested it on live market but visual/manual backtest on charts looks promising.

A couple of things to consider before using this indicator.

1) When ever you feel you have made adequate/satisfactory profit, book it and exit the trade. Let the market do whatever it wants.

2) Trailing SL at the data window values is still a good option. The TE 21 value (Third value in data window) or TE 9 (second value in data window) during the initial phase of the trade ( to prevent stopping you out prematurely in a good trend) and TE 3 (first value in data window) when profits are better than expected is what i do during my trades.

3) I always trade with 2 lots and book profit of one lot at R:R 1:1. Then trail second lot to breakeven and above. I have been practicing this for many years with good results.

4) Always place SL in the system when trade is initiated.

5) Trading timeframes H1 and above is safer and more profitable in this system ( This is my personal opinion and i dont mean to hurt any one who is good at trading in lower timeframes) H4 is the best.

Always trade in demo account first, test the system and if you feel comfortable and confident only then trade in live market.

I also created (not modified ) two more indicators related to rsioma, using ChatGPT, in quest of good exit indicator. Though they might not serve for a good exit, still they might be useful to traders using rsioma in their strategy.

One draws arrows in subwindow when two rsioma cross ( not the standard rsioma and ma cross). this indicator has no alerts.

The Second draws vertical lines on change if slope and color of the rsioma line. this indicator is with alerts.

As far as i know, such such indicators do not exist.

To use them in our system just drag them into the rsioma window.

The cross serttings are 8 and 12 and the slope change is for Rsioma 12 which we use in our system. settings can be changed or modified.

Absolutely agreed. I am a long term investor . i choose 5 to 6 instruments per year usually in January using fundamental analysis of PE and ROCE using MAGIC formula sorting out only GROWTH stocks. i only buy stocks in uptrend using Guppy and when approximately at 10% profit i exit a part, approximately 75 % quantity and retain  the remaining 25% in my portfolio for ever. Again I buy the same script after a pullback is over and repet this cycle for 1 year. I always invest a fixed amount every time for all the stocks. I maintain a excel sheet of all my transactions meticulously so i know at any moment where i stand. I have color coded the excel sheet so at a glance i know what to buy or sell.

Guppy makes it very easy to make decisions and this system used in H4 or D1 is just what i need.

This is how my excel sheet is for today. this is inspite of indian market down by almost 10%

The order flow analysis in charts like GoCharting is much better to understand "Smart Money". The only data needed is Delta, Cumulitive Delta in real time. It is wonderful if combined with Guppy system even for scalping in 1,3,5 min charts. For long term it is phenomenal.

I am using GoCharting for last 2 years and will be happy to share my method. but not on this thread please.

Hello walvekarraje. I don't know the Gocharting platform in depth, I've never used deltas combined with GUPPYS, I think it's a very interesting and intelligent idea, apparently you've already developed a system. I would be very interested in following it and supporting you to the extent of my knowledge. If you decide to open another thread with this other system you can count on my full support.

Regards.

--- 帖子 #1321 ---
I did a visual backtesting for a few years and I was really surprised at how reliable this indicator is in relation to your strategy teachings. It does what you say. This indicator is really good. Thanks again for your effort. Congratulations.

I'm sorry. That template was the content of a concern that has nothing to do with this thread.

It was a mistake to post this chart, unfortunately I couldn't undo that.

Please excuse me.

Hi Rajesh. First of all, thank you for the new exit indicator.

Secondly, I may be asking the obvious, but, I really want to improve on placing the Trailing SL. Whenever you get a moment, can you please share a screenshot of your Data Window and highlight the three values you are referring to as good SL options? Thank you.

1. The TE 21 value (third value in data window)

2. TE 9 (second value in data window)

3. TE 3 (first value in data window)

--- 帖子 #1325 ---
Dear Doc,

Regarding the above two indicators; I note that when I'm in a Sell trade and the alert comes in to warn/consider that I exit the trade it mentions the opposite direction(not the direction that I'm in) does that mean that there's a change to the opposite direction for me to consider taking?

I just need to get a clear understanding of this.

Thanks again for your great input since the start of the thread.

--- 帖子 #1326 ---
You are speaking about the RAJESH GUPPY EXIT.ex4 indicator.

This is the one which deaws Histogram:  LIme above 0 level and Magenta below 0 level.

When all the histogram is printing Lime lines and the last line is magenta at the close of the candle,  the indicator will alert "Consider Exit Long OR Re-enter Short ". This means that if you are long you should consider exiting long position. But if the trend is bearish and you are not in trade then you can consider entering a short position.

This indicator is to be used as a Exit indicator or a reentry indicator depending on the Guppy trend. This indicator does not indicate reversal of trend.

--- 帖子 #1327 ---
Hello doctor. Thank you very much for your help. Could you please share all indicators and template of your latest settings

--- 帖子 #1328 ---
Sure.

There is no change in the settings except gann vertical lines at Lb 51. Trade in direction of these lines.

There are few improvements:

-- Exit indicator added. it is the bottom histogram in the chart. alerts enabled.

-- the other histogram color width increased so it will be easy to read the change in exit indicator.

-- All alerts modified so that the understanding of what is happening on chart is greatly improved.

Few important tips/guidelines to be stressed at this point of time:

Our basis of trade is to follow the trend.

--Guppy decides the trend.

--Reversal or change in trend is indicated by TE 51 (" TE 51 TREND REVERSED ") alert ( indicated by star in circle on chart ) OR Rajesh swghl current alert ("CURRENT TF TREND REVERSAL") alert ( indicated by vertical dotted line on chart). Both will be always on the same candle. this is done purposefully by me to stress on reversal of trend. Fake breakouts and breakdowns are possible so it is important to monitor the trade.

--Do not trade reversal trades based on PBC alerts or Rajesh Exit alerts. these alerts indicate loss of momentum in the current trend and do not indicate reversals.

-- H4 is my preffered and recommended timeframe.

Lastly trade in demo account, get used to the system.

False breaks are killing me. What can we do to avoid them? If this can be solved then we have a very good system.

--- 帖子 #1332 ---
Hello Maxus182. It cannot be solved with physical means (template), if you do not have to apply mental means (knowledge in the system). You have to be very patient with the current market where there is no clear direction (do not enter). From my point of view you have to be very selective in addition to applying the rules of the strategy you have to wait for the second histogram to be aligned, that is, that the trend in operating time is in momentum, plus higher time frames aligned. If you do it this way you will carry out fewer operations with a higher percentage of success (more signal quality) you will avoid that in the moments of DD the system generates doubts, all systems go through this situation, trading with another trend system will not improve your trading, only your experience will improve it.

It is not a problem with the system but with how it is applied, in easy markets the system does not fail, in markets like the current one the experience in the system is everything.

This is what I mean by being patient. Enter in the direction of the 2nd histogram H4 (SELL on H1) ignore the 1st histogram on H1.

--- 帖子 #1333 ---
Guppy is a trend trading system and not meant to trade breakouts and reversals. Pullback continuation pattern (PBC) is the method for entering traades in the direction of the trend.

let us see the same EURUSD chart and there are multiple possible entry candles to take a short trade.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The basic principle is to enter trade only when all indicators are of same color.(Red/Magenta for short and blue/lime for long)

The vertical magenta dotted line is where the bearish trend has started on H4 and the vertical lime line is where the the trend has ended.

After the magenta line the bias should be to take only sell trades.

The red vertical line is where the trend has turned bearish on weekly timeframe.Here there will be alert and message " W1 TREND REVERSAL ON H4 Sell " This is the first short sell trade.

Even if this trade is missed, watch the APB candle color. Notice the small lime color APB candles.. these are tiny pullbacks and a short entry is possible after the close of next magenta APB candle.

Similarly notice the flags created by guppy lime color lines. This is a pullback. The end of this pullback will  "PBC PATTERN sell  " alert and yellow circle above the candle on the chart. These are also valid short entry candles.

The yellow Guppy line which i have stressed is the TE 21 line. This is represented by the third value in data window. I use this value to place my initial SL when i enter the trade. I trade 2 lots. The target of first lot is = My SL . This is R:R 1:1...When first target is acheived, I trail my SL for the second lot at TE 9 and finally at TE 3. These are the second and first values respectively in the data window.

I never trade pullbacks or breakouts.

I trade only H4 charts and for me these are the easiest method to trade the markets.

--- 帖子 #1334 ---
Finally notice the RSIOMA making higher high..
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When the first higher high is printed, it signifies that the trend is losing momentum even though the weekly histo is bearish.This is where you should move to another chart or other trading opportunity.

At the end of the chart the RSIOMA has made a lower high signifying that the bearish momentum is resumed.

Trading LTF with Guppy and APB :

1)   To understand this trading system please read Guppy document and APB documents first.

2)   It is advisable to know at least few basics of trend trading like Dow Theory. Trend lines, flags and channel breakouts. These will supplement and or confirm entries taken using this system.

3)   GUPPY APB is a trend trading system. Wait for the trade to manifest itself. Wait for candle to close. All entries are at the close of the candle. Alerts are also at the close of the candle but you can change to open candle if you want. I do not recommend it.  Do not trade very big candles or candles with large wicks.

4)   The entry candle should be at par with the previous candle visually in current timeframe, not too big, not too small.

5)   No counter trend entries are recommended. Always trade in the direction of Long term Guppies. Dow Theory is only to enter in direction of trend and avoid counter trend entries.

6)   This is not Holy Grail. There will always be winning and losing trades. The aim is to keep losses at minimum and ride the trend as long as possible.

7)   RTE 21 is a HARD STOPLOSS. So the risk is predefined before entering the trade. According to money management if the risk is greater than the max allowed, do not trade, or keep SL as per your money management protocol.

8)   As it is a trend trading system, the R:R is 1:2. I always recommend trading with 2 lots. TP of one lot is with R:R 1:2 with pre defined initial SL at RTE 21. Shift to BE or trail SL to RTE 6 value when TP 1 is achieved for the second lot.

DO NOT :

1) Add or delete indicators from the template or try to strip down the system to minimum indicators. This is a visual trend trading system easy to understand and follow.

2) You can add indicators or remove them but do not post pics on the thread. It will confuse others.

3) Do not ask for Dashboard with alerts. I will post a screener/dashboard in my own time and explain how to use it.

4) Do not ask if the system is available on any other platforms like MT5 or trading view. I use MT4 only. All the settings are in the template. Design/replicate the system in other platforms.

5) DO NOT ask for EXPERT ADVISOR or AUTOMATED TRADING USING THIS SYSTEM. Because I know it can’t be done.

6) I am a long term investor in Indian market in equities. I do not trade forex. In forex I trade in demo account only in my free time. But this system I do use in futures and options in Indian market whenever I get a good opportunity on M30 chart. I usually sell options for passive income. So please don’t ask me what pairs I trade and which sessions I trade.

Lastly:

1)   These are recommendations, not rules.

2)   Understand and study the system, get used to it, trade in Demo account first. When confident trade in real account.

3)   This is to be used on 30 min TF. It can be used on M15 or H1.I don’t recommend below M30. H4 and above are already discussed.

Thanks Dr.Rajesh,thanks for your detailed explanation. just for clarity how do you use the rajesh SWGHL cuurent in this new LTF system or it is to be used as earlier editions. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #1358 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In the above chart, when the candle closes below the RTE 51 (1) line, an alert " GUPPY 51 TREND REVERSED " will be generated and  SWGHL magenta vertical dotted line will be drawn. Athe LONG TERM GUPPIES (2) are already bearish. a short trade at the close of such a candle is justified. SWGHL lines represent the short term GUPPY TREND CHANGE. At this point as the ST guppies are not clearly visible on chart in live market, vertical lines make it possible to understand this trend change.

A second short entry also becomes a possibility when ST guppies are clearly visible on chart and a pullback as mentioned in the guidelines.

Look at this chart. even though there is a buy signal on both long (white arrow)  and short term guppies (lime vertical line), there is no clear trend visible.. Avoid such charts.

On the other hand, this chart  you can  see a nice uptrend with a clear pullback. it will be worth to wait for PBC buy alert and a bullish APB candle to close to go long.

Short entry, SL, TP1...

Long Trem guppies evenly alighned without compression indicating a steady established down trend.

Note that short term guppies not clearly seen on chart but SWGHL magenta line defines the short term trend change in the direction of Long term guppies..

Lets see how the trade progresses..

--- 帖子 #1362 ---
Hello. Why didn't you set the TP longer?

--- 帖子 #1363 ---
TP1 = initial SL

TP2 trails

--- 帖子 #1364 ---
This is a right question. In guidelines I have clearly mentioned TP 1 = R:R 1 :2

Answer is 1) I knew i will not be able to monitor the trade due to my working hours. So keeping TP 1 at R:R 1:1 , my intension was to book one profit so that at least my trade does not go into a loss with second lot also R:R 1:1 . Unfortunately TP 1 was never hit and both lots hit SL.

This is the problem of trading LTF... 1) you need to be in front of the monitor all the time. 2) Fear and Greed will take you out of the trade in a loss or minimum profit.

Any way, This system concentrates on the Entry and initial SL after entry. And as always there are no rules but only Guidelines. Executing and monitoring the trade is indivisual perspective.

Would like to start off and say Thank you for sharing this strategy! Ive downloaded everything and added it to a demo account to mess around with. 2 problems.

1. When i download the latest indicators and template, everything is installed into the respective folders. I load the template and its a pitch black screen lol. Any thoughts?

2. Can i PLEASE enquire into your color pattern and colors. Are they custom? if so, would you share the numbers? Just cause your chart is so apealing on the eye. Kind of sick of the color scheme I have and i cant seem to mimic yours. Ive messed around with greens and pinks/purples but just cant get it right. Yours is electric if i might say.

Again, thank you, if you dont feel like sharing your colors thats cool too B)

As expected EJ is in pullback. Trailing SL hit but on M30 price inside short term guppies. Long trade possible as per our strategy.

Holding on to UJ with SL and TP in place. Will let it run its own course as it is a risk free trade.

we are waiting impatiently

The system definitely works best on stocks, on D1, H4 and H1. It can also be done intraday on M15. Here are some active entries on H4.

I risk 0.50% of the account per operation, the closings are first R1, I partially close and protect BE, the rest of the lot R10 with trailing to the average 51 or 21 as I see it. There are operations that can last more than 30 days. Quiet and reliable trading.

--- 帖子 #1406 ---
Can you go into more detail? please write down

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
The details are already explained in this thread. Mr. Walvekarraje's strategy applied to CFDs on shares or pure shares is more profitable than applied to currencies or commodities. Shares are more trend-oriented, "this system is trend-oriented."

If we choose trend-oriented products and apply good money management, it is difficult to lose.

Will try to post few live trades from next week for better understanding of the system.

--- 帖子 #1415 ---
Thank you Doctor Rajesh for your commitment and dedication to help us succeed in this game. Thank you for continuing to finetune and improve this system to make it idiotproof.

I for one, am very grateful for your generosity in sharing this system.

God Bless you in everything you do.

--- 帖子 #1416 ---
Thank you for your kind words !

A short recap... the basic is the same as discussed in this thread. I always trade with 2 lots. TP 1 = SL. Once TP 1 is hit, SL of second lot to BE. This makes the trade risk free and then take advantage of the trend as long as possible,

--- 帖子 #1417 ---
One more surprise for you guys. There is a MTF version which i have not included. That is what i am using now. I am waiting for two things..

1)You all should get used to this version. Trade in demo accounto first. Post live charts using this templete.

2) Waiting for the dashboard to get working. Master MwlRCT is helping generously for the same. his latest version looks very promising which i am testing now. A working dashboard may make a great diffrence and we all can be on the same page ( I suppose ).

You have taught many of us here something much more virtuous than making us earn money. and that is to do good for nothing. believe me, I remember your sacrifice every day in my daily life and think about how I can adapt it to my life. Knowing that there are people like you, even if it is a little, is a very powerful reason to make this world livable despite everything.

--- 帖子 #1421 ---
Thank you very much, Mr. Walvekar. Greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1422 ---
Your message truly touched me. Knowing that my efforts go beyond trading and inspire others in a meaningful way is the greatest reward. We all have the power to make the world a little better, and I'm grateful to be part of a community that values kindness and selflessness. Thank you for your kind words—they mean more than you know!

Hi.

New to this thread, been lurking for a while and thinking to give it a try for this system.

I want too thank walvekarraje for your hard work and good will to share this with all of us.

Time is not my friend, but I will try to contribute as much as possible.

So, here is my first entry, let's see how it will end:

Welcome and best of luck .

Your chart clearly shows lower high and higher low. Look at my previous three charts. there is clear HH,HL or LH,LL pattern.

This can be a profitable trade but one i will avoid.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Be assured till all APB candles are lime

Suggestion is: when price reaches the trendline, shift your SL to BE.

I can be wrong but this is just a suggestion.

I am happy to have been proved wrong.

Hello Doc

Would you please add more filter lines like your above final posted image.

--- 帖子 #1433 ---
Yes. That is the MTF version a was talking about.

It helps to trade H4 on M30 and H1 and also filter trade entries. I just wanted you guys to get used to this version first.

Dashboard not working properly. still.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

GU entry with  help of dashboard.

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
Thanks for ur work. Im looking at this crazy gains and wonder how much u risking per trade? No way its 1% risk

--- 帖子 #1438 ---
I keep initial SL at RTE 21 or RTE 50 but as the trade progresses in my direction I shift SL to BE. As i trade H4 it gives me enough time to reevaluate the trade. As  it is a trend trading system and i take continuation trades only the chances of loss is minimal. Once in profit the risk becomes  Zero.

This is a demo account.

In my real account Indian market hours and my working hours are same, so i do not get time to keep watch on the screen. So i usually sell options on H4 so that the  time decay works in my favour and need to observe the chart is minimal. Once in profit I need to just wait for the option to zero. But that happens only at expiry. I dont wait that long. I book profit when the price falls to 70% of my selling price. Indian market is only 6 hrs 15 min so trend goes in my direction on day 1 and 2, it becomes apassive trade and i just wait for target to hit.

I use the demo account to get used to the charts, precise entries, modify and upgrade the alerts and define targets.

Whats entry type on usd/jpy trade? Since its downtrend but you opened long position?

--- 帖子 #1441 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1) It was in downtrend forming lower highs and lower lows.

The entry candle has clearly broken the previous two lower highs and closed beyond that. Indicating Change Of Character.

2) The vertical lime dotted line printed on chart is RTE 51 signal indicating start of uptrend.

3) After the vertical line there was a small pullback just below RTE 6 (Yellow  dot) Immediately followed by entry candle which closed above RTE 6 (white dot). Also the subwindow lines changed from magenta to lime indicating continuation pattern.

4)All the guppies on chart are lime indicating Uptrend.

Hence the Long Entry.

My entry candle is a large candle as compared to others, So my SL is at the low of the same candle.

If the trend continues up, I expect this low to be defended.

Also as long as the APB candles are lime, I will stay in the trade.

What expiration time do you use to perform this operation?

Hello guys.

I have a question.

Do the indicators, templates, and other files pertaining to the system that are shared on the first page/post the updated ones? Or you use another set/settings of the files now?

Thank you for your generous help and contribution. I would like to request for MTF version of your final template

I can't thank you enough Dr Walvekarraje. You have given us a very powerful tool. Could you, please, include Notification alert in RAJESH SWGHL CURRENT in your next update? Thanks.

\

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
Alerts for RAJESH SWGHL CURRENT are already present in the system.  "RTE 51 TREND REVERSED" alert will be diaplayed at the close of the candle when the dotted vertical line is printed on chart.

--- 帖子 #1448 ---
Off course I will. Get used to this version first and let me know the results.

--- 帖子 #1449 ---
Hi walvekarraje, great update with the latest version! What indicator creates this vertical dotted lines, I'd like to change the colors, but can't figure out how to do it?

Thank you once again for your work!

--- 帖子 #1450 ---
This is the indicator that prints vertical dotted lines.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I have modified this using CHATGPT so there is no input to change colors in the indicator settings.But i have shared the mql4 file somewhere in my posts so you can modify as per your need. if you cant do it let me know.

--- 帖子 #1451 ---
Hyy brother i am taking entries only when the dotted lines and the arrow appears on the same candle on h4, started testing on demo considering candle low as sl and 1:2 rr lets se how it goes, i feel we all should do testing with different combinations as we'll come to a conclusion early, really appreciate your work Dr, im from karnataka btw

--- 帖子 #1452 ---
What you are talking about is trend reversal entry with a combination where RTE 51 and RTE 21 alerts appear on the same candle. This is already defined in Type 1 entry in my guidelines. Out of the three entry types I have defined you are practicing only one subtype of Entry 1. This is a good practice to follow one single strategy and perfect it.

"i feel we all should do testing with different combinations as we'll come to a conclusion early". This I dont agree. I have spent a lot of time to properly define the system and prepare the guidelines.All the permutations and combinations for a low risk high reward trade are already defined. I have already done the Thinking part. What you have to do is only the Learning part.

I dont mean to discourage you but i will suggest you read and understand the system and the guidelines properly, practice in demo account, perfect it before taking live trades.

"Plan the Trade and then Trade the Plan"

--- 帖子 #1453 ---
Mr  MwlRCT has very kindly helped to modify the dashboard to our requirements and it is working perfectly. I am working on the best possible settings for the dashbaord and will share them when i feel confident because there are a number odf ways to use the dashboard.

Till then any feedbacks on dashboard are welcome.

Hi. It is possible to do an Expert Advisor from this strategy? Regards!

--- 帖子 #1455 ---
If you can define entry, exit, stoploss, trailing stoploss, take profit, breakeven, re-entry for all the three types of entries i have in the guidelines...And a coder to do all this ....Yes.... then it is possible.

Attach this indicator on your chart with Lb=6 Check if the Dn/Up printed on dashboard is correct according to thr price in relation to the SWGHL line.

The dashboard signals and alerts are only at the close of the candle. The Dn printed will change to Up and alert will be generated at the close of the candle and not on open candle.

--- 帖子 #1458 ---
Does this file here belong to the final installation? Sorry, I don't understand. I thought they hadn't shared the final installation yet

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
You are not welcome here.

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
It is a part of the system since day one.

--- 帖子 #1461 ---
WELL  DONE  DOCTOR!!!
your strategy really rocks

--- 帖子 #1462 ---
I Really really like the idea of getting the alert when candle breaks,so i attached this Gann scanner LB 1.08 on LB 6 as suggested by raje,but still it doesnt give the correct alert,what am i doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #1463 ---
your chart shows open candle. you need to wait for the candle to close, a new candle to form and then only will the Dn will change to Up and an alert will be displayed. This is a problem with the dashboard. trying to correct it.

--- 帖子 #1464 ---
any progress in this thread or indicator?

--- 帖子 #1465 ---
Sure. but is any of you using this system?

--- 帖子 #1466 ---
Dear　walvekarraje

I am following and studying your system.

It is the nicest approach I have ever experienced.

I appreciate your efforts. I would be happy to receive updates.

Best regards
