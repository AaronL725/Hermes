anyone here used TD T'L's? they are over 70% (closer to 90) accurate with breakouts. using TD TL can profit on all timeframes down to 15M. scalpers and long term traders can profit from this. Also, u might not wait on a break of a TL but can trade its bounce i.e: the price is bouncing inside a triangle drawn by TD TL. here is a picture of the bounces: http://i11.tinypic.com/47mb0ar.gif and here is a picture of a breakout: http://i16.tinypic.com/29dy9mt.gif notice how the last bar before breakout closed higher (breakout qualifier) here are the breakout qualifiers: Upside breakout qualifiers Qualifier 1: The price bar prior to an upside breakout must be a down close. Qualifier 2: The current price bar’s open must be greater than both the current TD Supply Line and the previous price bar’s close and must then trade at least one tick higher. Qualifier 3: The previous price bar’s close plus the previous bar’s “buying pressure” must be below the current price bar’s TD Supply Line price level. Qualifier 4: The current price bar’s open must be above both the previous two price bars’ closes, and the current price bar’s TD Supply Line must be above the previous price bar’s high. Downside breakout qualifiers Qualifier 1: The price bar prior to a downside breakout must be an up close. Qualifier 2: The current price bar’s open must be less than both the current TD Demand Line and the previous price bar’s close and must then trade at least one tick lower. Qualifier 3: The previous price close minus the previous bar’s “selling pressure” must be above the current price bar’s TD Demand Line price level. Qualifier 4: The current price bar’s open must be below both the previous two price bars’ closes, and the current price bar’s TD Demand Line must be below the previous price bar’s low. TD TL Indicator

one thing i must say, the method is most profitable the higher the timeframe. i use it on H15 but i really want to use it on H1 and greater cuz 15m is well...more market noise than H1. with TD TL, u risk very little trading TL bounces. in fact risking 10 pips is not uncommon for me for a TP of about 20 pips + spread. pairs i watch (ranked): usdjpy gbpusd eurusd usdchf eurjpy gbpchf gbpjpy only on large TF as spread is a whopping 12 pips for me.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Very interesting thing you got here, so once price reaches some of these TD lines then there are a few options I think: trade the bounce, the breakout, or do nothing

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi Mr., nice thread and very interesting topic. I am not an expert in DeMark, as you will be able to tell from my next question: What are the horizontal trend lines in the indicator? Are they support and resistance lines? What is the criteria used to draw them? I understand how the TL's are drwan, but would like some light around these horizontal ones. On the other hand, it may be helpful if you post a chart explaining your system. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
In your chart what does the "ShowingSteps=1" &amp; "BackSteps=0" relate to?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
that's a daily trend line, look how on friday price hit 1.9865 and bounce off the line ... funny thing is a 50% fibo too. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I like Tom Demark trend lines and use them everyday in trading. Below is a simple method of trading using his method on the 4HR chart.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
the Horizontal lines are calculated using TD's formulas (dont have the formulas now) the horizontal lines are where the Take profit is best placed once TL are breached. U can scale out profits as u go along. As for MT4 users who cant do this, i normally scale out using opposite trades. example: sell 3 lots of gbpusd. TP @ 1.9900, price is 1.9950. how to scale this out? place a buy limit of 1 lot 10 pips below the entry, 1.9940. with stop loss @ 3 lots TP of 1.9900 place another 1 lot 20 pips below @ 9930 with SL at same 1.9900. this way u lock in profit as u go along even if u are not there. Also, once the original TP is hit, the two buy limits would be closed too.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
it's not funny to me. It is rather Thrilling when these things happen.. i.e: indicator convergences

--- 帖子 #10 ---
showsteps shows trendlines of the past. backsteps is to allow lagging. I dont use backsteps. ----------------- ps, the indicator was not written by me,

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I thought that the points of the trendlines were supposed to be the highest/lowest candle within 2 candles to the left and right side of it. The indicator draws them differently, however. I'm confused on how to draw these trendlines. Could you please elaborate?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
are you sure? remember trendlines are drawn from right to left and remember lower trendlines ALWAYS tilt upwards and upper TL always tilt downwards a lower TL is drawn from the low of the right to a LOWER low to the left

--- 帖子 #13 ---
like this. Notice the red highs and blue lows.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I think that pure DeMarkism would disqualify the red trend line you have drawn. It is violated by the high of the bar following the last fractal that it is drawn to. I can't quote chapter and verse of DeMark's book that says that, but its in there somewhere. If I get a chance, I'll try to find it.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
ok please find it

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Please refer to page 37 chapter one s &amp; P 500 left side of chart A X B ( between A and X ) Demark gives an example of a demand line drawn in the way Mr Demark as drawn his. I have searched the entire chapter on supply and demand trend lines and cannot find this restriction. And again on page 41 and again on page 47

--- 帖子 #17 ---
billbss, thanks for the concern but i think the TL is ok

--- 帖子 #18 ---
hey mr jones, what is the tile of that book? should be on amozon right

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Yes, it is cheap and is called ( from $34.83 used) The New Science Of Technical Analysis

--- 帖子 #20 ---
oh i think he meant this chart http://i11.tinypic.com/47mb0ar.gif that is indeed an error

--- 帖子 #21 ---
This is an example of a level 1 TDTL, could you explain the error?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
i'm not quite sure if the low on the left is really a low (2 to the left, two to the right)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Can anyone tell me where to get the english version of the indicator that Mr Demark provided? When I attach this indicator to a chart it shows the UTD's &amp; LTD's and then there is just a bunch of confusing code.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
That would be a level 2 TDTL.. This indeed would be an error for a level 2, but not for a level 1

--- 帖子 #25 ---
thnx

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Here's a PDF from Currency Trader that gives an indepth explanation for TD Lines For Level 1 (Supply Line) - starting from the last closed candle/bar, nearest current price, select the nearest candle/bar that has 1 lower high to the left and 1 lower high to the right of the selected candle/bar. Then move to the left to find the next instance of the same pattern. Reverse the procedure for the Demand Line, but always drawing TD Lines from right to left. For Level 2 (Supply Line) - starting from the last closed candle/bar, nearest current price, select the nearest candle/bar that has 2 lower highs to the left and 2 lower highs to the right of the selected candle/bar. Then move to the left to find the next instance of the same pattern. Reverse the procedure for the Demand Line, but always drawing TD Lines from right to left. Hope this helps, there is other stuff in the Mouteki threads that can aid anyone new to this. He used 4hr charts for his methodology.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I think you're referring to pg 15, middle paragraph (see fig 1.9) in which he says if the CLOSE immediately following a pivot is above or below the trendline, the TL is not invalid, but suspect. In the chart above, the high does break the TL, but it's not a close. I just got the book last week. It's interesting and I think it'll help with timing issues.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks for that info, I see what you mean... thereby reducing the frequency of TDTLs and an example of that would be on page 18

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I have version 3.1 in English:

--- 帖子 #30 ---
You're right. That's exactly what I was thinking of- the close not the high. My mistake. I should have double checked before I wrote anything.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks Banzai...exactly what I was looking for...I just had not found it yet!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Mr. Demark On the qualifiers do all 4 need to be met or any one of them?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
any one of the 4 qualifiers would work

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I like the way this one draws trendlines best. it dosent mess with the forming candle. It also has a alarm

--- 帖子 #35 ---
You seem to have found an indicator and not really bothered to understand the theory behind DeMark's trend lines. It would pay you to buy a copy of his book and read it. I have seen a few try to trade using DeMark without understanding what it actually means and blow their accounts. Also I always thought it was illegal to post copyright material? without the expressed consent of the owner. //| Ind-TD-DeMark-3.mq4 | //| Copyright 2005, Kara Software Corp. Mark

Hi Demark great job and nice thread i,m new for Demark trend line but i noticed that my demark indicator is diffrent from yours !! whos better could u explain wht is the information on the left of the chart Level,BREAK QUALFICTOR,false,source I use 4 Hr should i enter postion when the candle break the trendline or i should waite till the 4hr candle close above the trend in buy(red trend) and below it in sell(dark blue trend) regards

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thank you very much for taking time to post this information. The accuracy figures are very interesting. Is this from back testing data? Can anyone explain the difference between Mouteki and TDMTL ( I know TDM invented these but I mean implementation differences) thanks again :-)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
From my limited experience in both, one of the major differences is the qualifications for entering a position after the line is broken. If I'm not mistaken, in Mouteki, you only enter on a bar open outside the trend line. However, there are four qualifiers that will allow entry in TD's system. It's possible to enter on a break only, not a close outside, provided certain criteria are met. Actually, it's also possible using TD's method for a bar to open outside the trendline, and provided it doesn't tick further but goes back, this is not considered a valid break. So there are more intricacies with TD's method.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Okay, question. I'm looking in TD's "Day Trading" book, and I realize that the four qualifiers are qualifiers for intraday (i.e., pre-bar-close) breakout entries. He then says this (p. 222): So, let's say none of the four qualifiers were met to enter on a break down of a TD Demand line, but the bar closes below the line. The new bar opens. What happens? Do I open a position? It doesn't sound like it, from the above quote. It sounds almost like I should be reversing the other way. But when I do reverse? And if I do indeed open a breakout position, should I open on the next bar open (after the failed non-qualified intraday break)? If so, where does Demark say this?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Ok sorry, I have to bump this, because this is a really important aspect of TD Line qualified breakouts... Notice the attached chart. The breakout bar was clearly not a qualified breakout, hence we would have faded and gone long there, or not entered at all. However, price continued to drop. Is this simply a case where TD Lines failed? I realize this will happen probably half the time, so it's okay if that's the case. But again, none of the intraday qualifiers were met. Does this mean it's okay to open a short position on the next bar (not an "intrabar entry," an entry on the OPEN of the bar), or should I consider the break disqualified and do nothing? The whole thing that confuses me is that Demark calls these "intraday" qualifiers. Does that mean that after the bar closes below a demand line, or above a supply line, that we are allowed to open then? That's my whole question.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
A question for anyone who has "Market Timing"--page 163, Figure 4.1 -- can anyone tell me why there is no TD Line drawn between the lows of Feb 9 (the level 1 line) and Jan 22 (the level 3 line)? It would seem that after the close on Feb 10, the Feb 9 point would have been established, and at that point the lower TD Point to the left of Feb 9 would have been the Jan 22 low. Then, on Feb 12, the big down bar (the level 12 point) would have been a qualified breakout (qualifiers 1 and 3) to the downside. Of course, then it would have hugely failed as the next big bullish bar would have taken out any stops. Anyone with this book, can you verify my logic, or tell me why I'm wrong?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Better late then never, I guess? The reason a TD Demand line wasn't drawn on those dates is: In DeMark on Daytrading Options (might also be in his other 2 books, found it easier in this one though) he says "If the previous TD Demand line was exceeded to the downside ( on qualified basis ) the TD Line remains on the chart and a new TD Demand is added; if the previous line was not exceeded, the TD Demand Line is simply redrawn. Also the chart you posted previously was a qualified breakout by using the #4 qualifier = Open less than previous 2 bars closes and TD Demand is below previous bar's low. When it comes to Tom DeMark's techniques, he really get you .

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hammm Excellent trading style i like it just because im also a technical trader and like to use 4-Hour chart with the help of All kind of trendlines , Channels , PP and some time Support &amp; Resistance Also You got the Good Stuff Man!!! Carry On

--- 帖子 #44 ---
hi hany I have been looking at your demark indicator and its pretty good actually... Im going to observe it for a while to see what all the notes on the top left mean. Was there a manual or an explanation with this indicator? thanks

--- 帖子 #45 ---
that post is over 15 months old, and so is this thread. It's dead! Hany's still around but he's on other threads now.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
So noone uses Demark anymore ? best regards

--- 帖子 #47 ---
wow I didnt realise the dates bugger.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yes I do use DeMark TD Trendlines. "DeMark" is a person and he has developed multiple trade techniques besides TD Trendlines. I use many of these such as his most well known TD Sequential. If you have a particular question ask away. Otherwise he has written 3 different books so if you really want to learn to trade using TD T/Lines or any of his other techniques comprehensively, I would suggest you pick up one of his books on Amazon or elsewhere.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Suntrader that is my little problem i need to clear things out i have started reading in The New Science Of Technical Analysis but i dont understand some of it and now i need to ask someone that does understand it what the book means Maby you can help me ? best regards

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Yes go right ahead, what is your question(s)?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Weel it is several i think but i start with one. How do i come up with X in when i shall calculate the Z? in the price projection best regards

--- 帖子 #52 ---
OK, here is a chart of UJ 4hour. The green TD trendline was not qualified so you can disregard it. The red TD trendline was since the breakout (at point C) there was a down close on the bar before the break. To project possible targets you take the lowest low below the trendline (point A) , in this case since move is up, and subtract from the point immediately above on the trendline (point B) which would be 101.397 - 97.893 then this is added to breakout point at C or 101.00 It turns out the full target 100% came up short, 50% was the way to go. Half a loaf is better than none. Note also on bottom of chart (point A) was a TD Sequential buy signal which kind of reinforces trendline break. HTH

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thank You Suntrader i shall read up some and come back. What do you think of Sequential what i have seen so far in metatrader im no so impressed, but i have not read about it yet. Also what of Demarks science do you prefer to use in you trading ? best regards

--- 帖子 #54 ---
The one I use the most is (a locked version of) TD Sequential that I bought years ago directly from Tom DeMark's company. Many other freely-available versions on the net are not correct in all aspects. There are many other studies of his I use that are too numerous to list.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
ok how do i count manually ? the first step is to identify a close higher than the 4 closes before after that i dont now ? for a long best regards

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Actually no, first a "price flip" has to happen. Close greater than 4 bars ago and then a close less than 4 bars ago (for a buy setup). The whole system what to look for is a little involved so I did a search here on Forex Factory and found a link to a PDF: http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...4&amp;d=1160532908 I haven't checked it but assume it is correct. Otherwise I learned how by reading DeMark's books. Going to the source works best.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Oboy this is even harder than i first thout for me to grasp. Do you think this tool is good does it have a high win rate ? and if so can i buy an indicator from demark to my mt4 do you think ? or are you using something better like the d-wave for example ? Thanks you Suntrader for leading me in the right direction best regards

--- 帖子 #58 ---
There are Tom DeMark indicators for MT, maybe here on FF - I don't know since I use TradeStation. Do a forum search, google it and I believe there is some MT user website somewhere which I am sure has TD Sequential since it is the most well know of TD's indicators. To do it by eye is too cumbersome. I have never systemized it (beyond my coding skill level) so I really couldn't tell a win rate. It works on all time frames and markets successfully. As far as D-Wave, yes I use it although on daily charts or higher. GT

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Here are 3 de mark indicators They all do the same thing only the presentation is different. I use demark trend lines in my trading when going with the trend and I think it works great on all time frames.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks Suntrader i have find some counting indicators but the repaint and that is not so sexy. dfxclub thanks for the indicators i have a look at them maybe you will describe you trading strategy little more some day ? And how to use this indicators, what to buy on and so ? best regards

--- 帖子 #61 ---
dfxclub, on the bold text above. Is that trend different than DeMark trend? TIA

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Well I don't if they are working correctly or not, as I have said I am not a MT user, but you have to understand that for the 1st stage of TD Sequential 9 consecutive down closes less than the close 4 bars before (for a buy, reverse for a sell) so if there are 5 consecutive down close bars and the 6th does not close less than the close 4 bars before - then the count will be removed from the chart.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
attached USDJPY taken yesterday I trade with the trend if I see something technical like a double bottom the I confirm on a lower time frame try to get in at the dips which will also be demark trend line but this time not a break but a bounce. And I also use stoc 14-3-3 on 1 hour and 4 hour and sometimes another stoch indicator DB stochastic but I usually move it out of the way as it clouds up the screen. hope that helps

--- 帖子 #64 ---
dfxclub you trade a break of one of the lines or is there more to it a special line ? best regards Suntrader then maybe that is the repaint it just corrects and erase if the count is abrupted. best regards

--- 帖子 #65 ---
No there are no other lines... but the lines will repaint as new support and resistance lines are occur. Its not repainting but updating the charts. If you were also drawing your own trendlines you would be updating them according to market conditions. This is what this does. I trade as follows: 1- break out of the minor trend when it is going with the main trend as in the USDJPY example - the blue channel is the minor up trend inside the major red trend but Im going against the channel because the main trend is down. Opposite for long trades. 2- you can short on the break of major support trend line or vice versa. 3- you can long on the bounce of a major support trend line or vice versa. If you work back from a bigger time frame to a smaller time frame you can decide better whether to go for a bounce or a break. For example open a USDJPY chart and put the demark on the monthly - weekly - daily - 4 hour and 1 hour You can sharpen your entries. On the daily we are about to hit 98 which is a support line but on the monthly I got 96.45 as majot support - this will be interesting to watch...

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I just took the GBPUSD break on the 15 min chart will see how it works out... On the 15 min chart there was a double top this morning at 6340 area and then pr'ce started to come down. Main trend is down so I put demark on the 15 min chart and entered after it broke the line. The targets are in blue dotted line. What you can do now is move the time frame higher and follow your trade accordingly. In a good trend if you always keep ypur stop 10 pips above the high of the prior 4 hour bar it seems to work well for me for following trends.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
the attached chart now shows the 30 minute chart and the price breached that level too so we can bring stop alittle clooser I guess and follow through... I will also try to post the 1 hour char too in hope that it clarifies the trade method. Basically its just a Demark break out strategy which you refine according to the main trend and enter as early as you can so you can have tight stop losses.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
below is the 1 hour chart now and you can see the new 1 hour bar opened under the demark trend line of the 1 hour. So basically Im now going to bring stop to +2 pip profit as I cant watch it and dont want to make a loss coz my psychology is not strong enough just yet and will take profit at 6086 if it gets there. And will see how it goes once every hour or so.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
This was in reference to TD Sequential, not TD Trendlines.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Im verry happy for help from bouth of you Suntrader and dfxclub and the examples make me understand it little better. Thank You bouth. best regards

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Sun trader I didnt understand what you meant... Am I using this wrong ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
No not at all. jg was referring to repainting on Sequential, not Trendlines. He should understand TL's change all the time. And now he understands why Seq can disappear if the close relationship changes too.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Suntrader more questions. On page 24 in the new science.............. low on that page he begin a new mening by "Basic arithmetic will enable the user" ............................ I dont get that what is it he calculates there i understand a-b and x and y and z but whre does that calculation fit in ? best regards i think this is also spoken about in table 1.1

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Also in the book he speaks about 3 price projectors i think i know how to calculate them you know 1 2 3 and 3 is always the smallest, in your example you used 50 % and 100 % why ? this is not one of the price projectors and also when you use one of the price projectors wicht one do you prefer and wich one of 1 or 2 is the most reliable ? best regards

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I am not totally clear how he uses this method so I disregard it.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I use his standard method, difference of the lowest low underneath TL or highest high above TL subtracted/added to breakout point. I use 50% as a minimum target, but try for 100%/200% if I am not stopped out. Naturally other confirmation is used for entry/exits.

You are a nice guy.We need people like you here.May God bless you.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
i use one only one kind of demark technik: the one where the last 2 significant highs/lows where used to build a trendline. i dont trade this i only use it for confirmation like in the pic from eu this morning, the brokje of the lower TL marks the start of a downswing

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi there, I think I should ask you how confident are you with Tom Demark Trendline break? With the given attachement I should be able to bag at least 50pips. But somewhere down the road there is noise and a hanging man got me spook and I close my short at a mere 2pips. Far worst if I have hold on and let the price run. I always have this problem with TD trendline breaks. I have to close my longs/shorts wherver I see price action takes a turn. My question is how do you prevent such happening?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Everyone has losses but the traders that last are the ones who have no problem taking a loss. It is all a part of the business of trading. On my chart I have added some comments. I have a new much bigger monitor so I hope I don't blow up the screen too much with the resolution I use. I can see why you exited. We all do it for fear of losing what little profit we have or turning an even trade into a loser but to get the big winners we sometimes have to take the chance. Better luck the next time or I should say better execution. (Double-Click the chart image for expanded view)

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Thanks man your chart look so clean

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Yeah thanks. I just got my charts finally the way I want them. And to think it is on my brand new big-azz 28" monitor.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
good indicator

--- 帖子 #85 ---
use it on daily

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Nothing on the daily for EU but on H4 I see this following for next week:

--- 帖子 #87 ---
markdhr, My reply to your email is I basically trade TD Trendlines on reversals keying off of TD SetUp, Sequential or Combo as well as sometimes using TD Wave to identify Elliott Wave counts. And the only thing to do with failures is always, always use a stop. Here is a recent trade where 2 different TD Demand Trendlines (Level 3)were broken and targets hit. Wish they all worked out this way. HTH SunTrader

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi I have a problem wt the scale of the chart using mt4. when i draw a TL on the Weekly for the primary direction and zooming into the d1 for entry. Often times i find the D1 scale for the TL is way off and am not sure if the TL needs to be adjusted to "fit" the D1. Obj is to trade the overall direction of the Weekly. Whats your take guys?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Pardon my ignorance on this topic, but what is the purpose of the "HORIZONTAL" line in the indicator??? The TD Indicator that is. SUNTRADER - I see Tradestation still does not have the "outline candles" after all these years. It used to drive me nutz. Thanks in advance for an help with the horizontal thing. clam

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I'm going to use the charts in post 80 clam. I assume they are the horizontal lines you are speaking about. Demark believes for every action there is an opposite action. Those lines are the projections where the price should go if it is an acceptable break. that is determined by how far away from the TL it goes (opposite direction of break) is how far he believes price will move in the other direction. I personally start to aggressively take profit at about half of that. But to be honest, cutting my trades too quick is the one area I really need to work on. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
this is a good triangle breakout technique........ ok i need to emphasise something here......we know the entry, but how do we plan our stops and profit taking?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi Guys, Does anybody here had TD Wave indicator for MT4, I'm searching for it but nobody seems to have a MT4 version of it. Hope that one of you can share it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Personally how I do it is once I get to +10 I move to BE plus 2 then I just play fractals on the way to 50% target. Once I get to 50% I start getting ready to cut my load in half at my first thought things might not go my way. I trade really tight, this keeps me sane, but find what works for you.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
for me, i am trying a risk to reward ratio of 2:1 this way, i can afford to lose 5-6 trades in 10 trades and still profit. I am planning a set and forget technique. Think is the best way. I feel that we should just stick to 2 pairs the most, this way, we can really track the performance of this technique. I am tracking eur/usd and gbp/usd for this technique. Just got a 90pips profit from gbp/usd break.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
if that is what you want to do, go ahead, it works. Just enter a trade and use one of the trade management EAs you can find on here. when I use one, I use Steve H's. Study it first and good luck

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thanks for the reply. I understand the TP lines, I thought I saw some horizontal lines in the charts posted. Must have been something else on the charts that are not part of the indicator. Appeciate it.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
This indicator is abit one-sided.........i realise the trendlines changes after awhile......is not really a gd way to judge on how to enter a trade.....i think the best indicator is human himself drawing the lines......i could make 3-5k pips a year....so i just stick to it.... another source of income i got was to play penny stocks. those stocks with value of 0.005 that rises 100% in one day. With capital of 5k, i could make 20-30k a year easily.

When you are talking about the breakouts (up or down) must the prior crossing candlestick be the oposite of the direction of the breakout? Does it occur with the candlesticks just driving straight in one direction where as the next candlestick is alway exceeding the previous candlestick in the direction of the breakout (up or down)? (i have seen this happen on several occurances) Also, what should one expect when the TD indicator repaints itself in the middle of the breakout. That has occured to me several times. Should one exit a position if that occurs before the TD profit bar is reached from the first TD indicator? Lastly, can someone explain this breakout explaination alittle more clearer? I am having trouble following the explainations. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Ditto on the above. I didn't fully understand the qualifiers from post #1, especially the ones about "pressure." Maybe a chart diagramming each qualifier? Edit: Found a pdf through google that explains things... looks like post #26 has the same pdf. I just watched a small breakout obey a TD profit extension perfectly, so I'll be keeping an eye on this setup.

Demark Trend Lines The goal of this system is to identify break outs according to a very rigid mechanical system. I use an indicator that will automatically plot the TD Lines to the first magnitude, I then monitor for TD Line breaks. I will trade a TD line break if these criteria are met. I will only trade this in the direction of the major trend for anything that is 1hr or less. To determine the major trend I usually go up one or two time frames. If I’m trading on the 1 hour charts I look for the trend on the 4 hr and daily charts. If I’m trading the daily, I go to the weekly charts to look for the trend. If I can’t easily see the trend is strong I cut my lot size in half. If market is ranging I will only trade it if the range is greater than 150 pips. Scenarios 1-3 are time tested by many who have used this system and I have found them very reliable in my testing. Scenario 4 is something that I’m playing with. Over the last six months of testing and doing this system I have found that I have been successful over 70% of the time with a better than a 1:1 risk to Reward. Scenario 1: X = current candle X-1 = previous candle X-2 = 2 candles before current candle For a Long: If the close of the previous candle (X-1) is lower than the close of the bar two previous of the current bar (X-2) the break out is valid. If X-1 is lower than X-2 then it is a valid break out. For a short: If the close of X-1 is higher than X-2 then the chances are higher that the breakout will continue. Scenario 2: The market opens on the other side of the TL, it gaps in the direction of the breakout. After one tick in the direction of the breakout execute order. Scenario 3: For a short: calculate the difference between X-1 close and the greater of A) that bar’s high, or B) the previous bar’s close. Subtract that value from the close of X-1 and if that number is above the TL, you may short an intraday bar. Scenario 4: This one is not from the Demark or Pearl book. I have been playing with this to see how it works. On a break of the trend line that does not meet the previous three scenarios I enter the trade at half of what I normally enter a trade. I get out of the trade very quickly, still working on.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Simpleguy, if you please, will you post an example of scenario#2.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I don't have any saved trades on charts. The best way to describe it is if a bar closes below the line and opens with a gap up above the line. After 1 tic up you enter. This indicator is used in all markets so this happens often in the futures from what I understand. I have had it happen a few times for me. Scenario 1 has shown to be most profitable followed by #3, and then 4. I have not had enough trades on 2 to make up my mind on it yet but I follow it mechanically.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
for your help. I am using a Demark Trendline indicator set to draw L3 trend lines. Do you you use L3 trendlines? Also, how do you cope when you are in a trade, and the trendline is redrawn? Do alter SL and TP?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I use the L1 point lines, just had more success with that than others. what I do is if the line is redrawn after a confirmed break out I just trail it and play it really tight, especially when it gets down to the trend line again. Personally, if this happens and it confirms another valid break out I will enter another lot on top of the current trade. The way I trade is to use the 123 system as described in the beginning of "the system II" thread, except I keep a much tighter SL on it. I also use "the force 5 min" system concept as bouncing off of TLs for reversals and the Demark indicator for a break out indicator. remember, this isn't a system, just another indicator. to the person that says he likes to draw his own lines, that's fine. This is fine too, as long as you understand what is happening and why.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Does anyone have a PDF file explaining what all the lines, the x and the arrows mean on the demark_trend_new indicator please, or can someone explain in detail how this one is/gets used. I've been watching it and trying to use it nowdays but the lines keep changing, I just don't know what to do in this situation, please tell me what LL1 (blue line), HL1(red line), HCL1 (red line) and LCL1(blue line) mean, there are also "channels" which form, for what I'm not sure, could it mean that if the price of new bar goes above the higher part of a red channel that it's the start of a long trade? If there's a sudden new trend line that occurs could it mean that the current trend is coming to an end? I'd appreciate ANYONE'S help who's using this indicator just to check trends

--- 帖子 #107 ---
The trendlines could change every new candle. the horizontal lines are profit projections. I don't rely on them, start taking profits at less than 50% of the projection. they will move, don't worry about them. Basically Demark believed that the farther away from a line the price moves the more potential the trade has. For example. lets say the price moves 50 pips above the lower TL, the profit lines will be 50 pips below the TL Hope that helps, let me know if you need more. Simple

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Thanks for wanting to help but, that doesn't really help me very much, I'm actually looking at these trend lines more in terms of diRECTION than in terms of where my profit would lie, would it be safe to assume that as soon as a candle crosses the top of a red line and a blue line already exists that i can go long until the wave crosses the bottom of the blue line again (then wait for another red line to go short again)?? Also, can you tell me what the use of arrows and crosses are, are the up/down arrows now buy/sell signals or what

--- 帖子 #109 ---
today. Simpleguy, this does not look qualified to me. The comments are ambiguous. False break, yet, profit targets are given!?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
albeit late...signal candle close at 108.94. I bought at 109.32, 10 pips above H of signal candle. So far so good. I am new at Demark trading.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
My 4 hr chart has slightly different bars (which can happen with forex depending on the broker source for data): My EU chart had a down close before TL breakout so it is valid. Your EJ chart didn't have TD Point where the TL is drawn from so it doesn't look valid to me. The indicators I have though are from Tom DeMark directly so as long as my data is correct I would presume there are right. MetaTrader I don't know.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
guys for this trendline trading i have noticed that on the 3rd bounce of a trendline(moveing upwards) if you buy 90% of the time the trade will make at least 50pips. This is for the gy. it should work for all pairs. proof of this is in the screenshot attached to the quoted post(should be like in the first few postings of this thread)

--- 帖子 #113 ---
sorry. i forgot to add. when the price hits the trendline on the third bounce, buy! have a look and backtest you will see this pattern aslo. but great post, i really like trendline trading. thanks dude!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
the points the Down TL was drawn from (red arrows) on the chart in post #109 . I am using L1 TLs. Perhaps I just don't understand, but I don't see a problem with the TL. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Those TL's on new chart pic are correct. But where you put the "not a fractal?" comment is not one since it doesn't have a higher high (it doesn't on my chart) or if it is higher it is only by a pip or two - can't tell from your chart pic. Even if it does have a ever so slightly higher high pivot I wouldn't trade it myself. Maybe on a longer term timeframe - daily or higher.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
The candle in question has a higher H than the preceding candle by a mere 3 pips(and by a clear margin a higher H than the succeeding candle). Technically, it is a L1 fractal. The ind. I use, which was set to draw L1 trendlines, drew a line from that point. This method appears very rational to me. I don't understand why it dosen't get more play here at FF. Do you you know if Demark has statistical/historical data for this method?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Yeah but you have to look at it on a practical level that even with that candles having a HH by 3 pips it and the two previous candles had very similar highs so that really was a consolidation/hesitation zone and not a more truer pivot swing high area - price trending higher till it ops and reverses trending lower. Tom DeMark has been trading and advising major players for 4 decades but whatever stats he has he's kept to himself and his clients. But I'm sure a believer for my own use and experience.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
what broker you guys using my fxdd demo account charts dont seem to match yours.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Mine doesn't match either, I use TradeStation. And that was my point about how some of those TL's are are drawn.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Does ANYONE have a decent exit trategy that can be used on this indi? At moment I'm trying the parabolic because this indi doesn't always SHOW a reversal in trend and before you know it, you've lost all your profits Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #121 ---
What timeframe?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
M15

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I'm sorry if confuse you (by the way, thanks for help in advance) but I'm wanting an exit strategy on the trend_new indi on either H4 or D1 frame. Another thing, I'm not sure if I'm entering correctly but when there's an arrow I take the trade, correct? Or just wait for a candle to move out of one of the trend lines? Is this CORRECT?? or how does one exactly enter this indi? By the way, concerning the M15 time frame? This indi would'nt be suitable for it due to its short time, the higher frame you trade in the more your profits Thanks

--- 帖子 #124 ---
zukies, for an exit strategy that depends on you. personally I don't allow the trade to go more than 15 pips against me and move my SL to BE+1 as soon as the charts show that I can. But that's my style, once I know I have avoided a loss I feel like I'm on a free ride, but that's me. Plenty of people on here will say I'm a fool for using this, it's too small of a SL in the higher TF, but it's what works for me and keeps me from going bunkers while I'm trading my other stuff. I would suggest you use one of the strategy testers out there and try different ways to see what suits your personality. I have used Vhands before and have found it very useful. You can also use it to learn to trade better, a lot more practice time working on a tic by tic trades. do a years worth of daily trades in a few hours. I have found something that shows a lot more profit than what I am using now but can't stand the swings.

Hi all, I have idea or perhaps it's alREADY written, IF there already IS a version like I'm gonna explain then please give, I'm looking for a version of the first post but can ANYONE perhaps edit this indi in a way that instead of using the rules from the first post just put buy/sell arrows in so that people visiting here don't HAVE to go through those rules, the arrows just show whether the trade is valid, if this can be done it'll be absolutely GREAT because apparently this indi is rather accurate????? I'm using trend_currently and I think there are others that are more accurate? Maybe I'm using it wrong? (Basically I just wait for a breakout of one of the TL's Thanks

Hi Mr DeMark, I'm a complete newb at this indi and I'm very interested in it, since you've given the rules on breakouts would you mind sharing with me an illustration of each qualifier via some chart examples please, there are some of these qualifiers that I just don't understand; I would like to know what to look for with this: I'm now referring to the downside breakout qualifier Some of the things that confuse me is what "buying pressure" means (where do you find it on the chart-ON this indi), is it just the candle been forced up by bulls? You speak of the TD "demand line", I found TD but it's not a line, it's fractals, do I take HC1 (red line) as this demand line? And ONE last thing, do ALL requirements need to meet before taking a trade or you only need one or two to trade?? and do you have english version, so to read writing on top THANK YOU IN ADVANCE

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Thanks david486, I look forward to that, I've also attached aNOTHER of DeMarks indi's called the Trend_New indi which aPPARENTLY is pretty accurate, I've been using it but on demo (I SAY unfortunately cos at the time of trading I was scoring SERIOUS pips-&gt;900 off about 5 trades if i remember right and it was on DEMO!) ;( it SEEMS one can use on any pair and the higher the time frame the more your profits, it's an indi that just has buy/sell arrows added in it because apparently a lot of times the origional FROM demark didn't produce arrows when it SHOULD'VE resulting in a lot of missed trades. I found this indi on THIS site as well, just can't remember WHERE though. I have been now trying to work on an exit strategy for it because a lot of time you'd get a LOT of pips and then there's a reversal and the indi doesn't quite SHOW to get out a lot of times, at mo I'm trying with parabolic sar. The main reason I'm using THIS indi at mo is trying to drive a system with parabolic sar on its own one could lose a lot from ranging markets, not only does this indi help to get in before the reversal SHOWS via parabolic but it helps to stay OUT of the ranging markets. Perhaps this could be an addition to someone's "toolbox" I find it rather helpful. Yes you can lose sometimes but this indi is purely based on DeMarks rules, the ONLY thing that was added was more buy/sell arrows Hope it helps someone, although, I DID put it in this thread because you guys are discussing DeMark and it IS one of his indi's, and besides, the thread i got it from has died, I'm hoping someone could try it out and add their 5c worth, maybe we can somehow make something of it. If we can get a decent exit strategy going better than par I have a nice little semi-auto robot that can be used WITH this indi on D1 or even WEEKLY pulling SEEEEEEERIOUS pips!!!!! (the robot is called firebird in case newbies haven't heard of it???) I don't know, this is just my 5c worth. What helps me with this indi + par, if indi is going against par I give it about 2 candles and by that time par hasn't changed direction then i cancel the trade. Best of all, it works on ANY pair I've added a trade I'm currently on, notice how the arrow showed a change in direction even BEFORE par showed anything. I've also added this indi becuase often times using par on it's own is fine but too often shows a change in trend too late (the candle has already changed direction resulting either in less profit or loss). On 1st July when the trend changed on the daily chart on EUR/USD pair? This indi gave an arrow as SOON as the trend changed! I think it's an indi worth taking a look Like i said, just my 10c worth

Hi all. This system is quite intresting. But regardless of what time frame you use, we still get fake signals. I'm trying to combine the signals of demarker with trix set to D1, for filtering. Wonder if other fellow traders use different approaches. Thanks and regards

--- 帖子 #138 ---
This is what I mean. Quite a shame to see this thread abandoned. A simple, yet effective way of analizying the trend, and depending on your risk appettite, possible set ups for 50(0) to 100(0) pips profit. By using this set up on H4, once or twice a week, when breakouts occur, on different pairs, combined with a good dose of patience, it can be very profitable. Regards

--- 帖子 #139 ---
BTW Forgot to add that trix indicators DO NOT REPAINT !!! Same goes to trendlines, they do not repaint. It will be considered invalid if its a fake breakout, hence the trix for confirmation. Regards

--- 帖子 #140 ---
No need to reinvent the wheel as TD Trendlines already have qualifiers to trade or fade.

HI, I have been researching the subject of DeMark indicators and latterly DM Trendlines for a while now and it seems that many learned contributors have discussed this back over time on this thread. I wonder if anyone can help me with the following: 1. An up to date MT4 Indicator for DM trendlines and targets please. 2. An answer to, Is there an indicator/signal that gives a simple signal to confirm whether the DeMark "qualifying" price action criteria are met (ie one of the 3/4 qualifying criteria)? And if so is such available? 3. An up to date MT4 Indicator for TD Sequential and any of the other TD strategies. Many thanks in anticipation

hi, i am currently using Demark Trendline Indicator as a useful tool in my forex toolbox, and i have a question. I keep seeing 'TD' in this post. What does TD mean?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thomas Demark, google him, you will find everything you need

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Thank you! Silly of me, i thought it was like a technical term or something. Thanks, i've done some googling and found a nice pdf ebook on it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Look up this guy, Jason Pearl, He wrote a book on Demark Indicators. I think he did a better job of describing how to use them than Demark did. Also remember, Demark said his indicators can be used on small time frames but thinks they work best on higher time frames, but I also think that is just a personal preference by him also. good luck

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi, i just discovered Demark actually had indicators. Was always drawing the trend lines manually. This looks like a very beautiful thread, i wish we could keep it alive. If anyone out there is using this indicator with success pls post your results so we can all share and learn. Thanks

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I've been using them for quite some time and eventually moved away from them and started to draw them manually for a semi - automated trading system. I then found several Line traders EA out there, and tweaked Trendmeleaveme into iDRAW 1.4 and now I'm working on fully automation now. Here is the Free version for the semi Auto system - http://www.pipinvestment.com/Menu/979 .... with the combination of demark trendlines and the Free iDRAW version, you will enjoy some freedom away from the desk.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Most end up using H4 as their preferred setup, however, PipCOP.com ran an auto pilot version of Demark Live and it didn't last long ( maybe a few months) after that, most ppl dropped the concept and moved on. Others tried more timeframes but what makes the overall difference is filtering all the signals. from the constant TrendLine drawing.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
aawww. Here it is. Thought I said this before

--- 帖子 #180 ---
That is correct, TD expects it to be a manual trading INDICATOR. It is not a complete system. You would never expect to trade something into S/R and no take profit when it hits that area cause an indicator said you should. Basic filters: going with trend, make sure market has plenty of room to move so you can get a good fat tail trade Works well when all criteria are met

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thanks mate, but it seems i could not get the free version. Anyway, i intend to enter not at the break of the trend line but one or two pips above the close of that candle. Will definately try 4hr time frame but execute trade on the 15min. Tried it this morning on the E/U and came with 10pips. Could have been more if i wasn't emotional. Have you had any success trading this?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks for the Jason Pearl tip. Tom DeMark is brilliant, imho. So brilliant that those of us with an average IQ, it would take the remainder of our lives to wade through his books. I bought, and began reading his book, "The New Science of Technical Analysis". I made it all of the way to the end of chapter 2, before I decided I was in over my head. But for me, this was the meat and potatoes. What I mean by that, is he clearly explains how to use trend line breaks (TLB's) and how to calculate price objects based on these TLB's. Using his methods, I have studied charts extensively over the past few years. btw imho; EA's are not worth my time. This opinion is not intended to annoy anyone so if it does I apologize in advance. Here's the deal on EA's. They are mechanical and lack intelligence and are unwavering in their approach. Their may, in fact, be a few EA's out there that can average a few percent annualized. I believe NOTHING will replace taking the time to personally read charts and achieve some level of understanding and taking advantage of Pure Price Action. I will show you how I use Tom DeMark, level 2 and above, TLB's &amp; Price Projections (TDPP's). But right now I need to take advantage of good weather and get some yard work done. Tom DeMark On Youtube: Inserted Video If you always do what you always did, you'll always get what you always got. and you'll always feel what you've always felt.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
The way that I figured out how to trade it was by printing out a chart, running through the rules and figured it out. They I looked at it and tried to figure out why I would or would not want to take the trade with the privilege of hindsight. After I did that I went through trading simulator with it. This allowed me to understand this indicator well enough to understand it. Good luck with your studies!

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Tom would probably not be too pleased with me and the way I've modified how I apply his trend lines, although he might allow for the fact that I use this method primarily on 15m, 1 &amp; 4hr charts instead of Daily. I've looked at plenty of charts and after a while you start to see the same patterns repeated over and over. So I began trading live 2 weeks ago and am not disappointed at all. Wins, I won't mention. Losses were one Thursday &amp; one Friday. Thursday I had just gotten into an EU TLB trade, it was a few pips in profit and Mr. Buffet announced $5 billion trade in B of A (Nick Name boa). Before I could double check to make sure I was looking at the correct chart, it was over, and I was stopped out for my 1st loss. Friday was an honest loss on the aud/usd, also during the US session. This chart shows how I get my initial Price Projection figures, from which I determine a set of price targets. This is where I deviate from Tom's methods using a fractional approach.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
All technical analysis books are choosing those specific patterns that coincide with their theory, not mentioning the trades where the pattern aligned with the theory but then resulted in a failed trade. Murray math lines was a good example of this. Out of the thousands of stocks on the NYSE there will always be a few that coincide exactly with the harmonic levels. Murray then sent out emails only mentioning the closest match and price confirmation(winning trade), not mentioning the hundreds of other stocks where the trade would have failed. Technical analysis books are money making scams, selling people a pipe dream. Those who know what to look for won't place that information in books.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
++++++++++++++++ This is quite true some of the time. I get numerous emails daily from people telling me how their system will make me rich in no time. I rarely look at them anymore. They just go straight to junk. Here's something else to consider. We all have different filters (perceptions provide by past experience) which can and do slant our methods of interpretation. So there is often much left out of, or misinterpreted, regarding the various methods presented. Cases in point. Many of the charts displayed in this thread demonstrate to me, that what Mr. DeMark has developed, and how thread contributors have understood it, in some cases, are miles apart. Being a male, I also realize that our gender is most guilty of withholding information (imho), not to be malicious, but because in our minds we think that because we understand something, that everyone else does too, so details are quite often left out. I ave studied many methods from various sites, individuals, and videos. Some, I felt, were 100% crap. But on the whole, most had a nugget or two that help to build my trading knowledge. To these many helpful sources I owe a lot. 2¢

--- 帖子 #187 ---
This 15m EU chart is one example of how I trade Mr. DeMark's trend line breaks. This set up is unusual because it begins during the US session and concludes the next day during the FF/London session. Most of my 15m set ups occur beginning sometime late in the Asian session, to early in the US session on the same day. I will only use Level 2, or higher Swing points. The level is determined by how many higher/lower candles are on either side of the swing. Level 2 has 2 higher/lower candles on either side. Level 3, has 3 on either side, etc. Unlike Mr. DeMark I do not usually take consecutive swing points for my trend line purposes with the exception of Daily &amp; 4hr charts. After reviewing hundreds of charts, mostly 15m, I've seen how consecutive swings cost money on lower level time frames. The attachments show my basic set up. I will not take 15m trades with less than a 32 pip TDPP (Tom DeMark Price Projection) because my entry is usually 6 pips beyond the TLB. Here's why; I have levels at which I begin taking profit that would make price projection numbers less than 32 not worthwhile. Profit Targets: 38% Level - I close 25% of my position. 50% Level - 50% of my position My current stats show that a high number of trades reach at least 80% of the TDPP. So my remaining positions I hold onto an begin closing at 80% and 100% of the price projection. I will usually leave 5 or 10% trailing in the case of a larger move. Sometimes that small position will add up to a big profit. Not often, but it's fun to ride when it does. I use the Fib lines for profit targets, they are drawn from the trend line break of the candle that is used for entry. On this example, 2 candles actually broke through the trend line, but did not travel to meet my criteria of 6 pips beyond the trend line breach.

++++++++++++++++++ I do have a pretty good handle on the basic operation of trend line breaks and price projections, however after reading the thread, I can guarantee that SunTrader and Simpleguy have much broader and deeper knowledge of what Mr. DeMark is teaching than I do. Chart analysis on trend line breaks is something I have done extensively and this has helped me come to some conclusions which do serve me well. One major thing that this analysis has helped me with is identifying price action patterns. One of my favorites is rapid price movement. I'll post one of those charts later. Quite often I am awake for the 1st 2-3 hours of the FF/London session. If you are on skype send me a pm and we can set a meeting. Darryl

Today's E/U Pair looks fairly easy now with the aid of foresight. But when i took my sell this morning at 1.44809, I felt everything about this trade was wrong.The tendline was at 1.44773 and the previous trendline break happened an hour or so earlier. Well, must have been lucky cos i got my first TP1 for 20pips and TP2 for 50 pips. Will check back during the NY session for some thing else Finally got the skype downloaded Adeleke80

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Adeleke, Great trade! yes it's that easy. The most important thing is that you kept a portion on for the +50 and got a nice big fat tail. Personally the way I look at it one decent or good trade can wipe out all of my little "failing trades" for a week or two! Something for you to look at. if you were online during that time, look at the lines on the 1hr chart. it would have gotten you in 20 pips earlier and told you to run with it for a TP 2 of 100 pips maybe. ( this is being said looking in hindsight and not knowing your personal trading style so take it with a grain of salt. Just something for you to think about ) My real world work is messing with me, I'll be back trading next week again. It's killing me not being able to really do it. I need my trading fix! Think you did great, keep it up! Simple

--- 帖子 #197 ---
+++++++++++++++ Hi SG. I'm guessing that you do not enter the trade until the close of the candle in the TF your trade is based in. Is that correct? But my most important question is where would your stop loss have been? I see price retraced 30 pips from the 1.4476 entry. PP was about 60. Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #198 ---
First a Disclaimer: I was not on for this trade. I was just trying to show another potential entry that could have worked great. I will determine how I enter the trade based on momentum. If I feel we have great momentum I will enter on break. If low momentum, I will enter on close. If it's a trade i just don't like I'll wait for a pull back and then see if it has gained momentum. I might have been taken out on this trade. My MM in a trade is to move my SL to BE + 2 or 3 after we have a move . then I wait for price to stall or basically do anything that just doesn't sit well with me and I take half off. Now it's just a waiting game, either it will progress towards the further TP levels. While price moves forward I look for more opportunities to add to the position. In a situation like today where it could come back and take out my SL, i would look at it and decide if i would be interested in take a trade for a second time in that area. I generally will play it as S/R like this one.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi gentlemen, its about 30min after the London open and am looking at E/U 15mins chart. the trendlines was just broken upwards at 1.44349 but also the price projection has been breached. Think i'll wait for a pull back then let Demark decide. Cheers

--- 帖子 #200 ---

I almost missed this trade because I was away from the computer. I also found love with the usd/chf.

Remind me never to question your opinion again. After hours of hoping and praying for E/U to go up, had to exit manually with a -20pips on each entry. Terrible. Sill not sure what PA is heading today but i ain't going with it. Will use the rest of the day to learn more about abc patterns

Current EU trade. • Entry at 1.4422. • 80% out at 1.4405 • Remaining at BE Should be quite alot of trader pent up emotion. Trying for another 50 to a hundred based only on my opinion of potential market action. BTW: I use the fibs to mark for profit areas not for price movement calculation.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
For better or worse here's a current trade I have put on. Slightly better than 1:1. Waited until price retested trend line &amp; was rejected by 1.4420 area. • Entry @ 1.4404 • Stop @ 1.4468 • Target 1.4335 We shall see.

My friend, you know your onions.Hope one day i'll be able to trade as good as you. Had to go for a business meeting today and could not trade. Had time to study my chart more. By the way, what are those boxes on your chart? Some indicators?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The boxes are very High Priority Top Secret Areas of Time Sensitive Confidential Information and can be rented for a mere $900 monthly.. Just kidding.. It's called an iSessions indicator. You can place the boxes during any time period, and color that you choose. Mine are set up to highlight The Asian session up to the FF Open. The first 3 hours of the FF/London session. And the 1st 3 hours of the US session. 15m trend line trades, and other trades I look for, I will only take during FF/London 1st 3hrs. For US session I only take 15m trend lines for the 1st hour. After that follow through is not as likely. ™ If time is an issue for you look on higher time frames. Here's one I missed. gbp/nzd daily. I would have taken profit at 600. It's about at 900 now. Good Hunting, Darryl

--- 帖子 #211 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks SG. Your explanation is helpful and appreciated.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Thanks for sharing your "very High Priority Top Secret" indicator. Will add it to my arsenal and see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Diamonddbw, I got a question, is it possible to make all the tendlines appear at once? That way i can go back and view the conditions of a good trade . Thanks.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ There are indies that draw each and every swing trend line. I do not use anything like that because all swing points are not created equal, in my opinion. If you review charts that I have posted, you'll see that there are swing points that I chose to ignore. In the eyes of a TD purest, this might be frowned upon. Ultimately, we are all responsible for our own accounts and fully understanding our own trading methods. I, like others on this thread, have spent a lot of time of time learning what Tom DeMark has taught. I doubt that any 2 people on the this thread apply Tom's methods exactly the same way. At this point I spend much of my time reviewing various charts and looking for trend lines that make sense. This is a practice in which I am constantly learning more about valid swing points, in respect to price action. Although you may see one moving average and one oscillator on my charts, 99% of the time I don't even see these when I'm considering a trade. They are left over indies from another method. I also have built a database for compiling info on trades that I research. I am looking for these answers: • What distance does price travel in respect to the trend line breach? • What is the percentage of the TD Price Projection achieved? • How many pips did each trade win or lose? After reviewing thousands of charts I begin to form opinions on what I think will work best for me, based on what I see and, of course, my empirical results. Other things that become apparent from this research are: • What qualifiers I use to enter a trade once there is a trend line breach. • What is the Minimum price projection needed, to have a profitable trade? i.e.; A. If my trend line break entry is 15 pips beyond the trend line breach, and B. my spread is 3 pips, and C. my price projection is 25 pips and D. based on price, my stop should be 20 pips Once this information is taken into consideration, I feel I can then make an informed decision, in regards to, should I take the trade or not. Obviously, unless I never lose a trade, I would not have entered this set up. Indies and EA's are tools that meant a great deal to their developers. What exactly that is, quite possibly, will never be fully expressed, and therefore, not fully understood. That being said, if each trader realizes this and continues his/her own studies of price action, trend lines, indicators and EA's, until they either make sense, or are cast aside, then I can guarantee, that success in trading is considerably more likely. Here are screenshots of information I gather for each trade, live and backtest:

Hi Diamonddbw, Check this out, just took a sell on the E/U at 1.41325, using the 15mins trend break, let see how it goes. my first TP is 20pips

--- 帖子 #216 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Looks like you have a winner. I cannot figure what your 2nd swing is. Got a chart?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Entered the gbp/nzd about 11pm NY at 1.9161, on a 4hr tlb. The first chart is a one hour because the platform I used for the trade (GFT) is different than the one I use for analysis ( Oanda ). The second chart shows the 4hr set up. Currently up about 200 with my stop approx 60 in profit. I used one small position on this trade because it is a reversal trade, which carries more risk. When you can catch them they are usually quite profitable. So I'll keep trailing this one up. I got out early the last time this pair changed direction going long and missed out on so many pips that if I were to mention it here, I would begin crying... Darryl

--- 帖子 #218 ---
This trade was based on a 1hr set up. This was also a reversal trade which I liked a lot. However it did not work out. My Risk/Reward for target 1 was 2:5 and I used only about 1/2 my normal trade size because of it being a reversal trade. The only thing missing from this set up was a decent intermediate swing that is usually there on good set ups.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
• Currently keeping an eye on usd/chf 4hr. I know my earlier 1hr trade got stuffed, however it could be that price is lining up for a move as early as sometime in Tuesday London session or NY. • The chart below shows a steep 4hr TL. Too steep for my liking but sometimes these work out. If price does break here, I will not be in. I need to see another significant swing for me to use as swing point #2. • Have a look at all high level charts for this pair. There are super long tails on all of them. • 2nd chart is 4hr showing TL break on Aug. 12th. This one is a very obvious break because the swings are so prominent. That trade would have been good for quick 300 with virtually no drawdown. Keep your eyes open for all trending pairs on 1hr, 4hr &amp; Daily. Not all pairs trend all of the time, but most trend, with TL entries some of the time. Darryl

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I will watch the pairs you are watching. I love copying Pros. Hope i will be able to catch the trade when you do. My second trade TP was just 30pips. Was very uncomfortable with both trade and got out early. i should post my next trade and chart as soon as i learn how to.?

gbp/nzd entry from about 20 hour ago. The chart you're looking at is a 1hr, so it does not show the 4hr entry. This way it is easier to see. Up almost 300 now. Stop at 1.9300, underneath some support. Second shot shows 4hr entry. When this pair get a head of steam it can go for awhile. If the euro or the kiwi gets strong I will bail.

Can't believe i sat by while all this movement happened. Was waiting for a pull-back while hundreds of pips went by . God, i'm gonna jump in a river

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hey Adeleke, With SNB intervention like that its best in the long run not to be playing believe me. It could just as easy have gone the other way, skipped your stops and really put you in the river. there is always another day and a forex market remember Nigel

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Some of the smartest words I heard recently in the forum! I saw this happen, turned it off cause I knew the market basically had to reset and this would just be gambling.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Couldn't agree more. Intervention, or big news items can really skew the markets and screw you. Of course it's human nature to think; "OMG, Look at all of those pips I've missed out on". This nature of thought is emotional. Emotions are at foundation of inconsistency. Once your emotions are almost the same, whether you are winning or losing, you stand the best chance of making intelligent and unbiased trading decisions. If, on the other hand, your head is spinning and your blood pressure is going through the roof, there is NO WAY you can be consistent. Your decisions during these times are based on F.E.A.R. (False Evidence Appearing Real) &amp; Greed. If this is the state you are in while trading just be aware that you are doing this, and thinking this way. After a time, it's quite possible that you will gradually change simply by being aware. Or you will lose all of your money and give up. These are the only 2 possible outcomes. 2¢

I did manage one decent 15m eu trend line break. This was about 2 hours into the NY session. The black line was the first one I looked at, but the entry would have been about 5 minutes prior to news, so I waited. Then after the news price did not cooperate. The blue TL was good. Price advance to 64% of the TD Price Projection before pulling back to less than entry price. I made an error regarding price projection so I got out about 10 pips early.

Thanks man, learning alot already

Hello SunTrader, how are you? I am about to Tom Demark service directly from Marketstudies.com. They have a "prime" service which gives you access to all of the TD indicators. Would you recommend this service? I am trying to learn and understand as much as I can before subscribing. I would like to learn more about using TD trend lines and TD sequential and combo indicators. Reading and understanding the qualifiers for the trend lines and breaks are not easy. I understand the 1st qualifier, that seems easy--the price bar prior to an upside break must be a down bar. After this I am lost: qualifier 2: The current price bar's open must be greater than both the current td supply line and the previous price bar's close and must then trade at least 1 tick higher. Ok, first, the current price bar is that the live bar or the actual bar that breaks the trend line? Second, if the open is greater than td supply line would that not mean the line is already broken? I understand that the open has to be higher than the previous bars and must trade at least 1 ticker higher. What is buying or selling pressure? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hello, When looking at price breaking a TD trend line, which bar(s) do you evaluate the 4 qualifiers on to confirm a break? - if you use the actual bar that penetrates the line but it does not close on the other side but meets one of the qualifiers, does that count as a break? - if you use the actual bar that penetrates the line and it closes on the other side but does not meet one of the qualifiers but subsequent bar(s) do, is this considered a break? - if it does penetrate and closes on the other side and meets one of the criteria where and when is the entry? - finally, is the signal stronger if more than one qualifier is met? http://chart.ly/2l8h9rf Please see attached chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks in advance for any insights provided.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
First I would say until you are clear with all of Tom DeMark's techniques I'd hold off paying for his "Prime" service unless paying for a few months until you get it all together is not a big deal. I still many years later have to look back on notes and his books/articles to refresh my mind. Now as far as qualifier #2 this is when price gaps above previous close and therefore likely the supply line plus trades at least a tick higher. Qualifier# 3 looks for buying pressure of previous bar to be exceeded on current bar. Buying pressure is the amount of the bar from the low upto the close. So if, for example EURUSD from Friday's trading, 1.3402 (close) - 1.3362 (low) = BP of .0040 - that amount is then added to close to obtain level 1.3442 that must be exceeded next trading day, if a supply line was present. As it is a demand line is lower so selling pressure would be calculated instead and be the reverse - amount of the bar from the high down to close 1.3548 - 1.3402 = SP .0146 subtracted from close gives a level of 1.3256 to watch for whether it is exceeeded. Qual#2 is hard to apply in forex since how real are gaps on weekends and almost unheard of during weekdays so Qual#1 and Qual#3 really only apply and most other markets as well. HTH its all I have time for today.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
fxxtrader, The best source for clear rules is DeMark Indicators by Jason Perl. But further to my previous post and yours - all the qualifiers assume that breakout bar continues in the breakout direction. For when it doesn't there are three TD Line cancellations: If price bar immediately following an upside (reverse for downside) qualified breakout opens below breakout price level, then exit. If price bar immediately following the breakout bar opens below the close of the breakout price bar and then closes below breakout price level, then exit. If price bar immediately following breakout bar fails to exceed the high of breakout price bar upside, then exit. Also I don't believe having more than one qualifier met is stronger than otherwise. Thursday could see a TL breakout down in EURUSD - see chart. HTH

Thanks for the clarification. Now I know why trend lines disappear--they get cancelled. However, my charting package changes the colour of certain trend lines, why is that? Also, some of my trendlines extend into the future where other just stop. Is there a explanation for this? Thanks in advance.

Hi All, Just three questions: 1)Is there an indicator that alerts when a valid breakout is set up, one which doesn't make all the other indis on my chart disappear? (Yes, I got one, if someone would like it 2) Do all the crieteria have to be met before a breakout of the TD line is valid, or if just one is enough, is theere a ranking in order of importance? 3) If this method is as good as most people seem to think, is this method tradable with an EA, or is it too subjective? Thanks,

1) Don't use MT 2) one criteria is good enough 3) Not EA tradeable IMO

Ok I assumed you read this thread from the start (not that long you know) and therefore would be familar with the fact I am a TradeStation user and not an MT user. So I have not opinion on MT but I also knowledge where to find Tom DeMark indicators for it. Maybe a forum search might find different versions available. There are multiple TD topics here.

Does this Tom Demark has a website ?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
u should read this book, "The new science of technical trading" is awesome. I just want to say i use the TD Trendlines and breakouts in my system and they perform great. Also with the breakouts i look on relevant fundamental data released that day like Unemployment claims, ADP Non Farm, Non Farm change etc then i watch pa on the breakout for validation also i only trade on 4h or more. Also if you like demark, you should read alexander elder and his methods.

Using this Demark indicator alone for breakout will dry up your account quick.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I have just one quick question and confusion regarding how td supply lines (let's just use supply line as example, once htis question is answered, the answer to td demand line is naturally resolved too) are drawn in the case when the more recent td point is ABOVE instead of below the preceding td point, hence creating an increasing instead of declining td suppply line. Tom demark, in both his books (new market timing techniques, and day trading options) clearly stated that this td supply line is only eligible if it is declining but he did not specify what to do with the 2 td points in this event. say we already have a declining td supply line level 1 (let's call them A and B, with B the more recent td point), then now we discovered a new td level 1 point C, however, C is higher than than B, now what do we do? do we discard the C and still keep the original td line (connected by A and B) intact, using it to determine whether future breakouts are qualified? or do we simply NOT have any active level 1 td line until we find a td level 1 point D such as line CD is downward sloping? and if CD is not, test if BD is declining and if BD is not, if AD is. Thank you very much in advance for any guidance any one of you can provide. I would really appreciate it!

Anyone knows of an TD-Indicator that draws Trendlines from LOWER Timeframes in the HIGHER Timeframe? i.E. if I like to show the Trendlines from the H1 in the H4 . I appreciate any suggestions. Thanks. Greeds Zack

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hello friends, I use TD lines from awhile but I have some problems with the qualifiers and speciality with third qualifier- the buying and selling pressure. The problem is that, when I calculate the buying or selling pressure of the previous bar: Upside breakout qualifiers Qualifier 3: “The previous price bar’s close plus the previous bar’s “buying pressure” (the low point of the bar) must be below the current price bar’s TD Supply Line price level.” Downside breakout qualifiers And for selling pressure: The previous price close minus the previous bar’s “selling pressure”(the high point of the bar) must be above the current price bar’s TD Demand Line price level. And here Im not sure, somewhere write that the GREEN BAR= BUYING PRESSURE and RED BAR= SELLING PRESSURE is it true? And if its true, if we have Upside breakout and previus bar is red how to calculate this? From the close to low point or from the close to high point? Its confusing. Next problem with the same qualifier is that almost every time this rule is incorect, becouse the price continues in "incorect" direction and so it goes that if I was open the position I would win a lot of pips, but the qualifier say different.... What is wrong? I will post the pictures to see what I mean:

--- 帖子 #260 ---
simple. Use the td trendlines indicator on the 4hr timeframe. Redraw using your supported broker tools. Then go to lower timeframe and watch price react to your last drawn trendlines. You can also set the td trendlines indicator to not be seen on the 1hr timeframe? Sometimes if problem arise and solution are not at near sight. Be creative, be flexible. After tom demark trendlines are nothing more then support and resistance and angled support and resistance. The important part is price action and reaction, whether price will ignore the resistance or get reject. Or break then fall back causing a fake breakout.

Hello, I have this indicator Demark trend trader which I want to test in demo.This indicator has a alert function in it but I dont know why its not functioning. It will be very useful,If anyone can see through the code and tell me whats wrong.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Here is DeMark on D1, L2 TLs ...Always promising, and puzzling... Beguiling... To trail, or to use TPs? At times the TP levels look completely illogical... Has everyone abandoned this?????? SunTrader????????

--- 帖子 #265 ---
which of the TD indicators would anyone consider the most reliable, the primary ones are the TD Sequential, I have them plotted on my ES chart but so far they are not what I expected, in most cases after a 9 count sequential on a Buy oe Sell set up, I have observed that the signals result into a loss, any comments from anyone on the best way to use these indicators would be appreciated

Hi, Im try to use Demark method but something I dont get it... A lot of times when price break one of the line and when I put a sell or buy stop below or above that candle, price reach that stop and then price back and go against me... How to filter the real break from tha fakes? I know the 3-4 qualifiers but its the same with them... For example I will put 2 pics and if you can, please comment it.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
You have those little pesky small range bars for Sunday trading throwing things off. Also the qualifiers work but they are not infallible.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I am not a MT user so I can't comment on TP levels it plots. But in any case I can say TP's are not always hit.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hello all,I was wondering if there is a modified version of demark trendline indicator which alers when the price closes below or above the trend line. As in the original version it alerts when the price touches the trendline,which is not helpful.If there is such a modified version please post it here or guide me to the right place. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi everyone, can I ask you for little help? I will attach 2 pics of USD/CAD first is daily and show me a up trend and we have a break of TD bottom line with first qualifier. But is against the trend so I didnt entry yet. On the second pic. is weekly chart we have a down trend and If you draw one trend line, will see that price is touch that trend line and bounce ( the price of weekly also is break upper TD line with second qualifier) So.. Im confused hire... First on daily is up trend but break down TD, on weekly is down trend but break the upper TD and bounce down from the trendline.... How to read the chart in such a moment?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
You only concern yourself with the timeframe you are trading. Also trend only matters in that a qualified break is naturally expected to go counter-trend.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Sorry my english is not very well So to avoid other time frames, and looking only one time frame, and the trend direction does not matter right? Sun Trader, how exactly you trade with TD lines? Do you trade with EMA9,30 and momentum, or you use something other tools for filtering the breaks in addition to the 3 qualifiers?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hello all Need some help What we do in this case? We have a trandline from points A and B. A and B (B is lower then A) are followed by C: 1. C is higher then B but lower then A? Do we extend the trendline and the new one is now made by A and C? 2. C is higher then A and B? We just ignore C? Thanks Edit: One more question: If the last TD point is level 3 (for example) do i must find back in history other level 3 point in order to create a valid TD line...meaning we are not allowed overlapping of levels. If my last TD point is level 1 .. i must find back level 1 to connect it. If my last TD point is level 2 .. i must find back level 2 to connect it. Please can someone clear this

--- 帖子 #274 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I'm not sure what you are asking in the last part of your question. The Main thing to know and Always respect, is that Trend Lines should Never be used in isolation. In other words we always need to be aware of other levels of S/R, Supply/Demand, Daily, Weekly, Monthly Hi/Lows. In my opinion, the ABC set up you're talking about; • Once the candle has close about the B point, that Trend Line is broken. This usually means TL 'A to B' is no longer valid.* ..............* This example is what I consider an exception to what I just said. Red arrow shows price respecting TL extension. • In this case the new Swing at point 'C' does come into play and creates new TL which seems to have a near perfect effect on price. ................- TL rejects price for 5 full M15 candle before breaking through, and then price takes off with great strength. Hope this helps, Darryl

--- 帖子 #275 ---
This is incorrect. TD Supply and Demand lines (plus using the qualifiers) are designed to be objective and can be used in isloation. He recommends his other techniques for entry/exit and if you like as additional confirmation but it is not neccessary if you prefer not to.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks for your opinion.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Not mine. From Tom DeMark's three books.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So you have no opinion? You would just take any TL break?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I use them as DeMark recommends. So I guess you can say my opinion is the same so then yes you could say I have an opinion. If a TL is qualified I enter (if it isn't I fade) anticipated breakout direction regardless of what is happening on another timeframe. If Seq or another of his techniques are present at that time the better. But TD TL's work standalone satisfactory.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi SunTrader, Do you use others indicators together with TDTL ? And If yes, what settings ? Regards,

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I use Seq, Combo, Pressure, REI and many others, all default settings.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Thanks to all the contributors. Trading should be simple and trend lines are widely used. If applied correctly, may be very profitable indeed.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I have put this indicator in my indicators folder of mt4 but it doesnt work. can anone help pls?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Here's a cool video that combines the Combo Countdown with Market Profile: Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Listen to it carefully. He refers to Coma or some such name, not Combo, because DeMark has a trademark on the name. He also says his 9 and 13 count, 4 bar look-back etc. Plain rip off. Btw if coded correctly, which it isn't, it should have recycled the count. Other than that some might find it interesting to use with MP. But it can be used with many others trend reversal techniques too. Or just by itself.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi amgm2609, Could you kindly post TRIX_MTF_Actual (Period D1) indicator. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
SunTrader, Would like very much to know what you think about this signal... Though it's a qualified break, with profit targets being as they are, very close to break, showing little downside potential(only the most extreme target is in play), would you just pass and wait for another set up??????

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Chart doesn't show what symbol or timeframe? But in any case I would pass if you didn't get in right after break. I use TD Trendlines as a trend reversal signal and only look at target lines as an indication. I also don't use R/R whatsoever in my trading. I look for other confirmation a potential move is underway and use trailing stops to stay in as long as move goes in the expected direction.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
SunTrader, thanks for the quick, and informative response. The pair is Aud/Usd. TF, D1. I trade short only when price is below Chandelier, long above. Chandelier also serves as my trailing stop... I, like you, trail as long as price is moving in the expected direction. In addition to Chandelier, I typically have 3 iterations of TickVolumeIndicator on my charts to show buying/selling pressure... 6,12, and 18 period lookbacks. I tend not to take a trade against 2/3 TVI consensus. Again, same chart with full compliment of the tools I use. You are welcome to all, or any!! Will you explain what you mean when you say you only look at target lines as an indication?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Thanks but I use TradeStation and Dynamic trader so MT is not compatible. And as far as target lines - just for an idea of levels price might reach but only within my trade plan. I think I might have mentioned way back I use TD Trendlines with other TD techniques (such as TD Sequential, TD Pressure, TD Differential) so with these try to grab a reversal - which many times go beyond these levels.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Understood... My filters, Chandelier, and TVIs work nicely along with TD TLs.... I suspect, however, that Demark's indys (Sequential, etc....) are superior. Very glad you share your experience. Bolsters my confidence in my tools, and in my trading tactics. Many green pips......... Pippo

--- 帖子 #292 ---
DeMark &amp; Fib's both pointing to 1244 at present. Love it when DeMarks &amp; Fib's agree &amp; when I get Double DeMark confirmation of a target.......

Aud/Usd...... Speed bump at 0.9550 on the way to 0.9585............

Kiwi Oz , you Welcome, I will post Those Demark links here too, I guess it should be here. I had a lot of watchers coming to my blog after i posted it in Gold Thread... I will see what I can find more. Tom Demark methodology video clips.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Thanks mate. Nice to come across a fellow DEMark enthusiast. Wow you really are into your blog. Are you a tech' nut or what.Lol. cheers.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I am not really Demark follower but after discussion about it on Gold thread. ... , i decided to educate myself more. If I find something good on internet, i post it on my blog. If it is useful to me, why not share with others.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
hey...can someone help me with something. I'm new to Demark and have been trying to set up his trendlines properly but I come into one big problem...it seems the trendlines changes very frequently. I'll draw a trendline (I only use level 2) and several candles later I get another trendline...when the market is slow I get some TD points that I don't feel are very strong points. Is there a rule that helps eliminate some of the noise? Second, how do you identify a bounce. If a qualifier states that in order to break a demand line the previous candle must close higher than the open wouldnt that be a bounce signal close to the trendline?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Good on you. If I could vouch for you I would.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I have been using the DeMark system for several years. NOT the indicators. The manual system. Takes a while to get the hang of it but works well for me now. Go to my user name &amp; search my posts for files I have posted.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Yes look at a higher timeframe. At least 60 minute bars, if not 4H. To your question about bounce I'm not exactly what you mean; but here is a EURUSD daily chart with a probable (?) TD Demand line. If the bar closes today as it is exactly shown then yesterday's low is a TD Point 1 matching up with the previous TD Point and the trendline is valid. As well today's close would be an up close. So if tomorrow were to break below the TD Demand line this short entry would qualify. BTW if you want to learn Tom DeMark trendlines stick to what he says . There is plenty on the web - do a search. Pick up one of his three books or better yet as DeMark is sometimes hard to understand without reading and re-reading buy a book called DeMark Indicators by Jason Perl as he is a lot more clear and concise. HTH

I would not write that ugly inverted HnS off yet. The ugly duckling could turn into a beautiful swan.. I have been watching this for a day or two now. Another fall to 1264 would complete the inverted H n S then we ride on up to 1303 &amp; maybe on to 1322..... Be interesting to see if this plays out.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Goes to show. the system works. Just gotta get the direction right.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Minimum target for the Ozzie is 0.97............ http://www.dailyfx.com/forex_forum/i...ilies/cool.png Soft target at 0.9716 is only the 50% Fib' retrace.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
All targets hit &amp; now we may have divergence.?? Time to go Short.?? Note for DEMark enthusiasts. Note how there are two ways to find targets &amp; how target lines later become support lines. Note for DeMark fanatics.....I have developed my own way of using this system. So just ignore my posts if they get your knickers in a twist......Cheers

--- 帖子 #306 ---
So long as we don't go above 1323, there may be a speed bump at 1307 &amp; major support at 1288...Above 1323 &amp; we will have to seek targets to the North. 5 min chart..........

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Take a look at the weekly chart channel. Not convinced of a strong move North yet....Cheers.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
kiwioz, please kindly state each and every line functions. The Demark line, projection etc. Those vertical and horizontal blue line are what?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
The blue lines are the price projections both north &amp; south. Even if you are convinced of the direction it pays to know where it will go if it turns &amp; heads the other way. You need to study the PDFs I have posted before to understand why the lines are drawn in this way.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
please try and check your first support point http://i.imgur.com/9GsJybd.png

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Well spotted &amp; shows you have read &amp; understood the PDFs. However as you state, this is a Weekly chart. I have found there are more ways to use this system than those stated in the PDFs. The DeMark PDFs are a necessary tool in understanding the system in general. As the weeks go by you will find more points to draw from on the weekly chart. This system is best used on the 4H chart for Trend trading. It can also be used equally effectively on all time frames once you get to know how to adapt it to those other time frames. Takes time &amp; practice....cheers.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Gold. HnS looks about complete...Target lines &amp; Fib's agree on 1288.......

DeMark files for those who sent messages asking for them

Now here is something for DeMarkers' to ponder. Talk about going to the extreme target.

Get ready Neddy. 1266 is calling............

Hi Diamonddbw, Thank you for your info Can you tell us what is the volume indicator and platform you use in this picture? thank you so much!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I was little playing with a back test tool and gave little attention to DeMark Trend Lines as well... I played with the daily TF data of 2012 for many forex pairs and only with long trades... Some other stuff EMA(7)&gt;EMA(13) Open Long TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.07 RSI(14) up in last 3 days &amp; RSI&lt;70 &amp; RSI&gt;50 TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.05 PSAR buy signal TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor : 0.98 DeMark Level 1 Upside Breakout TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.24 Winners : %56 958 Trades Level 1 Upside Breakout Qualifier 1 met TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.17 Winners : %54 391 Trades Level 1 Upside Breakout Qualifier 2 met TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.13 Winners : %54 84 Trades Level 1 Upside Breakout Qualifier 3 met TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.25 Winners : %56 659 Trades Level 2 Upside Breakout TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.16 Winners : %54 724 Trades Level 2 Upside Breakout Qualifier 1 met TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 0.98 Winners : %50 253 Trades Level 2 Upside Breakout Qualifier 2 met TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.03 Winners : %51 37 Trades Level 2 Upside Breakout Qualifier 3 met TP: 1 ATR SL: 1 ATR Profit Factor: 1.10 Winners : %53 457 Trades Limits I was unable to test profit targets based on DeMark rules and only used fixed targets Limited time period and only long trades are used Findings It is obvious that DeMark lines has potential to create positive expectation Qualifiers may not be as helpful as he expected As he recommended Level 1 B/O are more profitable Not look like holy grail but I liked the results

hi all ... any one have tomdemark-semaphore indicator.. which is so good

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi guys. I think TD trendlines can be quite useful after some some consolidation. But i think that it can have many fake breakouts. So i don't think this system is 70% as claimed. Or maybe i am just using it wrongly. Any similar experience?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hello, I need some assistance understanding a point in Thomas Demark's trendline trading system as I have been reading his book and there is a point that I need some clarification on. So is there anyone who read any of his books if so, please help me understand the below point it will be really appreciated as I understand he mentioned that when a contradictory breakout out happens, the active TD line and its price objective should be ignored and the new breakout out should cancel the previously active one and the new breakout should take its place as it should be considered as the prevailing trend. now, this point if I understand it correctly I find it confusing since by this he assumes that the price should go straight to its price objective after the breakout without any retracement which may cause “contradictory breakout” considering this recent breakout as a trend reversal. and how would that be possible for the trend following trading? noting that he introduced TD Line cancellation for trend followers Thanks

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hello, everyone! Please someone should assist me in adding a sound alert, arrow and target line to this version of MT5 DEMARKER trend line whenever price break the trend line? I will be very grateful.. Thanks
