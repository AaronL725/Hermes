Hi One and all (rules updated) This is a great system - the 1-2-3 - break system. I trade the eurusd on the 5 mins charts with 3 Ema 5,30,100. on other pairs I trade on the hour, 4 hour &amp; day chart ( I trade mostly on the hour - and confirm with the day) The 30ema &amp; 100ema act as trend &amp; channel... and keep me trading on the right side (hopefully!?) ie green (30ema) over red (100ema) only in an up trend price cannot be between the green (30ema) over red (100ema), ever when I trade. price &amp; the 5 ema (yellow) must be over or under the two Higher emas The 5ema acts like momentum and/or a bird dog - Again price MUST BE OVER the 5 ema in an up trend Attached Image (click to enlarge) But these are only the bit player the real deal is the 1.2.3 break Attached Image (click to enlarge) As all ways (in an up trend) The "100 fibb" (2 pips over) is the entery point The "0 Fibb" (2 pips below) is the SL ***Target : the "400 fibb" (2 pips under) (4.236 fibb works great) RRR 3 to 1 I do keep an eye out for the 50 &amp; 100 points on the chart &amp; will use them if they are close to fib as targets. I find on the 5 min chart you have lots of trades. You will have loss but I find I win well over 80%. Only trade then the 3 ema are stacked in the right other and price is in the right place to them. best if you have some angle on the 30 &amp; 100 ema &amp; its great if they are pulling a part ie. the 30ema is running away from the 100 ema *** its best when the 5 ema is coming of the channel from between the two. ( see blue box below this is great set up) Attached Image (click to enlarge) trade when you have volume &amp; trust the "fibbs" they work it is really best to set and forget &amp; leave the room and let price wonder to your target I use the Fractals to help with the 1.2.3 set-ups but you don't need them its that simple cheers The real TEB63

I forgot Its really easy to see consolidation patterns on the 5 min chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) Blue boxes are the the moves The Yellow is the consolidation patterns, its a rest before the next move. 80-90% you will see price move like this. Use the "fibbs" the same way as in the past post its easy money. Cheers TEB

Teb, I trade something similiar right now. Just curious, how many trades did you have on Friday, and what hours do you trade? Sentinel

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I did a lot, because, sad to say it was a very easy day to trade with what was happen in the USA. I don't think it was a normal day esp. not a normal Friday I traded all day right up to about 3:50pm when Oanda changed their spreds. What system are you using please share Cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Great set-up Attached Image (click to enlarge) I don't wait for the candle to close. If it breaks 2 or 3 pips I am in. TEB

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi Guys Here is an advance trade on this stsyem I sometimes use. I only use it when there is a very clear 1.2.3 And a big big hump in price. I get in on the break of the organge line 4a you get more pips the waiting for 4b (the bigger the hump the more the pips) but you will have more losses as well...but you are also closer to the SL. Again its two or three pips over &amp; I am in. not the close of the candle The big hump is what makes it worth the risk Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers And bye for now TEB

Hi TEB63, You did not state the TF use.So can u pls say something about the TF. Thanks for sharing, God bless. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
There was one last trade last night (I missed it) but it was a great hit on Target one &amp; two pips on target two -- that is on the SL as price dropped. If you used the system. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And that is that on that set of trades cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #17 ---
You don't need it to trade with . I just like to keep an eye on the bigger trend that is all. I do feel better about trades if price is over/under the 3 MA on the 30 min chart the same way as the trade on the 5 mins chart And better still if they are stacked Of And I love it when we are in the 1.2.3 target range on the 30 min !!! trading on the 5 min!!

Hi Teb, Looks very good mate, am trying this out. I have come across a thingy tho - not sure if you've mentioned it or not. But say your looking to go long. You have a 1 and then a 2 and then the 3 is lower than the one. Is this a problem? Do you we still buy on the 2? I have attached a picture so you can see what I'm talking about Cheers, VB,

--- 帖子 #20 ---
No never it has to be higher... in this case ( if you are wanting price to go higher) TEB

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks for the quick response, Cheers,

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Teb, Thank you for sharing your system. Could you please suggest settings of EMAs, Fibs, SL, and TP levels for higher TFs like 4H, D1, &amp; W1? Thank you Alfa99

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Teb, Thanks for these very nice illustrations, I've enjoyed studying them closely. One thing I was not clear on was your criteria for choosing which swing hi to swing lo (or vice versa) to draw the fib projection from, especially in an extended trending run. It seems like where your targets would be would very much be dependent upon the two end points you choose for the fib. Do you look for some criteria, like draw the fib (in an uptrend) from the first swing low after the cross of one of the EMAs? Or something else? Thx, R

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi TEB, Could you attach fractal indicator are used by you ? Thanks for your help. Viatoris

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Viatoris, the fractal indicator is available in the standard MT4 package. Choose the Indicator button to get the dropdown list and look under the Bill Williams collection. Regards, R.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi, TEB! I don t understand why don t You use the earlier fractal (high of the black bar) as Your point 2 on this picture (and 2 fractals earlier point 3, too). MAs looks good there, too? Am I missing something? THX, NL

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi TEB, i had wanted to ask the above question too. Thanks. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi TEB, ema setting pls.... is it close or open or what? Thanks. Nerry.

What a wild day Attached Image (click to enlarge) TEB

--- 帖子 #33 ---
No you just about have it the targets are the 200% &amp; 300% "fibbs" (of course they are not real fibbs) the fibs are in play when ever, But always with the trend but I will not get into a trade unless price is over the stacked EMA I hope you understand what I am saying Attached Image (click to enlarge) see the yellow box price breaks the "point 2" but see how the 3 MA are stacked in order? cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #34 ---
200ema or 50 ema WSS (200ema) was an other thread I had going SL &amp; TP I always use the same ones see the 1.2.3 ebook at the start of this thread as for other FIBBS I never use them I use the Fibb tool but use non fibbs 0,50,100,200,300,400 TEB

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi TEB, The Fib is very important in this system as you have clearly stated, so what is the criteria for drawing the fib. I mean how do you determine the point to which you draw to get the fib level. Thanks. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thanks for sharing TEB, and welcome back havent seen you around recently... Nerry - check out the thread the Worlds Simpliest System by TEB - there are many similaritys and it can answers your questions about fibs

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I like to see what is going on on in the 30 min chart because it give a bigger picture like here Attached Image (click to enlarge) I missed the better trade in the yellow box but I got the second trade. But see how we are in a 1.12.3 on the 30min chart more powerful then just the 5 min chart TEB

Nice system you got TEB.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
this may be a dumb question but........ how do you get the fibbs for 200 and 300 when i use the fib tool it gives me all the default fibbs. i see where you are getting the 0 and the 100 for entry and sl but how are you getting the 200 and 300 what settings do i need to change?? thanks

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Click on the fib line to bring up properties - then you can adjust the %'s to whatever you want.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
but when i do this it doesn't change the level. if i delete all the default levels and add 200 and 300 it wants to know the level. i dont know the values of these levels

--- 帖子 #47 ---
When adding the levels add 2 and 3 and for description 200 and 300 resp hop this will do the trick

--- 帖子 #48 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hallo - I have a question: Is that a good 1-2-3 setup? The problem for me is, that the lows in point 2 are on one line - there is not a higher low.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I'm trading it live! Maybe you should call your 'Fibbs' " Phibs" since they don't fib like the regular Fibs do!

Sorry, hope I did not offend, but i did not know how else to express myself Once i applied your rules, and the trade unfolded as explained - it amaized me.

no I am ok!!! it always works... its the 1.2.3 system that is the heart -- it is the strongest sign teb

1. news I don't trade with this system 2. 1.2.3 patterns are set up by the ema you see what is happening if they are stacked &amp; space between them there might be a good move but if they get tight there will be a good move also 80% of the time the same way as the trend before teb

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi Folks, I must commend TEB for this wonderful system. It has freally improved my earnings. I made $1200 today with it. However, I am finding it difficult putting the customized fibs of 100, 200, 300 on my chart. I know someone has tried to explain how to do it, but all my efforts so far has remained unsuccessful. Can someone please help me with this? Thanks

Adros Add the Fibs to the chart - right click or ctrl b and open the objects list Find the object 'fibo', click edit, then 'add' in level 1 which is equal to = 100% - so put 100% in the discription and keep adding for the levels you want. It should then stay as the default Fib setting for future use Red

the 5ema is almost the same as the normal momentun so on the 5 min we use 5 ema as the base we want the 30 min time frame which is 30 ema and we want a higher time frame say 2 hours 120 ema (some times I use 100ema) day is 5ema base, 20ema for a week, 80 ema for a month 1 min is 5ema , 5 mins is 25 ema , 20mins is 100 ema (150ema would be 30 mins &amp; 75ema would be 15 mins if you like them better) 1 hour is 5ema, 4 hour is 20 ema ,day is 120ema (sometimes I use 100 ema) etc teb

Hi Teb, Nice methodology! It reminds me somewhat of Bill Williams "Trading Chaos" approach to Fractal breakout trading, different moving averages of course, but similar in initail opening of a trade and subsequent add ons. Powerfull stuff. Thanks for the additional insights and your generosity of sharing. P.S. You may find the thread, Chaos Trading System by Starskovsky of interest here on Forex Factory.

Hi TEB Thanks for this trading method. I had a small winning trade this morning and it was the first winner in a long time. It helps with the confidence. I like your style a lot and it appeals to me. I notice that you trade on a demo. Do you only demo trade or have you used this method on live accounts? My win this morning was on a live account, yipee. farimir

Hi TEB, First of all i would like to thank you on this amazing and powerful system. I have seen the 123 system long time back but i didn't care about it. In fact i was searching for such a reliable system for a long time and i think i have found it now. I'm going to demo trade until end of this year. Today i have taken three trades: GBP/USD ==&gt; went long at 1.5812 and closed at 100% 1.5865 (+53 pips). AUD/USD ==&gt; Long at 0.6770 TP 0.6824 (8 pips to reach target).

I personally find the Fibbs I use better &amp; simpler but if your work for you great. But it might get a little hard with two sets of fibbs running around the same thread. To win in the 4X you only need 1 set -up 1. A trend -- The 3 EMA 2. A tool -- The Fractals 3. A trigger -- 1.2.3 break 4. A target-- TEB Fibbs you are using a diff. set-up &amp; that is likely ok but not the one I am using that is all. cheers TEB

TEB, do you have like 100 systems?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
well it does look good doesn't it but really they are basically all the same system 3 times frames one tool &amp; 1.2.3 break there the 3 times frames are seen in the 3 EMA which is the tool that is all I am also keeping an eye on the one chart here mainly for the big "D" with the RSI that is the "little" diff on this system cheers teb

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Why loser? Not reached the 0 line ,yet. Or changed the rules? THX, NL

--- 帖子 #182 ---
no I was using the "3" not the base line which is the "1" did I change that opps ...sorry.. I might use either one in fact ... in a tight market I always use the "3" in a wild market I sometimes use the "1" (I like to give it about 25-30 pips with the Eur) if "3" is to close... but I normally still move it up to "3" I hate losing pips I hope that makes sence cheers teb

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi one and all is anyone else trading this system? and how are you doing? cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I like the simpicity of the system but i'm going to test on larger time frame (daily), do i hv to make changes to the indicator and such, thanks

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi TEB, Not doing much trading with this yet but I like the format and am looking at possibilities. Have a couple of questions though. On the pdf you posted about 1-2-3's, the author clearly looks for major trend reversals with that pattern. With the 5 min chart that isn't going to happen but do you ever trade against the ema's? From what I have seen there are many more opportunities if you allow yourself to do so. Otherwise are you just using the 1-2-3 as an entry point into the trend defined by the ema's. Secondly, do you only use the swing points defined by the fractals as those valid for the 1-2-3 pattern? Again if you are more flexible there are many more. I'm not suggesting that you should make any changes but just trying to get an understanding of what you are looking at. Keep posting. G-Man

--- 帖子 #186 ---
OK.THX, TEB! It lifts Your R:R, but push down Your hit rate... You think Your expectancy is better, now, or just psychologically easier to trade on this way? NL

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I've spent the better part of the night reading this post. I've come to understand your system pretty intimately tonight and I am going to start using it. While reading I've put it up against a couple different trades and they've came out very well! I do have a couple of questions. Hopefully you can find the time to answer them. How long are you typically in a trade from start to finish with this system? Any estimates on success rate with this system? I don't quite understand how you lost this trade and what you were saying here. Are you talking about your S/L here? Thanks a ton in advance, Eddie

--- 帖子 #188 ---
always base it on the 5 ems 5 = day 25= week 100 = month cheers &amp; let be know how you do teb

--- 帖子 #189 ---
yes teb

--- 帖子 #190 ---
yes to both teb

--- 帖子 #191 ---
1. I always trade this system with the EMA 2. I use the fractals to help me but I pick the 1.2.3 points .. some times I use point (esp point "3"), that the Factals don't call 3. 1.2.3 is the main way I trade I will trade a good tri-angle break or a pen bar ( lost a trade last night with this) teb

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Your 1st lot SL is at 0 - 2pips and your 2nd lot is at 0 + 2 pips, so you are only moving it up 3 pips correct?

Hi Good system...simple and nice Just took a trade...target coinciding with the 4 hour trendline...so good chances for the trade to hit the fib 200...

Attached Image (click to enlarge) good day but a hard day just over 300 pips for the day how did everyone else do? chers TEB

--- 帖子 #203 ---
How many trades did you do ?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi TEB, it is a little bit difficult for me to see wich Hi and wich Lo you mark with your Fibo. (You can maybe use the dotted line of the Fibo to mark them) Is it important how long ago the different EMAs ordered each other in the right order ? I am beginnner, so do not wonder about my questions.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Ah i now see in the further posts and can answer one of the questions. Is it important how long ago the different EMAs ordered each other in the right order ? No its not !

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) perfict hit this late in the day I only do target one ( infact i had 2 targets but the 1st one was the 1.2800) 15 pips &amp; 68 pips cheers teb

--- 帖子 #207 ---
?? not sure what you mean you do want them stacked price over 5ema over 30ema over 100ema for a buy sell opp. cheers teb

--- 帖子 #208 ---
10 sort of... I may have added to trades 8 winners two losers at the time you asked 1 sence cheers teb

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Yes they should be stacked in the right order. it is not important how long ago they were stacked. 5 minutes or 5h.. if they are stacked, they are stacked.... then its possible to enter a trade in the right direction...

--- 帖子 #210 ---
ok yes but its better if the the yellow comes out from between the two if its been up a long time it may turn on you this is more of a problem on the higher TF be honest this is where the hour chart comes in to see what the longer term is doing. ie. channels or 1.2.3 or triangles etc. it cheers teb

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I don't trade NFP which is less then an hour now What does this mean Teb and what hours do you like to trade with this system (gmt) Many thanks juls.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
once a month is non-farm pay roll on a friday am its a crazy thing but in the USA people have partys &amp; bet on it they get hotel rooms &amp; drink beers all night and try to win the lottery NFP anyways the big boys swing price both ways &amp; then some so its crazy &amp; I stay away from it because its the best place to lose a lot of money fast. as for trading times I do NY time I do &amp; late London some times Asia 1pm-7pm EST is about the worst time But its London not NY that runs the 4X so 3am - 5am est is the easist time to trade but its the middle of the night for me cheers teb

--- 帖子 #213 ---
easy question: What is 4x ? Thx.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
4X = FOREX.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Gi day there Teb. Discovered your thread yesterday, read thru it &amp; entered my first trade. A loser I`m afraid. Can you tell me if the entry was correct &amp; just bad luck.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Why dont you use the 0 100 200 300 marker for the picture ?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I entered 2 pips below the intraday low, 1.4787. Which is the 100% fib. I have been using these fibs on another type of trading but basically they are the same as Tebs. The T3 is 200%, T5 - 300%.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
What time was your entry? G-Man

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I think TEB prefers strong trends. The EMA40 is flat in M30. (not good) The price is not nicely under the EMA9 in M30. There is also the daylow wich is a resistence for your short. Lets see what TEB is saying after he woke up Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #220 ---
On my charts it was 8.15am, New York time 1.15am

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Well I think its not always the same way he searches for trends in the upper timeframes. But one of them...

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Tell me if I'm right here? On my M5 I have EMA's 5,30,100 On an M30 do I need the same indicators? Currently am in a short of EUR/USD! Looks like I may have made the right trade! If so this system is awesome and it appears to be more accurate than other systems I've been testing.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I am also short at the EURUSD (but im M30 the ema40 is not down) , i am not sure what TEB is thinking about daylows.... (for m30 please read my post with the picture above)

--- 帖子 #225 ---
How are you feeling about the trade? I'm not used to holding on to positions this long but I feel much more confident trading this system...which according to all laws...is a good thing! So 9 and 40 on 30 minutes? I'm still kind of lost on that and could use a little direction on that.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
if the candles keep red i am feeling good but it is not really breaking the 123

--- 帖子 #227 ---
It's starting to get painful hahaha...good thing I'm demoing!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Does anyone know how to open 2 positions in MT4 easyly ?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Do you mean 2 positions the same. If you do trade 2 lots then when you want to exit only 1 lot, just go to close order &amp; select 1 lot only. This will close 1 lot &amp; leave the other going.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Ah yes thats true, but i cannot set 2 different targets...

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Couldn't you just adjust your remaining position after you've closed the first one?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
But the problem is that i have then to close my position manually. Sometimes that is really stressful, and you also have to sit there.... I need to write an EA for doing it all automatic

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) both targets slow night teb

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Another try, 2nd pos was stopped out...

--- 帖子 #235 ---
The problem is to know if its up or down from now on, also yesterday...

--- 帖子 #236 ---
yes it was not a good day for this system the markets had no trend (a little at the start of theday &amp; at the end) keep an eye on the eur/usd if its not trending likely nothing else will as that is where most of the money is. if this is the case you need to move to a Higher TF &amp;/or higher EMA I moved to 200ema on the 4 hour/ hour/15 mins (WSS) also fridays are hard &amp; mondays too monday morning people are setting the trend fridays afternoon people are taking money out A good times to loss money But anytime between 1pm &amp; 7pm est is bad trading just too few people in the markets cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi TEB I can see the Fib line drawn in the chart can you explain how you do this 0 to 200

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Thank you TEB ! Anyone knows what WSS means ? Thx.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
It is always the same question The FIBlines 0 100 200 300 mean only that their distance is equidistant . You can edit the Fibos in MT4 under FIBO properties / Levels with right mousebutton.

Please include me. What are the 3 systems that you are using? This is my first post but wanted to let you know that I have been following your threads for some time. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi Guys, I've developed an indicator to visually identify the 123 setup . This is version 1 and it includes whatever is my understanding of TEB's methodologies. It draws a line between point 1 and point 2 and another line between point 2 and point 3 . Also draws the entry line. The lines alternate between DASH and SOLID so as to not confuse two consequetive setups. EDIT: Found an issue where some long 123 setups not displayed. fixed it.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi cheelu, Thanks, have installed it and it looks great.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
How to install it if there is no Source ? Drop the file into the experts/indicator directory and then ?

What about this one?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
looks ok, maybe TEB knows a better answer...

--- 帖子 #259 ---
looks fine... but put the 1 hour on as well put a 5 ems on it &amp; look at the last hour candle and the one on now look at the RSI on the Hour make sure you are not over buy/sold or have the BIG "D" happening then put on the trade &amp; your winning will be higher you don't need it but it helps. This is a great systen in a strong trend ... other wise you may get killed the market is not trending right now use the WWS I am cheers teb

--- 帖子 #260 ---
1 Pos first Target hit 2 Pos BE+2 Where should be the RSI TEB ?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1. The white boxes show about the same area on both chart 2. The big black lines on the hour... you want going the same way... if not don't trade. 3. The RSI is not over bought/or sold 4. also as a conformation a.the rsi is raising b. Has punched over ther 50% . 5. it hard to tell here but you do want the candle &amp; candle formations in the right way 6. price must be over the 5 (in fact it would) tebr

Hi harigp, do you have any stopps ? is this a system ?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yes I do have I am using the concept in the first post and 50 % of my trade I close using the fibo line and the balance 50% I go BE In the case of EU/AU trade I booked the contract before the closing of us seesion and frankly i let it run during the night. I enter for trade using EMA 5,EMA 30 and EMA 100 principle said in the first post If you have any suggestion pls let me know and I can take care more on my exit strategey etc

--- 帖子 #278 ---
HI Harigp, if you post charts please draw in the stop, target, entry .....

--- 帖子 #279 ---
ok done for future charts

--- 帖子 #280 ---
For this thread If you are trading 1. remember its friday 2. the Eur/usd is at a major fork in the road the 4 hour channel will break or hold either way it will have a major effect on the other currances . you might get blind sided on a 5 min chart .. even an hour might be small so keep your stops tight so it could be an interesting day with this system cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi TEB, so you think the bigger trend in EURUSD and cable is down, we should be careful in trading longs ?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
eur/usd yes I put some stuff on the WSS thread on it cheers teb

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Here's one that just triggered on the eur/usd. The 4 hour trendline may be a problem as Teb pointed out. Thanks for the system Teb. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Took profit on 1/3 of the position at 1.2635 and moved the stoploss up under point three of the 1-2-3 pattern.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I closed the rest out at 1.2616 due to the stalling at the 4 hour trendline. Thanks again Teb. Take care, Dave http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi harigp! I see you entered at 1.2455. Shouldn't you wait till PA was above EMA100 (considering 123break system, of course)? Your trade was much more profitable but I am not sure you followed the "rules"... ;-) Do you use an improved method? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hello TEB63 and others, Been trading this a bit...It's simple and is a no-lag system based on price action. Interesting for sure. I'm attaching a chart...Is this approximately how you guys would have played this pair. Am I correct to assume that the pullback should came at lease to the 50 fib? These 1-2-3 patterns are everywhere...how do you decide from the good and the not-so-good. Or should I read the thread from the start to get it. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #288 ---
hi CanuckCT Yes you should read the thread and the "World simplest system" thread from TEB63 from its beginning. The thing is of course the main trend of the upper timeframes. It should be in the same direction. How to know this look in the threads, or you simply can find a different method..... many things should be ok...

--- 帖子 #289 ---
sure I will be back to normal next week sometime if you like fire me off a email to teb63@live.com cheers teb http://www.forexfactory.com/images/misc/progress.gif

--- 帖子 #295 ---
In my trades there is always something on the way.... Daylow Trendline Roundnumber Teb what to do because auf this ? Thank you for all !

--- 帖子 #296 ---
That is trading its a # &amp; % game you have to know people are watching all those things &amp; more when the majority of people "see" its up they buy &amp; up she goes its that simple ( well not quite you do have news &amp; Fundy things happening) cheers Teb

--- 帖子 #297 ---
[quote=TEB63;2375696]That is trading its a # &amp; % game Yes I know, but how to decide what is important and what not ? Do you remember all these things ? Or do you have a policy to say it is a trade or not ? On the first view your method has SL = Target1. For example for a long SL = 60 in GBPUSD: entry is 2 (break 123) + 4 (spread) and round number 40 away =&gt; target1 = 40-6-4 = 30 but SL is 60+2 = 62. That means that the target in average is much less then the stop. Is there any formular wich keeps you away from trading ?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
[quote=oechel;2375842] but that true of only 1/2 my trade remembler I go for targer 2 as well so I am well over 1 to 1 also I do move up the SL as soon as I can so again my wins are bigger then my loses I do use "00" numbers as SL &amp; Targets &amp; lows &amp; highs as well. you have to see what is going on in the market move up one time frame &amp; take a look do you have a lot of space at the top or are you close to it. if you are close ... a big choice will need to be made break or bounce right cheers teb

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi I wrote a skript, it helps to post charts. Do the following: 1 Install the skript. 2 Make a hotkey with leftclick onto the skript 3 Place a fibo onto the chart 4 Rename the Fibo into "teb" 5 click the hotkey to start the skript What you get: You will get the colored lines as in my last post. You can change the lines because of round numbers etc. You can read the places of Entry, Stop, Target1, Target2 for your orders. Others as well can read the values onto your screenshots.... After you installed it like above its only: 1 move the fibo 2 press the hotkey 3 fun

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi, I have been on this thread for awhile. Now I am trading this method live. Is TEB still using this method or the WSS one? Which method do you think is better or rather, when to use this method as compared to WSS.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
WSS is my main system always I use this one when we have a stong trend!! cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi, How will we know if there is a sudden change in the short term trend. When there is a 123 break on the 15 min which has broken the trend as dictated by 1h and 4h. But ended up as a failed trade and the 1h soon also breaks the EMA. I understand that you have said to look at the 4h candle. But what do you do if you encounter this situation? When you thought the 15min chart will go back to the trend but instead the 1h breaks the EMA.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Does the angle of the 200ema matter? Your chart has more than 1 ema, how do you use the other emas? thanks.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi, Eversince TEB said that he is using WSS more, this thread seems to be dead. I feel that this method is much safer than WSS. It has higher success rates for me. The WSS method is much harder. Because the price does not immediately re-cross the 200ema on the smaller TF. So it suffers high drawdowns at time. Correct me TEB, I am having difficulty with WSS. WSS may lead to a change of intermediate trend and as a result trades become losses. While this method works in strong trends. And we are only trading with the strong trends.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Kris I am very glad it is working for you!! I find the WSS much safter .. less draw downs if done right this one I use only in a very strong trends! Its the set ups in the WSS that is so strong! cheers Teb

Thanks for sharing this valuable info and method.I've been working hard to learn all I can and I think my brain got clogged up with all that info, lol. Now I'm looking at some simple methods and making good pips. Yesterday was a crazy day, I was up about 250 pips but got caught on a few bad 1's but closed the day out with a profit of 9 pips. Still I made a little and was happy to have that little bit. Could have been a lot worse. Hoping everyone makes happy pips and has a good time doing it

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Yeah GOOD system.. Great.. Thanks and thanks Chonchy for tip..

--- 帖子 #319 ---
.........Thanks danc for your kinds words, and I thank fxhermit that guided me to it.......

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I never understand why threads on simple systems like this one never last long. I think its because those who know how to trade - trade something like this and those who do not know how to trade have 100000 tools on there charts! I get pips everyday with this system!!

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Really? I use another system: I t's a point system based on 1. The weekly, daily, 4 hour, 1 hour, 30min, 15 min and 5 min charts 2. I look at news, interest rates differences, cot, trend, swing, candles, how other markets are moving and a few other things. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
lol No I use those to find trend not to trade!( sort of) and I use points only for some system this is a stand alone system oh... there may have been an inside joke in that posting by the way But its not from thread right

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Glad you saw the funny side

EU +21 +10 +17 +4 Thanks Teb, do not know how I missed this thread, must have been the full stops in the thread title, I searched for 123 so 1.2.3 did not show up. Nice 123 method to add to my arsenal of 123 methods. I did not follow your rules entirely, my apologies. First Trade. 123 short from strong resistance area 1.3550, my favorite 123, 2 lots, first target the 300 second target the 400 &amp; BRN 1.3500, first target achieved moved stop to 200. Stopped out at 200. Second Trade. According to Teb´s rules. Safe first target the BRN 1.3500 &amp; 200, last swing down did not reach the BRN so this time the BRN most likely target, second target the 300 at 1.3480. First target achieved moved stop to intermediate Fib 123.8%, the 161% fib was to close to the price. The Pin Bar off support BRN 1.3500 should have told me to close all but I held on, got stopped at 123.8%.

Thanks TEB for sharing this strategy. I'm a complete newbie and have been looking for something exactly like this: a simple system where the basic tools of trend identification, indicator use, Fibos and MM rules go together. There is always more to learn, but in my case, I feel it's high time to actually start executing a trading strategy. I'm bored of just playing around (and getting stopped out without a consistent strategy) and reading completely contradicting opinions in the trading threads.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Wowowoooo it worked great, I messed it up only that I did not know at first how to partially close an order (@200%), so I closed it all. Let this be my greatest concern. So the rules I use so far on M5: - Trend: Alligator's teeth (3xEMA) in order, RSI-14 on the right side of 50, ADX-14&gt;20 - Tool: At first, nothing, how do you exactly use Fractals? - Trigger: 1-2-3 - Stop: under point 1, with 2% risk - Target: close 50% at 200% (move SL to riskless), close rest at 350% What do you think? Is 2% reasonable, or do you use a different rule?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi Danc, I looked at your example at screen, and could not understand...in green boxes you show point 123 to enter. and the entry is followed by trend. But if we look to CCI, it is located in overbought zone and does not recommend to buy. Perhaps its possible to use the strategy without CCI?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
why are you adding things - the reason it works is it is simple!!! add tools and loss pips

--- 帖子 #337 ---
This is virtually identicle to my own system that I completed just this year. I was looking for a simpler way to trade that avoided having to check multiple time frames, C.O.T data, news reports etc to make discretionary decisions on direction and entry but kept me on the right side of the move and trading when momentum is present. Wish I had just read this thread when you first posted it. I use a 2;1 reward/risk instead of your fib targets and longer periods for the ma's but the entry method is the same as are the rules about between the ma's.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
GU(5min)...perhaps a tad contrived but willing to give the short a go, if triggered.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Given time of day, took +24 around the RN, S1 and not far off ADR.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
AU short first to trigger for me this morning... Edit: closed around the RN for +16. Also have an AJ short from 91.92. I love this strat!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
..and closed the AJ short on the S2 bounce for +19.5.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
CJ short, may be the next one for me...could be in the process of rejecting both daily and weekly S1s...tgt likely to be the RN, will hold longer if there's sufficient momentum.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
CJ short lost -10.5 but a UJ short gained +12.2 ...teach me to overtrade.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
easy trade

--- 帖子 #345 ---
wow nice classic TEB63.....

--- 帖子 #346 ---
A Worthy and Simple system. Well done

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Oh yes indeed! I took some ideas out to add for my own system. This is a brilliant approach!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
thanks Zinot other then price action this is a pretty good system teb

--- 帖子 #349 ---
these were the 3 best entries for this system I found - in Candle form - I tend to use Bars more now (these candles are for an up trend) teb

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Dear, The idea to use 5 EMA getting out of the cloud of 30 EMA and 100 EMA as MOMENTUM is excellent. You are brilliant.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
well thanks - lots of work and mistakes; lol I still us the 5MA teb

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Sir i believe that hold strong whatever is working for you. The first post of this thread made in 2008 and its still alive in 2016. It means something. Consistency. This is what is important for any system. I have just read the first few posts of your's. Will definitely, read all the 18 pages.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I did not trade these - but very clear trades on the eurcad 2 trades purple lines - SL are the stops white lines - Entries (bars close over the green 30 ema then under the 5 ema) blue lines - 1st targets red 100 ema and 30 ema green - clearly down yellow ema - we see a clear retracement then break back down the RRR is a little small on both trades

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hey Teb, very nice system, makes perfect sense, need to ask, have you tried it on any other timeframes?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I did - I found 5 min was the best for me

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Is there interest in this system?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Me

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Sir, Plz keep it up. There are many new things in your system. I am reading it in momentum prospective . Thanks for your excellent thoughts.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Do you actively trade this system? I've always been a fan of 123s and Ross hooks but never could make it work for me.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
​sometimes between 4am and 11am if I see a perfect set up l- esp after a news event. its a great system until you understand price action. teb

--- 帖子 #361 ---
here's one trade I took today on aussie dollar...........the magenta colored balls mark highs and lows of the move (123) and that alerts me for possible setup, shorted at the vertical line:

--- 帖子 #362 ---
​good call

--- 帖子 #363 ---
strange: 123 is a reversal pattern

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I thought I posted the entry on this earlier I not sure where it is. I was not planning on trading this today - but nothing on my main trading system and I saw this set up 2 lots - 1st lot at the lid 2nd taken out 2nd one is 1 to 3 RRR but I will watch it I will move my SL to BE as soon as I can

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Only taking a small position - I think we will have a massive reversal soon in the next 3 days

--- 帖子 #366 ---
set ups one win already on the chf

--- 帖子 #367 ---
if you like higher time frames here might be one setting up nicely - I love the volume on it as well

--- 帖子 #368 ---
small trade - great set ups two trades the 2nd one is safer both had two lots 1st PT was the "lip" on both trades 3nd PT is 1 to 3rrr when 1st target was hit I moved stop lose down to BE

--- 帖子 #380 ---
hi Teb, how do you avoid entries such as the one highlighted yellow on the picture attached?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
every trade is not a winner but I would like a little more angle on the 100sma

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Im looking at this tread a year ago and went, four weeks ago I read this again and start trading with, and... I OPEN MY EYES! +45% to my account, Teb! You are the greatest! Many green pips to you and good health!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
glad its working for you I had a good week as well - not 45 % ?! thought this was a death thread no interest teb

--- 帖子 #384 ---
45% in 4 weeks , but that is insane! I wish myself a better understanding of this method and many many good entries

--- 帖子 #385 ---
congrads !!

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Please TEB don't stop posting here! Is many users watching your thread! and I think they start posting too but wants more! keep posting yours trades and examples! See ya!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hope you are having a good weekend! During what sessions do you trade this system? More specific what times? Cheers

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi TEB, What is your main trading system ? Is it VSA ?

--- 帖子 #389 ---
vsa

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Wow. TEB, I just have to say. I read this thread from top to bottom. And the fact that it is surviving till today is a huge testament! What you are doing is fantastic and I GREATLY respect you for that. I have been training for 3 years. But I blew out my account 4 times. I have been using this 123 method for the past 1 month and out of 30 trades, 23 were winners. I will keep working hard on this! Looking forward to more of your posting. Thanks once again TEB!

--- 帖子 #391 ---
First of all , Thank you TEB for a great system and clear/simple explanation . You are great I will, try this strategy in this month ( all June ) on my live account ( opened specially for this system ) and will post right here the results ,along with pictures. I think ,that 123 have a great potential even after all these years . Today's orders : - AUD/USD + 15 Hit first TP ,then moved the rest of orders to the break even,hit BE - USD/CHF +9 / TP1 , +19 / TP2 , +29 / TP3 - EUR/USD + 5 I opened the order but after a few minutes close manually - USD/CAD + 19 / TP1 , +42 / TP2 , +59 / TP3 I am looking for a 123 setup on m5,then I go to the M30 and H1 ,to check the situation, where is the price,check the candles and some channels ,S/R, flags etc.. Below some examples of today's entries / Central European Time Thank you TEB one more time wish to you all nice week

what MAs you are using? what are the rules of entry?

--- 帖子 #411 ---
EMA: 5,30,100 But they are not very important, they show the Trend Direction only.... It is possible to trade without them About Roles read this small thread atb vvm

--- 帖子 #412 ---
123-Reverse-Setup on M5 It was a bit risky to sell this 123 But M30 links has a great bearish PinBar, that shows great Downpressure Therefore I took this Sell but moved SL to BE atb vvm

--- 帖子 #413 ---
why do you sell here? i mean.. yeah thats a 123 pattern,, but the EMAs tells to buy only

--- 帖子 #414 ---
There are 2 Types of 123-Setups: 1. with Trends 2. Reverse Setups In this Fall I saw a Reverse........ There are 2 great Threads here on FF about 123-Systems: 1. 1.2.3. break bacis: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...23-break-bacis 2. How to use the 123 strategy effectively: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...gy-effectively There are 21+85=106 Pages here I love this both Threads There you find all Information about this 2 Setups...
