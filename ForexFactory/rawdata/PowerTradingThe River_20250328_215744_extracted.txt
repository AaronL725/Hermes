PowerTrading/The River Revised rules. PowerTrading is a method I developed to bring together the basic elements of trading and what the knowledge I believe it takes to become a professional or full time trader. I think it is fair to say that I was influenced by many of the best traders and many of the things I usesd have been used by others. The PowerTrading method combines Support and Resistance, Fibonacci, Price Action, Trend Lines and sound Money Management. If you leave out any one of these items you will not be successful. The River Trade is only one aspect and we will use it just for the setup. The old River is just part of our indicator setup and I would never advise taking a trade simply based on a cross. I will attempt to teach you the entire PowerTrading method as we proceed in this thread. Please understand you must practice, and have patience to master the method. PowerTrading/River Trade Currency: I am currently only supporting the GBP/USD, although this method will work well on other pairs. Timeframe: M15 Settings: 1- Envelope 2- 62SMA 1- Create an envelope, period 62, MA method simple, at close, with 0.05 deviation. Upper color: Blue; Lower color: Red 2- Create a 62 SMA at close, and add the levels -30, +30, --60, +60, -90, +90 MA color Black; Level color: Gray Template http://www.divshare.com/download/2724572-c7e FX Sniper http://www.divshare.com/download/2919082-c36 http://www.divshare.com/images/icons/share.gif Entry 1 : Enter upon breaking the zone. It is always better if this falls in the area of a Fib number. Take profit: 1- Use Fibo levels, support and resistance, etc 2- Look for reveral candles and formation. Stop loss: 1- Use Fibo levels, support and resistance, etc 2- Use the other band, if you´re long, set the SL at the lower band, if you´re short set SL at the upper band 3- SL of 50-60PIPs Zone Breakout is a way of consolidate price and identify Support and Resistance. You use a box to set up your zone. This is unlike any other box because it is not based on some arbitrary time but on Price Action and Fibonacci. We attempt to draw the box around price as it is consolidating. We do draw when price is making big moves. Here is an example where the box was drawn between the zero on the Fib swing and 38.2. Notice how priced danced inside area for some time. We keep moving forward and this becomes the zone.

Here is a River move, followed by a reversal. Pips in both directions. PT http://apollo.divshare.com/thumbs/20...547096-ab5.jpg

I have been trading this system since January. April was my best month to date and I was over 1500 pips for the month. I trade this method using fibs and trendlines for entry and exit. There are some basic rules for entry, but when using fibs and trendlines it can alter entry somewhat. For example, the basic entry is after the first candle has been formed outside the envelope (river). Once a candle has been opened and closed on the upper side you would go long and on the lower you would go short. However, if there is a crucial fib or trendline in the path, you could wait for the break of that fib area or trendline before entry. I trade with a group of people and almost everyone is having great success with this method. Not selling anything at all and this method is not mine. It has been traded for years and was made popular by Rob Booker and others. We simply put a little different twist on the trade and made it unique. PT

Long from 4/30, if you took this for the max, it was about 100 Pips. http://apollo.divshare.com/thumbs/20...547221-056.jpg

This is a video explaining how to trade the River trade. It is a pretty big file. There have been some changes to setup since the video, but this will help you understand this trade. PT http://www.divshare.com/download/436759-6f3

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I been follow his post in and other site long time. And he do get out a lot of Trading video have great tips &amp; tricks. And all this for free.He have a big group members in there site. Thank to him Alex

This method is also traded as a 4 hr method and I developed it because it allowed me to trade a few times a month instead of everyday. I call it the River wild and every one of the settings were put in by me based on testing, forward and reverse. I have traded it live for 2 months and it has been very successful. I will post the template and and example but won't post method until we see how the River method is received. PT Template http://www.divshare.com/download/509009-a7c

--- 帖子 #9 ---
The NonLag zig zag is not on the template you posted. Can you post it or direct me on where to get it? Also, I see you have some indicators on your screen shots. Are those in use or just for reference. Thanks for sharing this.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I really don't use that indicator anymore. We had tried it as a guide for some to draw fibs, but drawing off high low swings is better way to do it. The Fx Sniper CCI is available here at FF but I don't know where, but I will try to find it. PT

what kind of player do I need to watch your video? windows media player could not open your file

you have to download the following codec file and then install it http://download.techsmith.com/tscc/tscc.exe Alex

Hi PT Please give me file mt4 for AbsoluteStregthHistogram. Thanks for your help. Core

--- 帖子 #14 ---
the video is fantastic and the river too. I understand... the first candle crossed the river in the open and close, as the signal... but I have seen that the better opportunities are when this happnes but also the close is higher than the open if we are going out the river to the upper side.. (going long) and vice-versa. just wanted to ask Powertrader what do you think of it? is it stronger the candle signal then? also... I like to check the general trend in the 1H or 4H timeframe with trend indicators... then I prefer a river signal in the side of the trend. Let's navigate the river!.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Good observations! The Geppy pays a great interest (swap), therefore the long positions are always a bit stronger but all pairs work better when going with the Trend! Hopefully next week will give us more opportunity to see how well this method sets up. This week, with the market ranging, has been difficult to trade and required great patience. PT

Enjoyed the presentation............ It appears this video originates at a website named: forexsrdc Hmmmmmmmm............srdc............that has a familiar ring...........

No Srdc here. We own that domain but the original participants have long been vanquished. Just where items are stored. PT

PT, Can you elaborate on how you personally use the FX Snipper CCI indicator to trade The River? LH

Hello again, i have only your video about the river concept. Can't find other things on website. Have you got some others ressources speaking about the river ? Thanxs a lot for your answer

Sorry, forgot to attach the chart ... Here's the Usd Cad chart :

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi PT, In order to understand and learn more, could you pls explain why none of the candles that closed above the upper river bank were taken as valid entries? A lot of them closed cleanly outside the river, ie not touching the blue line at all. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
The upper candles are still touching the River. You need to have a candle open and close above or below and then enter on the next candle. I also use time of day to filter out some trades. PT

--- 帖子 #33 ---
PowerTrader, What do u mean by "... I also use time of day to filter out some trades" . btw, thx in advanced ... Happy Investing

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks for the reply PT, I have attached the chart again, and if you have a look at the 3 arrows on the candles, they are not touching the river at all, and also, they are clean candles above the river. Thanks in advance for your reply. Regars, K

--- 帖子 #35 ---
PowerTrader, i attach Gbp Chf chart below. my question is : 1. If the last Candle closed completely below The Lower Envelop (not touch the lower Envelop ), is that a signal for Short ? Happy Investing

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Our breaks have been coming later in the Asian session or in the Euro. It is rare that we get a good break at the beginning of the day GMT.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Kermut, You are correct and will say this falls in the time of day filter. I also like to see some price action. Let me be clear about the River Trade and what I believe on every trade. You must get familiar with this trade. There is no exact formula for entry and exit. You can have 10 people trade this and all will come up with different results. In addition you will take a loss from time to time but if you trade this often your wins will blow the losses out of the water. PT

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Just so you don't think I post all charts after the fact. Look at buy entry on this chart. http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/5725/gepl511ks4.gif

This is the result of the Geppy River trade today. This is a winner. http://apollo.divshare.com/s03/thumb...618955-56b.jpg

--- 帖子 #40 ---
about your stop loss strategy... could it in some way use the other side of the river as SL ? and use 50 pip if river is father that 50 pips?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Yes exactly, the standard stoploss is on the other side of the River. I use that or 60 pips on Geppy, which ever is less. I use no more than 50 on cable. PT

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Any ressources dear PT ?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I'm impressed with what I've seen so far on this method. I do notice that the discussion on the video does focus around very profitable trades rather than areas where price action is "swimming" in and very close to the river... This currency is a good one and I've found statistically you can make more money on this compared to all the others. I personally hate performing manual trades because I'm too emotional and can't be trusted to follow rules - all the time. I'm developing an EA now but I was wondering if anyone had done this already and had results over a decent period of time. Thanks, jamesin.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
PT I have the ea Riverrat LWMA by Bo_Bokus, I run it on a 1hr chart and I have it set on 4 pairs so far its going reasonably well as Iam unable to login to your new site can you tell me if this ea is the latest and am I right to run it on 1hr... I ask as your manual versions run off 15 min and 4hr charts and it seems odd to run the ea off a 1hr.. Is there any updates? Glenn

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I think you have the most recent. I have not used that EA so I am not sure how well it worked. I think in certain markets it was good and not so good in others but I will ask Bo and report back. PT

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Not sure what you are looking for but I will answer any questions you have. PT

--- 帖子 #47 ---
You are correct, the video does center around the better trades. I think if you filter trades by time of day, you can make your EA a winner. I would suggest that no trades are entered until open of European markets and trades do not open after 18:00 GMT. PT

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks PT! A very good suggestion that I will try out. I didn't think of this but the charts certainly back up what you're saying.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I think last night we had a good River trade. I entered long around 238.46 and still holding. What did you guys do?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
keep on hold targeting 240 this week only a breach of 237.70 will change my view ...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Are you still holding this ? PT, can you post your view on this trade ? did you take it or filter it ?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
The markets are ranging so much that it is difficult to trade our normal trades. If not for news, there would have been very little movement in the market. I keep thinking we are going to break out and it must happen some time. Till then, take what you can get. I was able to trade a few reversals yesterday for winners. PT

You can see that the daily range is MUCH bigger over the last 5 or 6 months compared to the previous. I'd suggest it's been much easier to make money over the last 6 months than the half year before that. It's always tempting to see what could have been made and "celebrate" but how good are our crystal balls? Anyway, you can probably see a few trading systems that could come out of these stats. eg. breaks of previous days high, low or early direction set. Enjoy!

Jamesin, I'm a little confused exactly what we are looking at. The statistics are easy enough to follow, but what about the predictions? Are those the backtests of the River Trade over the last few months? Whatever they are, they sure look good. A bad month might give you breakeven, but the good months make it worthwhile. What can you tell use?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi, I wrote this stats EA a while ago so I could some idea on stats that could be relied upon and hence might be useful to eventually earn some money. I'd never looked at the GBPJPY currency pair until I stumbled upon this river section. I had always assumed that the GBPUSD was it and had been put off by the big spread on this currency. (8 pips with www.fxdd.com) . Those stats have got nothing to do with the river trade but I'm happy to explain what they are. The main point I was making by providing these stats is how much more intraday movement we've had over the last 6 months compared to the 6 months prior. 1) High/Low breakout prediction. This is if the current day breaks either the low or the high of the previous day. If for instance the high is broken and it closes above the high, then this is where the prediction was correct. The equivalent for a low is when we break the previous day's low and the close for the current day is below this. The so called "high/low profit" adds up the profit only on those trades that succeeded and is the difference between the previous days high or low (as appropriate) and the close of the current day. Note: inside days would be completely ignored. Also, trades where prediction wasn't correct would incur a loss and this hasn't been taken into account. This could be easily factored in if you chose a worst case stop loss. 2) 26 point movement at 3am (chart time - metratrader) This means if (and only if) at 3am a movement of &gt;= 26 points is achieved relative to the open price for the day, a position is taken out in that direction. (i.e if movement was 30 points upwards from open, then we'd buy, if say 26 points drop from open then we'd sell. Otherwise do nothing) The profits are the measurements of the 3am price and the close, high/low (as appropriate) and the price at 17:00. You can see from this that prediction was reasonable being above 50% and the profit better than using the previous day's high/low breakout. Obviously the profit to the high or low of the day is there for comparison only as it's impossible to say on the day high or low as been reached with certainly until the day is over... You can see that I've tried to "find" the time when the high or low is reached in a day and this was done by averaging the HH:MM:SS for high/lows of each day. I hope this stimulates some thinking and fresh ideas on this whole mystery. At the moment I've just completed an EA do carry out the river trade to the letter for the 15 minute period. I guess the part of the method that wasn't really clear was when to take profit. We know that it's the other side of the "river" for the initial stop loss. You'll be pleased to know that the 0.05 deviation in the MA envelope does give the best results and amazingly the 62 SMA gives the best results for the MA. I used to optimiser to try all other values from 30 to 100. It makes a profit of around $11,000 USD using 1 lot trades from Jan 1, 2007 until now. The strike rate is ordinary to say the least 17% for shorts, 37% for longs and the all important profit factor is 1.22 which is fairly sad. I'm exiting when it crosses the other side of the river. The big challenge for me now is to find some sort of smart trailing stop loss that will give me a large percentage of potential profit. Also, what are some filters to avoid trades altogether that work out unprofitable. Anyone who has some brilliance on this I'd be very happy to hear from!! Jamesin

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi All, I have been working hard trading lately. The River is a great trade and will work in any market but the trending markets are certainly the best. My favorite pair is normally the Gbp/Jpy but the lack of daily range on this pair currently has caused me to trade the Euro/Usd more or the Gbp/Jpy. I will be posting some more charts in the next few days. Once we start trending again, watch out. I am pleased to see all the testing that has been done. PT

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I am waiting for your chart. I added some filters now for 15M to avoid noise. And also testing it on 4H charts with MACD which came from 300 per month thread and also Stoch for 4H timeframe. But your charts are very important for me or maybe you have some updates?

--- 帖子 #59 ---

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I dont know how you trade but i trade too with the rules and only losses how you enter trade what is your rule?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
well bro rules are the same which power trader told us in the first trade read them carefully and u will win rite now i am long in GJ from 240.42 target the uppoer fib 240.90 lets see thanks abid

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I read them many times. Total shit.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hey netwise, congratulations for your winning trades! Can you post your fib indicator? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
as i told above i m long in GJ from 240.42 :d see GJ is up and i close on +50 pips 240.92 heheheheh superb system good luck all i m pasting the chart see it thanks Abid

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Can you please post your fibo levels? Indicator And what TF you using this template? 15M or more?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
no indicator bro just the simple fib drawing tool in any mt4 nothing else and i dont know there is any fib indicator too in the market anyway i just use the same tool we all have in mt4 thanks abid

--- 帖子 #73 ---
How do you draw fibo? From yesterday day or how?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
well u said that u read that thread alot but u cant bro there is an video there down load that video and see that video so u understand how u can draw the good fibo thanks abid

--- 帖子 #75 ---
so I understand you exit at opposite fib levels or what? would be very glad if u share your exit strategy. Entering is easy, but exiting is more important. And you place the stop at the other side of the river?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
what l like more for my trading style is the carry trade. Look at a daily chart for EY and GY with the river on and you will see that that is the real trade, holding up for 2 months now, and also imagine the swap. Damn, cant wait for GY or EY to fall below the river, so I can enter

--- 帖子 #77 ---
well thanks for asking exit means when u make some good pips means to put the pivot levels there and meant os ay if u long from pivot put r1 as target but ... trailing use trailing for +20 +30 pips so thats how u can get atleast 20 30 pips in 1 trade but if go high then u can get the level u want simple bro thanks abid

--- 帖子 #78 ---
as i am muslim i dont want swap and well what i believe make pips today and go out then new day new trading

--- 帖子 #79 ---

we got more and more good river trades these days. The trend is strongly up, so better ride it now while it holds...it will probably follow another boring range period. Everybody enjoy the ride with he river.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hello I want ask I downloaded setup from here. Is it correct setup on screen???

--- 帖子 #82 ---
This is a nice way to trade, but the thing to remember about these types of trade strategies is that this is no different than using a moving average crossover as a trade signal. It will work great in trending markets and eat your lunch in ranging markets. In addition, you are focused on a short timeframe -- make sure you zoom out to longer timeframes and are aware of what the overall trend is telling you. If you feel you must trade every "breakout" from the river then set small targets when trading against the overall trend and protect your profit vigorously.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi, Been away from this thread for a while and I just want to update you on the River Trade as I see it. During the ranging markets it has been a bit more difficult to trade the River on some pairs. I think we need to look at the other pairs during this time but in the last week it has been starting to turn. I will be posting some new charts soon and once we start trending again, the pips will fly. PowerTrader

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi all I'm actively trying this in it's 'most basic' form. Ie just waiting for the full open close of preceding candle below/ above the River and entering, then use pivot points to exit. Just wondered if the last 2 days have been exceptional in your experiences?. I registered 230 pips Monday (GPB/JPY; GBP/USD; USD/CHF;AUD/USD;USD/JPY) and 190 yesterday (4 pairs) Any similar reselts? Cheers Rob

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Which timeframe are you using?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
15mins on all pairs. Do you guys wait for a complete move through the River before entering?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
well guys sorry ws away and welcome back POWERTRADER anyway i m just able to get like 230 pips total with GJ this week in thiwhc 1 loss trade is also included coz not every time we win nothing is 100% sure anyway uptil yet the system is soo much great and its porifitable in ranging market too thanks power once again to introduce this system thanks abid

--- 帖子 #88 ---
how do i use the cgi and absolute strength histogram?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Power trader, thanks for sharing this system. I've backtest this river, but I see also false signal. I try reduce it by not trading in asia market as you suggest, but I still see false signal. Or we must use higher TF ? May be you could give some tips or explanation how to avoid it. thanks, regards okabija

--- 帖子 #90 ---
not many posts on this thread recently, but I guess everyone keeps on making profits on GY because recently has been wildly trending. I got opportunity after opportunity, with very few losses. Thank you Rivertrader.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi I am using the River and have mixed results.... It would be good to post results/ set ups to compare with all similar traders? I had only one trade last week on Tuesday for 24 pips. I use a 30 pip SL and a break even at 15. If anyone would like to share results/ set ups, I'm sure we could fine tune to greater success. Any takers? Cheers Rob (in UK)

--- 帖子 #92 ---
cant beleive how dead this thread got??????? where everyon go looks like a great method backtested 4hour japyen with river and 62 envelope and looks great {Please everyone start pposting about the river lets keep this thread alive)

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Dont get scared, my friend. Im sure all the users of River are making good scalping money with it. I use it on the 15 min charts, and I usually trade with the trend i.e. I wait for the dip to finish, and enter long at the first candle formed above the river. Last week I didnt take any River trades until Friday, due to the holidays and the range it made... But since then I entered long at 247.10 and 248 and now im in green on both. I use the River 15 on both Eur jpy and Gbp jpy. The 4H River is great, every one can see that...the only problem is that it gives very rare signals, so if you miss them, you have to wait for a long time until the next one. My use of River consists of the CCI Sniper and Fib levels and trend lines, besides the basic setup, and it works great - just needs some discretion sometimes, i.e. dont enter blindly on a candle which formes outside the river, but first see the overall direction.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi gagiul Are the basic rules for entry on the 4h the same as 15 min?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
They are similar, but not exactly the same. Besides new EMAs are applied. You can look through this thread and find complete guide on RiverWild along with good video tutorial. Patience is really trader's friend as well as trend http://www.forexsrdc.com/forum/showthread.php?t=714

Hi Netwise, Thanks a lot for your big contribution in this thread. Please advise me, if you made some modification indicators on River Methode? and..where I found "Non lagging ZIGZAG_V2 indicator, with price=0, length=100 and PctFilter=2.0. Use it to help set your Fibos". I didn't find in my MT4 platform (Alpari-idc). Thank You regards, Khamid

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Abid, I wondered what you were using to give your signals in the WSS chatroom.....NOW I know! LOL! carwood Otherwise known as Pip Meister

well i dont use this for giving signals :d i am using 2 techniqs and well if u see this river u see previous and today u just got loss in this coz u follow and its touched stop loss :d u need to learn learn learn and learn carwood good luck netwise

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Just kidding you a little! I didn't take the trade....I use different methods and am up over 220 pips this week....and I want to learn more! PM

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I have just configured this system on my trade platform. I have a couple questions: 1) Do I have to use candles? Or can I use bar charts? 2) Is it safe to enter the trade when a full bar (rather than full candle) forms outside on the other side of the river? The reason I ask is I can't get my trade platform to switch to candles even though I select it. Thanks, Frank

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Is anyone else seeing a "sell" signal on GBP/JPY with this system? I see that "bar" has formed after crossing the river. I want to make sure I configured this right. Thanks, Frank

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Candles and Bars on all charts ar the same exact data. They are the same thing... They have the same high low open and close, so they work the same way

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thanks Scott! That's what I was assuming, but just thought I'd confirm with someone that knows more than I do. Frank

How we can avoid false singals in River. any indicator or suggestions thanks..

--- 帖子 #112 ---
It has been a while since I have posted here about the River Trade but it is still working well. Combined with my PowerTrading Method you can filter out most of the bad trades. The basics are essential to understanding how to trade. By basics I mean, Fibonacci, support and resistance and trendlines. If you combine the River with these basics you will be successful. PT I will be posting charts again very soon. 90 pips today with this method.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Here is a chart and you will see a sell order still active. I was able to collect 90 pips today from the top of this chart and playing the River twice today. The current position is up but I will probably take it out if it moves back.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Welcome back PT

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thanks and there will be much more to come. PT

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I am still in final position from earlier today. I am up 62 pips at this point but I am not convinced to close it yet because we keep making lower highs and I am looking for a break of the 2.0300 to see if it wants to run a long way. The chart shows our sell ticket and if you look at the Fibs and the pattern of the day, it is obvious why we were able to take three sell trades this day. PT

--- 帖子 #117 ---
All trades can be trumped by news. In the case of my last open position we were following a good downward trend and were not threatening the upper trendline until just prior to this mornings news. At that point, not knowing which way the news would go, I set a stop loss at 72 pips profit and hoped it would continue to go short. It took me out, as usual, and I ended with 72 pips for this last sell order. Not bad but not what I had hoped for with this trade. Notice in the chart the upper trendline and how it held right up until news time. You can certainly see the news effect. PT

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Yeah some time ago I was nicely loosing on that rriverr now i will try to loose on GU

--- 帖子 #119 ---
When you learn a new method/system you should first decide if it works and if it is worth your time to learn. Here are some facts you may want to consider before spending any of your time learning the River and my Power Trading Method. So many people here and other places claim to make pips but never actually show you the proof. Most of the charts I have and will post will have actual sell or buy orders in place you can see. In addition I opened an new account in September along with my trading partner that will be audited by a CPA . I will report pip count, win to loss ratio and other important information from this account. Wouldn't it be nice if everybody did the same. Here are the figures for September: Total Positive Pips 481 Lost Pips -59 Net Pips gained 422 Total Trades 36 Wins 32 Losses 2 Breakeven 2 The account grew by nearly 20 % for the Month! These are the results I had from this account trading only one currency pair, GBP/USD. If you are having better results then these, you should start your own thread. PT

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Here are a few examples of trades from last week. Notice the two sell tickets from 10/8. This is a typical River trade but the trick is where to enter. You can not base this on a cross alone. You can't base it on any one basic. You need to understand Fibonacci, Price Action, Trendlines and Support and Resistance. Any one will not work on it's own.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Here is the same trade from the next day. Having the knowledge to stay in a trade is not the same as having the nerve. It should always be based on knowledge, nerve will lose your account. The two sell positions from the previous day are still in place. We are up bigtime now where do we exit and why?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Here are the charts from 10/11. We still had two sell positions in play early. We took one position out at 70 pips and let the other ride. When price backed up on us, no panic just sell another position at a much better place with profit already in the bank. When you learn how to trade you will understand multiple positions and how they can make you money.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Notice this chart from Friday. No more orders in place. All closed for profit and then look at what happened with the news. This is how your trading week should go. It should have these types of results. Now what to do on Sunday? Do you know where you will enter? You should have an idea of where you may enter a sell or buy trade, but then let price determine what you actually do. I hope this helps you better understand.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Here we are in another sell position and as you can see on the chart we are up 60 pips at this time. We entered based on Fibonacci and breaking of support. Now where to exit?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
This will explain our entry and exit strategy on this trade. We enter on a River move but we needed to wait until support was broken. As you can see from our target entry we missed by a few pips because we had a falling knife candle at that point. We are now up about 70 pips and you can see the support is my 76.4 Fib area. If we can break the 76.4 and the 2.0300 level we should run for 100 pips. If we come back up through the 61.8 level, that would be an exit for me on this position. One more thing here, we have news out at 9am and after US time and that could move it either way.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
After banking my original pips I allowed for a bounce and then took another sell position once strong support was broken again. You can see new sell order in place now.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Closed out final position for the day at 11 pips. That brings us to a total of 51 pips for the day. Not a bad day but could have taken a few more. My next move will be to look for a break under the 2.0300 area for a sell. If we move back up around 2.0400 I will take a short there as well if all conditions line up. PT

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I am finding it much easier to take a sell position on the cable because we are at a very high price for this pair. I took a short at 2.0380 based on the spike to that point yesterday and my fib levels at the time of the order. I also had suggested I would take a short around the 2.0400 area. I am currently up about 28 pips but it could bounce back up at anytime.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
In this current short position we are starting to consolidate around the 50% retracement level. I think it is very likely that if we don't bounce back up from here we will move down a bit more and have consolidation around 61.9 to 76.4 level. I am going to let this position ride unless it backs up and I will take it out with a very small gain. PT

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Cable come on down

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I see lower highs on the 4 hour cable..our las run down was weak though...i think we move lower from here

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Well we didn't go lower, so I closed out my position for a small gain. I have been a bit surprised at the levels price is trading. I have expected some heavy duty down moves and I still do. I am currently short from the top with two other short positions to kick in. I am staying away from long positions at this time except for a short burst here or there. Because I am only trading the cable at this time, I think I will set out the rest of the day after I close my current trade, unless my other targets are triggered. PT

Watching this move closely. I have a stop loss set now and it would be well over 100 pips and we are now up more than 150 pips on this single move. Great isn't it. I wish everyone would post some charts with the sell and buy orders in place. Keeps everyone honest.

--- 帖子 #143 ---

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Trading in the Zone When trading the River on any other method it is important to understand where the Support and Resistance are located. If you can isolate price you are then able to identify where the breakout my occur. When using this either with the River or Fibonacci, price action will determine where to enter and exit the trade. Notice on my chart I have created a box but unlike other box methods there is no defined time on the beginning or end of this box. This box can extend over multi-day periods. You could extend even if there is a breakout if price then returns into the same area after the breakout. The more times price consolidates inside these zones the more effect the breakout. You continue to update it until you start to have movement in price. I will be posting more on this but for the time being try drawing a box once price action slows for the day and continue till price starts to move again. It requires some practice like all other methods. PT

--- 帖子 #146 ---
you talk a lot about support and res.....tell me....when you draw your yellow boxes, how did you know where to stop and start them? Also, does that work on a higher time frame, for example a 4 hour or daily chart?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Great question XS, I start to draw the box when price action slows down for the day and continue to update it until price starts to move again and when I say move again, I mean move more than a few pips up and down. Yes it will work on higher time frames as well. Anytime you can consolidate price you have an opportunity to trade the break. Hope this helps, PT

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Here is what I am looking at to determine where we could place an order later. I pulled a Fib from previous move and in this case it was high to low. We have retraced back to 23.6 and a little past. If we are going to continue downward we could turn here or at the 38.2 or 50% level. I am looking for a continuation of the downward move but, based on history from the last several weeks, we are in that ranging area where we could go right back up. If you look at my posts you will see I have been living on short positions this entire month. So, with all this knowledge and information what do we do? We wait for Price Action to determine our next move. I have a limit order in place for a short at the 50% level which is also just under the 2.0400 area but I may pull it once I watch price. Most likely I will not take a long position tonight although there may be a good move that direction. If I miss it I will simply catch the short on the way back down. Now this is my trading thoughts and I respect that others may be looking for a long position.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Using the River and the Zone you could have made some great pips already this morning. However as I have said I am living on sell orders this month so I am looking for a place for a reversal. This will give you an idea though of how you can judge when to take a River trade. We broke out of consolidation long. Notice we broke out at the 38.2 fib level. We are still in this range and it allows us plenty of room to make pips.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hello PT ! bro i request u one thing if u r able to make an EA of this method it will be high appreciated or if u know some one who can do it thanks Netwise

--- 帖子 #154 ---
There have been a few attempts but I don't think there is a formula for success with this method. You need to understand fibonacci and the other basics to succeed. I am open to try one again but I have tested at least 4 and none were good. PT

--- 帖子 #155 ---
well bro thanks for ur reply i dont need the EA for my self but for others who are new in this and also alot of guys need some time to understand the baisc things of this system with the help of fib thats why i want an EA otherwise i dont need it for my self i completely understand this system and working with it like before 6 months and make huge huge profits every day what i wana say if some one patiently trade with this system then i am 100% sure he can make atleast 100 pips a day for sure ( thats what i can make every day as u can see the pictures above i post ) thanks once again POWERTRADER u introduce a great system which really works thanks NETWISE

Well I am stuck in the range area today. I have two sell positions in place and down on both but not worried much. I could have taken both of them out in profit earlier and the first position could have been taken in profit several times. I am confident we will break this tight area sometime in the next 24hrs and I will get my 50 to 100 pips. I am glad to see others doing well today. I am just watching it all today.

hey what i wana say brother that gj is high volatile pair and brokers give 8 pips spread ( fxdd i am using ) so i think using it for 1 min TF is not that much clever thing but anyway if u can make profit with them its good but i and PT just prefer 15m TF its good and working very very fine good luck Netwise

i don't understand...do you draw fibo from yesterday HI LOW to....?

bro i think u cant understand me well i draw the fibo from yesterday hi to yesterday low and yesterday low to yesterday high that what i mean i hope u understand

--- 帖子 #182 ---
i understood, thanks since now i drawn fibos on 30 or 1h TF's, but retracements levels doesn't work properly. P.S. on 1min TF i obtained nice results, but i cannot stay at computer every minute I'll try 15min

--- 帖子 #183 ---
sorry to say bro please dont mind but i think u r new in forex when u draw the fib low to high , high to low well they are same on 1h 30m or 15m or even 1m no change in them bro i am sorry but i think i cant understand what u wana say anyway THE RIVER is good for us and its giving daily some nice pips good luck every one who using RIVER and thanks to POwer Trader who introduce this Netwise

--- 帖子 #184 ---
ya, i'm new to fx, but i draw one fibo and use only it. Before i said i put fibo on the last up or down trend on 30m TF or 1h TF. Now i work better with your suggestion. Thanks

--- 帖子 #185 ---
We are still in a very tight range on the Gbp/Usd. I have not moved the fibs from two days and you can see we are in between ) 0 to 23.6 with just a few wicks outside that area. Here is my take on why we are in such a tight range. The fundamentals have been completely terrible for the USD, but at the same time we are at such a high level, the big boys do not want to push this pair too much higher. This is a nervous time because there is only so much bad news the dollar can take without losing even more ground to the Gbp. I still have my short positions in place and now is the time for patience.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
First and 2nd Trade of the Day ======================= Hello Guys ! Attached herewith the picture of the trade i do first trade i do short and i loss 50 pips in that touched my SL and 2nd trade i do long and i got +100 in that trade so overall +50 for today see the attched picture Thanks Netwise

--- 帖子 #187 ---
We are now in the 4th day of tight ranging with just a few breaks. If you had taken the breaks there were some pips there but I am still looking for short positions only at this level. That could be a mistake but so far it is okay. I took some pips this morning from the high but I still have a few positions open where I am behind. I think this will all play out Monday. I still have fibs set from several days ago on this chart but I will update them for next week.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Any River Theory's user or expert knows how long this system is used? I like it and i read it works with a lot of indicators changes too, but how old is it?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I am not sure the age of this system/method. You can look into the history of the 62 envelope here on FF and come to your own conclusion. For me I do not trade it as a cross anymore and haven't for quite some time. Without the basics, it will often give false signals. With knowlege of Fibonacci, Support and Resistance, Price Action, Trend lines, Zone Breakout and proper Money Management, it is very effective. PT

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I seen the false signals of this system can be avoided waiting for the right candle formation... like no other i've tried....so this is a power point in trading systems. I've to say to you 1 more thing: i really appreciate the 4h version (riverwild) you posted a while ago. Did you use it anymore? Because since now i seen it has more clearly entries and with a proper money management could be more successfull than the 15min one. What do you think about it? I ask you about it cause i don't found many informations on it.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I still trade using the RiverWild but I have not posted to that thread for while as it did not have the same interest as the 15min. I will put together some posts in the future. PT

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Ok thanks PT. RiverWild is designed for 4h TF, right? And are blue line levels a sort of take profit areas? I found a personal way to entry and exit based on Fibonacci, trade lines, pivots and river of course, but i'm not yet able to re-enter when the trend continues after a little retracement. Any help? Thanks

--- 帖子 #193 ---
The good news about trading the River with knowledge is you can change direction when the market calls for it. You can actually do this with any method and knowing when is the key. Understanding we were building to an interest rate cut would allow you to position yourself over the last few days to take the ride up. PT

--- 帖子 #194 ---
First of all I'm really want to thank you for share this method with us, I'm follow Rob since more than 4 years and I really learn a lot from him. Your system look great and I want to ask you if you can let me know how to "read" the FX Sniper's and also the Absolute Strength (or were can I found something). If you consider a good idea I can put every night all trades using your system. Thank you again for share it.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Finally got that move short I have been looking for and made 75 pips today. Sometimes you just have to sit it out until you get what you want. I actually was up about 100 pips and kept moving stop up until finally we went back enough to knock me out. This is a good lesson on locking in profit. It would be a shame to have given 75 pips back, I was not very happy giving 25 back. Here is the chart I used today but keep in mind I went in early based on my perception but even if you had waited for the breakout of the zone, there were still lots of pips. PT

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Looks like a great system, cant wait to trial it live... Thanks again for sharing! GCTrader http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Another GREAT TRADE... Thanks again to all for share this strategy

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Great Job, I am going to be talking more in the future about the zone breakout (yellow box). It is a major part of how I trade this method, but you are doing a great job. Good luck, PT

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Here we go with a River reversal. We have started the retrace based on the upward move of today. This could be very short term if we continue this strong upward move but I have already locked SL into profit at 2 pips . As usual I jumped in just a bit ahead of the zone break but I don't advise it until you are comfortable. Also, it is not always a good idea to jump into a trade late in the US session.

Here are the results from my PowerTrading method on my audited account for October October Overview 448 Positive pips for the month Averages: 112 per week 10 out of 10 Positive trades 100% Success Rate This account is now over 20 percent profit in 2 months. Do the math, if you invested 20,000, you now have over 24,000. If you invested 200,000, you now have over 240,000. Pretty good return in two months. This account is audited for accuracy by a CPA.

Crongratulations for your REALLY GREAT JOB. Personally I think that better that a Trader is ALWAYS Better found a Strategy that work, and you made it. Congratulations again. Back to the Market... since last night after the meeting and the Euro jumpping to the new record (and all pairs doing the same) we can wait for a retracement, just how you said... maybe for a litlle pips, but it's important to take the idea, try to see "The Zone" where the consolidation is forming and wait for a retracement. Maybe can help put in the chart the fib retc. ussing the last Zig Zag to see some targets. Thank PT

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thank you and you are correct. I want to edit the first page to make changes to this method that I feel are important but I am trying to change the thread name and I need to see if they will let me do it. PT

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Finding myself at a critical position here. We are bouncing off the 38.2 fib from the retracement of todays move. It is acting as good resistance at the moment but if we break I could give back a lot of pips. Up 57 at the moment.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
It broke back through the 38.2 fib and I took it out with 41 pips. I have now extended the zone to the 38.2 fib and if we break back down, I will enter another short or look for another reversal on the high. I will not place another trade until much later. It is very important to note how I changed the zone from the earlier post and why. The range is now between the high of the day and that 38.2 fib. You must be willing to adjust your zone to identify actual support and resistance. Notice we use the fibs to help and the zone will normally be between two or three fib numbers depending on the range of the day. PT

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I will be editing the first page in the next few days to better show how the PowerTrading Method works and we will still use elements of the River. Believe me when I tell you this refined method is much better, just look at our September and October results. PT

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Yester I have been in contact with Igor who made the NonLag Zig Zag as by request he made some changes and add a Fibo retracement directly with the las Zig Zag. Remember that the original setting it's: Price = 0; Length = 100; PctFilter = 2.0. PowerTrend, I'm thing that it's a very good idea set again the first page with the new rules, If you need any assistant for something don't hesitate in let me know, I want to cooperate with you and anybody in this Thread. Bull

--- 帖子 #208 ---
i can't wait to read your news on the river i really like this system. 15min and 4h too.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
From what I have seen, this is the most productive stratagy i have tried in a long time. The results are great. Thanks PT

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hello, I have been backtesting this system and I really like it. I have a couple questions though. When a candle closes outside the river it should have no part of it touching the river, correct? Not just open and close but the high and low shouldn't touch either? Also, when would you take a trade in the same direction as the previous one you have taken? Obviously you wouldn't trade in the same direction if a candle closed outside the river in the opposite direction. But what if it touched the the opposite side of the river and reversed again to form a candle outside the river in the same direction. Would you take that trade? What would be the criteria for that? Touching the inside bank? The middle? The outside bank?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Good questions here. First, under the original rules of entry you would enter when the first candle is formed outside the River without touching. Please understand it is important not to enter based solely on this move. It can be affected by time of day, news releases, etc. You must be aware of everything around you. I am going to post some new rules this weekend and it will really help with the process. PT

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I am not too big on indicators but I am going to try this. I started out using zigzag and want to look at it again. PT

--- 帖子 #213 ---
After we hit the top, I decided to take a quick reversal. Here it turned back on me and I picked up 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I have started updating the first page. Please be patient, it will be completed this weekend. New to the PowerTrading River will be "Zone Breakout". This is a method I developed by using a box strategy, not based on some particular time frame but on Support and Resistance and Fibonacci. This is very effective! There will be some new charts and Templates too. PT

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I had a short in place from close to the high and it just hit Take Profit for 69 pips. Of course it continued to run after that but 69 in the bank is a good nights work. Even if you had waited for the zone breakout you would have made over 70 pips so far if you let it run. PT

--- 帖子 #216 ---
This is current. You can see how far this thing ran. It goes to show you can never get them all. PT

--- 帖子 #217 ---
PT, it's great to see that you began updating the first page with the new rules. I'll back test the system in EURUSD and USDCAD for start and I'll show what going on. Again, let me know if I can cooperate in any other manner. Bull

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Now this is a River Trade the right way. With my Zone Breakout you can avoid false signals. On this trade it was almost a typical River entry but using the breakout of the zone it becomes more powerful. The reason this is a better move now is when we broke the zone we broke support based on where price ranged back into yesterday. If I had played this better I would have continued to move the SL up and I would have taken more pips. You can see how PowerTrading the River is much more effective than the old way. PT

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Following the New rules, and the idea of "Zone Breakout", that what happend a few minutes ago with Cad

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Great Example, This method works on most pairs and although I am not supporting them here you can see it works. The Zone Breakout is just another way to identify S &amp; R and when it breaks it usually runs. Notice in most cases it will still be close to a normal River trade. I would like to see Fibonacci and some period separators on your chart. I think it will help. Great Post Bull, PT

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Thanks PT for this news. Are you upgrading the first post with instructions about Zone Breakout?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Today was an excellent trading day. We had a clear break from the top for a nice short position. I picked up 69 pips there as seen in my earlier posts. Then on the reversal I was able to pick up 23 more on a retracement back to the 38.2 fib of todays downward move. At the bounce there, I picked up another 17 on my second short position of the day. So two short positions and one long today for a total of 108 pips. I always try to post charts showing actual buy and sell positions and except for the last move I was able to post live everything I was doing. These charts are from a live account with real money. Important: Here is where a knowledge of Fibonacci really paid off. I was convinced after such a strong move down today we would have at least a small retracement so I entered long close to the low at the time (refer to earlier post). I figured it would go to at least the 23.6 and possibly the 38.2 if the downward movement was strong. I then entered short after the bounce at the 38.2. Notice I did not get all the pips that were on the table, nobody does . You must take your share and be smart about banking profits when you can. Really look at the chart I am posting. I have the Fibonacci of the up move of the last two days in gray and the retracement in red. See if you are able to understand my entries. It is now over for the week, any moves now would just be stupid and I would probably get burned. Have a great weekend, PT

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Great trading system... I've been testing quite a lot of forex trading system... But this one rocks !!!

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Powertrader and thanks for all this information!. I have been trading the method for a few months now and any method to reduce the 'false' breakouts is so useful to add to the system, so reading with interest.. I am also testing on the 5 min charts across a few currencies taking the trades just on the break of the river with usual stops and 20 pip TP. This seems fairly successful, but riskier.. Any views?. Do you have a separate forum or dimilar where we can all post results on a trade by trade basis?. I find that is a great way to improve, by seeing what trades others took the previous day and comparing 'notes'.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
When would you take a trade if price bounces into the river and then back out? Should it touch the opposite side of the river? Or do you always wait for a cross? Should you be alternating between long and short trades?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
you don't need to wait a cross...bounce is good too

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hello PT, I want to congratulate you for the wonderful work you are doing here. About the new strategies, I have 2 questions: 1. Will you present the Box Breakout strategy in the beginning of this thread? 2. I would like to know how do you pull the Fibs - from the high to the low of the previous day? Thanx a lot and keep it up.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I am starting to post the revised setup and it will all be up over the next 24 hours. PT

--- 帖子 #229 ---
This is the first draft of the revised setup. I will be placing templates and other files later. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...08#post1430908

--- 帖子 #230 ---
i am new to this one.........look like amazing...

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Thanks, I hope you learn it well and make lots of pips. PT

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Here are the moves from this morning. I am a little late in posting these but here is the possible entries from today. You will see I am in a long position now for a possible reversal. I am not completely sure of this move so I have a very tight stop loss here. Be smart!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
The moves today were textbook PowerTrading. This move today was made because of the zone breakout and you would have had some false signals without waiting. Just a reminder, I have updated the first page and included the breakout strategy. I will continue to refine in the next week or so. PT

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thank you, I have posted the breakout strategy on the first page and will try to refine it so it is very clear for all to understand. As for the Fibonacci placement, I pull from the previous dominant move. For example if the last major move was a short, I will pull from top to bottom, because we are looking for a percentage of retracement. Basically you are going to pull from left to right. I will also pull swings within the day. The smaller swings will allow you to pick up some extra pips. I am also looking at the fibs on the longer time frames as well. PT

--- 帖子 #235 ---
This is my setup for today. The zone has topped out at the 38.2 retracement of todays down move. It could go higher. Keep in mind the is some Gbp news coming out around 4am Eastern US time.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
EDIT: (ALL TALK ABOUT G/J) Hi PT ! just wanna inform you that ur pic is not showing.. I follow with big interest !! and i guess (while looking) at my charts the Position should be around +180pips as of writing..right? Edit:I personally will take out my First half of Position @ 229.30..

--- 帖子 #237 ---
As i cannot see ur screenshot i added mine ! i do not understand exactly what u mean by "it topped out @ 38.2 retracement" IMHO i see it bottom out @ the red arrows.. I would have taken (if i were in front of my screen @ this time) my first trade with the closing of the first candle above and added to the position as price "bottomed" out @ 38.2 and around the Daily Pivot...@ the second red arrow.. I cannot see an "zone" there clearly ...hope my interpretation is right... (JUST IMHO i would have traded only half my normal position size as i am not quite sure of the yen situation and chinas yen buying overall...anyone else who would have hesitated to trade against the tide? ) EDIT: ohohoh me idiot lol ...no wonder i dont see the zone when i look @ gbp/jpy haha..okay forget it but may i know how u would have traded this , PT? Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Not sure why you can't see my chart. I am able to see it. Is there any other charts you can't see? BTW.. I am not supporting the Gbp/Jpy in this thread. I am only charting the Gbp/Usd. PT

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Here is the current chart. I took a short as we broke the zone and am up about 60 pips. I will be moving stop up before the news at 8:30 to protect my profit. PT

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi can we have your templates ??

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I will work on getting templates up this morning. I have been have some problems with attachments and I am not sure why but I will get them up when I can. PT

--- 帖子 #242 ---
My trade got stopped at 40 pips profit with movement before the news came out. I am looking now to enter again if we get a clear bounce off the 38.2. Keep in mind I will have a very tight stop just above that 38.2 fib. If we go through I will probably wait until tonight to place another trade. 40 pips in the bank is not bad but I think we could have banked 80+ if we had taken all that was available. PT

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I can see all ur charts ..only post 235 i see nothing.. okay thx for info ! i will focus on g/u then too!

--- 帖子 #244 ---
If you are thinking about playing a bounce, make sure you wait until you have a clear bounce. Let a few candles open the other direction because the dollar is very weak and this thing could run up a long way. Patience is the thing here. PT

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I am not sure what the problem with that post could be. I have edited it and re loaded the chart and I can see it but I am not sure why you can't. Also, I will go back to supporting the Geppy sometime in the future. This method is working so well right now with the Cable I have not wanted to look at anything else. PT

--- 帖子 #246 ---
This is what I am talking about here. Perfect place for a bounce but make sure price gets back inside the 38.2 and again be patient. It could very easily go other direction. Any move here should have a tight stop loss. PT

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I took the bounce once we got back inside the 38.2 with a second candle. I am currently up 11 pips but I have already locked in 1 pip profit in case in turns. I think this could continue down but I am trading smart. PT

--- 帖子 #248 ---
The 23.6 is now acting as support. If we can break through we should run down to the low of the day. But it is tough going right now. I am currently up 16 pips but it is changing every minute. This is about as live as I can get with helping here. (refer to chart in previous post)

--- 帖子 #249 ---
We have now broken through the 23.6 and it could be off to the races. I am currently up 32 pips and it is still moving. I am going to try to lock 20 in and let in run but I will watch it for a while. The 23.6 is now resistance so we should be in very good shape. If you have followed my posts this morning you will see this has went down as we have thought but no trades were made until we had actual verification by price.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Just hit my target of 50 pips and closed my bounce position. I could possibly have taken a few more but we all know about greed. I may jump back in if we get below the low of the day. Other wise 90 pips on the day is good work. I hope you followed me through the trades today because it was textbook PowerTrading and you could have picked up some great pips. PT

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Here we go. Right back in after we broke the low of the day and already up another 30 pips. What a day!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I just closed this one at 25 pips. I am tired and it will probably have some retracement. Great day! I worked hard for them but the last 25 was a gift. Total pips today 115. If you go back and read through this thread this morning you will see I posted as quickly as I could and let you know what I was doing. These were real trades with real money. I am done for this day.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Just executed my first LIVE River Trade on the G/J. I entered at 230.13 and exited at 229.32 for +81 pips. Great methodology. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Great Job, Glad it worked out for you. Be sure to use all the tools with this method for best results. PT

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I was already trading off 15m charts and used fibs the same as you did, so it was a very easy implementation. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I know I said I was finished for the day but I could not resist taking what could be a nice reversal. I have already locked 5 pips of profit so I will let this one run. Lol....what a day! Update: Closed it out when it backed up to my SL at 5pip profit.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Great

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Short @ 230.01, closed @ 229,71 on 15m TF I'm working with river systerm since 1 month and i had a lot of positive trades, but i'm looking this Zone...it's really useful. PowerTrader can you say if you draw more than one Zone a day?If so, why?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I will only draw a new zone when the other is broken, otherwise I will extend it. I do start a new zone, usually after 18:00 GMT or whenever things slow down and price starts to consolidate. Here is an example. I have already started the new one. PT

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Yeah i can see it now...everything okay ! Also i wanna ask if it is okay when i throw in some geppy charts from time to time or if u want to hold this thread as clean as possible..if u want it clean i will delete my other attachments from before.. KindRegards, Aidan

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I am glad you can see it now. Yeah, for sure post those Geppy charts anytime you like. I am going to cover it again once we get a grip on the Cable. I am happy to see this strategy is working for you. I have been working up charts with the Geppy and I can say I could have made more pips with it than the Cable providing I followed the same rules. PT

--- 帖子 #262 ---
God bless you PT twice first for base river system and second for the Zone. I done 50pips short right now (i'll post screens when my internet connection goes better). One more information: Since when the the price breaks the zone i wait for the first candle out of it to start my trade. Do you wait its formation out of the zone too? EDIT: i'm working on G/J 15min TF

--- 帖子 #263 ---
this is my last short trade, waiting for the first candle outside the Zone.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Great Trade, PT

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Took a short and the news went my way for once. I am up and I will hold until it backs up. I have 20 pips locked in profit.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I think it is a good idea to wait for the candle to open. I don't always follow that way. Sometimes I will go ahead and jump in if we break a fib level. PT

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I start the new possible Zone for a price reversal. G/J on 15min TF

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hi ! Just wanted to post my PaperTrade today on cad/jpy ..manual/visual backtests show me this pair also works fine with the River15mins! Please pay attention that i use the Fibos another way : I draw the Fib from the last significant High to the Low,but @ the Low i always draw the 23.6 lvl...only to make sure everybody understands..the FIB was drawn BEFORE Price left the Zone...StopLoss @ Pivot Point in this case The targets are Normal Pivot Sup/Res... I "would have" moved the SL to BE on the break of the 23.6 Fib (or took whole Profit there depending on Price Action as there was minor support) I hope i can soon have enough time to provide real "demotrades" and maybe i will get a little micro account for showing live trades.. As usual feel free to correct me Kind regards, Aidan

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I think a micro account would be a great next step. You are doing very well in demo and you should go live when you feel comfortable. Great move today. PT

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I took the one short at news time at around 4:30 am and took exactly 50 pips (see entry on previous post). I should have taken the reversal back to the 38.2 but I am not comfortable with price action today and I will wait for the next breakout to trade again. PT

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Thanks for your encouragement...hehe i allready paid about 5K€ for my "education" ..losses are the best teacher lol But as i said the River15 and River240 are my most favourite besides my own creation...!

I just don´t understand one thing..u entered ur short allready BEFORE price crossed the River... see my example how i would have taken it.. OF COURSE IN HINDSIGHT I ALWAYS TRADE PERFECTLY so my exampe is in HINDSIGHT ..not like my cad/jpy trade.. EDIT: Just btw ..GBP/USD crossed the River240..i took a short there...can i post them too? 240Entrys are rare but thats ur thread PT

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi PowerTrader and all this is a nice thread good luck

--- 帖子 #274 ---
You are exactly right. If you look back at my posts you will see there are many times I enter early. This comes with time and I have been developing this method and trading it for a long time. But, I do not advise getting an early start until you understand the method. Remember, not all trades are those breaking the zone , sometimes you have a reversal from the high or low of the day. I enter then with the understanding we should retrace to the nearest fib level. I always keep a very tight SL on these trades. Good observation. PT

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Thx for your explanation !

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Thank you, PT

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I am setting up the Zone for the next day. We have made two trips back to the 38.2 of todays move and we could possibly see another. If this Zone holds for the day, it will be a great move when we break it. PT

--- 帖子 #278 ---
PT please check the Quote Post#275. thx

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yeah, it is okay. Let's not post a lot of them, but they would be good for discussion. Thanks, PT

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Ya wish is my command ! so i concentrate on g/u and g/j..so there will be about 2 post a month about that ... so now u expect a nice move with cable if it breaks the actual zone to the upside or downside right.. After getting that river240signal now and interpreting fundis (especially the now really rolling credit crunch) i expect much more probability to the downside the next days... Also the weekly channel still offers some more downside before significant Support plays a role..(a weekly Pinbar there too)..next medium support 2.0300 inmyview Thank you very much PowerTrader for allowing me to post this stuff..it really helps me to focus and improve..I am still only 1 Year @ the markets (24/7 if possible )..so for everyone consider my OPPINION/RESEARCH as an schoolars one.. PT is the Threadstarter and Teacher! now my River240 chart I Entered a 1% of capital short at the actual Candle which is the first red candle below the River which will close soon. In Retrospect i think i should have waited for an retracement to the 38.2 like PT is telling us in Post #277.. Could give an better entry But my Stop is above so i can wait it out.

--- 帖子 #281 ---

--- 帖子 #286 ---
We just broke out of the Zone. As usual I am in a little bit early because I jumped in on the last Fib swing and then it broke.. This is a good break. I am currently up 70 pips and have locked 40 in with SL. PT

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Good Job again you are catching pips with this strategy every day now. PT

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I am out with 40 pips profit but looking to get back in if we turn of bottom of the Zone. You can understand my thinking if you look at the fibs for today. When we broke back through the 23.6 of todays move, I took my profit and put my 40 pips in the bank. Now if we go up here and have a standard 38.2 bounce I will get back in once I have conformation. 2.0400 should be some support. Be smart. PT

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Watching this move. The 2.0400 has held on the first attempt to go through but we could have another. That area was also the 38.2 retracement of the the high to low of today. Don't jump back in without confirmation. PT

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Tested the 38.2 which will now be short term resistance. We tried to come back through the 23.6 which will now be short term support. There is not much price action at the moment so no reason to act. PT

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I took too long with that last post. Here is a better picture of what is going on now. Both fib areas and the 2.0400 are holding for the time being. PT

Not really today..my Stoploss was hit on the retracement..so -54 pips for me today My River240 Positions were both stopped out@ BE ! But no problem ,opportunities are abundant ohh just see there were also 2 longs on geppy and cad/jpy which i missed also

--- 帖子 #295 ---
XSDelivers and sitges, thank you for getting back to me, can you please tell me how to draw the box on the MT4 chart? I understand the concept of color zone, but don't know how to draw the box, there are tools to draw the lines but not the box. Thanks

--- 帖子 #296 ---
If you are using MT4 charts you go to insert and then shapes and select rectangle. I hope that helps. PT

--- 帖子 #297 ---
See where we ended up today. Notice we broke the Zone on both sides. I normally do not take trades so late in the day on Friday so I did not take the break at the top although it was good for some pips. Good day today. PT

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Stay tuned! I am going to break down todays trading for you and show you where you could have made pips and where we actually did. I will be explaining our method in relationship to fibonacci and support and resistance (The Zone). Understanding what we are teaching will make it much easier to do on your own. I am going to spend quite a bit of time working on this so you should read. This method when understood completely is unlike any other. PT

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Powertrader your words are right. Trading the cable is easier with the zone. But i would advice other people that g/j is harder to trade with Zone because its trending volatility. Cable has more consolidation price periods unlike g/j. So the basic 15min river system should works better then the modified one on g/j. I tried both with the Zone and i never lost pips with cable unlike g/j.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Very well put darko80, I was the biggest fan of the G/j but have found more consistant trading by eliminating it. I am not advising anyone else to follow but that is my finding. Thanks, PT

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thank you for teaching me how to draw the color box and thank you for sharing your system with us.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
PT and guys!! I dont know how to draw zone box and if you know, please let me know how to do that? I put your template "river template" but there is no zone box. Please help me!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
The Zone Box must be drawn manually by going to the insert and selecting insert shapes and selecting rectangle. Where you draw the box is more in depth and you will need to read the first page and the last few pages of this thread to understand. This is a manual trading method not an EA so you have to learn it. Hope this helps, PT

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks PT! I have red this entire thread so I am very well initiated that for this strategy EA is not a big advantage.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
1st trade of the week was a good one. I caught this near the top placed a short for 68 pips. If you would have waited for the Zone breakout you still could have banked 60 + pips. PT

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Took a short position on the Fib bounce and locked in a few pips. It has already started to back up but we will let this one run until it makes pips or backs up a few in profit. PT

--- 帖子 #307 ---
These are my 2 Zones on g/j e cable. g/j usually doesn't have ranging periods so take this Zone as a result of the current market sentiment. PT, do you think the Zone on cable is created correctly?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Good job here. The only thing I did different on the Gbp/Usd was to leave the original Zone from early and when we moved back up into it, I just extended it over leaving the breakout short from earlier out of the box. I think on the short side your box is perfect, but on the high side I would want to see it break that high of the day before entering long. Just a thought. PT

--- 帖子 #309 ---
ok thanks for the suggestion Powertrader

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I extended the Zone @ 2.0478 on cable, because there is the daily pivot there and price bounce on it

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I think this zone is great. We need to watch Price Action and the time of day for entering trades as well. For example: If we break the Zone later in the trading day, I would want confirmation with a candle or two underneath or above the Zone box before entering. Because price is not moving quickly at this time of the day, it should not cost you many pips to wait. Great work , PT

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Ok i have just read thru the whole thread and here is my question: "Why dont you just get rid of all the Envelope and SMA indicators and only trade fibs, because as far as i can see that is what you trade anyway?"

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Today is all a big zone i tried to gain some pips before price bouncing on the pivot but i picked only a few. Cable and Zone are brothers really PT, do you think this relationship is natural or linked to the current cable price market? If so, it could be change in future

--- 帖子 #314 ---
the river gives to you signals on ranging market when price bounce inside it or around it

--- 帖子 #315 ---
You are correct. I do not use many custom indicators so I do like the LW 50ma to give me an idea of what might happen. If we move through the 50 or the 62 envelope, the probability of a move in that direction becomes more likely. For me, referring to these indicators is the same as referring to other time frames. It is just more information to confirm my decision. I want as much information to help me make my trade as possible. PT

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I think you clearly have to link fundamentals that are happening away from the technical charts to our trading. We must be aware of things like inflation, oil prices, anything in the world economy that my influence our price. It is my opinion and we know about opinions, that the Gbp is over valued against the Usd at this time and a correction will take place. The thing is, we must be prepared to go in the direction price takes us. Again good work darko80, PT

--- 帖子 #317 ---
In that case why dont you just draw a S/R line for the ranging market? And go long once resistance is broken or short once support is broken. I get the impression you guys are making something simple very complicated. In reality you are only trading breakouts. So S/R levels will do well, complimented by fibs. Even simple chart formations like rising/falling wedges will also do. You dont need an envelope or moving average to tell you that the price has broken a S/R level. That is the purpose of price action.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
darko80, One more thing on this point. If you look at my first post today you will see my zone was based on the last move up. My Zone was between the 0 and the 23.6 fib level. Now I did enter early but, even if you had waited on that break, it was a possible 60 + pips. I have adjusted the Zone as always through the course of the day to where it is now like yours. PT

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Yes PT, i lost that break cause i opened platform later

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Your point is very well taken and I do not disagree with you but I will comment. If you had joined this thread in the beginning it was called the River and it was based solely on a cross of the 62 envelope. It has evolved into its current form. I have not traded a simple cross since I begin to really understand trading. Fibonacci is key, but not the only key. Price Action is another component as is Trend Lines, Time of day, Fundamentals, Money Management and a host of other things. It is possible to make a method appear too simple and then everyone loses money. I am a Full time Forex Trader and I would not insult anyones intelligence by suggesting it is easy to be successful. FF is filled with what appears to be great ideas and the person in the thread doesn't know the first thing about making a profit. Look at my results! PT

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I did more or less the exact same trade today. I was only looking for the 1st candlestick that did not make a higher high. Once that candlestick's low was broken i went short. No indicators jsut plain price action. Anyway best of luck trading.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Thanks, I do want to be clear that I agree with you and I believe I could trade simply with Fibonacci and Trend Lines, but we do have some other tools as well and I use some of them. Good luck as well, PT

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hey Power Trader, Perhaps your thread and thinking will educate me more than what i initially thought. Like yourself i do not use indicators, i do look at fibs and use them in the conventional way. What i am seeing here is a complete strategy. I want to thank you for your generosity. I think I need to read and reread this a few times to comprehend it.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Glad to have you. We are all about the complete learning process and from the few items of yours I read, I think you get it. Good Luck, PT

--- 帖子 #325 ---
You say right, this system opens my newbie eyes days ago and i'm working on it to gain better advantages.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I have been contemplating your advice for the past few hours and the more i think about it the more sense it makes to my simple mind. Indeed, the sole aim of trading (for me at least) is to make money. It doesn't matter what the trend is, it doesn't matter how strong or weak the trend. What matters is my ability to spot it early and trade it. From the superficial reading of this thread it appears you have put up a strategy which makes the task of establishing s/r reasonably simple. In a nutshell i don't have to spend hours trying to figure out the trend. I just wait for the break out of the zone, be it support or resistance and take the trade. This simple yet comprehensive strategy appeals to my rather limited intellect. Thanking you for changing the chip.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
In your Forex journey you will find that nothing is as it appears. This method, while it seems simple, is actually very complex. There are only a few people out there making a living and millions trading so when you do the math you will find it is not at all easy or simple. This thread is a great place to start because we will help you with the basics and in my humble opinion, everything begins there. Your observations about S/R are right on the money though. When you can isolate S and R you can then be prepared to take the trade in whichever direction price takes you. Trade as much in demo as possible and then trade in small amounts when the money is real. Good Luck, PT

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Sorry ! had not time to post yesterday..but here my trade for now ! (Ignore the Fibs..they are wrong) !

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Indeed it is, you quite rightly inform the reader at the outset that in order to succeed one must be aware of and incorporate sound money management, longer term fib levels as well as your strategy. Practising sound money management in itself is quite complex.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi PT, Did a trade in my demo account based on your strategy . Went long in Cable at 2.0534. The reasoning was that it had bounced of the 38.2% retracement level of yesterday, and the next likely resistance on the chart was the 38.2% of( Aug 17 1.9651 to the high of 2.1159).I placed my stop at 2.0518, below the 50% level of (1.9879 to the high2.1159). Took profit rather prematurally at 2.0583, the above mentioned 38.2 fib. Of course the market went higher ans higher. Nevermind, mustn't grumble a profitable trade with a 2.1 reward/risk ratio i will it take any day. Early days yet. Now how i wish i had taken that trade in my real account.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I was Stopped out on my Cable Trade for BE..missed the ReEntry for a long but managed to get into an good Geppy Entry for 116 Pips (it reached 240Pips for while but i was not arround ) Here my Shot:

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Plenty of time to trade the real account. Good job on this one. PT

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Great Job here and nice post. Your charts are set up different but I like the concept. Keep it up. PT

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Beside 2 other Indics(only for visualizing) and the Daily Pivots in which way are they different ? Please tell me actually i thaught i am on the same map as u besides some visual enhancements lol !

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Here is what we have been looking at this morning. We had a good break long and it was made a better break because it was the high of Moday. When you get a break of Fibs and a high of the day, you are usually going to get some pips. Here you had an opportunity for 80 +

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I was speaking of visually here. The charts look good. PT

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Now here is a chart with the fibs drawn after the first break. Notice we had a bounce down to the 38.2. This is a common place to retrace to if we are going to continue the move up and we did. PT

--- 帖子 #338 ---
okay ! now i am relaxed again ..thx !

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Here is the current chart with the new Zone started. I feel much better about this Zone than yesterdays because it falls between the 0 and the 38.2 retracement so far and this is a perfect setup for a break in either direction.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Here is a look at the 4hr chart. Notice the blue trend line. It was major support and had held for a few weeks. This is why we refer to the longer time frames for a peek at the big picture. Notice what happened when we broke that line. PT

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Here is the Zone for Geppy ! It also fits superb between the Fibs like on PT`s Cable Pics..

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I think it will be much easier to trade tonight. Yesterday's zone was very wide. Good job on Fibs and charts. PT

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Here is a current 4hr chart and notice a few things. First we broke another major trend line long although this one is not quite as strong as the one we broke short. Also notice we have stalled around the 38.2 fib of the down move. This could be a good place to turn and continue the downward trend but it could also blow it out and go long. Most important thing is this is a great place for a break. PT

--- 帖子 #344 ---
sorry..don`t get it..break =pause,consolidation OR break of the blue 38.2 or the black 61.8? Please define .. edit:Or the break of the zone..yep thats it for sure : right?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I use the 4 hr to get a look at what is happening over a longer period of time. The short term moves are always just a part of the big picture so you have to know the fibs on the daily and 4hr to have a better guess at where we are heading. Now the break of the trend line is when we get a candle on the other side. Consolidation is when price gathers in one area and ranges. This is what we trade, the break out of consolidation. PT

--- 帖子 #346 ---
here my new entry..geppy broke the box .. 4H Picture: Imho Price is clearly consolidating between last weeks lows and this Weeks Pivot ! So there should be some Potential to the downside now.. EDIT: I was stopped out for 6 pips or so and then it fell like a rock ..arghh.. I Entered again @ around 226.65 Yep i also look often at 4H(where i trade the cornflower since a while) daily and weekly.. I just was confused because of the term break..now its clear..great to hear from soebody else the stuff i am doing in analyzing is good.. thx for helping me PT !!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Was stopped out again on geppy..seems 75pip stop level is still not enuff to let it breathe.. i love this beast haha..

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Wrong time of the day. I do not like to take trades past 18 or 19 GMT unless there is some major event happening. PT

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Here is my current Zone going into tonights trading. It is from the high of today back to the 38.2 fib retracement. I may tighten it up to the 23.6 area if we stay in this tight range above it. PT

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Absolutely..i should sit on my hands now and wait for London Open!

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Here is our current chart. I have narrowed the Zone to go from the previous high until just recently to the 23.6. Be careful on the break of this high. Be sure you get a break and not just penetration of the Zone. You should get a good candle moving above or below to enter. Remember this is a Holiday week in the US and things will probably be a little strange. Be smart!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
This is exactly what I was talking about in my previous post. You need confirmation before entering a trade. I only enter on penetration when there is serious price action.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Good Morning Everyone ! I have been stopped out 2 times on Geppy @ demo because i could not sit on my hands...Finally i entered G/J Short and Cable short on an 350 Euro Life Account (Problem is min. 0.1Lot (10k) so 40Pip Stop on G/U means 10% of capital at least for the first few trades) Attached my screens for both ! (I also shorted some Pips out of E/J)

--- 帖子 #354 ---
GPB/JPY Target HIT ! EUR/JPY SL moved to BE! GPB/USD around BE ..still waiting for more bearish powers Edit : G/J flew 70pips over target..i Opened another Postion to take adavantage of another huge fall.. Next Big Support : 221.50-221.00 EUR/JPY around +41Pips ..still some 40Pips to Target GPB/USD around +20Pips to +30pips

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Eur/Jpy Target HIT !! GPB/USD around +50pips! New opened G/J around +42Pips Both SL moved to BE! And here take a look @ Yen Futures! Japanese Housewifes buying yen lol ..bye bye CarryTrade (added 0.1 lot Short GPB/USD as there are still 100pips until Target..) EDIT: To avoid confusion..Pund weakness is mostly because of the MFC Meeting Minutes..Pound Hurt by Gieve MPC Vote Shock..( I personally cannot judge this yet but i did not expect that action ..as the news came in as forecasted)

GPB/USD Daily Candle Broke 38.2 Eyeing 50.0

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Little behind posting today. You can see based on my previously posted chart we broke the Zone short and had a run for around 100 pips. The strategy works. PT

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Great job and you are getting some serious pips. One caution! Resist the temptation to take too many trades. Once you have hit your targets, make sure you don't see a trade where is none. You are doing a great job, keep up the great work and posts. PT

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Took the bounce off the 38.2 fib and just closed for another 20 pips. Good day! PT

--- 帖子 #360 ---
You`re right on the temptation to trade..thats a thing i still have not under controll sufficently ..but i think that comes with practive..at least i hope Thank you very much PT ! Your words mean a lot for an aspiring youngster like me ...may i ask how long you`re at this game and how long it did take you to "breathe" the Powertrading Method? ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here my actual River entrys , i am sorry i could not make an finishing post of the last trades (i made some dumb mistakes and actually only made 50pips lol) ..and will not repost them in respect of the order of posts...could become confusing..but will try to explain those new trades when they are finished. After seeing Yen Futures breaking out to the short side and after reading some stuff think Eur/jpy and aud/jpy are fundamentally the strongest, i decided to trade the river with them as they are the best for an strong rebound..dont want to trade against the bearish pound..the weekly channel still has some potential to the downside.. Here the screens! Black Fibs are The Fibs of the last Move (15mins); Blue are 4H Fibs and MediumSpringGreen is Daily Chart Fib..

Ohh i forgot Happy Thanksgiving everyone

Happy Thanksgiving! PT

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Update on Positions..Both were stopped out for BE sometimes today.. (aud/jpy ran up to around 70pips (but i was not around to secure some of them) It ran up top the 38.2 of the last downmove and then fell again!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
My GPB/JPY Entry for today..entry is a bit early and i dont expect Target 2 to be hit..but maybe Target 1 comes near..

Here what i think about cable today..

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Sometimes things run too perfect i missed to enter on cable(seems this day is a river trade day though) Notice the how the 38.2Fib on geppy is halting the momentum! Pictures say a thousand words! Firs Pic :Geppy 2nd Pic : Cable Can somebody please tell me how i can sort the text to the right Picture? I mean Text Pic Text Pic Sometimes i dont know how to explain myself

--- 帖子 #367 ---
What the heck there were 75+Pips as i went away..so fast the tide can turn..maybe i will watch for an reentry if trend resumes! But this thing was VEEERY fast at least to fast for me to take some profits..you go out for a smoke and think thats sure 50pips you have in your pockets,and in the blink of an eye the market makes you humble.. I remember i wondered why there is only reaction on geppy and other japs didnt move that much north..this was an hint to be prepared to take profits early..dont you love this job guys..lessons everyday Now i will consume some chocolat to make the missed cable move worth it..there are still lots of opportunites comin`..hope there is enuff chocolat for me to survive missin`them

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I am in a reversal now. I am expecting the 2.0700 area to be a tough area to get through. This could be a quick retracement and we could bounce right back up if the big boys want to take us long. Otherwise I will expect this to run back to at least the 38.2 area of the total up move. Fibs are a little out of whack because of gap and it is why I kept the last up swing which was two days. I made 25 pips on the break out long tonight based on the high of yesterday and it was the top of my zone. I caught it a little late or it was worth 50+.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Just closed my short trade for another 30 pips on the day. This is now 55 for the day. We bounced off the 38.2 fib level and started back up. Not sure if this is a continuation of the up move or not but I am done trading for a while. Going to sit on my hands with my 55 pips in the bank and go to to sleep. PT

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi PowerTrader, Todays price action was very confusing to me in the london session. I know the market tried to go higher, failed and fell. The question is rather general, but do you have any extra mental filters which give you a hint that perhaps we are going lower/higher.?I mean is there any candle pattern that you look for or anything else that you use apart from the break out of the zone? I hope i have been able to ask an understandable and answerable question. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Well we had a pretty good break on the upper end of the zone and then when it turn back we had a bounce off the 38.2 Fib. It can sometimes be difficult to know when price is turning. I think yesterday was more difficult coming off the Holiday. I will sometimes look for a candle with a long wick and a few going the opposite direction to trigger the turn. I always want some confirmation, patience will help you most. PT

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi PT, I guess i need to study candle action this weekend. One observation that i have made is that price always, well almost always makes a 123 pattern before making the move in the London open. Often the market is taken to the opposite direction first. Perhaps you can shed some light on this point. Anyway Have a good weekend and thank you for all the help and tips this week. DD

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Here is an overview of todays action. We broke out of the Zone in the Asian session last evening. The top of the Zone was also the previous days high. I caught it a little late and only got a portion. I made 25 pips on this move. I then took a reversal at the top and made another 30 pips. When we broke short I was sleeping and did not hear the alert so I missed that entire move. Finally I caught some of the retrace from that move and made another 11 pips. This should have been one of those days to make 100 + but I was only able to get 66 total. I am posting the chart from the entire trading day and you can see the moves. I have the final fib pool of the day but imagine the different swings and fib placement for the day. You will never get all of the pips available in a day but you certainly could have made some today. PT

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I think i need to be more frequent on this site to have a through learning section about your method. am catching it gradually and am doing very fine with it. thanks

--- 帖子 #375 ---
How was your weekend? Please could you do a PDF files that explained your strategy in details for your students to study? thanks

Hi all, I have a very bad cold so I was unable to post yesterday. I will try to get some charts up tonight before things break loose. PT

--- 帖子 #377 ---
hehe ! i have also a terrible cold and had some pretty strange days. i will also post some charts sometimes but for now i let PT have the first move Here only a River240 on Gold ! Entry on Friday !

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thats an great idea IMHO and i would volunteer to help you with anything if i can PT!

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I am posting the chart of our current situation and I will explain my thinking. I think we must defer to the 4hr chart at this time and there are two very strong areas of support and resistance. The resistance or the point where you would take a long is at 2.0762 and I would like to see a candle open above that number to go long. I think we will run at least 80 pips or more if we pass that point. The area of support or the point where you would take a short position is under the 2.0700 area and probably about 2.0685. Now this is different than our Zone is currently but it will be the point where I place my trades. Remember, this is based on my interpretation of the charts and I respect that others may come to a different conclusion. PT

--- 帖子 #380 ---
If you are watching the charts on the Gbp/Usd you will see the importance of my last post. We are in a wide area of range and we could still break in either direction. You must have confirmation before entering a trade. Be careful and be smart trading today. PT

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Pt, how is your health now? and hope all is well with you.... please do take care of yoour self.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Here my Chart for the cable ! As sometimes price makes it hard to draw nice Zones, then I draw seperate levels with the same tool! EDIT: The Black Fibs are NOT the Fibs of the Last Move but for the whole upmove of last week ! But analysis stays the same! Sorry for not beeing that concentrated today! But overall i am 100% supportive of PT´s Plan for today! He`s a great teacher If somebody wonders that i dont throw out any Geppy charts today..there was a news related(Yen Falls as Citigroup Sells Stake, Reviving Carry Trade Demand) ) spike through the river and this is beyond my stage of fx education so i probably will leave the yaps at the side today! This action scared me lol

Thank you for the kind words. I am still feeling a little bad and this is the reason for few posts. I hope to feel better soon. Again thank you, PT

Did anybody acutally notice my FAT FAT error on the charts ! Trading is a lot about concentration and it seems i loose alot of it because i am sick and my thoughts are somewhere else .. I will add my thaughts the coming days BUT will not trade them..!! Please forget that Gold Trade (was stopped out @ BE -10€ for comission(demo)) AS IT WAS ON AN 1H CHART...i simply traded what i saw and i even wrote "here my river entry from last friday"..unbelievable..on an 4H Chart (WHICH IS TO BE USED FOR RIVER240 ) this of course looks completely the other way.. I take this as a clear sign i should relax and first get the girls outta my head before ENTERING Trades .. But as i said i will watch and comment as this and next Week are imho quite telling about the fundamental and general market sentiment ! Added the River240 Chart to let everybody see how fu**** i was today EDIT:will add Pic later..my inet sucks (but strangely only in my browser )

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I have not been commenting on the 240 river because I wanted people to learn the basics and fibonacci before they are into new things. But you remember it and are smart to watch. I will be putting the 240 in play very soon and it is a big part of the total PowerTrading method. PT

What would be some good signals that there is a false river break?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
You need to have Price Action to enter a trade. In other words and this normally does not happen in the beginning of the day GMT time till the early European session. In that time period Price Action is slow and trades normally should not be entered. So to answer your question, you must have Price Action and break Support or Resistance to effectively trade. Others may differ on this point but that is my opinion. PT

Hey Comego, Good to see you. PT

Looks like you guys are having fun in here! And making pips too! Thanks for bringing this to my attention PT. I used to demo this system a little over a year ago but it wasn't what I was looking for at the time. Just started demo trading again and i'm up 170 pips on GJ just today.I love the box addition. It helps determine the type of market your in. I'm still learning how touse fibs correctly. Do you use the fib from yesterdays high and low or just the most recent swing high/low? I've heard both be commented on. Anyway thanks. And keep posting, you never know how many non-posters are watching and learning!! Jar

Hello Pt, I hope you are getting better? We've missed your ever consistence presence in this thread and the other site. we are still waiting for the PDF file explaining your strategy thanks

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I just completed this trade and I am going to walk you through the process. Here is where we broke the zone. Notice where my sell order is located.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Notice once in profit, I set a stop loss locking in 5 pips and set my target which was the 61.8 fib.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
As I moved further into profit, notice how I moved the SL with me. Also make note it is just behind the recently past fib area.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Gaining more profit and getting very close my target. Noticed I pulled my TP out because it was running pretty fast.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Here I am with a closed position and 70 pips in the bank. Obviously it ran for another 30 but I hit my target. I could have continued to move the SL forward and if I had slept any I probably would have. I will take 70 pips on any one trade and now I am heading to sleep. The Zone Breakout works and you can follow my charts for proof. PT

Hi guys ! sorry was away for some family problems well now i am back and see alot fo changes in this thread / system anyway i will do the same what i do before give the trades which will give by this system and making some nice trades and earning some nice money with them hope u all like it and main POWERTRADER u r the best here is the picture of my todays trading Enter Short from 228.04 in the morning and targetting the next fibo 226.86 +118 pips in pocket thanks Netwise

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Welcome back Netwise! Here is how i would have traded the geppy today! My entry would have been a bit later around 227.90 (where my alarm was set) and as usual i would have had 2 Profit Targets ! Both would have been hit ! Great to see somebody else trading the geppy ! (If u find somebody who can create an EA i would also be interested..but i guess it will be pretty hard as "the river" is surely not pure technical method as the human eye can create Zones easy ,and a computer cannot..and if u put them out ,u only have a 62SMA/Envelope Cross System..technically i would not like that system..but together with PA ,Zones,Fibs and common sense its really great imho..but those things are dependant on exp. and this u only get with SCREEN TIME ) BTW somebody catched the move from yesterday ? i only watched it and cursed myself because i said i stop trading that were some easy 400pips lol EDIT: (the black Fibs are the upswing beginning with the low @ 11/23)

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Price Action imho lies only in the CandleSticks and Bars! Check the James16Chart thread and read it through..it will help u alot on your journey ! Because in the end all indicators (no matter what complex formula) are derived from Price so for me Price is the only leading indicator..i know i still use indicators ,but they are more of a visual for me..i seldom rely on those! And also i am still a noob

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I think i will compile a pdf (of course only with PT`s allowance). But for now let`s wait for all the stuff that PT will introduce in the complete PT method..in a few weeks (maybe month?) i think i will have a good sense of the method in the different timeframes used ,and so i will be able to create a complete PDF..but for now imho we are still at the basics..so lets learn and see If u have any questions feel free to state them here and i will try to answer them for you..most stuff is @ post #1 also if u haven`t read it..

--- 帖子 #408 ---
@ PT I hope its okay with you that i try to answer some questions posted for you ?! I was not sure if you did`nt notice them and/or are still fighting with your cold

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Have a quick question about the river trade and stops. If you are in a trade and get a signal in the other direction before the stop is hit do you close the first trade? Also, could you please refer me to the post #s in which you explain how to draw and trade the "zone"? Also, the river will work on timeframes higher than 15min correct? I would think it works even better. Do you need to make any changes from the 15min?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
It would be good to just read through the thread after we started talking about the Zone and the first page. I am posting a chart of where price is consolidating now and where I have started drawing the Zone. The box is now drawn between the low of the day (0 fib) and the 23.6 retrace. We continue to draw the Zone until price actions starts to gain momentum. In other words when you see the candles start getting bigger this is a sign. Always wait for confirmation if it happens early. If the candles continue to be small, simple expand the Zone if any of the break through. It is a combination of Fibonacci, Price Action and Time of Day that allows us to isolate price and thus create the Zone. PT

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Ok, so fib is taken between the high and low of the day. Then the zone is drawn between the 0 and 26%? Also, I know it may seem trivial but could you please help me with these other questions: If you are in a trade and get a signal in the other direction before the stop is hit do you close the first trade? The river will work well on timeframes higher than 15min correct? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Glad to see Rivers are still flowing. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thanks DownRiverTrader, Our method is PowerTrading but the River was one of our trades using the 62 envelope. We still use the setup but trade a Zone Breakout and not the cross. Our method is based on Fibonacci, Price Action, Support and Resistance, Trend Lines, and Money Management. I am not sure if we resemble your method but thank you for the encouragement for our thread. PT

--- 帖子 #414 ---
I use all the time frames to confirm what is happening in the 15 min. I like using the 15 because it breaks down the hour and we can get into a trade and may have missed it on the hour. As for Stop Loss, here is my method. If we break low from the Zone we have now, I would place a stop on the other side of the 23.6 providing it is no more than 40 pips. If we break low tonight I would probably wait for a candle to form on the other side because it is the low of yesterday and almost the low of the day before. But yes, if you break the wrong way, take the loss. Losses should be no more than 40 pips although you will use your own discretion as you become more familiar with this method. PT

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Marolam, I will try to answer your questions too but i will use an geppy chart for this.. 1. Yeah take the loss..i found that the stops which are hit ocassionally do not really hemper what u experience on volatile days..1 winner in my experience mostly weights up 2 loosers..on geppy sometimes the ratio is higher... and since my problem still is to be patient and let all factors align i found beeing impatient leads to much more stops hit.. i learn to never try to get the whole move...if there is a big move with lots of potential its starring me in the eye and i move stops from fib to fib and/or use my target zones and if i am unsure i am absolutely greateful for 1/3 to 1/4 of the move. there are possiblities every new day ..learn to draw the zones also for the last days and give them different thickness to seperate between strong and weak sup/res...often when u zoom out or change the TF you get great target areas..then I take the mid of the last peak/valley consolidation as target and it is hit almost 75%..it`s kinda the same as James16 PPZ...if there is not an clear rangebound zigzag consolidation i use trendlines (yeah very discretionary method i know ).. 2. I personally did not check the other TF`s with the river15 (of course they look good at a first view but no exp there) But i love the River240 method ! of course there is an other configuration for the Envelope ! Pt will get to this soon as he said a few posts ago ! But be slow and grow (but i will add a chart too for you as the basic technique is the same for example: Zones,Fibs on 4H, Daily..) Okay i try to get some clearer view in the chart.. But here my actual geppy entry! EDIT NEW: I added an entry for River240 on Crude BUT this is just for an example..I personally would not short Crude at this time and only look for opportunities to buy cheap..but it should work as an example! Will add more text later!

Hey Aidan ! hows u bro hows ur wss going well ya i just do tradeing with GJ using River well also ya i catch that move from 226.12 area thats my fib i long it and target was 227.12 +100 pips that was reached by yesterday already heheh today i got 2 trades i loss -44. then i re long gj and targetting now 228.15 so lets see thanks for the welcome back Netwise

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Make sure you trade smart today. It is Friday and anything can happen on Friday. Get confirmation if we break long, I think I will not enter until we get past the 38.2 retrace of yesterdays move. PT

Here is a better look.

Update on my Trades !

--- 帖子 #420 ---
I am fine thx ! Wss was also fine but doesnt suit my style..i`ve come along way since then congratz on your trades and pips ! the winners will outweight the losses for sure! Congratz on your 228.15 target..should be hit by now ..i got some more ! Kind regards, Aidan

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Target Hit : 155Pips ! Gimme just 4 such Trades a month and i am happy as Goldilocks Now lets see what cable does as G/J fights with big RES until 229.20 area ! EDIT: Cable broke out PT`S Entry Zone and G/J is fightin 229.20 hard.. now i watch geppys price action for (MAYBE) playing the retracement..but that has nothing to do with the river!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
One can also always watch Yen futures to get a hint for the yaps ! In this case it was starring you in the eye ..also the 229.20 Resistance is "mirrored" here ! (its River240 Setup but 1H Chart so ignore it there)

--- 帖子 #423 ---
My cable was stopped out for +8 Pips ! Enuff for today ! but watching the action ..(btw g/J mini-retracement could have been 40-60pips but i did not take it ..be happy with what you got when its more than BE for a day ..and today it was much more !)

--- 帖子 #424 ---
As PT said on Friday`s strange things hapen lol Here a "end-of-week" Entry with Cable ,which i "missed to watch" because i was outside my castle... please pay attention that this is an "entry-with-the-flow" ..normally you wait for one candle to CLOSE outside the River..but with exp u can take such entry as strong momentum suggests more potential (even though one should use smaller positions for such ) would have been good for 30-60 pips, EDIT: maybe 90 Pips EDIT: Cable just hit 2nd imagenary target..next BIG suport 2.0500-2-.0515 imho ! also the retracement on geppy seems to have more potential do the downside...i will wait and see if it can break support (Also Yen F @ medium Support)..but won`t trade anymore as i said..

--- 帖子 #425 ---
@ Marolam! I edited post #415 further! will add more but time is scarce btw Cable retraced like a 1 @ the 4H (blue) 23.6 Fib..it was a great target

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Does PowerTrading work? I am posting the actual results of our live audited account for the month of November. We had more losses this month and our win ration was down but our pip count was up. Plug in your value to the pip count and estimate what you could make. We have now completed 3 months on this account and it has grown just under 35%. This is a fantastic rate of growth. If you invested 100,000 you would now have a profit of approximately 35,000. What other investment will give you these kind of returns and remember, our Money Management is very conservative. November Overview 575 Positive pips for the month Averages: 144 pips per week 46 of 55 Positive trades 84% Success Rate

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Just to compare. October Overview 448 Positive pips for the month Averages: 112 per week 10 out of 10 Positive trades 100% Success Rate September Overview 422 Positive pips for the month Averages: 105.5 per week 23 out of 25 Positive trades 92% Success Rate

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi PT ! because of the month of OKTOBER! may i ask why there where only 10 trades? also those Stats are only for GPB/USD ! right? excuse me if this was allready answered in earlier posts!

--- 帖子 #429 ---
PT, Well done. You are doing an excellent job in demonstrating to the less experienced traders, how following a clearly defined trading strategy with sound money management is all one needs to succeed. Whats more impressive is the fact that these trades are done live. I salute your integrity. DD

--- 帖子 #430 ---
You are correct, there were only 10 trades in October but all were winners. We used a slightly different strategy this month and traded much more. We had more losses but also made more pips. Yes this is on GBP/USD only and when we add other pairs you will see the same results and double the pips. Thank you, PT

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Thank you for the kind words DD. It is important for people to see real trading and not hear about 1000 pips per day or even a month. This is real, and you have grasped the main reason for success. Sound Money Management . Without it , even the best trading method will fail. I hope we have put a realistic face on professional trading and people are learning. I never make any decisions quickly or based on one piece of information. To be successful you need to learn all the basics I have mentioned. PT

hi Guys! attached here with the chart on which i trade well do 3 trades and 2 win and 1 loss let me give u my trades of friday Sell 226.40 Target 225.40 SL 227.00 ( SL hit - 60 ) Long GJ 227.44 Target 228.15 ( fib 61.8 ) SL 226.84 ( Target Hit +74 ) Short GJ Again from 229.00 Targetting again 61.8 fib 228.15 Target Hit +85 pips again thats the trades for me which my River gives to me River is the best of the best POWERTRADER thanks to you bro u introduce this - 60 +74 +85 Total pips 159 pips on Friday i am sure its a good performance good luck Netwise

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Admittedly maths has never been one of my stronger points, but, -60+74+85= 159.. I think not old chap. Me thinks 99 . Still well done. DD

--- 帖子 #434 ---
We broke out of the Zone long early and ran about 50 pips from my original Zone. I set my SL just above break even and was stopped out when it turned, my only 3 pips. When we entered into the Zone on the way back down, I took a short position and kept moving the stop each time we went 10 pips lower, finally it came back and stopped me at at 44 pips profit. We had news out at 4:30 and it was good for the GBP and has moved us back up, at least in the short term. If we break low or high of my box again, I will enter in either direction. For now I will catch some sleep with my 47 pips in the bank. PT

ahahaha i am really really very sorry ya its total 99 pips i am really sorry thanks for cathc the mistake bro THANK U netwise

Hello guys... help me to understand further this river trading method... If possible does anybody have a pdf format explaining everything about river trading method....To me it's amazing comparing with other method of trading I've tried and tested before.... Problem to me is "the entry and the exit point". I'm still sort of crawling to get hold of this. I wanna master this trading method. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I do not have a pdf and will not create one. This method is understand the basics of trading. There is not any one trade the will make you successful in my opinion. You must be prepared with knowledge to tak action under any circumstance. You can look back at the posts and see some of my entry and exit moves. PT

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Good setup for tonight. The high of the day and the 38.2 retrace. Be careful that we have good Price Action when we break through the Zone. If not wait a little before placing your trade. Better to be late, than be wrong. Just trade smart, lock in profit as soon as possible and the the worst you can do is make one or two pips. That is what I did on the first break last night and then I had a chance to come back and get my pips later. Good Trading, PT

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I know this is a little different than what we normally look at in here but it is important to the entire method. The 4hr is a good way to see what is happening in the big picture. Sometimes things are happening too fast in the 15 min and you need to step back and look at the overall picture. Notice where I have the crucial trend line market. That is a horizontal trendline and it has been strong resistance several times. I also have other trend lines drawn and you should be doing this too. You can see they fan downward and each one will be support. The trend lines with the most touches and have held the longest amount of time will be the strongest. So when you are stalling out on the 15 min or hour and you want to know why, here you go. Practice this, it will make you a strong trader. Also run Fibs. PT

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hello PT(Pretty Teacher) Hmm, this is another techniques you are teaching here to add to my weapon arsenal but will need more lectures on this, presently, am already studying trendlines and how it can be drawn. We need more explanations but be rest assured that in no time it will be well understood. Your student

Hello all Can somebody tell me the effect of this period(december) on trading? I've heard series of discussion about it. people said its always a ranging month because of low volume. can somebody confirm this to me. thanks

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hey guys, PT, netwise: ya'll are really doing good. I can find the zones, its pretty easy on gbpusd on 15 tf. What keeps happening is my entries get activated and then reverse on me. I guess I have them too close but ya'll seem to get better entries than me. How can you determine when a breakout will occur and estimate good targets? Do you know any good articles/books on price action. I'm also reading the fibonnaci thread by bobo here to try and help. Any other ideas? TIA and Good Luck!! Jar

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I just took a quick short position for some quick pips.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
It is important to wait until there is Price Action. Sometimes the wrong time of day will kill you. This week is difficult because it will be non-farm payroll on Friday and that always makes the week crazy. My pips are coming from the Gbp/Usd, but these other guys are hitting home runs with the other pairs. I am satisfied with my usual daily pips because I know I will get them and I can put more money on each pip. PT

--- 帖子 #449 ---
When you say "price action" you mean the price bars are giving you clues as to direction? The only thing I can tell from them right now is when there are longer wicks usually you have indecision in the market or a large in bar retracement. But by the time I see them I've missed the move. Any way, keep posting guys i'll learn. Thanks for taking time to help!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I am talking about activity. You can not make decisions when there is no activity in the market. If you take trades too early or late in the day there is nothing to tell you the direction. We had two breakouts of the Zone today on the Gbp/Usd, both for about the same amount of pips. It was easy to do the Zone, you simply put it between the High of yesterday and the 38.2 retrace because that is where price consolidated when the action was slow. Hope this helps. PT

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Price Action: Normally, our fibo is drawn from the previous day high and low(sometimes, recent high and low) and the zone box is drawn where there is price consolidation(you might saying when price is ranging or where there is indecision between buyers and sellers) It is expected that price will break-out from the zone on either side of the zone, but a picture from bigger time frame like 4hrs should be able to give a clue where the price will go after the breakout(anyway, that's speculations) That's all in summary about our method, probably, the professor(PT) might want to add more but this is just the 'piece meal' from a fellow newbie like you. The reversal, is for guru, still learning it but the trend changing candle stick around the golden ratio is a sign that reversal is possible.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi guys ! nice to see you made pips today! my schedule is still very uncertain and crazy so today i could not do any trades.. I just wanted to add to PT`s 4H chart that the river which is visible there is the 240River .i will now add the config und hope it`s okay with PT ..i just dont want anyone to be confused ! Settings are 240 Period Envelop (Simple) with an 0,06 Deviation applied to close! Because of Price action ! Study James16 Chart Thread &amp; Stuf ! His teachings are gold and greatly apply to the PT method! Hope I can post&amp;trade tomorrow! All the best !

Good to see you. I was wondering where you had been. Good trading, PT

We have currently broken yesterdays low and I took a short but let me tell you what is happening. There is a horizontal trend line on the 4hr chart that has 15 4hr candles touching this area since it has be broken short. It is a tough area. I will post my 15 chart. I do not have a Zone because we did not slow down to consolidate. Make sure you look at that 4hr and draw a trend line horizontally from our current price so you can see what I am talking about. PT

I had a huge night. I am still adding the pips but on this trade alone I had 150 plus. I am over 200 for the night on same strategy as before. If you looked at 4hr chart it was an amazing break of support. I entered at the break of yesterday's low. It backed up a little and then went wild. I did not have time to place the Zone.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
The Powertrading break out worked and allowing the trade to run by moving stops up as we kept breaking new ground allowed me to get the maximum pips. PT

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hi all, closed out my positions this morning with 272 Pips for the night. Amazing night. What a drop. I will post some other charts later. We broke long term support and by using the 4hr chart with trend lines, I was able to identify the probability of a big run. These Pips are from real trades on our live audited account. PT I hope everyone had a great night.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
very very nice congrats for ur great pips good luck

--- 帖子 #467 ---
This is the same 4hr chart I posted before. The bottom of the box or 4hr Zone had been tested and touched by 16 4hr candles until it broke today. The angled trend lines below were strong support and two went back months with multiple touches. This information will make you a full time trader once you learn it. PT

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Netwise, i am not trying to be awkward....but are you not going against the system. Please correct me if i am wrong but the system is break out of the zone north, one should go long and south one should go short. The market has broken out to the south and you are going long. I pose these questions for my own clarification as well as other less experienced traders out there. Your clarification or justification for that trade would be most helpful. Thanks and good luck. DD

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hey DD, Netwise may be a little early with his long position but you will probably see me take a long position later in the day. After a drop of 200 pips you will get some retrace. I would imagine a minimum of 50 pips but probably more. If you pull fibs we will retace to at least the 23.6, and probably the 38.2 even if we are going to continue the drop. PT

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Thanks for a nice question bro well first of all i wana say that we need 2 charts 15m and 4h. first of all we just cant see the 15m chart to trade the River we also need to see the 4h chart too and in 4h u will see that bottom is reached in gj and probably we will see wome upward movement may be i m wrong or may be i cant clarify my things but i took the long as per river rulesz bro that how i trade the river and make successful trading some times lossess too so may be if i am doing wrong this time i loss but i do what i see in my river charts hope its clear something if u have any more questions please surely let me know i am waiting thanks netwise

--- 帖子 #471 ---
in addition of the above post ====================== well what i exp with the River in 15 m charts we see waves of the river and well my exp told me that when the price go down from the waves it should come back in the waves so when i took long its breaks the waves of the river and thats why its the basic reason why i took long coz it will go back for sure in the waves of the river secondly when u see 4h chart and when u see price action u see gj touched the bottom ( on that time ) a little thing i wana tell that pur rsi ( i will tell u my setting for it ) and see the 4h u see that rsi is already on the bottom of the chart its also help to u trade with the river bro DD i hope that u understand my things well if i am not clear and if u want any thing else which u wana ask i am here thanks netwise

--- 帖子 #472 ---

Remember my friends there is much news out this week and it affects the price. Some times people only look at technicals (the charts) and forget about the news. It is important to know when a major announcement will be made and hopefully you will be positioned so you do not lose big in such a case. PT Remember Non-Farm Payroll tomorrow in US!

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hello guys, I think it is the best time i give somethng back to this forum. am not scared trading during NPF because i make money trading at this time. Strategy: We all know that volatility is always high during this period. so at exactly 5mins before the news. I place buy/sell order at 25pips away from the market price. SL=50 TGT=75 when one of the buy/sell is hit, i close the order. Hope you demo trade this tomorrow and let me have your result. NB: This is also applicable to other major news like Interest rates thanks

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Thx for the input and please don`t take any offense..but this Thread is not about Straddling techniques ! there are lots of other threads for this! Also forget demo trading this ! especially for this demo is useless as u will get always an perfect fill @ ur prices in STARK contrast to an live account! imho straddling has become an suckers game! wish u good luck for tomorrow anyways! (if u pm me i have some EA`s for this which will straddle your config automtically..)

Good week everyone. I am finished for the week with over 340 pips in the bank. Non-farm was pretty dull but now it is time to stop trading and enjoy the weekend. PT

Hey PT Tried many times to register on web site on two different computers and couldn't get it done. Kept saying string I typed in didn't match. Had several people try it but no luck. Any other way to register? Thanks Mombone

Broke the Zone which was also the high of Friday. I move the stop into profit right away. It went as high as 40 + Pips so far and I moved the stop to more profit. It moved back on me and stopped me out with 27 Pips profit. This is the way to keep those positive pips and make sure something will be in the bank if it backs up.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Just another shot as I moved the stop further, but it is closed now.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I will be posting charts a little later. Remember we have interest rate news coming out tomorrow afternoon, US time. PT

--- 帖子 #491 ---
TP, Thanks for the River, I'm adding it to my charts and it will surly help. I found that when the 45 SMA crosses the 62 SMA it is a good signal to exit. It's just what I noticed on the 15m TF. I don't like using Fab. levels...they never work for me. I used a white dash line for the 62 and dark gray dashes for the 45, that way the charts are not so busy. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
It is good to notice as many patterns as possible for exiting. I use fibonacci for the most part to determine exit. I find a fib bounce is almost always the end of any run. Thanks, PT

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Good morning everyone! Just wanted to let ya know i am still around and will continue to do so But my schedule is still a bit chaotic so please excuse that i cannot post everyday ! Big THX @ PT for still educating us all Today i would have time but i am (IMHO) uncertain of the markets behaviour because of the FED Rate Cut and i will only watch the charts today...but if I see something obvious i will trade and post..!! Happy day everyone !

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Look at today and yesterday. Break of Zone = Pips! PT

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Just closed my short position for the day. Total of 60 pips today on the break out. You really had to look at your fibs today to get the best out of today.

Learn to trade. There are no quick solutions. I am sitting on 400 plus pips for the month trading one pair. Is that enough? You tell me what value you could put on each pip. And there is still more month. Fibonacci, Price Action, Trend Lines, Support and Resistance and Money Management. There are great threads all over FF on these subjects and I put it all together here.

Greetings all, I have followed this site for over a year now and am happy to say that this is the best method for gaining pips that i have come across. After reading this thread from front to back and back testing this method i am quite certain that it is a winner...my question is how do you interpret the FX Sniper and what does the chime indicate? My compliments to PT for leading the charge with this system.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Good morning everyone! Here my Trades for today! Beware of the news! USDCore CPI m/m USDIndustrial Production m/m As Usual every input is welcome on what i can do better

--- 帖子 #499 ---
My Geppy trade was stopped out ! EDIT: Bad geppy is falling now..just a few pips and i would still be init (did not fall very much fow now) GPB/USD just hit Target 1 EDIT 2 : Closed cable for +21 Pip! Reasons: 1H Chart Triangle and 4H chart FIB Support also this weeks Low is near! EDIT 3: CAD/JPY River15 is breaking north and also my River240 Tradeon u/J is beginnign to get traction! i will not consider any shorts for today anymore..also YEN Futures are considering breaking River240 to the downside! So i begin to be biased to the bullside Let`s wait and see if i can get another trade for BE today !

--- 帖子 #500 ---
okay Cable hit my 2nd Target also but better to be "safe than sorry" I consider to buy the pound now depending on Price Action the next 25minutes (2.0330 area is this weeks Low )..but this has nothing to do with the river! Just btw there might be an possibility for an river240 the next 16hrs on the EUR/USD (if it can fall below 1.4550 with authority) eur/jpy had also a great river15 opportunity if i had noticed it bad i dont have enuff screens heads and hands lol

Hello Aldan... care to share your template with us here ?

Any takers on my question about the sniper indicator and the chime that sounds?? Info would be much appreciated..

Here the continuation of my River240 Trade! Finally i am in Profit too for today... what a shame i closed cable to early and was stopped on GPB/JPY .. both could have been big winners ! Also i missed the Eur/usd River240 Entry would have been great but possiblities are abundant ,aren`t they? I move SL to BE hich is not visivle in the Screenshot yet. Will share my template soon ! @ Sampsun! will try to answer ur question about the FXSniper , but hope PT can give u a better explanation..i am pretty sure i use it another way than most do lol

Hi there... thanks Aidan for the template.....

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Sorry I have not posted for a few days I have been very busy. I will probably slow down posting until January because of Christmas and the market is really ranging. It is setup better for scalping than normal trading but look for at least one more good break before the first of the year. Here is my Zone for tonight. It is large but if we break the low of the day we should run. Keep and eye on the 4hr chart as well.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Pretty easy to tell where the breakout will come on this 4hr chart. Use the fibs to guide your entry.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
hi there everybody... is good to see some more posts of late, dec has been a fairly profitable month, up 680 points for the month so far, just with the straight river from 12pm to 2am EST. i would really appreciate some feedback on the chime and the interpretaion of the sniper??? using the zone breakout is really good on the backtesting but live its all about chart interpretaion, is a bit of a toss up for me at the moment... thanks guys...

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Fantastic results for this month.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I took first trade when we broke a trend line and then afterwards when we broke the Zone and previous low.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Just more of the same move. 70 pips so far!!!

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Still sitting on this one. Just closed this for 45 Pips. 115 for the day!

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Here is why we look at the 4hr chart. When we broke this area it had been very strong support. Anytime you can break an area of strong support on a 4hr chart you will get some pips. I am giving you people some great information here for free. I am one of very few people posting charts with live trades and sometimes as I take them. Please take the time to learn this method and the basics of trading. There are so many good threads here about everything and if you just use the things I teach, you can be successful. I will be posting Decembers results at the end of the month. I have had a great month in chop but there are a few trades to go. Learn to earn!!!!!

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Tonights Zone looks like this. Be careful trading today. We broke some major support last night and the bias is short. Use the 4hr charts as well as the 15 min. Major move down last night so you might expect a little retrace but don't take anything for granted. December is crazy and a lot of people are settling accounts before the end of the year. PT

hi, thx for sharing ur system i wounder how can i get the yellow zone? thx

Once you determine where you are going to place in based on the place of consolidation. You go to insert, shapes, rectangles and drag it where you want it. PT

I will give u some input on the Sniper indicator soon! Also it will help if u check the formula of this indicator..its great for understanding! Also to all i did not post a few days as i am "on the road" but will do again after christmas/new year!! i am also around 250pips for this month (could have been much better imho but beggining january my schedule should work 100% hopefully ) All the best to PT and everbody else !!

Hi Powertrader, I've been lurking in the background for some time now and I've enjoyed watching the development of your method. Here is a GBP short trade I took on Friday. Fibs are pulled from high and low of Thursday. As you can see the 50% fib has not been broken during the early part of the Friday session. I have drawn my breakout box between the resistance line @ 1.9892 and support line @ 1.9863. I entered at the close of the candle marked with the yellow arrow @ 1.9860. Exited @ 1.9828 for +32 pips. Keep in mind the daily range was only 81 pips on Friday.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Here is an overview for next week. We've had a long run down and now it looks like we are in a range between 1.9890 and 1.9810. Not much will happen in the markets next week due to the holidays so my advice is to be very careful if you decide to enter the market. I wouldn't consider entering a trade until the high or low of the range is clearly broken.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Merry Christmas...and merry christmas to me....because this power trading method has improved my trading greatly...thanks pt

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hello PT and other trader on this thread. Please, take a look on the chart I posted below. From what I understand about this method, we open Buy or Sell according the candle open outside of the box. From my below chart, I have some questions : 1. Is it correct the way I draw my box? 2. Is it correct if I took Sell position on the break of the box as I pointed with a line? 4. Is it correct that we also take the buy position after the break above the box? 3. If I am wrong, could someone please correct my mistakes? Thank you for your help.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Even though last week was a holiday week there were still some good trades you just had to be patient. Here is a GBP short trade I took on 24 Dec. As you can see the price action tested the 38% fib several times early in the Monday session but could not break through the 38% fib. This gave me a hint that the market might move lower if it can break the bottom of the box. Fibs are pulled from high to low on Friday. I based drawing my breakout box on the consolidation from early in the day and a strong support line @ 1.9809. I entered on the first bearish candle (red arrow) that closed below the box @ 1.9807 and exited @ 1.9765 for +42 pips.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
There was a penetration below the box before the point you are referring too. I would have pulled my lower box limit down to that point so the second penetration down would not have broken the low of the box keeping you out of this trap. If you don't get a clean break of the box and it's just a penetration pull your box down to that new low created by the penetration and wait for a clean break and close below the box before entering. Again, that is a general rule but there may be times when you have additional information based on your analysis that you would enter before a clean break of the box. Maybe PowerTrader can offer some additional advise on this situation.

Hello Everyone, I am finally back from vacation and ready to post for the New Year. I will be posting Decembers results very soon which were outstanding. In the next few days I will try to get back in the groove of posting. I have been very busy trading and planning for new things this year. I can tell you this. We started our audited account in September and after 4 months of trading, our account has grown 50%. I don't know any other investment opportunity with the potential for this kind of return. PT

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hey Hondakorn, It looks like your boxes are drawn okay. It would be nice to see the days separated so we can tell where the trading day begins and ends. It is important to trade when there is price action and we break a point of consolidation with strong movement. PT

Hello everyone. PT thanks for the system it looks very interesting. I have almost finished reading the thread and have some questions. I took my first trade on G/J, I missed the initial short, but then I saw that price has stucked at the pivot, which was also the boundary of the zone, with up tails indicating selling pressure. I also saw that the bullish candle went through 23.6 Fib level, so I sold two mini lots (demo). The news moved price violently in my direction. I closed one lot +110, the other is set to +60 b/e and still running. What I want to ask what would be the right way to draw Fib in this situation. On my first chart I cought the last move up, but I'm not sure as in this case I should have looked for long? The second chart represents yesterday move down, I think it is more correct, but it won't catch the down of today move? PT how would you have drawn the Fibs today?

so what setups is everyone watching for next week? also how is eur/jpy and aud/jpy with this system? Hope everyone keeps this alive. I wonder how this works with s+R lines using the forex4noobs system? my current sr lines for gbp/jpy and important longerterm sr areas are 207.00 210.55 211.98 213.55. of course the noobs system uses 4hours only, but I bet the river would work well above and below those lines. I will be pt the river this week with mini';s

Hi all, I'm not sure if this thread is totally dead... or maybe this trading method is not suitable for the current market now? Anyway, I'm introduced to this system not long ago, did some backtesting and forward test it. The results are very nice. Hence, I think we should start posting charts back on this thread and share opinions. And If PowerTrader is out there, do please guide us (:

--- 帖子 #557 ---
21 Jan 2009 GBPUSD, Lets start with yesterday trade. Note : the original template of river trade is still used, with a little color tweaking and adding of 2MA for observation purposes (: SMA 84 (Olive) LWMA 50 (Black) LWMA 5 (Orange) LWMA 20 (Light Blue) *LWMA 5 crossing LWMA 20 and LWMA 50 seem to be a confirmation of a SHORT by crossing from above, and otherwise. I took a trade yesterday at 0830 (1.3911) when a bearish candle cross LWMA 50 and went into the riverbank. Hence, didn't wait for a zone breakout. SL placed at the other end of river. Constantly moving stop loss, but taken out at 1.3753 with 158pips

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Well, I'm not really sure but from my observations, the way I see SMA 84 is as a ranging indicator. When SMA 84 is in the river, flirting in between the river, usually the market is ranging (big or small) here are some examples : 1. The first picture (9JUNE2006). Yes, there is a break out at 1430 with a long Bearish candle. But I wouldn't go into the trade as soon as it breaks(to avoid spikes). Hence, I might SHORT at 1445 opening. Putting in mind that it is a ranging day, i might put tighter SL, or maybe even exited at the touch of Fibo. 2. The second picture (9JAN2009). A big ranging day. With closer look, you might catch around 100+pips on this day although ranging. Ranging day in my very humble opinion should be look as a 'holiday' for trader (: or at least, declare it a NO GREEDY DAY. *this is from my own observations. Not sure right or wrong. Maybe you guys can share some opinions.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Now, here's a classic trade based on 'The River' by PowerTrader (you're the best!) So many good confirmations to this trade on 19Jan2009. Bearish Candle cross LWMA50 ....................... check Candle opening below Fibo level ........................ check Zone breakout .............................................. check LWMA 5 crosses LWMA 20 &amp; 50 ........................ check A SHORT trade, which then went into riverwild when exited the riverbanks. I made 400+ pips that day on my demo account. First exit when i adjusted my SL a little too tight and taken out at 1015. The second trade I just let it Flow all the way (: For those who held the position over night.... it would be a 1000 PIPS profit!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I have to admit, I'm haven't get into reversal trade based on the Fibo level. I still need more time to backtest it. If you guys look back at PowerTrader charts, his reversal trades are very good example. If any reversal expert out there could give me a little hand here (: BTW, i had the BoilingerBand indicator (Period20, Deviation3) in my charts. I know price will usually bounce back when it touches the BB(BoilingerBand). As we're trading breakouts here, I seem to take BB out of considerations when entering trades. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I've always dicipline myself no matter how tempting the trades before 0800GMT and 1800GMT, I'll not get into it. Well, that's because I'm still not that experienced yet Well, looking at GBPUSD yesterday, the market went LONG after 1800GMT. I was tempted to LONG at 2200 opening candle but I didn't eventually. Anyone could share how yesterday trade after 1800 is a good reversal trade? How to confirm the Long trade? Oh, and you guys looking at the current trade now? If i drew my zone correctly, the breakout soon of the bearish candle could be a good entry? I'm looking into Short at the opening of 1300 candle.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Not sure if it even exist, I'm looking for a way to maximize my profits. I have to say one weakness of my trades is I have difficulties catching the maximum profit for my trades. Here is an example : 14 Jan 2009 GBPUSD Took a LONG Position on 0815 opening, when the Zone Breach is confirmed by 0800candle. Price went back 59pips before going positive 80+pips. However, in this trade, I got only 30+pips, when price got my SL. Again, i am having this opinion that when SMA84 goes into the river, I should be tighter with my SL. Hmm..... Price went ranging towards the end of that day.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I was taken out yesterday with 30+ pips. Again, lesson learned... not to put SL too tight. I entered at 1300 opening. If i maintain my SL at above 61.8 FIBO, i might have managed to capture 100pips yesterday. As you can see, I"m really a noobie learning from mistakes. Question on the river, if 1130 candle a good entry? Cos, 1115 bearish candle crossed the LWMA50,passed the river but close exactly on the river(not in the riverbank). So, perhaps 1130 is an early entry for a SHORT? And... How can i spot the reversal on yesterday trade? Should i draw LRC on higher time frame? How to tell whether i should be looking for a reentry or reversal. Looking at the chart, can i assume that drawing Trendline on CCI can show the trend reversing?

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Look at today trade on GBPUSD. Even before 0800GMT (which what i discipline myself to get into trade to avoid fake breakout) But, what i notice recently the Guppy has been moving a lot. In this chart here, the time was 0500GMT and there was a 100+ pips movement. How can i make exemptions using this method for early trades? or is there other scalping method which could be used together with the river trade? Would appreciate if you pros out there leave a one liner "Don't be greedy!" Hehe, cos i'm really really a agressive noobie i think (: Can anyone share, please?

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Alright here are my thoughts of the current trade today. GBPUSD. Price broke the zone (which is rather BIG as the price is moving violently in the morning) SHORT at the break of the zone , would have around 90pips now. But I'm not that ready to take such trades as it is not yet 0800GMT. So I SHORT at break of 100.0 Fibo. Price is out of the riverbanks, so it is river wild ( I'm sorry PowerTrader if i used the term river wild wrongly, please correct me )

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Looking at the chart long enough you seem to bond into any system well. Take a look at the 15M chart. The thin black line of the river aka MID RIVER (SMA 42) seem to trying to tell us something but silently hiding away. Price WILL touch the MID RIVER each day . Even the wick of the candle touching is considered touching. (If you guys prefer the 1H chart, it will be SMA 21) So how I use this as a small filter to my trades? Let's say the price for the day is above the river and has not touch the MID RIVER. Since the probability of price touching MID RIVER is HIGH, a reversal of trend coming down is anticipated. Like wise if price has touched the MID RIVER early of the day, then the trend up or down is wise to be followed. Just something to think about !! Price The River!

Regarding the previous post, the Mid River, there is a 0.01% probability of price not coming back to meet the Mid River. But that's also good cos you know the momentum is there. The Mid River also serve as an indicator to tell us how far to put our SL.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Very interesting system. Glad you revived it.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
It's quite sad to see a great system for us to use but hidden away in the corner of this forum collecting dust. Maybe at one particular point, the price had been ranging, taking out some pips from traders, and they carried on their search for the Holy Grail. I've started a blog www.theriverfx.blogspot.com where I backtest The River system starting from 2007. I received advice to write out all the reasons for entering and exiting trades. This way, I'll be more emotionless in trading! A newbie forex trader in progress! Much more to learn from you pros out there!

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Here's another hypothesis of mine. This is for playing safe. The first chart(15M)shows a rather ranging day. Of course there are some Short opportunities during that day. The 2nd chart(1H) shows the price above the river, suggesting a Long. Since price is swimming that way, if you're forcing it to swim the other side, it won't happen(you can't change the market!) So, maybe for that day, reversal on those trades would be much easier? Interesting isn't it how different timeframes with this system tells a lot on the currency.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi, let's look at today's trade. I usually don't take trades before 0800GMT so the nice move down early in the morning I didn't take it. But, I'm starting to think it is possible to entry trades early morning if CCI TL, zone and MA 5crosses 20. Look at these past few weeks/days. Price moves a lot in the morning, unlike past results where early morning price is just plain flat. Anyway, we still have 100 pips by now! Alright, drawing a zone there, the breakout can let us enter Short. However, I entered early, with a c lassic river signal ( bearish candle forming below the river) SL at the other side of the river and we up 100 pips by now! (closed partial lot). Let's see if the flowing trade can catch more pips today (: Again, an easy profitable system if you backtest it properly. You just have to be more cautious when it comes to ranging days.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Wow, what a day, earlier I closed some lots with 100pips profit. Look at the price now. Some bullish movement start to appears. I close another lot at 1515 when break CCI TL and that's 300 pips already! What a day. I'm looking to close all trades if the MA 5crosses MA20 later.

We all know the odds of exiting at the maximum pips profits is almost impossible. Here's a discussion I'll like to make regarding zone breakout technique at take profit area: Zone breakout at 0945. You can enter immediately since a valid CCI TL is broken and MA crosses earlier. Otherwise, you wait for a candle opening outside the zone. You can use zone box for exit points too. Draw as much zone when you spot them. If the zone breakout is against your trade. You might want to exit there. Here we see a zone around 161.8 Fibo. You can exit some lot at the Fibo area. The price break at the bottom, which makes us happy (: And then a small zone is spotted but the breakout is at the upper zone. You might want to exit there. The last exit is when TL is broken + MA crosses back. You might want to go for reversal at 1745 (at the break of 100.0 Fibo). Play safe, remember? Move your SL to each Fibo level after the price has touched if you want to minimise your risk. 50 pips on reversal is a job well done for me (: Note : The zone breakout technique used on exit area was mentioned by PowerTrader but we didnt see any chart examples. I have a feeling that his method is similar like what I've discussed here, if not much better than this. He's still the best master out there (:

Just a thing to keep in mind, CCI TL ≠ Price TL. Meaning the line of the CCI TL is not an exact representation of price movement. The chart below will explain better.6Feb2007 With confirmation of zone breakout, classic river signal and CCI TL break, we enter Long here. Opps, looks like the zone is forming out here! Did I make the right choice? Should i exit now? We wait for the price to talk to us. Price opens above the zone, and we continue Long. Note: See the CCI TL break, which we take it to confirm our Long. But, it breaks back inside, instead of price going down, it went up! That's what I mean by CCI TL ≠ Price TL . You'll get what I mean after drawing tons of TL (: We can see several zone at exit area which kept breaking at the upper zone. Good for us (: You can take profit at the CCI TL break. That's around 80 pips profit.

Here's a backtest result I'll like to share : 9Feb2007 Price oh price, which way do you want to go? Above 76.4 or below 76.4? Assuming my Fibo is drawn correctly, the price seems to has no direction according to the Fibo. But, the zone breakout can tell us something! (^^) I'll wait for a candle open below the zone for confirmation, but looks like the candle open below the 100.0 Fibo. CCI TL breaks too. Perfect! 3 possible exits : 1. 127.0 where the price seems to be stuck at. 2. As soon as the upper zone breakout at the take profit area. 3. MA crosses. 1H &amp; 4H is in lower river wild, that's why it's better to go Short.

Another backtest result for fellow Forex Factorians to ponder. (I'm not a pro so you'll do the judging) 12 Feb 2007 An upper zone breakout, and I entered Long after the break of 38.2 Fibo. Yes, it went well at first, but soon the price breaks the lower zone + MA crosses. That's where to cut the losses early. WAIT Remember how the price must touch the MID RIVER each day? Well, if a Long trade is taken here, we are actually entering an extremely low probability trade here. *This is purely my own observation, I hope experts would judge and give some good comments here* When price has touched the Mid River, we then ready ourselves for any bounce back up or down trending. A classic river signal appear and I went Short. Exit when at the zone breakout and the MA crosses. CCI TL is too steep to judge.

Hi PT: I am very interested in thistrading system,but I cannot download Template and FX indicator from this addr: Template http://www.divshare.com/download/2724572-c7e FX Sniper http://www.divshare.com/download/2919082-c36 They tell me the uploader's account has reached its download limit... So ,maybe PT or someone else could send me an email, I want to learn this system carefully. MY Email:yong.luc@gmail.com Thanks.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Here you go key2008, The FX Sniper setting I'm using is 2,10,1,2. I'm not sure with others, but it is the setting I'm comfortable with. RiverTemplate is the original template from PT. rivertrade is my template. Feel free to comment key2008. I'm in a learning process here. Glad to have someone to discuss with (:

HOHO, Thanks a lot.

I've been concentrating purely on backtesting and posting personal comments on this system at my blog. I must say I'm always looking for any free time I have to look into charts. There's just so many new discoveries and things that only the chart can teach me Here's a thought of mine 14Feb 2007 We see the usual zone in the morning. Candle opening outside of the zone, we go Long. Here, we see the appearance of a doji. But, in my opinion, as we're in 15M here, candlestick pattern is less important, in my opinion. If you're a candlesticker, you want to observe it on the 1H or 4H. Just a thought for you to comment on. Several zones in the take profit area and continuous breakouts. An exit can be taken at the 127.0 Fibo area to safely bank in 37pips first.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
" If there weren't for the spikes, everyone would be rich by playing Forex!" I definitely agree with this. Backtest : 23 Feb 2007 We enter Long at zone breakout + CCI TL break. We see the price having trouble breaking the 100.0 Fibo level. Usually we put our SL at the opposite river or further at the Fibo. As we can see here, the spike took me out at -40pips. ( I once was very furious of how these spikes took me out, but then i also remembered how I didnt use any SL and I exited my trade at -100 pips.) Okay, moving on, we see a 2nd zone breakout and CCI TL confirmed it. Long here and exit when price touches 127.0 Fibo or MA crossing + CCI TL break. Around +40pips here which makes a break even day though.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Backtest : 20 Feb 2007 Price is very choppy. The 0415 price breaking the zone is not advisable to take. - Price not yet touch Mid River - 0800GMT rule At 0815, the price breaks the zone and touches Mid River. I entered Short here. SL at the opposite river? I don't think so. The range is too small (15+ pips). I prefer the SL to be above the 100.0 Fibo level. 1st exit at zone breakout. 2nd exit at MA crosses + CCI TL break. Reversal can be done at the zone breakout, in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Backtest : 26 Feb 2007 The 1st zone breakout doesn't signal me for a Short, since the CCI TL is being a very strong support. Then, the price goes ranging again. LWMA50 &amp; MA84 have a date in the Mid River towards the end of the day. I think that the CCI TL definitely helped us to filter out a lot of bad trades.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_KsOzp84BcW...320/2feb09.gif I feel this week price action is a little different than the usual, hence I'll like to give my own humble observations. 2 Feb 2009 Earlier the CCI TL breaks and the price went into a new Fibo level. But i didn't enter because I'm not that confident. Zone breakout at 0900 + CCI TL break and I short here. Breaking each Fibo and zone is a good thing for us. Exits at the CCI TL break &amp; MA crossing Here's what I observe: If we have a Tl drawn far back, yes it can indicate strong if drawn correctly. But if you've drawn a divergence..... you'll be losing trades. (although divergence in 15M may not be strong) http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KsOzp84BcW...divergence.gif You'll notice how price moves up but didn't break the TL. That's why i feel that drawing too many TL is not a crime (: Hence, caution on drawing TL at CCI, make sure the price obeys it.

Hey there, great that you are keeping this thread alive

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Been quiet for a little while because in my demo account i was forward testing and losing quite a number of trades. (As a newbie, you might have guessed I look at other system, indicators and such to get out of this losing streak. Yes I did. But I slap myself awake and back on the river!) I've been getting whipsaw and fake zone breakouts. I'm actually in the middle of tuning this system. So guys, just give me a little more time before you start commenting ya (: P.S I have a feeling it has something to do with the 4H MA5 &amp; MA20.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
4H chart. Look at the attached chart and what could you see at the highlighted areas? Do you see something in common they have? Black MA = LWMA50 Olive MA = SMA 84 These two MA has been around since PT originally introduce the system. Notice when price touches either MA, it will chase towards the other MA. Visualize the gap between the both MAs as a black hole. When price touches it, price will get sucked in and exit on the other MA. The other time frame might be not suitable to see this black hole in action. Sometimes price reverses before it goes on all the way to the other side. Note : There are some fake ones, but one similarity I see in all the fakes one are none of them touch the Mid River. Also best to wait for candle close confirmation inside the black hole . This is a very very early stage of my observation. Comment please~ (:

--- 帖子 #589 ---
RedPadisha, you must be very good in PA. Would like to hear some tip/comments from you! Advices will do great for me too! Anyway, here is an example of those fake black holes I'm talking about. Notice how the price doesn't manage to cross the river and goes back in the trend.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Well, today went well. I'm up 100+ pips now but I'm putting my Stop Loss tighter by the minute. Reason : Price hasn't touch Mid River (15M) So, let's see if price later will come back down to touch to Mid River. By the way, I'm starting to feel the FX Sniper CCI Indicator is not much of use in the 15M because there are too many divergence (fake ones since price moves too fast). I am now starting to draw CCI TL on the 4H timeframe only. Maybe with a 1H time frame CCI on the 15M will do. Anyone has such indicator? Or maybe river traders could suggest a better indicator? This is just my thought anyway.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Yip, looks like we are right about the price going down to touch the Mid River.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I've become rusty at this method and the pair, I mainly trade the Eurusd at the moment with pure PA and a few basic ma on the 5 min, I feel like I am about to ditch the ma's, but fibs are still good. My problem with this method and indeed any method these days that involves drawng a price boundary round a range and waiting for price to just break it or some pattern to form means nothing since group behaviour is so much more fickle with banks going down and the like. In my humble opinion (and I mean humble), the two most important skills to master in trading at the moment are 1&gt; Being able to judge if today is the day to trade, is the market behaving in the right way. and most importantly 2&gt; Judging if price is behaving in the the right way before you take the trade, is volume right. The last piont seems more complex and and exciting then I thought would have been the case ( well at least I think so as I am learning it ) but it seems to mean that any reliance on indicators must be scrapt. Please take these points as from a fellow learner, and if you disagree please say so and rip me apart Cheers and keep up the great work

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Right on, redpadisha! Totally agree with you especially the first point there. I sometimes dislike MA too as lower TimeFrame gives too much take cross (even higher TimeFrame too (: ) I also begin to understand that there are some trades that are not for me. By putting in mind that I must not capture every trades, I am exploring this system for ways to satisfy the first point and I think I almost get it. I think I'll post it up later for fellow factorians to comment. BTW, I PA !

--- 帖子 #594 ---
To tell you the truth, I'm terribly bad at trading this live. I'm locking myself in my room, with printed charts all over the table trying to figure out why I made loss in recent trades. I always love to read back earlier posts by PT and other people like Aidan who contributes much to this system. PT once posted " Don't forget the 4H..." Don't forget the 4H... Hmm.....

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I somehow think this post by PT is the most valuable information I neglected. Drawing as many TL and Fibo lines at the 4H is as important in 15 minutes. All these while I've only drawn on the 15M chart. I must spend extra time studying the 4H chart as well.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
GBPUSD in my opinion has a very wide range. I took Short after the break of Fibo level. To my horror, the price goes reverse back up. My SL was at the other end of the river. So I took a look at the 4H chart. Price is at the bottom river, MA is suggesting a short (btw, personally, i seldom look at MA). So what went wrong? In my observations, and as PT mentioned, trend line, fibo and zone breakout are all needed to see price action. So, at the 4H chart, you can see the bottom TL giving a good support to the price, and 100.0 Fibo is also doing the same.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
LSs.. May i know what setting MA's for navy and orange colour..?

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Orange = LWMA5 Navy = LWMA 20 Please note that the MA is not from the original River, I'm still experimenting with the MA. BTW, I personally not a fan of MA.

Hey PT, First of all thank you for sharing this wonderful and amazing system. I have been following the river system for a long time now, recently i have also started trading the zones you have taught us on this thread. I think using the breakout panca eagle indicator would be helpful in identifying the zones easily! if combined with the fibs. So please review it and let me know your view on it. I have attached the indicator below. Thanks a lot!! Shreyash

--- 帖子 #61 ---
PT, Just wanted to say thank you for the method. I have been reading through and demo trading with the strategy with some good results so far and can't wait to go live! I noticed that the thread has somewhat died off and wanted to inject a bit of live back in as would love to hear from people that are currently using the system. Cheers

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Does anyone still have the template, the video explaining this zone breakout and river method?
