Hey guys,

Skip the boring part below lol – This isn't a rulebook to follow exactly, so take it in, relate if you can, and if not, just hear me out.

This is my first post here, so go easy on me. I promise to add value to this site.

We’ve all been there, right? Digging through endless “holy grail” strategies, hoping something sticks. Well, after 10 years of trading, I think I finally have something worthwhile to share—something simple, effective, and easy to grasp. I’m here to give back to the community that helped me get here.

Introducing the Nova Trading System, my go-to method that’s been quietly working wonders for me. Whether you’re new or seasoned, I believe you’ll find this system refreshingly simple and powerful. No fluff—just practical, actionable stuff.

Forget all the jargon: ICT, bearish/bullish breaker blocks, fair value gaps, order blocks, liquidity, etc. If you just trade the signals as they come, you’ll be fine. But let's keep it clean and easy.

What’s the Nova System All About?

The name's pretty straightforward. Future versions might even be called Super Nova, but let’s see how this goes first.

At its core, the Nova System revolves around precise entry and exit rules using volume strength, market structure, and clean signals. I’ve combined the best parts of different strategies into something that consistently works for me.

It’s adaptable—perfect for any market condition—and it fits my trading style.

But most importantly, you’ve got to make it work for YOU and your trading personality. If you're into volume and market structure, this could be the breakthrough you’re looking for.

Now, let’s talk about my journey: I struggled with the psychological side of trading for years, no matter what system I used. I found myself too emotionally attached to my trades in the early days, which held me back.

It’s taken me about 7 years to get my mindset straight, and I’m finally at a place where I feel 100% confident. So, I’m sharing this system for you guys to critique and improve on.

Currently, the system is available as an indicator on TradingView (still working on MT4, but it's a headache).

My Approach:

The key is clean charts, following the trend, and minimal indicators—maybe just one if you really need it. I’m going to break down the Buy and Sell Entry models for you.

If this sounds good so far, feel free to stick around. I’ll post live examples and setups soon. Let me know if you’re interested—I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.

Indicator link is here:
Nova Volume Indicator - TradingView

RULES:

I won’t tolerate rudeness or negativity. This is a positive space to learn and share. If anything offends you, I’ll ban you—simple as that. We’re all adults, so let’s act like it.

This system works best if you have at least 2 years of chart experience. If you’re not into it, that’s fine—move along. But if you’re looking for a fresh perspective and willing to put in the work, stick with me.

Also, I won’t be sharing the source code of the indicator. It’s taken me 10 years to find something that works for me, and I’ve seen people take advantage of others’ work. But I’m happy to share the indicator so you can use it—no problem.

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

Post 2: Indicator and Entry Models

So, here’s the TradingView indicator:

Nova Volume Indicator - TradingView

Add the 50, 100, and 200 EMA to your charts first.

The Buy Entry ModelVolume Kick-Off: Start by confirming volume with the Nova Volume Indicator. When you see a strong green bar cross above the 0 line, that’s momentum pushing in the buying direction. But don’t jump in yet—this is just your green light. Check EMA Angle: Now, check the trend with the EMA angle. If the EMA is sloping upward, you're in trend direction. If you're new, look for a slight upward tilt. Entry: Once the volume confirms with 1-2 green histogram bars and the EMA angle is confirmed, enter at the close of the candle (usually the second histogram bar). Simple. Set your stop just below the recent swing low, and aim for a 1:2 risk-to-reward. This isn’t about gambling; it’s about playing the odds. The Sell Entry ModelVolume Confirmation (Bearish): Look for a red bar crossing below 0 on the Nova Volume Indicator—this signals selling pressure. EMA Slope Down: If the EMA is sloping downward, we’re in a downtrend, and the sell signal is valid. Entry: Enter at the close of the candle after volume confirmation. Place your stop above the recent swing high, aiming again for 1:2 risk-to-reward. Let it breathe and ride the momentum. When the background is BLACK (dark mode) or WHITE (light mode), don’t trade. Wait for it to turn green (bullish) or red (bearish). With experience, you can take the first color change, but it’s subjective based on your style and experience.

The signal line will help keep you on the right side of the market, and you can use a multi-timeframe (MTF) approach: Check the 1-hour signal and drop down to a lower timeframe for entries, targeting that 1:2 profit.

Next post will feature annotated examples from GOLD today—it’s been a great day.

Let me know if this seems like a waste of time, otherwise I’ll keep sharing.

So basically the indicator I have created is on tradingview which i'll post the link below:

https://www.tradingview.com/script/v...y-SplitzMagic/

Add the 50, 100 and 200 EMA to your charts first

The Buy Entry ModelVolume Kick-off: First, we look for volume confirmation using the Nova Volume Indicator. When we see a strong green bar cross above the 0 line, we know momentum is pushing in the buying direction. But we don’t jump in just yet—this is just the green light.

Check EMA Angle: Next, we confirm the trend direction using the EMA angle. If the EMA is pointing upward at a clear slope, we’re aligned with the trend. You’ll get a feel for this with experience, but if you’re starting out, a slight upward tilt in the EMA is what you’re looking for.

Entry: Once the Nova Volume Indicator gives the go-ahead with 1 or 2 green histogram bars and the EMA angle is confirmed, we enter at the close of the candle with the volume signal (usually 2nd histo bar). Simple, right? Set your stop just below the recent swing low and aim for a 1:2 risk-to-reward. We’re here to stay in the game, not to gamble. The Sell Entry Model is opposite but yeah...Volume Confirmation (Bearish): Look for a red bar in the Nova volume indicator crossing below 0. This signals strong selling pressure in play. Just like with the buy model, we wait for confirmation.

EMA Slope Down: The trend is our friend here too. If the EMA is sloping downward, it means we’re in a downtrend and the sell signal is worth considering.

Entry: Enter at the close of the signal candle after the volume confirmation. Place your stop above the recent swing high, and once again, aim for a 1:2 R. Let the trade breathe and ride the momentum.
When the histogram has a BLACK (dark mode) or WHITE (Light Mode) background it means there is NO TRADE. Wait for it to change to GREEN (Bullish) or Red (Bearish) and watch the volume bars.

With experience you can take the first colour change but it's all subjective and based on your trading style and experience.

The signal line will help keep you on the right side of the market if you are not sure and you can also combine MTF approach.

I.e use the 1HR signal and move down to a lower TF for entries targeting the 1HR 1:2 profit (if that makes sense)

The next post will be annotated examples from GOLD today which has been amazing.

If this sounds a waste of time let me know : )

Here is my chart template on TV:

If you were patient then I could which ive just posted mate

--- 帖子 #5 ---
With my indicator you can see when the volume is coming into the market. If we are in an uptrend and there is a pullback then the histogram will turn BLACK for the background until a new opportunity is present.

Nice indicator. Good work, manually back testing now.

Thats what I was hoping will happen... let you guys run off and see how it can be better lol

You'll have a blast with it btw... works on any timeframe

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Here are the settings and how they work:

The Nova Volume Indicator offers several input settings to help you tailor the indicator to your unique trading style:

Signal Period: Adjust the period for calculating the signal line (EMA of momentum score). A shorter period reacts quickly, while a longer one smooths the signals.

Volatility Period: Control the lookback period for assessing market volatility. Shorter periods capture recent fluctuations, and longer periods provide a broader view of price behavior.

Price Filter MA Length: Set the period for the moving average used to filter trades based on price action, helping determine the trend direction.

Alert Threshold: Define the level at which the indicator signals potential buying or selling opportunities. Customize this setting to suit your trading preferences.

Then after just change the colours as you wish...

If you want to see bearish entries then that will be in the next few posts

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I don't see the histogram turning black until a new opportunity

--- 帖子 #11 ---
The beauty of this indicator is that you don't need to rely on it solely, it can be a confluence but it's a pretty fecking good one i'll tell you.

Let it guide you but still... use the system you use currently and see if it can replace it.

For me, I believe volume and market structure are the 2 main things to follow and I get that volume is subjective to the broker but for me it's been working for ages and I've got to the bored stage now where I just profit and it doesn't mean anything anymore.

So with this system... just play around with it and let it suit your style but it will give you confidence if you backtest and forward test it to just hold trades and let them play out.

Will post examples from EURUSD today next

Bearish entries on GOLD - 12 R @ 1:2 = 24 % if based on 1% per trade.

2 Losses so take off 2% which is 22%

--- 帖子 #25 ---
If going for 1:1.5 then the results will be even better but for me personally I focus on 1:2 as its easier and also its subjective. I would never let a trade almost hit TP and then hit the SL.

It's always best to break even at 1:1 but results will vary if you do so.

Eitherway, I hope this helps and I'll be back tomorrow if any questions.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi, looks interesting and I will have a play on TV and let you know.

Are the default settings what you are using on M1 charts?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Yes default settings for every timeframe, however its up to you what you change them to suit your style.

Those are just what I use personally

MT4/5 indi will be posted soon

--- 帖子 #28 ---
The beauty of the indicator is that you only need to use common sense if you understand market structure. It will save you during ranging markets BUT you need to understand the structure of the market.

I cant force feed chart knowledge so you need to at least learn about how the market moves and the different phases to understand why this works.

It is profitable if used blindly but if you have more experience then you'll know which entries are valid and it will change your life. It's changed mine eitherway hence why I'm sharing.

Nobody ever shares knowledge without it working for them first but I know how people can be on this site so I'm only posting to help those actually willing to learn and understand.

If someone can test 100 times that will be great for youtube haha

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Interested, will wait for the MT4 indicator to test

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi! I have been trading for a year now and still consider myself a beginner. I am lucky that I get to be here early. I will wait for the MT4/5 then test it on demo. Thank you for all your effort on sharing your knowledge to us.

No carry on, very interested

the emas doesnot come with the indicator? what emas are you using?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
keep it going,this is intresting ,though i'm more used to mt4/mt5 platform. will keep following to know more. Thanks

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hello and thanks for the sharing. Several questions please:

There are 3 EMAs, which one slope is a signal?

You (or the Author of Nova system) use classic 3 EMA method for HTF trend confirmation - it's lagging as all MAs but it's ok and usable. The question is:

If you say (and I hope that)

then it can be EA-converted and tested automatically. But there is no MT4/5-version and TV-version was publshed 16 hours ago only. I want to kindly ask how long have you back tested it? And, the general question, how long have you forward tested it?

Thank you once again for all your work!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi, have had some good results but thought I would ask about this.

NZDUSD M15 chart.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The lower oscillator gave me a timely signal (vertical dotted red line) for this 46 pip move up. The nova didnt give a signal at all.

It was a high volitality move...and early obdservations show the nova works better on slower moves.

This isnt a crirism but just some early feedback.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Right, good morning/afternoon/evening all

I am going to add further insights based on the questions asked as I didn't actually mention them. I was pretty tired last night so apologies.

Will also then edit first few posts so things are clearer.

Bare with me

--- 帖子 #37 ---
The Nove Volume Trading System claims to help traders capitalize on market volume trends, focusing on volume spikes and dips to predict price movements. It’s intriguing for those looking to refine entry and exit points, but is it truly effective? Has anyone here tried it, and if so, what were the results?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
There is only 2 pages 2 read...Have a look

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Right let me explain the EMA's (will update the first few posts after)

In the settings of the indicator you can choose which ema you wish to use my default is the 200 for filtering out the trading signals which can be changed here:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I use the 50, 100 and 200 EMA - These are personal to me and I mainly focus on the 200 for trend direction. The 50 & 100 Emas for me are areas where I may place a stop loss if I am unsure about the stop loss and we are close to or inside the EMA's.

You'll find that like the trendlines you trade away from them which is the same with the EMA's unless there of course is a trend change where you will find the downtrend truly begin once price breaks out on the other side of the ema trend causing them to flip as seen below:

Thanks for pointing this out Axecap.

Personally, I don't tend to focus on 15m and higher for entries as I am more of an in and out kind of person. I love to get my risk off the table as soon as possible so I do find myself using the 1m and 5m charts.

However where the volume starts coming into the market where the background was white (black for dark mode users) then you could dial into the lower timeframe (1m/5m) and look for earlier entries.

I don't think I fully addressed the multi timeframe approach to the system but that is what I would do. If you trade the higher timeframe direction then dial down and start looking for entries.

For this system I have found the best results when there is a recent swing (high or low) and I will primarily focus on trading with the trend.

Once you start focussing on volume then you will begin to start feeling out your own intuition to enter trades that are not actually part of the system hence why I would like people to use it alongside their own current systems and get a better feel for what it is telling you... use it as a confluence to begin with and not a strategy.

Hope this helps & makes sense bud

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I posted the indicator yesterday on TV to share it here whilst I have the MT4/5 indicator coded and tested which I will share here as soon as it's ready.

The 3 EMA's are my personal choice but my previous posts explain how I use them if you have a look.

Default EMA is the 200 which is what the indicator will use to filter the trades but you can use any EMA you wish.

If you follow the entry rules you can backtest it, I use the replay feature on tradingview to test other instruments with it and it works well on the 1/5m chart which are my primary entry timeframes.

Its based on volume and so as soon as you see a sudden increase in volume you can know that the move is going to be in your favour most times.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thanks for that.....confluence is my thing....which is why i always look at new methods to see what i can add to my

bag of tricks and what I can replace.

I have noticed good entries from 5 and 2 minute charts

--- 帖子 #43 ---
This is what I was doing for so long but for me I was getting frustrated with all these different indicators and systems as I found I tried to merge them together and just ended up with analysis paralysis.

In the end I sat down and thought, when will I know the move is actually here? - hmm it has to be with volume so I set out to only focus on volume. However I needed a bit more than just that so I added the signal line so I know when things will work out better for me.

What I would say is just look at past and current moves and just watch the indicator and see what information its giving you. On the 1 min chart it's so accurate that I have zero emotion and when I lose I know there will be a series of wins around the corner.

My aha moment was when I realised it will keep me out of ranging markets and that was where I lost most of the time.

So using the EMA, try to focus on being on the correct side of it when taking entries... I don't tend to counter trend trade as I get burnt.

If you do see volume increasing but the indicator background is white or black then you can sometimes enter in those areas but as mentioned before I like a swing to protect my entries.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I will be back later with some trading examples from today. Always best to analyse the most recent trades

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Very interesting, looking forward to the MT4 version.

Regards, Baz

--- 帖子 #46 ---
These are the most recent trades on the 1M chart for gold. You can go back and look yourselves for clarity.

You'll also see that some entries I will not use the full swing low and instead the top of the large impulse candles.

I usually like to see big volume and 1 red/green bar on histogram or 2 good volume histogram candles in a row in the direction of the trend when I am entering a position. With 1m charts you have to be quick and you can often get 1:2 but 1:1.5 will yield better results.

I am presenting my approach more mechanical but when I am trading I will do on the fly changes depending on the situation. W

With experience you will have that intuition of when to enter or when to break even etc...

This is just to aid you.

For some, on this chart you may not take the full profit each time but you can't deny that it picks out good signals

Live Entry

When I see a Squeeze (Green Candles), I look for the obvious fake out, an area in the market that captured trapped traders. In this case it was bears that were trapped to the downside. I then use NOVA to time my entry with a bullish bias, and in this example I'm ignoring the background/ema bias because I already found it.

The other candle colors represent expansion and contractions. Basically, we want the Candles to remain a light color (light blue for buys).

All in one squeeze indicator with candle colors.

@xkwisit2001

We know there is no real volume in FX.

So, is your indicator going to use just tick broker's volume for FX?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Good point—there’s no centralised volume in FX, so of course we are working with tick volume, which reflects price movement frequency.

While it’s not the full picture, I’ve found it reliable for gauging momentum shifts, especially with broker-specific data.

The Indicator does use tick volume, yes, but it’s not just any volume reading. It's set up to identify momentum patterns with higher accuracy by filtering out noise and focusing on volume changes that align with trend strength.

Results have been solid so far, and I think you’d be surprised at how well this approach holds up even with FX tick volume.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hello there, sorry I'm new to tradingview, may I know why the indicator is not showing? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Ok

Then can you please explain the squeeze idea realized in this candle marking indicator?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Sure. RickM talks about this a lot and in recent testing I found it particularly powerful. In essence we want to find two things before we enter the market with whatever signal you use...in this case it's NOVA.

First we want to see a Squeeze as RickM wrote -

"Using a Bollinger Band, I am searching for Squeezes when these Bollinger Bands move inside a Keltner Channel Bands (set to 1.5). Now I am looking to enter a trade before breakout once it crosses the 21 EMA if it continues current BIAS. So in a Major Bearish Trend, I want to enter within LOW VOLATILITY area inside a SQUEEZE before "The Firm" enter the market and attack high Bid/Ask imbalance."

He explains that all trends start from squeeze.

The second thing we want to look for is an area where the market makers can take advantage of traders. The easiest way to find this is to look for a fake out in one direction. Usually a sudden push to one direction, sweeping liquidity and trapping traders before price pushes to the opposite side.

From my experience the Squeeze will come after the trap but still looking into this.

Once yoy identify the Squeeze and the Trap, yoy have your bias set and all you need now is a timely signal to enter the market. That's where we use the entry method that the OP mentioned.

So the way the indicator is posted works is it's identifying the squeeze for us...by printing green candles. Then colonizing the Candles based on expansion. The lighter the color the more likely for the trend to continue expanding in current direction.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Since FX volume is broker specific, have you done any reasearch as to which brokers data contains the highest volume? Whose feed are you using to get your results results.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #65 ---
My broker is IC Markets which is ranked largest broker for volume so I suppose it helps to use them if using it but I have used this with other brokers and still had similar results.

I appreciate you pointing out the volume being by broker as new people may not get that. However, with anything it's always best to test things first before making decisions.

This has been working for me so I'm only presenting what I have found... but yes, its tick volume.

Yet to try it on futures though.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thank you for the details

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I, and I assume others, use TV for analysis and then open trades on other platforms, for different reasons.

Those not familiar with TV may not know that you can select a chart on Trading View from different brokers so that was the reason for my quiestion. IC markets supplies a feed for spot gold (and the other majors) for example, so if one selects their chart/feed and then  adds the Nova that would seem to be the best option to achieve comparable results to yourself.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
That's a great suggestion Axecap I do mainly use TV for my analysis and entries which are on a separate screen with MT4, with a little search we can find the brokers with the highest volume. IC Markets is one of them and then it can help with getting the best data.

I didn't know IC markets had the most volume so I've been lucky but I've never had issues with the indicator

--- 帖子 #69 ---
From my previous posts about the ema, you can choose which EMA to follow to suit your own system. This indicator should and always will be for confluence even though it yields good results on its own but experience is necessary to know when an entry will work or not.

You don't have to wait for the background to change colour with experience but for those who are new it is best to stick to that rule to at least gain consistency in your entries and not stress. Over time thing will get easier which is what happened for me.

Losses or cutting early were an issue for me before but this has helped eliminate that which allows for better learning, intuition and results.

When choosing a strategy or system you need to be comfortable with losses and know that bigger wins are right around the corner.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
According to wiki Fx the top 3 by volume are.

IC markets - USD$29 billion

Saxo - USD$20.1 billion
Forex.com - USD$18.6 billion

IG and Pepperstone are around 8 billion each

Average daily Volume

Not sure how much difference it makes which one you use , but maybe getting as much as you can is best.

Anyway I will carry on using IC as I test the Nova.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I didnt take any of these trades but on GBPJPY alone there were many winners in the past 5 hours alone on the 1m chart.

Yes there will be losses which is normal but generally following the volume will have you a winner.

Best thing to do is test for yourself and see

This is the best thing, it works for me but may not work for others when it comes to broker etc... I've never had an issue personally.

Would be interesting to see how this works with futures where its centralised

EDIT: here are some gold futures examples

As ive said, entries can be subjective to the person trading which what makes a trader unique. This system isnt promising riches out of the gate but it is a very good confluence.

YOU NEED TO KNOW MARKET STRUCTURE 100%

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Are indicies also centralised? S & P 500 etc?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
ok no they are not, no volume available

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I believe they are but personally I mainly trade gold which is my baby lol

When it comes to indices with forex brokers I dont think they are centralised

I think the key is to find a broker that has the most volume... lucky for me IC markets is so ive been okay

--- 帖子 #76 ---
For me the goal was to win more than I lose which sounds cliche but eitherway, any volume is good volume compared to focussing on price alone.

So many times I would lose to manipulation or pullbacks not knowing when is best to enter.

Think of it like 10 kids on a massive swimming pool slide, they all line up and go down (impulse move)... its okay to slide down if they are all half way down as the momentum is there but after they all get to the end they have to walk back up (pullback) lol

As long as you can get the 1:2 or 1:5 you're golden. No point trying to hit home runs.

Home runs can come from getting involved in a higher timeframe move on the 1m or 5m chart.

I will break down trading when its really choppy. I just wanted to help get people familiar with the entries.

During choppiness you will find you will take some losses but also some winners which cancel you out. But following market structure it will help when there is a true breakout of the range. Will get onto this shortly.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Are these 3 EMAs 50, 100, 200?

Correct, these are the ones I use. But the indicator is set to use the 200 ema to filter signals.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
There are 2 losses there in a row which is normal but your initial entries would have been beforehand which is why I have said it can be subjective based on experience.

You really need to know market structure to know when to enter and then intuition which takes chart experience to get.

Also when you see there is a black/white background with strong volume and then it turns green background that is also indication to enter.

Imagine this on a prop account

Glad you're picking it up - you dont even have to enter every single entry. Spoilt for choice on that trend.

What it's helped me do is take every win and every loss without stress even if you think the trend is moving to far down.

Once losses start to arrive it usually means the trend is changing and most times I will try and get a break even if we hit 1:1

You can see from here that you stay out of the market when the background is black (dark mode) or white (light mode)

Same will be for choppy markets but I will get onto that later

For now, check it out on tradingview and get familiar with it

I also do use davit's weekly pivots (indicator attached)

This help with long term targets if you wanted to hold trades. As you can see we just hit the weekly pivot level (yellow lines) so in reality you can use this indicator to help get into trends towards the next pivot levels.

Trading choppy conditions:

So I am just going to explain trading during choppy conditions with the indicator.

If price has expanded alot like today with gold you'd have seen we hit 13 1:2 trades in a row before the first loss occurred.

For me, when a loss happens during a downtrend/uptrend it will then make me start focussing on what is happening i.e market structure or key levels.

If I then see a the market seems to be reversing (breaking previous high or lows) I will then start watching what happens without entering.

The indicator will also show you this with a black/white background to sell you not to trade yet.

I will only start to enter any trades when I see the recent low broken in a downtrend or recent high in an uptrend.

In the image below I have marked out the non trade areas and I have also marked out the high and low that needs to be broken to continue.

Rule of thumb, if the 50/100/200 EMA are still above price in a downtrend then I will be cautious.

It makes sense to only take SELL trades that are below the 200EMA and BUY trades when above but with more experience with market structure you will learn to be able to enter earlier... but for beginners I wouldn't advise this till you have enough experience with the structure i.e High highs higher lows, lower highs lower lows.

The indicator is great to help you stay out of the choppy areas by keeping the backgrounds neutral till its time to enter but again.. market structure.

As you can see below, where I marked the red circle on the chart you can see price couldnt break the low so I instead would start buying even though we are below the 200EMA.

The first loss was in the downtrend and then the 2nd was when it was looking like it was reversing... after those 2 losses and being able to work out the high and low that needs to be broken is when you can start entering again.

Also note the background being black most of the pullback which is what will help keep you out.

Once the uptrend is confirmed with a break of the 200EMA with force you can then start following hopefully what will be a new uptrend but just be sure to check higher timeframe trends as it could still be a pullback on the higher TF.

The blue areas marked are the non trade areas.

You can then see once the low couldnt break there were 3 wins in a row.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
One more thing, it doesn't make sense to enter a BUY or SELL without being protected by a low (personal opinion) so don't enter any signals that appear at the high to buy or at the low to sell. Hope that makes sense.

I also appreciate all the messages being sent to me regarding this. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #102 ---

Check this indicator out, its tradingviews most trending indicator atm. Buy entries when Candles are dark deep red. This signals that price is currently extremely deviated.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I like this, will check it out!

Be sure to keep us updated with your findings. As I said before, this indicator is better off as a confluence for your own systems to give confidence in entries.

Just to add, I would make sure market structure is followed before entering unless experienced.

Also, try looking at RSI candles where you can set candles to change colour when overbought or oversold - I used to use them

Thanks MachineLearn

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Following on from what MachineLearn said, if you want to use the indicator he suggested its up to you. Anything that helps will work.

Just don't use too many indicators that confuse you as I am ANTI indicator unless it adds value and keeps charts clean.

For me, Volume & Price is what matters in my system. Moving averages just help to be on the right side of the market.

Again, if entering any positions consider breaking even when at 1:1 so you can keep yourself from too many losses.

For me, losses indicate trend change with this indicator so I dont mind losses especially if I win 13 in a row and take 2 losses... minimal impact.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I'll be forward testing of course. Agreed, market structure should be considered. Since the ema ribbon is integral to the system and identifying market structure maybe you can add it to the Nova indicator as an option.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Check out RSI candles (by glaz)

You can set the overbought and oversold and see if they work well for you too. They defo work for pullbacks

My RSI is set to 65 - 35

If you set to 50 - 50 then you see just 2 colours

Like below 65-35

Very familiar with this indicator ive used it a bunch in prior systems.  It's great

--- 帖子 #109 ---
It definitely helps once you know what RSI settings you want to use. For 1M i usually use 7.

But the one you provided looks good as you can choose to enter counter trend on the lighter colour changes. I wouldn't enter on the deep red as it can be deep red the whole downtrend.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
So for an MTF approach

If you were monitoring the 15M trend and price broke down below the 200EMA you could set a 1:2 trade on the 15m and follow it on the 1m chart.

Example of 15M entry below:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Once you identify the 15M downtrend you can move down to the 1M chart and look for entries like todays (below)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The same will work if you use the 1HR or higher to identify a new trend. Red line is the entry on the 15M.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
It's less likely to keep running then the extreme levels of something like the rsi, if you use NOVA for entries and structure deep red gives excellent entries. Atleast on h4

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I'm just glad it's helping you. Probably more advanced for beginners, for me my strategy works for me and me only. But I want this to just aid people instead of sticking to rigid rules that work for some and not others.

Could you please post 6 or so months history or a trade explorer to view it's consistency over time? I've seen a few traders who use moving averages and what not but personally I don't really understand how they indicate too much.

I like drawing horizontal lines to plot important price points but never felt the need for indicators or tools. Just want to grasp an understanding, apologies if I'm asking for too much!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Just to clarify to other traders. I use them for mean reversion. Meaning if we're in a downtrend I'm looking for deep blue candles signaling a small pullback so we can use NOVA to enter short. This is a bit riskier and maybe a tad harder.

There's many way to apply the candle colors however!

--- 帖子 #133 ---
For those who like to trade 1 or 2 trades per day this is what I would call A+ setups.

They occur often and will usually be the start of a trend.

Bearish: When you see the moving averages squeeze close and start to slope down you will want price to break the 200EMA with good volume which could be the first entry. The moving averages will then start to flip. Then you can follow up with continuation entries to SELL using Nova.

Bullish is opposite: When you see the moving averages squeeze close and start to slope up you will want price to break the 200EMA with good volume which could be the first entry. The moving averages will then start to flip. Then you can follow up with continuation entries to BUY using Nova.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Quite often there will only be a certain amount of impulse moves during the trend till it starts to die off to continue or reverse.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
If entering on the big impulse moves down you can find yourself safe even though the stop loss will be bigger but I use a trade calculator to sort out my lot sizes.

But even after the consolidation on the current trade we are still win.

I mainly trade the US session crossover even though I am based in the UK.

Prefer when the market starts to really move but with the news today I stayed out and plus being friday - don't like how unpredictable it is.

I do also follow AMDX/XAMD for the phases so I pretty much just avoid friday.

Will sometimes trade london session but with having kids and the morning being a bit hectic I find myself on the chart after 12pm.

All these entries I am showing as examples of what I would enter, I don't take them all but you can see there's plenty entries to go around.

Have a few people trading prop accounts doing well just taking 1 or 2 trades.

Another just hit as I've been typing this.

If you check the histo the first one with an X wasnt an entry because the signal line was above zero (for anyone else reading)

Done. Entry from NOVA wasn't strong but still valid. Personally observing the difference between strong bar entries and weak bar entries.

Also observing which time frame is best for me with this system. Works great with indices and gold on M1. For standard forex pairs I like M15 and H1.

Side note: larger market structure is always taken into consideration when I enter trades. I'm always trying to move with the larger picture. I just zoom in on trade because of mobile.

How does the indicator behave on a higher time frame's compared to a lower one's?

@XKVISIT. We are some guys talking about your Nova indicator. When it is based on tics per time unit - how can the values be negative in some periodes.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi vmd and nice to see you here.

It works on any timeframe although for me I use MTF analysis in alot of my decisions.

The way I look at it is let's say on the daily there are 1 or 2 bullish bars in the histogram, the signal line is above or curving up to cross 0 level and price is above the moving averages that would be a signal for me to dial down to a lower time frame (You can mark a horizontal line where where the signal occurred).

I will then start looking for setups on the lower timeframes in the direction of that daily signal if that makes sense.

When entering, I use the 1st bar sometimes but usually I enter on the close of the 2nd bar (3rd bar entry). I don't do this blindly and I check market structure to see where I am.

Sometimes when there is a buy signal on a higher timeframe, price will dip/pullback on the lower timeframe so you have to be mindful of this. I try not to enter at the top as I always want there to be a recent high or low behind me whenever I enter just so I can limit my risk and have a hard stop loss.

Currently out but my next series of posts later or tomorrow will show more examples of higher timeframe entries.

But simply, you can still use just the daily to enter a position as long as you have a recent low but I don't like waiting days or weeks for a 1:2

Would rather dial down to a lower tf entry and get a 1:20 in the same period of time I takes for daily to hit.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Absolutely smashing it mate, you picked it up so fast!

Great work and thanks for explaining things to people too.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi RiskFighter, great to see you here!

Negative values come from how many opposite tics there are present in a single bar which translates on the histo.

You'll notice that if you go on the daily you have to adjust the look of the indicator because of how much more data is in those bars.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Daily is VERY good.

Very good chance there's always some meat to eat off the bone when you get a signal.

For Regression Model.. I think - on daily specifically - going for 1:2 and using institutional levels like swing highs and lows leaves us vulnerable and predictable. Even on these small pullback there's plenty of pips to capitalize on while keeping the SL super tight and TP less predictable. Maybe a fixed TP after some research could be the move on the larger time frames.

Gray line represents a filtered trade

-Price Diversion.

-AND VOLUME DIVERSION Ideally with a color bar.

Entries: HA close above or below Jurik MA.

Trailing is  the same BUT only if there is a price diversion,otherwise I only move my Stop to BE, and let it run till next cross with diversion.

Of course, I am sure everyone is aware that Back-testing and real life are 2 different cookies.

To me Back-testing is the best way of learning, and improving.

Then on real trades, it is time to make sure rules are followed, and if the results are way off, analyze where is the "diversion" between the Back test and real life trading.

A famous trader once said:"Trading is the hardest way of making easy money".

With that, you all have a great Sunday.

I appreciate that and I'm happy it's working for you!

As I said from the start I don't mind if people use nova to develop their own system as it's a confluence not a full strategy. I just shared what I do but it's okay to share what you do, but just ensure your system uses nova which it does.

My message wasn't purely to you but more of a pre emptive thing as most systems on here end up with everyone spamming their own stuff.

As long as you use nova here and show what you're doing with it then no issues

Nova MTF approach

Morning guys! Here is how I approach the system using higher timeframes.

You can see the most recent daily gave us a signal for entry (XAUUSD) so what I usually do is apply a 1:2 (below) and dial down to the 1/5m chart

D1 Signal:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

5M chart:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You can now see that here on the 5m chart there would have been many opportunities to enter knowing where you are and where nova should take you which of course in the end hit TP.

This eliminates needing a daily bias as with almost all nova signals you will end up in profit even if at a 1:1 so it works very well if trading with the high timeframes as a confluence.

For me, I don't take any trades using HTF for a 1:2 as it takes too long to hit TP and I would prefer to use a lower timeframe to target the Daily 1:2 to capture a much bigger R:R.

You will also notice there is minimal drawdown when using nova entry signals and when 1:2 is hit there is usually a bigger pullback

--- 帖子 #181 ---

Hi I changed the EMAs to "colored emas". So You can check the slope, and if the 50 EMA changes color, then you know things are getting messy.

I hope it is useful. All the best

8 trades, M2 EURUSD today, pretty much following the rules:

7 loosers.

Granted, one took my BE stop and then ran to my original 2R TP.

By no means I am giving up, just need to fine-tune somehow.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Was on a good run 3 win, 1 loss, 1 B/E. Im guess elections got some effect on ny session. Will see. Love the mix of candles and nova so far

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hope you guys are being careful in the markets... It's election day.

I've not been trading and won't be until later this week or even next as it's gambling at this point.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Stopped out again on half an R loss, only to see it run to my TP.

Interestingly enough, right after my stop, there was another long signal.Both would have reached the sky.

I think even being election day, it is tradable, any day, sure except 10 minutes before big news. My problem has been my "perfect trailing system"

I will Back test a week or so, no trailing, either STOP or TP.

Then maybe add something like when it is very close to TP trail on 1 bar.

Will let u guys know.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Try doing exactly what I've shown first if you want to see more consistency.

1M chart on gold and follow with a higher tf 5, 15,1hr direction in mind.

You need to know where you are in the trend too so once you're at the start of a new 1m trend then see where it is on the higher timeframe as theres only so many waves that occur before things can change.

I will go over what I would have done today. As of right now I've not been taking any trades personally.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Everything is in a holding pattern for obvious reasons, limited range with smaller ranges at lower time frames. So  agree very limited number of waves on a 1 minute  chart and the higher TF will show not to enter. I've had some success with JPY pairs over the last few hours but with very few pips at a time and generally risky.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
This is the price action we are dealing with and for me, I just stay out.

Literally zero reason to trade this rubbish and I would have been out after the first few losses IF i was trading today.

Best to wait for elections to pass and allow the market to move much better, it's literally gambling at this point but hey... elections only come around every 4 years so there is no reason to enter this moshpit.

Granted, there are some good trades in there but just not worth it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In other news, Nova seems to be growing well on TV. I hope it is helping you with your trading going forwards!

This is what I am usually looking for when it comes to my best setups.

It works best when there is also a signal on the 5m/15m so you know you are in line with the trend but you still want to make sure you check the H1,H4 & Daily for the long term direction as this is where the monster trends will come from.

But 5m & 15M for structure.

I will always look at the signal line to be below 0 but not always (yellow line on nova for my chart)

You'll get better over time at knowing when it's time to go but for now ensure signal line is below 0 for sell entries and above 0 for buy entries.

This is why I use the EMAS as my short term direction on M1 unless I am in with the main trend.

Is the MT4 version out?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
You can check yourself. But I am just as eager as you to get the MT4 version. I just don't like TV. And I can't wait to get some good old MT4 alarms, so that we don't need to watch constantly.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
But TV has much better alarms, amongst other things.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
It's not about what is better, it's about what someone prefers; i also prefer MT4, could just be personal taste or what you're used to

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I look in TV and than enter in my MT5 on the phone =)))

Couple trades

1. USD/JPY - uptrend + level - consilidation (was pretty bad chop) - at the end closed manually, TP1 2:1 was hit pretty fast. closed almost 4:1

Done for today.

USD/CAD --> I was looking downside but when enter I saw potential to go up, plus the dollar situation and Trump win. That's where RR comes in role and don't get married to your outlook, doesn't mean you got to swing but here it was obivouse I saw it wrong. Nice 7:1 after and the loss never happend.

11 losers out of 13 trades, but just testing with micro lots, so far lost only 5 Euros.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Can you show your trades so we can check what's going wrong?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
trading is very subjective . this kind of startegy don't work well

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Keep practicing. The only way is to be successfull is to know market structure/price action and yourself (prefer micro lots over demo - helped me a bit this way). The rest will just help. All indicators are following the price. The price tend to reapeat iself, well maybe adding little spice here and there, however you will be able to identify patterns and take low risk- high reward trades. I think this is the main goal, it will keep you from over trading and also cover those loses when you wrong.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
After rereading the thread a few times - and looking at some of OP latest post - i started using the 5 and 15 minute timeframes for confluence and a bigger picture. I did some backtesting doing the last few days crazy price action and today after the election I decided to go live and test this system.

Doing backtesting, I have found that I don't have much luck doing London session - I am having mixed results - could just be coincidence or me picking a bad period to test.

But doing the first 4 hours of NY open, I have found this system to be quite accurate. But only if you combine it with bias from higher timeframes and not just trade every signal blindly.

Also - if there is a slowdown in momentum - I get out of the trade and take the profit i have made. Often this result in a little pullback - I can always re-enter on a new signal.

I also secure breakeven at 1:1 - I will rather be taken out by a breakeven than going into a loosing trade.

I did a two hour session doing the NY session today - NY session start 15:00 server time at my location.

Made 3,87% - was pretty bearish initially but after the double bottom and break of structure to the upside - a short term bullish bias came into play. Initially looked like a pullback on the 5 minutes/15 minute time frame, but now it also looks like a pullback on the 1 hour timeframe since 15 minutes has begun making higher lows and highs.

But I'm happy with 3,87% for the day - so I will secure that and come back tomorrow for a new try doing NY session.

Also i'm much more happy trading in the afternoon my time - so I can sleep longer and stay up later

I use tradingview for my setups.

I think you had a good trade on +0.5% --> Why did you close it? Or it was break even stop loss you moved. There I can see brake of that structure and retest happening. Regular stop loss wouldn't been hit and you can trail that bad boy pretty high and than give up little on trailed stop loss.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Price had done a good pump upward and then started consolidating. I much preferer price to keep going up and not just sticking to an area. Then I will secure profit and re-enter if it goes further. And yes, you will get out of some trades that continues to hit full profit. But I find that you more times will keep yourself from losing a profit or what's worse - get a losing trade. Think the most valuable lesson I have learned from losing 1000 of dollars to the marked - is that greed will kill your account - If your in doubt - pull out

Also price had reached the 100 moving average on the 1 minute - so I thought that the consolidation could be the initial bend of the short retrace and price would continue to trend bearish.

I didn't reenter right away because I was doing some other stuff - but got in later up - at that time price on the 5 minute had reached the 40 EMA on the 5 minute, and started consolidating, so I also got out there. (I use the 100, 80 and 40 ema as guidelines from a pullback strategy i used to do)

And then I waited to see what happened and when price broke structure - I entered the last trade on the bearish signal.

Whats the winrate & RR till now with LRC + Nova Indicator ?

What I have understood from your posts, when the candles are dark red and you get a green bar on nova you buy and reverse is for sell. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Yup, overall trend, the strength of the Nova bar, how many bars have been dark are some of the discretionary filters as well

I don't use or trust robots so I'm just forward testing and getting a feel of the system. I'll ultimately either fully incorporate it as my personal trading system or I'll disband it. Far from a decision so far. Testing some other confluences currently with LRC currently as well.

Today I didn't trade but if I did the strategy could have potentially gained 6 wins in a row for 12R on GOLD 1M chart following the higher timeframe pullback countertrend.

That's if you pretty much stuck to 1 trade open at a time (if possible) - it's also nice to see new contributors who are taking Nova seriously and putting it to the test!

If there are any questions let me know

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Further context for the higher timeframe pullback you can see here on the H1 that the signal line crossed the 0 level on the Nova with some strong green bars compared to the red bars before it showing bearish weakness.

Then when you go down to the lower timeframe (1M chart like on my previous post) you can then expect to see some sort of new counter trend (pullback) form which is what it did today and has stalled currently at the 50% area on my fibonacci.

My favourite area to look for the market to hit before reversing is the 66% area which is in the golden zone so there could be another push up before we head back south but we just have to play what we see... nothing is guaranteed.

On the higher timeframe, it doesn't matter if the background for Nova isn't green yet... you want to focus on the signal line and the strength of the bars.

This is pretty much the way to go. I mainly trade the US session once the extra volume enters the market.

London session expect there to be some uncertainty than US as London is usually manipulated before potential continuation or reversal. That said, it doesn't mean there aren't good setups but you have to be a bit more selective.

I will start doing more tests on different forex pairs but for me I fell in love with gold and find it hard to move onto anything else.

You also know if you're in a good trade because there is often little to no drawdown and trades should be over within around 20 minutes. If they take any longer then I will be more cautious and I almost always set to break even at 1:1.

Over time you just know which trades will hit the target and which ones seem sketchy but even the sketchy ones can still hit TP.

Regarding R:R - mine is fixed at 1:2 but I do sometimes go for a bigger return. I just like to keep everything consistent.

The most recent trade below is what I would call a sketchy trade and would probably take out at 1:1 especially after that drawdown.

So the last two days, I went back to my good old EW analysis, with HTF starting at the W chart, D, 240,H and M5.

I only trade EURUSD, and it needs a little EW update as the market progresses.

Then down to M1, filter with:

-Stop Runs.

-Divergence both in Volume and Price.

-My entry and trails is a HA close through a Jurik MA.

Both days were profitable.

The last trade I chickened out with a close to R2 profit, but if I had respected my exit rules, it would have been a 7,5 R.

Conclusion: Volume and Nova are very useful tools to add to my system.Also M1 is much better than M2, entries are tighter, and big runs still happen.So very small losses, potentially very big wins.

Happy Weekend.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Glad you found your way, next week I will show daily the entries and what R:R is possible.

I'll also be trading myself

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Next week I will be trading and showing the entries I'm taking to be transparent with you guys.

However, as I said earlier you need to know/understand market structure to trade any system... i.e this one too.

Without market structure with any system you won't succeed at all.

So my system isn't a bible or anything but if you understand the market and higher timeframe entries then this will work for you.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
The only reason why traders struggle is because of their mindset...

Greed, wanting and needing is the killer for all traders.

The moment you accept that you're rubbish and can follow something basic that resonates with you is when you will advance.

For me, I always wanted to be successful and make a lot of money and with that mindset trading will humble you to tears.

As soon as you see it as a game everything clicks and you aquire a different level of insight on the charts... it's so hard to explain but once you have enough time on the charts you start to get a feel for what is going on and then it allows you to make the right decisions for YOU.

I have the mt4 indicator almost ready but I was hoping more people would have been on board first.

On TV it works out real volume and switches to tick data if there isn't any volume data available.

MT4 doesn't allow these kind of calculations which is why there wasn't an MT4 indicator... TV Nova is a hybrid as it will show real volume with real volume markets but it wasn't working on MT4.

So for MT4 I've had to use tick data which isn't as good... however, there isn't enough people following so what is the point if nobody believes in it?

I just shared what I use personally but to do the extra work for everyone else is a lot.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I'm not and will never sell anything here... only experience but same as other old dead threads.

It's never enough.

Personally, I think tradingview is the best for analysis and indicators.

Moving them to MT4 can be a challenge due to the nature of the platforms. If I release the MT4 Nova it won't and never will be as good as the TV version.

So every trader should be using TV at least for the best results.

It works amazing on futures with real volume.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
This is what friday looks like for me on the M1 if I took every signal:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

As you can see, there were 9 wins @ 1:2 and then 7 losses the same day which means you would have 18R - 7R... still 11R overall IF you took the signals.

For me, I focus on small % gains so I'm happy with 2% per day but I am just showing what Nova can do.

If you don't believe me, backtest on tradingview and come back and let me know your results.

I'm here to help you... however the main thing needed to trade is mindset and that is the hardest part. Sticking to something you believe in which is why this isn't the holy grail. The holy grail doesn't exist... results come from the mind.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
That is the issue with sharing what works and its a noble thing to do.

However, if your strategy revolves around certain circumstances that work for you then you are doing too much trying to please everyone when they ask for MT4.

I literally split screen MT4 and Tradingview but I can't spoon feed people because they want an easy indicator.

What I am sharing pays for my children to go to private school and my lifestyle which is comfortable now.

I was never like that before though, I was broke as a joke surfing every strategy possible thinking they would work but I always knew trading was for me... I grinded it out till it worked for me and that is what I am sharing.

So I'm reluctant to share anything that deviates from my own success.

Some traders are currently using windows 7 on a rubbish laptop and are striving for success and they will achieve it but on this website it goes like this:

990 unprofitable traders out of 1000 are seeking easy everything and complain if its not comfortable for them.

Meanwhile the 10 traders that understand thrive... why is that?

I'm having to do more work from what works for me to please everyone else.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Since I started the thread I've been asked for MT4 lol

Doesn't anyone see what is being shared as great information?

I only use MT4 for entry, it's time others do the same if they want the same results instead of asking for what they think is comfortable.

Split screen TV with MT4 and enter when there is a signal if you want to follow... it's that easy.

I only shared this because I've finally reached my own goals and want to others to know how I did it as I used to be a strategy seeker without results.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Actual trading is literally 20% skill.

The issue is mindset/mentality. Entering positions and closing early only to see it would have hit TP (that was my issue). Or not knowing when to break even and get out.

At this point now I fund a small account and ask my daughter whether I should buy or sell for her spending money lol.

Take a trade on the 4HR and see what happens... honestly once you see trading as a game it's so easy.

If you're desperate it won't work.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
If you make trading complex you won't do well.

Don't work with anyone either, only work for you and get chart experience.

Don't strategy hop, keep charts clean from any indicators and follow market structure as rule no1.

Then follow whatever resonates with you to hit your goals.

That's all I can say. I was a strategy hopper and I wasted so much money... it's insane.

Once I started following market structure on HTF & MTF then I got results but before that I was broke putting my last 1K into brokers.

Honestly, find what works for you and the times you want to trade and then follow it mechanically.

That's how I became profitable enough to make a difference to my family.

Before that, people thought I was a bum and had no idea about trading.

Honestly....

it's a disgusting journey, it's horrible, it's tough, it messes with your ego and it gets you down but once you get over your ego you will enjoy it.. trust me!

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Well that's what forexfactory is about.

My indicator doesn't work for MT4 and I can't force it to work for it either... why would I break my back to make sure it works for everyone?

I'm sharing what is profitable for me and me only.

I don't know any of you... So i'm not obliged to provide anything.

I shared what works for me... I tried to do MT4 and it wont work as MT4 cant calculate real volume data outside of the broker you are using.

So it's not going to be the same results for everyone is it?

If that's the case then I don't need to work outside of my own work for other random people.

I shared what works for me and what I do... that's good enough.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Why you fail: Because you want to be spoon fed information from other people's success when they make it for themselves.

Why you win: You read, take in the information and work with what was offered to make your own decisions.

What I do won't work for everyone so you have to accept that. I shared exactly what changed my life now after so many years. I've been here since 2014 and as soon as I share people don't appreciate it and have their own requests and requirements.

I'll say now, MT4 isn't available right now so if what I've shared works for you then congrats.

If not, move on to a different thread.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I don't understand why you're being so salty because I can't provide you with what you want.

I've been getting daily messages from people saying thank you for what I've shared and it's changed their trading careers.

This is why real profitable traders don't share anything because it ends up being ridiculed if it doesn't work for the audience.

If you want to be unprofitable then go and strategy hop.

From the start I said you need to know market structure FIRST.

Not sure if you know that if you strategy hop.

IF you are profitable... you never need to strategy hop.. Ever...

Market structure is all you need and if you feel like there is an issue here then I can see who knows the markets and who doesn't.

It's so easy... ask any profitable trader.

There is a reason Minotaur quoted me in his successful thread.

If anyone wants to use my indicator then let me know... I'm not a gatekeeper.

But it doesn't guarantee you results.

@RiskFighter

You probably think I'm not nice etc... but what I tried to show is a system that works for me and that's it.

Anything else is extra royalties. I'm not obliged to spoon feed.

I didn't say anything about you needing me

What I was saying is that I don't need to provide anything more for anyone as what I have provided is enough.

Funded challenges are cool but I'm talking about being able to sustain a longer period of income.

Personal income which is what I shared. I just didn't want to provide something I don't personally use myself for the sake of others.

Hi Twist. The end of next year will mark 30 years of trading. I must say, I am not very good, but I do have experience. I just enjoy trading , and I make a living from my business.

Having said that, I recognize top traders right away. You are on my list. Congratulations!

Like Risk Fighter, I trade several accounts with a trade copier: 2 Props and 2 Broker Accounts.I bought a trade copier for 80 bucks.So I placer my trades on Ic Markets, and they are copied on the other ones.

With your performance, having only 1 prop being copied you could multiply your income. I would not recommend more than that. Props are tricky and cheaty.

The only prop I would recommend, actually the only one I intend to keep is FTMO (swing).

My plan is to keep only Ic. Markets and Ftmo. With a real edge, that makes it.

Anyway, thanks again for sharing, and have a great weekend with your family.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I have been following your thread since day one and the results of this indicator are amazing.

However, I am using a rubbish laptop so having trouble with split screen MT4 and Tradingview. so can you send me the MT4 version? I will switch to Ic Markets broker to be similar to tradingview

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Love the indicator! I combine this with fibs, s/d, structure. Can you add arrows on chart? One for color change, and perhaps a "stronger" arrow for color change + signal line confirmation. I know it's very easy to do in pine script. Hope you have the time

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Appreciate what you are doing here bro. I will backtest and follow this Nova system and train myself.

Thanks for sharing, very grateful to see what is working for you.

May I ask how you manage your risk when you enter more than one live trade at a time as you increase your risk with each new live trade?

Would also be interested to know how long you have been trading the system profitably and if you tried other instruments during the early research beofre settling on Gold?

Thanks again.

Thanks xkwisit2001 for this indicator once again. Build a mechanical system based on it, no bias or anything. Backtested 2024 already, results looks promising. Today started forward testing. One lose (-1r) and one win (+2r) for london.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
This strategy works. PERIOD...

But it require you to do your own backtesting and getting into the flow of the symbol you trade.

It might work even if you blindly follow signals, but you have to study the symbol you trade and see what works on that symbol. (What's the best time of day to trade it - how big are the pullbacks on your symbol normally - what risk to reward would be optimal to use on the symbol and so on)

Money management is for me a very big part of trading and the smaller timeframes you trade the more important this becomes - price can whip you out of a trade very quickly.

I aim for 1:3 on my trades on Gold - I started with 1:2 but have found that with the right entries - this is better for me.

How did I come to this conclusion? I did backtesting and live testing - and looked at GOLD to see what it did at the right moments and what it did the times my trades went against me.

And stick with one symbol - get to know it and you will see the profit start running in.

GREED WILL KILL YOUR ACCOUNT - But so will bad money management - and do your top down analysis to know where your support and resistance zones are on the bigger timeframes.

Use tradeview for setups and use your tradeplatform to enter the trade.

Trading is not easy - and if you don't put hours into backtesting and getting to know your symbol you will fail.

Thank you very much for posting your system. Can you send me the indicator for metatrader 4.

Since Wednesday I have traded this system and only had focus on 3 symbols - GOLD and EURUSD - I have done a lot of tweaking and have taken a lot of trades that I should not have entered. But that have just given me more insight into what I should be focusing on and what I should be staying away from.

I try to get into my first trades after New York open optimally I wait 15-30 minutes to see what the marked does.

Some trades I have entered pre New York if I was at my computer and saw a setup that looked good.

I have made a total of 44 trades - and that's properly a bit to many

Wednesday 6/11 (5 trades - 4 win 1 lose 80% win rate - Only Gold) +3,65% - was very conservative on the trades I took

Thursday 7/11 (7 trades - 1 win 6 lose 14% win rate - Only Gold) -4,11% - bad entries upon bad entries - learned a lot

Friday 8/11 (15 trades - 8 win - 7 lose 53% win rate - Only Gold) +4,65% - still experimenting with the entries but was wiser from my mistakes from the previous day.

Monday 11/11 (17 trades - 7 win 10 lose 41% win rate - Gold, EURUSD) +3,41% still experimenting, also included EURUSD because I saw a good setup - but still taking to many trades.

Overall profit doing the 4 last trading days is 7,6% with a win rate of 45%

My biggest win was 3,71% and my biggest lose was 1,31% but on average my losses are much smaller because I cut my losses short before they reach my stop-loss. To many times have I sat and watch my stoploss been taken out and known that it was going to happen - but I don't do that no more.

Psychology in trading is 80% - Management and execution 15% - the last 5% is strategy

For sure I could have made a bigger profit if I had done something different and stayed out of some trades. But then I would not have learned anything. And that's also important if you wanna improve - Always look at what went wrong and how you can avoid it next time.

Can someone please explain the use of coloured candles,there must be a reason for their use.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
If they're deep red it means market has recently heavily expanded to the downside, which means there could be a potential opportunity to trade back in the direction it came from, in this case above. It's a mean reversion concept you can use synergistically with any system. Opposite rules apply to deep blue candles.

Thanks for your reply to my query,but I'm none the wiser. What on earth does "It's a mean reversion concept you can use synergistically with any system" mean?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Not sure how to make it clearer.

Mean reversion is a concept that the LRC embodies.

Any system that can target reversals and pullbacks can use this concept.

Synergistically.

what broker do you use?

i have been trying to use this chart settings on my trading view but its not working, i will really appreciate some help

--- 帖子 #283 ---
can you give more detail as to what isnt working?

Have you selected the Nova indicator and added it to favourites, dont need tochange settings just use default?

Also select the 3sma/ema indicator add to favourites

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Use  50, 100 and 200 EMA settings. Make sure you use IC markets feed for the  pairs you select so you get maximum available volume data.

Thats it.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
is it possible to add this to my free version?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
do i have to have a broker account with them or i can just select IC MARKETS when i want to open any FX pair?

p.s i just want some clarification

--- 帖子 #287 ---
am on free version

--- 帖子 #288 ---
is it same as using different EMAs on chart screen?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Free version allows for 2 indicators so it is fine. By using the 3 ema indicator it counts as one , not 3, so works with free version.

But it is simply 3 EMA'S

when you search for a  currency pair on TV it comes up with 5 or 6 depending on the pair. Just select IC markets. No acount required and free version of TV is fine. It seems you need to spend some time on TV and find your way around. You can get help easier if you have a specific issue.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I am not making any publicity for Ic Markets, but it is the best broker on a raw account for spread, which is almost 0.

I have a "decent raw spread account" with Peperstone, still I get often stopped out too soon or the entry is sluggish because of the spread. Then I have 2 other non- raw accounts, with "low spread" with 2 other "reputable brokers", the spread destroys any system on M1 charts.

M1 is great for me but only with Ic Markets, there are probably other brokers with almost 0 spread out there, but Ic Markets also has a big client volume.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi I am making a checklist for this system:

For Long

-Green shadow.

-Green Bar above Volume MA and 0 line.

Opposite for Short.

(please correct me if I´m wrong).

I only add price and volume diversion.

I am testing, double entry:

-TP R2 on 1

-Trail my way on 2.

I was trying out bollinger bands on your indicator. Imo is important for both exit signals and squeeze breakouts. For example, if I enter at 1m and NV on 15min hits bollinger bands, I am out.

Hope you test it.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi @xkwisit2001. I have been back-testing this system for a while now with pretty good results. I take both short term and slightly longer-term trades. My longer-term system consists of EMA crossovers. Can you please help me with building a system around the Nova Volume indicator and crossovers of 50,200 and 100,200 EMA's? I am pretty good with the position management, Would love to hear your thoughts on entries and overall adjustments to the indicator settings to suit longer-term trades. Btw, I trade futures. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
That's a good one thanks,

I Mixed it with my what's called market structure strategy and it worked pretty well.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi Cuchu,  may I know how do you use 3EMA?

BT

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thanks for the system and great indicator, traded today following your guidelines, 5 wins one loss. When price breaks the 200EMA on the downside and crosses back over, 1st watch before taking the trade, that was my only losing trade.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
You're welcome and thats great! - Did you take the full 1:2s?

So you should be up 9R if so.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Sorry I'm late - that is something I have done previously (copy trade), I also have a business which is the best thing for trading  and I currently have FTMO accounts. The issue I have with the prop account is the spread, but I tend to go for 1:1.5 if using prop. I am glad it's working for you though, just keep on testing and get the confidence to trust Nova... but as with everything trading, knowing structure and also where you are on the HTF is the only way for it to work.

I do also tend to trade breakouts using Nova but I have been waiting to see how people get on with the basics so far.

Is it the free tradingview? - if it allows you to delete an indicator then try that. But let me know what the problem is and I'll look into it.

In the meantime I'll edit the template I use so that it only has 2 indicators.

I have used bollinger bands before but I tend to focus purely on market structure. Pullbacks don't scare me then if that is the case but that is why I just go for 1:2 and then most times I will achieve that and it will reverse.

Hi bud, if you go back through the earlier posts I've explained the longer term entries.

I.e if you use the H1 and the moving averages flip (bullish) then I would wait for the first pullback and then enter on the next nova signal (bullish).

What I do is wait for the 1M/5M chart to also start to go back into an uptrend similar to what the H1 has done after the H1 pullback and start looking for nova entries on those lower timeframes.

Alternatively you could just wait for a strong bullish or bearish bar on the H1 following the trend and then go down to the 1/5M TF which is what I would do.

I can't trade longer term though, I like to have my money off the table as soon as possible as if you trade this on H1 only you'll be waiting a long time for a 1:2 for the same result.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
This!

Gold is a breeze but also FX pairs are amazing with zero spread. Yes you pay a commission but it's so much better this way.

Razor sharp entries and none of that weird manipulation the spread adjusts to not open your positions.

Nothing worse getting the perfect entry and the spread doesn't allow you to get in.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi, just wanted to say thanks for sharing your system.

Been trading it for 2 weeks while also keeping market structure in my mind.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Great! how have you been doing with it?

Everyone don't be afraid to show your trades because I mainly use Gold so it would be great to see everyone elses entries/exits.

It will help others.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I quite enjoyed using this, as it provided just the kind of confirmation that I was looking for when entering a trade. I found there were too many entry points on the 1 minute chart and I was not comfortable with that high frequency of trading. 5 minute seems to be the sweet spot for me.

These are the trades that I took on USDJPY today.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Well looking at those trades you certainly grasped the system. When following the trend and a loss occurs it's time to change your outlook as it could be about to reverse.

As long as you follow structure you will be fine. With the waves you'll find there is usually 3 decent impulse moves and then it will start to range before either continuing or reversing.

Just check a higher tf to see what the trend is and follow structure on the lower tf following the htf structure and you'll be sweet.

Also, you'll see repeatedly how the trend starts to form (when the emas flip/twist) so that first pullback after the flip is usually the best entry setup.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
yeah that’s true, it’s best to wait for a good pullback before entering or the trades tend to get invalidated or the market gets a bit choppy.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Trading done for the day - and what a rollercoaster it was - 16 trades in total -

Gold was retracing on the higertimefra after yesterday's bearish rally, so my bias was bullish on the 1 minute with a few good trades initially and then the choppy shitshow started - I had expected price to retrace further back then it did - but price started to go sideways for a period leading to either loses or small wins.

Overall after 15 trades and two hours of trading i was breakeven - but breaks of structure on the lower timeframes indicated that price would continue the higher timeframe trend, so once a few broken trendlines were confirmed I entered my last trade of the day and hit my tp of 5% after two hours.

Wednesday 6/11 (5 trades - 4 win 1 lose 80% win rate - Only Gold) +3,65%

Thursday 7/11 (7 trades - 1 win 6 lose 14% win rate - Only Gold) -4,11%

Friday 8/11 (15 trades - 8 win - 7 lose 53% win rate - Only Gold) +4,65%

Monday 11/11 (17 trades - 7 win 10 lose 41% win rate - Gold, EURUSD) +3,41%

Tuesday 12/11 (16 trades - 9 wins 7 lose 56% win rate - Only Gold) +5%

After 5 trading days using this strategy as my baseline combined with my own intuition and acquired knowledge I have netted a total of 12,6%

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Fantastic results.

Something to point out to anyone else caught in the chop. If you draw a line across from the low of the previous day you'll see the region of chop was yesterday's low. Price tends to 'bounce' off or chop at these important levels (or sometimes just power on through!), presumably triggering stops of traders who had a good day Monday, and Asian Open breakout stops (traders at breakeven). I hit the same patch, but was anticipating the chop (or powering through), got out and waited for a clear signal of a US open reversal (pretty well the same as your last trade).

This 'pattern' is fairly common in gold and worth trying to commit the 'look' of the day to memory. Nova will help (I use WAE on MT4 and am testing Nova on TV) with confirmation and timing.

Edit:  It's also important to be aware of the timing. At 1430 UK (0930 NY) the main exchanges open.  The 1430 M15 candle creates a new high for the US session and falls away for the next 2-3 hours. Sometimes days it's like clockwork.

Nova Volume Indicator

The Nova Volume Indicator is an innovative trading tool designed to enhance your trading strategy by analysing volume momentum and market dynamics. This indicator empowers traders to make informed decisions by providing clear and actionable buy and sell signals based on real-time data.

How It Works:

The Nova Volume Indicator utilizes advanced algorithms to assess volume changes and price movements. Key features include:

Volume Momentum Calculation: By evaluating the relationship between price changes and volume, the indicator identifies significant momentum shifts, enabling traders to pinpoint entry and exit points with precision.

Trend Direction Filter: The indicator includes a price filter that determines the prevailing market trend based on a moving average. This ensures that trades align with the overall market direction, enhancing the probability of success.

Alert System: With customizable alert thresholds, users receive notifications when momentum crosses defined levels, keeping them informed of potential trading opportunities without the need for constant monitoring.

No Trade Signal: A black background on the histogram indicates that there are no valid trading opportunities at that moment. Use this feature to avoid entering trades during uncertain market conditions.

How to Use the Nova Volume Indicator for Entries:

Identifying the Trend: Before making any trades, check the indicator's trend direction. If the price is above the moving average, focus on bullish signals; if below, look for bearish signals.

Spotting Entries:

Buy Signal: Look for a green histogram bar indicating positive volume momentum. Enter a trade at the close of the candle when the momentum score exceeds your alert threshold and the price is above the moving average.

Sell Signal: A red histogram bar signals negative volume momentum. Enter a short position at the close of the candle when the momentum score falls below the alert threshold and the price is below the moving average.

Setting Stops and Targets: Place your stop-loss below the recent swing low for buy trades or above the recent swing high for sell trades. Aim for a minimum 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio to maximize your profitability.

Customizable Settings:

The Nova Volume Indicator offers several input settings to help you tailor the indicator to your unique trading style:

Signal Period: Adjust the period for calculating the signal line (EMA of momentum score). A shorter period reacts quickly, while a longer one smooths the signals.

Volatility Period: Control the lookback period for assessing market volatility. Shorter periods capture recent fluctuations, and longer periods provide a broader view of price behavior.

Price Filter MA Length: Set the period for the moving average used to filter trades based on price action, helping determine the trend direction.

Alert Threshold: Define the level at which the indicator signals potential buying or selling opportunities. Customize this setting to suit your trading preferences.

The Nova Volume Indicator is a powerful addition to any trader’s toolkit, designed to simplify decision-making and improve trading outcomes. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned trader, this indicator offers the insights you need to navigate the markets confidently. Explore its customizable features to create a unique trading experience tailored to your needs. Start using the Nova Volume Indicator today and elevate your trading journey!

Just want to say it works. If you are struggling strip all the other indicators away and just use the nova and 3ema. If you are getting lost trading on the 1m, zoom out to the 30m or 1h and use a 3m chart to take your entry signals and set stops and targets based on structure.

Beware of CPI - personally I won't be trading before at least 30 minutes after the news.

sounds like a good idea. i'm having difficulty getting entries on M1

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hey, I was wondering if an experience trader can comment on this trading strategy with nova:

1. Check if important new incoming, if yes within 1 hour(before and after), do not trade and only trade within NYS:

2. Go on daily TF and check for trend using MA, and other confluence and determine either sell or buy:

3. Go on 15 min time frame and check for Nova signal that matches Daily trend:

4. If Nova== signal, Check whether the slope ema on 15min is in the same direction:

5.Place Trade at market, but if market closing within 1 hour, ignore

6.If Nova indicator completely changes sign(went long and nova gave a red background), stop trade

7. If Nova indicator gives a black background, check wheter the ema present on Nova is positive or negative, if the ema is in opposite sign with trade, stop

8.If daily TF bias changes, stop trade.

Now, what I need help with is where and how to implement st and tp, in this strat, there is no defined tp and sl and I'm trying to ride with the trend as long as possible. From my prev strat, it would usually be fine to do this, but with massive stops(100 pips), will such an implementation work? The conditions for this strat are already very specific.

Moreover, could someone explain the underlying principle that the Nova Indicator uses? I get that it's profitable and works, but I'm wondering HOW is it profitable, what "principle" does it use to be so succesful? Also, I convert this strat into an algo, was wondering if nova would still work(with the conditions presented above) or is Nova purely made only for humans?

Any tip would help, thank you!

MRN - we see a spike to yesterdays NYO high and there is no momentum. FOr the next hour price is in a 50 pip box and seems to be working the high - no doubt pulling traders long. Then NY equity open and we get an engulfing with confirmation from Nova to go short. It may be a bit early but the candle engulfs and then we get a pin bar. 2nd entry also lined up.

Edit: 3pm in the UK and I've taken 3 trades after the news.  The first was a fail, about 15 minutes after the news, which I closed before the SL was hit and noticing there was no momentum behind the move. The next 2 came after the NY equity open and both tagets were hit.  I've left a 3rd of each open and will trail them down to yesterdays low, maybe further if the move looks solid.

You're banned

This is the problem, that guy just wanted to code his own Nova and probably sell it.

He wasn't interested in anything else and had to get him out once he said there was no defined tp or sl.

The joys

--- 帖子 #322 ---
It's really interesting to see how everyone interprets their entries and they end up being the same as you mentioned.

That's why I said Nova is subjective and to use with your current arsenal. That way it seamlessly fits in and you'll probably end up only using nova as a single indicator.

It's what happened to me. Hope you're enjoying it and it'll be nice to see how things pan out over time for you forward testing. But those percentages are solid and any investor would work with you if you bring in those results each week!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Yeah - same same but different!  I like the indi and I thing xkwisit2001 is doing a good job trying to make it mechanical, but intraday is hard without a decent understanding of market structure and price action.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I think understanding of elliott wave or market maker model is the best way to trade, especially with Nova (personally).

Once there is a rejection and a new trend starts you will find that price will push down 3 times with small pull backs along the way and then 2 corrective larger pull backs which is where you would use the fibonacci to look for entries around the 61.8 area.

As shown below from Gold M1 - Hope you get what I mean. If not, study E Wave & market maker model

Once you get that, you know where in the trend you are.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is a proper example of EW. You can see in 1 impulse move up there are 3 impulse moves up on the lower tf.

So if you use 15M/M1 you can follow trends that way like below.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Yes, I have tried to look for mechanical systems that would work - but they always have some flaw and I have come to the conclusion that price action and market structure is required to make it work to its fullest.

But I do think the Nova indicator xkwisit2001 has made is really really good - and if you follow it you will be able to see results.

I was not completely finished today and took a quick scalp - this time using the nova for entry - but again, also had confluens in a trendline break and break of structure after a pullback.

Guys make sure to study the results of TranceGhosts and the charts provided as he/she has picked up how to use Nova extremely well.

It all goes back to understanding the following: Market Structure: Higher Highs, Higher Lows, Lower Lows, Lower Highs. Breaks of highs and lows and what may happen after. Body breaks & Wick breaks. Double Tops & Bottoms etc... (Research market structure as it is the foundations). Elliott Wave Theory: This is like trading GPS. To understand where in the market you are. Impulse or Corrective. It is fractal so it happens on every timeframe. Spotting trends with EMA: You want to see how the start of a trend forms, using my EMA's you'll see the first impulse move break the 200EMA and then all 3 EMA's will begin to twist/flip. NOVA (Entry/Exit Model/My Strategy): Once you understand the first 3 then you want to look at Nova signals and how they occur when mixed with impulse and corrective moves. Trust me, if you learn #1-3 above you will have the foundations to be profitable & I'm not lying. Any experienced trader will agree.

Number 4 (Nova) is subjective because again, this is what works for me and it may not work for you.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Another example of NOVA in the just the past THREE HOURS!

I marked out a 10R trade just to show what can be possible even if you did decide to hold or take partials.

There are losses but without a doubt there is no way you cant be profitable with this.

The yellow X's on the histogram are entries I wouldn't have taken because sometimes there will be these weird high volume pushes that then end up reversing...

Once price gets near the EMA's it tends to enter them to reset and go again for continuation so be mindful of that.

21R available below

--- 帖子 #328 ---
See these strong spikes on Nova tend to create a pullback

You could even use them as an indication to exit your position if holding onto trades for a bigger R:R.

On the histogram they will usually occur around the +200 & -200 areas.

Good Luck!

Look at your 5M Gold Nova, there were 2 great entries

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Always be checking the signal line (my yellow line on histo) and see what it's doing.

If it is above the zero level in a downtrend then don't take any red background histogram signals.

Wait for the signal line to cross the zero level first.

You can plot horizontal lines if you like... this could help when doing MTF i.e mark a line when price is passing your higher timeframe zero level and then you will see it on the lower timeframes.

That way, you know you're with the higher timeframe signal line and you can start looking for signals on the lower timeframe.

It looks fine to me, the white background would be black for dark mode.

The candles are my own colour as I don't like red and green as it affects the mind.

Trading is 80% mindset and the rest is whatever works for you.

If you go back you'll see I said the background would be black or white which is when you shouldn't trade.

Look at all the green backgrounds.... perfect trades.

It's not the best time to trade right now but test it out.

Good morning

I want to share something that changed my performance radically, which is closer to the original thread system.

I am used to entering on an M1, HA Bar close, above or below that bar on a Stop order.

Now, just entering the Market right after the M1 closed makes a huge difference; 2 R TP is much easier to reach.

Yesterday I had 3 winners and 1 small loser.

If I had used this entry, all 3 winners would have reached the 2 R TP with a 5,6 R total. But I ended with 2,6 R total. Which is not bad, but the difference is massive. In the long run, it can make or break a good system.

That is a massive difference.

FOMO is my worst enemy.

Late entry is the best recipe for

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Greed will kill an inexperienced trader - letting winners turn into losers. I can't count how many times I have let that happen to myself. So taking profit or tightening your stop-loss is in my book a good option. I closed a trade yesterday in 3% profit - had i let it run it would have gone into 10%. But that does not really bother me cause I sticked to my plan and didn't let emotions get away with me.

When you get wins you will boost your moral and that will give you confidence in your system.

Psychology is 80% of trading and it's hard to master - but once you have fully confidence in your system - It will be much easier to let your runners run and get full buck for your money.

So what you do now is good - you win and that's perfect - the more you win the more confident you get and that's a good feeling.

I used to have FOMO and was trading all day long every option I saw and have lost several thousand dollars doing so.

But now I have a scheduled window I trade and I rather just wait until my window open and even sit over on a trade cause I know, the next setup is just around the corner.

And trading 1 minute charts - that corner is just a few minutes away - so no reason to overtrade. Look at some of the charts xkwisit2001 has posted. There is setups all the time

No, Not for me. We have a bearish bias at that point - price is below ema - nova has been printing bearish signals.

I know we are printing higher lows and price is retracing but the overall trend i SELL and until price goes above ema and we see clear higher highs followed by a pullback and a nova entry going long we keep selling only.

I know the ? wasn't aimed at me but in my system it would be a no trade but with experience it could be a buy signal. However, it's going against the trend so I would be careful with those entries.

Background is black for a reason as Nova doesn't see it as a valid entry, however as you can see once nova gave the proper signal (where you captioned) that is why there would have been 2 wins.

For me, I would just wait as its a downtrend.

Those random strong red bars that didn't end up breaking structure looks likely to be when small liquidity grabs occur.

Hi xkwisit2001,

Thanks for your system, so far, it's working nice through the London & New York session. I've tested it three days and realized that the more momentum we had the more precision that the Nova can give to us.

Also here is last 6 trades on GOLD, M1. With 5 win, 1 lose. I set my R:R=1:1.5 so it will easier to reach the TP. Still forward test it more and more

Again. Thank you very much for your Nova system

A London open trade on Gold.  Asian session dropped, then a pump back up into London, and sideways consolidation in a 100 pip box, which compresses to 50. The first dump down through the low of the session could have been an entry, but the pullback and entry on the 2nd wave of Nova worked well (and the EMA's are starting to space out more).  I targetted the ADR, and took some off at the round number levels.   If I wasn't already out, then the big spike was probably a good warning. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hello everyone,

So far next 3/3 trades with GOLD are TP with 1.5R. I've noticed that we can look at the second bar histogram, in these cases, if the second bar is longer than the first bar, this is valid and give you more chance to win the trade. I attached the image below. Hope this help.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I've noticed this too, you want to enter with increasing volume,  and be cautious with decreasing volume.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
It's great to see so many of you getting used to Nova so well.

1:1.5 is something I would recommend, I used to target that amount but then I realised it often hits 1:2 very often so if I get a loss the extra .5 will give boost profits and erase the losses over time.

I can't use any other indicator really, I just have so much confidence in it so I don't care if I lose anymore

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Just updated, and thank you very much for the Nova & big thanks to xkwisit2001

Next 3/3 trades are win. Total time I start trading from 8:00 PM (Vietnam time) until now.

Total 12 trades, 11 win, 1 loss, only buy follow the trend, with R:R=1.5

It's very very nice.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
whats your max trade and risk per trading day?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
If at the start of a new trend I'll risk 1-2% max then take half off at 1:1 and let it run to 1:2 or higher.

Will stop trading if I get 3 losses in a row which is rare.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I'm curious, would you have taken these two trades today during NY session? My analysis - price made higher high's and higher lows after a short downtrend in a

bullish trend.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
The best signals are the ones that appear after a pullback to the moving averages during an uptrend so the best entry would have been 11 bars before your first entry with stop loss below the low.

Once price moves away from the moving averages and breaks a high it will want to soon pullback so I'd get a bit weary.

Your first entry was valid, although I do prefer there to be more red bars and a bigger pullback (it only went to 38.2 fib).

The 2nd entry I wouldn't have taken because of the abnormal volume hitting above +200 and then the volume after was lower (I have marked this on your chart below)

I also marked where I would have entered but your first entry is a mistake that is easy to make... especially with gold.

I didn't take any of those entries though.

Try focusing on the signals that appear when price is breaking out from the moving averages with signal line above zero level

Great wasted trade. Worry about MM and not the entry.

I can appreciate meaningless indicators and effort to nail down the entry, but it is meaningless. PA will do what PA will do. MM is where it's at.

So many wasted years on FF(including mine) to search for perfect entry and not to pay attention to MM. Glad I found my HoGr in MM few years ago.

I try to preach this message in a few threads..hopefully it will help aspiring traders.

GBP JPY.  Major Red News at 0700, had little impact on the market. Price pulled back to the EMAs, and started to pull away. Took a small entry first as I wasn't totally confident that the news shakeout was over.  The 2nd entry was not a 'new' Nova signal, (Nova was still giving a strong sell), but the start of the 15 minute rotation, and an engulfing candle, 3rd another engulfing. 4th entry was a new nova signal, and I think a mistake as the signal line was retracing and price was in consolidation.  A better 4th entry was a few bars later.

I left a 1/3rd of each position open with a TP set to the previous week close (this move had some momentum, but the longer-term trend was still long).

I think I understand what driven18 is getting at, but not all indicators are useless (too many are a distraction, and relying solely on an indicator will lead to trouble).  A decent indicator (i.e. Nova, but also the simple EMA and the candlestick chart), models the market, simplifying the raw tick data.  Being models, they are are never 100% accurate, but some are useful. Their purpose (IMHO) is to improve situational awareness (e.g. I use fractals and EMA's to give me an 'at a glance' view of market structure), and support decision making. You can better Observe the market, Orientate to the current situation, Decide what to do and Act (John Boyds famous OODA loop).

Nova seems to offer a decent confirmation that there is momentum for an entry. You can't use it in isolation but when it aligns with market structure, key price levels, and time rotation, it is useful.

For any new traders stumbling across this thread and seeing the fantastic results, my advice is to spend time getting to understand price action, in particular the key levels (daily/weekly highs/lows) and timings (15 minute and hourly rotation).  Stacey Burke Trading on youtube will give some really valuable lessons on how the markets move.

While typing this the PWC target was hit (197.65) and may well continue, but it's been a good morning.

@tablespoon can you explain please what is 15minutes 1 hour rotation is?

Talking about Market structure, retracements and Fibos.

There´s a not-so-secret fibo: 0,86, roughly the square root of 0,76.

The point is it tends to be very powerful.Even on a monthly chart.

If you mark at the beginning of the day the major points: yesterday's H/L, major swing points, and especially Day levels, then mostly the M1 chart heads towards those points (strange attractors, liquidity meat for the algos!). So it is safe to trade in the 100EMA direction, but only till those levels are reached or are very close. That is where one might want to risk a "counter-trend trade).

Check this M1 chart this morning (Too bad I was sleeping).

EURUSD bounces on 0,86 level, at the EMA 100, and the green NOVA signal follows on the next bar.

Added confirmation,the stochastic RSI oscillator below shows 3 green levels, meaning green is oversold on 6 different settings.

Btw. EURUSD is 92% correlated with GOLD on the M5. And both are big targets for the Big Boys Algos.

Well said! Any system shared on this site is always from someone else’s perspective and never guaranteed to work. We all have our own unique approaches, challenges, and mindsets when it comes to trading—the classic 80% psychology aspect of it.

I’ve been profitable for a number of years now. By that, I mean it pays the bills and lets me enjoy the occasional treat now and then (lol).

That said, trading is such a personal journey. We all need to find the tools that help things click. For me, it happened when I started focusing on volume and momentum, and how they align with market structure. But even then, I could never condense everything I know into one system.

That’s why I always encourage people to first understand how the market works—learn Price Action as your foundation. From there, add anything that complements your mindset, if needed.

So while Nova has been working well for me, it might not work for someone else—and that’s just the nature of this game.

One day, it’ll all click for you, and you’ll wonder why you spent so long chasing every indicator under the sun. Master market structure and price action, and you’ll have an incredible starting point.

Happy Friday, and wishing you all green pips!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
This is only relevant to intraday scalpers and getting off-topic.

What I mean is, when you are focused on the m1, be aware of where you are in the M15 and H1 candles, both in terms of the OHLC AND the time (H4 too).  The start of a 15-minute or hour cycle is often a good place to start looking for an entry.  If you're into the last 3 or 4 minutes of a 15 minute cycle, be sure of the entry as there tends to be a pull back at the end/start of the cycle (same for hour) - these are the candle wicks on higher timeframes.  In a trade, monitor price at the main levels (25,50,75,00 for FX and 50/00 for gold), AND time rotations (ready to close out some or all, add in, adjust my stops or do nothing). Take a look at sessions that have traded well.  They will be 'well-engineered' with a spike around the H1 rotation (or half past for the NY equity open), then 2 or 3 M15 candles that really move the price, followed by consolidation for 15-45 minutes, then a continuation or reversal.

I will start making notes on Excel on the dreaded sideways periods  on M1: how many EMA 100 clear closed candles until it finally runs away in one direction.

The last one this morning was 4 times, between 12 and 12:31.Then it ran up.

A picture better than words, I menat clear separation from the EMA, after crossing.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
If the EMA's are flat or very close to each other then price will just range. I just mark the high and low and wait for the first strong breakout and wait for a retracement to start entering.

The key is waiting for the EMA's to fan out again either up or down and wait for that first pullback to start rocking on!

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Sorry for the long write up but this is what I do when I think a new trend might be forming - my process:5M Zero Line Cross (Red Line):

When the 5M Nova crosses down the zero line, it’s my heads-up that it could be time to start looking for sells and a new 1M trend might be starting. But I don’t jump in yet—confirmation is key.

Marking Structure Breaks (Pink Lines):

I look for the low that broke structure on the 1M chart. This shows me sellers are starting to take control.

I mark that low and the retracement high (pink lines) to define the range I’ll work with.

Wait for the Break:

Now it’s a waiting game. I’ll sit tight and wait for either the low or high to break before making any moves.

Next Retracement and Nova Confirmation:

After the next structure break, I wait for a retracement. Here’s where Nova comes in again—if it confirms momentum is in my direction, that’s when I’ll look to enter.

Patience Is the Game:

This isn’t about rushing in; it’s about waiting for everything to line up. Most bad trades happen because people can’t wait. A Few Extras I Use:Fibs: During retracements, I pull Fibonacci levels and look for reactions around the 50%-78.6% zone. This often lines up nicely with Nova confirmation for a cleaner entry.

Stops & Targets: My stop usually goes above the retracement high, and I stick to at least a 1:2 RR. No point risking more than what the trade can give.

Multi-Timeframe Alignment: I make sure the 1M and 5M trends are pointing in the same direction to avoid getting chopped up. It’s all about being patient and letting the setup come to you. If you rush, the market will punish you for it.

Hi,

I found this indicator helpful for entry confirmation after price action analysis.

It is subjective. I have 4 years of experience in the forex market and gold especially.

Once you have mastered the price action and apparently, the market structure then this indicator will help you to get a water bucket on each wave of the ocean and that's what you really need.

As advised by the thread poster, you can't rely solely on Nova. You'll get wrecked

Go learn price action and market structure and use Nova for extra confluence and entry point for consistency and discipline

Combining price action, market structure, and trading session(volume time) & Nova will make you a profitable trader.

I was struggling for the entry point and here Nova came. I just found it yesterday and back-tested it many times.

Found some tricks on how to apply it effectively for better results.

I will still backtest it these 2 days on the weekend and will start applying it on Monday on a real account. Then I'll share the results.

Best of luck to all and thanks to  xkwisit2001 for this indicator

PA is flat coming out of the news. Forms a ~50 pip box, then expands the range to the high and low, dragging in traders. Equity open at 1430 (UK) and at 1445 I get a signal that I am happy with. A dump down, pump back up and a (single bar) retracement continuation at the start of the next 15 minute candle. Nova tells me there is some weight here so I'm happy to make an entry. 1:2 Target but I'll watch and see esp around the 1500 rotation).

My main concern at this stage is the 200 ema is still quite flat, and price is still in the pre-news range.

EDIT: closed at BE on the new H1 candle - lets see!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Gold's been rough today. Locked in my 4.5R win but gave back 2R, so +2.5R on the day.

Not touching anything else until this range finally breaks (and honestly, it doesn’t look like it’s happening today but lets see eh). Typical boring Friday vibes.

For anyone curious about the pink & blue dots on my chart: they’re minor & major Fib points. Handy for mapping out market structure.Blue dots = major swing points (higher timeframe, e.g. 5M for me). Pink dots = minor swings (1M chart). If you want the TV script: Major/Minor Fib Points

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Well said - I was trying to go long when price was still bouncing around inside of the range.  I normally mark off the high and low of the day and should have seen this before attempting the long (I was trading into the high of the day - I should have waited for it to break or do what it ended up doing which was fail to break out).

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You can see a clear triple top on the m1 which signals a market reversal.  I took one for a 1:2 but packed up for the day - looks like there were more opportunities to be had.  Patience pays in this game.

Hi all, i just gone through this thread and I felt impressive by the knowledge shared in first 2 pages of this thread.

So, I gave an try, faced losses and again gone through whole thread and gained some knowledge again

So started MTF analysis.  I open the chart check for 1h trend and drop down to 1m for entries.

So, I did a trade on friday on real account, where I won 2 trades and 2 breakeven.  I move my SL to breakeven after the trade hit 1:1.

I'm doing the right thing in trading? Or any suggestions you people want ne to give?.

I'll Start to post the trade in this thread from Monday onwards to get more clarity from you people. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
hi @xkwisit2001, thanks for confirming on the EMA ange, can i ask another question on the same trade and chart, please see below, so the rules of entry are when there is a strong candle (usually second one) however based on the trade you took the second candle was weaker significantly than the one before it.

Any insight you can provide as to your thinking then and slight change to the rules? thanks again for your help upto now

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I have an account for longer-term trades (trades lasting a minimum of a few days but normally a few weeks, and sometimes a few months when the swaps are good).   I'm doing a bit of backtesting to see how this could have helped on previous trades and I'd suggest longer-term traders take a look.

A quick look at using Nova on a higher timeframe over the last couple of months on GBPUSD...
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In this case, I'm using xkwisit's guide to look first at the higher timeframe.  On D1 I've marked out the signal line crosses zero.  Even without further analysis, it looks tradeable.

Dropping down to H4 for the entry, it looks like a lot of entry confirmation signals, when used in conjunction with the EMAs and basic PA.  We would have stayed out of the D1 longs as there was no confirmation on the H4.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Just eyeballing it the 1:2 rule should work fine. However, I use a very different approach for longer-term trading using much smaller entries but many more of them, locking in breakeven quickly and then letting the positions run. The time when Nova has a black background could be used as a signal to take some profit. The D1 signals would be a sign to monitor the full position more closely.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I took that trade out of instinct because of the bullish volume before it and also the small red bars that came after it.

So as soon as it went green it was go time for me.

Plus the signal line was way above the zero level indicating bullish momentum was with me.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
My best kept secret is that I use davits weekly fibonacci levels for take profit. So it's not uncommon for me to get 1:10+ frequently when doing this.

Didn't add that here simply because I wanted to show the system as a foundation instead of flooding everyone with too much information.

You definitely know what you're doing though and it's nice to see.

Hi buddy, you're overtrading and trading at the wrong time.

There is no news today so volume would be low during london session by default.

Price also didn't break the recent low or high during london so you should wait for confirmation of a break.

You were trading in a range which would = whipsaw

The moving averages were also very close to each other and not fanned out showing low momentum.

Hello

Do you count the previous 2 entry signals as valid ?

--- 帖子 #403 ---
If you mean the ones you have marked then the first one no because it only just broke the high.

The second entry you took is something that would fit as a nova signal so it would have been a loss.

However, gold really likes to fakeout/grab liquidity from below the first pullback that broke the high before heading up so I usually like to look for entries after the 61.8 - 70% area on the fib has been tested.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
how do you apply the fib tool , any advice as i have not used fibs but they do look good pal?

--- 帖子 #405 ---
My really first day using this system throughly, but RR and some criterias are not followed strictly. I was trading NY session.

The system signals go pretty good after pullback on Gold today. But I have only 2 trades (78.19 profit and 117.5 profit) really satisfied me although the RR was not really good.

3% up to day on funding demo account. Hope I can go well with Nova system!

the first one no because it only just broke the high. --- how do you assess this? when you say just broke it, should there be a % or something to gage if the break is too small ? thanks

When following the market you need to mark the recent high and low.

If inside a range 1 of the 2 needs to break in order to start creating a bias to go long or short.

So if we are looking to break structure during an uptrend then you need to mark the high that needs to be broken.

When there is a body break of the high then you want to wait for price to pull back and then for a nova buy signal to appear.

In the case I showed earlier, with gold... especially around NY open price likes find liquidity before it makes a move which means it may pull back and induce sellers to jump on board before it swings higher.

Usually if price wants to go UP it will break the high, then break the recent swing low and then create the real move to go up... (Taking both sides of liquidity).

It's the opposite usually when price wants to go down.

I have mentioned previously, to use this system you need to understand market structure and price action as a foundation.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Just to add to my previous message:

The reason why you want the moving averages to fan out during a trend is so tht 50ema can act as a support.

That way you can be confident with taking nova entries with stops below pull backs.

If the emas are almost flat price won't respect them and basically do what it wants.

If emas are close together or going flat then mark the high and low that needs to break and set alerts slightly above and below.

Then go about your business till you receive an alert

As long as those moving averages start to fan out you should be golden to follow nova.

Just noticed a massive flurry of people on the poll say the system doesn't work

Wonder who is against this thread hmmmmmmmmmm

Some poor soul has created tonnes of accounts in the past 19 hours voting to say the system doesn't work

Wow - that's bizarre behaviour - a cry for help maybe

Yeah click the accounts that voted and you'll see. I thought it was weird but oh well lol

@xkwisit2001 Bro I just started to use your idea, and I managed to catch 6% in a few hours.

I just wanted to say thanks man.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
GREAT CALL and it went up

--- 帖子 #448 ---
took the same trade, reading the thread since morning, I find this strategy interesting.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Aha thanks, managed a good few entries today. Perfect trending day but had to get out of the muddy waters first.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Following the ebbs and flows of Nova does help a lot. I have actually been testing out using heiken ashi candles instead with Nova.

They definitely help with psychology for sure.

I also recommend using different coloured candles too

This is my TV template if anyone wants to use it

--- 帖子 #451 ---
so thankful pal for all your support, advice and allowing use of your amazing Nova Indicator, still learning but must admit one of the most straightforward systems i have come across with all the usual BS you find on most (not all mind you) threads out there cut out

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Yeah no worries dude. This is why it's taken me so long to even bring a system here to FF because I've been through the early days of strategy bouncing, testing something out for a few days and then moving on again if I took any losses.

You realise after a while that you're just making dumb mistakes following everyone else's strategies solely as you'll never really achieve what they are doing.

This is why Nova is a confluence 1st and my strategy comes 2nd. As long as you're following market structure and knowing when to and when not to trade then you'll be profitable at least.

Consistency comes when you realise what actually works for YOU and then you tailor your trading life around that.

Glad you like the thread

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Two more trades I have taken today on us30

--- 帖子 #454 ---
NOVA doesn't work

11 wins in a row IF you took them all (22R)

Surely someone took at least 1 of them lol

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Great advice !!

--- 帖子 #456 ---
The first trade was incorrect bud. No red nova bars with signal below zero level.

But 2nd trade was fine. Keep it up but just wait for the signal line to cross 0 level with some red bars (ideally 2) before entering with stops above the high. [opposite for buy trade]

--- 帖子 #457 ---
NOVA works. For me I am just waiting for the MT4 version. To have 5 indicators on the chart I cannot use the basic plan of TV, I have to upgrade.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
If anyone had the balls to hold this on NAS100... Wow 27R in 1 trade.

As you can see, it really is calculating the volume.

Just do both, I'll typically scalp NQ, US30, and Gold, taking best setups amongst these 3

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I will, but the thing with me is that I hate using more than 1 at a time. Don't ask me why... my brains just weird like that

My earliest days was EURUSD, then I moved to GER30 (GER40) and got REKT so I wouldn't touch indices for a while and then when I found consistency I moved over to gold.

Not much of an adventurer, I tend to find my baby and then stay loyal if she's good to me - can't have too many wives lol

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I tried it out today with Forex. I scanned through all the pairs about 8:15am found 11 that would qualify at thew time on the 5 min 8 wins 2 losses and 1 BE 2 to 1 risk fantastic. I don't know if it was beginners' luck but will see tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #464 ---
i am using basic plan without an issue and loaded the Nova indicator

--- 帖子 #465 ---
The way he trades he prefers 5 indicators which you can't do with basic plan.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
It's not beginners luck... it just works if it works within your own system

--- 帖子 #467 ---
5 indicators = unprofitable

The more indicators on the chart, the less profit.

Too many things to watch which affect the brain

I literally use 1 indicator.. Nova... 4 If not lol  Nova Pivots 3 Emas Brain If I had to choose 2 it would be Nova & Fib Pivots. I don't really need the EMA's.

Brain isn't an indicator on TV.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
8.8R from just waiting for 2 opposite heiken ashi in a row.

Sorry, the candles are hidden behind the TV banner.

NAS100 M1

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I agree, just explaining to this guy. However this is only really true in a vacuum. We don't know what system and types of indicators he could be using. It's best not to project your biases as truth.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I can even trade without nova. I'm just saying when there's 5 indicators, there's too much brain power and processes going on to eventually say... 'enter trade'.

If he's profitable with 5 indis then hats off. But when I was unprofitable it's because I had way too many indicators on chart because I was just adding everyone elses indicators to my chart that I liked and was confused for like 2 years lol.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I agree but again that's just your experience. For every ONE of you there's FIVE profitable traders who use 5+ indicators. Can't preach subjective practices as facts by saying things like ...more indicators the less profit. But you can recommend practices that work for you and people can choose to learn.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Good stuff, any plans for mt4 version?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
There won't be one for MT4 unfortunately. You just have to adjust to TV.

TV is the best out here, for like 3 years I only execute on MT4 but all analysis is done on TV.

There is an app or something that connects to MT4 to execute trades if you're a serious trader.

But for me, I just use 2 screens and take trades when there's a signal.

I tried to get an MT4 indicator going but the way the TV indi is coded is primarily based on real volume and tick data 2nd.

MT4 is always only tick data so it's harder to code and I've had a few people try from the forex factory community and it doesn't work right

--- 帖子 #474 ---
good point ... too many indicators causes mass confusion, many top traders say one thing and that is going back to the basics and that is PA as all indicators are lagging

--- 帖子 #475 ---
You trade mostly M1? What about M30, H1? Does this strategy work also?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
It's true. Once you become profitable you remove indicators... it's natural.

Because of chart time... it's like learning a new language.

Eventually you don't need a tutor.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I trade higher TF's but day to day M1 or M5.

Depends on what I'm doing. If I have to meet my bro abroad then i'll find a H1 setup but I'll still execute on at least M5.

I always use HTF and zoom in on M1/M5 for entry.

It works on all timeframes. If trading H1 and nova gives a sell signal then you can dial down for entry on a lower TF unless u wanna wait 3 days for a 1:2 TP.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Nova @ work

Lets see if it hits 1:2

It's a break for Nas100 so have to wait.

35m till market open. Bit risky with market close but let's see.

EDIT: LOSS

--- 帖子 #479 ---
And you use it mostly on gold, nas100 etc... so mostly high volatility pairs works best?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I do many things but if I had to turn it into a strategy, what I've mentioned here is the best way.

The issue is, most people teach... I don't. I'm saying use Nova as a confluence.

So it doesn't matter what I do with it, it's all about what others do with it but it works for me.

I prefer high volatility... Nothing worse than waiting all day for a 20 pip move on EURUSD only for it to reverse 20 pips and BE which I've done many times.

Indices or Gold are for people who don't have patience lol... like me.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Been getting some real weird messages from people on here about the Nova indicator.

I had one offer to buy it.. and then like another 2 hrs later someone else (same day).

Almost as if it shouldn't be on here and I'm exposing something.

Dno if its normal on here for others with threads but i'm being offered weird money for the script lol

I have a strange feeling it's someone from a TV indicator company but I can't be sure. They usually buy peoples indicators and package them up in a monthly sub.

I won't be entertaining anyways... NOVA is mine

--- 帖子 #482 ---
That's happened to me before. It's never worth going down that road, it always leads to sketchiness and a big waste of time. "Hey man, this indicator is way too good, let's put together a team and package it up and sell it. You'll be the coder , I'll be the operator, and we'll split the profit". Next thing you know  your signing NDAs in a telegram channel with a bunch of weirdos. Just keep doing what you're doing man and let your profit on the markets tell your success.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
At least it's not just me!!!

Glad you said. I don't need any money from anyone but it's weird. Yesterday I had like 30 fake accounts downvote the thread poll. I'm guessing it's that person so they could try and make me give away the code cheap.

Trading is such a mad environment.

But I defo wouldn't sell the script for £40k LOL dumbasses

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Interesting.  I've tried on and off for several years to incorporate volume into my trading and have never been able to using MT4 data, either vanilla or integrated into an indicator.  I've read a lot about how tick volume tracks real volume and how they are closely correlated, but have a feeling that while this may be true, it is where they do not 100% correlate that is important.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
GBPJPY first trade of the day just after the UK Equity open. I've used Nova and EMA's to scan my watchlist FX (GBP and EUR pairs excluding NZD), Gold, Dax and FTSE. A few of the FX pairs look interesting.

A quick analysis of GBPJPY

H1 chart (for weekly analysis) shows what looks to be a failed breakout of the weekly high, and a break in structure. On the daily chart this gives a pinbar. Anyone going long GBP yesterday or this morning is trapped with a red trade. We're also seeing red on Nova but even without it - this is a signal that the market could short (other GBP pairs are looking similar).

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On the M15 I'm seeing the EMA's aligning. Flicking through my shortlist of markets, I'm looking for something that looks like the area marked by a box. It happens again into the London open and the entry can be taken on a lower timeframe. Again we are seeing a lot of big red bars on Nova.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On the M1 for entry. Use price action and Nova for entries on the 1 minute chart. 2 decent 1:2 entries. I like to let the winners run so keep ~1/3 of each entry open after the 1:2 is hit, and will target a larger move, in this case the 195 price level looks promising, maybe further depending on how the price moves this morning.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

For me capital preservation is my priority and if there is no momentum (or momentum stalls after I've entered) I'll either get out or move my stops to break even.

EDIT: 195 price target hit - done for the morning.

EDIT EDIT: watching GBPJPY now and I'm thinking a trailing stop would have been better!

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I thought I was done, but there's volatility this morning and this was a great EURUSD setup coming into the new hour.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dotted red 0900, and we see a spike above a recent high, an engulfing candle at 0901 followed by a pin bar.  This signals a high probability short, and I'll risk a bigger %.  Nova is red and the signal line is passing through 0.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Afternoon trades XAUUSD M1.

4 trades, 1 lose, 3 wins. Totaly 5R.

You see as soon as you get a loss with nova it means price is reversing.

2 in a row means stop trading as it's most likely ranging.

@ xkwisit2001

I've been testing your strategy on NAS100 M1 for over a week, and it's legit. I caught a 1:3 this morning. I'm an experienced trader, so I have my ways.

It also works during the Asian session on Nas100. Nova produces many, many trading opportunities.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Yeah dude if there is a trend in sight nova will retire you lol

Once you get a loss just mark the high and low that needs to break and wait till 1 does and you can continue.

I am trading nas100 today for the first time in ages so will see how it does for me. Volume coming in 10 mins so I'm ready for it.

Happy it's working for you!

--- 帖子 #498 ---
That was a minute or 2 into the open.  I took the short as price had just popped above the previous day high, and Nova turned red.  Just trail the minute candle high all the day down. This is obviously not part of the strategy you suggested but something I'm going to take a closer look at using this around the open, and at key levels.

(And there's another 1:2+ short from the pullback to the new low).

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I think this may be an issue with TV (not nova specific) but thought I should check.  Every now and then I lose Nova, it just disappears.  To get it back I just re-select it, but then the original one (that I thought I had lost) pops back up too.  I'm an MT4 old hand so probably doing something wrong.  Does anyone know if it's me or a known issue?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Aha my system is for me... if you work something else out then that's for you and it's amazing.

Your system might be better than mine, I'm having to target 1:4's now lol

hi, guys, happy for your earnings, still to figure to find a perfect setup

was trying to scalp forex on 5m & 1min---> 5min sweep and enter towards context on m1 but so far 1 win & 3 losses.

Want to try to focus on indices as I am working full time and in the London time from 8pm to market close(10pm) it's kow volume, this will be a good period to trade as I have time but no ooportunities.

Just to ask if you watch on TV NAS100 & S&P500, you paid for real time data, or how you proceeded here?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
If you pay you will get real volume which is best but just use USTEC Ic Markets if you don't want it to be delayed.

My broker is IC so it's the same in MT4 but nothing beats real volume, I've just paid for it.

Great to hear!

What changes did you make?

My biggest issues at the moment are just waiting for a clear trend / FOMO.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I use a Jurik MA which changes colors.

Also for trailing.

That is it.

Best way of using Nova I found, for myself so far. I trade only EURUSD but once I get solid I will look at maybe Gold or Nasdaq.

I did not take that, too many news today, but even without news runs like these are there for the grab.

(Thanks again xkwisit!)

hello .

first i really thank you for what you brought . i really like nova

i am looking for a way to set an alert when there are conditions like you said . or just price moves from colorless to colored area but i still don't know how to do it . can you tell me how to set that alert

--- 帖子 #515 ---
On tradingview go to alerts and create new.

It has 2 alert types for bullish and bearish momentum to choose.

Another one I will include in the update is for then the zero line is crossing zero.

When I am back home I'll also post how to do it.

First 5 Minute candle is usually where orders will be so do a backtest and you'll see some razor sharp entries.

Didn't work today though unfortunately

It doesn't work every single day but it's something I would look at before.

This was yesterday:

Wednesday:

I would target the close of the 9:34 or 9:35 (NY Time) candle. It won't always be so perfect but its a super low risk entry.

Won't go much more into it though as it's not on topic for nova lol

--- 帖子 #532 ---
I think it's pretty logical, especially if price moves away from the open quickly. You'll have plenty of liquidity around that area, and you'll definitely see an attempt to make it back there

Hmmmmm

Friday is never really that great because of the profit taking before the weekend.

What did you trade today because gold was actually pretty good especially the last 3 hours

Yellow lines are the 5M crossing zero level - 5m is in uptrend mode so when the cross actually happened you could have traded up with confidence you are in an uptrend on the 5m chart.

8 Wins. 1 loss and 1 break even.

Most recent trade is a win if you too the most recent pullback. If it was the low before it then it would be in drawdown right now.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
The first loss there I wouldn't have entered on that huge candle. I always like to be nearer to the last lower high.

The 2nd Loss you stop was too big. It should have been beneath that down candle near your entry and you would have won.

Nas is currently in a range so I am waiting on a break of the high or low before I jump in again.

I'm down 1R today on Nas. Wasn't there to set to BE :/

Hello friend, I hope you are well, I have a couple of doubts regarding your two entries today, in 1 and 2, how did you precipitate if the third bar was not yet met?

For the rest, have a great weekend and enjoy your new toy   trading in all house

I only trade EURUSD, it is a heavy stop hunter, add to the choppiness today: 12 trades, 2 winners.

I will try gold on Monday, have a great weekend, and yes, it is inspiring to see winners, inspiring to grasp the possibility of 2 or 3 or 10 percent a day, here and there.

I am more on the negative side of that list, with micros though, so worst loss is like 1 per 1000.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
EURUSD is a nasty pair to trade hence why they tell all beginners to use it.

I'm not sure how you like to trade but for me as soon as I take a loss I will literally mark the high and low that needs to break and wait.

I can guarantee if you post your losses I can explain why they lost.

Here is the london open for me... plenty room for profit.

The rest of the trades below:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

There is no way you should have 10 losses on EURUSD today.

You could say I am cherry picking but I'm not, I am just looking at the structure and also where the signal line is. It takes time anyways.

You will grasp it and I'll share as much as I can to help you all.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Can you explain a bit what are the reasons for the trades that he should take? And not the others signals?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
It's hard to explain because I have experience that allows me to take trades out of instinct (Chart Time)

The longer you are on the same instrument you get a feel for how it works.

I don't like taking trades that are too high or too low. To know this you need to use a higher TF and see how long its been in buy or sell mode for as eventually price has to reverse.

So therefore the best way to enter any positions is to wait for the higher TF nova to cross the zero level,

Check M1 chart for an EMA flip and then enter at least the first pullback away from the moving averages.

Like trendlines, we trade away from moving averages. If nova gives a signal and we're far from the moving averages then its not an A+ setup and so you need to be careful with it especially on low volume days.

If there was a checklist it would be:5M zero level change Go to M1, wait for EMA's to flip and price retrace back to the EMA area (just near it is fine) Wait for the first nova signal, it will usually be a softer move as its the first pullback so the entry shouldn't be after a huge candle. Win the trade 1:2 and follow up on additional nova signals but keep in mind the 5M nova will start losing volume momentum so be careful if the signal line is pulling back up towards 0 as there will be a loss coming if you keep hammering the M1. After a while you start to understand the instrument and what you can get away with.

I have never ever had 10 losses out of 12 using nova but the difference is I understand how the market moves and I won't jump into everything... my brain is conditioned to remember past trades now so I kinda feel the signals and whether it'll work.

I cant even see where 10 losses would occur if using the nova signals on the M1 today.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Is there no way to make some alert for when everything is tip top? And even then we should decide if we enter or not. It would be much easier, it's hard to watch M1 all day

--- 帖子 #544 ---
No mate, it's a manual system as proposed by OP. Anything like that would have to be done on your own time. Hire a coder and do the work yourself if you want it automated, but on this thread that isn't something that's wanted by the creator of the system so move on.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I'm not looking for full automation, I'm against EA's, just some alert when a possibility of a trade is there, that is all.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
There are alert functions. You just have to look lol.

The zero one might not be there on yours as I modified it when I asked if a zero level alert was wanted but at least check and see if the ones available work for you.

3rd bar histo alert is possible if you would like me to try and set that up. It's a little bit faffy and I don't want to make too many changes to what has worked for me personally.

However in the long term, manual is the best way. I show sometimes 20R in a day... the average joe only needs like 0.5R per day to be extremely profitable.

See here also:

I already set it to 0 level alerts.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I also explained it here on post 9 what the settings do from page 1

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Alot of my trading comes from instinct. The yellow line was me marking that the 0 level on M5 had crossed down & the MA's had flipped (which is bread and butter A+ setups for me as it's usually start of a new trend) on M1 so I knew it was time to sell.

My rules on here are for the majority to be able to get to grips with the system but I will take trades when I feel they will work out... that's why the system is subjective.

Someone 10 years profitable using the system would probably follow their own rules... I'm offering my system with rules for a beginner.

Chart time will allow you to take those kind of entries... big strong candles down from the MA's are something I'd enter without thinking about it.

I don't personally always look for nova to give me the signal now because I know it like the back of my hand.

Even if those entries were on 3rd histo bar, they still hit TP. I just don't really like entering positions that have a larger stop distance as they can sometimes gas out and then I have to endure pullbacks for it to hit TP.

Hope you have a great weekend too and ready for monday

Introducing the Nova Trading System, my go-to method that’s been quietly working wonders for me. Whether you’re new or seasoned, I believe you’ll find this system refreshingly simple and powerful. No fluff—just practical, actionable stuff.

Forget all the jargon: ICT, bearish/bullish breaker blocks, fair value gaps, order blocks, liquidity, etc. If you just trade the signals as they come, you’ll be fine. But let's keep it clean and easy.

What’s the Nova System All About?

The name's pretty straightforward. Future versions might even be called Super Nova, but let’s see how this goes first.

At its core, the Nova System revolves around precise entry and exit rules using volume strength, market structure, and clean signals. I’ve combined the best parts of different strategies into something that consistently works for me.

It’s adaptable—perfect for any market condition—and it fits my trading style.

But most importantly, you’ve got to make it work for YOU and your trading personality. If you're into volume and market structure, this could be the breakthrough you’re looking for.

Now, let’s talk about my journey: I struggled with the psychological side of trading for years, no matter what system I used. I found myself too emotionally attached to my trades in the early days, which held me back.

It’s taken me about 7 years to get my mindset straight, and I’m finally at a place where I feel 100% confident. So, I’m sharing this system for you guys to critique and improve on.

Currently, the system is available as an indicator on TradingView (still working on MT4, but it's a headache).

My Approach:

The key is clean charts, following the trend, and minimal indicators—maybe just one if you really need it. I’m going to break down the Buy and Sell Entry models for you.

If this sounds good so far, feel free to stick around. I’ll post live examples and setups soon. Let me know if you’re interested—I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.

RULES:

I won’t tolerate rudeness or negativity. This is a positive space to learn and share. If anything offends you, I’ll ban you—simple as that. We’re all adults, so let’s act like it.

This system works best if you have at least 2 years of chart experience. If you’re not into it, that’s fine—move along. But if you’re looking for a fresh perspective and willing to put in the work, stick with me.

Also, I won’t be sharing the source code of the indicator. It’s taken me 10 years to find something that works for me, and I’ve seen people take advantage of others’ work. But I’m happy to share the indicator so you can use it—no problem.

The Buy Entry Model Volume Kick-Off: Start by confirming volume with the Nova Volume Indicator. When you see a strong green bar cross above the 0 line, that’s momentum pushing in the buying direction. But don’t jump in yet—this is just your green light. Check EMA Angle: Now, check the trend with the EMA angle. If the EMA is sloping upward, you're in trend direction. If you're new, look for a slight upward tilt. Entry: Once the volume confirms with 1-2 green histogram bars and the EMA angle is confirmed, enter at the close of the candle (usually the second histogram bar). Simple. Set your stop just below the recent swing low, and aim for a 1:2 risk-to-reward. This isn’t about gambling; it’s about playing the odds.
The Sell Entry ModelVolume Confirmation (Bearish): Look for a red bar crossing below 0 on the Nova Volume Indicator—this signals selling pressure. EMA Slope Down: If the EMA is sloping downward, we’re in a downtrend, and the sell signal is valid. Entry: Enter at the close of the candle after volume confirmation. Place your stop above the recent swing high, aiming again for 1:2 risk-to-reward. Let it breathe and ride the momentum.

When the background is BLACK (dark mode) or WHITE (light mode), don’t trade. Wait for it to turn green (bullish) or red (bearish). With experience, you can take the first color change, but it’s subjective based on your style and experience.

The signal line will help keep you on the right side of the market, and you can use a multi-timeframe (MTF) approach: Check the 1-hour signal and drop down to a lower timeframe for entries, targeting that 1:2 profit.

In post 37 you hadnt even read the thread and knew nothing about nova, now you talk as if you created it. I dont believe you have the code and you are not the OP of the thread so cant ban anyone.

It is you that seems to be taking advantage of someone elses work by trying to hijack this thread.

Hi, does this work with tick or renko charts?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
8 trades, 6 losers, just cannot make it work for me.

The worst was Friday, 11 trades 10 losers.

Yes EURUSD is a bitch, all the algo power from the big boys at it.

So I figured, if I can crack it with Nova then It should work on almost everything.

Check these numbers:

EUR/USD is the most commonly traded currency pair in the foreign exchange market, with an average daily trading volume of close to $600 billion - equivalent to 37% of total market activity.

Anyway congrats . to all the successful Nova traders, in my humble, it takes following the original rules, plus some extra "pro experience" like some traders here prove to have.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
what TF are you using?

--- 帖子 #553 ---
11 trades sounds like a lot (IMHO) and there was a lot of red news.  If you take another look at Friday. There were 2 red news releases quite close together, so no trades until after the news.  Neither release moved the market much so, I'm happy that the market structure hasn't changed. ~10 minutes or so after the 2nd news release you get the first nova signal for a short.  Keep in mind time rotation (i.e. where am I in the 15 minute candle, and 1 hour candle) and by 0915 the day is done.  The rest of the days trades inside of this high and low, and it's a big range.

It's probably best to stop trading at this point or find another market.  A quick scan of Friday and I can see WTI looked to be setting up well for the US session i.e. price was trading down to a recent significant level (a swing low from Thursday), and formed a double bottom at the start of the US session.  I'm not suggesting you trade oil, but take a look at how this market was setting up for the US session, compared to EU.

Hi, do you use the rule that if 2 trades are losers on a unit u should wait? I had the same problem on my first day of trading this strategy btw, Since odds are good, the one starts forgetting that the main goal is not to lose, and the second one is to win, it helped me to stop opening shit trades to be honest, maybe that works for you too(I would be really happy tho).

PA in all its beauty. I feel satisfied when see this type of trades.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Morning/Afternoon all

Gold & Nas100 looking great!

Regarding losses, of course they're going to happen. But in reality you only need 1 good trade per day and each session gives you the first pullback entry towards the moving averages when they're flipping.

Focus on that set up FIRST if you're struggling.

Edit: I marked the wrong nova volume with the yellow circle. It could be where I marked but the main signal.would be after that pull back and then nova volume increased.

Will edit the image shortly

1 more trade, I pulled out at +1.5rrr so overall for today is 2.5rrr(doesn't sound amazing I know), but I missed 2 trades and I am still learning, I would say I do not even know a quarter of information of people on this thread. I was trying to find a place where I fit, and thank God I found it, it is trading. I am quite optimistic about my previous and further journeys mainly for 2 reasons. First of all, if I started doing it, I am mentally ready to succeed. Secondly, I honestly believe that by spending more time on learning theory and analysing markets(not exactly to open trades) you can optimise your learning time. I am still young so no need for money or luxurious stuff in my life. I fulfilled my main concern, I've found the thing I am truly passionate about. Thanks to all ff community and especially to people who contribute to this thread, because discovering this forum boosted my interest and made my journey more joyful(at least I am not alone anymore.)

--- 帖子 #560 ---
All you need to know is 1 setup that works 50% of the time and you will be set.

Try not to strategy hop as then you'll have too much information in your head and it'll slow down your progression.

Also, so enough backtesting if you have a setup you like and check every single scenario it appears and what time it appears too.

Be careful when news it going to be announced as it'll either make you overconfident if you catch one big win or you could blow your account if you risked too much. Usually better to stay out.

Focus on not risking more than 1% initially depending on your account size.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Thanks, no, I mean I am not that new, but thanks for telling, I would like to ask you about your previous setup, is it regular flip and bounce off?

Marvelous Job so far.... But you did not respond to proffer a solution to Vintex's encountered problem - Post#61: Am Gold/Oil focused trader with eyes on my currencies. So far I cannot get Nova Volume on my currency charts. Any advice Pease.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I've tried this strategy for the first time today from London session through to New York session. I focused mainly on trading Gold (XAU/USD) with some luck on BTC.

All of the trades I took were on the 1m timeframe but I've found trades to be more probable on the 5m chart. Also I would wait for the direction on the indicator to reset before looking for another entry. E.g I would look to enter within the first two candle on the Nova indicator with the EMA heading in the direction of my bias. If I can't enter within the first two candles of the indicator I will then wait for the indicator to reset, turn blank (white or black if you have dark mode) before looking to enter again. I noticed that this strategy works wonders with a heavily trending pair. Before you start, identify the trend and ride it all the way down/up.

I'm going to experiment more with this tomorrow alongside drawing out liquidity points and ranges to see where I should focus on taking these trades rather then only entering off a bearish EMA and a bearish indicator visual.

I entered 17 trades, winning 9 of them at a 2:1 ratio, exiting early on some if I saw weak buying/selling pressure.

Yes I entered way more trades than I should but I was pushing this strategy to it's limit seeing what works and what to look for.

My take away from today's session that this could be a very good scalping tool alongside a couple more confluences for consistency. I will be looking to continue testing everyday this week.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
The setup I posted was when the moving averages were about to flip for downtrend.

You usually get the large impulse move down (downtrend) and then price will pullback to usually retest the low it broke.

That is where I would enter my trade on the first nova signal with price above where there was a rejection of the last lower high... or above the 200EMA (up to you)

Then target 1:2 or trail it. I have been using heiken ashi candles recently so as soon as there's 2 opposite candles in a row or a close above the last down candle I'll look to exit.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
My apologies, I don't see everything.

It depends on the instrument & broker. Some data feeds you have to pay for so it might not show up on the chart.

Try selecting other instruments and see if it appears.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Oh, I see, I was also entering these kind of trades before, there was a gu he explained it in details in this thread. I thought you use something else or wait for some sort of additional confirmation.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Thanks, but there was no red news today according to FF European time.

Friday was full of news, I am extremely careful to keep a safe distance to the news events.I don´t trade news, neither "swappy" overnight.

Yes lots of trades, but each follows the basics, M1: EMAS pointing my way, shading of Nova, and volume spike. I reduced my TP to 1,5 and made it on 2 all the others were straight losers.There was one where I made a mistake, nobody is perfect, but pretty much every day I traded the system was a clear looser. Mind you, on EURUSD.

Btw. I am not a newbie, like I mentioned, it will be 30 years in about 18 months, about 15 in Forex. No big deal, I am taking the strategy as a test, never traded volume before, so I try to find a relation to the Big Boy´s algos with it.

In my humble, any system that works is because "somehow" it made it to follow the Algos accurately, say 50% of the time. That is the million-dollar formula.

I don´t want to be "destructive" , the creator of the system is an excellent trader, I can see that.But like the old turtle system, give it different people and some will just blow it one way or the other.

Anyway all the best to all.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Might want to swap your 50 ema to green and 100 ema to yellow haha, it's messing with my OCD.

The reason why I set those colours is because they are like traffic lights in the UK.

Green, good to go, yellow/orange be cautious and then red (red alert) haha.

nice idea btw, the more you cut ur energy spendings, the more your brain is going to stay fresh. I got in 3 mins ago, I hope it breaks support, wanna just hit 2r and close, don't have guts for now

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Backtest this setup (here)

Focus only on that setup when the EMA's flip and there is pullback and nova gives an entry.

I think because of your time in forex, you might have a lot of different ideas on entries because that's what I was like.

And the ones that work out I didn't enter.

Nova will also work best when the 5M is crossing 0 because then the bigger push will appear.

This is the 5m about to cross the zero level.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Go to the 1M chart and wait for the EMA's to be super think or about to flip and enter the first nova signals below 200 EMA.

The below are the entries just following nova. If you make the first entry 2R then it was still great.

I am just showing how I would look at it. I do prefer earlier entries, hate getting in after a big move.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Haha yes, always need to save on energy.

Gold looks like it wants to reverse at the moment for a short term up trend. Will have to wait and see though.

It's just broke the short term high.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
P stands for profit

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Banging! good work mate.

That's the pullback flip entry too although you entered earlier!!

Are you taking these live?

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I'm monitoring Gold & Nas and not found anything yet that I want to enter.

May take a long on gold but it is still downtrend.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I stop for today, now I go to read books know, cos if I don't learn something new, the day can cue considered as lost, also it helps me to relieve the pressure, so I don't want to overtrade.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
There was another entry on us30 tho, but I wouldn't enter as it gets nearer to 5m charts 200ema

--- 帖子 #578 ---
How much are you up today in terms of RR?

All you needed was 2R or even 1R per day to be profitable.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
for gold m1 there is a break of trend line and almost choch( idk maybe someone takes it as choch, I personally do not), and ema channels start to squeeze, so I guess there will be a flip and a real nice entrance on a pullback, anyways, see you tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
4 winners, 1 loser, overal: +6.6rrr

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Yes, and it is easy to get here, that's why this strategy is kinda dangerous for some type of personalities, lots of opportunities and win rate 2:1 or 1.5:1 so sometimes you take a trade without big picture or even enter by mistake, because the one sees 2rrr and high frequency, which sometimes can turn off ur brain, and after 3 loses in a row u usually not the same as you were, people have to consider this also imo.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
6.6RR - Perfect. Do that for 1 week and see where you are

Have a good evening!

--- 帖子 #583 ---
So I just took this one on gold but I ended up taking a bit less than I should have.

hello buddy

so for this :

Nova will also work best when the 5M is crossing 0 because then the bigger push will appear.

should we wait until its actually crossed 0 ?

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Do not think it's always great idea since you can get bad entry and it is not going to make till your TP. When it's EMAs' flip I can accept the lower volume and that the line has not crossed yet, since it's slightly different story imo.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
If you are in a downtrend and the 5M has pulled back and then it gives a bearish zero level cross mark it with a vertical horizontal line.

It doesn't have to be when it actually crosses but it gives you a heads up.

Then go to the 1M chart and wait for the first nova signal. Sometimes there is a nova signal when the 5M is about to cross zero and you can enter on that signal but I would usually wait for a pullback so I'm not getting a fakeout.

5M signal crossing 0 is just saying its sell mode to enter on the 1M nova signals.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Go to 1M and take nova signals.

So Imagine when H1 gives a 0 level cross and you dial down to the 1M nova.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
H1 Nova crossing 0 level.

Nova 1M chart

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This is just the idea of using higher TF zero crosses.

H4 would be even crazier but then you have to remember the pullbacks will be bigger so I use M15 or M5 before I continue.

You just need to remember where you are on the higher TF zero level crosses.

You want to match the HTF nova cross with the 1M nova crossing zero to be in with the momentum.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Currently waiting for Nas to break out of this little range and then I will take entry on the first nova signal.

Hi xkwisit2001,

I'm following your thread since the very beginning - only as a "silent" reader so far.

First of all I want to say thank you for sharing the NOVA Indicator and giving something back to the community - it is highly appreciated and I think I can speak for many people following this thread.

I would consider myself as a trader with a certain level of experience, but of course still and forever always learning new things! :-)

I backtested your system for a while now.

My approach was studying all of your charts and tried to imagine what your idea was when you took a trade - or also when you didn't.

So long story short, after studying all of it over and over again, my confidence increased, getting to know where the A+ Setups are and when to better stay out of business.

I went live with a small real account, here's my result for today, trading 4,5 hours:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Maybe this will be an inspiration for others!

And here are the trades I took in Gold:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Started with a loser, then found the entry into the short trend and followed it.

I always take M5 as confirmation as you suggest.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The two trades marked with "BE" I set breakeven +1 after reaching 1 R, so that were two free trades.

After I made my money for the day, with the last trade I thought either it will consolidate back to the EMA 200, OR it might go down to the next Pivot Point (purple line in the chart).

So I decided to trail it, and got stopped out at +1,5 R, which is fine.

That trade would have been good for 7 R though, but don't get greedy! ;-)

If you find some time, I would be very glad if you could take a look at my entries and the trade management, and maybe give me your opinion about it! :-)

Btw, for EMA's I'm using an Indicator that shows also the angle of the EMA's with a predicition into the future.

Here's the Link: https://de.tradingview.com/script/GG...Visible-ANGLE/

Maybe it is helpful for anyone, it helps to see where we are with the EMA's, and especially where it is heading to.

I will try and contribute to this thread actively from now on whenever I can! :-)

Thanks again for your great efforts, xkwisit2001! :-)

hello bud

please see image so in this example so when you look at 5min bar chart bias would you class this as an uptrend and then when you take entry on the 1min bar chart you would only look for long nova signals?

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hello,

First, thanks for the indicator. I would like to confirm with an example if I have understood it correctly to open an operation.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I would not enter in the first two arrows as the signal is not crossing 0, it is in the negative zone.

I should enter in the next arrows as the signal line is crossing 0 and then I get the red zone and red line in the histogram.

Is it correct?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I use this Heiken Ashi, it can be easily turned off with a button. It's for the MT4 platform.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
great advice as always bud !!!

so much respect to you and a number of other great contributors on this thread as i know this was never really meant as a teaching thread so i for one am so grateful to date

--- 帖子 #596 ---
hi on this example you posted, would i be wrong in thinking this can be seen as a pull back on the uptrend? (see my blue lines)

thanks

--- 帖子 #597 ---
You're getting it... those first 2 BE shouldn't be BE as price didn't take out the lower highs but thats why you need to test and gain confidence.

If you take every suitable trade with no emotion you will make profit. It's only emotion that stops you.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Once the 5M goes below the zero level I will dial down to the 1M chart and take nova signals.

I will still look at the higher TF i.e 15m/H1 too just to see if its down too. If not, I'll wait and see what's going to happen as reversal could be coming.

I always follow HTF trend.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
I like to enter on the 3rd bearish histogram bar at the open if possible. If the bars are large then I won't take the trade as it's likely it'll make my stop loss too large to get a 1:2.

I try to get entry when the moving averages flip as that is usually the best setup for guaranteed profit or break even at least.

Once you build up profit from one of those entries it makes things easier.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
On this, if you check the 5M it was most likely above the zero level so I wouldn't have taken any sells.

Once 5M is down i'll wait for a retracement on the M1 and then enter the first nova signal.

If you do this constantly you will get the best RR trades.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Heiken ashi helps a lot because it keeps you in the trend. As soon as I see 2 opposite candles I'll get out.

Only if i'm at 1:2 though

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Yeah, it really is a nice indicator I came about even before this thread.

For me I mainly use it to smooth things out a bit, just like xkwisit mentioned with HA-candles, similar effect.

And thank you, I always appreciate your insights too! :-)

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Thanks for your quick reply and feedback!

You're right, I should have given the trades a bit more room to breathe.

Like that the second trade would have been a solid 1:2 RR winner, and the first one BE then imo.

And yeah, it's all about emotions.

I'm still at the point where I'm building confidence to my own interpretation of "good" signals, or A+ setups.

So at this point I tend to move to BE fairly quickly before taking a loss, but with growing confidence the performance will improve, I'm sure! :-)

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hey OP, I’ve been following this thread closely over the last few days, first off thank you so much for the very detailed thread and giving back to the community.

I have just 1 question when do you decide on a direction to trade on the 1 minute is it when it’s inline with the 1H or 5m? Can you take us through the process of you coming up with your bias for the day? And also what are the best sessions to trade in your experience with gold?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
The best way is to check say the 15M/1HR and see what the trend is.

Then check nova and see if it has recently crossed the zero level in the trend direction. If it has then you can go down to say the 5M and wait for that to cross the zero level in the trend direction and that way you know you are in with the main trend.

Ideally you want all timeframes to agree on the direction but of course some will be opposite during a pullback so it's just all about aligning the Nova signals with the trends.

If 1HR is just crossing the zero level then you will be able to have more successful trades with nova on the lower time frames as you have the bigger ones backing you up.

That's why you can see some crazy trades if say the 4HR or Daily are crossing zero level.

I like to jump into the NY open for Gold/Nas100. London session is ok... but just a bit more slow.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Here is a reason why you should hold trades. I broke my emotion rule and actually closed the trade with a tiny profit because I didn't like the strong pullback. Only for it to reverse and hit TP.

Oh well, there will be more entries around the corner.

M5 hit the zero line.  Entered after the engulfing bar on the new 15 minute rotation.  1 tp at 1:2 , one trailed the 1 minute for a little over 1:2 and the 3rd hit breakeven. I thought this was a short to a significant low (but not this one).

1R loss for me, I don't like those large candle entries but I'm up 7R overall

As you can see with the push down before my entry those large candles tend to retrace after. Gradual volume is the best with smaller bars i.e half the size of that big one.

Will wait for a break of the low that I entered on and take nova signals after that.

Bit weary this could turn bullish again though.

It’s the “Linear Regression Channel”.

is anyone taking advantage of the Trading View Black Friday sale on subscriptions?

Hi! I'm new over here but i've started trading a couple years ago.

I've been using for a while the DR/IDR strategy (you can find how it works on the mas7er YT channel) mixed with ICT concepts and a "cloud" indicator based on the 21 EMA and a derivated EMA with a 8 periods EMA, 14 periods DEMA and a 100 periods EMA. Basically the strategy works like this: If the price breaks the DR range, the cloud is in favour and it leaves an FVG, i can trade.

So, i've been backtesting my strategy with the nova indicator and it is awesome because it's another confirmation that i can use.

I think you've given us something really useful, thanks a lot.

Here you have some examples of how i'm applying the strategy:

Before and after. I think all speaks for itself. I identify levels by myself and love to see volume spike into them. Usually nice bounce follows.

However, this one was just regular, trend change/break out following trade.

Very good observation. I mentioned this a fair few pages ago and defo noticed price reverses these big volume spikes.

It's almost like a liquidity run without taking any liquidity as such. Mark out the -200 and +200 levels on the 1M chart nova and you'll see lots of them appear.

Could be a cool entry system

Hope the charts treating you well bud!

Gold London Open.  Long (hour plus) consolidation.  Triple bottom to the low of the consolidation. Nova all green.  A better entry (or at least another if you missed the first) a few bars later on the pullback.

How is it possible to take 1m trades on the flip so quickly (price going from above the 200ma to below or vice versa) if we need to wait for higher time frame confirmation?

Also with the higher time frame confirmation are we looking for supportive histogram bars only or do we need the background colour along with the bar?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Gold is in break out from yesterday's high. 3 dumps from the high of today prior major red news at 1330 UK / 0830 NY.  The news doesn't do anything (more red news later).  We get a rising flag/pennant with signals from nova.

Failed:  Thought this was a short setup following the news.   Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I'd like to see this strike move without any hesitation or pullback, so got out for a small loss.  It may continue but the decision was to preserve my capital.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
M15 is the best TF for intraday trading so following the trend we can see price broke above the red line and attempted to break the next structural low (turned into resistance) which it failed to do.

Although on the 4HR it is still a downtrend, so intra day I will look at the M15 levels.

Using a fib from the low that broke the RED high price has pulled back to the 70.5 level on the fib and is basically consolidating (waiting for Asia most likely)

I have marked the possible scenarios that I am looking at.

Price could break the high or low and then pullback to a fib level if momentum isn't there (in yellow).

If there is momentum then it could just break and retest (in red).

We'll see what happens from here

hello everyone,

I have a question, is there a good working ai trader for MetaTrader 5? The best would be one where you can use the nova volume indicator because I have been looking for a good ai for months but I can't find the right one. So if you can help me, i would appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Why all the apostrophes for plurals?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I have seen in your example that in some possible operations the 50EMA was flat or sloping against the operation.

According to your experience, what is more important? the sloping of 50EMA in the operation direction or the distance among the three EMAs mantaining the slope in the operation direction?

--- 帖子 #644 ---
What do u think of Robb hoffman overlay sett indicator on TV for this strat? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
My other question is how to put audible alert when there is a signal in the histogram. I have not seen any configuration option in the indicator.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Regarding your first question: I like to see price pushing up or down away from the 50EMA with volume and then I will look for nova signals on each pullback.

If the trend has just started then you will see all the EMA's fan out with a similar distance between them. I don't like when all EMA's are very close to each other as price tends to range.

See here post 550 for alerts.

It will alert when price crosses the zero line bullish or bearish.

Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening guys

I am going to share something that I am considering doing. Over the past few years I have always pretty much had the same days where I can take profit and come back again tomorrow.

However, I am feeling that I might get more out of my system with less entries and stress if I start following the monthly pivot levels and pretty much swing trade from the M1.

You can also do this using the Weekly Pivot levels which also work great!

Here is the plan, use the monthly pivot levels and trade nova in the direction of the trend away from the pivot level.

This is an example for this week from the 24th:

13 hour ish trade from entry to TP

See the annotations

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Then the target would be the next Monthly S38 pivot level below which hit with 13 hours.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

STRESS FREE Trading and only 1 or 2 entries max.

Yes sometimes price can come back to the pivot level but then you just set to break even and only focus on entering from the pivot with nova as its the best place to enter.

Attached is the pivot indicator for MT4

Sometimes the MT4 Monthly Pivots don't match the TV version - I personally would use the TV pivots and mark them on MT4 if this is the case.

Click this for the pivot indicator on TV

Note: for the TV indicator You need to type in either Daily, Weekly, Monthly in the settings to change them.

Also, the monthly doesn't show on the 1M chart so it is a good idea to mark each pivot with a ray line and lock it on the chart. This helps if you don't have TV subscription as well because you can then remove the pivot indicator.

This for me could be a gamechanger as it'll make my average R:R insane & I won't have to monitor the charts all the time.

All I will need to do now is set alerts at the pivot levels and then jump on my computer when needed.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Great idea, planing to implement it in my system and give it a go using weekly pivot points(tho I like scalping and I won't stop doing it). The only question remaining is when to move stop loss to break even?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I love scalping but imagine having 6 bullets, using the weekly/monthly pivots to initiate trades away from them once nova confirms means you have a much bigger potential to take 1 trade stress free. I am at my computer quite a lot and I can often end the day with 2 - 6R depending on if I sit and trade throughout.

But this will give me way more time and hitting 30R even in 1 week is actually insane.

I would set to break even at a 1:1 or something... will test this out. Depends on the trend (emas). If I get stopped out at BE ill then wait for another entry and try the same thing again.

If taking these trades on the 1HR you'll be waiting all week just to get 1:2 or 1:3 which is why I scalp the 1M but I am really liking the prospect of using the 1M chart to trade away from the pivot points now.

Also, you can change the pivots to daily and trade them daily instead

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Can you make a daily pivot point example?

--- 帖子 #651 ---
I see, we gotta test this out and come with proper trading plan instead of just an idea, and then you can create new trading strategy called "Super Nova"

--- 帖子 #652 ---
This would be a good daily pivot example for today

15R this would be from the 2nd nova signal above the pivot.

The first nova signal was a 5R trade.

I marked it on the chart below.

The pivot levels give you a good place to TP.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Sounds interesting.  I've done something similar: use the H/L/C of the previous week and month as targets.  So if I'm coming off of one of these levels and the higher timeframe trend supports it, I'll leave some of my position on (about a 1/2 to 1/3 sometime less), and target a bigger move.  Locking in some of a position is psychologically good (for me at least), I'll then move the stops to break even.  One challenge is that the higher timeframes also go through periods of chop, so you can get a whole weeks and months of ranging and hitting the stops.  If you're holding overnight, the spread during the rollover can be a bugger too!

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Of course, I will make an update once I have forward tested properly.

Just thought to let you guys know what I am looking at.

The original nova system is perfectly fine and we should keep on that topic always.

But for those who have a job or can't be on charts all day using the pivots is a good option.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
The opportunity to scale in with multiple entries could be an option too.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Remember it's thanksgiving today so I am not trading till monday

Have a great day for those that celebrate it.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
I use IC Markets raw spread account so it is perfect but yes 100% good idea to take some off and let it run.

There are loads of early nova entries that end up hitting a pivot level so can work well.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
When price looks like this DO NOT trade it.

Just mark your highs and lows and wait for a break... but yeah I am staying out today for sure.

But below you can see that if you managed to get an entry from the central daily pivot it would have been the best entry and you wouldn't have to endure this choppiness.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I've only been using this for a short time but it seems very helpful (with the caveat that you still need to know the basics of PA and market structure).  Looking back over the week so far I've managed to grab a couple of decent trades each day on the M1 using Nova as an indicator that the move should have some weight behind it. I've closed a few more out early with at breakeven or with a small profit or loss.  Some of these would have gone on to hit the 1:2 target but some wouldn't and I will close out positions if they don't move or start to come back with pace (I like to preserve my capital).

I'm looking for constant improvement and do a weekly review of trades taken. Monday was a fantastic opportunity on gold.

Coming into Monday, Gold was in a solid trend (5 days long).
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The H1 is useful for clearly seeing significant highs and lows.  As you can see last week Gold was in a solid trend, with the only significant pullback coming on Wednesday.  There is another pullback on Friday, before the uptrend continues.  Monday morning sees a (brutal) sell off taking out Friday's longs and we get a break in structure. This is followed by a pullback to the breakout level, taking the stops of breakout traders.  In the NY session we get leg 2 of the sell off (these tend to come in 3's).

Dropping down to the M1 for entry (there were longs on the counter for London traders). Coming into the NYO the EMAs compress, and we get a triple top back into the breakout traders from the Asian session. The red vertical is 2pm UK (0900 US) and the market took off.  Those 3 peaks would be drawing in more longs and at 0900 US the market took them out, then went on to take out Thursday's longs and Wednesday's longs.  Nova gave short signals for a while, as the EMA's rolled over and we had a breakout short on the hour rotation.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When the market takes off like this, it can go without stopping for 45 minutes to an hour.  In this case, trailing the highs of the minute could have captured a 1:12 in about 20 minutes.  Alternatively (and I've only just started to look at this and some testing is needed) use the Nova pullbacks as a place to move stops.  With some sensible trade management, some of the initial position could be left to take out the stops of Wednesday's long traders.  This is easy with hindsight, and you can never be sure how a trade will play out, but once the price started to break down in the NY session, it was likely to start taking out stops from long traders.

If I could have liked this twice I would have. Very informative and helpful so thank you for doing that as it will help people here.

That's right, I actually like to lose sometimes just so I don't ruin my psychology.

But I know what I will get from my system so the losses will come whether I like it or not.

Imagine winning 5 in a row and then doubling up on the next trade because of sheer greed. Just not worth it.

Wishing you better success next week.

Thin market so smaller positions but looks like a good session setup on gold for a scalp. 3 small positions. 1 at 1.5 RR, the second at 1:2 and 3rd just below the high of day.

Yesterday was an inside day (EDIT: no it wasn't!!), and in the AO both yesterday's high and Wednesday's highs have been hit. There was a short (possibly 2) setups but nothing 'clean' where I could place a stop nearby. Around 9 (UK) we get some chop after price comes back into highs from Wednesday and sweeps a significant low from the AO, and a triple bottom is formed, with a break in structure. The pullbacks give another diagonal (not sure how else to describe it) triple bottom, an engulfing candle. The pullback with a pinbar, 2 or 3 solid green bars from Nova, and entry as the next bar opens.

Note: First 2 TPs hit, and the 3rd hit at around 1:1.5 after adjusting the stop.

Gold long.

Price has broken out of Friday's range, and looks to be trading back up.  It could be a failed breakout (in which case we could see price go a lot higher), or a retest of the low (and a continuation short).

Nice setup in terms of PA and EMA's but due to the proximity of Friday's low, I used smaller sizing.  The Neckline refers to the reverse head and shoulders, and it is the breakout of this, with the stong green nova bars which act as the trigger.

Quick update:

I'm new to trading, still figuring stuff out but I tried the Nova on a demo account last night and managed to sneak in a few shorts.

03.12.24: 10 trades. 6 Wins, 4 Loses

Pairing the Nova indicator with what I've learnt about market structure. Main analysis/daily bias on the 1H, 5M for confluence reaction, 1M for entries using the 3EMA and Nova. Took shorts all the way down to the MSS then called it a night (NYO).

I'm still learning so any feedback would be good!

I have used during some days the nova volume indicator. I think that it is a very good indicator to use in trending markets with a good market analysis to decide where doing an operation or not. It is not working just by itself.

The point that is getting me a bit confused is the length of the histogram. I would like to understand what is causing the length of the histogram bars, is it calculated with the volume, delta, candle lenght,...? Sometimes I see similar candle movements with a short histogram bars and other times bars are so long that finish out of the screen.

I woul like to understand better how it is calculated to decide better if this is a good oportunity to trade.

Thanks in advance.

Hey guys, apologies for my absence the past few days. Had so much going on that kept me off the charts.

Absolutely. There were good trades across several markets yesterday. The US small caps (R20000) are breaking down this week and we on my radar. Yesterday gave a great short opportunity into the new hour after the markets opened.

Price was below the previous close, gave a break in structure at the market open, reversed and put in a head and shoulders at the start of the new hour, followed by the pinbar. Nova gives entry (confluence with PA and timing), and kept me in the trade for 30-45 minutes.

RR ~1:5.

Gold - market structure long.  We get a high put in at the end of the London session and a pullback of around 0-70 pips over the next 2 hours. There is a reverse head and shoulder pattern and at 1330 (UK) the neckline is broken and Nova lights up green. Most of the position is off at 1:2+.  Something to watch for, last weeks candle was an inside week and so we could see some explosive moves this week.

Excuse the squashed chart, but this demonstrates how well this indi works across markets.  As someone else mentioned in the thread it's about the right market conditions.  In this case, the right conditions take a few days to set up.

A great setup yesterday on the SP500. Friday was an outside day, so Thursday's long and short stops were hit. This leaves a kind of vacuum and signals a possible breakout. Price ranges all day, and after we get the move on the rotation to a new hour after equity open. The usual Nova entry criteria are met around 15 minutes into the new hour for an easy 1:5+ in about an hour.   Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I don't think you could trade this (or any) indicator without supporting analysis.

Gold - daily structure is long.  We get a pullback coming into the US session a small double bottom and a continuation. Very tight stop and most of the position closed out at 1:2 with a small trailer left in with a target around the 2690 level.

I've never been very good at trading oil but this worked out well. The overall structure is long (there have been a few short days and yesterday was the first daily higher high). So with a long bias and knowing the oil markets start to pick up sometime after 1300 (UK), there is a clear dumping pattern, which signals a possible long. Nova lights up, the EMA's split for a perfect entry.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
No issues with IC Markets as long as you have the correct details. I did have some teething issues at the start but it was due to being a new customer and they asked for some extra documents.

Some people tend to sign up to get trading immediately and then forget to complete stuff lol

Although I have shared my system, the success if also based on your understanding of the market.

Market structure is is crucial for it to work, you need to know when the market is ranging and stay out and then execute once the trend starts which I've shared my favourite style of setup in previous pages. (First pullback after the EMA's flip on the lower timeframe in the direction of the higher timeframe overall trend).

The first entry is the highest probability & that usually acts as my buffer for the day in case I get any losses but Nova has been great for me and others here using it have managed to work it out too.

One thing to note, it's always best to move stops to break even when at a 1:1.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Surely most have had success this week with this trend on gold?

Last 2 weeks were ranging horribly but has been much better this week!

Some tips with gold though: When london opens and we are in an uptrend price will tend to sweep the high and then the low of the asian session. Most times it'll only sweep the low before continuing up. When new york opens in the same trend it very likely will sweep the london session high, then low and back up again with news. How I like to look at it, if price is due to make a pullback I will wait for a sweep of the highs and for change of character before taking any counter trend trades.

Nova also works best on the 1M when your HTF Nova is crossing 0 in the direction of the overall trend.

Hope what I am saying is making sense

Have had a new addition to the family so I have been so tired and I've been coming onto the charts feeling like this >

Hope you're all well!

Did you select it to alert every time in the 'Create Alert' option?

You will need to select 1 for bullish and 1 for bearish though but this will work great if you set it for your HTF i.e M5/M15/H1.

Just helps you to know when it's go time to start looking for entries on the LTF (M1).

I think it's just default Nova (xkwisit has changed a few colours from default), and an EMA ribbon. 50, 100, 200 from memory but any short, medium, long combination should be fine.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Congrats

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Would it be possible to get alerts when the line crosses 0 when also when its the correct bullish/bearish momentum color change?

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Thanks bud!

--- 帖子 #729 ---
I am going to be launching an update for the indicator so I will add that also.

So do you mean when the background changes colour from black and then there is a bar in line with the signal line?

If it includes the signal line then you will miss trades though as quite often the signal line is curving up and hasn't crossed and will cross on the next histogram volume bar to print.

Good news though, I have incorporated the moving averages on chart and also the pivot dots on the chart to show market structure for the new update so it will be more of an all in one indicator for those who don't have a tradingview subscription.

Great work!

I just got into this on NAS100

Aiming for 3R and will take some off and let it run.

Perfect power of 3 play as price was ranging, manipulated down and then as soon as price closed back into the range I got in.

Didn't exactly follow nova as it was something I knew was coming though

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Update to last post:

TP was hit nicely

There were also nova entries when the EMA's flipped.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
When the yellow line crosses 0 on the first bar when the background changes color. I noticed this are the most powerfull signals.

All good winners. I marked them with blue on nova.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Excited to hear that there might be an update upcoming!

If you are in the updating process currently, I‘d have another suggestion for an additional feature: Since many of us follow your HTF approach, would it be possible to add an option that allows changing the timeframe?

So for example while watching the M1 chart you could add another NOVA indicator above/below, that displays the signal line of M15 for example. Split screen does the job as well of course, and I don’t know how much of an effort it would be to add that (maybe it’s even already possible but I just don’t know how?).

But maybe it is easy to add and you find it worth considering as well!

Thanks for your efforts as always, it’s really highly appreciated what you are doing here!  Oh, and of course congrats to your new family member as well from my side!

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Oh yeah, I can do that. It will be in the next update which will be a big one so keep any suggestions coming as I'll try and get as much implemented as possible.

The first bar can be the best entry but the issue is that sometimes there will be a big bar fake out and i'll reverse.

If you scour the charts for any moves that hit +200 or -200 they most times tend to pullback hard but that can be an entry method... to enter maybe on 50% of the last big bar to eliminate that happening.

However, if it works for you and you end up making way more R:R then the losses are just the cost of playing.

You'll work it out over time what works best for you but in the meantime I'll get onto that and have an update soon.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
So you want an option to see the HTF nova on the M1?

That could would work well as you'll find the best nova entries are when the 5M background colour changes in line with the trend.

Only difference is that the best entry will usually be on the M1 buttt using the HTF will eliminate losses also.

I've taken note and will let you know over the weekend how what I'll be adding to the next version.

As long as it's helping you guys and working for you, I'm happy to make modifications.

I have so many different versions of nova on my side but this is the one I use for simplicity.

You may also have a play around with nova settings as it is possible to modify the current nova version to show the signals faster or slower.

The current settings are balanced.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Thank you. Alerts for this will make it much easier. Also you can't just enter blindly when nova says so we all know that

--- 帖子 #739 ---
I should have rephrased it, if there is a strong trend you can often still come out profitable lol

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Thank you!! :-)

And yes, that is exactly what I meant. Actually the same like having open M1 and M5/15 charts with NOVA on both of them, showed split screen next to each other. That’s my current setup.

But for better visualization it might be more efficient to only have the M1 chart open, but with several NOVAs calculated on higher timeframes. Wouldn’t replace the check of market structure on HTF of course, but if you monitor several assets it’s helpful for quickly browsing through.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I think the option to set the time frame according to the chart (default) or manually would fix it. So you would then have 2 instances of nova running. One according to the chart time frame and then a second panel set to what ever higher time frame you want. That way you coule have 3 or more running if you wanted. Hopefully that will work for XK

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Exactly!

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I do like gaps in the market. Below shows USDCHF and a gap from a couple of weeks ago that has just been filled.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On the H1 Nova gives an excellent indication of trending vs ranging.  The gap gives something to aim at.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
SP500 - D1 lower low, H4 high breakout and fail (maybe a sweep?). Not quite to the rules but I guess we could consider it an aggressive entry. As soon as price comes back below the 200 and back inside of the H4 high. THe pullback give another entry.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

UPDATE: 2 days to set up and the main move takes about an hour, targeting the stops of long, higher time-frame traders who put there stops at the low of the previous day and the low of the day 2 days ago.

Was having a little play around with something that Lubedaddy mentioned about the background change on Nova M5.

If following structure and price is bullish on the HTF, If you start marking the background colour change on the M5 with a vertical line and enter with stops at the recent low you can get some really good returns.

I am using an indicator to show the market structure in the image but targeting the major swings which are the blue dots as take profit you can see its extremely profitable.

There were many many other entries on the M1 but I think the M5 entries could be much better if you are happy to hold trades a bit longer.

Take a looky

NOTE: the 3rd trade was a trade I took today as was up with baby. I didn't take any of the others and I TP a bit earlier than on the chart below but it eventually hit.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
UPDATE: I will be looking to implement the following things over the weekend.

Background Color Change Alerts

Alerts triggered when the background changes between bullish (green), bearish (red), or neutral (black). It'll then be able to notify you of any momentum changes in real-time without needing to watch the charts constantly.

Dashboard for Multi-Timeframe Status

A dashboard displayed in the corner of the chart showing Nova's status (bullish, bearish, neutral) across multiple timeframes (M1, M5, M15,H1, H4 etc...)

Multi-Timeframe Functionality

Ability to select a higher timeframe (HTF) for Nova's analysis while trading on a lower timeframe (i.e see 5M Nova on the 1M chart). That way you can align lower timeframe trades with higher timeframe momentum and trend. So will add a dropdown in settings to choose the desired HTF.

This one may be a bit of weird one to implement because the volume bars will look weird as 5M nova on a 1M chart will be stretched to fit across the 5 1 minute bars.

Maybe the dashboard will be better?

I think these things will be extremely helpful

--- 帖子 #747 ---
What is the Indicator you are using to show Market structure please?

Thanks for sharing the system.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
It's called Major Minor Fib Points - HERE

It'll show blue dots for major swing points and then the purple colour for the minor ones.

I will also implement that in the Nova indicator update as well as the EMA's.

Got a lot of work to do but it'll be worth it when done so everything will be in a single indicator.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
One tip.

If nova issues an entry signal and its off a big candle - enter at the 50% of that big candle as it'll often pull back on the next candle unless it's a news move.

My 3rd bar entry would have been the best entry anyway but it's just a good way to know a nice area to enter.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
That's great. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Great stuff, xkwisit2001!!

A dashboard would be awesome and is more than I was expecting would be even possible to implement - already very excited to see the new version!

And I know what you mean with the stretched bars of HTF NOVA. I would still find it very useful (maybe only using the next higher timeframe then), and if it would be too confusing one could still only show the signal to display the momentum of HTF.

But as mentioned, dashboard would be absolutely amazing, and I think both additions (HTF-Option AND dashboard) would have their right to exist!

Hope you enjoy the time with the baby and your nights are not too short, bud!

--- 帖子 #752 ---
That’s what I try to do too - using NOVA as direction/signal and then use market basics to time the entry.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I'll try both and see how it turns out but the dashboard will definitely be added. As soon as it goes from neutral to bullish it'll then alert you and you can jump in.

Thank you and I think the early mornings will be a blessing in disguise as I can get more done in the day

The black/white background is the neutral zone and its more based on some thresholds I've set but you'll find it'll turn colour in line with market structure breaks at times.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Sounds really promising!

And I agree, the early bird catches the worm

Nova NAS100 H4 - Nice trades entering on bar close of colour change.

Non trade if signal is below the 0 level.

Of course during ranging periods stay out!

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Hi everyone,

I am now trying out this strategy since it looked really promising.

What do you guys think fo this setup for EURUSD. Entry on the 1 minute from a pivot level targeting the first next support pivot level.

It's targeting a 1:38RR.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
It'll be in the new Nova update I release this week

--- 帖子 #760 ---
alright thank you bro

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Will this indicator also come for mt4/5?

--- 帖子 #762 ---
my only problem about this strategy is calculating lot size, sometimes the candle just go fast and im still calculating my lot size

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Very simple trading. Good stuff. Looking forward to the updates. I like to use this as confluence on the 1m trading crypto. Keeps me out of false break outs as well as keeps me in the trend a little longer to just breakeven if the trade is not necessarily going in my direction.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I recommend using an MT4 expert called Position Sizer.

You can download it here for free: https://www.earnforex.com/metatrader...osition-Sizer/

You can select the preferred position size per trade (i.e. 1 % of your account), and the expert calculates the lotsize automatically for you. You can also set a fixed TP (i.e. 2R), and then you just need to drag a line to the stop level of your trade, the rest happens automated. Hope this helps! :-)

You are awesome thank you

Just working on the dashboard which has been a pain in the ass but love seeing everyone enjoying the indicator in its current form.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
what news do we need to avoid using this system?

--- 帖子 #775 ---
This is crazy to combine with Elliot wave analysis! I see my entries on the chart without indicators, but this indicator also has triggers at the same places where I see my entries. Also, I don't always see my entries so the indicator could be telling you, 'there is indeed a set up'.

I also like that you say market structure and volume are the most important things. I agree, I have always seen it in that way too. For market structure, I reduce everything to the Elliot wave theorie if possible, since I believe everything can be reduced to it. HTF/LTF symmetry is amazing with it.

How can I thank you?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
yes good combination with market structure just a basic high and low + pa identify some rejection and possible direction in htf not only go for entry blindly

Lower timeframes... 4HR is best to avoid news

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Yeah it works very well with EW. I think the the best term for volume & market structure is just 'Order Flow'. Moving from liquidity to liquidity but understanding where the volume comes from and why.

As I mentioned much earlier, if you trade gold futures and pay for the COMEX data feed on tradingview you will get access to the real volume data which Nova will work precisely with.

Also just being profitable with the indicator is the best thanks

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Didn't like much of what I saw today.  USDCAD played out about as anticipated.  USDCAD has been on a long run but started to break down yesterday.  The ascending triangle leading up to the new hour was probably a trap for longs to re-enter.  It may go further but didn't seem to be going anywhere after 45 minutes so closed out for the day.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
I'm not sure what I didn't like about the Gold setups today, but it would have been a decent long trade.  Plenty of entries after the news.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
The way you are trading and your understanding is very well so I hope Nova has helped with your profitability. You pick some good setups!

I was just posting the setups for gold today which were good but you beat me to it aha

--- 帖子 #783 ---
If you trade on the 1 minute, what timeframe would you normally base your higher timeframe confirmation on?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Intraday it would be like this: M15 - M5 - M1

You could do M15 & M5 but I use M1 for better entries & R:R if I'm going for more than a 1:2.

I still will mainly keep an eye on what the H4 and daily is doing though as sometimes you can be in a daily/H4 pullback so you need to know where you are in the main trend.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Hi guys, just started looking at Nova. I trade the 1 min charts and wondered what the best settings for this time frame might be.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Hi guys, will you trade this week? It's xmas, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #787 ---
oof, I only trade nasdaq, but thanks for the tip! Also, what I noticed with the indicator is that with a trendreversal, the collor would not immediatly switch from red to green. it will cross the zero line with momentum. But it doesn't mean you shouldn't trade it, it is just lagging with big reversals, for the collor part. But if you know your position in the cycle, you can trade it based on momentum switch!

I have also lots of respect you can make a indicator like this.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
I see the COMEX feed has a 10 minute delay wouldn't this make it non correct for 1minute scalping or am I seeing this wrong?

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hi, i've been practicing the nova volume indicator and this is a really good one. Is there any possibilities to have the source code ? i would like to code a scalp system by combining this one with another indicator on tradingview.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
It depends what timeframes work for you.

It goes like this for me:

Daily Structure - 4HR area of interest - 1HR Entry

4HR Structure - 1HR area of interest - 15M Entry

1HR Structure - 15M area of interest - 5M Entry

15M Structure - 5M area of interest - 1M Ent <<<---- This is what I tend to do but I still follow the 4HR structure for bigger R:R when the TF's align

I appreciate it, you are definitely understanding how it works as that's how I coded it.

Reversals are best on the M1 following an even bigger TF like the 4HR so that way you can ride some crazy trends.

What I show as entries aren't always what I trade. I have a few swing trades that I keep open for the longer term and then daily I'll take a few smaller ones.

I like to hit 1:10's + ideally but I trade low risk and not 1% like the ICT crew tell you to.

Just something that helps pay the bills long term in case I get intraday losses.

You need to pay for the COMEX feed on tradingview so it's not delayed or trade with a futures broker on there.

Sorry, no source code available otherwise it would be open source

Been here and trading for a while and seen very good peoples work on here get stolen from them for a quick payday.

I've had a lot of people ask for the source code on here or want to pay me especially on tradingview.

It's a wild greedy world out there.

DO NOT TRADE THIS WEEK LOL

I've done it before and it doesn't end well.

If you really have to then use much lower risk.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I hope you all in this period take time to backtest this system or with your own and come back in Jan with a clear plan.

Many people even with Nova still struggle and the most common reason is mindset/psyche to trust the process and let things play out so I urge you all to backtest as much as possible and gain confidence with it.

Follow HTF market structure first then go down to the lower TF and focus on Nova entries in the direction of the HTF trend and I promise you will be golden!

Merry christmas if you celebrate it, I don't anymore but I do it for the kids lol... But happy holidays!

could you tell more about area of interest stuff? I basically use 5m-1m only. 5m for overall trend so I do not get accidental reversal on M1 and could trade with M5 trend, also waiting for with trend signal so later I get M1 signal and my rrr gets better.

im a very mid trainer ngl so bare with me but I tried a variation using the Nova indicator you created and paired it with moving average indicator of 20~100 and Parabolic SAR .020~ .200 and as a entry limitation I focused on only low volatility markets for week 1 (which were currently in) and the only down side was the lack of opportunities for an entry in the low volatility market Im thinking of changing the entry limitation to mid-high volatility while also managing low volatility as a comparison. Do you have any suggestions to better I guess the profit whether it be indicator or whatever else? btw im using 4H timezone

Hello, XKWISIT2001， I am a novice, please ask a question, do the indicators you post on TV exist for a long time and will not be lost? If you don't delete them, do they exist for a long time? Thank you!, Thank you very much for your sharing, and I wish you a lot of money.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Hey Team, hope you had a wonderful holiday season, so far.   I like the Nova Volume Indicator.  I seem to have a natural obsession with volume and momentum along with a tendency to stay away from the market when it is ranging.  I previously used the MACD, but switched to the Impulse MACD which does a heck of a job highlighting ranging, weaker movements.   I also use the OGT to isolate price strength along with the volume indicator.  With it's emphasis on Volume, the Nova Volume Indicator fits nicely in my preferred analysis approach and can be used to confirm trades while my other indicators would keep me out of false or weak signals.  I am particularly eyeing BTCUSD, which seems to have explosive growth potential, since Trump won the election, according to many analysts.  I see good things in the future with Nova.  Look forward to interacting with everyone.

Peace out!

--- 帖子 #807 ---
I would use the tf you're comfortable with and then modify from there.

Volatility is easy to gauge... Is there news or not?

Eitherway I don't think it is ever clever to trade when there is news which is why I wait

I don't understand

Hope nova helps you on your journey

First trade of the year (Gold). The day started above the previous close but came down through the London session.  A pump back up to the close and price starts to break down at the start of the NYO. A 15 minute rotation pumps the price back up and we get a little M pattern followed by an engulfing candle, red Nova, EMA's stacked and starting to spread (price was at a 50 level). 100 pip trade down to the 50 round number.

@xkwisit2001

Dude, first off im really grateful for you taking the time and effort to make and put out this indicator, took me a while to read the entire thread, and it caught my attention mainly because of the samuel jackson pfp. With 10 years of experience on here, i have nothing but respect for you. Nova makes one hell of a confluence if used appropriately. cant believe you still find the time to be on here with a newborn and a job with all that youve got.

i am fairly new (just a few months of experience with the markets) and just wanted to share the main things ive learnt from you on here so that i can look back at it as my first post on here, i only focus on xauusd as of now (i also have a question for you at the end):

1. market structure is key (trending or ranging)

2. volume is king

3. order flow is the foundation: pools to pools

4. nova-fib-ema-tf-trend make a good team

5. sessions: london sweeps asian, ny sweeps london

6. daily/weekly pivots acts fr good support/resistance

7. keep it simple

8. risk management helps wonders in the long run

9. Elliot wave adds more context

10. stick to one strat, and tweak it as you go, jumping strats wont get you anywhere

now my question for you is, how do you implement all of this with prop firms? i myself dont have enough funds and i feel like trusted prop firms will help me if i have a good set of confluences aligned. but i still am not sure because of the failure rate, and especially when psychology changes when theres real risk on the line. do you have any tips for the people like me. i get it that with nova, even if i just stick to one strat and trade, there should be many opportunities to enter which is really good to avoid fomo, i still feel like theres alot to be learnt on the prop firm side of the industry. what do you do different when trading props compared to real markets?

i apologize for my english as its not my first language

han

--- 帖子 #815 ---
What do you mean London sweeps Asian and New york sweeps London. Also regarding elliot wave theory I've noticed that if price is trending and then retraces there can be a slight change in mkt structure and then back with trend, for example if price is trending down price might retrace make a lower high but then a nearby higher low, then a nearby higher high and then back down aggressively - does sound right?

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Thank you for the kind message, you definitely did read the full thread and hopefully you picked up the gems along the way as they will help you.

I've actually been very inactive during this period due to working on things, some rest and of course family but I'll be back on Monday. There is alot of work to do from here as I'm just about to release new stuff... Just working out the best way to roll it out.

Trading prop firm accounts can be a little tricky on the low timeframes like M1 and M5 but the higher you go up you'll get better results.

Don't get me wrong, you can trade the M1 but the spread can kill the entry more often and as we are using precision on M1 I wouldn't really trade the lower times.

The ideal time frame for me would be H1/H4 charts for prop accounts as you'll be taking less entries but better results and it'll teach you patience.

There are a good number of opportunities on H1 especially so using Nova is all about how you would like to trade. You can follow what I do and if it works for you and you don't need to change anything then that's great but most of the time traders will modify something which is why I have always stated results can be subjective and to incorporate in your own systems first... If you don't yet have one then give mine a go but definitely use higher timeframes if you are using a prop firm.

My personal broker is zero spreads and really good volume so I benefited using the lower timeframes.

Love that you noticed the Samuel L Jackson image, believe it or not people think that's actually me sometimes

Just a tip for trading M1 charts on MetaTrader 5

Use TradingView as your charting resource and MetaTrader for placing orders.

If you want to quickly calculate position sizing, here’s a fantastic tool:

Download the 'Quick Trade MT5' Trading Utility for MetaTrader 5 in MetaTrader Market

Simply select the percentage of your account you want to risk and define the stop-loss zone using the CTRL button.

It works like a charm for fast-paced timeframes.

Gold M1 chart.  Friday closed red and coming into the NY session the day's high is hit and fails to break out (breakout stops triggered). Around 0830 (New York) the EMA's start to stack (I'm using 20/50/200 but any short/med/long should do), and a couple of minutes later Nova gives the signal and entries are around 2640.

Most of the position is closed at 2630 for 100 pips and a small trailer left open.  Very low stress - almost no draw-down.

hey xkwisit2001, i really love your work and this absolute piece of beauty called nova, it has been so good trading with it past normal days.

i have just one question regarding your favourite setup, ema flip, pullback entry,

i saw something like this has been happening quite a lot on different majors and gold.

This current one is NZDUSD, i know the overall trend from htf doesnt align, but since it is also happening even tho the trend aligns i took it as a example bcs its most recent. Okay so basically the question, is this setup valid as to ur concern, or sum u would have done differently, and if it is valid, how would u go about entering this kind of pull back, i have marked out three opportunities which should be valid, so i wanna just get ur opinion on this.

thanks in advance

Hey Borgi, I know you asked to xkwisit2001 but I just want to give my opinion as I'm interested too.

I would enter at the third opp. because I prefer to wait a strong false breakout followed by a strong pullback.

What I don't like about the previous ones: EMA's are kinda crossing and price didn't fully touch them (at least the 50 purple).

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Gold M15 - yesterday gave this 'spike-high', 'spike-low' pattern. I take this as a signal that 'something' will happen the next day (EDIT: and by 'something' I mean that it looks like someone is accumulating a position buy driving the market up, then down and closing somewhere in the middle). The morning sessions are all above the close and coming into the start of the US ssession there's a rising formation, so I'm looking for a long trade.

On the M1, we get breakout of the previous day and then a pullback at the start of the NY open. In and out for about 70 pips (to a 00 round number, giving ~1:2.75 RR) in ~ 15 minutes.

The Gold market will often put in a 50+ pip stop-hunt, so this and red news on the calendar means I'm more than happy to take this and come back for the news.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
To add to what @smoki is saying. This is a great setup. Look at the timing...waiting for the new hour would have kept you out until the bigger pullback. Also, price action before the new hour is trapping shorts - big red candle, then reverse, several times and then a pump up at the start of the new hour to take any tight stops, and induce longs. The candle at 8 minutes past the hour engulfs all of that, and you've got an indication of volume strength from nova.

This move ends at the end of a 15-minute candle (45 minutes into the hour). This was a well-engineered trade (10 pips in about 45 minutes)!

(EDIT: 10 pips not 100!!!)

Thanks to both of u guys, could see it more clearly now.

But one question to TabletTop, i have seen many of ur posts here, and im genuinely interested about ur strat, like do you only focus on PDL/PDH/PDC, some MTF analysis or just price action or like what do u do that makes it so clear for u. Also u are using some things i just havent learned about or just too lazy to apply, so yeah its very interesting to me personally. Just fyi im mainly focusing on S/R zones and market structure with the confluence of the nova, taking trades based on OPs strategy, so ur drive is kinda interesting to me and would like to know more if u are willing to share.

Again big thanks to u guys

Good day all, I am finally back!

I can't believe I haven't taken a trade in so long... Hope you all have green pips and I'll be posting some of my trades today!

--- 帖子 #829 ---
My entries align with xkwisit's description, except I use 20/50/200 EMA rather than 50/100/200.  I don't think it makes any difference on entries, but I will often check price in relation to the 20 ema on the m5 chart to help identify a reversal. I think you can get the same confirmation by checking the Nova signal line on the m5, but I've done it this way for a long time.

My strategy (is nothing new and based on stuff I've picked up on here, through books and a couple of decent YouTubers) is to trade setups (i.e. well-engineered patterns I can easily recognise). Very roughly:

The previous day/week/month highs and lows are where traders tend to place orders, to catch breakouts or limit losses.  The previous d/w/m close is important (all major news and reports compare price now to yesterday's close) and price will often trade away and then come back to these levels. 00 and 50 are also important, also the 25/75 levels on many markets.

When significant highs or lows are broken, we either get a breakout, a reversal or a range and so I look for setups where this has or is happening.  I particularly like shorting markets that fail to breakout of the weekly high (I also like inside days and outside days, and there are others).

Timing - I'm UK based and so I see decent moves from 0700 on some currency pairs, but I mostly wait for the US sessions from 1300 to 1600 works well for me (1430 to 1600 for the equity markets).  The other aspect of timing is the hourly and 15-minute rotation - when a setup is well-engineered, the move happens around the new hour or 15-minute candle.

Price action - double/triple tops and bottoms, pin bars and engulfing candles - AT LEVELS AND TIME are used to confirm that highs or lows are locked in (e.g. double top in London at 00 or previous close indicates that the high of the day is probably locked).

I have a handful of markets to look through, I'll pick the ones that are presenting possible setups and wait for the EMAs and Nova to meet entry criteria.

My suggestion is to get an indicator(s) that show the previous m/w/d h/l/c and take a look at how larger moves set up on the H1 chart.  Look for repeating patterns (esp. when price comes off the previous close) and notice how the setup forms over a few days.  Drop down to the M15 or M5 and look at the timing of the big moves. Do the same with H4 charts to get an appreciation of how the week evolves.

Wow some amazing gold entries on offer today.

All at least 1:2 - I had a play around to see how far they would go and what R:R they would have been and we are looking at the following:

Trade 1: 4.21R

Trade 2: 9.33R

Trade 3: 3.75R

Trade 4: 3.01

Trade 5: 2.0R

Trade 6: 6.16R

Total RR of 28.46R!!!!!

I know it is hindsight for the R:R but the proof is in the pudding there... it is possible to take a good chunk if you stick to your favoured R:R

For me it's 2:1 so that would be 12R for today on those signals alone!

Thank you xkwisit2001 for sharing this.

You were the first tradingview strategy guy I found. i have been looking at your strategy since yesterday i joined this forum. The results from today. caught 3 of them live. I wish there was a mt5 to allow me go back more but i will keep forward testing. It is incredible stuff.

One question are you using the standard or no commission account with Icmarket. registered but on demo for now.

Also, watched it on GU and it caught the sell off. Simple but shocked at this efficiency. Will keep backtesting cause of my schedule to not get carried away taking all trades but amazing stuff.

Thanks for sharing for free. I just using it basic, confirmation and Sl behind ema. the simplest way and it is interesting.

6 wins 12RR

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Would like to compliment you xkwisit2001 on sharing this strategy that seems to be working well. I went over the complete thread and found it simple and profitable.

I would you to explain a bit more on the MTF approach, where you look at say 5 min to signal a change of direction and then switch to 1 min to start taking entries. For e.g. if the 5 min signal line crosses the zero line, would you then see if the price is above the 200EMA for long trades or below for short trades?

Once again a nice system!

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Hi Miron, I use a raw spread account with IC - it's just overall the best way to trade even with the comms.

Spread can kill the entries with Nova on some instruments.

Love to see people catching these great trades Nova provides, however just remember where you are in a trend and also key levels because you can sometimes end up in a range. Nova does a good job of telling you when to stay out though (background white/black or whatever your background is set to) but not all the time.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Hi Dot, what I would do is wait for the higher timeframe signal line to cross the 0 level direction of the trend.

Then I would go to my lower timeframe and follow the nova signals.

As long as you can see clear market structure then you can have more confidence knowing it should be more in your favour.

Make sure whatever you are looking at on the HTF, ensure there is a clear trend direction.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Not much news today so it could possibly range but bear that in mind. I will be taking trades around London/NY crossover.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
rememeber NY is closed today due to president carter. so volume might be affected

--- 帖子 #839 ---
STUDY THIS CAREFULLY!

When it comes to volume here is the best thing you will see today, week, month or even year!

On the left we have XAUUSD (IC Markets) & on the right is GC Futures both M1 chart

Nova as it is works very profitably with this IC Markets data but by using the futures centralised data you will never be more confident... I am going to switch to GC data!!!

You can see on the left chart during the range that the data nova is receiving is awful and has no clear direction, whereas on the right chart GC feed you can see the white histogram bars showing the buying volume from smart money.

Also have a look at the signal lines on both charts... GC you'd know exactly what is happening and what may happen next.

Marking the low of that first strong volume candle (far left of both charts - Also check the nova histogram) you can see that when price returns to it it rockets up but comparing the 2 you can see GC went exactly to the pip whereas IC Markets did not and you'd have missed the fill.

Is this not AMAZING???????

I think I have found my new edge

--- 帖子 #840 ---
That's an amazing discovery. Thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
It was extremely surprising considering I already knew GC is the best data but comparing the 2... it's crazy as you will definitely remove many losses.

I've just been too comfortable with my current profitability, but this will change a lot... especially the signals created by nova.

trades for the day. still keeping simple till i understand well

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Thanks for highlighting this.  I'm very interested to see how you get on and will take a closer look.  I've always suspected that exchange volume was the way to go, but have read that broker data is very close to exchange volume data (and if it wasn't there would be an arbitrage opportunity, though I've no idea how true this is).  What your chart comparison seems to be showing is that it may be true that broker exchange volume data are mostly similar, it's where they are different that is important.

I know a few folk who have moved from spot/cfd to futures but I've not looked into it at all.  Are you considering trading futures?

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Yeah the CME feeds the futures data into the other banks and brokers that have their own liquidity pools. So with IC Markets they get their actual data from a bunch of different pools but they all come from the CME initially.

I don't think I will move to futures as I am happy how things are, but I am possibly going to incorporate the 2 in certain conditions (GC & IC).

If you go on to GC you will see Nova receives so much data that the histogram bars are insanely large which means you have to superzoom into the histogram to see the smaller bars.

The difficulty here is that you need to adjust entry style with the GC data to maybe enter directly after background change whereas you can gradually see things building up on IC markets feed which is why I like my 3rd histo bar open entry style.

So without making things sound complicated or confusing... I will just put it like this:The GC (CME) data is best for seeing the institutional volume and what they're doing especially during ranges... especially perfect during ranges to see if they're buying or selling mainly IC Markets or other data with deep retail liquidity is good to see what is going on on the retail side I think I've cracked that so far so will let you know about my findings... always learning something new each day!

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Hi xkwisit, as I've been focusing on trading FX pairs (mainly USD/JPY), what would you recommend regarding volume? Would switching to the FX futures volume feed from CME be better, or is retail volume from IC Markets still sufficient for Nova?

--- 帖子 #847 ---
IC Markets data is fine mostly, it certainly has been good for me. But I do believe having the CME data will give you an edge over retail simply because it is the institutional data feed.

In my previous post I mentioned that the data is huge from CME/COMEX so nova ends up going crazy... it works fine but I mean the scaling is crazy as you cant see the low volume bars on the histogram and not sure how to combat that really. You just have to zoom in closer.

Before you purchase the data feed, have a look at the futures instruments on tradingview first so you can see how it reacts.

For me, I have 2 screens with both charts open split screen so its very easy to follow and monitor both at the same time and then place trades on my broker account with MT4.

USD/JPY is called 6J in the futures market but it is basically upside down to USD/JPY chart if that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
So I dont know if I found something that actually works or not I' m testing it right now, but I think using the nova indicator and marking where there is a "not smooth movement" and marking for the bullish candle a rectangle on the bottom and viceversa for the bearish it seems to get lots of responsive movements.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Looking at that where you have marked has the strong volume bars so when price returns to that area you could get a low risk entry.

It would typically be an order block in the ICT world but just go to keep the overall trend direction in mind. So if in a bullish scenario you could get a very low risk entry on retest but after the bearish volume has reduced or swapped sides on histogram (where your vertical line is)... that was a good entry and you marked it.

You could also see the bearish volume reducing on the retest of the low (divergence) and signal line starting to cross back up.

Good stuff, love hearing everyones insights.

Also, if you are bored you can have a play around with the settings.

Signal period will be more responsive whereas higher numbers i.e 20 you'll see it smooth out.

Volatility period is based on how many bars you want it measure.

Just took this on gold

Quick 2:1

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Is there a function in Pinescript to allow users to define the max/min of the indicator window?  I think there is a way in MT4/5 but no idea about TV.  (Rescaling is no biggie)

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Just found it.

Right click on the far right of the nova indicator where the values are and you can set it to auto scale.

This helps when jumping from 1 timeframe to another but you still have to scale in to see the smaller bars if there is much higher volume.

It's a bit finicky though as you sometimes have to press auto again - not sure why.

EDIT: I think if you don't mess with nova scaling after you hit auto it won't revert back but as soon as you do and try to see smaller bars it will reset.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Got it - that makes it easier to review - thanks

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Hi, so you just analyse market o futures and trade on spot for getting better signals and less fakes by purchasing real time data for futures markets?

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Yes to a degree, you want to have both at your disposal to monitor what smart money is doing and what retail is doing.

Retail entries will be easier to enter as you are seeing the lower volume as things ramp up which is in line with my 3rd histo bar open entry.

Depending on the time, the CME data can be traded as is but if it's moving heavily then it can be difficult to read the data as every bar is large....... buuutt if you get in at the earliest signs then you can follow smart money.

Have a look at GC and IC markets (XAUUSD) and can then analyse how it moves.

The insights are pretty great!

Check below and you can see in this instance IC Markets actually looks better here compared to the actual CME data.

This may be because smart money isn't trading as much right now and a lot more traders through the liquidity provider that IC Markets use are active (retail)

EDIT: Funnily enough there is divergence on those lows between the 2.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Hmm I've been having a think and on my last reply post something seems rather odd.

People believe they are being stop hunted by institutional money but yet on the chart I posted you can clearly see that the retail broker had the lower low.

If institutions or "smart money" were hunting stops, it would reflect on centralized markets like COMEX surely?

This actually seems to show that it's the liquidity providers that actually manipulate the price which will obviously be banks.

I think there is a misconception between institutional trading and banks/liquidity providers that manipulate price.

Check this:

On the below chart you would most likely believe that price will continue down after the pullback as it created a lower low (on IC XAUUSD).

However, CME data shows it was more or less a double bottom hence why price actually reversed.

I know spot fx and futures are different things but it tells an interesting story.

My take is:GC futures = Institutional flows, centralized market. XAUUSD = Retail noise, decentralized OTC market.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Basically, you look at both datas given, inspect which one moves market more(institutions or retail traders) and based on that select where to take signals from?

Good approach, I like that, you have to adapt to power side when trading volume.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
During CME hours I would primarily focus on GC for how its moving and the volume shown.

But you will also need to also look at what IC is doing too as that is more the retail side of things.

You'll notice a lot when backtesting that there are many instances of IC showing a lower low but GC showing a higher low and vice versa.

Futures charts will and can be different which I understand but what I am observing is how the liquidity providers manipulate the price compared to CME where the data actually comes from.

Small bars on GC doesn't mean there is no volume, it's more that the low volume translated into IC looks like higher volume as retail are a small fraction of the market.

But going forward, I am observing the correlation between both for future trades and if I find anything to report on then I'll of course post.

EDIT: Of course executions will be made on your own broker but it's good to look at both and also consider different stops to eliminate being wicked out by the liquidity providers/Brokers

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Very interesting observations.  I have seen a youtube video (a long time ago and can't find it now - I think it may have been the BTMM guy) showing what you describe on a DOM/Matrix-type chart.  It showed retail broker spreads widening at highs and lows, which could be what is being seen on your chart.  It's hard to know precisely what is causing it; it could be brokers, the LP's, or maybe just the difference between spot and the next month out.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Interesting take. So many times have I fallen into this trap, thinking that the market broke a high/low structure, which made me believe that the market was following its trend (based on basic market structure principles), only for it to actually create a fakeout and reverse the move.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Hey guys, hope you did well today and banked some pips!

Nova performance today has been great and today has currently offered up to 15R and a possible extra 6R still open.

I tend to get on around 11am GMT time so that's pretty much when I start looking for entries.

I don't take every single entry and I am pretty picky about what I do enter but when I share here I will mark them all up for you to see what is possible.

I marked the NFP entry to show it hit as much as a 6.7R but I would have maybe got out at the first sign of weakness which was the first white candle at the low and that would have been a 5.5R win but I didn't take a trade for NFP... oh well.

Todays Nova performance is: 8 wins at 2R (green dotted vertical lines) 1 loss 1R (red dotted vertical line) 3 entries still open (white dotted vertical lines) I would have closed the open ones by now to be honest but if not they can only hit a break even.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
This was me today. Watched. still on demo and deciding what time to come to the market but lovely simple setup you have. Was beautiful on GU today too. This was Gold for me

--- 帖子 #864 ---
You gained a 1 to 3R trade or you mean you lost 1 out of 3?

If you gained then that's great but looking over your entries... do a little backtesting to enter at the open of the 3rd histogram bar in the direction the background colour is telling you.

I.e when in an uptrend and the background turns blue then enter on the 3rd histogram bar candle with a stop loss below the recent swing low.

If you're using this with your own strategy then you can ignore me though but that is how I like to enter. Always best to see 2 consecutive bars in the direction of the background colour.

Hope that makes sense but you'll get better with it over time or if you read through the thread.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Great stuff mate! you'll fall in love with nova over time once you gain confidence.

in what way do younuse these pivot levels for your trading?

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Been using this system since late December, and it's been profitable so far.

I'm wondering if there's a tip on how to minimise some annoying stops that hit the intended target later

An example from yesterday:

--- 帖子 #870 ---
When price has been above the 50 EMA for a while, you want to wait for a bigger pullback into the moving averages before jumping into a trade. Price tends to "recharge" between the 50 and 100 EMAs before continuing its move.

If the EMAs have already flipped into an uptrend and you caught the Nova entry on the first pullback after where you marked the shift, I’d typically wait for Nova to show a deeper pullback before taking another trade unless there are bigger swings like the downtrend before.

Where the Nova background turned white, that’s where you start watching for entries. Once it flips back to blue, that’s your signal the trend might be ready to resume but remember to only enter when the signal line is curving back up towards the 0 level or it is above the 0 level.

Hope that makes sense to you, if not... to simplify it:

Keep an eye on the signal line. If it has been above the 0 level for too long... wait for it to go below 0 and then start going back above the 0 level again

--- 帖子 #871 ---
I will share this in a later reply in more detail but essentially what I am doing is using the fixed volume profile in trading view and marking the last 4 or 5 previous weeks and then marking a horizontal line on every value area high, value area low and point of control.

This is a bit more advanced BUT I am in the process of adding this to the nova indicator to plot automatically... was just a little sneak peek to see how people would respond

If there are no targets above where price is, then I go back to any previous week where there is an overlapping candle and mark it out so I can see future targets.

If price is at all time highs then this isn't possible though lol.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Have you attempted to compile/normalize all of the various retail data volume sources that tradingview offers? Then compare it to futures.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Can you elaborate on your suggestion? My undertsanding is volume data is dependant on which brokers feed you pick. there isnt any centralised volume data. Im not aware of any method to "compile" data from more than one broker.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
I don't really have the time to do that. I just focus on what I am trading.

Each data feed is different though across almost every broker. A lot of them actually use the same shared liquidity pool but their data would be different as they themselves have a liquidity pool which is their own customers.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Do you also wait for some new histogram bars showing up in the other direction of the trend so it forms a bit of a bigger retracement? Because In terms of entering on the 3rd candle open after like a different coloured histogram there would've been more entry's. I put some yellow circles around them in the indicator so it's better visible what I mean.

What is the reason you don't take these trade or is this just pure expertise?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #876 ---
It's more down to exposure in the market. There are more entries but I am someone that prefers 1 in 1 out. You could use the other signals to stack entries but if you risk 1% and just entered 5 signals that have yet to hit target then you could be 5% down from just 1 single candle.

You can take any signal that fits your criteria... For me I prefer it to be after a swing low and then there's a build up in volume that follows which is why I'd then enter after the 2nd histogram bar closes and 3rd one opens. You'll often find that entries on the 3rd bar open tend to move the most after a swing low allowing you to get a 2:1 much faster.

If you risk 1% you could actually lower risk and do say 0.25% and be able to end up with an overall risk of 1% across 4 trades... It all depends on risk tolerance and what keeps the mind at peace.

3 wins and 1 loss today. I saw gold was pretty extended on the 4 hour and it was retracing. I marked the 50% level and watched for sells all morning. A higher risk trading day but it worked. Also something I am going to watch since there is a correlation between AUD and Gold I traded a 1 min strategy about a year ago AUDUSD with some success between 9:40am and 10:10Am eastern time. Its something I am going to work into my trading plan. It looked like it would have helped staying

out of the market the last 3 days during that time.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Very good performance, If you traded 1 time per day and hit 3 out of 4 and didn't trade on fridays that's a very good win rate... 75%

You could have gained a lot more with stops above the highs on the first 3 and it's possible the 3rd wouldn't have been a loss.

I say that as a I know a lot of people trade props and with a 50-300k account that would be amazing work for those that do.

Keep at it, you'll soon gain more confidence with it.

Yes i use Ma's alll the time . its not just ema you can set a number of averages. You can read up what it does on trading view.

it just signals crossovers of slow and fast.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
For those trading Nova, if there is a massive bar on the histogram then do not take the trade as more than likely it's taking out liquidity which means it'll take the opposing side.

Nova entries are always best when volume builds up bar by bar so.

If anyone is confused, I can show some examples but it's pretty easy to spot especially on gold.

Right now I am more comfortable with taking entries off the 50ema and stops at the 200ema but yes, I actually enjoyed trading today. I appreciate you sharing your thoughts!

Sorry for my absence guys, I have been extremely ill this week. Flu kept me bed ridden along with the rest of my family.

However, it seems that the steam has run out of this thread as there has been hardly any action

Not sure if there is anything people need help with but having gone through nova this week there has been some amazing trades so for those using it I hope you did well.

The success of this thread lies with those people who use and believe in it so if without me things go quiet then I suppose I can confirm I've done my job here.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
It uses the best available data. If standard broker volume then it is based on tick data. If centralised volume then it'll pull that data feed and be based on real time volume.

Have a look at futures data.. Especially gold and how nova behaves compared to normal broker data.

u can delete this post too. i messaged him here because i thought i was still too new to private msg. didnt realise i was able too now though. either way thanks again!

--- 帖子 #896 ---
No worries, that's understandable. Nothing wrong with asking questions etc... i'm not a gatekeeper lol.

But if new people arrive here, the thread is best served on topic that's all.

Hi Xkwisit,

Are you using futures volume for gold now as your standard?

thanks

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Hi xkwisit2001, firstly many thanks for sharing this strategy, indicator, and all the guidance in the thread.  I’ve read through it and taken many notes.  I’m still trying to integrate it into my trading and it shows much promise.  I plan to post my trades on this thread once I’ve spent longer with it.

Earlier in the thread you refer to an updated version of the indicator you plan to release, are you still thinking of doing so?  I really appreciate all the work you’ve put into it and that you’ve done all this for free, just the additional alerts it will have (according to the earlier posts) would be very handy.

I’ve used the TradingView workspace you linked to earlier too where it has additional alert criteria available (particularly the background colour change) however whilst TradingView allows me to open the alert creation screen from it, it can’t create the alert itself as it says the indicator hasn’t been made public which I assume is due to it being a newer version of the indicator in the workspace (think it said it was version 7 in the workspace) rather than the one made public.

Hope your recovery from the flu is speedy!

Thanks!

Nova had some awesome 1:2s yesterday in NY session. no losses. 7 winners.

1m chart

EMAs: 34. 55. 89

Heiken bars

Fractal 3 (stoploss)

Don't want the thread to die.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
@MoochMooch That looks great!

Have you waited for NY session to start to jump in?

Why Fractals as a stop loss?

--- 帖子 #901 ---
The thread won't die, I'm still here lol

--- 帖子 #902 ---
I was going to release updates but there aren't enough people interested so there isn't any point adding anything more because it will confuse people

--- 帖子 #903 ---
I consider it, but don't use it totally because it doesn't tell the full story. It gives a clear indication of overall direction though.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
This is what my charts look like, but not many people follow so it's hard to help everyone.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
is this nova + snr pa?

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Hello dear friend, don't you use emas?

--- 帖子 #907 ---
ooh is that quarterly theroy?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hello xkwisit2001,

I struggled for three years relying solely on price action until I realized something was missing. I have personally studied VSA (Volume Spread Analysis) since 2023, but without success.

Nova is the final missing piece of my puzzle, and I am confident this is my last stop in the search for the holy grail.

Let me tell you—I have gone through countless threads, carefully selecting only those authored by individuals who have started just one or two threads since their sign-up (ideally, those who have been on FF for 10+ years). In my opinion, these people are the truly successful traders, and you are one of them (with proof). So, if only a few people are engaged in your thread, don’t assume it lacks interest; it simply means that true professional and profitable traders don’t talk much or participate in many threads. They are profitable and prefer to keep their secrets.

Bref, valuable insights and knowledge are often the least known. If I may share my perspective—Nova is already perfect as it is: simple and efficient. Instead of modifying it, any upgrade should be a Version 2 (Super Nova) while keeping Nova untouched.

I can’t thank you enough for this.

P.S.: I trade only XAUUSD.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Hello xkwisit2001, all,

First of all let me thank you xkwisit2001 for your this system. You are very kind.

I'm struggling to identify the exact rules for entry candle. Could someone clarify me?

So the EMAs need to be align up or down. On Nova Volume indicator the entry candle is the next candle when green Bar is above 0 and above blue line and when blue line is greater than 0? See image below..

Thank you Luis

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Appreciate you don't want to complicate things.  If you ever changed your mind though even just an alert for the background colour changes would be very useful as it's one of the main signals.

Thanks again for your time and work on this.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Strongly agree with what have been said above

If you in the future decide to recreate and upgrade the Nova version please do V2 version as currently, this is working perfectly. People just need to focus and backtest

--- 帖子 #912 ---
What I'm looking for is

1. EMA are above for sell'

2. Break of the closes low

3. Nova indicator showing sells (2 bars)

--- 帖子 #913 ---
I do use EMA's but not all the time, I can see them without having them on the chart if that makes sense lol

No but quarterly theory does seem to work well but it makes things complicated

Thank you for your kind words, I'm soon to release a new update. I was open to doing more frequent ones here but I didn't think there was enough input for me to do that. But, yes there will be a new one on tradingview soon

--- 帖子 #914 ---
What a great system! Trade Nova for a week on demo and great results so far!

I'll do some more demo trading to learn nova better.

Many thanks for sharing this great strategy!

--- 帖子 #915 ---
This is awesome. Have anybody tried combining weis wave volume with Nova?

I remember one weis wave indicator for metatrader that had pullback levels,

support and resistance levels. I lost mine. I hope to find it again in order to use

it with nova. Does anybody have a copy of that particular weis wave indicator with the pullback levels for metatrader?

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Do not forget that Live is a different story due to the spreads and commissions you will be paying.

If I would be you have a small account and start with small lots

--- 帖子 #917 ---
I hope you're still working on your update. Could you elaborate a little bit more about the volume profile, please?

If you're interested, there's also a new indicator that draws profiles using swing pivots.
https://www.tradingview.com/script/8...er-ChartPrime/

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Yes, I also request an alert for the background colour changes which will be very helpful

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Point of control lines are very important leading indicator. Appreciate that you will be adding it to nova soon..

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Have been working on a new system alongside nova to make things much easier to find the best entries and repeatable every single day.

Just not sure whether to start a new thread on it or continue here.

My chart for today

Perfect bounce zones.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Thank you for sharing your system.  I have recently discovered it and I am trying it out for the last few days.  Still getting to grips with it and adjusting it a little to my trading style. Looks like it is a consistent and reliable system.

I believe you should share your new system here or if you think it will be seen by more people as a new thread then just post a link here.

Look forward to your new system.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Hi again,

Do you want to share a new system or a "new indicator" to complete with Nova? IMO, it will be nice if you have two independent and clean threads if it concerns "a new system" (and I hope it will skyrocket on FF and be your last thread ); but let's hear out some opinions from other followers.

Take care

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Start a new thread and redefine the entry criteria so it's nice and clear and then everyone's on the same page.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Chart update:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This will be what the full system looks like.

What I'm doing is making sure there are realistic targets for Nova when entering positions and then I think the system is fully complete and it can then be 'SuperNova'

I did have an update for nova that was almost ready but needed to also incorporate my deviation lines which plot each day so decided to bring it into.

So on the chart there is:Nova Volume Indicator Deviation Lines with midpoints (horizontal lines) Pivot swing points for market structure (dots) 3 EMA's for trend direction I will try my best to get the update out this week and then my work here on the system will be done

--- 帖子 #925 ---
That actually looks great!

Cant wait for the new update, but as every system there will be always something to add and change

--- 帖子 #926 ---
cant wait for the new update thanks for this bro. it look likes to me nova with snr

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Are the deviation lines going to be plotted automatically?

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Yes every day

--- 帖子 #929 ---
I just found you this past weekend.  And now I just finished reading the last of the 47 pages of comments.  Phenomenal stuff, and I'm super excited to be here just as you are rolling out the new stuff.  I started trading this Monday and have had 3 straight green days.  I'm down 2r this morning on a wild consolidation on silver futures but I know the coming expansion will give loads of juicy opportunities to get green for the day and grow my returns for the week.

I messaged you (and you replied) but I want to thank you again publicly for this.  It really is fantastic work!

--- 帖子 #930 ---
Mad respect for going through all 47 pages, that’s real commitment!

Great to hear you’re already stacking green days. Silver loves to mess around like gold does, but you know the deal… once that expansion hits, it’s game on.

Appreciate you sharing this, always good to see others benefiting. But like I’ve said, this system is subjective... some will get it, some won’t.

It all comes down to putting in the extra work and understanding how it works and how YOU wish to trade.

I’ll be more active here in the coming days/weeks (been tied up with Nova and new baby duties lol), but let’s keep pushing and if anyone has any questions let me know!

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Is there a good way to spot when an expansive or very trending movement is coming?

--- 帖子 #932 ---
If you follow market structure then you just need to keep an eye on the trend direction (EMA's).

With enough time you can see when the trend is shifting from consolidation to trend and then find opportunities.

Apply the EMA's and when you see the EMA's fan out that's the trend potentially beginning.

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Over the previous day or so, the moving averages got extremely tight on the lower timeframes.  There were moments they seemed to be actually equal.  I don't trade Bollinger Bands, but if you throw them on the chart, you will see the tightest locations are when the MAs are getting close together and moving sideways.

This occurs before a big move, with longer consolidations typically preceding bigger expansions.  Take a look at the 1h candle at 0300 EST yesterday on SI.  You then had 4 entire 1H candles that remained within that range.  The next candle (0800 EST) manipulated to take the liquidity below the range and then went on an unmitigated tear to the upside.

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Just to add the best M1 entries will be when the 4HR/D1 nova is giving a signal.

That is a good sign to hold if you want to go for bigger RR with zero risk (if set to BE)

That's pretty much what I look out for... daily nova signal will tell you if things are looking good for the week or weeks

When 4HR/D1 is ranging and there is no signal then that's when you go on holiday or enjoy your life and family etc lol

--- 帖子 #935 ---
5R from this today on gold... Nova will deliver if you follow the trend

Deviation lines working perfectly - look at the current bar

Lines automated.. zero adjustment & tp would be hit to the pip!

If you take the time to read this thread you will be profitable

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Hey man, still playing around with this, seems great, I'm just yet to commit, as I have a HTF strat atm.

One question i have, is how do you enter? as in, do you use limit? market? etc? as I've found it's difficult to get a good entry on the 3rd candle, after putting in SL etc, finding the lot size and actually entering the trade, the trade often has moved away, leaving a sub par entry.

Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #937 ---
The resiliency of this method is what is impressing me.  Two days running, I have found myself on the wrong side of London.  Yesterday, I fully recovered.  Today, I swung from -3r to 3r in the course of a few minutes.  Yes, you will have losses - like literally every other method.  But then the swing comes and you are right back in and running with the momentum.  This is one of the most enjoyable trading methods I've found in about 4 years of serious trading.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Are you trading directly in TV? When the 5m signal tells me my direction, I wait for the 1m to come out of that direction and wait until it moves back with the 5m trend with background color and below/above the signal line as required. When I get my first candle, I draw my long/short position tool with my SL 1 tick beyond the high/low of the move. Right click, choose "Create limit order". Change limit order to market in the trading window.  Enter your risk $/%. When the 3rd candle opens, trigger the trade. Then adjust the TP to 2x whatever the end result was for your SP after you get filled. It takes me maybe 20 seconds to do it all and you have a few minutes to do it.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
I would like to create an Alert when the background color changes to Green/Red. I can see that there is a Bullish Momentum and Bearish Momentum Alerts can be configured.  Is this same as background color changes to Green/Red?

--- 帖子 #940 ---
I have a new update coming that will have that alert.

These ones?

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Thank you xkwisit2001. That will be great. When you are planning to release the update?

--- 帖子 #942 ---
i have tried to used it before but somehow I did not found it very effective

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Past few day's consolation trick me couple of times, but have not provided any decent trades

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Market's been dead lately.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Hey if your thinking of doing an update to the indicator, great job btw, can you add an alert when there are 2 green / 2 red bars in a row, at the alert will show at the close of the 2nd green or red bar

Also have an option you can turn off alerts for buy and sell or have them on individually if that makes sense, indicator is great btw!! so thank you

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Just been testing it all works properly. Last thing I want is to release something that has issues lol

Seems to be working well so will be updated on tradingview very soon. Possibly this weekend

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Already done it

Will be ready soon

--- 帖子 #948 ---
Great cant wait to see the update

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Yesterday I blundered. I bought Gold instead of using the 15m to check for the direction. I used my gut feeling that Gold was going up LOL.  If I had used the 15m and 1m I would have been in profits.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
I'm sure in one of the pages guys shared a good indicator to show you the trend on different timeframes. I have not used it, but now when I'm thinking about it might be a very good tool. I will share it if I will find it.

EDITED

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Depending on how you trade it's always best to check the HTF first. For me I use 4hr and then base my actions on that. Can take some time for LTF to align but as long as you know you're good.

--- 帖子 #952 ---
You can literally just use the EMAS I mentioned on HTF to get direction

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Hi,

Any reason why the indicator doesn't seem to be working on some pairs on trading view?

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Hi, I just finished reading 48 pages of this thread, and it was amazing to see the strategy evolve. Thank you, xkwisit2001, for sharing your market approach. It’s clear that you’re very skilled in the market, and you’ve definitely helped many people who knew how to take advantage of the opportunity.

I also wanted to ask when you’ll show us your new approach with Supernova. I’m really curious and eagerly waiting to see and test it myself.

I’m a 19-year-old guy, but since I work, I don’t have much time to stay on the trading chart—I only study in the evenings and have been doing so for a year now. However, I still haven’t found a solid swing/intraday approach with a good win rate. I hope you can help me soon.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Make sure the broker you have selected for your pair supports volume.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
First and foremost, I would like to thank xkwisit2001 for sharing this indicator and simple system.

May I know if there is a MT4 version of this indicator?

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Hello everyone!

Thank you @xkwisit2001 for sharing this system with us. I've been using it for a month and it has been working great (around 80% wr with a 1:1 rr).

I'm not using the NOVA volume but another indicator which I prefer. I also found that using linear regression channel can help a lot in your entries/exits.

Here's an example of a trade I took yesterday on XAUUSD.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Hi, there wont be. Its exclusive on TV only.

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Hope that xkwisit is doing okay

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Hey there, any joy in creating the alerts to the TV indicator

thanks

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Hi guys, how is this volume.

--- 帖子 #962 ---
What do you mean?

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Hello! Can you tell me which indicators is the one at the bottom of the image?

--- 帖子 #964 ---
I'm okay

--- 帖子 #965 ---
My apologies for my absence, have been so bogged down with new baby and juggling business.

I will get back to everyone and get this thread back on track as I am sure many have questions about the system and the new changes I've made which I need to publish.

Hope everyone is doing well

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Hey hey,

Don’t worry we have patience

thank you for the heads up and yes we (Im definitely) will be waiting for the update

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Looking forward to this man!

I have replied to all dms now so just need to go through the ones on here lol

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Hello! New to this thread. Currently going through the pages!

Ive been looking for a volume indicator of some sort to aid me with my current strategy that pretty much keeps my account at almost break even. good days and bad days balance themselves out. Feel like adding in some volume indicators for some help in decision making would be beneficial. Came across this thread luckily and will be following along!

I added the indicator to my Trading view template and currently trade Futures of: NQ, DOW, Gold, Oil, and the major currency pairs.

Thanks for the thread and the indicator!

Also: The updates for the alerts that were mentioned back in February don't seem to be showing yet. I downloaded your indicator and was trying to to set alerts for background color change.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I feel I downloaded the correct indicator cause it's the only one I can find lol

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Hello xkwisit2001, I remember you very well. Good job on this thread. Looks good and it just works. That's just lovely. :o) Glad you learned something new. Might use it with my old ideas. Also have even more ideas however I'm without a computer, yay. It's been years now...

Will be back soon,

SF

--- 帖子 #971 ---
I will update the indicator for those alerts tomorrow so they will take effect immediately.

There is a bigger update coming though but I have just had so much to do generally that I've not had the chance to release it especially working 100%.

In trading, 1 small error with an indicator can lead to losses so I'd rather keep my name intact and not release junk but the background change does work.

It'll be better if used on a higher TF though to allow you to know what direction price is heading.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Thank you very much for the kind words, I had been frustrated for so long to have something that actually made sense and I realised it was volume.

I hate that it is an indicator but how else would you know? lol

It'll be far better soon, I've been doing alot of daddy duties so have not been able to sink the time into trading this year but things are looking good now.

Glad you are here and I'm all ears for new ideas too

Be sure to ask anything you want here I will offer as much as I can

Thanks bud

--- 帖子 #973 ---
I will try and get the alerts update out today on tradingview ready for monday.

Apologies it has taken so long but I don't and will never release something I have not tried and tested 100%

--- 帖子 #974 ---
I have a new baby in the house. little girl, 5 months old. 2 other girls aswell. Full house here so I understand! Like I said im new to this thread But ill be a regular now. I like this volume indicator alot.

I do have a question or an idea. Not sure if its a good one or not but its something thats been in my head for a volume indicator.

So instead of having volume displayed on either side. having volume displayed on both sides of the zero line simultaneously.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Kind of like this. Pardon my TERRIBLE mouse skills. But this is the idea thats in my head. Not sure if it would be beneficial but I feel it could show signs of potential reversal given how big the green candles/red candles are in the given trend. So as the down trend starts to slow down you can see a notice of green candles getting bigger as apposed to the red candles getting small, sort of like a divergence in volume.

If this idea has been done before and didnt work out then my apologies.

Just an idea i've had, i have no idea how to code and I cant seem to find a volume indicator like that.

Also, this game is all about patience right? So im assuming we all should have some patients in you putting out your update lol. Take your time, I appreciate the due diligence in supplying a working indicator and not some half finished junk. Thank you, thats awesome

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Thank you and congrats on your growing family.

If funny you said that because I have been working on that for the next update. Below is an example, however it isn't done properly yet but it will be very soon!

As you can see my coding is skills arent perfect which is why I have been having to take longer to perfect it. There are volume bars sometimes showing on both sides but this is just a temporary thing, just showing what I had been working on lol. That will most certainly be sorted soon though

The tough part is differentiating between nova using the centralised data feeds on TV (i.e centralised data for futures) and it switching to tick data (for forex).

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #976 ---
The thing is nova as it is has been working perfectly for me for a long while so any updates is to the benefits of new users.

Sometimes you don't have to change something that works for you but I understand that it may not work for others which is why I am updating but I cant just release anything I dont believe in. What I have in mind is to make sure nova is the ONLY indicator you need and if you need to know anything about trading... it is volume.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
I totally understand and agree. What ain't broke don't fix! My post was not at ALL bashing or implying that your indicator doesn't work. Honestly I've only tested it through bar replays and so far I really enjoy it.

Excited for your next update. If you ever need a guinea pig in the field for these things lemme know!

I'm thrilled to hear you already had that idea in the works. I've accomplished it with multiple indicators to an extent. One showing buy pressure and one showing sell pressure. But it just wasn't working the way I wanted to see it in my head. That picture you posted perfectly encapsulated what goes through my head when thinking of that volume indicator.

Thanks for your hard work! It's truly appreciated to those of us who haven't figured out how to code yet.

I don't know what I'm talking about here just so you know, but if your having trouble with the indicator switching from forex ticks to futures data, couldn't you have a setting in there that simply switches it manually per user? I do see the allure of it doing that automatically though

--- 帖子 #978 ---
No no I didn't think you were bashing at all, what I mean is that I have been promising the update for a while but personal things have kept me from it but I don't owe anyone to have to force myself as this is all for free. But what I think will be better is to update gradually so that users can benefit from the positive changes made.

To be honest, the indicator is a shell of what it was and it took a long time for me to get it to how it is now... was pure perfecting small changes I needed personally so I don't mind modifying it for others to use as I just wanted to give back anyway. It's all one big journey.

I'm not uber rich or anything, I literally just replaced trading with my job so I have just been crusing really but that is what many would love to be able to do so that is why I am helping.

The way I coded it was to use the data feed first but some brokers data feeds on tradingview are different so it has been a bit weird to code properly for every situation. So anything centralised will be the true data feed showing on nova but when it comes to brokers, it's based on tick data and then you have to rely on which broker has the best liquidity pool. I hate having to use tick data though but I understand the market now and can trade without nova anyway.

For an exercise, open different charts using nova and you'll sometimes see there is no data showing in nova. That is because the broker hasn't shared the data which proves nova is calculating what they feed. BUT... some brokers have low liquidity so the nova volume on 1 broker will be different to another which is why I use IC to a my main broker as their liquidity is the best.

If you look at gold futures you'll see how different it is with the real full centralised volume.

Anyways I'll quit boring you but yes I'll drop an update tomorrow for what I know works... it'll show automatically if you're using the indicator anyways but the main big update I think I'll trickle it so that I am happy with it.

Hope you and everyone else is having a good sunday and ready for tomorrow!

Still need to reply to people too so ill try and get back to every message I havent replied to. I had like 15 dms and even that took ages LOL

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Love how you can come back to the charts every day and find a quick easy entry with nova.

--- 帖子 #980 ---
2 more M1 wins

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Those are awesome!

Curious as to somehow pick your brains thought process on why you didnt take some of the other signals from before those trades?

Thats where my struggle is. I want to take every signal. Having the genious of heinsight after the fact doesnt help.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Same here. I'd been trading with Nova only when the trend was very clear, taking trades in the direction of the trend and waiting for the second bar after the volume signal appeared. I got stopped out on some occasions and decided to wait for the new update, as my entries weren't playing out properly.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Because the charts hes posting are in hindsight.

Unfortunately, as with any other indicator based signal, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
Yes it's hindsight but its experience that allows you to enter trades.

I explained at the beginning that the best entry is when the moving averages flip and you have the first pullback... how hard is that to follow?

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Why did this work?

Because the moving averaged flipped and its the first pull back

It's not hard

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Again.. why does this work?

Because the moving averages flipped and its the first pull back lol

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Again, why did this work?

Because the moving average flipped and it was the first pullback lol

This is all from today

Over time with experience you wont lose once you have a 'feel' for the market.

--- 帖子 #988 ---
And another from just before

--- 帖子 #989 ---
And again lol

I can go all day

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Moving average flip, pullback. Got it. Not sure how I missed that from the intro of the thread

--- 帖子 #991 ---
I've tried trading the flip and first pullback on demo for the last two months on gold 1min timeframe but overall I am yielding negative rr.  Is there something extra that can be added to shift into positive rr?

--- 帖子 #992 ---
I've mentioned it in the thread as my bread and butter entry

--- 帖子 #993 ---
You need to backtest it as with anything... Once you backtest you'll get confidence. I'm not sure what is making people lose money.

This is all I've ever done really

--- 帖子 #994 ---
With some of the examples above especially the short, if you go back up to the higher timeframe such as the 15min Nova would be in no trade zone. Is there a way to trade the flip even though the HTF is not supportive?

--- 帖子 #995 ---
I was considering this type of entry for my trading setups but unfortunately got stopped out on them frequently.

Per Xkwisit's advice, starting tomorrow, I'll trade only MA flips until the major update is available.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Monday 10th March between 11am - 4pm (London time) or even Tuesday 11th March similar time would have been a very tricky time to trade the flip and 1st pullback - how can we avoid this kind of market?

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Use the HTF to know when price is going to go up or down and then enter on the LTF

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Hello @xkwisit2001, first of all, I would like to thank you for your generosity. I have followed this thread since page 4 and patiently waited for updates. I really wished I saw this thread and the Nova indicator long before now, cos trading has really dealt with me and I was beginning to think it wasn't for me, but it keeps pulling me back to the chart. I have lost a lot to trading, Your story really inspired me because I saw some similarities and I have been trading on demo and it's been working, it doesn't have to be hard just do what you are asked to do, right (follow the rules and u will be fine lol). I tried it with other pairs like GBPUSD, ETHUSD, EURUSD, but I had to advise myself to trade what you trade which is xauusd. I am satisfied with my results so far and I can't wait to fund my account as soon as I can, to make real money.

I almost believe you were an angel who has completed his assignment and left when you disappeared for a short while lol. Congratulations  for the arrival of your new baby.

Your indicator peaked my interest. Here's one not using volume..

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Something that has helped me is a website called forex early warning. It follows currency strength and started gold and crypto. what I like about the gold strength it follows not only XAUUSD but all the other cross pairs in Gold that are hardly ever mentioned. I have found the easiest way is to have all in the same direction at least 0.35% and you are good for the direction along what xkwisit2001 is sharing it will give you confidence in holding the trades. This is the morning around 8am east coast. The cost $20 a month which is fairy fair what you get. I am not affiliated with them just sharing a tool that works for me.!

Do you guys have any recommended places to go to learn more about market structure? Yes I can google it, which brings up 50 million sites. Just curious if either of you have any recommended areas to start. After reading through a lot of this thread(not done yet) Im learning just how important Market structure is.. Dont wanna fall behind from lack of knowledge. Granted I know that looking at charts endlessly will help me with market structure, but without a foundation of what I'm looking at can be tricky...

Any help or guidance here would be greatly appreciated

Honestly I feel I start to get the hang of market structure, but then I change Time frames and I see more, it starts to get confusing which ones to be looking at. I get that the higher time frames produce better results for the overall structure of the market but I cant deny that on the lower timeframes price reacts to more areas. Figuring out which ones to pay attention to and the ones to disregard is the challenge.

Thanks in advance!

Appreicate the thread and the indicator BTW. I've added it to my template from Robinhoods Trading Made Simple indicator. Hoping to fine tune some of my entries and filter out the shitty trades.

Just looking at that picture, if you would have taken the trades that had the signal live above or below the zero line in the given direction you would have been in profit.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
Hmm I see what you mean, I think that was the mistake... Thanks!

It's more of a framework to follow but the issue is... too much information gives analysis paralysis early on.

Perfect for intermediate - pro levels but honestly a basic working strategy with a beginner can work too

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Market structure is dead easy but the hard part is using multiple TFs to do so. I.e you need to know where you are everywhere.

For example, if daily is due a pullback in an uptrend then there can be confusion between trend on the lower timeframes because they dont align.

That is why its easier to trade the H1 because because you dont have too much to focus on in regards to smaller structure within the higher tf structure.

I appreciate the love and kind words! the best thing is to keep things simple and try to find what works for you. I spent years trying to find something that works but that is why trading is so good. Its challenging in a good way.

There millions of ways to lose but few ways to win... but the wins are simple. Just stick to a profitable strategy that fits your style and you'll be fine.

Even a 30% win rate works but it's more to do with personality and if it works for you as it works easy with every trade being a 4:1 but you need to have the right mentality to be able to accept it.

Some people can sit in front of the screen all day and others take a 2:1 waiting a week for the trade to play out.

It's all personality based but my system works for every style of trading. I just prefer to take my money off the table fast so I trade M1.

If we are using the 15min Nova signal before dialing down to the 1min do all the same rules for entry hold.  For example today once NY opened there have been a couple of long signals on gold using NOVA (ie two bullish histograms and signal line pointing upwards plus above zero) on the 15 min chart but the emas have been declining and the candles haven't been able to climb above all 3 - so avoid dialing down and trading?

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
If using the 15m it is good to see the background colour change in the direction of the trend.

I use 5M alot and as soon as it gives a signal I will then take further signals on the M1 making sure the signal line is supporting the direction too.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
For example,

M15 is moving up here and background has turned bullish (grey/white).

You want to mark the cross with a horizontal line.

Then move down to the M1 and take the signals in the direction of the M15.

However, not every single signal is going to work out so the aim is to do this daily and grow the account 1 or 2 trades at a time.

It is always best when the signal line (yellow) is starting to cross the zero level.

The first trade I may not have taken personal but the 2nd trade I definitely would.

3rd trade you can see the volume lowering so I'd have looked to break even really but it could also have been a loss.

Unless I'm mistaken if I followed that way today of waiting for the 5min signal and then dialed down to the 1min I would be in loss today from the NY open. I dont mean that as a way to say the indicator doesn't work, I'm just frustrated with myself because I feel I'm missing something.

Today is meaningless. Tomorrow is meaningless. Yesterday is meaningless.

One bad day, or two bad days, or three bad days is terrible...

But let's say you used this for a month and every other of those days were green days. Then those 3 days in a row of bad days would have been meaningless.

If that makes sense... I guess I'm just trying to say it's about the big picture. How it works over time.. and I've noticed when I'm new to ANY STRATEGY, it feels like I don't fully grasp it till I do. You can give every trader the same strategy and everyone will get different results.

If you like this strategy, stick with it, give it a month, journal your trades. If you can take screenshots of every trade taken. Analyze at the end of the day and at the end of the week.

Sounds like a lot, and it is a lot... But this shit ain't easy. Gotta put in that work. Once you start journaling and seeing what's working and what is t, you can start to eliminate some of those losses. Then you start to trust the strategy, then the psychology doesn't affect you so well when you lose a few trades in a row cause you know your bound to hit 4 trades in a row and be in profit.

Don't rush it. Once you figure it out you will have it for life.

Gold hasn't been good today, but this has to be expected.

This is what a bread and butter 1 entry per day would look like. Was in the last half an hour.

You ideally want to see a strong push into 1 direction and for price to pull back, learn this before doing anything else really as you need experience with nova to be able to thrive.

There is a trade some people would still enter after the one I've show but I wouldn't enter it because it didnt break the previous high in the move that managed to get the 2:1 and the signal line was above the zero level and would be more ideal to be below the zero level and heading up.

I've been having some issues using the 1min tf to implement this strategy (had some losses, maybe because of my entries as well)... even with the 15min tf. I just feel that with lower tf it's so easy to being caught in manipulation or news. Any recommendations? (For example not trading in main hours of the day or something like this?). I will be trying again with close attention to the rules.

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Do you check the calendar for red folder news? Just steer clear of market at those times. Very volitile moves. If you try trading the 15, wait for a signal on the 15min, then after you get your signal go down to the 1 minute chart and wait for the move in your direction. Gives you a better chance depending on how tight your stops are. I've been trading the 30min chart. With each time frame higher your patience needs to be higher. Sometimes you gotta let the trades play out. Pretty much every trade at some point I'm down a little bit for a while. Gotta let the market breathr and be patient.

It's called TDI. Helps with momentum.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Oh yes I know TDI lol, just not the TV version

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
I like to trade the london session but after 9am GMT not 8. Then will trade after 2pm GMT.

Nova works best when the market shows its hand, I like to see a high or low broken and wait to see what the moving averages are doing.

For me, the absolute best entries occur when the HTF has been in a pullback and is turning around. Hammering those periods on the M1 work a treat.

Over time you get a feel for where price is going to do and you can then start taking 5:1s or higher which massively help with any losses during the learning phase.

That is why I would say to take 1 or 2 entries per day but with an optimum entry (EMA flip - first pullback touches the ema - nova signal) which is usually a quick 2:1 to build your account.

I don't like being on charts all day but I know those with small accounts will want to trade all day and then take losses during the times they should have stayed out.

I also stay away from red folder news period.

Literally something like this (this was EU)

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
I had one and done! This is a easy setup for me today that I can see and I am going to look for those ones that you posted today with the big BOS and pullback. I saw it happen about 3pm New York time today 2 hours before close but I usually stop trading at noon New York time. I think my biggest challenge would be if Gold is trending overnight for 7-8 hours and the New York session starts. Is it better to see or wait a hour or 2 for a reversal? I think that's where i get chopped up the most!

Thank you again for the wonderful indicator my confidence has grown so much the last month or 2..

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Great entry!

I love that the indicator is working for you. I hate calling it that because it is literally a roadmap/confluence and does something much different than the common lagging ones BUT... yes what you are doing is right.

Just focus on the 1 main setup initially. With trading its screen time over anything else so this is just to aid you. I dont even need to use nova generally but its what helped me work out when the best entries are without being a sniper.

I don't like to trade the first hour of any session open and I like to see the market show its hand before I start entering anything so for me I prefer entering anything after 9am gmt time or 2pm gmt time but of course waiting for a setup.

Higher timeframe is key though, If I see the HTF is already extended then I will either not trade till the pullback occurs or I'll wait for a quick little counter trend trade for the pullback on the M1.

Once you can make say... 500 on 1 single trade then it's easy to be selective... I'm extremely protective of my capital no matter the amount but I wont let emotions enter me into dead trades which what is hard to teach. You're on the right track anyway... just find the 1 setup you like and hammer it even if its 3 times a week on M1! lol

2:1 will always make you profitable with the knowledge and experence of nova but after you get past the learning phase you'll be hitting 5:1 and not caring about the losses as you know another 5:1 is around the corner with nova.

Gold is best after the US session shows its hand. Often times, gold will trend to take liquidity and then will trend after which is why its vital to understand the instrument you are trading and what times it works because I cant provide that for everyone living in different timezones.

Glad its helping you... please keep posting here just to help those who haven't given it a real go.

Can you make the indicator with MTF capability in TradingView?

I think it might be quite easy if TV built-in 'timeframe' option applied^^

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
You just have to switch the timeframe

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
As I want to see the 15M NVI in one 1M timeframe chart^^

My idea is to load 2 NVIs, one for higher timeframe NVI and another one for current timeframe.

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
I have tried to do it but it will becomes very confusing because it won't show volume properly.

I.e if you put a H1 nvi on the M1 then the bars will be huge.

I'm adding some additional alerts to it today though so you can be alerted when the background colour changes. That way you will know when the 15m is starting to move in advance.

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Thanks for trying my idea. I think that one of the effective strategies is to judge the market bias as bearish when the NVI signal line is below the 0 line and the background color is red on the 15-minute chart, and trade according to the Nova signal on the 1-minute chart.

As you can see in the screenshot of mine, unchecking the 'Wait for timeframe closes' option makes indicator more visible I think ^^

Can you make the 'timeframe' option usable just for me please?

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
Appreciate your answer!
