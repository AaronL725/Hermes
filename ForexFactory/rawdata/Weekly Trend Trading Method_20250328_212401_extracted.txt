Hello everyone. I would just like to say that I've learned so much from FF, and I'm grateful to have learned from the FF community. I work full time during the day, and I have a family also. The only time that I have to trade is when I get home from work. I've tried several short term strategies, but I wound up losing more than I made. I was determined to find a method that was profitable and that didn't require several hours in front of my computer. I developed this method based on peterM's 5/8 ma cross method and DubaiTrader's slope direction method. This is a long term trading method and was not designed for scalping. This method is still in its early stages of development so bare with me. I've done some visual backtests across several pairs with this method and was amazed at the results. The sweet thing about this method is that I only have to check my computer once a day. Ok, let's get down to business. Pairs: Any Time frame: Weekly/Daily Tools: 1) rsi 8 set level to 50 2) macd (12,26,9) set level to 0 3) slope indicator set one at 15,3,0 and the other at 30,3,0 4) Ma colored indicator set to 50,0 or a 50sma set to close 5) Monthly pivot indicator (page 5 post #75) 6) Trend lines 7) 2MA crossover indicator settings: 5ema close and 8ema open. cross up symbol 233 cross down symbol 234 (modified version page 19 post 271) 8) Fractals indicator Your weekly and daily charts should look like these: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Before we make an entry, we must get a valid signal. There are two valid signals. The first one is the conservative valid signal and the second one is the aggressive valid signal. We'll start with the conservative signal first. Conservative Signal: 2MA cross indicator appears on the weekly or daily chart, both slope indicators must be the same color, the rsi is above/below the 50 line, and the macd signal bar is above/below the signal line. All these conditions must be met at the close of the weekly or daily candle. Here's an example of a long conservative valid signal (red horizontal line). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's an example of a short conservative valid signal (red horizontal line). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Aggressive valid signal: 2MA crossover signal appears on the daily or weekly chart, the 15 slope indicator's color is different from the 30 slope indicator's color, the rsi is above/below the 50 line, and the macd bar is above/below, close to, or touching the signal line. These condition's must be met at the close of the daily or weekly candle. Here's an example of a long aggressive valid signal(red horizontal line).

The first thing to do is pull up a weekly chart(s) and place trend lines in the direction of the trend. Now check the chart for a valid signal. If one is not present, then drop down to the daily chart to see if one has appeared. If a signal is not present there either, then go to another pair. If you have a valid signal on a weekly chart, place a buy stop at the high of that candle. Here's an example of a long conservative valid signal on this eurjpy weekly chart(red horizontal line).

Ok I must leave right now for family time. I'll be back later. Stay tuned.

This combo signals some entries as good as a commercial system I've been using! Good work! Thanks, Suzanne

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Given this system is on such large TF's ....The results might take a while to come in.... but you have my attention Mr. lgtj. Look forward to seeing all the details of this, similar to my current setup as well SunSue. Good Job!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Ok, I'm back. Here's another example on this usdcad daily chart of a conservative valid entry. Notice that the candle marked with the yellow line is not a valid signal because the rsi is on the 50 line and not above it. The candle marked with the red line is the valid signal candle. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Now for the aggressive entries , the rules are a little different. Instead of taking the entry on the chart which gave you the signal, you will drop down to the next chart to take your entry. Entries will only be taken on the 4hr, daily, or weekly charts. For the next example, I will use the audusd daily chart for the aggressive valid signal, and the 4hr chart for the aggressive entry. On the daily chart, the candle marked with the red line is the aggressive signal, and the one with the yellow line is the conservative signal. On the 4hr chart, the first red arrow is the candle that closed and completed the daily candle which gave the aggressive signal. The second red arrow is the candle that closed and completed the daily candle that gave the conservative signal. Before an entry can be taken, make sure that the conservative valid signal is already in place on the 4hr chart. If it is, place a buy stop at the high of the last candle of the daily candle. In this example it would be the candle with the first red arrow above it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I gotta go to bed now. I'll be back later to explain the stop loss and exit rules. Good nite. How does this method look so far?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi ltgj Looking good so far. Any profitable method is is good of course, particularly those that require less time in front of the PC.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hello Mrezoot. Yes the results might take a while, but the reward will be worth the wait. Remember the larger time frames are where the trends are established. If we stay with the trend we will win. Like I said in my first post, this method was not designed for scalping. I developed this method because there are a lot of us who can't sit in front of the monitor for several hours or for those who don't want to sit in front of the monitor for several hours. Because my broker is ibfx, I have to be at my computer at 8pm est to check my charts. That's it. So stick around and you'll see the power and simplicity of this method.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks. It gets better.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Now let's talk about stop loss. The stop loss will be totally up to you. I personally use the most recent fractal swing high/low because I want to give my trade plenty of room to breathe. Remember that your stops will be large sometimes because these trades are taken on the larger time frames. But this method was designed to get you into the market when there's volume and movement. I'll show you examples in a moment. Here are the stop loss options. Stop loss: 1) Recent fractal swing high/low 2) Previous day's high/low 3) Above/ below nearest s&amp;r level 4) Above/below trend line It's totally up to you. I'll use gbpusd daily chart for this example. The candles marked with red lines are valid signal candles. The red arrows are your stop loss options. Look at how the market moved after the valid signals were given. Price never came close to the stop loss areas. This won't be the case all of the time, but most of the time price will go in your favor without going near your stop. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #17 ---
First of all thanks a lot for the method. Can you quantify and tell us what kind of results should be expected? (Pips per day or per week I mean). Thanks!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
which one of stoploose you prefer to use

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I missed the purpose of the 50 SMA . . . Thanks!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Let's talk about targets. Again it's totally up to you. Personally, my target is 1:1 RR. You could go for more, but 1:1 RR is ideal for this method. Especially, when you're trading with several pairs. I monitor 13 or 14 pairs with this method. I also use my fib tool to plot my entry, exit, and stop loss. Fib levels and descriptions: 1) 0, ENTRY @ %$ 2) .5, 50.0 @ %$ 3) 1, STOP LOSS @ %$ 4) -.5, 1/2 TP1 5) -1, TP1 @ %$ 6) -2, TP2 @ %$ Take Profit Options: 1) 1:1 RR 2) s&amp;r level 3) Trend line 4) Fixed target Here's an example of the entire system at work. This chart is a long example on the gbpusd daily chart. This method gave a valid signal to go long just before the big move north. The red line is on the signal candle, and the red arrows are your target options. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I originally thought your instructions here meant that all these conditions must be met on the same day the 2MA cross indicator appears. However, it appears that all the conditions for the USD/CAD Short signal were not met until 2 days after the 2MA cross indicator signaled a trade. So, does the 2MA cross indicator just alert you to start looking for the other conditions on that day or later? If so, how many days later would you still consider the 2MA signal valid? For example, if the 2MA signal appeared, and it took several days for the other conditions to appear, do you still consider it a valid trade?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Here's a short example on gbpusd daily. The red line is on the signal candle and the red arrows are your target options. This method gave a valid signal before the big move south. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Here's a live trade example that I'm currently in on usdjpy daily. The red arrows are my target options. The candle with the yellow line on it is not a valid signal because the rsi is not above the 50 line. The candle with the red line is the valid signal candle. I'm currently +100 pips on this trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I don't know the answer to that because it depends on the pairs that you're trading and how many positions that you take and close in profit. I will say this though, earlier this week I had five trades open, and I was over 1100 pips in profit thursday nite. The pairs were gbpusd long, gbpchf long, usdjpy long(currently over 100 pips), gbpjpy long, and eurgbp short.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
The 50sma isn't really needed, but I like to use it to see how price reacts to it. I also use it to give me an idea of the overall trend. It's up to you.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Obviously it depends on how many positions someone has. I was asking about how many pips/per lot/per pair/per week (or per day). Just an average if you can give me. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Good question. All of the conditions do not have to be met on the same day. If all the conditions are met on the same candle, get ready to make some money. When the 2ma cross indicator gives a signal, that's when you start to look for a valid signal. If it takes several days for the other conditions to be met, I would look at the macd, rsi, s&amp;r levels, trend lines, and price action before taking a trade. Let's look at the long signal given on usdcad daily. The 2ma cross indi gave a signal on 10/20/09(yellow line). The other conditons were met three days later on 10/23/09(red line). According to the rules, this is a conservative valid signal, but look at all of the red arrows. There's too much resistance for my liking. Although I have a valid signal, I would not take this trade. Better safe than sorry. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Like I stated in my first post, this method is in its early stages of development. I really don't know the answer to your question. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Here's an example of this method on the audusd weekly chart. This method gave a valid signal on one candle, but look at the results. The red line is on the signal candle and the red arrows are your target options. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here's a trade that I plan to take next week. The yellow line is the aggressive signal and the red line is the conservative signal. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks for your response . . . I look forward to giving the strategy a "test drive".

--- 帖子 #33 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
System looks good, can't wait to set it up. Any chance you could upload the MACD you are using as I cannot seem to replicate visually with any of those I have. Thanks

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I prefer to use the recent fractal swing high/low.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hello again Lgtj! Good looking chats so far...was just curious... The lines you are using for your "approx" SL and TP...is that an Indi or are you plotting those yourself? Seems REALLY useful for this method in getting a gauge on your headroom needed for trades to run. If it is an indi it would be awesome to have in post #1 er..#2.... Either way...looking great so far! Can't wait to get some feeds Mon. Keep up the great work!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
No worries! Let's find out together. I will follow your method and I will let you know the results!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I have been reviewing the charts and your examples of your fib. SL-TP and decided to take a stab at plotting my own. Are these in the general right areas? (I understand that the entry is not signaled yet, just seeing if the levels are in the vicinity of your expected profits?) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Sure. Here's the macd indicator. Attached File(s) MACD2CHistg.ex4 5 KB | 624 downloads

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I plot those lines myself with my fib tool. Go to page 2 and read post 20 for the settings. The fib tool is located on your mt4 platform just above your chart.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thank you lgtj! I had gone over post #20 concerning SL/TP but was confused w/ the "$%" settings...another look @ them and its strait now! THANK YOU! The tool ended up being easier to use then I expected... Disregard the previous levels post. I have them matching how yours are drawn now.....

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I haven't seen anything in your trade directions regarding the ATM Pure MA Color indicator. What purpose does it serve?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Quote: I believe this is the indi in question. The ATM pure MA is his 50 sma close. Hope I have this right for you...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hello Mrezoot. You're correct.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
It's a colored 50sma. When you look at the charts that I've posted, you'll see how price reacts to it and how the colors reacts to price.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thanks to both of you.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi lg, very interesting thread so far ,and I love the simplicity of taking a trade(almost mechanical).... I am interested in which trades you would pick for the start of this week 26th Oct ? I have looked closely and have considered many,I wonder if you would pick similar. I am in australia so am up and about early,.What time do you commence trading??

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hello lotv and welcome to this thread. So far eurjpy weekly chart looks good. I've placed a buy stop at the high of the previous candle. The candle with the red line is the conservative valid signal candle. I live in Florida, and my trading starts at 8:00 pm est. Currently it's 2:09am in the morning, and I have to go to work in a few hours. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #50 ---
If there are any more questions or comments, please post them. I'll respond later on today. I have to go back to bed now.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
When reviewing over the weekend I noticed that signal setup in the EURJPY and was all over that today! LOL! I thought that I might be getting into it a little early so I opted for a BuyStop as well (I think mine is actually a little higher than yours 20-30 pips) None the less, I was still happy to see that it was a valid signal on your end as well! Looks like this system is gonna work well for my trading time frame! We'll see how it unfolds....thanks again lg!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I want to show you guys one more thing. Look at these daily charts. The red lines are on the most recent 2ma cross signal alert. Would these be considered as valid signals? If so, why? If not, why not? I want you all to know what to look for. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #53 ---
By the way, I closed my long position on usdjpy just below my first target option(red arrow) for 109 pips. Price was rejected at that resistance level. But it was a good trade anyway. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #54 ---
with regard to which of the 2 charts is right or wrong (post 52) I think the north chart is not a trade (both slopes not same colour) The southern chart I deem to be correct (all lined up). Incidentally lg, I am 12 hours ahead of you,(do you want to know what the future holds??lol )

--- 帖子 #55 ---
If I understand the entry rules, neither of those would be valid due to the MACD not crossing in the correct direction. (Red and Green MACD bars still to distant from white line) In addition, neither of the charts have confirmation from the second "Slope" indi. I assume I will be corrected if I am wrong...only AFTER a few more take a stab... right Lg?? LOL! :nerd:

--- 帖子 #56 ---
MACD has not crossed the signal line in either chart, and the slope indicators are not the same color. Therefore, they are not yet valid conservative signals.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
You guys gave good answers, and you were partially correct. The answer is both are not valid signals. Why? On both of the charts the 2ma crossover appeared, the 15 slope indicator was different than the 30 slope indicator(aggressive valid signal which is ok), the rsi is on the correct side of the 50 line, BUT there is too much space between the macd bars and the signal lines on both charts. Also the macd signal lines aren't going in the right direction yet. The trade is still developing for us. The sweet thing about this method is that we don't go to the trade, but the trade comes to us if we're patient enough to wait. But I'm glad you guys are paying attention to the signals. Great job!!!! I'll post more trivia charts for you later. I'm at work right now, and I'll pop in from time to time to answer any questions that you might have.

Very good, my man. However, having lived near the Napa Valley for most of my life, I must correct an error on your part . . . I thought everyone knew the best wines in the world come from the Napa Valley. But, I'm not a stubborn man . . . if you were to drop by with a sampling of Western Australia's finest, I'd be more than glad to share a "noggin" with you.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hello fellow traders. I just wanted to show you a trade that gave a valid signal, but I chose not to take the trade. The valid signal actually worked out. The signal appeared on the usdcad daily chart. The 2ma crossover indicator appeared on 10/20/09(red line). The other conditions were met on 10/23/09(yellow line). The reason I didn't take this long trade was because there was too much resistance in the area(red arrows) for price to be rejected. Plus the upper trend line of my downtrend channel is just above the resistance line 1.0581. If I had entered this trade at 1.0543 with take profit at 1.0682, I would've made 139 pips on this trade. That's ok, there will be more trades in the near future. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Took a few notes as to why or why not... GBPUSD = No, The 2nd confirmation slope is not matching, Red MACD bar needs to be BELOW the white line, RSI is resting...not crossed GBPCHF = No, This on does have some curious qualities though... I believe that it is approaching the resistance for the channel, as well your MACD did not "eclipse", it sort of rebounded off of itself. To boot...2nd slope is not confirming. NZDUSD = Yes, This to me looks very valid. Matching slopes, Red MACD below white. Kinda bad eyes on my part but it also looks like the RSI is about to cross if not already a little. Looks almost text book to me... AUDUSD = All I can say about this one is "I Hope"....I'm in it...LMAO!! Looked perfect to me. Keeping my eye on that resistance though.. I believe I jumped the gun a little getting in, but so far it's +35 pips EURGBP = Tricky..... My vote is on "NO". With it showing some respect for the .90 region I would be afraid of the turnaround. Although MACD and RSI agree, still waiting on confirmation 2nd slope indi. I can see why it may end up being valid...but I personally would not take this one! Curious to see the results and your opinion...all I know is my AUDUSD better be right! LOL!! Thanks again lg, the daily quizes really help sink the setup in... (Whoh...my High School Math Teacher better not see me compliment somebody on daily quizes!) LMAO!!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Lgtj, this system looks brilliant so far I will be backtesting it this week when I can, I am using Fx Pro metatrader 4 and for some reason all the signals that you just got a few hours ago do not show up on my charts, infact my 4hour chart on EUR/USD looks different from yours slightly I'm not sure why. Which version of MT4 do you use and I can transfer to that to do some backtesting across the pairs you use. I've been using a similar system which uses the trend slope indicator macd and 2EMA indicator on the 5minute timeframe but want to slow down on my trading so I have more time to backtest the system and spend time with the family, so your idea is great. A good mixture of a mechanical system and common sense using trendlines e.c.t to not just blindly take each trade. Great stuff, good luck, am looking forward to testing this system.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Welcome to this thread kaaea. Ibfx is my broker, and I developed this method for people just like you and I who have a life but don't want to spend the majority of the time in front of a computer. Thanks for your comments, and I'll be looking forward to your input.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hello Mrezoot. I'm impressed with your analysis of these charts. Here are the answers. Gbpusd - Both slopes don't have to match. As long as the 15 slope indicator is the correct color(Aggressive valid signal) it's ok. The rest of your answer is correct. Gbpchf - The 15 slope indicator is the wrong color and the rest of your answer is correct. Nzdusd - Not a valid signal because the rsi didn't cross the 50 line, but all of the other signals are ok. It was almost a text book valid signal. Audusd - Not a valid signal because the rsi did not cross the 50 line and there's a support level at .9139 that the previous candle bounced off of and closed above it. If price had closed below it, then maybe the rsi would've crossed below the 50 line. You got in too early. Patience is the key to this method. Eurgbp - Great analysis. The 15 slope indicator is the wrong color. Great job. Let me give you a couple of pointers. When all of the indicators are showing different things, don't take the trade. It's a sign of consolidation or a ranging market. You don't want to get caught in those conditions. If you're not 100% sure about a signal, don't take the trade. Again, great job!!!!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thank you for your review Lg! Good to see that it IS as simple as I first thought. As I stated before, this is similar to the system I am using now in regards to patience being the primary component. My current system includes MACD+Stoch with B.B.40 over 10-pip Renko Bricks (I'm ol' skool C4 and Nitro thread LOL...Edgetrader all the way!!....ooop sry, don't think he left on good terms ) So seeing the MACD here was nice since i'm used to it. There are differences obviously, primarily time based, but finding a more reliable entry is always worth the wait! This method definitely helps get you away from the screen though! I have decided to run this system on it's own UK Alpari Demo while I keep my primary system to my US Alpari. I'll keep posted my ongoing results so we can keep reviews and possibly answer some questions before there asked. Look forward to bombin' some more quizes and stealin' some more pips with ya Lg! Keep up the good work!

Hello again, I am now using IBFX and all last nights setups match up just getting my eye used to the setups now, Mrezoot thanks for your analysis its helped identify where I'm right and wrong, looks like the aggresive trades turned out well for those who took them on Eur/Usd, Usd/Chf, well done. Happy trading all talk soon.

Just study my posts and look for the same set ups when you do your back tests, and the set ups will jump out at you. I'll continue to post valid set ups for all to see. I'm in profit now on my live account with eurusd and usdchf currently.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hello all! I had noticed that the indi posted in #2 was the weekly originally. Since nobody else seemed to throw up the flag on it I though maybe it was just my mistake so I went searching for an S/R indi that seemed to match your charts lgtj. I came across this one and seems to be working well for me. Seems pretty close to your levels. Auto Pivot 2 It is adjustable for Daily, Weekly, and Monthly S/R and Pivots. These indis seem to be kind of a preference of how the lines are drawn. If they are working, they all should be about the same, RIGHT?? ....so just giving ya'll another option that seems to be respectable. P.S. This is from another thread SOMEWHERE in the vast FF-ness!

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Keep an eye on gbpchf daily. We could possibly have a conservative valid signal if the candle closes as it looks on this chart. There's a 2ma crossover signal to go long, both slope indicators are blue, the macd bar has pulled away from the signal line, the rsi is above the 50 line, and if price closes above the monthly pivot point, enter long on this one. I have to wait another 2hrs and 15 min before this candle closes. If the above conditions are still in place, I'm entering this trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks for the pivot indicator, I forgot about putting that on. Gbp/chf looking good, will be around as the day closes in search for setups to eyeball. So far eyeballing the pairs you use on the weeklys seem to catch good 4-5month moves and are good mostly at catching the trend and missing out the choppy peroids in certain currencies. Am trying to get my hands on some more data as only have charts back a couple of years will keep you updated.

I have attached 2 charts that I am unsure of. The first is a Daily of the AUDCAD. (Today I decided to open a IBFX Demo account so I to could be on the same platform and pickup the same signals.) I opened all the charts and found THIS!!! Is there any explanation to why the feed would be so all over the place? I understand down on the 1m and even 5m seein some of that...BUT DAILY? Just wondering if yours is the same in that time or just a bad feed on my part. I've rebooted it 3x now and still no change in refresh..? Ok, the second is a chart of the GBPCHF. This is the signal that is forming you just gave warning of....However on my chart I do not have the 2nd confirmation slope in my favor? I can confirm slopes on 15 and 30, do yours remain true to post #1 settings still? Just curious. It looks like it will confirm on mine as well, but might be a bar behind..which on daily TF I would think might be kinda important...? That might just be the scalping in me talking...thats why i'm throwing it up for debate! What ya'll think? (Oh and the AUDUSD that I took to early is still riding a +40 @ the moment..and keeps looking better and better...Thanks again Lg!)

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Well strike question #2 LOL! As soon as the next bar formed it gave me the same confirmation! DWAM!!! Ok, but really...that AUDCAD is still just messed up!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
How it looks now... Got the 2nd confirmation... Keeping 1 eye open....

--- 帖子 #83 ---
This sounds like a great system, I'm also in the same shoes you are in. Working. Mu system so far is I trade I losse. I know if I could be at the screen all day I wold succeed. I've really got to try this system. I need to know how to convert the ex4 files to mq4 files or do I have to?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hello Scratch! Welcome! To let you know you don't have to convert anything. Simply copy the .ex4 file to your experts/indicators folder. Reboot and there ya go! Hope that helps!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks for the response. I'll play with it tomorrow have to go to bed now. I hate work.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Mrezoot, I put my candle differences on my previous platform down to the timeframe the broker was based. Looking at it so far, IBFX is true GMT where as my previous platform Fx Pro was GMT +2 so my 4hour candles and above where looking different! I wonder if thats why some 4 hour systems i've tried haven't worked so well i've been looking at a false chart in a matter of speaking. In regards to GBP/CHF looks like a setup to me now, the slopes are positive, macd above the line and rising and RSI + 50, price has run into the 50 Dsma after only testing it a few days ago it is more likely to break so a break of the days high would qualify as a confirmed signal if i'm right...please correct me if I'm wrong i may be looking at the setups slightly wrong?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hello fellow traders, I just got back from church. Give me a few minutes and I'll answer your questions.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
That's why I picked these pairs because of their trending natures. You're welcome reference the indicator.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I don't have an answer for you reference the audcad chart. I haven't encountered that on any of my daily charts before. You'd have to call ibfx.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Looks like a text book set up to me.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
You are 100% correct. Great job!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
My buy stop is set at the high of the signal candle(red line). I'm going for 1:1 TP1 level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I hope this trade works out for you. According to my chart, price didn't close below that support level(.9139) yet. The rsi is on the 50 line and not below it yet. Remember, audusd is in a strong uptrend (look at your weekly chart). The rsi is showing us that strength is still to the upside. I'm waiting for a closed daily candle below support and a cross below the 50 line on the rsi. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thanks good to know i've got my eye in for these, i'll start by testing the conservative signals on weekly charts and then dailies. I will leave the aggressive signals till last as their frequency is higher making it probable that they have a lower win rate and return.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
We have another conservative valid signal on nzdusd daily chart. Target should be the lower channel trendline area. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Welcome to this thread Scratch. This method was designed for you also. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to post them. Make sure you study my posts and the rules to get a good understanding of this method. You will do good over the long term with this method because it was designed to catch the weekly trends.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Another tip. Before taking a trade on the daily charts, make sure you check the weekly charts also to confirm the direction. Look at tonight's signals weekly and daily charts. The weekly confirms the daily. I love this method.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Actually, the aggressive signal is usually followed by a conservative signal. So in essence, you would already be several pips ahead of the game.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Ah ok i was looking at the aggressive signal as a more higher risk trade now I understand the way you look at it, thanks.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
An update on that AUDUSD position. Closed for +100 pips. Went for dinner and came back to this. The entry was VERY early as I noted earlier (KIDS DON'T TRY THAT AT HOME!) So I will now just see what the trade SHOULD have done, had I waited till my signals came.... No Need for Greed ....BANKED! Thanks for looking out Lg!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
You were fortunate this time. Looks like we might have a valid signal tomorrow on this pair. We'll see.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Please correct me if I am wrong Lg! According to my chart posted above, (AUDUSD) I am receiving the signals to go short. Is that being viewed correctly on my part? Or would you still wait for the close below the support level @ .9140? Just trying to figure out what your discretion on this one was? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Yes, you received a signal to go short according to all of the other indicators except for the rsi. I've seen price flirt with the rsi 50 line several times and then continue in it's original direction instead of changing directions. I just looked at audusd, and it broke that support line, and the rsi is under the 50 line now. If it closes like that tonite, then we would have a valid signal, but price is approaching the lower trend line of my weekly channel. I'll have to see how price will react to that trend line. Although the trade worked out for you, I'd rather be safe then sorry. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Right you were Lg! Scooted my buy stop just above the pivot, she took it and ran! Simple but Genius! Thank You AGAIN!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
You're welcome. If you'll just be patient, you will be rewarded. Let's see how far north it will go.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Here are my trade results for this week's valid signals. Eurusd target was hit for 120 pips. Entry was 1.4854, and the target was 1.4734. Nzdusd target was hit for 107 pips. Entry was .7409, and the target was .7302. Gbpchf is currently +100 pips and running. I opened two positions on Usdchf and is currently at +120 pips. All of these trades were made on my live account. Oh happy day!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thanks for the heads up on Nzd/Usd , and Gbp/Chf earlier both running nicely now, Nzd/Usd just hit my target for me near that lower trendline and the 50sma. I have a question about the aggressive trades, do you take them from the timeframe that you see them on or do you go down a timeframe and wait for a signal on there to confirm, for example, a short aggressive signal occurs on £-$ on dailies, would i take it on dailies break of low, or take it on break of 4hour bar, or wait for a 4hour signal arrow? Thanks

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Congrats on your first win with this method. Reference the aggressive entries, if your signal is on the daily chart, drop down to the 4hr chart and place your stop order at the high/low of the last 4hr candle of the daily signal candle. But make sure that the 4hr chart is already going in the right direction. Look at my previous post with eurusd and usdchf aggressive entry examples(post #65).

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Ok thank you very much, helps alot with the backtesting as wasn't sure. So far results are looking good I've been backtesting on cable, although personally for me some trades present too much risk as I'm not yet trading on a Fx account I'm spreadbetting, I presume you are using a Fx account?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Yes. I have a fx account.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Can you give me your Template? Thanks and best regards

Hello attached are the indicators that you will need and the template I use. You shouldn't need to setup the indicators it should work in the template. However if it doesn't just look back through the thread for the appropriate settings. Happy trading

Thanks for this contribution. I don't know how to post a template.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Can you post a chart of a set up that looks like too much risk so that I can comment on it.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Eurgbp looks good on the daily chart. If it closes below the support level (.8996),I'm going short. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi lgtj, attached is an example of a trade on £-$ which is too much risk for me personally on my spreadbetting account, I'm sure its fine on an FX account as you have the ability to change lot sizes, I've always tried to risk a fixed % of my account per one trade not over / under exposing myself, otherwise as I've found out at times you can get lots of small wins and one big loss. What I meant by too risky was just that it's too far out of my personal money management rules for the moment until i have a larger account size to work with. The risk in this trade example is 602 pips excluding spread.

Beat me to it Mrezoot Good tutorial, trust your trades are going well.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Well I decided to follow this technique with the EUR/Usd. I'm in since 1.4873. I do not have a plan for taking profit as of yet because I figure when it's time for it to go back up the signals should be there. Am I correct? The rsi on the weekly is still above 50. Is this a bad sign?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thank you very much Kaaea! Yes the positions are turning out quite nice! The GBPCHF is @ +75 pips The USDCHF is @ +40 pips The EURGBP is @+57 pips (Got into this one WAY to early again...BAD zoot!) Trying to work on keeping my finger off the trigger.... I've gotten lucky the last 2 times so I won't test it again. Thank you again Kaaea, I hope it helps others!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Glad to hear on your positions, I am in GBP/CHF also, not in the EUR/GBP yet...yes seem you jumped the gun a tad on that one but your in profit for now, most people only learn when they get losses when jumping the gun. I must say you've been luckier than me in that department, and hope your luck continues. Let's see what setups arise in 15minutes time.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hello kaaea. I don't know anything about spread betting so I can't comment about the risk factor.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Glad to see that you're in profit, but you got to work on the patience.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi Lgtj, no problem it's something I have to sort out. So far tested £-$ from start of 2009, got 21 setups total this includes aggressive and conservative trades. Total risk is 8245pips, total return is 4535pips. 17wins, 4losses. Would prefer at least 50 setups on each pair though as a larger sample size will keep you posted where I'm at. Please note 2 of the losses had stops 650+ pips or greater the only 2 of their kind in the volatility at the start of the year so once I get a larger sample size I may dis include trades with 500+ pip stops or something we'll see.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Now we have a valid signal on audusd. Although it's close to the lower trend line, I believe that there is enough momentum to the downside to push through the trend line. We'll see. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #129 ---

--- 帖子 #130 ---
If you take every signal without paying attention to the trend line channel and s&amp;r levels, then one can lose more than they win. When you read my posts, you'll notice that I wait for valid signals, s&amp;r levels to be broken, and weekly trend confirmation before I take a trade. Besides there is no way that I would have 500+ pips at risk unless I was absolutely sure about the trade. A risk that large would occur on the weekly time frame only. What time frame did you research?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Please read post 20 and 22 on page 2 about target or take profit options. Eurusd is in an uptrend. Right now price is retracing, but we don't know for how long. The eurusd short trade that I took was a counter trend trade. So it is very important that you set a take profit level. Price can go against you at anytime without warning and hit your stop loss.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hello, I researched those results from the daily timeframe and from using the 4hour for the aggressive setups. I agree that 500pips + is large risk (these trades only occured during the volatility at the start of the year) I just thought i'd share these initial results so far, once I complete this first phase I will go through the trades using trendlines and s&amp;r ... but if the system looks great without those I will have confidence that trendlines and s&amp;r would make it even better. Thanks for your advice and repeated insights stops me from forgetting certain things that I might otherwise would. I will review the small exam you left tomorrow after some well needed sleep. Bye for now

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi, guys! I have been following this method and I like it so here is my analysis of your charts. USDJPY: no trade, signal lines do not have the same color, not in the same direction, plus monthly pivot line and support are about the same level, so it might be a quite strong support in there GBPJPY: no trade, signal lines are different color and do not line up in the same directions, rsi above 50, price sitting on the support, macd should be below the line EURJPY: trade, valid signal, signal lines are the same color and the same direction, macd below line and falling, rsi below 50, target monthly pivot AUDJPY: trade, the same conditions are met as for previous EURJPY, however I would like to see close below mR1 or enter a trade below that line NZD JPY: trade, the same as above with AUDJPY, however here it looks like it is going to bounce of the monthly pivot and go up towards that blue support channel line and bounce back down. let me know... if the analysis are OK. Great system, easy to follow and doesn't take too much time.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
See ya later and get some sleep Kaaea. I'm tired also and have to get some sleep. Gotta go to work in the morning.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hello lostfx and welcome to this thread. I'm glad you like this method. Give me a moment while I review your analysis.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Great job lostfx. Here are the answers. Usdjpy - Correct no trade, but the signal lines don't have to be the same color(aggressive signal). Gbpjpy - Correct no trade, Except that signal lines can be different(aggressive signal). Eurjpy - Correct Audjpy - Correct Nzdjpy - Correct. I don't think that this pair is going to go down that much further because it is in a strong uptrend (look at the weekly chart). I think it's retracing for now and will resume its upward trend. We'll see what happens. Great job!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Although audjpy, eurjpy, and nzdjpy gave valid signals tonite, I didn't place trades for these pairs because the signal candles were too long for me.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hello, lgtj! Thanks for the prompt answer. I'm glad that I'm on the right track. I have one question for you. Let's say on day1 you get a signal and you enter a trade. On the second day you close for profit. On the third day it may continue further in the same direction and all signals are still valid. Will you open again a new trade? In other words for how long the initial signal is valid for?

--- 帖子 #139 ---
One more indicator that I'm using with your system is in10tion news reader 0.97. Iy gives very nice overview of the pair plus it shows the news.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Good question. I'm still working on a re-entry method. If you take a trade, and it's with the trend, let it ride with the trend. If the trade is a counter trend trade, then take profit at your predetermined level. The signals that were given this week were primarily counter trend signals. For example the nzdusd short trade that I took was a counter trend trade. Although price went much further than my 107 pip target, I will not re-enter if price continues south. I would wait for a retracement, a rejection of the retracement, and another valid signal to go short. I hope I answered your question.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Thanks.

I'm really sleepy now. We'll chat tomorrow.

Usdchf - 1st position reached its 76 pip target. Entry was 1.0201 &amp; target was 1.0277. The second position is still running. Gbpchf - Currently +120 pips Eurgbp - Sell stop just recently filled. Let's see what happens. So far so good. I'll keep you posted.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I was looking at my charts today, and I noticed a lot of bounces at certain s&amp;r levels. It is very important that you consider where the s&amp;r levels are before you take a trade. The colored 50sma on my charts also acts as support and resistance and could be used as a target option too. Look at how price respected these levels. This is why trend lines, pivot points, and s&amp;r levels are apart of this method. Look at these charts and notice where I put the red arrows.

Gbpusd daily looks good to me. Looks like we might have a trend change. Look at the daily and weekly charts. On the daily, price broke through the upper trend line and resistance level. Then it came back down through the upper trend line to test the 50sma and was rejected. Then price broke back up through the upper trend line and resistance level again. If this current candle closes above the resistance level, I'm going long on this one. My target will be at the next resistance level (red arrow).

Correction on Usdchf . The first position's target was not hit yet. I had the wrong target written down. Both positions are currently in profit right now. Currently +90 pips in profit. Gbpchf - Currently +120 pips. Eurgbp - Price has stalled between resistance level .8996 and the pivot point .8857. Gbpusd - Buy stop has not been filled yet. Maybe next week, we'll see. I'm currently +200 pips in profit. Not bad.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Ended up cutting the GBPCHF for +100 pips. Gonna sit and see where yours goes Lg! I was happy none the less! Thanks again Lg!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Congrats. I'm still holding mine until next week. We'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
A quick question Lg? In the case of the open GBPCHF position, would you have brought your SL up to breakeven or higher seeing it open over the weekend? Or would you still keep your SL intact from original entry? Just curious of any precautionary actions you might take for positions open over the weekend, or if you have a method of moving the SL ever? Thanks again and have a great weekend guys!

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I kept my sl in its original position. Currently, I don't have a method for moving my stops to breakeven. As long as my trades are going in the right direction, my targets will most likely be hit.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi, lgtj! I see your system as a very good entry system once you see the big picture and opportunities it offers. I definitelly agree that one has to be patient and filter out the good trades. It can't be traded blindly. So far I made 3 trades and 2 of them generated nice profit and one is still undergoing - EurGbp. lostfx

--- 帖子 #155 ---
You're 100% correct. You can't trade every signal blindly. If you're willing to wait for everything to match, you will be rewarded. I'm glad to hear that you're profiting from this method.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Well done with your week folks, thanks for sharing this method lgtj, have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Keep an eye on usdjpy when the markets open tomorrow. Look at this chart. Notice that all of the signals are there to go short except for the 2ma cross signal. If the 2ma cross signal appears on this candle(red line) tomorrow, then we would have all of the signals on one candle. This means that there should be a strong move south. I'm going short on this pair if the 2ma cross appears. Also note that price broke north through the pivot point and the trend line. Then price went up to resistance level 92.49 and was rejected. Then price went south after the rejection and broke through two trend lines, the 50sma, the pivot point(red arrow), and the candle closed under all those levels. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Lgtj Your system looks good. I am not new to trading and like most frinding time to trade is the major issuie. Work and family already take up a lot.. add hours in front of a screen and things can get messy with the wife. Ayway thanks for your efforts here I know that this requires some considerable effort from yourself to keep the thread on track. I have a question regarding the USDJPY chart which I hope does not cone across as a stupid question. You have said that you are waiting for the 2MA cross signal, can you please explain how the signal works? as it apperas that the MA's have crossed what is the reason to wait for the signal and how is the signal differnt than the cross.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi there...I wanted to know why you use the 2ma cross over and not 3ma cross? just curious thanks

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hello Duke and welcome to this thread. Firstly, this method was created for people just like you who have a life and who wants to trade around that life. Secondly, no question is stupid on this thread. I'm here to help everyone understand this method. Now to answer your question about the 2ma crossover indicator. This core of this method is the 2ma crossover indicator. I just added some filters to confirm the cross and the trend. Although you can see we have a strong signal to go short on usdjpy with the other indicators, the 2ma cross indicator will confirm what the other indicators are showing us and vice versa. I hope I answered your question.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hello Future and welcome to this thread. I use the 2ma instead of the 3ma because the 2ma cross will get you into a trade much earlier than a 3ma cross. I've tried several 3ma cross strategies before and usually you'll get a signal to enter a trade after the initial move has already gone several 100 pips. But this method was designed to get you into a trade at the beginning of the move and not after a retracement of the move like the 3ma cross.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Would you see a good stop loss at 90.02 and target at around 88.00 for this one? Reason I am asking, is because I have problems with these, don't really know when to take profit and usually loose on my SL.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
sorry if I am asking too many questions but you use this 2*2 ma cross over exclusively on daily/weekly charts? Also can you please put ur template for us to use. when making a trade u go solely of what daily says or weekly says? Thanks lgtj

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Here is the template.... lostfx

--- 帖子 #166 ---
You will be using the Weekly and Daily to establish your trends and S/R. Then drop down to 4H to get optimal entry. Check out post #10 for a little more details in this.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Thanks Mrezoot. I saw a post by ljtj saying he will wait for usdjpy on daily to get the 2 ma crossover but if you see the 4hr chart of usdjpy, the slopes 15 &amp; 30 have same color, we have 2ma crossove arrow and rsi is below 50. is this a good setup on 4hr or u will wait for daily to confirm it? thanks

--- 帖子 #168 ---
LOL! I will just start by saying that I am the WRONG person to be asking if it's early enough to get in...LMAO!! I have been working on having a lighter trigger finger Lg! If I was to say, I imagine he will tell you to wait for the daily. .....I will

--- 帖子 #169 ---
"I" will be waiting on the daily...not that I am telling you to!!' little misleading on that last comment. I am by no means calling anything here....thats Lg's job! LOL!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Please re-read posts #16,20,22, &amp; 23 about stop loss and take profit options.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Yes, I use the 2ma crossover indicator for the daily and weekly charts only. Trades are only taken if weekly or daily gives a valid signal.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
You drop down to the 4hr chart only if you get an aggressive valid signal on the daily chart.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Yes, you wait for confirmation on the daily chart not the 4hr chart.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
You're correct. Wait for the daily!

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I will say this again. Patience is the key to this method. If you will wait for the valid signals, you will be rewarded. Don't go to the trade, let the trade come to you. Maybe you didn't notice this, but several valid signals were given last week. There will be many more to come this week and the week after that. There's no need to rush because you'll have several signals per week. Beeeeeee Patient!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi lgtj, Thanks for ur replies. I have questions regarding the chart. Did you take the long around 89.**? I am asking cause we have rsi above 50 and then 2ma crossover, but the slopes dont have the same color all the way till about 92(i think) can you please tell thanks

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I think that you are referring to the candle with the yellow line on it. That candle was not a valid signal candle because the rsi was not above the 50 line. If the rsi was above the 50 line, then it would have been a aggressive valid signal. Re-read posts #4 and #10 about aggressive valid signals and entries. Entry was taken at 90.97.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
ya just saw the yellow line and rsi is barely above 50. if you look at the red line after the yellow line, we have rsi above 50 and then the 2ma crossover but no same color on the slope line. In this case do you go to the 4hr chart and see if the conservative signals are meet? (all 3- 2ma crossover, rsi above 50 and color same for slopes)? thanks

--- 帖子 #179 ---
The slopes are the same color on the candle with the red line. The slopes are different on the candle with the yellow line. If the candle with the red line had a blue 15 slope and a red 30 slope, then you would drop down to the 4hr and confirm that the conservative signals are already in place.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Look at this eurjpy daily chart. Is this a valid signal? 1) If so, why? 2) If not, why not? 3) Would you take the trade? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi lgtj, I would not take this trade as it closed directly into 2 trend lines, and the bars are rather large meaning alot of risk placing stop at highs.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
You're 100% correct. This is a conservative valid signal. Although you have a valid signal, you don't just blindly take this trade because there's a lot of confluence below price(trend lines and pivot point). Also, that candle is too long as you pointed out kaaea. When I see extra long candles, most of the time there will be a retracement and some ranging before price begins to move again. Stay away from extra long candles!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
i would take the short trade cause we have the 2ma crossover, slope color same and then rsi below 50. Please confirm if I am correct Also it touches the monthly R2 and if we take it there at R2 its 137.55 and by the time the long candles are drawn the price i at 132.45 so its almost 500 pips gain

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hello all and a happy Sun. night opening! I'm really glad you posted this Lg! I was looking @ it this weekend.... The Support has been tested SEVERAL times and it is closing in. While it did have a wicked retrace, likely just news and was continuing path south...hmmmm My vote is no as of now.... Curious to see some other inputs on this... Maybe going short if it DOES break the support...however, it looks like its nugged past a few times..???? hmmm for SURE....

Here's another one. Look at this audjpy daily chart. On 10/28/09, we got a conservative valid signal(red line), but price bounced off of that resistance level and closed above it the next day. Then price penetrated through that resistance level the next day and closed below it. 1) Would this still be a valid signal? 2) Would you take this trade? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #186 ---
You're 100% correct. No trade.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
AUD/JPY I would take a trade just because everything is in place and close is below that support line, but as in first case we have too long candles. Too much risk is involved.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Yes, it's a valid signal because all of the signals agree, but it's not recommended that you take this trade because price did not break and close below the trend lines and pivot point. Also that candle is too long. Price respects trend lines and s&amp;r levels. So, we don't know how price is going to respond at these levels.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
thanks lj...still learning but I like the simplicity of this method

--- 帖子 #190 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Yes, it's still a valid signal, but price is still above the 50sma and pivot point. Also, the lower trend line of the channel is not too far away, and the candle is extra long. Besides, audjpy is in a strong uptrend. With all of these facts, I would not take this trade. You're right about it being a very risky trade.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hey lg qq: what are these slope indicators? what do they signify and why use them only as 15 and 30?sorry if was asked before thanks

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I would not take AUD/JPY trade due to risk and sup levels being close. Just wondering lgtj did you take the weekly long on eur/jpy last week as it did trigger? or did i misunderstand what you where looking at. Thanks

--- 帖子 #194 ---
The slope indicators are used to confirm trend direction, that's all. I use these settings because they move with price action pretty good. If you change the settings you'll see for yourself.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Yes I did take the eurjpy trade and it triggered, but price was not ready to continue north yet. I closed the trade with a loss, but that's forex for you. You win some and you lose some.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Ok thanks, yea loosings all part of any system no matter how good it may be just got to keep at it without being fearful or greedy.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
lgtj what is your view on USD/JPY?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Well said!

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Ok The 2ma cross just appeared on my platform(red line). When this current candle closes(sunday candle), I'm going short on usdjpy. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I was checking my charts and look at what I saw. Gbpjpy daily is forming a conservative valid signal to go short. Price has bounced off of the upper trend line of the downtrend channel, and now it's forming a valid signal. I'm going to keep my eye on this one. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
lg, how many curriencies you trend with this method?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
13 pairs. They're posted on page 5 post #67. You can trade this method on any pair. Just be careful with the choppy pairs like eurchf.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
k thanks. Sorry if I am asking too many questions but in the above chart of gbpjpy, when the price is going up frmo 140 - gbpjpy, we didnt get an arrow for the 2ma crossover? if we could have caught that one...that would have been perfect

--- 帖子 #204 ---
sorry should have zommed out before asking u this question.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
The 2ma cross is on the previous candle which was on friday. The 2ma cross appeared today because with ibfx, the sunday candle is a continuation of the friday candle. The same thing happened with usdjpy. The rest of the indicators are confirming the 2ma crossover today. Please feel free to ask as many questions as needed. You're here to learn this method, and I'm here to teach you. Your questions are helping others who are reading this thread also.

Is that a possible buy signal on weekly usdcad? Everything seems right except for the RSI which is just on 50. Is this something that we should be watching?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I personally do not have any indication...yet Do you mind posting a shot of it.....I think my IBFX is still being weird. I still have quite a bit of space between my RSI and 50. I have a feeling that the monthly pivot (1.07920) will be a target before going long.. Just my thoughts...we'll see

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Good observation. Usdcad weekly is not quite ready yet because the rsi is riding on the 50 line(red arrows). But watch this pair from the daily charts. It looks like it is in retracement mode right now. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi lgtj, I have a quick question in regards to aggressive trade setups. If you get a EMA cross over signal to go long, and an aggressive signal sets up on the next daily bar i.e 15 / 30 slope indicators different, rsi and macd are setup. would you then go down to 4hour chart to find trade? Or can aggressive trades only be taken if all the indicators including the 2 EMA's setup on the same day? Thank you

--- 帖子 #212 ---
If the set up occurs on the same candle or if the 2ma appears first and then the 15 slope is different from the 30 slope with the rsi and macd set up on the next candle, then drop down to the 4hr chart and enter at the high of the last 4hr candle of that daily candle. The conservative or aggressive signals do not have to occur on the same candle.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
After a week of trial and error and Q&amp;A from tech., I'm throwing in the towel on IBFX. It went a little like.. , , , With no answers why there are HUGE gaps in my feed, I cannot even TRY! (see chart) It seems to be working GREAT for everybody else....so I will stick to my Alpari US and UK. I hope nobody else has this problem!

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Did you call ibfx about the problem?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
No I did not call... I assumed it being a demo that it wouldn't weigh very heavy with priority. I did search the F.A.Q. and through other forums w/ no such luck. Kinda aggravating but not a big problem. I only wanted to use IBFX so me and you would be in sync Lg. Been more of a hassle then help though..... My Alpari keeps me right there as well...within a few points @ least. Thanks for your concern though Lg!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Lgti, Looking at the NZUSD on a weekly chart and it looks like a short signal is forming. Then move to the daily chart and it looks like we have missed the bus.... Did you take this short? and do you treat the daily and weekly charts as differnt trades... will you short the NZUSD when a weekly signal appears even if the daily might start to look like a buy? thanks

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Would not take the trade because weekly and daily are not different trades. When weekly signal appears I would wait for the daily to confirm. I don't know if this is correct but that is what I would do. I think if the weekly and the daily are in sync then it would be perfect. This pair is in an uptrend, so must be very cautious. Loked back on the daily for signals and say one that would have been a short but actually went long. Check the weekly and it was not even near a signal. Perhaps the trick is make sure you have a signal on the daily then chec the weekly to make sure it is heading in the same direction. Still haven't taken the short on usdjpy and gbpjpy. Nervous. This is the first time I would do this live and I am very nervous about it. Low on funds. Does it usually go back up after the signals then go down again, like the pairs have done?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I couldn't have said it better myself! The answer to your question is that sometimes price will retrace after a valid signal is given. Although usdjpy and gbpjpy gave valid short signals, price went north on the next candle instead. Does this mean that it wasn't a good signal? Of course not. Look at the weekly charts for both of these pairs. What do you see? Both of these pairs are in a downtrend. So that's just more confirmation and reassurance to place your trades. Remember that this is a long term trading method and that there will be a lot of movement. Don't let fear prevent you from taking a trade because you'll never trade. Trade with the smallest lot size possible until you get more confidence in yourself and the system. You will lose sometimes, but that's a part of trading. Don't worry about it, there will be more trades ahead.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Yes I did take the initial short signal(red line on daily) for 107 pips because price was headed south towards the lower trend line of the channel on the daily chart. My target was just above the lower trend line. Although price continued to fall and broke through the channel, I'm waiting for a retracement and another valid signal to go short. You're correct about a short signal possibly forming on the weekly, but monitor the daily chart for your optimal entry. Look at these charts. I'm waiting for price to retrace and test the lower trend line(teal line) of the channel on the daily time frame. If this happens and price is rejected, then I'll be looking to go short again when the signal is given. Remember, this pair is still in a strong uptrend. Let's see what happens. Also, I don't treat the daily and weekly as different trades. I'm trading with the weekly trend as long as the daily and weekly are in agreement.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hey Lg, Are you still in that USDJPY? Looks like it finally falling! I'm only -66 pips now..which is a big improvment In it to win it!

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Well I'm still in it at -70 pips and rising. I wanted to see an example of a failed trade and I guess I'm seeing it now. Guess I had to enter it to see it, as per usual.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
My sell stop has not been triggered yet. I placed my sell stop at the close of the sunday candle at .89.67. I'm still waiting.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hey Scratch. Because price went against you initially does not mean that it is a failed trade. Be patient and wait to see what happens. Price is not going to always go your way at the beginning, but eventually it'll get there. If it goes too much against you for your liking, then close the trade and wait for another signal. It's that simple.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi all trust your weeks are going well. Got another question for you lgtj ... if you get a legitimate conservative signal how long would you wait for it to trigger as in my backtesting some trades i.e a short price would rally higher for 3 weeks then trigger you in and stop you out wondering if you have any guidelines for when you wouldnt take a legit trade. Thanks

--- 帖子 #225 ---
So is there any specific rules you have for Sundays? I noticed on the USDJPY (post#199) that all signs were there on Sun. night... Yet you waited until Mon to SellStop? Why? Do you simply wait for another bar to form? ..... for reassurance? Also...do you ever just place order, or do you always do BS/SS above/below previous candle to enter? Just curious how/why you dodged that one? Maybe it can help others have more optimal entry's....

--- 帖子 #226 ---
It depends on how close price is to an s&amp;r level. Could you post an example for me.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
The sunday candle, for ibfx, is an extension of the previous friday candle. Also the new weekly candle starts after the sunday candle closes. Besides, the sunday candle contains only two hours of price action. So I waited for the sunday candle to close, since it's an extension of the friday candle, to place my order. Some brokers don't have sunday candles on their platform such as fxdd. I don't know what BS/SS means, but I place my orders at the high/low of the signal candle.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi, heres an example of a trade on nzd-usd its a short trade and it doesnt trigger for many weeks also on the screen shot although you cant see it there was a long setup a week before this short setup, and the indicators didnt line up for 4 weeks would you still take that trade? Thanks

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hello lgtj, Thank you for starting this thread, I've been a casual follower of it for a while now. I don't trade time based charts, but find myself these days often referring to your setup when I want to see what the longer term trends are up to. You should see how your template looks on 25 pip renko bricks sometime. See my post here if you'd like to try it, only takes a few minutes to set up renko charts on mt4. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...5&amp;postcount=91 Keep up the great work guys... PS: I added this rsi candle indi etc set to your rsi specs, how does it look?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I would not take this trade because there is a support level just below that candle. Also looking at the previous candles, I saw a couple of 2ma cross signals, price really didn't move, and price was still above that support level. With all of those observations, I would not take a trade.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I like it. I'll give it a try. Thanks and welcome to this thread.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Here's the nzdusd chart that you posted earlier. Now that I'm home, I'm able to see the big picture. I placed two red lines on the chart. The second red line is the signal that you had a question about. Look between the two red lines and tell me what you see. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Buy Stop / Sell Stop sry... Ok so you place your Buy Stop and Sell Stop @ High/Low of signal day....Thanks!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
EURUSD just gave a buy signal on the daily chart but I'm not convinced of this one. The RSI is just a hair above 50 and one of the slopes is still red. I also think it will head down.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hello and welcome 45Fxguy! Just wanted to say that I also run along w/ the renko bars as well! I'm an ol' C4-turned-Nitro-turned-Recycling Bin thread trader who now adapts these (Lg) "Longer/Bigger" term views to weed out the other half of my trades! ( The LOSERS and FALSE SIGNALS ) So far this has been an amazing addition! Running each system on their own broker, I confirm Alpari US(renko) w/ Alpari UK(Weekly) Staying w/ the overall trend, I'll only put in when I have my renko signs AND it is in favored direction. (This also allows me to put in short-term trades when screen-time is available and long-term when not...or not desired... ) This has been an amazing filter for a system which I refused to let die w/ the thread that started my many amateur "light-bulb" moments. This has helped tremendously! Thank you again so much LG, and look forward to seeing your progress 45Fxguy! Many pips to all!

[quote=lgtj;3209897]Look at these daily charts. These are the most recent signals. Do we have any valid signals? If so, why? If not, why not? The only valid one I see is GBPJPY but I would not take this one because the overall trend is down. I have to go to work now. Man I hope this system works I hate work, I love this stuff. C'omon USDJPY,go go ..

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Ok the answer is none of the signals are valid signals. Why not? Eurusd - Too much space between the macd bar and signal line. Usdcad - The macd bar is above the signal line and the rsi is on the 50 line. Audusd - Too much space between the macd bar and signal line and the rsi is on the 50 line. Usdchf - Too much space between the macd bar and signal line. Gbpjpy - Too much space between the macd bar and signal line. Eurjpy - Way too much space between the macd bar and signal line.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi lgtj, looking at the chart between the 2 red lines i see a consolidation in price. Am just trying to find out how you would trade things like this, as there are multiple long and short signals one after the other and price going no where, would you have taken the first 2 setups? and when you see price chopping leave those trades running, as without hindsight you couldnt know that price was just going to chop around for a good 6 weeks. Thanks

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Good observation. Whenever you see the conditions that you described, stay away from that pair until there is movement again. You wouldn't have known that the market was going to be choppy after those signals, but if you pay attention to the s&amp;r levels, trend lines, and price action, you wouldn't take any trades. The answer to your question is no I would not have taken the first two signals. Look at this chart. The candles with the red lines are the ones that you are talking about. What do you see and tell me why do you think that I would not take these trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #244 ---
How much space should there be between the MACD and the signal bar?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
The macd bar should touch the signal line or about to touch it with hardly any space between them at all and the signal line has to be going in the direction of the trend. This is covered on the first page of this thread(aggressive valid signals post #4). The slopes on all of the pairs were showing aggressive signals.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I am still is usdjpy short and just received a buy signal. Getting very nervous.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Scratch, you did not get a valid buy signal. Just because the 2ma cross appeared does not mean that it's a valid signal. Please re-read the first page again about valid signals.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi, from what I see there is a trendline that you could draw on the lower highs from the start of the chart that intersect with the short setup, there are also pivot levels, do you take trades near pivot levels? or is it just the pivot point itself. But the long trade triggers at the end of the month and isn't near any pivot or trendline level as do the other 2 longs stopping you out 3 times. Not sure if this is correct or whether you will have multiple positions open on the same pair? Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
The reason I wouldn't have taken those trades is because they were not valid signals. All of the indicators did not match up. So no multiple trades would have been placed. Yes I take trades near pivot points only if a candle has closed above/below the pivot point and I have a valid signal. Also the long signal given towards the end of the month was not a valid signal. So no trade would have been placed.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi, lgtj! Can you please post more examples how you analyze from weekly down to 4 hours? So far all the trades that i did with your method turned to profit, but sometimes i'm not sure about it. I mean like that separation of macd and signal line, etc...

--- 帖子 #251 ---
The weekly chart can be used to see when a currency pair goes "on sale". The daily chart can be used to see if the buyers are on a "shopping spree". This doesn't sound sophisticated but it works. The white/black bars are daily bars and the green/red shaded areas are the weekly "bars". http://i944.photobucket.com/albums/a...n/usdjpy-3.gif The usdjpy was "on sale" at the beginning of the week and buyers flocked. Wednesday was the last day of the shopping spree as the sellers drove the buyers away. This week the buyers may come back for more. I apologize if I am speaking out of turn here.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Sure. I'm glad you're profiting from this method. If you're not sure about a possible set up, DO NOT place a trade. Post any set ups that you're unsure of, and I'll evaluate it for you.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
My question is that do you always look at weekly? I mean if there are opportunities on daily chart and all indicators line up and we are going in the direction of weekly trend, is there anything that would prevent you from taking the trade? Or do you always wait for weekly to give you a signal and the you switch to daily to enter a trade? I still do not use switching to 4 hour. Can you give more examples when and at which conditions would you switch from daily to 4H to enter trade? I read your post about aggressive entry, but do you consider it only as a optional entry or you always switch to it?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I go to the weekly chart to plot trend lines for trend direction. When valid signals are given on the daily time frame, I take trades on the daily time frame depending where the s&amp;r levels are. I don't take trades if price closes near an s&amp;r level, trend line, or 50sma because I don't know how price will react at those levels. I don't wait for the weekly to give a signal before I take a trade. I monitor the daily time frame and check the weekly for confirmation. But if there is a valid signal on the weekly, then I'll check the daily for confirmation. The aggressive entry is an optional entry only if you want to get into price action a little earlier. When I see an opportunity to enter early I always take it. I'll post more examples when they occur.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Thanks a lot. That explains lots of things....

Hi lg, can i make u a request. for the 2MA crossover arrows, can you please draw them closer to the candles. Sometimes I am missing the move because the arrows are drawn outside the window. Offcourse this is just a humble request as I dont know any programming or how to modify a indicator

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I'm not a programmer, and I don't know how to make that adjustment on this indicator. I just slide my chart down to check for the indicator's signal. Maybe one of the many programmer's on ff can fix this for us. I would sure appreciate it.

On 10/29/09 I posted that gbpusd daily gave a valid signal, and I placed a buy stop at the high of that signal candle. On 11/5/09, another valid signal was given on gbpusd daily, and I placed a buy stop at the high of that signal candle. I verified the trend by looking at the weekly chart before placing my orders.

Nzdusd - Looks like a good aggressive valid signal if it closes above the resistance level and the lower trend line. Personally, I might wait for the conservative valid signal. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Usdcad - There are two trend lines that haven't been broken, a support level just below them, and the candle is too long. I'll pass on this one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Usdjpy - Stay away from usdjpy. It's in consolidation right now. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Gbpjpy - I was watching this pair, and I was hoping that this candle would close above the upper trend line. But as you can see, price was rejected and fell back under the upper trend line of the downtrend channel. If price closes above the trend line, then take it. This is why I stress to you all to pay attention to s&amp;r levels before you take a trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi lgtj, based on our PM, please check the attached modified colored MA. Let me know if this is what you need. The one thing i'm not sure about is the signal line rising and falling on the current MACD bar. Is that not how it is supposed to be. The original v102 version had scaled the numbering by dividing by Point, which i presume was done to be able to compare charts on a 4digit and on a 5digit version. I have removed that division. This has also allowed to see the 0 horizontal line. Fredella

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Thanks Fredella. Look at this chart and notice where I put the red lines. The signal line still falls and the top of the macd bars and signal line can't be seen. I've also attached the colored macd that I was talking about. Thanks again. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) MACD_Colored_v102(2).mq4 6 KB | 257 downloads

Not sure what the issue is, but potentially to do with rounding. I have applied a factor of 10 and it seems to be ok now although you won't get the same scale as the previous MACD indicator. Let me know. It is attached to my earlier post.

Hi, I'm struggling with one indicator, let alone 4 or 5 ! Will do my best once i've got that issue sorted though. Would i need to store the current arrow for a couple of days until the other conditions are met, is that what you think should happen? If so, how many days? Cheers

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I would just leave the arrow on, unless there is another new opportunity. So basically the arrow will be on, till the next time all indicators line up again.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Good idea lostfx, but I suggest that the arrow should be for the macd, rsi, and 2ma cross only. It also should appear for a conservative valid signal only. I would leave the slopes on the chart for visual confirmation. The arrow should also stay on the chart like the 2ma cross indicator. Also, could you create it so that each individual indicator's settings could be changed. For example, let's say I wanted to change the rsi setting from 8 to 5 or the macd setting from 12,26,9 to 5,13,1 etc. If you could create this, it would be a great tool for this method and help clean up the charts .

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi, a first stab at this is attached. I've integrated this in the current 2MACrossover indicator and added configuration for MACD, RSI, and the signal slopes at the end. The arrows are green and red and will appear slightly offset from the other arrows so that if they appear on the same day you see that. It looks as if they do appear on the same day or the next day there is a strong change there is a trend. Have a look and comment. You should just remove the current 2MACrossover indicator and add the weekly trend v1.0 indicator attached. I can't promise that in case of any modifications or enhancements needed i can do that immediately but will try and be as quick as i can. Fredella

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi, Fredela! I just see one set of arrows. Not two.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
it doesn't seem to be working on mine metatrader.... lostfx

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi, which currency pair and period are you looking at? Some will not have valid signals for a while. If you let me know i can post a screenshot of what i see for that pair.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hello Fredella. Here's a screen shot of gbpusd daily. The red lines aren't conservative valid signals. The yellow lines are where the arrows should appear. Also, it appears that the 2ma cross arrows are the only arrows on the chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi, the magenta and light blue arrows should be the original 2MA crossover arrows. Additionally you should see additional red and green arrows for the conservative entries, either on the same or on later dates. Please check if you see any errors in the Journal tab of the trade terminal. You might me missing a custom indicator. Please see my screenshot for the same period. I have also attached an update on the indicator since i found a bug. The new version is v1.1

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Your screen shot looks good, but look at my chart. The red and green arrows aren't there. What could the problem be? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #309 ---
sorry for the noob question but i have downloaded the slope indicator file and have no idea how to import it into meta trader, any suggestoins would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Great Thread, I got it to work.Try deleting 2MA cross indicator and MACD indicator.Then load new Weekly Trend indicator and new MACD Coloured indicator, should then work OK.

Hello and welcome to this thread. Close your meta trader platform, and follow these directions. 1) Left click on the start icon on your desk top. 2) Left click on computer or my computer . 3) Double left click on hard disk drive (c) . 4) Double left click program files . 5) Scroll down and find your meta trader platform and double left click on it. 6) Find the experts folder and double left click on it. 7) Find the indicators folder and double left click on it. 8) Now left click and hold your mouse on the slope indicator and slide it into the indicators window and close the window. 9) Open up your meta trader platform and go to your custom indicators icon and find the slope indicator. 10) Double left click on it and apply your settings and colors. 11) Left click ok , and you should see it on your chart. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hi, you need to have the MACD_Colored_lgtj.ex4 indicator in your custom indicator folder otherwise it won't work. I know the current one is having the issue with the signal line, but you can copy your preferred MACD indicator (like MACD2CHistg.ex4) to that indicator file and it should work. I just tried it myself. Apologies for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hello Fredella. I have the macd in my custom indicator folder, but I still can't get it to work.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Here's a screenshot with the modified macd and the weekly indicator. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #320 ---
So I want to make sure I have this right. The pink and blue arrows are higher risk than the red and green?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi could you paste a screenshot of the Journal tab in the Terminal window with the latest entries in there. I would need to compare with mine.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
What and where is the journal tab?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hi, hit Ctrl-t to get the terminal window, then go the Journal tab. Then reload the indicator and send me the latest messages that you see in there.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I hit ctrl-t, but I didn't see a journal tab.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
You need to do this with Metatrader active, i.e. it needs to be selected by the mouse. Another way is to go to the top menu, next to File you see the View dropdown menu. Go in there and select Terminal.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Fredella I don't know how to save it as a picture, but the last line reads "Custom indicator RSI GBPUSDm,Daily; loaded successfully"

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Ok, that means it is not loading "MACD_Colored_lgtj" properly. It must be a file called "MACD_Colored_lgtj.ex4" in the "yourMT4Folderexpertsindicators" folder. Is that the case? Since we're at it, i have attached the yet to be tested corrected version of it. We might as well all have a go at it at the same time.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Ok, I loaded the new colored macd and the weekly indicator, but the second set of arrows still does not appear. The journal reads, "Custom indicator MACD_Colored_lgtj(2)GBPUSDm,Daily; loaded successfully"

--- 帖子 #329 ---
hmmm ... not sure what's wrong now. Could you paste me what the Experts tab is saying in the same Terminal window? btw if you want to be able to take screenshots look for Screen Grab Pro. It allows you to grab regions of your screen anywhere you like and save them to a file.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
It reads, "Cannot open file 'C rogram FilesIBFX Trader 4indicatorsSlope Direction Line.ex4' on GBPUSDm,Daily"

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Ok, i thought you would have that as it is part of the strategy. Anyway, i have attached it here. Put it in your experts/indicators subfolder please.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Fredella, I had to leave but I'm back now. I have the slope indi's on my chart, but I still got the same message and no second set of arrows. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Ok, copy it to the other (standard) indicators directory directly underneath your MT4 platform directory and check if any better

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Fredela after I downloaded those two last indicators that you placed here, the arrows showed up. it works. Thanks, lost

--- 帖子 #335 ---
any signals recently? it looks like all pairs are in range (consolidation).

--- 帖子 #340 ---
No offense, but I don't have a secret decoder ring. OMG, what happened to your chart?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi, the attached indicator is a standalone trendindicator based on the conservative signal. It does not include the 2MACrossover arrows which you have to add manually, or go without. Alerts and emails can be configured. Fredella

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Fredella, thanks for the indicator, but I still can't get the arrows to show up. When I checked the experts tab, it read that the file could not be opened. Thanks anyway.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi, has anyone any suggestions for lgtj as I'm running out of ideas.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
as I said earlier,I couldn't get arrows too but after I downloaded your indicators from this thread they showed up.

Try downloading another demo MT4 site, i have been using Interbank FX. Works OK

For the past couple of weeks I've been doing some back and forward testing to make this method better, and I think that I've accomplished that goal. I'll post some charts and explanations shortly. The basic rules are still the same with some minor changes. Instead of using two slope indicators, I use one set at 20,3,0. Trades are taken on the daily charts. Use the weekly charts for confirmation of the trend. Valid Buy Signal: 2ma cross up arrow, 20 slope indicator is blue, rsi 8 above the 50 line, and the macd bar is above and/or touching the signal line when below the 0 line. Or the macd bar is touching or above the signal line when above the 0 line. The macd bar must be green. All of these conditions don't have to be met on the same candle. Valid Sell Signal: 2ma cross down arrow, 20 slope indicator is red, rsi 8 below the 50 line, the macd bar is below and/or touching the signal line when above the 0 line. Or the macd bar is touching or below the signal line when under the 0 line. The macd bar must be red. All of these conditions don't have to be met on the same candle. Entry: High/Low of the signal candle. As usual, watch for s&amp;r levels before taking an entry. Exit: S&amp;R level, 50sma, trend line, predetermined pip target. Your choice. Stop Loss: Above/Below nearest s&amp;r level, recent fractal high/low, etc. First example: Gbpusd daily valid sell signal. Red arrow is the target. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello! Very nice and detailed post's with lots of screen shots. Only probably I don't like about "Weekly" time frame is that trades come so infrequently that you try to continue studying in hindsight since LIVE trading signals don't keep you active. Which then you begin "adding" or "changing" your original strategy. Keep it as your first begin trading it or else you will lose where you originally started. Good luck SIR. Keep at it!

Hi Guys, Have just finished reading this thread and think I'm starting to grasp it... Would one of you mind posting what indicators you are using now so I can set them up on my charts... There are so many different ones in the indicator folder that if you don't mind listing the ones you are using now it would ensure that I get off on the right foot...By the way you don't need you to post the actual indicator just the names of the correct ones and I will get them from the folder myself... Thanks alot in advance and also thanks to lgtj for all your hard work, patience and good will towards us newbies....... Blinkers...........

I took most of these winners...amazing. It will take another week before I'll pinch myself to see if this is real. I could have done better holding for more pips instead of closing at first pivot, or other support I saw. A couple stoploss settings were bigger than my tp. I'll need to work on my risk management too...and I will now that I feel how well it works. It really works well for me so far. I like to set and forget. I like the fact that very few lines are manually drawn..just a weekly or daily trendline, or channel...no fibs are mentioned that I recall and I don't miss them since folks all draw them differently. Thanks for a wonderful gift. Steve

--- 帖子 #359 ---
You're welcome and keep on making those pips.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Was this a valid signal that went wrong? Or am I completely misunderstanding this system? After looking at your picture of usdcad why do you have a blue arrow on the 26th but my chart doesn't?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hello shortass and welcome to this thread. First, you need to check the settings of the 2ma cross indicator and make sure they match the settings on the first post. Secondly, you need to post a chart with a vertical line or an arrow on the candle that you have a question about.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I traded the EUR/JPY and got over 170 pips. So far i didn't experienced any losses with this system. I actually had 2 but it was my mistake, not the system ones. very good.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Congradulations lostfx. Which method did you use? The original method or the improved method.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
maybe you should add one more indicator for clarity

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Thanks for the quick reply. I did have success on another pair during the week and think I would have taken this trade but I saw it too late and didn't like the look of it. I checked the settings and they seem to be right. MA1=5, MA1Mode=3, PriceField1=0, MA2=8, MA2Mode=3, PriceField2=1. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #366 ---
The settings on your 2ma cross are still wrong. These are the correct settings. 1) MA1=5, MA1 Mode=1 , PriceField1= 0 2) Ma2=8, MA2 Mode=1 , PriceField2= 1 Reference the candle that you're referring to, I didn't get an arrow on that candle. When you change your settings, then your chart will look like mine.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Yep, that fixed it. Missed on the first page it was ema. Thanks

--- 帖子 #368 ---
You're welcome.

What do you mean?

Hi, lgtj. I used the new method.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thanks alot mate... Have been busy all wkend and heading abroad on business for a few days but can't wait to get stuck in to trying out this method..looks great and thanks for all the time you're putting in here to help out us beginners... Blinkers...

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hey lgtj, Seems like a good system but haven't had much luck with it. The indicators always seem to be at the end of a run when they show up then price goes the oppositeiway and I lose. Perhaps I'm using the wrong indicators. So now I'm using the new indicators that where being discussed earlier, the one with only one slope line and the 2 read or green arrow entries. Are those the ones that I should be using or the original ones, or does it matter? For example on the charts below I look at the weekly and looks like a short entry. Then look at the daily and looks like I'm to late is this correct? Or do we wait for setups that are going with the trend?

--- 帖子 #373 ---
If you've looked at the most recent charts that I've posted, you'll notice that every signal worked out perfectly. If you're losing, that means that you're not patient enough to let the trade play out and/or your stop loss is too close. Remember I stated in my first post that this is a long term trading method. Price action will not always go in your direction at first, but eventually it'll get there if you're patient enough to wait. Usually after price has made a large move in one direction, it'll retrace and try to correct itself before it starts to go in its original direction. As long as you stay with the weekly trend, you'll be ok. Reference the arrow indicators, it doesn't matter which ones you use. As long as they agree with the rsi, macd, and slope indicator.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Scratch99, On 11/20/09 I posted the above post reference Nzdusd daily. The move will always occur on the daily chart first before you see a valid signal on the weekly chart. With the improved method, you would have already been in this move. Also with the improved method, we monitor the daily charts and use the weekly charts for confirmation of the daily.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Great!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Thanks for your help. I may get it eventually, I hope.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
It's not hard at all. Re-read the improved method and study the examples that I posted, and you'll do good.

hi, I am reading your topic dear lgtj. I should say million thanks for your support and help another traders like me. I am trying too test and get better in this method. I have a doubt on a pair in this method. in this chart it seems going up on USD CHF on daily. can u please check it and send your openion ? I have not any open position that I am asking you about that. But The usd chf pair is hard pair too say any forcast too that ... because of chf. SORRY again : my internet connection have a small problem now And I couldn't upload that picture.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hello Wincent and welcome to this thread. Look at the weekly and daily charts. Usdchf is in a down trend. So we should not be looking to go long. There was a valid sell signal given on the daily chart, but price has retraced quite a bit to correct itself. Right now price is between resistance 1.0244 and support 1.0037. If you look at the daily chart, price has been consolidating between these levels for the past three weeks until it broke south. On friday, price went back up and closed between these levels again. Plus there is a lower trend line below on the daily and weekly. So I would not touch this pair right now. Remember if you're not sure about a set up, don't trade that pair and go to another pair.

What do you think of GBPUSD. I think this is an uptrend on monthly and weekly. Looks like weekly has a buy signal once we get over 1.6830. Can you have a look at this one. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Look at these charts. On the weekly chart, gbpusd is ranging. On the daily chart, price has been ranging in between resistance 1.6895 and support 1.6300(psych level) for the past 3 to 4 weeks. There is no trend right now. And price is hanging around the trend line also. Personally, I would like to see price break north or south past one of these levels, retrace, and head back in its original direction. For now I would wait to see what happens this week.

I see what your saying. Learning a lot here. So far I have found no charts that we can use.

What do you think of this on the weekly NZDUSD? A valid trade?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
It is not a valid set up because the rsi is not below the 50 line.

Hi lgtj, I've been reading up on your thread. The system seems quite promising. Looking at the USD/CHF, what do you think of a short at the close of todays candle? Thanks. pipsacker

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hello pipsacker and welcome to this thread. I don't feel to comfortable with this pair right now. There was a valid short signal given, but I still don't feel confident enough to make a trade. It might work out. I don't know.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thanks. Probably needs to head south a bit more. I'll keep an eye on this candle. That was only thing that resembled a trade that I could find. My micro does not have AUD/JPY or NZD/JPY. pipsacker

Hello lgtj, i am very intresting by your way of trading, thank you for all your job and your kindness for helping traders i have some questions.. 1) do you have to wait the close of the day (on a daily chart) if the signal is valid for taking a trade on the high/low on the candle ? 2) do you use the indicators of post 2 or do you use an updating version ? 3) Is it possible for you to post the indicator and the templates you use now.. ? thank you, it would be great Thank you for your answers PS : sorry for my bad english, i am french and also for my stupid questions..

Hello Maklla and welcome to this thread. This method also work on the smaller time frames, BUT I work full time during the day and I can't catch the big moves during the London/New York sessions. So I designed this method for the higher time frames. Nice trade though.

hello lgtj, a long for eurusd at the close of today ? i ask the question.. oops i have not see the red bar of the macd... i think now it will be not a good trade..

--- 帖子 #402 ---
According to the improved method, this is not a valid signal because the macd bar is not green. You need to delete the 30,3,0 slope indicator and change the 15,3,0 indicator to 20,3,0.

hello, my first trade with the method of lgtj.. a short with usdchf.. all signals seems to me valid ( i hope so) the vertical red candle is the candle of the signal, i take a short on the low of the candle..

Hi lgtj, My monthly pivot indicator is not working properly since the month changed. The printing and lines are all jumbled at the end. I tried refreshing it, but that does not help. Any suggestions? Thanks. pipsacker

sorry forgot to put the vertical lines

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Thanks. Do you see the difference between the original and the improved methods?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Reference the gu trade, you entered 1 candle too early. The macd green bar was still under the signal line. The green macd bar must be touching or above the signal line at the close of the candle.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
According to where you placed your vertical lines, I'm assuming that those were your valid signal candles. After looking at the charts I noticed a couple of things. Eurjpy - I would consider that a risky trade because the previous four candles did not close below that resistance level that turned into support. Eurusd - Although the trade went in your favor, you entered one candle too early because the 20 slope line was still blue at the close of that candle. I want to make sure that every trade that you take is a high probability trade. Keep posting your trades as you take them. You're helping others see the power of this system on the smaller time frame. Great work!

--- 帖子 #421 ---
thank you i appreciate your comments and will be more carefull about setups next time i take a trade, in fact i might close the ej trade since its going against me if it closes above the slope and above the second resistance. thank you regards

what do you think about gu? the indi's are all getting in line on 1h tf just 2ma crossover missing.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I would not take a trade this late. Besides, price is ranging between those resistance levels according to your chart. Can you post that pivot indicator that I see on your chart? I like it.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks for the reply about the monthly pivot, lgtj. pipsacker

--- 帖子 #425 ---
You're welcome.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
thanks for your thoughts.here is the indi

--- 帖子 #427 ---
hello lgtj, what about this trade ? short usdcad ? R1 not touching.. macd red, sloope red, rsi&lt;50..

--- 帖子 #428 ---
and this one audusd for a long .. ? perhaps the green bar macd is to far from the signal ligne..

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Draw your trend lines on the weekly chart first so that I can see where price is in relation to the trend lines. I'm still at work. I'll be leaving shortly.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
This one is not valid because the green macd bar is not touching or above the signal line.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Look at these weekly and daily charts of usdcad. On the weekly, there is a sell arrow, the 20 slope is red for now, the rsi is below the 50, but the macd is green and above the signal line which is a buy signal. This is a sign that price is ranging. On the daily, price is ranging between resistance 1.0586 and support 1.0320. Although there is a sell signal on the daily, the weekly confirms that price is ranging on the daily. Personally, I would pass on this pair for now.

Hello, a question about this trade for 04/12/2009 (long eurusd) slope is ok (green) macd is ok green, above the signal line what do you think about this trade and do you see an other pair with a valid signal (on the 12 others..) thank you..

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Although there is a valid buy signal, look at the previous candles. Price really isn't moving after that long breakout candle a few days ago. Price is ranging right now. The macd bars are about the same height and the rsi is sort of flat which is a sign of ranging. I would stay away from this pair for now.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
hello everyone here's the trade i took today on gu.i've just closed it for 89pips. i like the system more every day i trade it. thanks lgtj

--- 帖子 #436 ---
This was a perfect set up with perfect results. Great job!

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi Maklla, Nice trade! Did you compare the 1H chart to the Daily or 4H before entering? pipsacker

--- 帖子 #438 ---
hello as you see on the 1H chart there is a divergence and a trendline broken of the resistance where the signal appeared for short.and on the daily chart you can see that the 1,6660 zone was a hard resistance from june. and on the othere daily chart you can see the resistances and monthly pivot res1. this was my view.but im still in the learning process.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Good analysis!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Thanks for the explanation, Maklla. pipsacker

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Great spot on the Divergence entry with the trend line break. Nice trade!

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Really quiet thread. Is anyone still trading this system? If yes, how are the results? Thanks. pipsacker

--- 帖子 #443 ---
This thread seems to be dead. I wonder what happened? pipsacker

--- 帖子 #444 ---
dont know markets are in range, waiting for a setup tp show up

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi All, What is the session start time and end time that are used for formng the daily bars? Are you using New York session? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Well I guess I'll be the first to sound off that I'm still here!! LOL! During this time of EXTREME ranging, I have simply dropped down to the 1H - 4H combo that was talked about earlier. Going after much smaller TP's (30-60's) but still catchin' some movements! I have started opening dual lots so I have 2 TP targets, then move 2nd lot to BE when 1st is hit. Seems to be working well, but I will enjoy when we get back to some SERIOUS movement...... Haven't seen many of the usuals in here for a min., so they might just be taking it easy till after NEW YEAR? Keep @ it Pipstacker! The method is defiantly worth it!

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Thanks, Mrezoot. pipsacker

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hello yesbee1 and welcome to this thread. Whatever time your broker's new daily candle starts. My broker's new daily candle starts at 8 pm est which is the opening of the Tokyo session.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Mrezot are you using exactly the identical setup as was originally put here for weekly / daily? thanks.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I'm still around. The markets are consolidating after the recent big moves. I'm trading on the smaller time frames until price starts moving again.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Glad to hear it is still working. Thanks, lgtj. pipsacker

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi Lg, Thanks. I also would like to let you know that I am back testing this method for day trading ES futures contract (emini S&amp;P 500) (I adjusted all the parameters to about half for the smaller TFs that I use - the 3000 tick chart.). So far it seems to work great. I need to program and do some more automated back testing. But just wanted to let you know that there's broad applicability of the concept you have developed. Thanks again for sharing this wonderful method.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I am actually using the IMPROVED method now. But yes, as laid out in post #1. Instead of 4H-D-W , I'm using 1H-4H-D. Good Luck and many pips lostfx!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi Lj, Just curious. What does 20 slope indicator measure? I mean is it the rate of change of 20 ema or 20 sma? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Never mind. I found the answer it is the HMA (Hull Moving Average) to smooth out the MA and then add color based on the change from previous bar (positive v.s negative). Thanks.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi Lg, When your trading smaller time frames are you making any adjustments to the parameters? Also this may be a basic question but, do you use any indicators for generating the various support and resistance lines? ( I am new to MT4). Thank you.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
No, I don't change the parameters. I use the weekly pivot indicator (page 1 post 2) and the monthly pivot indicator (page 5 post 75) together on the smaller time frames.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi Lg, Thanks a lot for your reply. Another basic question (please bear with me :-). I am coming from futures market where I used mostly "limit orders " both for entries and exits. In Forex it seems mostly "stop market" (i.e. market price if touched) are used. Is this order type what you use for both entries and exits? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hello yesbee1. I'm not familiar with the futures market, but I place buy and sell stop orders for my entries and exits.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hello what about this short trade on eur/usd on weekly time frame ? At 1,4586..

--- 帖子 #461 ---
This is definately a short signal on the weekly chart, BUT I would not enter yet. Look at these charts. As you can see, the move already occurred last week on the daily. The yellow line is the sunday candle that just closed which caused the weekly signal to appear. I would wait for a pull back and another sell signal on the daily before I enter a trade.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
hi, one question to the just posted charts. Have you changed anything because I just se one indicator(the second is missing to compare the colours) perhaps just missed something?.... would like to here or to see some new charts and how its going what your doing and so on...also just started to trade again after "a while" and testing this method....thanks ...!

--- 帖子 #463 ---
eur/usd. trendline down is broken so may see 1.35-1.40...before retrace hm thanks lgtj your right better wait for a new signal...

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hello Pedolino and welcome to this thread. I'm using the improved method found on page 24 post 346. It's a little different from my original method.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
ok thanks for the fast reply....! just missed (forgot) it...

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi All, Which pairs are you monitoring for the hourly setups? Thanks. - Sreechand

--- 帖子 #467 ---
At the moment I have dropped down to EUR/USD EUR/JPY USD/JPY GBP/USD GBP/JPY This is down from the typical MT4 12 pairs due to lack of recent activity. When some of the volatility comes back I'll pull the rest back up. However, BEWARE OF HOLIDAY TRADING IN ANY SETUP! :nerd:

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Wonderful system. Thanks I trade daily chart with the improved system and the stochastic. Give a try. good filter

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hello Pierre and welcome to this thread. Thank you for your comments. Post a chart of your set up with the stoch so that I could see what you see. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
what do you think about eur/usd...just thinking to short weekly signal appeared(last week) hourly? I think its perfekt want to take a short trade but not sure if its (for the system) to late?or other reason... thanks for answering...pedolino what about others , took a trade- wich one..?!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Look at your 4hr chart. If you want to go short, wait for a short signal on the 4 hr. I think the 1 hr chart is too small of a time frame to enter the market for a weekly signal. Just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
yes I meant that one- daily and 4h - not the 1h thanks!

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Don't keep second guessing yourself. Just go short with proper risk/reward ratio's. The problem with waiting when you think you should go short is that when you finally enter the trade: Your going to 'wish' you entered here or waited etc.. Pull the trigger.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
My chart with stochastic I go long when the 2 lines are up and viceversa; ofcourse after all others conditions are met

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hello fxcatty. I disagree that one should just BLINDLY pull the trigger without having a good reason to enter the market. I'm a disciplined trader, and I don't just enter the market because price is going in a certain direction. Price could retrace on you at any time, take out your stop, and then proceed in the previous direction. If I miss an entry like eurusd daily, I'll just wait for a pull back before I enter. If it doesn't pull back, oh well. I'll just trade another pair. Discipline and patience is the key to this method. Just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Nice! I see what you're talking about. I like to use 14,3,3 for my stoch settings , but I'll have a look. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi Lg, I did a visual scan on 13 pairs (except GBP/AUD, my chart does not have it). The USD/CAD and USD/JPY have potential setups (also NZD/USD and GBP/NZD are getting ready).

Alos the USD/CAD seems to be heading to MR1 but if the candle closes above that resistance it seems to be a good buy. What do you think? Is too late to get in? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hello yesbee. I watching these pairs too (uadcad, usdjpy), but I am not convinced that these pairs are ready yet. Nzdusd is the only pair that I like right now.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
You already missed the entry on this pair, but I would be careful because the rsi is below the 50 line on the weekly chart. I don't have this pair on my platform. So I can't see analyze it on my computer. P.S. I just noticed that you have rsi 14 on this pair instead of rsi 8. Why?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hi Lg, The RSI 14 was a mistake. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hi Lg, I have another question. Does all the indicators have to be in place on weekly also for confirmation? In other words what do you look in weekly chart for confirming the daily signal? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #484 ---

No, all the indicators don't have to be in place on the weekly for confirm the daily signals. Look at these audusd weekly and daily charts. On the daily, a valid short signal was given on 12/15/09. Although there is not a valid signal on the weekly chart yet, notice the bearish candle, the slope line is red, the macd bars are red and under the signal line, and the rsi is falling. This is further confirmation that the daily chart's short signal is good. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #486 ---
The initial entry for audusd has already passed, but price is in retracement at the moment. When a valid short signal is given on the 4hr, it should be ok to enter a short order. Look at these charts of audjpy. There is a valid signal on the daily, but look at how small the macd bars are. On the weekly chart, price is ranging. I would be careful with this pair. I don't feel confident enough to enter a trade with this pair yet. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I agree with the being carefull with the AUDJPY , Those MACD bars are not showing any direction at all.

Thread has been pretty quiet for a few weeks...as even the lower TF methods are a little scary with lack of trending. "End of Year" is the time for FOREX vacation and its almost over! Come NEW YEAR I look forward to knocking down some more pips with ya'll! HAPPY NEW YEAR LGTJ AND ALL FOLLOWERS!

--- 帖子 #491 ---
So who's still using this method and having success? I realised it works fairly well on weekly, daily and 4 hour but lower time frames don't work very well.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Does this method include weekly open crossovers?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Im am still currently using this method on one of my IBFX accounts. I still only use the 4H, D, W, TF's since it is bigger movements, with less screen time. During the Holidays I dropped down to the 30m, H1 ,H4 using 30 for entries. I am now back to the full TF. When I get back to the terminal I can load some screens of current set-ups. Assure you... This method is still VERY valid. ..........Even if the OP is M.I.A.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hello Mrezoot. I'm still around. Happy new year. Glad to hear that this method is still working for you.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
I will agree that it is MUCH more choppy and there are false signals... therefor you will need to be VERY patient. In the last few days i've had more screen time than usual so I put in a few lower TF's. M5-M15 so as promised...some screens. GBPJPY 30 TP = 30 pips USDJPY 30 TP = 30 pips USDCAD 10 TS = 12 pips I believe the most important aspect of the lower TF's in this system is realizing your "Likely" obtainable TP. Not just a hard 10-15-20 pips. If i think I can only get 7 out of it...I do If i think I can get 30 out of it. ..... I do As I said before, I have gone back to the higher TF's now that some market movement is finally back! (+100 pips) But as Lg can vouch... I was like you... still like to keep an eye on some scalping if I have the time to wait.... This thread was my way of weaning off of the M5-15 crackpipe. Scalping is no different that anything else.... You will not really quit until YOU are ready... Hello to you as well Lg! Hope the New Year is treating you well in Family and FX! Hoping that we can continue the thread and continue to enlighten those on the beauty of "minimal" screen time! I know its opened my eyes!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
If you're scalping with this method on the 5min chart, follow the 1Hr trend. Keep up the good work, and I'll be glad to continue this thread.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
YES YES YES!! This is VERY IMPORTANT!! Don't know how I forgot to mention that! If you recieve a signal that confilicts w/ the H1 trend, NO GO !! Not to condone in lower TF's but that was the intention of the thread. (Expose the Trend) So remember thats why your here..... To Trade the Trend.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Here is the last one for the week. Cut @ 18 pips since I try to not carry over w.e. on small TF trades. EURJPY M15 w/ confirmation in M30 and H1 of trend. See ya'll next week...

--- 帖子 #499 ---
In the nature of all things, one can never leave "good enough" alone. I have been using this system since the birth of this thread, which has not been THAT long (round 3 1/2 months) and all the while, making consistent profits even when my other systems were falling a little more "miss" than "hit". I stuck in here and started to realize a common trait amongst "Pro" traders. THEY DON'T SPEND EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY IN FRONT OF A SCREEN! The BIG money is in the BIG movements... which are on BIG TF's! * I will here acknowledge that w/ proper MM, scalping and low TF trading is possible and can be VERY profitable, but requires MUCH more emotion and thought PER TRADE, IMHO, than a system like this one. All that said, I continued to study the higher TF's and their patterns and tendencies. The basis that Lgtj had laid out was @ the right place @ the right time for me. Keeping his template in place on one broker, I began to work on my own twist on what had been provided. Indi by indi they came and went (like many/all traders do) and I have now been using this set-up for about 2 months (ish) w/ great results. Still using acknowledgement of S/R, Pivots, Big #'s (.X000) This is nothing different than the original set-up, just slightly cleaner n clearer IMHO - The RSI 8 line has been replaced w/ a 2- t o n e signal filter. (This helped me see whether the RSI was over 0.0 with my bad eyes n' all! lol) - I decided to go with a different signal indi than the 2ma. (This filtered out some of the "whipsaws" that resulted in a rouge non-valid arrow) That's all that has been changed other that colors n such. If anyone would be interested I can load the templates w/ prefered TF's. As I said before, I believe that this is ALL that you need to be VERY profitable whether you have all day in front of a screen or not!! I cannot thank you enough Lg for what you have given back... to me @ least! Speaking for myself..... Priceless! Enjoy the pips all and take advantage!

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Sorry I meant to post this in the other pics, but here is an A-B. Like I said... same stuff. Just a little cleaner.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hello Mrezoot I certainly agree with you regarding the higher time frames and less screen time. I have been trying to get up to speed on this thread....I think I have the hang of it ....so to speak. Can you please post the indi you use that is "different signal indi than the 2ma" (is it the indi that creates the red and green dot on your screen?) Has the two tone filter you speak of been posted? I like to keep things as indicator free as possible.....but I would like to play with the two indicators I am asking about Many thanks for your posts and obviously to to the fellow who created this thread best wishes PGPB

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Thank you for your comments and your contributions to this thread. I like your new set up also. I'll pop in from time to time and post possible set ups. I'm currently forward testing another system that I'm working on that is more profitable than this one. But the concept is still the same. I made +500 pips this week alone with my new system. The amazing part is that this is the first week that I've tested my new system. Continue to post your charts and keep this thread alive because you understand how to trade this system. Thanks. lgtj

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hello pgpb and welcome to this thread. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to post. We'll be happy to help you get up to speed.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Thank you and welcome to the thread Pgpb! I really appreciate your interest in my improvements! I believe that people learn better using their own deductive reasoning, as opposed to blindly following a set of rules put forth. This is simply because they do not yet know WHY that is a rule! So in that nature I will post the indis and temp's. With this system (Lgtj) I noticed that some of the pairs gave more/less signals that others. I began to attribute this to each pairs different tendencies and having its own "personality". If you have spent ANY amount of time watching the screens, this is common sense to you now. Noticing this lead me to create a template for EACH pair and its optimized TF, IMHO . (I only will post 6 now with more to come) I will AGAIN reiterate the fact the I have not CHANGED this sytem! These are modifications and TF's that I use to make more clear, sound calls. The pack will be zipped with the O.P. screen name as the P.W. (All CAPS) This is a very small step that I think may prevent many lazy non-readers from swipping. (Swipper NO Swipping!) Moving on.... The RSI filter @ the bottom of the screen has been set to 8. This was the original setting as Lgtj. This simply tells you when the signal is over the 50 w/ Green or Red. The "dot" signal indi is a trending indi that is easily found with a little work. This indi is where the MAIN difference in the templates and TF's are shown. As long as you have a "loose" grasp on the original set-up, this one will be much easier to read I believe. Just take the templates, the rules, and plug them in as best you can to backtest! The beauty of the P-Monthly is that the previous months levels remain so your backtesting w/ respect to pivots and S/R. I am glad to see that you are trying to grasp this concept Pgpb! Stick w/ it... Lg once told me that the patience would eventually pay off.... He was right........ Lg has stated that he is testing a new method @ the time.... as am I One with direct methods implemented in this thread. As progress continues I will keep all posted, i'm sure Lg will as well. If you still have ANY questions, please, post them and take the time to learn! Remember.... we all started @ the same place.... somebody telling us about FX... Now lets learn to get there together!

First, let me know when you get it Keith (PW), so I know who's up to speed! Look forward to hearing from you and your experiences w/ this. I hope that the required reading has provided you with a little more knowledge than you had before in the workings of this system. I will say once again.... If you are NEW to the thread, First off...... WELCOME! Now, I recommend beginning with the original template and set-ups. (As per post #1) Listen and follow Lgtj's rules and learn from the examples that have been laid before you in this thread. There are a few things to learn here about S/R and Pivot respect. (This is the only "discretionary" aspect of the system, in my mind) If you are comfortable using and interpreting S/R and Pivots, this will be nothing new to you. Just acknowledge them as you have and your off to the races! If this IS new stuff to you, (S/R, Pivot's), DON'T FORCE IT! Keep the P-Monthly indi on your charts and just take notice of the ways that it interacts w/ the different S/R levels. * One of my biggest beginner mistakes was putting too much trust in S/R and Pivots that had been posted and plotted on other "Signal" sites. Yes EURUSD is @ a S2 level, but NO , that does NOT mean that the price is REQUIRED to turn around because its at a known support! Not that simple I'm afraid! That is what cost me sooo much in the beginning! So......... I decided I needed to learn how to plot and use my own damn S/R lines and levels! IMHO you cannot just "up-n-learn".... S/R, Pivots, Fibo, Gann...any of these. These are things that must work their way into your trading subliminally. I believe, that when you are READY to study, learn, and implement these forms of analysis, YOU will know! And you will more than likely already be doing it, in some manner..... You will begin to draw an "imaginary" middle line that price closes above and below...(Your Pivot) Then one day you notice "Hey, It didn't go any higher than 1.3700 last month...Looks like a time to sell!" (Your S/R) All of these things in hind sight seem like common sense. That's O.K....It hit me that hard too! All I can advise is to not FORCE or RUSH ANY part of this thread! When you are comfortable w/ the original set-up, give my spin on the set-up a shot! I just ask to please UNDERSTAND the original set-ups and rules before even trying the new Zooted version! You might not know what your looking for yet! I will not answer questions that have already been answered by the original systems rules! (i.e. THIS THREAD!!!) The system was originally designed to look @ (place trades) once a day! SO SLOW DOWN AND TAKE YOUR TIME! The Market will still be here AFTER you learn this system! I promise! I really look forward to seeing some of the new traders progress and their twists on it.... as it is the nature of things...... adapt! Sry for this very long blerb, I'm just trying to lay down a few pointers so any NEW followers will be up to speed and can participate in some of the new testings and help share results! I would bet money, being this late, that I have left somethin g out of this (way too) long post that SHOULD have been here.... we will leave that for tomorrow! Always here for questions!

Hi mr and all the new members to the thread. Happy new year to you all. Thank you for your continued input mr, I will look at the new improvements you have made, I have been using the second version of the setup since it came out where we went from 2 trend slope indicators to 1. I've been trading this system mechanically since its release using a fixed 1:1 r/r and taking every signal that triggered according to the rules and its been a solid winner on GBP/USD and EUR/YEN (im sure all the other pairs work i just haven't had time to backtest the other 11 pairs yet). What kind of style do you employ mr. ? Just taking signals that are valid but have enough space to run to the pivots / ma's ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Heyday! Is there anything to correct? Thanks a ton for your feedbacks. Kindest regards

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I believe that this might just sum it up. In order to find my projected TP and SL I use the Fibo tool as laid out by Lg in post #20. Which works out to be 1:1 R/R If I have plenty of headroom before encountering a pivot or S/R I will take that valid signal. Along with the other recent improvements, I stared to place x2 positions on open, so that one can be cut for banked profit @ the 50% TP line. Good to see you here again kaaea! Glad to see your still participating! Any other questions please feel free to ask!

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hello Forexcube and welcome! My only recommendation w/ your set-up is to use the P-Monthly indi when using the daily charts. Your chosen indi, weekly, was mis-posted by Lg in #2. The correct monthly version is in post #75. This will give you a more accurate reading of the S/R and pivots for your TF. As far as I can tell otherwise, you have the original set-up perfect! :nerd: With a little bit of testing (Back/Forward), you will begin to recognize the set-ups of a valid signal. Good luck and please feel free to ask ANY questions you may have! And again...welcome aboard!

Thank you so much for your support DuggieFX! I too feel very privileged to exchange ideas w/ such a friendly and helping group of traders! I have been seeing quite a few NEW members here recently, this is a good sign to me that the system is somewhat easy to grasp. Even for those that are fairly new to FX. I look forward to helping all of the new followers learn the ropes of the original setup. As each prove to understand the basis of that system, we can move on to look @ some of my chosen improvements to the original. We are in NO hurry. And I WILL NOT rush. I encourage others to post some of their screens this week. This might also help some of the new followers, to see some other colored screens and templates. Were here to learn..... So don't be afraid to ask ANYTHING! Always glad to see a new follower!

Well this week did not open with much of anything worth talking about... Most of the pairs I laid out in "Zooted-Lgtj" are still hovering around S/R or a Pivot and not showing much certainty of a direction. I am still, personally, a little unsure of how to take the EURs and GBPs @ this moment with all of the recent "out-of-norm" events. So I am patiently on the sidelines w/ them until I feel a lil' more comfortable w/ their action and direction. BUT THATS OK! We don't have to FORCE trades here... They come to us! I do want to point out tonight the USDCAD H4 template I provided. We are still as of now, about 30 pips above the pivot. The last (3) H4 bars have shown downward movement. As well, 2 of our MACD bars are now showning RED . Things are starting to go our way on the H4. While the Daily chart shows our "Slope" about to cross UP over the 50 SMA, price is seeming to have respected the downward resistance line and looks to be turning around. If the downward force can push it through the pivot, I believe we could easily see 1.04000 on this move. The weekly chart also shows the overpowering downward trend. This trade IS NOT valid yet. I am just bringing to attention how the pieces fall into place. At this rate, in the next 8-16 hrs it may break the pivot and be on its way south again. Since there is a factor of uncertainty where the price will go.... (Especially when we leave our terminal...LMAO!) We will be relying on Buy/Sell stops for our orders. This keeps us from getting into positions before the trend is fully developed and moving. In the case of the USDCAD I might be looking to place my Sell Stop @ around 50 pips below the pivot (Some might feel comfortable w/ it even closer) . Using the Fibo tools for TP and SL. Hope this helps some folks, a recent example of a forming signal. This week should still have PLENTY of interesting signals... so lets go through this together! Lets have a productive week!

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Here is a prime example of why we place Buy/Sell orders.. Price floated about 7-10 pips over the pivot, and was then rejected. Your Sell Stop 30-50 pips below pivot would have never been opened. This is why we ACKNOWLEDGE these levels! Things MIGHT happen in our favor in these levels. It was a potential set-up that fell through. This will happen often. Just remember that patience thing Lg and I spoke of!

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Mrezoot looking at the USDCAD 4 hour chart with the older RSI (rather than your version) it looks rather overbought, it has been over the 70 level since Wednesday. Of course this does not mean that it can not break to the upside.....but from looking at charts it seems that often a currency will need to come down a bit before it breaks up I am new to this thread so obviously take my comments with a "grain of salt" so to speak. I am studying all this trying to figure out about re-entering a trade. (I don't have any clear ideas yet)

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Good observation on the RSI Pgpb. While the price did shoot back up over the downward resistance line, it did not remain over it for long. I would for sure keep an eye on this chart! Peeking @ the H1 it seems to be losing its steam in the 1.058-1.060 range. Last nights little bump up could very well be the common attempt at correction you speak of Pgpb! We will see how this set-up unfolds today! Thank you for your participation Pgbp, your inquires will only help others!

--- 帖子 #524 ---
This is for those of you who have been running my "Zooted-Lgtj" templates. I unfortunately did not catch this signal, was working in the studio. GBP/JPY H1 "Zooted" chart. Price came back up to S1 , pump faked about 30-40 pips (Pgbp), then continued on up. If the signal WAS taken you would be lookin @ about 35-50 pips bagged as of now, depending on your choice of entry. With an active pair like GBP/JPY, this is about where I would be looking to cut for a profit. On my GBP/JPY H1 I like to keep my TP's set around 50-60 pips. This amount is easily obtainable w/ the usual P.A. of this pair, but BEWARE , this pair is called "The BEAST" for a reason! NEVER GET GREEDY W/ GBPJPY! As fast as it gave you 60, it will take 120. This IMHO is the most risky pair I watch. Which is why I went w/ only H1 TF. To keep my TP/SL's smaller. (Risk) Just goes to show that sometimes even w/ a system that seems slow @ times... one can still slip by ya! So did anybody else notice/catch this.......if so.... brag!

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Lets keep an eye on this one! We should follow the same rules as last night and wait to see reaction to pivot and upper resistance. All we can do is wait....

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Just an update on the signal I missed earlier this afternoon. If you would have been present @ signal, I would have recommended to place a Buy Stop about 15-25 pips above the " Dot " signal bars HIGH. With this method, you would have already hit your 50% TP and come only about 5 pips short of your TP1 @ 100pips. You might have chosen to cut it being THAT close, (90ish pips) and with the tendencies of this pair! IF I HAD caught this signal, I would have cut half (1/2) of my lot(s) size @ the 50% TP. ( BANKED ) When 50% TP is reached, I then move the remaining half (1/2) lot(s) SL to breakeven. If / When price is approaching the TP1 level (around 15-25 pips away), I will then move the remaining lot(s) SL to the 50% TP level. ( BANKED ) This secures @ least my 50% TP level for BOTH halves of my chosen lot size. This little technique has proved to be VERY helpful to me in securing profits, and not letting the market take them back! I hope that the pic will help answer some questions about placing your TP/SL levels. Again, I only use the Fibo tool set-up as provided by Lgtj in post #20 Taking this signal would have been a pretty nice pop.... hope somebody got it....

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Not seeing much of any changes since the H4 screen before.... Not quite the case on the H1 if you drop down. On this TF you can see that price is having a little bickering match between the Pivot, downward-trendline, and 50 SMA. Which will win? We do however on the H1 have 3 of 4 indi's confirming a SHORT call. (In our favor) Since this pair has had so much trouble with this area, we must not jump the gun w/ only 3 of 4 indis confirming. We will have to wait until we have a clear reaction of price to the Pivot and 50 SMA. Still keep an eye out.... :nerd: for a BREAK OUT!

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Well before I closed the station tonite, did one last check on USDCAD.... Looks like for the moment, Pivot and SMA whooped up on that poor trend line. This pushed the price up over 1.06160 (A 30 day high). A strong BULL rally seems to be over due for the USDCAD, however, we still have what seems like fairly strong downward momentum on the Daily and Weekly charts. :nerd: Now a little feedback if you do not mind....... What is YOUR opinion of this pair, as of now? Could you also please validate your opinions w/ a chart or at least a quick summary of the analysis (Fundamental / Technical) you used to draw this conclusion? Look forward to hearing logic for BOTH sides of this trade! (Buy/Sell) Have a Good Night Guys!

--- 帖子 #529 ---
i claim to b no charting wiz:nerd: but i still have 830 mins in my day before i can tell you forsure if this is going to be a bull rally!!...there is a strong resistance line that PA has been obeying for 10 weeks... gonna b hard to break, but if it does u can bet il have a buystop inline...

--- 帖子 #530 ---
I encourage others to post some of their screens this week. This might also help some of the new followers, to see some other colored screens and templates. Were here to learn..... So don't be afraid to ask ANYTHING! well zoot here ya go... i woulda posted some screens earlier but i had a headache that kept me away from my screen... sorry for the delay. but anyways i have been using the sonic system as i have told you previously, and here i have added a lil of my sys. w a lil of your sys.... i hope adding this doesnt anger the tread of its direction... i woke up kinda late for this trade but was able to pick up on retrace...

--- 帖子 #531 ---
New to the thread, at least new to posting, but have been following for a little while since I stumbled on this and so far I am impressed and excited about the potential. Thanks to LGTJ for starting and sharing and also MREZoot for building and continuing and looking forward to contributing and learning! I am placing demo trades and mostly up...a few challenges with s&amp;R lines but that will come with practice. One (simple) question I had was when you placing the daily trade, you need to check the the trend of the weekly trend, right? If correct, what doyou take into consideration to confirm the weekly trend - is it the slope, or trend lines? Thanks Magou

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hello magou and welcome to this thread. The trend line on the weekly chart confirms the trend. If you have any more questions, feel free to post them.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
good morning... decided to go back to the old mac d and try it, but noticing it likes to mach the alter trend signal or vise versa depending on how you wanna look at it. personally i am looking for less indicators and IMHO that alter trend looks so MUCH cleaner, just wondering was there any reason to still keep mac d? duglas

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I like to use the macd because it shows you when price breaks resistance and support whenever the macd bars go above and below the signal line. It's a wonderful tool if you know how to use it.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I think that everyone here is open-minded enough to view and compare screens and set-ups... You never know what you might end up liking? A little bit of color never hurt anybody! LOL! This is quite an interesting layout I must say! I have not had time to view very much of Sonic's "R" thread, but I recognize it as one of the more trusted and followed lower TF scalping systems! (To boot, Sonic carries himself like a true gentleman and does a stand up job keeping his thread on track!) Quick question DuggieFX? What Pair and TF was this screen shot of? (Think OHLC's off?) This way myself and others can compare your view, with whats going on in thier charts. A little A-B comparing. I believe this is how people find what they truly like... experimentation. A nice chart non-the-less DuggieFX thank you again for your participation!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Quick question DuggieFX? What Pair and TF was this screen shot of? (Think OHLC's off?) zoot, i believe the screen you were referring to was the AUDUSD 1H chart.... duggie

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Don't think that were speaking of the same chart DuggieFX? USDCAD is @ 1.06088 You screen shows a price of 1.40948 Just curious?

--- 帖子 #538 ---
So you have now told me the TF and Pair for every chart of yours, EXCEPT the one I was originally inquiring for... I now have post #529 and #533 .... how about #530 in a chipper mood today and just givin ya a hard time! THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME DuGGieFX!

--- 帖子 #539 ---
omg lmao its been a long night duglas!! sorry bub, that is the eurusd on 1h final answer.lmao dugg

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Now I can really start looking @ what it is that you've shown! Thank you for your time and input DuGGie! Now it sounds like you need to go get some sleep before lookin @ anymore charts!

--- 帖子 #541 ---
well Mr E. your usdcad bull projection looks like a winner, jumed on that as day kicked over. I was a iffy on that one!. That was a very stronnng trend it broke! sure looks like a bull rally ahead.! DUGLAS

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Thanks DuGGie! Yep, seems as soon as I left the terminal last night, USDCAD finally decided to decide a direction! It jumped the trendline and didn't stop till it hit R1 , then dropped right back down to the trendline. It has now been slowly rising the past +10 Hrs. I expect to see it "tag" the R1 again tonight... Let's see.... :nerd: If I'm judging your entry right DuGGieFX, on your (post #541) chart, you're still holding on to that long for about +10 pips right now? Hope this one holds up for you over night, if you ARE still holding.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Here is a Daily USDJPY signal that I was able to pick up today.... (2x)Sell Stops placed @ the LOW of the previous day. (89.330) Used the Lg-Fibo, placed TP's @ 40 and 80 pips, SL's place @ 80 pips. As I mentioned before, I have my "80pip-target" lot on a 40pip TS. This acts as an automatic breakeven move when your 50% TP is hit @ 40 pips. Did anybody else happen to catch this one.... It was on DAILY so someone should have!! Lets see it!

--- 帖子 #544 ---
10.6 but whos countin! very nice observation. thats kinda what im seeing there as well R1 level ...definetly in a canadian lull for the night..kept my tp on r1. gonna b working allday tomarrow so if it dont hit it tonite il c profit while at the old ,,Just Over Broke...lol duggie

--- 帖子 #545 ---
really wish i woulda had something setup on that ...zoot if anyone found i figured it would b you lol.... i was able to catch it on retrace, milked 45 PIPS on 4h chart.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I noticed the potential set-up while on my lunch-break from the studio. Was about the highlight of my day to be honest w/ you.... I can not say enough about how easy this system really is when you have gained an understanding of the rules and entries! I saw the signal forming, waited til daily candle closed (5 P.M. my time), placed the Stop Order @ previous days LOW, went back to mixing. Noticed that it had been filled a few hours later! Now all there is to do............. wait for the TP! And B.T.W. - @ this rate, looks like that USDCAD of yours will hit before you log-out.....Nice work! I don't really see anything tonight that looks worth my while. The D1 EURJPY just tapped the S2 so you might see it try to make up a little lost ground tonight. However, with its Weekly chart looking like it does, any longs are a little "Iffy" ( IMHO ) til we know if it has the 124.xxx or lower zone in its targets. Just an observation..... I'm off to bed now Have a Good Night/Morning Guys!

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Hi All, just try to wish all of the guru's that creating this lovely system. Now, just trying to understand the system on Daily basis.Perhaps, any of my mistaken can be corrected and show the way to the right direction.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hello yust and welcome to this thread. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
I never got a signal on the Daily, did get one on the weekly which I took and so far 45 pips positive. I cross-checked the zoot settings and don't see a signal their either. Any ideas why some got a signal and others not..is there something to check? Thanks M

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hello and welcome magou! Glad to see that your working on figuring out the system! Questions are GREAT in my mind.... means your actually TRYING! I honestly do not know why you would have received a weekly signal and not the daily one as well? Care to post a chart and we can work through it.... :nerd: My daily candle rolls over @ 5p.m. here. Since I had M.A.C.D. in my favor as well as the RSI, AND got my sell " Dot " few bars back), I placed my Sell Stop @ previous days LOW which was about 27 pips below the tested S1 I am very curious to see what kind of signal you DID get so I hope you have the time to post a chart or two so we can get ya straitn'd out! Welcome aboard again and if you have anymore questions... Shoot!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Good to see ya here Indrek! The settings and TF's that I have chosen for the "Zooted" templates was simply a result of about 2 weeks no sleep! LMAO! Just a trial and error of settings honestly. I decided to do different TF's since some of the pairs would move More/Less then others and I wanted to even them out a little. I will tell you though, that is VERY close to one of my original settings I was testing! Seems to be better for the higher TF's w/ those settings. Glad to see your interested in the System/Indis! Hope to see you around more often!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hi Zoot - I have attached my chart ( I hope!). The only daily signal I had was 12 bars (days) back. Is this what perhaps you were referring to? This brings up another question - how long after a signal would you still consider entering a trade, say if you missed a signal day (or for that matter a weekly signal) Thanks for the help Magou

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thanks for the chart Magou! And yes, that would have been the START of the signal I took. After a little review of your chart to mine I have found a VERY BIG difference between our P-Monthly Indi's outputs. This is something that MUST be figured out! In this system, we rely heavily on knowing these levels, way too much for an indi to be producing different results! I will be looking into this and testing to see what the problem is, or if it's one of us in particular..... I'll post mine for you to compare as well Magou. Moving on..... A VERY good question.... How long is a signal still valid? Personally, I have differing opinions depending on the chosen TF, Pair, and amount of movement (pippage) that I missed. More often than not though, if I miss it....I missed it and its off to the next... I would definitely not be hoppin' into a daily signal if I didn't at least catch it the day after it went valid...and still.... this might be too late, so consider the pippage already missed as the profit you SHOULD have had, if the signal was caught on time. I believe that people will have different opinions and ideas about the late-entry and the re-entry. This is another discretionary aspect that can only come with placing some trades and seeing what kind of trends, and movement, you catch regularly. This way, you have a better idea of what to expect out of each trade. In turn, you can then better tell how much movement you have MISSED on this trade. Hope this helps Magoe. I know its not an "In stone answer", but not too many elements of Forex are written in stone... Talk to you soon, and thank you again for your continued participation!

--- 帖子 #554 ---
After a little closer comparison Magoe, :nerd: it looks like your P-Monthly did not update to the Jan levels...... Why or how this happened I do not know? Let me know if you get this straitn' out......

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hello magou. Look at this daily chart of usdjpy. The valid signal was given on 1/12/10(red line). The horizontal line is where you would've placed your sell stop order (90.71). You would keep your order in place as long as the rsi, macd, and price action are still in agreement. According to this chart, the order would have been filled 3 days later on 1/15/10 (yellow line). In this example there was plenty of time to place your order. Your target would have been at the next support level 89.56. This would have been a successful 115 pip profitable trade. If you miss an entry, then let it go. Never chase the market because it will come back and bite you. I have been working on a re-entry method for this system that I plan to introduce soon. I'm still testing it, but so far the results are pretty good. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Swingin in with a spot-on example for ya Magoe! Just so ya know Magoe... Lgtj makes PERFECT entries in this system look easy! Take note though of how easy it CAN BE ! Hope all is going well Lg, look forward to comparing some of our NEW ideas! Make sure you have your PM enabled...

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Things are going ok so far. I've made +400 pips so far this week with my new system, but I gave some back. Still in test mode though.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
welll i woke up feelin a lil wild and messed w the gbp/jpy. very glad i did.... was able to bank 140 pip on her, anybody else catch that?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Unfortunately I was away for that one! Looks like you got enough pips off it for both of us though! LOL! Very nice DuGGie, now w/ a banked trade like that, I would just close the GBPJPY chart for the day!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Very nice Duggie. What time frame was it on? Your chart doesn't show the time frame and pair.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
As i woke up earlier this morning, i saw H1 GC pair giving me clear shot on entry.I entry a bit earlier (as THV signal) and still holding as all signal clear... MaCD, Fib's,TL and RSi. Let see it play out untill daily tf today. I think if Daily TF signal today valid, try to hold the post and re-entry another post base on Dailly TF. Refer Below :

--- 帖子 #562 ---
You seem to be gettin the hang of seeing the valid signals.... I also have my eye on this one on the H4/Daily TF in another system... I still have another 3.5 hrs before candle close so we just have to wait....

Hi, the arrows not appears in my charts, regards, fds

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hello Felipeds and welcome to the thread! To my knowledge most of the other members were having trouble getting the arrows to show w/ that indi. To the best of my knowledge, it has not continued to be used, as I have heard nothing of it in quite some time now...

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Thanks for the heads up Zoot...not sure how to sort the p-levels. Will reattach the indicator and chuck in a reboot to boot and hope for the best. LG - thanks for the run through...can I check my understanding regarding the signal by explaining it back.. 1) Arrow gave initial signal but rsi not below 50, so following day (red line) it is which makes the signal valid, entry level is at low of trigger bar but only gets taken out on yellow line? If I have that right, my only question then is about the macd level - in both cases the red line is fair distance away from the signal line - I thought it have to be close or touching..what am I missing? Many thanks both Magou

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I do not know if there is a specific amount that it must be with-in, but I do know that it must NOT be touching the signal line...this would not be a vaild signal yet. A little space there is desired.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
The red macd bars must be under the signal. The farther away, the stronger the trend. The macd bars must be close to or touching the signal line when price direction is about to change.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
ok Mrezoot, thanks.. ;fds.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Thanks for the macd lessons, much appreciated! My pivot levels are still misbehaving, anyone have any ideas on how to jumpstart them so they read/calculate the accurate levels?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
What broker are you using? I use ibfx.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I am using alpari uk...it is a demo account, not sure if that makes a difference.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
The data feeds could be different. Try an ibfx demo account and compare the two.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
There is something wrong with the P-Monthly indicator. Try this one. It has proved itself in my trading as well as different threads. In the settings, disable other pivots besides monthly and set Sunday data to "false". Although, I would suggest to have also Weekly pivots on the charts. They deserve respect at least if trading H4 TF.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Here is a good sample how PA plays with both weekly and monthly pivots.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Good lookin' out on the Pivot indi. The ###Autopivot2 was posted in this thread as well, by myself back in Oct. :nerd: This is the indi I used before the P-Monthly. The only reason I switched to the P-Monthly is that it keeps the historical levels for the past months. Looks like for now, some will need to use this till we get the P-Monthly situation straitnd' out. Thank you again for your help Inderk!

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I don't know about yours Magoe.... But the problem w/ the P-Monthly is only occurring in pairs containing the GBP on my set-ups. (IBFX, Alpari, and ODL now) So its not the brokers feed. Wondering if this is the same for anybody else? Below is my GBPUSD, GBPJPY, and GBPCHF

--- 帖子 #578 ---
I use the ###autopivot2 in my other workings as well. I tried to stay w/ P-Monthly for conformity reasons of the thread...but as you stated..... Its been more than a little inaccurate lately! Hope your systems improvements are coming along well..... I might have a few things that could help... I rummage around my stuff!

--- 帖子 #579 ---
I will continue to monitor this thread as I use some of the tools that are used here. Still, my general opinion is that this system is initially too overloaded with indicators. MACD itself is based on MAs, so adding more MAs means nothing but duplicating the signals (= cheating oneself). If a confirming tool is needed then I would use Stoch that comes from a different family. MACD + Stoch + pivots is a very good combination And, of course, AltrTrend Signal can be used additionally for visual help.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Ok..thanks Indrek..will play with the new one seeing it appears its not a feed issue.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Any body see this pair on daily basis ?? ..Hopefully tomorrow we can see the confirmation.Now just need to wait....Let's see it's play.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
GBPCHF and GBPCAD ..Just hopefully it can ride nicely.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I do not fully understand this system but according to my knowledge GBPCAD is more promising. I would not be very sure about short GBPCHF. GBPCHF made a nice move between the pivots today

--- 帖子 #584 ---
System is same as lgtj and others friends in this forum.Only i add some additional indi for confirmation and my understanding.We need to wait daily cs eventho h4 already shown the entry at the earlier stage.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Usdjpy daily just gave a valid long signal. I took the monthly pivot indicator off for now because the s/r levels are still adjusting for this month. My target will be the weekly trend line. Let's see what happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I like this trading strategy. Is the EurChf setting up for a long trade on the daily chart? It has bounced upward off the weekly pivot and the rsi is about to cross upward through the 50 level. If price continues upward, is this heading for a valid setup?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
This looks to me like it might possibly be setting up a long. :nerd: It's playing with the (H4) 50SMA right now, let's see what it does w/ that.... We still have quite a while before a daily close, but I would definitely keep a watch! Nice eye rnfuller.... oh, and welcome to the thread!

EURCHF may be ready for a long trade by the end of the day but it is a very painful pair... Daily range sth like 50 pips... After breaking monthly pivot there is some resistance around 1.476 that is Weekly R1.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Hello rnfuller and welcome to this thread. Personally, I would stay away from eurchf because it is a very choppy pair. Pull up a naked weekly chart, scroll back, and look at the price action. You will get whipped to death. Just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Thank you, Mrezoot, Indrek, and lgtj. I am aware of the cautions regarding EurChf. In many months long past I have traded it successfully, but, of course, not lately due to that very choppiness you mention. I was more concerned that I might be seeing a proper setup according to the parameters of this strategy. Its late here in the far northern mountains of California - time to sign off. Raymond

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi Indrek, is there any information anywhere that tell us the daily range of each pair? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I am not a fan and even not a user of RSI but as it is a part of this system, I would like to present a nice indicator. I personally hate any lines on my chart and always try to use bars or blocks. Maybe someone thinks the same way

--- 帖子 #593 ---
You can use the ATR indicator that is default in MT4. Or choose from these two.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Thank you Indrek.

ATR bands plotted from the open at 75%, 100%, 150% and 200% of the ATR show where the market is most likely to retrace. http://i46.tinypic.com/2jexpfs.gif

Hi I have recently found this forum and have worked my way through it. I have also loaded the indicators and played with the system (both versions). It tried it on the 1 hour time frame initially and I found myselg getting stopped out alot and lots of false entries. This is probably more to do with me than the system. I am have (today) just started testing it on the 4 hour and will use the recent fractal points as stop losses to test it out. Are the larger time frames the best way to use this system? Best wishes pchess

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hello pchess and welcome to this thread. As I stated in my first post, this method was designed for the daily/weekly time frames. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
In this systems cases, the higher the TF, the more accurate your signals will be. It will take some patience but it's well worth it! And welcome aboard!

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Thanks for the replies I will switch to the dailies etc and try from there

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I apologize up front if this has already been asked. I looked thru the thread and could not find the answer. The 2ma crossover indicator that I am using (same name as you are using) does not send emails when turned to true. Is there an up to date version I am missing??? Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Hello cabbagepicker and welcome to this thread. I'm not sure about the email alert function because I'm not a programmer, and I don't use email alerts. Pm Fredella who is a programmer. I think he could help you.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Hi LGTJ and team on the forum -- I could have written much of your post one: can't sit at the screen all the time (or overnight), mixed success with small TF trading AND a belief that the higher TFs are where some significant rewards and high(er) successful strike rates should be found. I am not a rookie to forex but have not been able to sustain success. I will . . . So, glad to be here. My 'solution' to my para. one above has been to follow higher TFs with Ichimoku which does work BUT gets to the trend following quite late on a D1 or W1. I am hoping this approach might get one in to solid trades sooner. My early investigation says, 'yes.' All of you have every right to expect me to read the 600 or so posts, and I am well into it. My 'hole' is the middle group of postings. Observation. I'm not quite sure where you are. That is, some have taken off indys and others have put things on from the original version and vision. IS THERE AN AGREED UPON OPTIMAL SET OF INDICATORS AT THIS MORE MATURE STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT? If so, could one of you graciously make an up to date restatement of those with their settings? I'll keep reading and start some set-ups on my screen, and by the way, just curious -- about how many positions are you finding on, say, the D1 per month? By its nature, I suppose this technique demands plenty of patience. Thanks to any responders! Greetings and best regards to all, Forest

--- 帖子 #603 ---
LG I see you are on-line now (1253 est). Quickly, it seems YOU have not modified your system (screen) much since the inception. Others have, of course. Implication here is you are still getting superior results. Fair statement? Best, Forest

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hello Forest-Sea and welcome to this thread. The new set up and rules are on page 24 post #346, but I suggest that you study and understand the original method's rules before moving to the new set up. Look over all of my charts and study them for understanding. Believe me there are plenty of charts . As to how many set ups per month, I don't know because price action is unpredictable. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Ah, a post in the middle. It's why I haven't seen it yet. Will follow your recommendation. Blessings, Forest

--- 帖子 #606 ---
You're welcome. I also forgot to mention this, the original rules are on pages 1 &amp; 2. Once you understand the rules and study my charts and explanations, then you'll be ready to move to new set up.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
LG and friends -- At the risk of deeply embarrassing myself, (oh well . . . ) it does appear that most entries could be made using (just) the RSI and MACD set ups at the bottom of the chart. While I surely agree attention should be given to S/R points, including TLs, it seems valid entries from the RSI and MACD have been pre-signaled from the 2MA and slope indicator. So when will these tools add value and information for you? The slope, in particular, will be pointing your way prior to the confirmation from the RSI and MACD (won't they?). I guess I am like some others of you. I kind of prefer a 'clean' looking chart WHEN POSSIBLE. Is it here? Many thanks for your thoughts and wisdom, Forest PS -- Of course, the reason here will be to keep out of less promising trades . . . perhaps I am wondering how often this purpose is achieved? PS2 -- OK, I did find an example where the 2MA FOLLOWED the RSI and MACD. So obviously, the 2MA does serve a useful purpose, although this might be infrequent. Help is help.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Sorry for the heavy load of questions. This will quickly subside. I must have missed it, but what 24 hour period is generally being used by you traders? Mine is currently set at GMT +1 around the end of NY trading. What has proven itself? Thanks, Forest ---------------------

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Not quite sure what it is your looking for... Are you looking for a particular DAY of the week that we look @ set-ups? If so, It could be everyday. If you are looking for a time WITHIN a day that we look for set-ups, I can tell you that MY daily candles roll over @ 5 P.M. Central time. So anytime after 5 I will look for valid set-ups that have formed over the day. Don't know if I understood ya correctly there Sea? If not, hit me up and let me know man!

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Your note helps. I guess whenever OUR D1 candle closes, mine at 3 pm PST,we take a look at possible positions. I had originally thought all might set up a D1 candle opening and closing at the same time to look at identical candles. Best, Forest

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Nail on the head Forest-Sea!

--- 帖子 #612 ---
If any one is out there, looks to me like we may soon get a qualified entry on the U.J. at around 90.50 high close of the daily bar that closed today. RSI and MACD look good, and the weekly trend has also turned up. Any barriers to entry? Possibly: (1) the 50 is not too far overhead, but room for some pips, (2) some [minor] resistence isn't for above. Forest

--- 帖子 #613 ---
The valid signal appeared on 2/12/10. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #614 ---
wait and see...

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Thanks, LG. I am trying to figure out why my Alpari MT4 platform did not yield a complete signal until today. I did get the arrow on 2/12 but the RSI 50 standard was not eclipsed until this candle closed. Unfortunately, the my chart is lagging at bit with seemingly the same settings (RSI = 8, MACD = 12,26,9). . . OK, I see you moved with your buy on a touch of the two lines. I thought we wanted to clear them. Bad reading on my part. Helpful! That would have moved my entry to 2/15 . . . better, at least. I don't want to be several days behind. Best to you, Forest

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I would guess that more likely than not it is because Lg uses IBFX which paints a Sunday candle....This does throw off daily indicator strategies a bit. Try to also D/L and load up the system in IBFX and see if it yeilds the same results as in Lg screen-shot. Let me know if this still does not fix the difference!

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Do you have the 2MA indicator properties set up correctly? When I started using this method my arrow was coming up at different points and realised that was the reason.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
2MA looks ok. Does seem to be the sneaky Sunday surplus candle. Thanks, guys, for your suggestions. Forest Hey, Short, time for you to hit the rack and grab some sleep Downunder.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Might really be for Zoot or Maklla (post 415 area) I noticed you did some smaller TF trading around the holidays. I know it requires more attention and it's not for huge pipshakes, but I am curious as to your comfort and level of success when you were at H1-H4-D1? I do have some NY trading time I could devote to this. My daily bar closes/opens at 3 pm (PST) so a little 5 am NY trading would be ok. Thanks, Forest

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Nice! For sure, we did do some lower TF stuff round the holidays. This was only because "Typical" PA is kinda out the window around that time. At the time I was only seeking quick 20-40 pip pops. In-n-Out This style also carried ALOT more risk though, as I'm sure you can see why. I would still recommend only following your Daily signals direction If/When dropping down to lower TF's. The Asian Open is more in my favorable time schedule, so this is the area (Market Opening) I traded these lower TF in most. It can be done, for sure, as long as you are still paying attention to and respecting the BIGGER (Daily/Weekly) trend that is making your H1 chart! Hope this answers any questions ya had.....

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Here you are, and thanks again

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Three months now with no posts? What happened to all the favorable comments and tracking of pairs? Where did everyone go?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
wah wah nice set up... read the thread ... come on guys keep this thread going.. i need to learn more

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Maybe they're all trading yearly charts now and will update you in December?

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hi there, Just wondering whether thread still active! Since last night I am reading it and must say it is wonderful. Just wanted to thank lgtf and Mrezoot for their contribution. Hope somebody will answer

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hello Ifee. Thank you for your comments. I haven't posted on this thread for a while, but the method is still solid.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Made more than 1000 pips in last month on demo using this system, despite a few early mistakes. Can't believe this forum is so quiet

--- 帖子 #628 ---
This method is STILL rock solid as it is based off of logical technical analysis. (cant go wrong there!) Even though Lg nor myself are here posting of it... If it makes pips... pip it! Lg and myself had gone on to create other threads and could simply not keep up with this one. By all means we encourage you to post some shots and get it stirrin again!! I'd love to bounce ideas off Lg again.. as I think were BOTH in different places now! Talk soon!

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hi pip chasers and Hunters ( A.K.A all traders ) Been looking at this thread for days. Really alot of Indicators here and there but seems very promising so far. Can any one currently using this systerm and have made a good trading profit from it confirm what indicators they are using the most as there are so many mentioned on this thread that it can easily get confusing, and what time frames too. Just need more clarification on the tools mostly. Thanks all. Sharemaster

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi Sharemaster and others -- This really seems to be a dependable winner on back test over many different pairs. I would love to see some revival of the thread. It seems at least a few of us are using it. I would suggest any new reader check out post #346, TGTJ's Improved Method. I find this works quite well on H4, although he recommends using it on D1. Of course, it will work there, too. I think you may find you will not wish to use as many indicators as originally posted when the thread began (Oct 2009). You should also make sure you read #453 and #499 which shows a successful drop down to the H1 TF with some of Mrezoot's mods. At any rate, there is a lot to like here. Let's do more sharing. This is a money maker. Forest

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Read post #355.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Dear Igtj, I am very interested in your method. I want to try it in the trade in precious metals. Have not been reported in this thread. This method is relevant now? You may be asked to download or send an e-mail (a.shushakov@gmail.com) latest relevant indicators and template. Thanks in advance. With kind regards and best wishes.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hello Baikal505. I don't trade this method anymore. I only use moving averages and price action now.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hello Igtj. Thanks for the reply. So this method was not working and can not now be used in trade? Best Regards.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Which method are u now using to trade? If u dont mind u can share it.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
This method can still work, I just don't use it. I've learned not to rely on so many indicators to make a decision to take a trade.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Dear Igtj, Thank you very much for your reply. Where do you ever talk about your method moving averages and price action? Best regards

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hello Opemipo. I use two simple moving averages to show me the trend and the strength of the trend. Then I wait for candlestick formation to confirm the direction of the moving averages. I would have to start another thread in order to explain the method in detail, but I don't have time right now.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
This system look good i will follow your thread but after download your indicator i could not see the 2ema with coloured can you pls provide it or do a complete template of all the indicators for downloading . Thanks

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Thanks so much for your quick reply. Pls, I beseech you by the mercies of the Lord, try creating time to put ur new system together. Having done that inform us in this thread the link of your new thread so that we can follow you. I love to learn from you. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #385 ---
This system works very well. Take time to study it then create your own way of trading it according to how it suits your time and emotional responses.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
It seems this thread is dead.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Dear Opemipo, Thank you very much for your reply. You use this method now? Best Regards.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Yes! But I configured it according to my temperament and time constraints. Study yourself and the time u ve available to trade fx, configure this system according to your taste, u ll be surprised! I may not like to tell u how I use it. It may not work for you. Yourself is the key to success in fx. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #389 ---
please can any one tell me where i can get template and indicators for mrezoot bottom_less pishake method

Is slope direction repaint? Can someone confirm this?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hi umairsheihk2, All indicators do repaint, everyone of them, there is no leading indicators for sure, always use PA for your trading decisions, Cheers!

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Dear lgti, After reading all these interesting entries - please do tell me what system you now use as I am really interested after this length of time. Thanks

--- 帖子 #393 ---
wow.. TF D1 and W1.. this technique for long term guys? thanks b4

--- 帖子 #394 ---
After having read through this entire thread, I want to thank you guys for giving a forex newbie a break through all your sharing. I have researched countless systems and this one seems to truly fit my trading style. Am about to test it out in demo...just so sorry everyone has departed. Thank you all so very much.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Why rush? Lots of time to make $$ Better signals...

--- 帖子 #396 ---
