Hi Traders, I have been forced to find an indicator / indicators that actually work and a that a person new to trading could easily understand and start to profit in a short amount of time.Why? As most of you are aware my health is poor and I will not be around forever. I want to make sure my wife, Daughter, grandchildren will be financially okay when I can no longer trade and finance there lives. I have been trying to teach my wife how to trade without indicators but it has been harder than expected. I showed her some indicators (Moving averages and Stochastic) and she started to get a grasp of trend and where to place trades. So I thought I would post the trading system here for you all to evaluate and use if you wish. I have traded this system live for two weeks and it has returned 17% which I am happy with. The indicators used are: DTosc and 5 SMA High 5 SMA Low Chart is 15m Bar Chart More to follow Attached File(s) Pivot_Voty.ex4 75 KB | 790 downloads | Uploaded Feb 9, 2025 3:32pm Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) #DTosc.mq4 2 KB | 1,647 downloads Template

I have found that When the DTosc crosses it will head in the same direction long enough to grab some pips. The rules are. Trade around market opens DTosc has crossed Price has closed inside the SMA bands I have been using support and resistance levels to take profit. I have used an initial 20pt SL and 30pt TP but adjust these when the trade is open. Nothing new here just trying to get some daily pips I'll post my trades next week

Thanks for sharing! Please continue.

Order of trade validation. For short trades. 1. Market has been trending up (trading to the top side of the 5 SMA high) 2. Price will usually spike up then close under the upper band. This is the first thing I look for. 3. If DTO has already crossed down, I open a sell position on the bar close under the upper SMA. 4. if DTO has not crossed I wait until it has crossed on close and sell that bar. You don't have to be exact. Just follow next week and I'll show you how it works.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Trade example. Take a look at your charts with these indicators. Just follow the trades this week, have a go if you want. I won't be answering many questions as it is so easy. Just grab some pips. 5, 10, 15, 20 what ever suits you. Don't make it difficult. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attachment g

A bit like the "Roadmap" strategy of Laura's https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...o-read-markets What is the DTosc please - I have Ninja trader at present? but, if I can, I will use it in conjunction with her approach, to see if it improves trade selection albeit on a smaller time frame on the SP500 Micro Future. Great thread Islander and thank you for sharing your ideas.

All indicators “work” in the sense that they display accurately what their programmed instructions tell them to display. Whether they help you to develop a genuine, verifiable edge is another matter. D.T.Osc (dynamic trader oscillator) is basically another name for a variety of “Stochastic RSI”. It’s available free for both MT4 and MT5 from indicatorspot.com, for anyone wanting to use their version. I wish you good luck with it, of course, but it’s certainly no holy grail, I’m afraid - to put it mildly.

Aha.... I might have found it? https://www.prorealcode.com/prorealt...this%20website .

--- 帖子 #12 ---
thanks for this simple trading approach! as i trade european time, i will have a look at the openings of london and frankfurt. what i noticed is that the indicator looks a bit different from yours (below is the USDJPY chart). can you please tell me if you use the same variables? thanks!

The Holy Grail is YOU, not an EA, Indicator or even a little Alert....

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You're not entirely wrong, but you're not completely right either. An indicator—or any other tool—won't magically turn you into a profitable or professional trader. Think of it like a chef in the kitchen: a novice cook could have the finest knives and utensils at their disposal, but that alone won't make them a Michelin-starred chef. However, an experienced chef knows how to fully utilize those tools, enhancing their efficiency and elevating their craft. The same principle applies to trading—it's not about the tools themselves, but how skillfully you use them.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Which support my statement - YOU are The Holy Grail. No tool works without a Human Being, no sport, no job, nothing on the planet Earth works without a Human Being - The Grail. Amen.

Will Ninja Trader web import this indicator?

Love your work on TV, can you turn this into one indicator for ease

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Its easy.. I just need to add the sma high/low to it. The "Strength Meter" I have added to the Oscillator doesnt want to work the way I want it to yet though. Glad you like my work

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I am pretty sure the planet "Earth" would work a lot better WITHOUT Human beings. IN fact, this planet is being destroyed more and more, to the point "we" are searching already for a new planet to infiltrate. Nonetheless, you ignore 2/3 of what I said and interpret the rest into your favour. If you want to start a new culture/religion you should go to a different website. Instead of posting useless comments on other Peoples threads. BTW this is underneath the Section "Trading Systems" where People post.. ah whatever. Why am I even wasting my time.

Take your time. I also want your template. Very clean

Here is Robert Miner's description of the DT Oscillator: "It is a stochastic of an RSI. Then it takes a moving average of that product and then a moving average of that moving average so we end up with two lines." As an example of one of his standard settings of 13, 8, 5, 5, the inputs are RSI Length: 13, Stoch Length: 8, MA 1 Length: 5, MA 2 length: 5. I doubt there is any magic to this oscillator that can't be conjured by a more readily available indicator already loaded into Ninjatrader. I'm not at all meaning to disparage the OP or his system. But in the end, it is just an oscillator. turnip, Ninjatrader will let you apply MA's to indicators. I'm a bit busy right now, but I'd be happy to try to "build" this for you using multiple indi's. It won't be as easy a set up as actually coding it (which is way beyond my current skill set). However, once it is done, you could simply save it as a chart template to preserve it. Once and done. If I can make it work, I'll post it here for you. If I don't post anything, you'll know I've failed.

Looks like Lorenztian Classification candles

--- 帖子 #27 ---
oh right, they kinda do! completely different script though. Developed a Bands/Channel Indicator, which I then made into an Oscillator. And those Candles are coloured based on that Oscillator!

Interesting, go on! What are your preferred time market and pairs?

To know how to trade with the DTOsc indicator which dates back to the 80s when it was first introduced, study this book and learn to develop your own trading system with the content in this book. whether you can make money with it depends on you as the trader. Attached Image (click to enlarge) ...

Trading times are at market opens. Monday morning can be slow, it just depends on news. I'll do some live trades this week around the Asian Session and London Session and post the results.

Robert Miner’s High Probability Trading Strategies focuses on a structured, rule-based approach to trading. Here are the key takeaways: Four-Dimensional Analysis – A trading strategy should integrate multiple factors: price (Fibonacci levels), pattern (Elliott Wave), time (cycle analysis), and momentum (oscillators). Trade Plan &amp; Execution – Emphasizes predefined entry, stop-loss, and target levels before executing a trade. Momentum Reversals – Uses momentum indicators to confirm trend shifts before taking trades. Practical Strategy – Introduces a step-by-step process, including multiple time frame analysis and trade filters for high-probability setups. Risk Management – Stresses position sizing and stop-loss placement to protect capital. The book is technical but provides a systematic, rule-based framework for traders who prefer structured decision-making. I just saved you a lot of time

On the following charts I have plotted support and resistance on 30m time frame chart. It was a low range trading day yet there were plenty of trades to take. The 2nd chart I have just changed the 30m chart to 15m so you can see the entries. on the last chart I have adjusted the vertical lines on the DTosc to show the system entries. I am not interested in taking trades that have shot past the SMA bands as they are likely to pullback. Just take trades where price has closed inside the bands, they trades are better value. What you do with this system and how you interpret / trade it is up to you. If you have anything to add please post ideas / results.

I trade AU, AJ, UJ, EA, GA during the Asian Session. I usually have made my $ for the day during the Asian Session so don't trade London Session. If I trade London Session I will generally look at the above and include GU and Dax I am not a high volume trader, I am looking for the best entry setup out of the bunch. If you cannot make pips out of one pair you will not make it trading all the pairs at once. I'll post my trades this week and you will get the idea. I'll probably take a few duds but that happens to the best of us. I'll post the duds as well.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Vidvad, Thanks for your input. I am a seasoned trader and have a good understanding of indicators. I actually, despise them. This system is for my wife to trade and she needs indicators (for now) I will not be offended by anyone's comments. I may be completely wrong but that's okay. I'll have some fun trying it out this week. This type of trading has been done 1000 times before, I am aware of it, I am just trying to put my spin on it. All the best Rob

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi, I'm a fan of DTOsc, I use mainly on the daily and weekly time frames for longer term trades, where I use different setttings. For your strategy it seems you dont take into account the 75 and 25% levels on the oscillator. I wondered if you found its not relevant for your strategy. Also is M15 your preferred time frame and do you take into account other time frames, higher or lower before entering. Thanks

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Axe, I have never been one to conform to indicator rules. I am not using levels on the DTosc as not required for this system. I will only be trading the 15m timeframe. You will get the idea this week when I post the trades. I will post every available trade on as many pairs as possible. If anyone wants me to look at other pairs like Nas, EG UC let me know

--- 帖子 #37 ---
thanks for that....I've had a look at it over the last 24 hours or so as I trade/scalp BTCUSD on M15. Mixed results but of course very low volume. Will be experimenting through the week and will lok at session opens. Thanks

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Please include EJ and GJ. Thank you for starting the thread and helping other traders! All the Best for you and your family

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Axe, Here is the BTCUSD trade for today. I don't see anything else on the chart. This is a good example of why you need to enter the trade within the bands. If you chase the market your RR goes out the window. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The DTosc was heading up so I wound not have had any issues buying on the downward bar where I have plotted arrow. Another confirmation of why you should enter the trade where arrow plotted is because it is a retest of the breakout. This can be seen clearly on the line chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Will do

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Just to clear something up regarding the trade setups (Entry Rules) The DTosc and price closing inside the bands does not have to be the same bar close. Sometimes the DTosc will come first, you just have to open a trade in the direction of the cross when price is within bands. I will be using 30mm SnR and Pivots for TP

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thanks for that.... Do you consider any divergence with DTO? BTC Attached Image (click to enlarge) USD M15

--- 帖子 #43 ---
More on the BTCUSD Trade. I have plotted 4 vertical lines on DTosc showing possible entries. So which is valid and how do you trade them? To start with Cross 1 is the first valid trade. The next thing you have to ask yourself is where do I want to TP? I mentioned I use Pivots / SnR to TP (This does not always work) When trade is opened I use an initial SL and TP size and amend to suit TP's near pivots. This is based on daily range. So if I had entered a trade at cross 1, I want the market to go some distance to give me a decent profit. I would not be looking to go short at cross 2 because it is trading back towards the bullish breakout. Could I add in at cross 3. No, because price took off. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In the following chart there is a cross 4 and cross 5. The question you are all asking is what are the valid trades. My view of cross 4 is, TP 2 was reached from cross 1 trade, so why do I need to place more trades. However I would also be looking at a double top which would make me more inclined to give cross 4 ago. It is also down to market timing (Opens) whether I would trade it. I would be asking myself is cross 4 at a market open, if yes I would take it. The same applies to cross 5, as to the timing regarding market opens. These are just things to consider when you think about opening a position. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I have not traded divergences with this system however, I am aware of them and have been plotting them on a long term research chart to analyze at a later date. I do not trade BTCUSD and the charts I have posted are just how I would trade it if it was on my list. I hope you see things how I see them and the charts have been useful. All I can say is I, you or anyone else that trades this system will make mistakes, have some great wins and losses. Don't take it too serious it is not that complex as you will see this coming week.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thank you for interesting discussion. This is just to point out for any Tradovate users here that the Stochastic RSI contributed by LDT is in fact the DT Osc or, as LDT puts it, "supports multiple moving average types." Here 15m Bitcoin with 13, 8, 5, 3.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Just a couple more examples. From some of my actual trades I have posted you will notice that I did not always get the trade opened within the bands. This can occur due to slippage, spread and me ducking away from the computer. The point here is to see the signal and act on it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #47 ---
It would be a lot more interesting to know when you DONT take a Signal. The Signals can be very solid, but if you are taking every Signal based on what you show.. your Account wont have too much fun. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Cog, I will be posting and discussing my trades, signals and why I take certain trades and not others. With your skills I expect you will have a working profitable TV version of this system in no time. If you find that you can produce an indicator for TV / MT4 / MT5 I would appreciate it if you share it freely. I will be happy to help you fine tune the system parameters. The entries on chart you have posted does not comply 100% with this system. Can you post the same chart for AU, AJ, UJ, EA,GA, EJ and GJ and I will have a look at them. Regards Rob

[COG] StochRSI Ultimate Pro+ https://www.tradingview.com/script/Dl6KaUz2-COG-StochRSI-Ultimate-Pro/ Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have published the Script. @Islandfx911, if you got Tradingview, please check it out to discuss stuff further. I have NOT Coded the Signals when Price goes OUT of the "Bands" and then back in. Only the breakouts. Reason: Not sure how to filter those Trades properly out yet, without having 100 Signals on the Chart. I could add a Trend filter, but nothing of that kind got discussed in here yet and I want to add too much of my own stuff, when its supposed to be based on this Thread.

Hi Cog, I only trade certain pairs during certain market opens, therefore as this is GU I would only look at opening a trade during the build up to market open and 1 - 1.5hrs after the open. There were two valid signals however with big US news on the way I would not have traded the 11.15 Sell. I have marked the times to start looking for GU, EU, EG, Dax trades being 8.00 through to 11.30. I have found that nothing much happens to the European pairs out of these times. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is the AU chart showing the times of interest and trade entries. You would therefore only have two valid trades on AU and one on GU Attached Image (click to enlarge) The setup validation has been posted earlier. Regards Rob

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Regarding the entry. I am not a coder but I will try to explain it. Bearish entry if DTosc has crossed down and closed and price has closed inside the 5SMA bands and the market hours are (as I explained certain pairs at certain times) I'll use AU as an example and the terminal time is between 1.00 and 4.30 then sell on close. It is irrelevant that price has traded outside the bands. Inside the bands offer a value trade. If you are trading a band breakout you have lost your edge.

alright, thanks! that makes it more clear. Will keep you updated.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
thank you for your explanation. so i will try to look only for signals on GU, EU, EG and maybe DAX and avoid EJ or GJ because their opening time is far too early for me, because i am trading from europe. i will also add looking at USDCHF and GBPCHF because they seem to wake up also after frankfurt&amp;london open ;-)

Hi Cog, Great work. Just so everyone is aware of the entries on the chart, only the two sells are valid with this system due to time of trade. Regards Rob I don't use TV however if it is possible to add a time of trade filter it would be very useful as it would eliminate the invalid trades.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
If anyone is interested. I'm watching AU and AJ for a buy if they close inside bands. Things can change though as the market opens and gets going. They may fill the gap and reverse and I will then look at selling

Mate, indicators do not "work". You, the trader, must learn to profit from your chosen tool. Make sure you have sound risk management and money management, first. Then go find your indicator or method. Develop your entry criteria and trigger. Now you have a plan. The last step is to work on your brain so you neither hesitate nor rush. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi TS, I already have a profitable system that does not use any indicators. This system is to assist my wife as she is new to trading and she prefers indicators. Indicators to me are misleading, I prefer support and resistance and break and reverse of key levels. I am posting this system as I found it has a profitable edge. It is for others to learn from. Even if it goes belly up there is always a lesson to learn Regards Rob

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi TS, You are a smart enough trader to know everything about risk management. I really am not interested in discussing this topic. I said I would post all my trades this week. The charts will have all trade information on them and I will discuss my reasons for taking the trade. Hopefully this will be enough. AU trade is 3.4:1 RR if TP reached. 1% Risk per trade

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Saying -"make sure you have sound risk management and money management first " implies he doesn't which can come off quite patronizing. Also saying - "indicators do not work", and "you must learn to profit from your chosen tool, then go find your indicator" implies he hasn't learned to profit from his tools which you don't know... you're blindly just assuming that he doesn't which is also patronizing. It's also contradicting.. you're saying indicators don't work, while simultaneously saying you have to learn from your tools first, then you can look for an indicator and it will work? I don't think you should blindly be casting your personal biases in this thread, that's what you have your thread for mate.

Hi Island. Good to see that your still going strong. I have a look at this one - would you say it could be a potential setup? EJ - at resistance - indicator topside about to go south - price also at daily pivot acting as further confluence for at sell. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Have entered a sell trade like this - with take profit at support and at the 38% daily pivot. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I see strength in EJ. AU was my pick for this session. AU may go up and hit SL EJ may tank down. I will look further into EJ and get back to you.

Hi Machine, You are a mind reader. I was just being polite to TS

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I am also in the AU trade - it might go up, but when I look at higher timeframes - 12 hour and daily - I am very bearish and there is also a bearish hidden divergence on the 12 hour, and a real bearish divergence on the 4H - so let's hope we are on the right side of the trades

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Many many Indicators are extremely usefull tools. They save time and analysis. Like all tools they need to be used correctly for a good result, results vary according to the skills of the person who uses the tool. Tools and indicators don't work by themeselves. Its all about expectations.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi TG, Nice move getting in AU. Win or lose it was a nice setup and higher time frame is bearish, we will have to wait and see. We usually get a move at the 400 - 4.30 close (Now) If we get a drop through minor support I will asses trade to maybe got to break even. Price is to close to my entry at the moment and all I would be doing is increasing the chance of being stopped out on a good trade.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Sometimes the reader misinterprets. It is better to ask questions rather than assuming negative intentions and coming to false conclusions. If indicators "worked" then who would lose? You have to learn how to use your tools not learn from them. The chef example clearly illustrated what I said. There is no bias in what I wrote, Mate. Perhaps a look in the mirror will show where the bias originates. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I am smart enough to look to learn from others. That's why I perused your new thread. I apologize for any misunderstanding or miscommunication. Cheers, Mate.

When to place trades? I mentioned 'Trading in the Dead Zone' in my other thread. It is a period when market activity is very low. It is best to stay out of the market during these times. This system works because it has rules on when to be in the market and what you should be trading. Make sure you understand this and your trading results will improve. The details of what to trade and when have already been posted.

Hi Traders, I wanted to discuss my AU trade from this morning. The system gave a short entry at resistance and gap was filled. AU was overall bearish. I placed a short trade at 0.62615 SL was set at 0.62685 (-7) I used the Pivots for my TP at 0.62375 (+24) 3.4R My plan was to go to breakeven at 0.6245 however while in the trade support was becoming evident at 0.6254 and a base was formed and market traded higher. I tried to get out at breakeven but did not get the chance. Outcome of the trade was -1 Pip Overall I was happy with entry These are the setups to look for, not all will work out.

I've had Robert Miners software since 2010 and trade using Indicators Including the DTosc, since that time When you properly set Indicators they TRACK price cycles, the price cycle is what makes the money So when you build an Indicator that tracks price cycles, it will work - doesn't have to be the DTosc, they ALL will work the same I would read Miners High Probability book - It is a treasure trove of Information I would also read whatever you can get your hands on from WALTER BRESSERT - Miner got his ideas for the Indicators from Bressert! Bressert basically used a double smoothed stochastic to time price cycles - Miner has a double smoothed stoch in his software I just use a basic stochastic Indicator and have been hugely successful for 15 years, I have a very high win rate and a decent R value One thing I will say is if you try to use any Indicator in the WRONG trend direction it won't work, if you use any properly set Indicator in the direction of the RIGHT trend, it will work PERFECTLY This trade is from last week - Trend was UP = buy when the Indicator turns bullish! How hard is it! If you try to catch tops and bottoms, your win rate will suffer Attached Image (click to enlarge)

UK time Micro Futures. Not too shabby And worth looking into for myself at least. Low time frame though - 3 mins. Take note of time.

As an aside to my post I see no reason to stop me using Ninja Brokers ( My current Futures broker) for execution and TV for charting ?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
If you are trading CME micros and not CFDs you should be fine. I use Ninjatrader for charting and TopstepX ( a private label TV) for trading lol. I use NT for charting and trading my personal account.

Thanks COG. I know my time frame is much lower than those debated here , the 15 minute and above it seems. Therefore I will monitor Islands approach on the three and one minute Index Futures ( SP500 usually for me). Thanks to both of you for a really interesting and useful thread.

Hi Turnip, I think this thread will be great. I had an average day today. I made some $ but I got distracted looking at TV (That's Trading view not TV watching the Superbowl) and talking to Cog. Actually I was watching the Superbowl I will be more focused on trades tomorrow and will do my best to help Regards Rob

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Thanks Island. I have posted a one minute chart of SP500 as well as the above. I think that the one minute is messier but ( noting time - I am in the UK and look from 2:30pm) one still has a trade. It just seems that the 3 minute keeps your finger off the trigger until a decent opportunity forms. And time reduces your trade count to those taken around my first two hours of USA open. I only need a handful of points to be happy. No Superbowl here, just a grey, cold snow threatening sky.

It is all down to timing and knowing the characteristics of the market you trade. You have a good understanding of trading. All will be well

Hi Machine, I had a look at 5m Gold. It looks like it is rolling over and there was also some resistance above. Just my thoughts.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I'm showing some great scalping opportunities. Taking profit within 1-2 candles, when price touches the band. Long term, not sure which way it will go, but I like aggressively attacking positions with the signals. Ofc you have to have razor sharp spreads with your broker though, that's just how it goes on LTF scalping

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Are you using 5m to scalp The band trading is not my idea. I did a trading course many moons ago and it was based on the bands. I just combined it and now have this. The trader always took 1st profit at the bands.

Not with system currently, just observing. I've used M5 to scalp tons though.

[quote=Thtpro;15144708]I've had Robert Miners software since 2010 and trade using Indicators Including the DTosc, since that time When you properly set Indicators they TRACK price cycles, the price cycle is what makes the money So when you build an Indicator that tracks price cycles, it will work - doesn't have to be the DTosc, they ALL will work the same I would read Miners High Probability book - It is a treasure trove of Information I would also read whatever you can get your hands on from WALTER BRESSERT - Miner got his ideas for the Indicators from Bressert! Bressert basically used a double smoothed stochastic to time price cycles - Miner has a double smoothed stoch in his software I just use a basic stochastic Indicator and have been hugely successful for 15 years, I have a very high win rate and a decent R value One thing I will say is if you try to use any Indicator in the WRONG trend direction it won't work, if you use any properly set Indicator in the direction of the RIGHT trend, it will work PERFECTLY This trade is from last week - Trend was UP = buy when the Indicator turns bullish! How hard is it! If you try to catch tops and bottoms, your win rate will suffer {image} how exactly are you using rsi 2 please?

... Ignored It's FAST, but in the right circumstances it catches cycle tops and bottoms TREND UP then pull back to 25% or lower in RSI2 = CYCLE LOW "IF" the trend is still UP - you can wait for a 533 Stoch to cut out false signals or you can widen stops to allow room to move etc True double/triple bottoms it will bottom out on the turn, ticks UP = BUY on the break of the prior bars HIGH I could show hundreds of examples, but I only ever screen shot a few per week when I remember too, some of these are old Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is my fav way to use it on DAILY TF: Entry was green line, stop red line - self explanatory really Attached Image (click to enlarge) The key to all this is understanding that price is NOT random, it moves in cycles, those cycles happen on EVERY time-frame and that gives you predictive powers and Indicators will bottom or top accordingly I've said this for years - All you have to do is WAIT for picture perfect set-ups to show up on markets, risk 1% per trade and you easily make 2%+, doing that once or twice per WEEK allows you to double or more an account based on 44 trading weeks of the year Also think about the HIGHER time-frame Indicator - a WEEKLY cycle LOW is going to result in a nice move UP on the lower time-frames - again this is in Miners book If you trade these Indicators in the wrong conditions, you will get dud results - like taking every turn of the Indicator is a sure recipe to going bust Hope helps

I believe I know why..I have copied a visual style for the confluence meter (I just thought it looked cool), but I guess they considered it too close to the original. Tradingview is very strict with such stuff

--- 帖子 #159 ---
In DT charting software as well the DTosc, Miner also included a DT Stoch, which is a double smoothed stochastic - its not as Erratic as the DTosc You can use that to time cycle highs/lows Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not shown, but you can mess about with the settings and use it to match BEAR market lows, which gives you predictive powers and one hell of an edge over everyone else Remember all that is happening is the Indicator is TRACKING market price action CYCLES, which gives you an edge, the ability to time most tops/bottoms and profit You can use ANY Indicator to do that, but the DT suite of Indicators work a treat, they have for 15 years for me and they will forever, because markets work out in price and time cycles and these indicators track those cycles nicely

--- 帖子 #175 ---
OP trades asian open mostly right, not NY, or both?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Turnip, THis is actually the reason why i brought up the HTF thing with Cog. Currently the M1 looks weak but even the M15 does not support it so no entry without HTF support Below 2 M1 charts, 1 with and 1 without HA candles. Notice the difference (sorry about the inclusion of the TDI, won't happen again) Please note that i'm not suggesting to use the HA in any way bc it is not part of the original setup, it is just something that triggered me (and is easy to apply in TV ;-)) W'll let Island decide whether exercises of this nature are ok.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
This short entry is OK? Bounce off R1 pivot is bonus.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
My biggest issue has always been that I don't get out before it's to late and hit my stoploss at full risk. This strategy and properly many other like it are actually essential very easy to use. But the psychological gameplay is super important. I have come to realise - after reading some of Islands reviews of his trades, that going break even is okay - and going breakeven in 10 trades is also okay - eventually you will hit the homerun that does 2-3-4% in a short move. I kinda knew this in the back of my mind, but have just failed to make it second nature. Putting stoploss to breakeven as soon as possible is Gold - and then we just have to wait for the big moves - if we get a big move it's better to just exit the trade and secure your profit with a happy smile on your face. Then rinse and repeat.

Precisely. Maybe even closer on the first one.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
But count the profit. In this case yesterday I exit at 1:2 taking 25 pips. It went to 1:5 at 125 pips. So I missed 3R. If I get the next 2 trades at 1:2 in stead of break even, then I have gained 1R already. So I am pretty sure, that there will be many BE's where you lose 2R waiting for the big run. Overall profit might be less that way. Taking the 1:2 every time is the secure way to profit. Money management. Don't be greedy. Just my opinion. Yours is just as good as mine. Sorry - this is another system, I just wanted to comment to this topic.

Hi Turnip, There are two systems combined here that work well together. Cog has done some great work to make is easier to trade. I guess what is required now is for the individual trader to apply there knowledge of the instruments they trade. For example I trade the Asian session, I trade AUD, JPY based trades because they suit that session. I like trading the 15m charts and I know how things work regarding the pairs I trade and that timeframe. What I will encourage you to do is post your charts here so we can work together as a team with other traders following this thread. I will set up a watch list in TV with your trading instruments and start to monitor the entries. Regards Rob

Something to think about when Trading with the StochRSI (DTosc) To put it into simple Terms that all can understand it.. Essentially the Script works well in Ranges. The Oscillator basically always assumes the Market is Ranging and takes Entries (or rather attempts to) take longs on the bottom of the Range and shorts at the top of the Range. So when you are in a strong trending Market with very little rebounds, then you get a lot of "bad" Signals. As its essentially keep trying to find the top of the range (in a bull Market). This is why this Strategy works very well in Forex, because Forex's nature is to search for a balance/equilibrium (a good price for both Currencies so to say). Compared to Stocks/Indice which generally seek a higher Price. You can still Trade all instruments and it of course also always depends on the Timeframe you are Trading, but you should keep that in mind when you are taking Trades using the Script.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
It works exceptionally well on any market, any time-frame if you use it in the right conditions and circumstances I've used it hugely successfully for 15 years - Financial markets ALL cycle, price cycles, properly set Indicators then track the price cycles with astonishing accuracy If you're looking for tops in an uptrend you will get burnt and if you're looking for bottoms in a downtrend you'll get hammered too I'm staggered that its taken this long for people to cotton on to it!

Any MT4 traders on here? Should I code some tools for us? Maybe getting an alarm on setups?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
more or less yes. i try to get to +20 pips quickly and rarely hold positions for longer. happy for the day with +20. my general rule is: it's better to spend less time in front of the computer than to make a big profit. after 2-3 hours my concentration wanes dramatically and i then need breaks. so if, for example, i have gained +15 pips on the first trade, i will quickly close everything at +5 pips on the second trade and go into the forest or listen to my wife;-)

--- 帖子 #277 ---
yes please! it would be very generous and a lot of help! for example an arrow when there is a trigger. sometimes you dont see it because the red line is only a fraction above the blue.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
personally i would skip this trade, because we are in an uptrend (more or less) but i dont know, its just from my observation that these trades are more risky.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
For me, there are more reasons involved on why I took the Trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Using the Range Heatmap I have coded. Not going into that though as its not included in Islands strategy. Edit: Of course it still might not work, but based on Maths my Coin is slightly weighted into my favour.

I will make an arrow and a popup message and a computer sound and a signal to your phone. Of cause you will be able to choose what to use. Servers are closed for coding in the weekend, so I will start at Monday. Maybe Tuesday it will be ready.

I hate Island -he is making me do more homework/study just when I thought I had found my forever trading approach Again I let 15 minute dictate direction etc and execute on the 5 minute. Warning I do not follow strictly the Island approach but take and adapt to my own needs. This is one of the few threads with any interesting content. Thank you Island. Will take a break now and get my nose down for some after trading study with the charts I save to my homework folder UK session was not so good but profitable overall. USA session much better. ( SP500 for both sessions on UK time) EDIT: and the 5 minute trade execution is still far better ( for me at least) than a one minute execution - less whippy/wiggly bits)

Is this the exactly same indicator as the one from Birdland? Then there is no need for me to make it.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Oh, I checked. It gives arrows at all crosses. That is not signals.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
My default Plan for each Trade is going for 1:2R. When the Market gets too slow around my Entry I go either out or put my stop to breakeven. Else I dont touch my Trade. I personally dont care if I could have 10pips or whatever. I have a TP and if it doesnt reach it, then its just how it goes. Losing is Part of the Game. Its a long time investment. keep it simple. let the Math work itself out.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
OK. I suggest to make the signal robot in 3 phases. Showing the signals as they appear in accordng to posts 1-3. Ability to filter out signals that are contrary to the trend according to post #279. Ability to filter signals in according to row 1 and 3 on post #293. 2 and 3 will be traders choice. Release the robot for test after each phase. Should we name the signals: B A A+

I don't have the DTosc in my trading platform, I have to export the price data out into the DT software that I own, which is sometimes a bit of a pain to do, when you just want a quick scan of markets But as mentioned previously, you can make any Indicator replicate the DTosc (within reason), so I just use a 533 Stochastic, as it will give you the turns - I mention this as the next charts show the Multiple Time-Frame Momentum strategy in action on screen shots that I took at the time, to show to you that in the right conditions it works beautifully and they show multiple Indicators for reference Every Saturday I do a scan for markets in my trading universe which are sub 25% on the fast line of the 533 WEEKLY Stochastic - this pulls through a list of markets that "could" be in a position for a PRICE CYCLE reversal - the market structure also has to be there, so its not a blind purchase based on the position of the stoch Indicator In these examples the DTosc would be replicating the Stoch (within reason) if shown Now I am a complete Gann fanatic - but that's another story - the main thing is with market structure double and triple and fourth bottoms occur etc anyway, in this WEEKLY chart we find a chart that has the Stoch in the sub 25% zone, we also have multiple times that price has been in this price zone too - with multiple times that price was sucked into this zone and bounced from it with some nice moves, all coinciding with the stoch/dtosc etc being in the right position to reverse You could buy the weekly bar Attached Image (click to enlarge) or you could buy the daily bar Attached Image (click to enlarge) or you could buy the hourly chart on the 10th Sept 2024 - you get a stoch bull reversal on an Elliott Wave 2, Gann Secondary reaction, Higher Low, whatever you want to call it - you could buy the bar or a break of the swing high Attached Image (click to enlarge) Anyway, when EVERYTHING is in place, you get these types of moves and results - I just used the stochastic rather than the DTosc in these examples, but the principles are the same and shows perfectly multiple time-frame momentum trading on a different method to what you guys are looking at, but I wanted to show you its valid in the right conditions PRICE CYCLE at LOW, 3 Momentum time-frames at lows = Bounce of some magnitude is ultra high probability You've probably done your own stochastic research and concluded that its a load of old crap - it is, the reason for the poor results was that you weren't catching the proper PRICE CYCLE TURNS - when you do your results in terms of win rate and profit will rocket I can't tell you how many times I've exploited this method over the years, but its a lot - its not my best system for R profit but its up there in terms of reliability and a high win rate Good luck to you guys on your journey

Hi CogAlpha. I still have your original indicator from Tradingview installed and doing my backtesting, I have sampled a strategy with a very solid success rate using 1:2 risk setting stoploss behind the previous candle that crosses - but only if there is green confluence on the indicator. Sometimes i enter the marked much later when confluence turn green. Stoploss is then smaller and take profit is closer and it works for me in my backtesting. What is the data behind the confluence meter. I have tried to find a seperate indicator for this or setting up some moving averages, but i'm not able to manufacture it like yours or find anything that matches. So since it's not on tradingview any more, I would just be able to have a backup solution with the strategy since it for me personally give me a bigger edge and I would like to be able to continue with this if something happens with the indicator

Hi Andrew great post here thank you for posting, excellent. I think Im kind of doing the same with the three zigzag here on H4. three waves shown with 12, 24, 48 zigzag. and this week on GU the higher low came on H4. it was a 2 wave reading on H4 blue 24 zigzag and a 3 wave reading on H1 then the great value of this system comes in play with this really nice entry chart from Islandfx911 then On M15 I use a falling wedge / channel and the break of that with candles / line chart with M or W pattern. I also have Jake Bernstein MA channel with the 10 highs and 8 lows, but really it is very similar to the 5 highs and lows used here.

Hi Traders, I guess a few of you are keen to get started this week with this system. I have been sitting on the sidelines reading the replies and different ideas you have been discussing. All your ideas are welcome and worth discussing. You will note that my charts are very basic. That is the way I like to trade. The more you add to a chart in regards to indicators it will give you a different view of the trade setup you have been observing. Some use indicators for a confidence boost before they enter a trade. Some traders have multiple indicators telling them exactly the same thing and they still fail. if 1, 2, 5 or 10 indicators are saying the market is going up and it instantly reverses and stops you out it will put huge doubt in your mind when it comes to placing the next trade. That is why there are so many indicators for you to choose from. There is one indicator in play here along with an entry condition and that's all you need. Birdland's charts / trades were well selected and managed RiskFighter is looking at creating an robot for the system Cog has written the script for Tradingview Turnip said he hates me Machine is scalping like a machine, don't get And we have some Gann Fans (Pardon the pun) joining in So, there are a lot of ideas floating around. I look forward to reading your posts this week. Something I was thinking about over the weekend while I was writing some notes on the system is I rarely discuss my bad habits. I think bad habits and how we overcome them is important and worth discussing. When I first started trading I had the following bad habits. 1. I was greedy 2. I try to hit home runs with every trade 3. I fail to get out of a trade when it is clearly reversing. Guess what, I still have those bad habits but I have overcome them by creating new positive habits. So moving forward, remember a squiggly line on a chart means nothing if you don't have discipline to follow the rules and beat your bad habits. Regards Rob Trade well.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Turnip said he hates me Not true - just kidding And whilst 1 and 2 are important points, point three is lethal to many traders who stare at the screen willing price to reverse to avoid a loss. I use "Roadmap" as mentioned before and have my "get out cos you're wrong" points. Some people could try the approach to trading psychology that she advocates in Post 17 of the attached link: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...just-a-journal ? Just substitute your own stop levels/condition and try for 100 trades. Some will be amazed how the reality of being in a trade will freeze your ability to act. Island has a great approach, imho, and I am helping myself to bits of it to see if it improves my hit rate etc. Island is right that "simple is best" - no one knows where the price is going but it is nice to have an approach , like Islands, that's keeps itchy fingers off the button, that reduces your number of trades;And that, overall, gives you an edge. Never mind if your moon is in Uranus or the twelve indicators you use point to the Ides of March; just know where to get in and where to get out AND know when you are wrong. EDIT: Bear in mind I am trading 15 minute (direction) and 5 minute execution charts, on Indices (SP500)whilst trying to utilise Islands lower indicator. Look at Islands and Birdland's 15 minute charts combined with Islands lower indicator. The higher time frame seems to work well for them. I might quietly shove that approach into my tool box for higher time frame stuff. Magpie -thats me.

There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. 5. Every moment in the market is unique.

So the SignalRobot will watch these four instruments for the rest of the day. Let's hope it works. In the meantime I will begin coding some mft functionality, so that we can trade with the trend. I suggest to let the robot watch the DTosc in some HTF. Agree? Or better ideas?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Very nice effort. Is it safe to assume y'r coding in mql5?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
yes, my opinion for m15 the next relevant HTF is H1 regarding DTosc. and for m5 i think it would be m30. but thats me. also i watch several templates to see the bias, the dominant trend. but you cant programm that. its a discretionary thing. look at one template i use since years to get an orientation of the trend on m15: today the MAs are flat so its a sideway market.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Nope. MT4. It is so much easier and I know it as my own pocket.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Super. For now I have allready made it with M15 watch also M30 and M60. M30 watch M60 and 240. And Yes - we need some range indication. The hardest thing of all. Because it should not prevent early entry of the trend.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
In the matter fact I think the SignalRobot must give signals whether there is a range situation or not. It must be up to the trader to decide to not take the trade.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
This means that first version of the robot is ready. I will follow it today and release it tomorrow if it behaves well.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
yes, of course. its not an EA you build...and that is good. my view of a range market is, i am allowed to take trades on both sides, but the TP will be smaller.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Here is a situation. According to OP the DTO cross gives the opportunity to trade, but we must wait until price close below MA. (for a short trade). In this case the bar close below the MA 5 bars later. THIS IS a valid signal then. It is not the robot doing anything wrong. Trader must be able to evalue not to trade this setup.

YES. I do watch all the market sessions Open and Close times. What is also important is that I watch every 4-hours trade window which is als the H4 candles Price Action. For example, now is the London open hour and the M5 retracement 'cycle' in this current 4-hour trade window. H4 looks like a bullish engulfing candle and now is the correction of that H4 bullish candle, the setup would be good if that is below the DTOsc level-30. Attached Image (click to enlarge) ...

First version of the signal robot (my 3rd version though) It is a robot - (but is not trading), hence it shall be placed in the Expert Advisors folder. The indicator "#DTosc" shall be in the indicator folder . Otherwise it will not work. This indicator you will find in post#1. An arrow occur when there is a cross on the DTosc - AND the bar closes within the 5EMA band. The robot measures further the 2 last bars. So if any of those 3 bars close inside the 5EMA band and there is a DTosc cross, then there will be an arrow. It appears a little clumsy close to the bar. That will be fixed in the next version. NOTE!! Because this is an EA, there will only be painted arrows when MT4 is on and it will not go back in time. This is the difference of Robots versus indicators. The coding is different on those two systems and I always use robots because it has some advanteges. I have included a multitimeframe function. It measure the 2 next upper timeframes. An arrow is painted only if the DTosc has the same direction on all 3 timeframes. This function is selectable. Further of painting the arrow, an alarm box occur on the screen when an arrow occurs. AND a notification can be sent to you phone. This way you don't even need to be present at you conputer. This function require that you have the MT4 on your phone. A cup of coffe in the garden is ok, when you bring your phone. At the setting you can write the instrument that the robot is placed on. This way you get that information in the alarms also. So if you overview multiple charts, this can be a little help. Let me know of errors and any filters that might be helpful.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
of course i'm going to test it out and i've just noticed that there are two arrows in a row. i've selected the setting without MTF filter. but generally good work! thanks!

--- 帖子 #379 ---
it will be more powerful using it with support from higher time frame or mtf.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
But then we can't make a difference, did trades toke trade off the HTF support, DTosc or combination of both. Effectiveness of DTosc should looked only from DTosc trade signals. The more people see the level more powerful it is.

one does not look at the htf dtosc to close for confirmation. the htf dtosc divergence level with price is enough indication. there is also a htf support level. so we are talking about htf level not confirmation. ie. a htf level with a ltf confirmation. the ltf confirmation has to be completed first before the htf confirmation appear. if one is to wait for a htf dtosc confirmation close, then one has to wait a second chance ltf divergence.

Hi Birdland I have some measures in the upper left corner of the screen. They must not contain only zeroes like on your screen. It shows, that the robot does not get any signals. Can you please send a picture of your log? I attach your measures and my measures.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
My point was as You wrote "...it will be more powerful using it with support from higher time frame ..." without htf dtosc. Looking only support from HTF + trading TF dtocs. Did "power" came from LTH dtocs or HTF trades who bought at support ? For me if price moves away from HTF level its because HTF level and LTH dtocs didn't play a role.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Watching the log gives some errors like this: They are always there. They come from the #DTosc indicator, but it works anyway. I can do nothing about those. That is not from my robot. But again, my robot works fine even if the indicator has this problem.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Do you have the #DTosc.exe in the root of your indicator library??

--- 帖子 #391 ---
ok, this is how the arrows are showing up on the GU m15 chart.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
There have been 29 downloads. Does it work for anyone? Or are there more traders that have the Birdland problem??

--- 帖子 #393 ---
no, its in the experts folder because you said

--- 帖子 #394 ---
there are 2 things in the htf. 1. the actual support resistant shown in price 2. the 2 levels of dtsoc showing divergence with price in the oscillator. oscillator latest level above previous. price latest level below previous. a pre warning. both showing htf levels. one in price. the other in the oscillator. the power comes when at a htf level , together with ltf dtosc confirmation divergence with price.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
He he, thats the problem. Here is what I said: It is a robot - but is not trading, hence it shall be placed in the Expert Advisors folder. The "#DTosc" shall be in the indicator folder. Otherwise it will not work. Right, we nailed it. Thanks Birdland.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
you always explain it so clearly and logically, great!

--- 帖子 #397 ---
ahhhh!

now i have another problem: it does not open, because its an ex4 file and not an mq4 file. what to do now?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I have the same issue: It does not show any values, but i can change the settings etc without problems. I believe i have placed the dtosc indicator correctly in the indicator folder and the EA in the EA folder. See screenshots.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
My robot DTOSC_3 shall be placed in the Expert folder. The indicator #DTosc shall be placed in the Indicator folder.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
yes i know now. as you see it is in the "indicator folder" but it is still not working. anyway, i will find a solution. thx.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
No my friend. I can see that you do not understand. You have placed my robot in the indicator folder. That is wrong. A robot must always be in the expert folder. Step number 2 is to secure that the indicator #DTosc is in the indicator folder. It will work - I am sure.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
aaaa - maybe you don't have the indicator #DTosc?? Then you of cause cannot understand what I am saying. Get that indicator in post#1.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
yes, i have a similar indicator called "DT oscillator" which i have long time ago downloaded...that causes the problem!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hello Birdland, If i may chime in .. As you can see you have a gray 'wheel' on your indi-label, this implies that it requires compilation. This only happens explicitly or when you open up MT4 and it starts looking for uncompiled files. May i suggest closing and re-opening MT4? I had exactly the same issue you did ;-) Cheers

thank you forex-nl, but my problem is now solved;-) the problem was that i used an older version of DTosc and not the version of island from page#1. so the expert was not correctly linked with the indicator. after that i restarted Mt4 and everything is fine running.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Exactly. And to all other viewers. It must be the correct indicator. This is the code line from the robot: DToscRed = iCustom(NULL, TF2, " #DTosc ",13,8,5,3,0,0,1); The name is in the line and hence it is ONLY that indicator that works. Thanks for the pioner work Birdland.

At this point there has been 48 downloads of my indicator. It would be helpful if we get some comments during the next days if it helps anybody - or we should just forget it.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I got it working now as well. I have opened a few different pairs and are letting it run on the M15 for those pairs with the MTF on, so I will report back to share my results. One thing i did notice, i'm also running the indicator in tradingview (the script that was shared), i got a few signals there which i did not get on MT4. Will continue to monitor that.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi RiskF, I'll do a 2nd chime today, though i'm currently pulling it through the tester ;-) For the comment section i would skip all decimals but 1 (makes it a bit messy with 10 decimals on) The two HTF bias TFs are great but may i suggest to make them variable. That way people can use their own HTF bias TFs instead of the two preceding the current TF. What if someone want an entry on M5 but base in on H1 and D1? I'll come back later after i have finished my tester adventure. Again, great effort. Cheer

--- 帖子 #413 ---
everything is working now, thank you! what strikes me immediately, could you place the arrows further away from the chart? it's harder to see the chart. they could also be smaller. and I will watch it more time to perhaps contribute some new input.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
I don't know what I am doing but keep to levels on 15 minute chart and 5 minute execution. Seems to work so far but another 98 charts should give me some idea Fear not intrepid traders, I will not post everyone. Especially now that I feel many posts have moved on from original OP's simpler posts. But I am not the sharpest chisel in the tool box though.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Keep it simple, like Island. People got taught as a child that you have to work hard to earn good money. Its not wrong, but you cant take that thinking into trading. At meast not into all apsects of trading. this System is super simple... so Traders subconsciously add noise to it... so its complicated and... rewarding. Now when they win a trade, its "earned". It feels a lot better now for their subconsciousness. 99% of times though this overcomplicating, makes the system less profitable and more confusing... even for the one that made it more complicated to begin with. So they move on and the cycle repeats. Also... analyzing the chart and writing several pages of explanation feels a lot cooler and more "professional". I call it the Traders masturbation. Your charts add more value to this thread, than most other posts. Less masturbation.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I use Dynamic Trader software, (DT oscillator). I took that trade on M5 this morning and got stopped out at BE. On Dt you can have several Settings, and the red or green bars, indicate, that the higher setting is OB/OS. Anyway, I use the software since decades, but this approach is very interesting. THANKS. Sorry for overcomplicating.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I noticed something else: when I switch from TF m15 to m5 or m1 and then i go back to m15, the arrows on m15 do not disappear from the lower TFs.

RiskFighter, Tack sa mysket for all your work and contribution. Question: Do I get it right that even if I check the "allow live trading" box in the robot's settings, it still will NOT trade itself. Does checking this box influence anything in the robot's performance? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
a suggestion: the arrows in the indicator window instead of the chart window.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I am not sure what you mean. But when an arrow has been placed, then it will be there no matter which timeframe you watch. And when you get back to M15, it is still there. The arrows will be placed better in a new version.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Aaah, a Canadian that speak swedish. Nice :-) I have used the EA technology to make this robot. It could therefore be made to trade. That is one of the many advances to use EA tech in stead of Indicator tech. But the signals are far from good enough to trade them all, so that will not be made possible by me. You still need a human brain to sort the signals. Checking the "Allowed" box has no influence what so ever.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Wow, I never thought about that. Let me try it.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi Island What do you think now? And what about the filter you mention? This is your thread and I am getting the feeling, that my signalrobot is getting maybe to much attention. I think it is vital that we keep exhanging signals and thoughts about your strategy.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Wow - it can be done. Not sure if we should do it, but let me play a little with it. Maybe I should make it selectable which window you want to use for the arrows.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Why not simply consider a vertical line that spans across the chart and indi window (just a different object type, could possibly be an input parameter line/symbol) Would comparable to the TV version of Cog ;-)

--- 帖子 #430 ---
And here we have a coder with a nice suggestion. And I we could make that as part of the selectable. But this is not thought to be a Rolls Royse, just a simple tool. Thank you for the idea. I will think about it. But still guys, we are using too little time to discus the subject of this thread now. Let us have some trades and some comments on the strategy.

Nice to be seeing some of the same trades taken here. I also caught GU in the afternoon and EJ. Just got 3 Buy signals for EU,GU and AU. I know this system takes into account the HTF trend, but today the trend felt more bearish than bullish for EU / GU / AU. On the other hand, the 2nd screenshot of EJ had potential for a great long i think (yellow circle) but I did not take it because i'm trying to test the performance now with just the entry signals.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Could you please explain why you ignored the previous two buy entries, I have the amazing filter made by cog but I am just trying to understand the rules around timing and which signals to follow

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Default, 4hr Timeframe. Works like a charm.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Are you being serious? Why on earth would I do that? I don't care for the red tick.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
You'd make a terrible detective. I'm guessing it's because I traded a system in a popular thread last year. I happened to be top of the trade explorer charts quite often and people must have followed me from that thinking it was a good idea to follow me. I can assure you that I don't know any of those people.

Dropped through support lines drawn pre -open. Not traded by me since I am looking at Islands indicator and price levels and throwing the ball for my dog. Looking good ( to me) Thanks Island

--- 帖子 #456 ---
P/L looks nice . But does not show an old short I forgot about !!! Sweated over it but the bounce up on that last big green candle saved the day. Islands indicator and a support level increased my confidence and a possible stop area. Anyway -a screw up by me but also salvaged by me. But learnt my lesson to concentrate on what I am doing and not roam the internet while trading.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Custom script that signals a pullback when price is below a swing low area and moving average, capturing turning points in momentum. Not sure if I'm sharing yet, I'd find a way to locate good pullbacks and apply the system to it

That sounds very interesting! How do you identify the pullbacks, using a specific moving average and identifying the recent swing low on the current timeframe?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I had 4 trades today, GJ Short 2x : 1 time win +2R, 1 time loss -1R (just now, maybe too tight stop, let's see) EJ Long: Closed it around +1R when I got a sell signal on both GJ and UJ. Also it moved up pretty quickly and then the COG was up at the top of slope so decided to close. UJ Short: 1.8R win Really liking this system so far. I have some alerts set for EU, GU, AU, EJ, GJ and UJ. Testing on the 15M on those pairs now. For TP i set at least 1.5R. Depending on momentum and obvious price areas like highs/lows, FVG's I may extend the TP further. So far the backtesting has a pretty high success rate.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
perfect! and the GJ loss could have been easily avoided! I highly advice against trading so late in FX!

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I agree with that GJ loss. But i'm doing it purposefully now to get some more data and stats because (i'm a data analyst ) so that always helps me understand the strengths/weaknesses etc of every system. Also, the EJ could have been a better RR if I would have faster in getting the trade in, i got the alert but was busy with something else so price was already going up, hence lower RR.

Hi Machine, Up to you if you don't want to share anything however I advocate generosity and helping ones fellow trader. Look at the work Cog and others have contributed. I fully understand though as I have sometimes been hesitant and protective of information. I feel we are all in this together. I've noted that a lot of the entry signals are on Cogs work are the impulse moves prior to a pullback. Regards Rob

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I rather set up my alerts for the entry signals and then decide whether the trade is reasonable or not. I dont know why you turn a chart that goes only up&amp;down into something so complicated. If you aim for 1:2R you need to only win 33% of your trades to be breakeven... your goal is to have a slightly weighted coin in your favour. This System gives you good entries. Now filter them by looking at the trend. Have we been going more up or more down? If you cant do it, ask a Toddler. He won't overcomplicate it. ..... stop the Traders masturbation and start trading. Don't be afraid of losing. Trading is like a business. Taking losses is a needed Business expense to grow.

Guys I paid a guy to make a TV indicator based on the already great work here. It has filters (ie SMA 200) to only trade with the trend, it also has pull back filter, money management features so it suggest lot size based on risk% and account size, TP, SL (horizontal lines) etc. Also other useful filters and alerts. Have a play with it.

Don't bother. The script shows everything as a potential pullback. 95% of the Entries given from our Script, will also be identified as a pullback.

Will do! I am now logging manual backtesting over february and live forward testing. Once I have a decent number of stats I will share those so that we can have a look all together (for those who are interested). Because I have the impression the system works really well. I am just trying to define the best trading moments further (times of day, before/after news etc etc).

Thanks for sharing your thoughts and reading of the chart! What are you identifying with those red and green boxes? Something like premium/discount zones? And the indicator/EA you have with the timeframe buttons etc, which one is that?

Update for today: 2 trades (running) GJ Short: 1.5R hit, let's see if it continues to the low for a 2R. UJ Short: Had some drawdown, which i expected as the signal came before LO and there was the Asia swing high. So my stop is above that. Let's see if it starts to break down now.

I don't want to interfere, but why don't you open your own thread and present your trading approach? we only want to discuss islands system here.

my trading approach is the same what Rob has been trying to teach since Feb 08. Rob has another thread "No Indicators Trading System". Perhaps my basic approach is too advance for many here. Too much time here spent on developing better tools, scripts, etc. and not spending time on multi-timeframe analysis. People need to open up their eyes and they will learn there is more than what an oscillator DTOsc only confirms what the price has done. ...

--- 帖子 #486 ---
you are basically right. i have been trading for more than 35 years and know that it takes more than just mindlessly following an indicator. and especially the newbies want to believe that you can get ahead without hard work. it is constantly sold to them in the consumer society. i have had many discussions, as i'm sure you have, which ultimately don't help. the smart ones will work on different levels anyway and incorporate the indicator into their system and develop it further. but 99% of the readers here on ff want quick solutions without a lot of work. let's keep them believe that...

So to sum it up. Island opens up a thread giving clear instructions how to enter the Market with HIS approach in HIS thread using the DTOSC indicator. And you come in HIS Thread to open up other traders eyes, by essentially ignoring the oscillator (great that you have it on the chart) and spamming your "advanced" stuff.

Good afternoon pipcruiser. Unfortunately, the script does not work, it gives an error in the code, or is it just me who has this problem? I couldn’t remember the password for my old account, I had to create a new one in order to write to you. All the best, and thank you for sharing your knowledge!

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Like I said. You do not understand my charts and how to read the candles. I do not ignore the DTOsc. That is a very old technical study by Robert Miner. That is an oscillator which response to the price action. It is lagging and can be a tool to look for entries. Nothing more than that. Tou are just another rookie trader behaving like many gurus with some programming knowledge using ChatGPT and the like,... Learn to read the candles on your charts. Start with Daily, then H4 before you jump into the M15 and look for osciallator signals for entries. That is trading blindly following oscillator signals. Here, below is XAU H4 and M5. #Learn to read the candles# &gt; learn price behaviour and what the oscillator is telling you. Attached Image (click to enlarge) ...

I agree completely with the fact that every trader should learn to read the charts and understand the candles/price action. That is what i've been focusing on for the last couple of years since I got into trading. What I noticed for myself though, through reading books like Naked Forex, Trading for a Living etc is that when learning to read the charts properly it may help to review your understanding and the price action in the market by having some indicator on the chart. Anyway, I'm interested to read your view on the charts (also came across your posts in a few other threads).

USD/CAD ... long almost stopped out and then hit TP Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Thanks. So here is the update. There were 2 more trades that I could have taken today (the GJ trade this morning was the last trade I took), the afternoon trades I put in the chart at the moment of occuring (like live trading, just without placing the actual order). There was another GJ short in the afternoon (blue arrow) for 2.6R until the COG/SRSI hit the bottom. And I actually missed the AU short in the morning because somehow I just missed the signal. That would have brought the total nr of trades at 5 today. These were all winners.

Well, a good session on the USA open on the SP500. But do you notice the indicator doesn't always go the same way as the price trend. My approach from the off was short but indicator showed long. It didn't effect how I trade but curious. Indicators indicate but the brain has to intercede - bad news for grail hunters Have I got the wrong indicator? Am I using it incorrectly ( if I was to rely on it more heavily) ? Is it likely the 5 minute time frame on indicies is not as effective as higher time frames on other instruments? EDIT: I note many of you are on 15 minute charts so maybe I am out of sync here !

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Its a combination of many things. 1. I dont think you really understand the calculation of the StochRSI/Stoch and why it shows what it shows. I would advice you to read up on the Stoch calculation. 2. You are Trading an instrument that moves very impulsive (London and NY open). This is generally a great thing for Traders, but it can be tough for a "Dtosc Trader" Why? go back to Nr.1 (I also started writing about it in this thread) 3. There is not really any Nr 3. You just dont understand the Indicator. Thats it. Your Bias was short, you got a clean Short on the retrace. Thats a potential 7R Trade. That would be enough for me. In fact I am pretty damn happy to have 7R gain for the Month. You could have got it in 1 Trade trading your bias with the Dtosc Script. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Excellent reply. I will take on board all you say. Thanks again Cog

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hi T, The way I use the indicator is the following. I look at the overall trend, lets say down as per your chart. I will enter a trade on a double top, a break of a rising ledge / flag, a close inside the upper band or a rejection candle etc. Once I see the initial DTO cross inline with trend I ignore all other crosses. You just need the initial cross then manage your trade. Regards Rob

I would read Robert Miners High probability trading strategies, because it details in there why The Indicator works of EVERY market, EVERY time-frame Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Let me show you the big picture stuff - We are ALL trading this Indicator in a similar fashion - I just apply a different set of analysis to my work than you guys using the MAC, but the overall PRINCIPLE is the same - we are all trying to catch REVERSALS of price action DAILY TIME-FRAME SP500 Index - You use it with the reversal of the Indicator, time counts/cycles, price levels, trend lines or gann angles etc - Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can even use it on MONTHLY Time-frames - Every time that DTosc heads below 30% you will have some sort of corrective or bear market low forming - some of them will be minor reversals, but most of them will be significant turning points depending on the4 market cycle in play at the time of the reversal Attached Image (click to enlarge) As I've previously stated - The markets are NOT random, they move in price cycle swings from ticks, 1 min, 5 min, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly etc etc - properly set Indicators FOLLOW those price cycle swings and as this Indicator syncs nicely with those price cycle swings, you can catch them at turning points - The Indicator works BEST following the direction of the price action cycle, so that would be an area to learn up on - so when that MONTHLY Indicator is sub 30%, the reversal move will be starting (when it starts) on the LOWER time frames to drive prices upwards etc I wish you all the best and as much success as I've had from this Indicator over the years - "and they tell you, you can't trade successfully with Indicators lol"

Hello Colleagues! Work topic. I'll put in my 2 cents. In the book by A. Almazov "Fractal Theory. How to Change Your View of the Markets" an example of trading with the MA channel is described. There are differences from the Islandfx911 channel: MA Period: 8, method: Linear Weighted. I decided to check how effective trading with one channel is, without using other indicators. The testing options were different, but I'll take the option from Islandfx911 : returning the price to the channel. Channel MA8, SMA. The first additional filter will be the channel width: for XU m5 I took the minimum channel from 250 pips. Second filter: Opening of a candle in the channel at the channel border. The report shows that the MA channel without indicators can be profitable. Good luck! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks for posting, Genry. Could you clarify this: "The first additional filter will be the channel width: for XU m5 I took the minimum channel from 250 pips." Thanks

P.S. Sometimes I use methods that are worthy of condemnation: I do not use SL and I average early entries. I do not recommend going this way if you do not fully understand the risk to the deposit. The same chart, but with averaging.

This is an enthusiastic thread. Thanks Rob and crew for all your interesting, informative posts. Rob, I'm in Oz too so am keen to follow your system in my waking hours. Your demeanor reminds me of the great Eelfranz from Trading made simple thread many years ago, who like you was a generous, straightforward fellow. Trying this out next week on M15 as prescribed. I see some false signals on the indy, but when i look closer it's often a poor unconvincing bar/candle signal, (e.g i'll look for an engulfing candle with trend) so due diligence and a glance at market structure and where you are on the chart will be helpful.

Sleepy Market... So here is my Tradingview Setup using DTosc Entries. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #543 ---
hello, was reading this thread and added the indicator. is it giving entry signals only around market opens? because sometimes it doesn't give a signal while price closes inside sma channel and momentum also aligns the trend.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
there is a HTF filter activated by default. You might not get a Signal because of it. the DTosc also needs to be OB/OS with the cross + Valid EMA/Candle "Pattern" to show a Signal

--- 帖子 #545 ---
So it gives signal when htf is aligned with ltf which just switched direction from ob/os?

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Its using the HTF last Signal as direction for the current Signal. I suggest reading through the Scripts manual thats directly on the link you have clicked to put the Script on the Chart. You ever built a Ikea cabinet without looking at the manual? Its pretty damn difficult.

Trying what I'm calling the second chance. Waiting/taking the second signal of the day in the same direction. If that makes any sense. It could be divergence, but it its not a necessity. One hour TF for me, and using 14,8,8,3 on DT.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
great track record! what i see is that you have long periods of 100 trades not moving much the account and more or less break even. do i observe this correct? and how do you handle these periods in kind of discipline? and thx for showing your track record!

Trying this pair. Second chance, but DT is not in bear mode.

Haha that is sure what it sometimes feel like! Married with 2 kids here, still primary school but boy oh boy, it seems like when we leave the store they have already outgrown the shoes/clothes we just bought! Anyway, back on topic. I just added the S/R script to tv as well (the link that COG posted), that gives it even more potential to optimize R/R. For my data collection I am using this strategy with a fixed 1.5R, and then logging how many more pips/R/R was on the table. With these levels on the chart it makes that a lot easier.

Write the Pair in the instrument Value. Place a "1" in the Alarm Value. Then you will get a box on the screen with trades. Place a "1" in the Notification Value, then you get the alarm on your phone if you have the mobile MT4 installed. Note that only some alarms should be traded, I am sure that you ubderstand that. Your normal analyzing is important. Using the MTF filter you will only get signals where the DTosc has the same direction in the two next upper timeframes. The next version I am working on has a OBOS filter, so that you can set it to only make alrms when the instument is overbought or oversold.

Ahh - sorry, I have chosen to use the EA coding, because it gives me loads of possibilities. I will not be working on the indicator also. I can see your problem, as you have a trading robot, then you cannot have my robot on the screen also. Sorry bout that. One solution can be to have 2 templates. Have my robot on the charts, and whenever you want to trade, then load the trading template with your trading robot. I do that sometimes. It is not that disturbing.

Excellent early call. When i matched with my chart i see your DTO settings are different and you have 2 running ...please can you advise the reasoning for 2 and when you adjust the settings according to time frames. Maybe ive missed it somwhere and you can refer me to a post. thanks

Looking at Nasdaq -London session. You can often pick up your daily bread by trading it prior to NY open. 15 and 5 minute direction, with a heavier bias towards 5 min - so far. Support lines, very important to me, are drawn prior to open as part of morning preparation.

Actually, my favourite timeframe is 2 minute. Less points in ES obviously, but similar money if you compare ES with 5 MNQ.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
I''ve been doing some futures trading too NQ and ES but only just get into this thread and the indicator. Am using Cognitive Alpha's indicator in Tradingview. The indicator itself reminds me of the Laguerre RSI.

New version of my signalrobot. New function is an overbought oversold filter. See the functionality in post #377 I add the MQ4 code this time. I use a "1" for on and a "0" for off. Will go back to bool algebra in next version.

I've traded index futures for about 10 years: First FDAX, then YM, and now NQ only. On 2m I don't primarily use StochRSI(14, 14, 3, 3) for signals, but to keep me out of trouble. Don't trade against it is the rule.

Hi, is it possible you can post your entries for NQ , based on your strategy, for today. Tks a lot

Today I just scalped off the 2m for half an hour and was done. So not according to any formal strategy. And instead of posting my entries, why don't you tell me what you'd like to know?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
thank you for this significantly improved version, especially that you can see the signal arrow at the bottom of the indicator and not in the chart. but it's a pity that i can't backtest it because no history is possible. or have i set something wrong?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
and again when i switch from timeframes m1 or m5 to m15, the old signals from the smaller TF dont disappear. would it be better to programm just an indicator instead of an expert because its more handy? but what do I know...

Hello Bird As it is not a trading robot, you cannot backtest it. An indicator would have historic data. That is right. An EA does not. Then again, I can assure you, that the DTOsc would lose big in a back test. Because the DTOsc is full of fake signals. Even with the filters I have made allready. And when people are showing their trades here on FF, you notice that they use a lot of other tools to select trades. They even use plain experience. And they only take some few trades out of many signals. Only because they are skilled traders, they can select the right signals to trade. I could easily make this into a trading robot. But it is not worth it. It is a good tool, but it cannot stand alone.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
No, you are right, signals does not disappear in a robot. Personally I like that.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I took a random pair. GBPCAD. Here are the trades for today. I have marked with arrows the trading signals, if trader just follow the crosses blindly. Note I only marked crosses beyond OB and OS. Out of 8 signals, there are 2 winners - depending of your TP strategy. Winrate 1:4. On chart number 2 you have the arrows that survive the filter of next higher TF. On chart number 3 only 1 signal survived the next HTF again. Timeframes are 15, 30 and 60. So we see, that 6 fake signals disappeared. Unfortunately the best winner also disappeared. But the last signal standing, is a nice one if you see it on M15 - the number 4 chart. Hmmm. I find this a surpricingly nice result done by the filters. Of cause this is just one single case, nothing that can be called a statistic.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi Birdland, Whether the following suffices i don;'t know but i reckon it is better than nothing, from a backtest pov. In the attachment you can see the EA running in the tester in visual mode. As you can see there are arrows on the screen and they stay there after the backtest has been made. No, the chart is not live but then again, one is doing a historic analysis, correct? ;-) Hope this will help somewhat.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Forex-nl is a very clever guy. And he and I is looking into maybe make this tool even better. Reults that might come will be posted here.

HI RF, When i skipped the OB-OS filter and used the MTF Filter (with and without H1 open-direction) i got the following charts. As you can see the initial entries were even supported by add-ons. Maybe less is indeed more and this is even closer to the original suggestion of Island. First chart is the MTF + H1 filter, 2nd one the MTF only filter

--- 帖子 #648 ---
GCAD.. just using 1Hr filter nothing else. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #649 ---
HI Cog, The filter i was referring to was the following: only long if the price is above open of the H1 bar and short if price is below the H1 open (or reg/green H1 bar) So, nothing to do with a signal being 'active' on a higher TF. It's just a different definition, i suppose, of the use of a higher TF ;-)

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Hi RF, Have you thought about a trading time filter? I only trade the market opens for 1.5hrs when trading activity is high. The market is pretty dead after that and false signals can occur. Regards Rob

i think just trade it like no indicator at key levels. we still need those sr key levels and just add the indicator in. ultimately it is the key level that steals the show, not the indicator. or the other way round, when indicator shows set up, check that there is key level to support the trade.

I had fallen into following the indicator routine as my wife has been a back seat driver this week and placing some trades. I can see how detrimental this still is and without those key levels / structures to trade away from you are in trouble. Cheers, have a good day all.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Very impressing. I agree. It will be a problem on a more flat day I am afraid. Let us test it further.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Yes, that is part of your strategy and thereby our strategy. But this is not a trading robot. You can turn it on when you want to trade. Then go make coffee and read the paper, you get a signal on your phone when there is a trade. Then, when you don't want to trade anymore, close the charts or the robot. We maybe should make an on/off button for phone signals right on the screen.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
This is also about helping your wife in the future. I am 70 myself and am thinking on my wife too. So I suggest a triple EMA band. Colours as in the traffic light to make it easy. It very easy shows if the daily is trendin g . Then the structure has a higher chance to be ok to trade at M15. And surely if the MA´s are cluttered on HTF, there can be no trading. I normally use EMA 20, 50 and 100. Then I as preparation for the day find the instruments that are trending the most on HTF and put the signal robot on those. Of cause a triple EMA band at the same chart as the EMA5 band will be way to much. Just make a template with these bands. It is so easy to change a template. In my case I have a profile that I consult before start of trading day. That is for the main analysis and selection of instruments to trade. And then I go to a trading profile to make the trading.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
I have the robot on 30 instruments. All filters are on. There have been signal on 4 of them this morning. 2 things: 1) In all 4 signals the trades suggested have been against the triple ribbon and it was easy to see, that those trades should not be taken. Luckily this is not an automatic trading robot, but only suggested signals. 2) In all 4 instruments there were no arrow at the next break down. This because the H1 DTOsc was showing the other direction. So maybe this filter is a little too much? Time will show. You will see, that I have not the EMA5 band on the chart. That is because the signal robot only gives signal, if the bar is closing inside that band, so I do not need to see it.

The simple and honest answer is that it was all intuitive, and the more complex answer would be along the lines of "order flow" etc.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
yes, it's clear that you don't take every signal. it should only serve as visual support. here is a simple 2ma cross indicator. i can backtest m1 visually and then i switch to H1 or M15 and look at the signals there. unfortunately i can't do anything with the expert. but i will ask in another thread if someone can program the signals as an indicator for mt4. i am a pragmatist.

As an oldie tech ignorant trader I would love to know if I could set a phone alarm to alert me when a level is broken. My poodle thinks I sit in the office for the sole purpose of throwing a brightly coloured ball down the hall way which means I often take my eye off the charts ( had a late trade today, for example.) Any on trading View? I am also looking at Ninja Trader Web - I cannot use Desk Ninja because I use an iMac and hate the add on etc for windows. Just a thought chaps -otherwise it is back to eyeballing the charts at pre drawn levels ( I only trade for two hours or so) and throwing a ball about for the dog. She has just pushed the ball under the desk. Bye for now.

Yes that is possible. You would have to input the level that should give the alarm. Is that what you want?

Good morning friends! Been a few days since I checked the thread, busy with work and kids. Will try to post an update of my trades this week. Monday was great with a +3R start in the morning. The rest of the week was not great, apart from a few nice shorts on BTC using this method. Looking back, my first impression: pretty choppy this week, ranging with some breakouts. But also I need to be fair to myself and acknowledge that some of the trades could have been easily skipped this week if I had the proper time. Hence, another note to self: don't trade when I don't have enough time.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
I have now tested the signals with DTosc with a small account, exclusively GU trades. I have taken many M15 signals, but also M5 signals. 60 tades or 4,6 trades/day the results aren't great, but there is room for improvement. here are the results after 13 trading days:

I was making an Alarm indicator ( This is an Indicator!!!) to support a strategy I work on. It tells if a specific moving average is broken. I use it for finding the bounces that are tradeable. When I was in it, i thought I could just as well let it print alarm and send IPhone messages when a level is broken. Turnips poodle want that, but its master does not use MT4, so this is a shame for him ;-) If you want to see where I needed the alarm function, it is here at post 593 to 596. Finding the trend | Page 15 | Forex Factory I have not tested the Level Alarm function, so don't trust it until you see it is working. And please let me know if it is not working.

Not sure whether is has been noticed yet but the SMA-HL channel equals the ssl-channel, with one small difference which pertains to the cross of the the lines. In essence they are the same so i do not feel too 'out of order' to bring this to the forefront. The mention of the TP on your remaining 50% actually triggered me. Looking at the ssl it seems that it can bring in many more pips (from time to time) than one could take using a fixed TP. Do you know at this point this is not the start of a 500p run on that position? If not, why not let the market decide? (and yes, for the informed amongst us, i have indee read the PipEasy thread, twice, and judging by some of the statements/ observations made, i'm not the only one ;-) ). Please note this is just a question, maybe i'v been reading too much lately and my brain is fried ..

i took a close and detailed look at my trades of the last 13 days and subjected them to a simple trend filter of 5 different MAs. I realized once again that my losses tended to be due to the fact that I traded against the trend of these 5 MAs. on the other hand, most of the gains were all in line with the trend. very simple, as it says in the textbook;-) i will pay much more attention to this in the near future. the DTosc indicator is not so important. also, the signal does not have to be 100% within the 5ma channel. the generally dominant trend at the moment has priority.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
this is what to look for and then you can take the signals of DTosc with more authority and safety

--- 帖子 #714 ---
more

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Thanks for posting the details. The old saying still stands strong. The trend is your friend I will be heading back over to my other thread on Monday and start posting there. I have had an overload of information this week and fried my brain. I have been trading the DTosc with mixed results, probably the same as Birdland. What I have got from trading it is that the close inside band rule with the trend is an excellent entry trigger. I will be looking at entering trades when DTosc is overbought / oversold off support and resistance with a close inside the band. I will post any trades I take with these parameters here. I see potential for an EA using these entry conditions Regards Rob

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Note that: My MT4 gives signals only when close has been inside the 5MA band. Signalrobot contains a Overbought/Oversold filter. And an mtf filter. I furthermore use the traffic light, which is the EMA's 20, 50 and 100 to show the trend and trades should only be taken when there is a bounce from one of the MA's. Because the DTosc has a myriad of wrong signals. Using these filters you will have very few but better signals. Then it is a nice thing that the robot has alarms, so that you can do other things while trading.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
On which tf do you take your entry?

--- 帖子 #718 ---
m15 generally, and sometimes m5

--- 帖子 #721 ---
i take the indicator and the signals less and less important. for me it is more important whether the price closes within 5MA, so price action. and then i also check whether the indicator is overbought/oversold.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Hi Birdland, The 5 SMA close inside the band is part of a trading system I was taught many years ago by a highly successful trader. It will give you the best low risk, value for money entry. Everyone looking at this thread should see that now. I am posting some rules and notes that I trade by. My rules to trade by. 1. The close inside the bands, either bullish or bearish will give you the best entry to a trade and is the only way you should enter a trade. 2. Always trade away from a support or resistance structure 3. Only place trade at or during the market opens. 4. Only trade one timeframe until you have mastered it, then you can introduce more. 5. Take profit at line chart support or resistance and or Pivot within the average daily range 6. TP always at 7.5R or as close to possible depending on above rule. 7. Do not move SL until 3R profit can safely be locked in. 8. Never move TP past 7.5R unless the only support and resistance, Pivot is further away from TP and is still within the average daily range. Notes: Never enter a bullish trade on a bullish candle (You will be paying retail price) Never enter a bearish trade on a bearish candle. (If you do this you will never make it) Your average risk return has to be higher than 3.0R (I will explain this later) Trading with emotions will affect your decision making. You must trade like a robot. Remember, No One Knows What Direction The Market Will Go At Any Given Point In Time. I will give you an example of how a belief about market direction can affect your trading. Post 688. What did EM say in the post? Did you have a bullish or bearish belief when you read it? You, I and everyone else must trade and follow their system without interference from others. When we place a trade it must be placed without emotion and as per our trading plans. Remove the distraction stay focused and accept the outcome. These are my rules / beliefs and must not be considered as the only way to trade. I wish everyone a profitable week ahead. Regards Rob

"Trading with emotions will affect your decision making. You must trade like a robot." I like trading sp500 albeit some here feel the Nasdaq gives more bang for the buck. However, what you have written ( Highlighted in black) is a crucial element to success and one that many demo traders will not realise until they put cash on the line ( skin in the game.) The change in mind set from demo to real can be a shock: Your finger starts a life of its' own whilst grabbing little profits or frozen in the air as your losses go past your calculated stop loss in the hope that price will come back ( some times it does but the one time it doesn't is where fear matches your empty pocket.) Fantastic thread you have here as is your other thread.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
if traders are interested more into MA-channels, i really can recommend (like turnip15 already has done) to read the threads from LauraT and her 8EMA system. she is also a brilliant teacher and trader.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
that would take a thousand hours of chartist experience to build confidence to take that trade entry candle. there is the 'signal' candle and then the '2b' pattern since you use the 5SMA High-Low channel, a simple name for that setup would help many to see that as a '2b pattern'. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #727 ---
To the contrary I'd say the only thing that works is discretion unaffected by personal psychology . This is because emotions are essential for decision making. And I am saying that against a background from [old skool physical space] prop firms, where invariably everyone who, with the arrival of decent online trading platforms, tried to work for themselves from home failed due to their personal psychology. They needed a manager looking over the shoulder to keep discipline. This means that personal psychology was the problem, not their approach to trading. Still, of course, some (but not most) may be able to force themselves to comply with the robotic mantra, Yet for these, formerly very successful traders, that didn't work. And chances are it won't work for you either. Yet, statements such as the one you highlighted are taught as common wisdom, while being far from the full truth. To me it reads like a slogan from Alcoholics Anonymous - the kind of things you have to force to believe yourself in order to overcome your addiction. And the addiction is to unconsciously rooted impulsive actions. Which can be worked on, and which those few who are fortunate to find a good mentor will be able to do. For those who lose consistently, that's much better than throwing money away at fighting ghosts one can't see or understand, trying to convert themselves into the robots they will never be. Here's how a stunningly successful hedge fund trader explains his success: Then there's the story of the legendary Larry Williams who couldn't find success trading based on technical analysis, and became successful only when he integrated contextual market understanding into his approach. And such contextual understanding is what I call discretion.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Larry Williams is a renowned trader known for his analytical prowess and use of historical data to achieve success in the financial markets. He has developed several influential trading indicators and strategies, such as the Williams %R indicator, which measures overbought and oversold levels to identify potential reversals in asset prices. Williams' approaches often combines both technical and fundamental analysis, allowing him to make informed decisions based on market trends and patterns. His meticulous study of market dynamics and historical data has enabled him to create effective trading strategies that have stood the test of time. Throughout his career, Williams has authored numerous books and conducted workshops to share his knowledge and insights with other traders. His contributions to the trading community have made him a respected figure and a source of inspiration for many aspiring traders. Thanks A.I. my turn. That's true up to a point but, I met the man many years ago, and from his presentation I recall his enthusiasm and passion showing us the reams of price data research on how he developed strategies such as Smash Day. For me, it would be that he traded on what the charts were showing him, but as you say, he was aware of the market bigger picture. Don't forget his generation traded indexes and softs, such as corn and soybeans; he would demonstrate the effect of seasonals on those, which do not always translate to Forex, especially just for day traders. My 2 cents, have a great week.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
I hear you. Larry Williams is a polarizing figure in the trading world. While some traders swear by his methods and have found success using his strategies, others have had experiences like yours and feel differently. It's important to remember that trading is highly individual, and what works for one person might not work for another. Your skepticism is valid, and it's always wise to critically evaluate any trading system or advice before committing to it. And we all want to get lucky.

You are right about the entry on the chart I posted, that is my error. I am not sure what happened there with arrow placement. I can assure you though I enter bullish trades on bearish rejection candles. My SL size starts at 2 pips for AU and goes as high as 15 for GJ. I don't think it takes balls to enter when price is coming straight at you it takes experience and hours of watching the market. I am pretty much housebound now and get to sit at my trading screens for 10hrs a day if I want so I have had plenty of time to work out the benefits of entering trades like this. Do they fail yes, but I am not bothered because i can have multiple loses and a couple of wins each week and I will be in front far greater than the trader that is stuck in the 2R profit mindset. (Not directed at anyone) I just have different beliefs about trading. I will like to add that I run 3 different systems that have 3 different types of entry. The rejection candle entry is my primary entry method.

I know indicators-based traders love to have filters to pick better trades. But before we start with more filters in the chart' sub-windows, we should use the filters already build-in the StochRSI window. We should learn and master the use of the StochRSI and observe how this oscillator behaves in different market types conditions. There is no short-cut here. By putting an indicator on your chart does not mean you know how to use it correctly and make money. You have to spend the time ... read, study and learn. This entire process takes time. The more hours you spend trading in real-time live market conditions will help you become better traders. USDCAD Mar06 Tokyo 8am I have my filters on my charts. Keep my charts simple and clutter free. Follow simple rules for entries and exits. Attached Image (click to enlarge) ...

--- 帖子 #778 ---
There is where the fun starts. The potential (d)evolution and “indicatorisation” of a system. No one way to trade profitably and if the indicators help the trader make money, then go for it. Having been there, for me they don’t help and become a crutch leading to analysis paralysis. Once entry is dictated by entry criteria manage the trade.

Each of us here on FF have our own way of trading and seeing things. We are all at different stages of our trading journey. Nobody is right or wrong. We don't personally know each other and we don't really know how much experience as traders each of us has yet we are soon to dismiss each others views in a heartbeat. I have always had the view of listen to what others say (post) if you find it helpful let them know as others will benefit from it. If you don't agree move on and do your own thing. In my early days I asked Em for help because I had truly hit the wall, I could see the money yet I could not get to it. The next day I realized that only I could make trading work. It takes hard work to trade consistently. Lets all work together and make this viable for all. You are doing a great job and I look forward to seeing your posts this week. I still don't agree with everything he posts but I move on a do my own thing.

I have tried to pay more attention to retrace bounces off the 200 sma and also rejection candles off ADR high and low - with some above average results. Doing blind normal retracement entries without further confluence than the indicator has not been profitable the last few days. I think that a good approach will be to find quality entries that has several confluences and match them up with a good risk to reward - and then we will be much better off. Entries off the 100 sma and sometimes the 50 sma can also do the job, but the larger the sma - the more power the trade has in my eyes. We can build on with pivot levels - volume candles and so on - the more confluences we can get together the better. How much importance do you place to the above in your trades?
