Hi, thank you for sharing but can you post the mq4 file otherwise no one can improve the code and since you are beginner I think there will be alot of bugs.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Question: how do you use the auto tp, ts, sl ea in combination with the eurusd and usdjpy EA's?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for your response, I would love to do this but in organized way because unfortunately i can't post the mq4 in public, So any developer need to involved in the developing the above EA just PM me i will send the mq4 as private and i will update #1 post with list of the developer names. and will keep the ex4 updated in this thread.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi,

Just attach the ronz_auto_sl-ts-tp in new chart.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
hey alawy 103 thanks for the EA

any testing results of this EA that you can share?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi blamshakk,

Thanks for you and will wait your results ..

A little confused, here. You said the template had the indies, but I don't see them on the chart and the properties dialogue doesn't show them, either. Do they have to be loaded separately?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Keep it up

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi ChicagoRob,

just make sure that you copy all the files, the template had the indicators.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #22 ---

Hi ChicagoRob,

Thanks

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Already done. Looking forward to some green pips.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I just get alerts but ea does not open positions

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi forexpairs,

Check the EA settings and remove the (m) because it look like your broker not having suffix.

thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I am using oanda, m is only in the EURUSD and USDJPY EA not the ronz_auto EA

--- 帖子 #31 ---
alawy103,

Absent the mq4 files and notes, can you briefly explain your entry and exit logic ?

PVSRA trading & scalping EA's have been attempted through the years with no success just curious to see if you are on to something positive....nothing is impossible....

Hoping all works well  as MM's are sneaky and love to catch wrong way traders with their fast retraces.

Thanks,
Cigarguy

--- 帖子 #32 ---
alawy103,

Quick little FIFO UJ M1 scalp maybe some help......only one trade draws no conclusion but it's a start.......

Sneaky MM's love to run stops as they do with they do best.....

I would not have opened a trade that close to the opening of the new hours candle expecting a possible PA run or retrace but EA logic cannot know that and not being negative but observing the positive possibilities and hoping you have a great tool here.

Stay GREEN My Friend

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Can someone explain why the loss is 20 times greater than the trade that hit TP when, according to the inputs, the SL should be half the TP?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Great job Alawy, was waiting for a long time for someone to assemble great trading strategy of Cigarguy to the ea.

I have a few questions:

1. can you describe functions in a ea settings, and on which TF is optimum to place ea

2. independent ea for money/order management ...is it really necessary, wouldn't it be in a conflict with trading eas sl and tp

3. can ea be used for other pairs.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
help with my problem, ea does not open positions ????

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I have the same problem

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Your AutoTrading is turned off. EAs need AutoTrading turned on in order to work!

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Nice results so far.....

--- 帖子 #39 ---
can you show your settings are they the same as the ones I posted?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
You must have the luck of the Irish. I have two $4 winners and a $89 loss. Go figure.

Since you seem to be in the groove, you might want to increase your TP.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
no trades so far, are these settings correct?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
My results so far:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Most of the trades were closed with 0.5 pips or 1 at best i am not sure why since i used a default, may be trailing stop.

I am guessing that there is some interference between ron and ea money management.

What are these options and how they work?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
It's a pity ... perhaps a good EA for a great reliable system ... but without the code/mq4 all discussion so far does remember reading tea leaves ...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi Cigarguy,

Thank you for your contribution to this topic, as you mentioned this the start and without the teamwork no body will get any success, in regards to the absent of the mq4 files, As you know the FF is public and anyone can take the EA and sell it out the forum and I have truly mentioned in my previous post that I would love to do this but in organized way. Therefore, I like your explanation on the chart and it's very helpful to fix any bug related to the EA as i will listed down for the next version, so let us think logically in your attached chart, What we have to done after the blue candle shell we close the order at any price or we tell the ea don't trade behind the new hour or open reserve order. bear in mind i have not made any exit logic in the EA.

Kind regards,

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi ChicagoRob,

this is default setting with the EA, You have to set the setting. as i have not mention TP or SL, it's all depends on you.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Lazar83,

kindly just let me know which setting you would like to get describe on it. For the order management, you can use the main two EA for just order entry and the 3rd for the order management unless you would like to add something that can help us, of course will love to hear that from any member here. Again the EA has been configured only to work with EURUSD and USDJPY pair.

thanks

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks for sharing  keep it up . kindly note that you are trading GBP and the EA in not configured to work with this pair.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi forexpairs,

Just remove the suffix (pro) from the setting, as your broker not having suffix and let us know.

thanks,

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi Lazar83,

Kindly share with us the screenshot for the order made the loss. it's on MQ4 folder as i mentioned on my first post. to let us talk on it. and for the option here the describe ...

Total profit close (The EA will close whole orders when your trading balance on profit such any amount ) for exp I need to close all order on 20 USD profit I just need to put 20.
Total loss close (The EA will close whole orders when your trading balance on loss such any amount ) for exp I need to close all order on -20 USD profit I just need to put 20.
Stoploss ( it's basic function to let the ea send order with loss pip )
Takeprofit  (it's basic function to let the ea send order with profit pip )
Price ( this is the default setting for the PVSRA setup. as for me not recommended to changed ) if you would like to get more info about this just refer to the main topic .

Thanks

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi DerBerliner,

Why you would like to have the original code if the Ea is working without any expiration date ?!! if you will say to see the entry setup just attach the Ea on your meta trader and do the test for each entry and share with us here any bugs in order to think how we can solved .

thanks

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Ok this is perfect, adding a trailing stop will eliminate the need for ron ea. With this explain everything we need for trading is there(ok trailling stop is not there ...yet ).

One thing i like here is lots of opportunities for trading, casino style...not as gambling style.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi Lazar83,

Just use the third EA (ronz_auto_sl-ts-tp) for the trailing stop. This EA having different different trailing stop style and share with us your results.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #53 ---
did that still does not open any positions

also suffix is not in the ronz_auto

--- 帖子 #64 ---
You have to use it with MT4!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I'm real sorry i'm new to MT, I go to meta trader website and downloaded their MT4 platform it turn out to be MT5 is there anyway to change it to MT4? or anywhere to download MT4?. Much appreciated

All who's having issue with opening any position, just make sure the broker spreed is not higher than the setting in the EA.

Only EUR USD .. is working !!! .. strangeness is not opening positions in the USD JPY pair .. I did not find out the reason !!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Romax,

try to keep high number in spread field of the EA, if it's work means your broker spread is higher than your current setting. and make sure also you set different magic number in both.

thanks.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
673 downloads and only one or two sharing the results ?!!!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Wait till you hit your first stop loss.

any number can be used in the field.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thanks, we will wait your results.

2 people made a huge loss 20times the profit made, please address the issue.

@ Alawy

IS logic of the ea like this

Currency strength Eurusd ( EUR 2.1 , USD 4.1) Sell

CAN SIGNAL Monthly  red , weekly re, daily red  H4 re, h1 red, m30 red m15 red , m5 red , m1 re / signal sell

Price is below Dragon / Sell

Price between rounded numbers/ sell

Volume indicator signal / red /sell

Example for sell. Please correct me if i am wrong

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Where is the screenshots !! how we can solve the issue without see the chart ? !

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Currency strength Eurusd ( EUR 2.1 , USD 4.1) Sell ""( not correct) -----when USD higher than EUR ""

CAN SIGNAL Monthly red , weekly re, daily red H4 re, h1 red, m30 red m15 red , m5 red , m1 re / signal sell ""The EA looking only for 5 15 30M and 1 hour""

Price is below Dragon / Sell "yes"

Price between rounded numbers/ sell ""when broke the round number to down""

Volume indicator signal / red /sell ""yes""

Please refer to cigarguy thread

--- 帖子 #100 ---
"Currency strength Eurusd ( EUR 2.1 , USD 4.1) Sell ""( not correct) -----The EA observe the currency move """

So EUR moves down from 2.3 to 2.1 and USd goes up from 3.9 to 4.1 , or this is irrelevant for ea?
CAN SIGNAL Monthly red , weekly re, daily red H4 re, h1 red, m30 red m15 red , m5 red , m1 re / signal sell ""The EA looking only for 5 15 30M and 1 hour""

I know that we are scalping for few pips but in last two years i have added time filter in almost every ea with very good results . Basically ea never trades against monthly weekly, daily h4 h1 etccc. Can you add option in ea ( call it experimental xxxx) where we can choose which higher time frame to add for checking direction.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
what do you means by time filter ??

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi alawy103

can you explain THIS
NOTE: The EA take screenshots for the chart in each and every entry on (MQL4\Files\Shots) so attach the template with the EA to let the EA take shots with PVSRA setup.

what you mean , attach templates with the EA,

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Simple in ea properties add option:

Trade in direction of a M, W, D1,H4,H1,M30,M15, M5 / by this we can choose which higher TF ea will look before entering into a trade.

I am fully aware that this is pure scalping and that there is no need to go in such bigger TF , but it would be good to test it. (simple creating one mod of the ea, which will not be relevant for this thread until tested )

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Got it, based on my test the best candles are 5M 15M 30M 1H

I will do more testing when the market open.

Thanks Lazar83

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Means any order opened by EA. The EA take screenshots for the chart for review it in case made loss. so i make note to use the template for PVSRA setup and run the EA.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
usdjpy is opening orders now but ronz_auto is not and im not sure why

how do you change the lot size for ronz_auto that might be the issue

thats how i got the usdjpy to work, eurusd has not opened any positions yet.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Alawy ,

Thanks for making such a great tool in your hard time ,

I have started testing it from this week , but since I saw in the code that we can make it fully automated without having any template or indicator I mean all codes i will implement in just single ex4 , all indicators as well as templates which the code uses.

Also there are some more options if we will add on it then peoples will not have issues.

If you are interested kindly share the code with me in PM and once I finish I will send you the same version.

Anyway thanks for your cooperation .

--- 帖子 #108 ---
nice one boss

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I put your ea at default settings, as it was recommended and reportedly working for some people, on my VPS and let it run a bit. What I've seen is that it's completely unusable at default settings, it closes orders at 1pip or so profit and lets losers run until it hits the 25pip sl set by the ronz ea. Obviously one should edit the settings to ones liking, I just don't understand why people claiming default settings would work.

Now I'm trying to configure the ronz ea to have for testing purposes:

Overall TP of all individual opened trades of 50pips

Overall SL of all individual opened trades of 5pips

After 5pip profit, lock in BE+1

After 10.1pip profit, start trailing 5.1pips

Setting 0 to all SL and TP values in your ea should let ronz ea control those settings completely, right?

Looking forward to test this more, the first 2 trades it took were actually pretty good if they hadn't been closed too early...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
nice setup but if you refer to the main cigar thread d, tp 5 while sl is 10pips

--- 帖子 #111 ---

Hi Alawy103 and others (with a respectable technical level of MT4 knowledge )

Great kickstart here with an amazing EA man. Compliments !

Will post my progression here. And will post 'only' screenshots of losing trades that are feesable to analyze contrary your EA logic.

ECN Broker: Pepperstone

Account type: Demo / Razor

Leverage: 400:1

Still fine tuning SL and Start_Time / Finish_Time but running it 35 Hours gives bellow result so far and it looks very promising. It is to early to judge but looking forward to see how it will behave in higher volatility days.

Hi Alaywy,

If there is a pending order for EU, i will assume that the EA won't be able to create the new order right?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
hi Alawy103

please check my screenshot, both USDJPY and EURUSD is less than 20pips (5 digit broker) spread on my broker BUT I used 40 on my EA and I also adjusted the lot plus the suffix of (m)..

NO TRADE YET BY EA FOR LIKE 5hours NOW.

help !!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
do i really need to remove "m" ?

my broker has m as suffix, so i dont think i have to remove it.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Sorry i didn't see that, you are correct  Is there any message can you see on "Journal" Tab

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Based on the fact that we don't know what you configured before setting up this strategy i would do:

- Check all DLL permissions needed on Indy's and EA's and in MT4 itself (Ctrl+O)

- Clear any existing Global variables (shortcut F3)

- Restart

- Read the thread and see that almost everyone is using M5 timeframe and not M1.... (EA structure unknown so black box to say that it is a problem) this just to be in line with average testers here.

From that point issues are better to pin point.

And when that is not working because you are having/had more dll issues. Do a clean install of MT4 and setup only this strategy and start with default parameters even when they are not correct yet.

Hi alaway103, first, thank you for the EA you created. Started today forward testing EU and UJ . EU is up 1,69% but UJ is currently in deep loss, waiting for UJ up trend. I did not attached the Ronz Auto SL TP manager jet as some settings are not quite clear.

Here are my first day trades.

Great EURUSD trades but an alarming USDJPY trade.

Can you check your spread for USDJPY and EURUSD?

View -> Strategy Tester

Under Symbol, select Symbol properties

If it is > 13, then modify the spread in the EA

I noticed that the spread is at 30-40 for most of the pairs today... not too sure if you guys are seeing that as well.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Pepperstone Razor: EURUSD 0.2 / USDJPY 0.3 average spread

I dont know why you use strategy tester information for that. This EA is only good for forward testing.

Look top left on chart for actual spread info.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Woow, 0.3?

Real razor I must say.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
anyone have  a good set file

also ronz_auto still no trades eurusd and usdjpy works

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Ronz_auto is not an trading ea. Is just to manage trades

--- 帖子 #150 ---
why did OP include it in the expert list then?

Expert list

1) ronz_auto_sl-ts-tp // To set your target or trailing stop

2) FIFO AlAwy103 (USDJPY) // Use only with USDJPY

3) FIFO AlAwy103 (EURUSD) // Use only with EURUSD

so this ea is only for usdjpy and eurusd according to you?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
It also an EA for manage SL and TP in stealth mode, you can attach that on another chart, if you want use stealth SL and TP which not visible to broker.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
MaxOrders seems not working. By default = 1 but EA did 5 trades

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I have got some trades with default settings, Looks like without fixing EA can't go on real.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
combining ea into one as you suggested in a great idea

would help everyone and can have one set file

Terrible losses

--- 帖子 #157 ---
So far 75% of 40 trades are wins. Adjusting SL and TP to get ultimate RR.

Big loss doesn't mean that the EA is bad. In fact it looks great so far but bank holidays and only two days of testing gives not a clear picture.

Happy testing

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Which settings are you using?  Do you add both EAs at once for them to work?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
can you share your set file and which ea are you using just the eurusd and usdjpy ones or ronz_auto as well?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
@Alawy

i have tested ea on real account  and on  some pairs i thought it would be interesting. I know that you are working only on 2 pairs but i have been using similar systems for scalping (without volume component) with success. I am afraid of trading on eurusd and usdjpy at same time since they are heavily correlated. So far ea is working good without bugs and in profit. Thank you for you coding effort.

Default settings/ only spread optimized

Optimizing Ron ea would be next step in right direction

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Just testing friends.. With 75% wins the Total Profit can win from the SL's (but will see that after a long test period)

[EDIT] will share set files in a later state. Crowd testing means all together / different settings.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Great !  using Ronz or not ?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
yes i am using ron default....ill need to optimize it, didnt have time. important thing is that ea doesnt have bugs so far.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I Agree. Yup needs tweaking. Maybe going to use another one.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
did ronz open any trades?

I have not gotten any trades on ronz so far

what are your settings?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Ronz manages open orders of multi pairs. It not trade....

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Dear All,

how does the start time end time work ? Which time does it follow ? Broker time or cpu time ?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Alawy,

Can look into this screenshot?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
what ea do you use then for pairs other than eurusd and usdjpy

like gbpusd and audusd

--- 帖子 #170 ---
EA is doing great, but i notice one weak point EA open trades on strong support and resistance points. if we can prevent that it will be great.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
For now its default settings, but you have to check spread on your broker, maybe thats a problem. or change a broker.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Try changing the spread to 50. Works for me. Also remember to include/change the suffix if your broker has.

Can anyone answer my question? How does the start and end time work? I am thinking of enabling the expert in london to us hours only.

please help.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
would you minding telling us which broker you are using for such setting?

put tp on ea between 10 point or more

and put your stop loss to 500 point

founding this virtual order

could any coder put it to ea?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Same alawy EA for other pairs but not suggested by alawy.

@Alawy can you be more specific why your EA is only for EU and UJ at this point ? Something to do with Volume average ? could be coded to handle that.

And in consolidation periods the EA is also trading. Are you not using the logic of strong trend up>1-2 o'clock and dn>4-5 o'clock. Would give less trades i agree but....

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I can but I need alawy to send me mq4

--- 帖子 #180 ---
This is my result for today.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thanks for sharing, I have listed down this issue as it mentioned by cigarguy. and still waiting suggestion to fix it .

Hi Johnhere

I suggest to focus in two pair only, but let me know which pair you would like to run the EA on it ? !

--- 帖子 #183 ---
this will be my third time raising this issue !!!

1000 pips sl and 2 pips tp is not reasonable, rob on cigarguy thread uses 10pips sl and 5pips tp quick scalp.

You dont wana be in a trade for 2wks bro.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Nice result, my result is similar. But what do you do when your opened trade is -80 EUR ?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I have uploaded this EA, without enough time of testing , so 1K downloaded this EA and few of members sharing their opinion. for time being I am observing the EA too and focusing in the entry logic only.

if nobody share loss screenshots , How we would be able to found the problems !!!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I have asked to share your screenshot to review the entry

Lots size isn't the problem.

Your Max trade should be 1.

Hi, my second demo acc, current status:

Forestzinc

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Use 50 for the spread.

Use 500 as SL, some brokers cannot accept 9999

Check your suffix.

And most importantly, wait and wait for trade.

If you adjust the EA without patient, you might need to wait afresh. Lol

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Alright! already applied I will need to see whether going to be automated anot. Thank you very much!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
after reset my pc

ea can't work

any help?

Set SL to 100 or 50 on Ronz EA ir will cut the loses quickly

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Update  3

--- 帖子 #212 ---
which tf you use?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Last 2 losses recovered.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Can we use the EA without indicators ? My VPS CPU usage is around 90% now

--- 帖子 #215 ---
whats important is to have the indicators in your mt4 indicator folder.

The EA uses iCustom call function, which mean the EA refers to the indicators for signals.

Here is my screen and CPU usage is less than 30%

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Alway103 needs screenshots of lossing trades in order to optimise the EA settings, removing the indicators will only capture naked chart.

By the way, I have 3 ideas to add to the mq4 codes for optimal results

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Update 4

Picture cant occupy the screen again!! hahaha

85% profit made today with optimized setting, still waiting for Alway103 for mq4

Closing for the day.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
@Alawy or others. Can you put order time and/or order number in the screenshot naming convention. That would make it easier for all to find, analyze and post.

And for your other question: For test i dont need more pairs, I only want to know what the restrictions are. To get more feeling in what we are doing you know.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I use 100 pip SL and 70pip TP on Ron EA, today it hits SL 2 times but overall I'm in profit side.

Hi. Very impressing results

Two questions :

- It looks like your SL is 15 and TP 10 when analyzing your trades, correct?

- Are you trading M5 or M15 charts?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Alot of losses

can someone share their set file?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Today i had a 76 open orders , 73 in tp and 3 closed in minus. I had put ea to 2 brokers and one LP account. On LP i had 76 open positions /73 profits/3 closed in minus. On 2 other ecn/stp brokers account i had between 25 and 41 open position,with lots of slippage from execution side and spread widening .

So if you can open at some Liquidity provider accounts since regular brokers did not behave good.

TP was 10 pips max spread 30 and sl was manual.

thanks but the ea is still not doing anything.....

do i copy the indicators to the expert advisor folder as well......

Hi adelzadeh,

I am not wasting  time on regular brokers ecn/stp, i have accounts on LP TopFx and Lmax. So for me only there i will continue testing.

Also demo will not give you even near picture of how effective this ea or any scalping ea is.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Yes, just share here your ideas for any improves.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I think indeed that it is all about Forex Broker Volume differences but.. again, black box if we cannot get any detailed info or just an in depth answer about it (even a little) from the logic of this nice EA. More specific some piece of the code (i still can't say it's true because i am blind because EA is not opensource (i can code)) there has to be a more versatile logic as compute volume/average(vol) in the code to overcome this. It looks there is some static value coding in it now. Just my two cents..
Screenshots will not say anything.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Ah I thought you wanted help with developments according to your post #4. I am a full time mq4 programmer so I can provide updates very quick if still needed.

10pips cannot be accepted by broker, because 10pips means 1pip for 5 digital brokers.

Use 100pips (which means 10real pips)

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I like the fact that the EA respect the strength meter and dragon but ea has to avoid trade close to solid sr zones line Round Numbers and half numbers.

If those zones were broken, then trade can be placed by EA.

As cigarguy said earlier, ea should avoid new hourly candle open.

yes i mean is same 10 pip=100 point
also stop level is 0 pip

Hi Alawy, this is a nice EA based on PSVRA. I've tested it today and It's giving a good result.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I set the ROnz EA too tight, some might be a good run if it's not for the BE.

Btw, about finding strong SR level, Quinton has the neat indicator for this: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=584705

I wonder if it can be used in your EA logic? It basically trying to find the high/low and how many touches it have on a specific levels. The more touches, the stronger it will be.

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
are you using eurusd and usdjpy ea on all the pairs and if so which ones do you use them for?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Could you please provide a set file of your settings. Are you using Ronz ea to manage or have just set the take profit and stop loss in the ea's ? If so could you please tell us what time frame you are getting those results on. i am still confused on what to put in the "total profit close" bos or do we just leave it at 3.9 and just adjust the "TAKE PROFIT AND STOP LOSS" under the order management section? Some help would be very appreciated thanks.

Nice results, I'm using 3 pips TP and 5 pips SL, do you use different SL TP values for each separate pairs ? can i know what is your SL and TP pips .

Thank You

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Tobben,  try setting the EA EURUSD similar to this. Configure your Total Profit exit and Total Loss exit, as well as SL and TP according to your preference.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
think he use higher time frame{mtf signal on m1}

because all of tp hit ed

higher time frame signal, have more power

--- 帖子 #282 ---
So far, result is bad. EA configuration is also attached. FYI.

Note that the TF used is M5

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I am using m1/m5 mixed, but ill have to clean charts since i dont know which order came from which tf since i cannot change comment.

tp is 10 pips and sl is manual sometimes 20 15 pips depends on PA

I am new to FF, just want to say thank you so I registed, you really did a great job!

After two days of testing to get some results.

1. Only work on some trading hour, can not trade for all day.

2. The SL and TP ratio are the difficult part, still testing on it.

3. Same setting has difference results on difference brokers, seems ecn is better.

You two are building something good which can be improved even further (better entry, exit logic, cosolidating multiple pairs into a dashboard, handle news events better, etc)Alot of systems die out due to not being optimized for the times, if we want to beat the market (also big banks) we have to work as a team

alawy103 - thank you for your work! Loads of testing to do but looks very promising already.

Just two things I would love to see if possible. One is a news filter, which is pretty self-explanatory.

The second is perhaps the possibility to limit the number of trades of the same kind in a period of time. For example "maximum 2 consecutive longs in 24 hours". This could help avoid situations like this:

What do you think?

Hi zazox ,

Thanks for sharing, the news filter already done in the next version, for the second idea i will listed down to think about it later.

HI，Alawy103 if you can consider adding a profitable option, such as I set the profit goal is 100 points, when the profit of more than 60 points, the market appears retracement, so keep a certain proportion of earnings in accordance with the highest profit point to it, the lowest profit preserved

I've had the EA running on my VPS for some time on a demo account now and the results are a bit wonky, but I can definitely see the potential of the EA once the entries have been finetuned and maybe having a more proactive exit strategy than simply letting it hit SL or TP. I've noticed that the EA would close a losing trade and open a new one in the same direction which also results in a loser, meaning there should be some kind of restriction to not let it open too many trades in the same direction successively. Also it was opening trades at clear S/R levels, which is something that needs to be addressed. It seems letting it run during the night was not a good thing to do, will have to see after a few days if it keeps losing more during low volume times.

These are the results so far from today, settings used are M5 5pip SL 10pip TP

Thank you sharing and for all your hard work alawy. I started using your EA on Tuesday, initially with the eurusd and the usdjpy. The results for Tuesday are based on a 5min chart, 10 pip sl and 5 pip tp. On Wednesday I changed the tp the 10 pips giving a 1:1 return and today I added the gbpusd and eurjpy. I am starting the EA at Frankfurt opening with the intention of closing when the UK markets close.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi folks, i tested the EA since Tuesday as well. (Tickmill Demo). Settings 10 pips TP, 15 SL. Here are my results: Overall a loss of 500 $ trading 1 lot each pair on a 10k demo. However , i made some analysis and saw that the losses occured mainly in a specific time frame (Asian session in the beginning) AND in specific pairs.

So actually  i will run the demo ongoing with trading starting at 02:00 London time and ending 16:00. btw what is the correct format in the time settings? 2, 2:00, or 02:00 ? Thanks.

Will post the results with the new settings. Any suggestions in term of SL and TP ?

Good trading to all of you ;-), of course especially alawy, thanks for sharing.

Did you switch to M1 on Wednesday also or you left it at M5? As I have much more trades on M1 than in your report.

Hi zazox, I used 5min on all three days, I haven't tried the 1minute

This system works very well, with low spreads

--- 帖子 #347 ---
anyone else think this system could benefit from a dashboard similar to babon scalping where you have all currency pairs on one screen and just one ea to run on all

I would really like to help develop something like that

see example

this system is more accurate so it would work better than babon but babon has better UI and UX.

Dashbord EAX would be better solution for this.

@Alawy

I am trying to keep lets say 10 pairs on M1 and 10 pairs on M5, all on the same platfrom.

Can i use lets say magic number 1111 for M1 charts( 10 pairs under one ea with same magic) and magic number 2222 for m5 pairs( 10 pairs under one ea with same magic number9). If i do like that would ea open trades without problem. For example at the same time on m1 eurusd and m5 eurusd, and also other pairs.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Can you please tell us a bit more about the new round number logic and the settings of it?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Looks promising but I reckon we need a kind of filter otherwise we will get lots of false entries., gonna give it a try from Frank open till London.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Sure, if the price is within 'x' number of pips under 1.06000, will not open order.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I just had the same issue as Kubiasty above (with the new version 1.6)

EUR USD short closed with 1 point (0.1 pip) profit. Please advise what is the issue here.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
This is not issue, as the expert observe the chart during the order open and when the market retrace the volume, the ea will close to the nearest profit. this is only in v1.6

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi there alawy

is this an updated version of the EA ?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
yes dear

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Very interesting and thank you for the answer.

But maybe we should be able to set this up or turn it off? At least to account for commission.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
yup, appreciate your hard work on this..........

--- 帖子 #360 ---
calculate commission and put pip up and pip dn to minimum pip

exp: if your commission is 5$ per lot, so you must pay 0.05$ per 0.01 lot{pay it with base currency, if you trade on gbpjpy and your base currency is usd ,you must pay 0.05gbp, for audusd must pay 0.05 aud and ...}

put pip up and pip dn to 0.6pip,if you want ea close your position with 0${without loss}

this exp be for usdjpy

for calculation go here: https://www.cashbackforex.com/en-US/...alculator.aspx

don't forget commission

--- 帖子 #362 ---
adelzadeh as I understood the settings of the round numbers only prevent the opening of new orders and should not affect the opened ones. Am I wrong and this is actually the setting for this "volume retrace" situation I had?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hi alawy,  from London open till close give some nice results but then London closes and market gets dry so its easier to  manipulate so we get lots of false entries,  would not be possible to reverse the entry criteria after London close?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #419 ---
hey guy's

think max spread not work correctly

because spread always start from 0 pip {TRUE ECN} and suddenly wide and ea take position on tight spread and close it on wide spread{it hapeen in few millisecound it more chance for loss trade}

think we must use last candle spread, not current candle

mean when last candle spread is higher x pip ea do not take position until last candle high spread be under x pip{mean next last candle always}{mt4 can't record spread history, we must use a spread recorder indicator for adding this option to ea}

i think it more safe

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi, I think your takeprofitclose (3,9) is to small when you use 1 lot? Try to set it to 500, Then the TP of 175 (17,5 pips) will be used.

So you must decide if you want to use the money management settings or if you want to use the TP/SL settings (order management).

--- 帖子 #520 ---
What broker are you using? Your spread looks low

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Can't show any broker's name on FF, PM you already.

Not a good day on Friday. Persevered with the 5min chart using 10pip sl & tp. Most pairs were choppy throughout the day and this had a bearing on the results

Hi guys so hows the EA doing? the new version i mean, the old im still testing, more time is needed, im analysing the data so it can be more helpfull.

So far it seems to me that for short term trades its best big pairs like E/U U/J G/U.

In the other pairs it works best in long term trades to maximize the profit but still have little data so im still working things out.

Im tryng my best to help.

Take the pips and run for the hills

--- 帖子 #575 ---
thank very much alawy103!! i will test when i get home. the EA does not work on my work computer, for some reason.

@alawy

One way to improve ea is to add higher time frame filters....for eample ea will not trade against D1 , or H4.  H1 and M15 M5 can change in a few seconds and that way ea can trigger trades against trend.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Can you place example !?

Ea gets signal for sell, so it will add check:

1. Conditions you have now incorporated in 1.6

2. Checks M W D1 candlle, H4 candlle H1, M30M15M5 (user needs to select in ea settings which candles direction will ea look as filter), and user selcted that his additional filter for opening trades are D1 H4 H1.

D1 H4 H1 are RED (candles on these 3 tf are going down, lower since opening), ea will execute sell order that way it doesnt trade against trend on higher tf

Ea gets buy signal, it checks:

1. conditions which you incorporated in 1.6

2. Checks M W D1 candlle, H4 candlle H1, M30M15M5 (user needs to select in ea settings which candles direction will ea look as filter), and user selcted that his additional filter for opening trades are D1 H4 H1.

D1 H4 H1 are GREEN (candles on these 3 tf are going high, higher since opening), ea will execute buyl order that way it doesnt trade against trend on higher tf

This filter should be like
Attached Image

TF direction filter: True/ False

If true:

M5 - True/False

M15 - True/False

M30- True/False

H1- True/False

H4-True/False

D1-True/False

W-True/False

M- True False

Trader selcets combination of the TF filters he wants , so ea will take them in consideration.

For Examplle:

M5, H1, H4,D1,W

In case that original conditions from 1.6 suggest a trade which goes against trend , trade will not be executed

.

i just changed my settings to 5 TP and 10 SL.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Guys, Just a reminder that if you want all of your orders to stay in trade together to hit higher profit, you can adjust your total profit close to higher value(current setting is at 3.9 only). Please refer to the quote above. Otherwise your profit wont go high enough even if your take profit value is bigger than Total profit close.

By the way, this is my result after 10 hours of using latest version(24.4.2017)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The result is not so good, i think is because of the trailling stop ea is not fully utilize. My ronz_Auto is at default setting.  Can any1 share a guide on how to use RONZ_AUTO?

Thanks in advance

Guys I don't want to discourage you , but you cannot put PVSRA into EA without HTMRW knowledge. You can use EA on one specific pair that you know well and use it as an entry tool or MM tool. But trading 28 pairs or anything above 2 or 3..just FORGET IT!!!

PVSRA alone takes months to learn, HTMRW alone takes years to learn and gain expirience with...only after these two conditions are met you can maybe, just maybe think about what I wrote above.

and i close after 30 minutes!!!!! with 4.8 pips profit

i dont know why the ea 1.7 would  open trade here..... price is oversold and close to strong resistance.

the best place for the trade to open is on the pullback to the dragon or when it crosses the dragon with volume. keep trying alaway.

Hello, please can you share your both set files? thx

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Good morning,

These are the results of yesterday with the version 1.6, using SL: 100 and TP: 100, the truth the results were quite promising, 7 pairs are used.

The only thing that seemed strange to me is that sometimes the price did not reach TP and the EA closed the order, I think that happens when a new order appears and an earlier order is still open, EA closes the previous order. I'm not sure.

a greeting.

Kindly use V1.7 to be all of us in the line ..

hi everybody, here are the trades ver 1.6 took yesterday evening after NY close (dead zone). i guess obsolete since we moved to ver 1.7, but i wanted to post anyway. i think i will open up my SL since all but one trade hit SL! the orders i put a line thru were taken manually, so ignore these.

I took this trade on eurusd also.....short@1.09149 with classic settings with ronz auto

Close in profit +10 pips @ 1.09048

--- 帖子 #798 ---
I think it is because of your trailing stop at 50.. thats why it stop at 5 pips..

--- 帖子 #799 ---
@Alawy

You mention a hidden trailing stop.

If i understood well ea will not send every tick tick to the server but it will monitor the trades. If this is true, that is awesome, since i know how trailing stop can mess the brokers servers and results in a platform freezin. Had a ea which was trying to send 10 000 operations in a second.  After one day got a nice replay from a broker that i am not a suitable client for them

--- 帖子 #800 ---
yes , it's hidden and will reduce loss orders

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Thanks for the answer, initially I was on the team chosen also, anyway nothing happens, I will continue testing 1.6 that by now already gives good results.

Today Results

Time Frame: M1

TP: 15

SL: 5

Lock 5 Pips after move 10 Pips using "Ronz EA"

But that EA seems not efficient for handle orders because it move SL TP for trailing stop very slowly.

It's better to have some stealth trade management function inside EA, it will be more effeciant

Also It's better to stop EA after we earn daily target,because it wiped out London and early NY profits later

Today's results with the new 1.7 version.

M1 3SL 3,5TP

So far it fairs better than the previous versions, however, with these settings it was still a losing day. I want to keep the TP low because after all, it's supposed to be a scalping EA, right...SL might have been a little too tight, I will examinate every trade and make adjustments. Problems really only started to arise from NYO, so maybe next time I'm only letting it trade the London session.

Started a forward test using mostly default settings. See image below for details. I will be running this forward test on a dedicated VPS 24/7 without intervention simply to log the trades that are placed. Since we cant do much to change the trade logic, just SL, TP, trailing etc. etc., I am going to let trades accumulate and after a we have sufficient trades we can manually analyze them and get a better idea of what MM to use.

I see a lot of screen shots of the trading history, and a lot of trades closed either in profit or in loss, but I dont see a lot of charts with the trades plotted. That is very important to analyze. Only then can we get a idea of what MM we can use if we ever decide to go live with it. I will come back and post some updates after a few days or a week.

I hope everyone's testing is going well and I hope many green pips to us all.

Best regards.

Have you tried to redownload the files and install again?

--- 帖子 #897 ---
If you dont have any trade going on, i think you should adjust your trade to the range your broker set. Otherwise the EA  won open trade since the max spread is too low.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Morning chaps. Nothing closed over my night with the new settings as expected. 9 unprofitable trades open. The challenge I will address today is to move back to a preset file which will achieve scalping. I guess the thread name - PVSRA Scalping EA - is the lead. ;-)

Hi I'm still out travelling so I can't trade  but I managed to make 2 trades yesterday, this is one of them.

But I have a question about the currencystrenght indicator, it seems like it is not showing the same as others pictures here in this tread, how does this indicator work? where do it get it's information from?

--- 帖子 #910 ---
1.7 from yesterday

initial balance :3000

ron ea tp:500 sl 250

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Hi, not able post much right now, but wanted to let other testers here know that I'm taking 1.7 through a more conservative appriach.

I'm using fewer pairs, fewer trades but a better mm to my liking.

For me, the purpose is to keep it simple, and for the profits to increase slowly and consistantly.

I'll share some screen shots when I get home and after the kids go to sleep

Cheers

My ea got take the 1st trade which is long.. but the second 1.. did not..

however, i find it a bit weird because now im running this ea in 2 demo account with the same broker(FXPRO) and same setting but the trade taken is totally different. Is it normal @ALAWY103?

--- 帖子 #923 ---
I think i figure something will be good to avoid this kind of orders .., any one have idea let me know.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Have been testing different timeframes with 1.7 on EU, UJ and EJ. Results are not very good, i had better results with 1.6.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Actually should this ea trade when its near to previous resistance? if not then maybe can add a little condition to for avoiding trading at previous support and resistance. But if your ea is actually looking to trade a breakout.. then it is doing its job..

Just my thought..

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Alawy i have a question about economic news:

20 minutes before and after news, EA don' enter

But, if i open trades 45 minutes before news, will the EA close the trade before the news?

--- 帖子 #927 ---
No, EA avoid trade in this period only ...

BTW EA V1.8 in the oven ...

Hello all,

my first day, with this EA and WUKAR (Standard).

Not so good :-(. Most Trades are opened on top or bottom and then goes straight to sl.

Alawy, it would help to know the exact trading rules. Maybe you can change something.

Nevertheless, thanks you for your work.

I will try to analyze the trades, perhaps I have an idea.

The EA already have start and end time ...

--- 帖子 #972 ---
I think here the puzzle where we need to solve.

--- 帖子 #973 ---
Closed positions on 1.8. Idea was to trade on ea M5 with 2 magic number(so ea will open 2 orders for every signal) one will close orders at 10 pips other will close orders on MPTMA hidden tp 3pips. Mptma didnt close orders but never the less everything went fine since i used strict filters, to trade only in a trend direction D1, H4H1M15M5M1(this means it will not be to many orders but at least they will be profitable.). Comment cannot be seen...because its long...but i dont think so, since on version 1.6 , 17, was longer.

@Alawy looks like we are on the good track.

Monday to Friday. The results are still unsatisfactory. End of week in loss. I can't send here because the result is bad. Will announce if I find a setting that runs for weeks to get a profit.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
Hi alaway103,

I test on vps since 4-17-2017...v. 1.5,1.6 and ronz tm.

I let i run all time...steady losses until today.

Before LO I loaded 1.7 on seven pair with settings similiar or same

as boxcar...(ty bc) on 1.7 and leave ronz the same as it was.

Unfortunately my information is skewed because I left 1.6 running

on four other pair...(still losing). But I change the lot size on 1.7 to 1

on 1.6 it was .01 you see in trade report info to understand.

Today 1.7 10 wins 1 loss (sl)

Next week will trade London session only and analyze the data over

weekend to see how the trades were closed and if ronz was doing his job

and post settings. Looks promising.

Hi friends,

This is what I got today using only V1.7, M1, with two different terminals. Both running from 8 to 20 (server GMT+2) and not blocking the news. But one terminal was SL100 and TP 200 and the other terminal was SL50 and TP100:

Alawy, here is my result for 1 whole week..next week i will attached the screenshot too since i just know that this ea can take ss also..

1 more thing, this ea is for std account, or ECN account??..im curious, bcoz i got loss in almost trades...

--- 帖子 #990 ---
ea can not take trades when price is overbought/oversold. an rsi or stochastic could help to filter out bad entries. i still think the best time to run it would be for the first hour of london and ny open. no trading on fridays.

Still comment problem exists so its a little harder to see which setup was going better. On setup with 3pips tp i have ea which at 10 pips minus do a hedge trade for 10 tp, since i am aware that 1.8 can sniff out reversals zones either fr breakup or for retrace.

Hi everyone

My results so far on 5 min TF have been average, I have now changed TF to 15 min, hope to get better quality trades.

Also, my TP and SL, has changed from 5 pips to 10 pips.

Lets see how it performs this week.

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Hello, the problem I see is in some trades, the order is closed before reaching the TP, many times this supposes a loss of PIPS, as in this case where EURJPY would have reached its TP.

another trade, TP was 10 pis, trade closed at 6.9 pips.

My results from yesterday, setup is the same as on my previous post:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Filters are working great as i expected, next thing to improve is a way how tou counter the extreme zone sell or buy. I am using a MPTPA which is hedging trades if they got o -10 pips. So far working great. It would be good to add this in next version of ea. It shoud work like this:

1Hedge trades in minus xx pips(ea will automaticlly open counter trade )

2.Lot size hedge trade / xx lots

3. Close order on Break even/ summ of losing trade+summ of hedging trade=+1

4. Hedge tp

5.Hedge sl

I am writing this since i noticed that pvsra can find real goldmine with extreme zones, either break out in which case hedge will not be activated or rejection zone which will activate hedge.

Hi I was wondering if it is possible to make an option where you can choose to only trade one pair at the time? Yes I know about Max Orders.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
I have a huge problem regarding this

mptma is managing only magic number 3333, for 3tps and he for -10pips for tp 10 pips. When hedge order is open instead of 10 pips tp its closed on 3 pipps, because ea is opening trades under 3333 magic number and tp is hidden for 3 pip....so ea needs to be corrected to give hedge orders  new magic number .

These are my results for the last 2 days on V1.8

My EA settings are as per post 1045, 20 SL and 10 TP , no MM EA used, just 1.8

You will see loses near the top of the screen, that was using 5M TF first, than changed it to 15 min.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

My results for just today using 15 min TF are also good.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If the EA could average 20-50 pips....it would be definitely be a super EA in my books. The test will be, can it do it consistently over a longer period of time, if not daily, weekly or even monthly.

Thanks AlAwy for the EA.

Cheers

Ezzy

Guys with version 1.8 - please send me the latest version via PM. I am tester #2 on the list in the first post but cant get a hold of Alawy for some time already.

Hi Zazox

Pity the VPS time is being wasted...

Hi Friends,

Here are my trades for the last 2 days (4th and 5th), using M1 in 2 terminals, SL50 TP100 and SL100 TP200.

The strategy of using a higher TP than SL did not perform well on M1 this week. I´ll switch to M5 for next week.

Fibo38, da igual que cambies el TP a 200 si mantienes el TotalProfitClose en 15.0

Cuando llegues a 15 euros de ganancias te cerrará la operación aunque pongas un TP de 200 o de 400.

Todas tus ganancias se cierran sobre esa cifra.

From my point of View no EA will able to manage all market condition or we need all EA on different account but for than we need more capital

So we need to have SIX EA to manage all market conduction.

Low Volatility

Run only on ranging market

Run only on BULL market

Run only on Bear market

High Volatility

Run only on ranging market

Run only on BULL market

Run only on Bear market

And look more carefully - this thread is nearly dead - the activity is very low here .....

Hello alawy103,
I am a late comer but I am a long fan of both you & cigarguy.

Unfortunately I had been in this thread in early days (#23), but could not continue.

Now, with your permission, i would like to be with the thread.

I shall be highly obliged if you could send me the password.

Best Regards,

kkb2k8

Hi alway,

Itried this EA on live account. It is not working. Let me know what am I trying wrong. The other EA Wucker seems to be active but has not taken any trade. Not sure if this really works or am I just wondering. Let me know how to get it running. Thanks =

To the Author of this EA! Please post EXPIRED EA at the 1st page. Wasted my time reading thru this to find out it is EXPIRED!

Waste of time!!!

Normally there is a warning about expiry but I guess not this time. In any case Jobydon stated above that it doesn't work.

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
Very bad. It's expired and no source code.
