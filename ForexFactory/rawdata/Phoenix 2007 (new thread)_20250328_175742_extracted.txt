It’s time to start a new thread about &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. And let’s call it “Phoenix &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="2007”"&gt;2007”&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt;. Because Phoenix 2007 is not finished yet, you will find the latest version (4.2) here to play with.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; What’s the idea behind Phoenix 2007:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I’m one of these guys that believes that everything in this world is subject to some kind of natural law. The effects of these laws are known as patterns or cycles that seems to repeat themselves over and over again. Some of these patterns or cycles are well known: seasonal changes, day and night, the cycle of live and death, phases of the moon and so on. If you have knowledge of these patterns then you are able to predict the future. We all agree that after a summer there will be a winter. Is Forex subject to these laws too? Yes, I believe it is. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; When we are studying our charts (the past) through Technical Analyses, we are trying to discover those repeating patterns, assuming that when these patterns are repeating themselves in the past they will do so in the future. Looking for patterns on charts has only one disadvantage: we can only discover patterns that are visible to the eye. And here comes my point: it’s my belief that there are a lot more patterns in Forex than the ones you can see on your charts! Let’s call them “hidden patterns”. And that’s where MT4 with its Strategy Tester comes on stage. By using the power of your PC and MT4 it seems that it’s possible to find those “hidden patterns”. You can’t see this patterns on your chart and they only reveal themselves to you as that special combination of settings that gives you the best Net Profit.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; And that’s the idea behind Phoenix2007: keep on testing and changing until you have found this special combination of settings, that gives you a smooth up going balance-curve. There’s no doubt about it that this balance-curve will continue in the same direction for at least the coming four to eight weeks because the law that’s causing this won’t stop or change. Only thing to be done is backward test every 2 weeks to see if the settings are still up to date. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I know that some people will call this “curve-fitting” or “over-optimizing” an EA. And it seems that most of them thinks it’s not desirable. In my opinion there’s nothing wrong with “curve-fitting” in this case. More about this later. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I’ve made a special version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; for the “Automated Trading Championship &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="2006”"&gt;2006”&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt;. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Go to http://championship.mql4.com/2006/participants if you want to follow the results. That little man in the second place “Hendrick” that’s me.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; And now some “rules of the game”:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; You can the change the code of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; if you want to, but please don’t post it in this thread!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Some of you will going to test (I hope) &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and will come up with different settings. It’s not that I don’t trust your settings but I really want to test these settings first in my own way. And if they are better I will replace the official settings with your settings. This to prevent that too many settings are circulated in the thread and in the end nobody knows which settings have to be used.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Warning: &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The combination of pair, TimeFrame, TP, SL and other settings are in “balance”. If you change one of them without changing the other settings the balance will be gone and you will not get the results you want to have, So changing one of the settings means that you have to use your Strategy Tester to find another combination of settings to restore the balance again.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The following files are attached:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; HowToUsePhoenix.pdf An explanation about the settings of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; ModellingQuality.pdf A short manual about how to get a 90% modeling quality when using the Strategy Tester of MT4.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Phoenix_EA_v4_2_01.mq4 The EA itself. Version 2007 will follow as soon as possible. The settings for the pairs are for now hard coded in the EA. Every time the settings changes, the last two figures at the end will change (so next time the EA will be renamed to Phoenix_EA_v4_2_02)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; OfficialSettings2006_10_8.txt The latest settings for &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. Look at the date at the end (format YYYY_MM_DD). You have to copy and paste these settings in the EA or you can install the latest version of the mq4-file where I will change the settings for the pairs.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Well, that's it. Let’s work all together and try to improve Phoenix 2007! ==========UPDATES========================= 2006.10.9 New version Phoenix_EA_v4_2_02. Fix for problem with certain mini-accounts where the broker uses an "m" behind a pair (so USDJPYm instead of USDJPY).

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Attached you find the results of a forward test from 2006.09.12 to 2006.10.6. There has been a lot of tweaking during this period, but Phoenix made in spite of this a nice profit. If you don't take the results of the AUDUSD and EURAUD in account and the still open trades (account is now closed) Phoenix turned a 5K account into almost 8K in a short period. And thats not too bad for a start I think.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hendrick, Congratulation also on this new thread. 1st page is very well detailed with your conceptional idea for Phoenix and base files for us to use and excellent information for entry level people to get started. To do this takes a tremendous amount of developement and support time and it is very, very appreciated. If we do not hear from you for some period of time in the future, we will know that your wife has locked you out of the room where your PC is located. Good health and have another glass of wine. Wackena

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi hendrick, wish you all the best with the improvement of Phoenix 2007. May i know what is the method behind this EA?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Congrets indeed on your new thread! Got MT all set up to do some forward testing next week (on all the pairs included in settings file). Can't wait for the market to open again! Will keep everyone posted. I might have been the last one to post in your previous thread but let me be one of the first to post here ;-) Cheers and enjoy the rest of the weekend! Vince

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi Hendrick, Thank you again for your willingness to share your ideas and abilities with us. Congratulations on your competition efforts. All that you are doing is quite extraordinary. Kind Regards, Grahame

--- 帖子 #7 ---
How did you knew that Wackena! She's really threatening to do so you know! Oh well.. some time without Phoenix shouldn't be that bad. Or..? Cheers mate!

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Mine is just about to do the same... he he Thanks for all the helpful posts Hendrik - manual etc., I'm still having a problems with the laptop starting backtests... I've followed all the instructions to the letter and still she won't see the data or takes only a few (3) trades. I have a friend returning from Italy this week who is an MT4 expert (that sounds funny) and he should be able to figure it out. Looking forward the Duo Core backtests... All the best to you Hendrick Joe

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Congratulation too!! and handrick,i think you should also explanation the default broke MT platform e.g. based on the NEXTT (GMT+2) or FXDD(GMT+3) Good health and Kind Regards appleparty

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi Vince! It was nice talking to you in the Private Mail (for the rest, we're both Dutch). If you want to do a forward test on your demo then try the pairs I think are the most profitable: USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY, EURUSD, CHFJPY, USDCHF and USDCAD.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Apple, My broker is NEXTT. But I don't think the GMT is of any importance. Let your demo's run for 24 hours a day.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Joe, Let me know if your friend is able to find the solution. If not, don't hesitate to PM me or put your problem to this thread. Im sure we will get this backtests properly running on your laptop.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
The championship results look good. How did the expert back test compare with the live results so far?&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #14 ---
let's update the P4_2_1!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
So far the live results did exactly what I expected it to do. The nice and smooth up going balance curve is continuing its direction! To be honest I have really no idea how long this upwards direction will continue. To my calculation it should last for another 2 or 3 months. Should be enough for the contest (we can't change the settings). &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Enjoyed it too! Cheers! I'll take you for 'a spin' one day! OK, have those pairs ready to go up now. Question about back testing/optimising. What period in the past do you use for your optimising? I could imagine a too long a period will cause the problem that the EA is optimised over f.i. a year but will not be best on a shorter period. On the other hand, if you use a too short a period you might miss out on 'good things' to profit from on a bigger scale? Did you have any specific period in mind?&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Thanks!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi, &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Speaking of which.. Anybody already testing with a dual core (sorry if it's a bit off topic... but seems to be quite a bit of interest about it here... If not appreciated please let me know!) I've ordered one and should be here soon.. Does anyone know if MT4 is already optimised for these chips? If not, I'm not convinced that my new dual core Athlon 64 x2 4800 (so 2 x 2.4Ghz) will be much quicker than my P4 3Ghz single core laptop... Maybe even slower!!! Will hopefully be able to post my verdict soon! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hey Vince, I always use 6 months. This is far out the best period to backward test Phoenix!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
FYI. In my tests between a P4 3.2 GHZ and a 64bit Athlon X2 4.2 GHZ, the dual core athlon completes a one month per tick backtest in about 1 minute 30 seconds while the p4 takes 6 minutes. This was testing a EA that made about 2000 trades in that period. Fairly impressive spanking of the p4 by the dual core.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I'm very, very, very interested!! If this new dual core can speed up my tests, that would be great. Anyone??

--- 帖子 #21 ---
If anyone is forward testing Phoenix for the next week, will you please post your statements on a daily basis and don't forget the broker you're using for your demo. I want to compare your trades against mine. If someone is testing on a live micro-account then I'm very interested in the results. So it's micro-account and not mini-account.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hendrick, On forward demo tests that have been running a week or two - do you want us to immediately implement new settings when you post them in the thread? or Do you want us to keep the old settings for comparison against the new settings others are using? Nice new thread, good first post. Are they going to post your interview under the news tab on the Trading Championship web site?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hendrick: I'm on it. Congrats on the AutoTrade Championship!!! My guns are loaded so it's off to battle once again....

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Plamer! It's you, me, the strawberries and the Contest!! Take care mate!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I've been trading for 12 years and only 4 years ago did I finally realize this. Good to see that someone else out there believes the same thing ;-) Good luck to you in your venture! Kal

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Concerning that PM about the TS set to 5, make that 20..

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Sharing my experience. Core 2 Duo beats X2, X2 beats P4. Very obvious! But! Single or duo core doesn't matter to backtesting because MT4 is not optimized for using multiple cores. So it doesn't matter if you are using a AMD X-2 or a single core running AMD64 running the same speed. (2.4Ghz for example. you won't really notice.) The tast will be shared by both cpu's both running little above 50%, depends on how many aplications you're running at the same time. The more you're running, the bigger the difference between them. Best is when you have 2 MT4 platforms running and both are running backtest. Then you will notice the difference between single and dual core.

Hendrix, could u help me in that whats the time frame that phoenix will start trading after its turned on.. My broker is CFG and the firebird EA's seems to trade just fine. I have 10k in a live acct and I loaded up Phoenix v4-2 last week and it never made a trade. So, I have just loaded up v4-2-01 today. What steps do I need to do to make it happen..Appriciate any help u can give.....TX Kevin

--- 帖子 #29 ---
This is what I've done: Stick the EA in the Metatrader 4\experts directory + restart Metatrader. Load up 15 min charts for the pairs you wanna run the EA on. Drag and drop the EA from the Navigator window onto each chart. Confirm the EA params. Now you should see the EA name and a smiley face in the top right of the chart. I've got it running on USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY, EURUSD, USDCHF and USDCAD and so far its opened 2 trades (usdjpy sell @ 118.96, gbpjpy buy @ 222.41). Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hendrick, Today I tried to use Phoenix v4.2 on USDJPYm IBFX Mini Live Account and it would not place an order. I also tried to backtest in the Mini Account and still would not place order. If I have UseSignal2 and UseSignal3 = false, then it will place order, but results not so good. I thought it might be a digit problem with jpy currency, but the EA will not place order on GBPUSD or other currencies. On standard North Finance backtest and forward test Demo, it runs just fine. Also, back testing on standard IBFX and FXDD Demo worked OK. I don't know why this is so on the IBFX Mini Account, yet. I will try to determine the problem and report. Any ideas? Wackena

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Yeah I have done just that, but it will not take a trade...I'm completely lost. I have the smiley face, but still no trades taken. Weird the firebird will take trades...I have no idea what to do with Phoenix..................

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I found the reason. In my IBFX Mini account the charts have a "m" added to each currency pair. Example: USDJPYm. I added a "m" to the USDJPY symbol in the PrefSettings and it now places orders. So everyone be aware that Phoenix v4.2 will not work "As Is" on a IBFX mini account that has a "m" suffix to each chart currency pair. It's a simple fix and Hendrick will advise how to modify EA. Wackena

--- 帖子 #33 ---
come on guys, please give me some Ideas on how to get this Phoenix working to take trades.....................................................

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Have you tried what wackena said? Try running a dummy EA and see what the Symbol() function is giving you. If it is something like USDJPYm then modify the EA and put "m" at the end of all the symbols hardcoded in the mq4 file. Eg. change: if(Symbol() == "USDJPY") to: if(Symbol() == "USDJPYm")

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Awesome, Can,t wait for this fix..Want real bad to get this working right. Please advise for the fix....TX Kevin

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thats weird , whats the m have to do with it anyway.........

--- 帖子 #37 ---
For some reason, a good one I'm sure or maybe a bad one, this broker and maybe others decided they needed a "m" suffix to currency pairs to identify this as a Mini Account. Wackena

--- 帖子 #38 ---
If that was the case, why does the firebird take trades..Its a mini account.. Doesn't make sence

--- 帖子 #39 ---
FB doesn't have "if Symbol()=USDJPY" and = other pairs as part of PrefSettings in its code and Phoenix v4.2 does. Wackena

--- 帖子 #40 ---
well, I put m after the currency pairs in both the demo and the live acct and the demo has taken two trades, but no trades on the live as of yet..Will wait and see. Tx for your help...................

--- 帖子 #41 ---
i hope your EA places really well in the championship. that Russian in 1st place is cruising. I should log in very five minutes and steal his signals for a live account...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hedrick, Thanks for carrying on with Phoenix in the new thread and for the new manual &amp; updated settings for 4.2. I added 4 new pairs to my demo account for a total of 7 that you recommended, all with the new settings in your initial post of this new thread. I will start forward testing these tonight EST in the US. I will try to update the list daily if possible and no less than weekly. Congratulations on your present position in 2nd place in the contest. I'm proud to know you. I've never known anyone from the Netherlands. By the way, you write and I assume speak, excellent English. I am, however, still curious about how Phoenix "works." I'm a novice in programming but I'm assuming from what I can gather that the premise is based on an envelope similar to Firebird (but greatly sophisticated). I know that you are "teasing" us and will gradually reveal more details about the basis of Phoenix as it evolves...however, a little more factual info (as well as the philosophy of Phoenix and optimization of EA's you've offered) would help us to help you in its development. I want you to know that we all appreciate your great work...and don't forget to give your wife the time she deserves...it will actually make you more productive in the end and make for a happier household and life. Mike Johnson aka 1Trader2

Going to start a demo FXDD $10k tonight. FB 1a US/Jap M5 FB 1.0C1 Aud/US M5 US/CHF Phoenix M15 US/Cad Phoenix M15 CHF/Jap Phoenix M15 GBP/Jap Phoenix M15 Euro/Jap Phoenix M15 and another pair (undecided) FB H4 TS MM M5 anyone know if the EuroX2 EA works??? i'd like to add a good Euro/US EA and a GBP/US EA.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
There is an active thread on EuroX2 on forex-tsd I personally wouldn't throw money at it in a hurry...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I just noticed one thing with thing with this EA. It still says Pheonix3 in the comment field. Not a big deal unless you are reporting off that field.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Nvwine, I think it's better to switch over to the new settings. Yes I think the interview will be under the news tab. I believe somewhere this week.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Kal, I'm looking for people that experienced these cycles/patterns in their daily practice. So if you have the time one of these days maybe you can tell me more about what you have found. Thanks.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Mike, I will give you more information about the working of Phoenix as soon as possible. You can also read more about it in the interview that will be published somewhere this week on the Contest site. And you're absolutly right about the time I have to give to my wife (and the rest of my familiy).

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Oops, you're right.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
New version Phoenix (4_2_02) in first post. Fixed a problem with certain micro-accounts where the broker puts a "m" behind the pairs (so USDJPYm instead of USDJPY).

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi Hendrick, nice to see that you're still putting so much effoert into Phoenix. I really didn't like the path of development Phoenix took so I looked for other strategies / EAs. However, I didn't really find any which is as good as Phoenix. Additionally, I don't like Phoenix R:R (risk-reward-ratio) because the S/L is so much bigger than the T/P. Well....but now, I'm gonna try it again because these forward test results are amazing...

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Do you guys have recomendations for which broker to use on a LIVE mini account for this strategy? PS. I've read you entire thread (this one) and it's much easier to digest when there are only a couple of pages long. PPS. Also I love your idea of posting the EA to the first thread, makes it SO much easier to find. But may I sugest that you keep the old ones there as well. It will allow you to go back in time if you want to undo some changes. Also usefull for reference when you want to see at which point in time you introduced a particular feature.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hey Tradeigel! There you are! Thought you abandoned me! &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; In the case of a TP of 42 and a SL 84 we have a negative RRR and that's something you have to avoid. On the other hand some EA's needs enough space to develop their trades. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is in essence a counter-trend EA. When it opens a trade you will often see that the price at first goes against it. If your SL is too low your trade will then be closed to early and in loss. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I think I'm going to make a different set of settings for those who want to test a different RRR. What about a 1:1 ratio? &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hendrick...OK, PrefSettings is true but I have MM set to false to trade mini's and the TS is a gonner...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
yeah, that's probably better...I only wonder if it works :/

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I'm just thining out loud here...US holiday, Japan 'Sports Day', and the N. Korean nuclear test...are we in for a volatility spike? Please note: when I think out loud I make less sense vs. thinking to myself. I still haven't cleaned my room.....

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi Hendrick, As mentioned I've just started a forward test on demo accounts with 3 brokers (space fx, interbank fx, and metatradeer) using the latest that you posted in your first post. Will try to update my results on a daily basis. BTW, did you incorporate your latest settings into the EA or should I copy it from the settings file? I'm just asking because I'm wondering which ones you will keep up to date ... is the EA always going to have the latest, or are the settings file going to be the latest?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Good question! I forgot to mention the difference. When the settings file changes so will the EA. So you can copy and paste the new settings in the EA or just install the new EA.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
So in that case I can assume that the EA will always have the latest and greatest!!! Makes life easier to work with. I havn't been running this set-up for less then an hour and there are already differences in the trades being taken depending on the broker. On Interbank FX I have two trades open while the others are yet to open a position. I'm running this on ALL of the charts available at each broker. Catch ya.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Fantastic results so far in the World Championship! I am rooting for you to win. I only wish my own EA EverLong was doing as well in the standings. What ever I can do on this thread to help with the development of Phoenix I will do it. Thanks for sharing all of your hard work with the rest of us and I can't wait to read your interview.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hey Hendrick, I think your wife would like if you won the first or maybe second price in the championship. I would like that, too. Because then she wouldn't look you up anymore.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Short recap: Phoenix 4.2 first day with new settings. Not too bad I think. Your results should the same!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
There's a setting in Phoenix called MaximumRisk. What's the meaning of this parameter? It's a parameter used by the Money Management function. I think I can show the effects best by two examples: USDJPY from 2006.3.22 to 2006.9.22 with MaximumRisk=0.05 and with MaximumRisk=0.5. Well, look at the results. If you really have confidence in an EA and you want to be rich in 6 months....! But remember, setting the MaximumRisk is at your own risk!!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Hendrick, Here are my results up to 1:15PM EST...pretty darn good I think although not same as yours.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Howdy, Differences starting to show already after 1 day between different brokers! I've included two statements. One from the 'standard' Metaquotes software, the other one was FXDD. KR

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi Piper, Don't worry. It's almost the same.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Vince! Yes, different, but they all goes the same way...upwards!!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hell yeah! Up, up and away!!!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Enclosed is my result of today with Phoenix 4.2. Thank Goodness, others have better results!

Hi Hendrick, Running from yeasterday. Broker IBFX. Demo account. My respect to your work. -snoopy

--- 帖子 #73 ---
man , wish I could get this working..I added the m but still no trades...any ideas......................must be the broker CFG????????????

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Does your borker offer mini, micro or nano lots? Some brokers do, and some don't.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
You may have already been asked about these: 1. Do you see suffix "m" on charts? Example: USDJPYm. 2. Any errors in Experts or Journal tabs? 3. Will EA place order in Backtest? 4. Does EA work on different Broker platform? Post your EA "As Is" and I will test. Wackena

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hendrick, Can we run Phoenix on the same pair more than one time in the same demo account by changing the value of MAGICMA and creating a newly named EA for each identical pair's chart? For example running Phoenix on 3 different EURUSD charts in the same demo. The reason being to compare settings real time on a forward test. I have noticed almost no EURCHF trades. Is this do to a lack of daily range? Looking at all the posted results inspired me to hurry my results out. All tests run 24 hours a day for the trading week on 15min charts with MM = true and Preferred settings = true. On my live account the equity is about the same as Friday night. Averaging over 100 pips a day is great though. The test has been running on an IBFX mini account trading smaller than micro lots for 2 days. The results are in the attached PDF file. All settings were updated yesterday and are as shown at the bottom of the pdf file. I am using money management but each day that continues to show promise I'm raising the risk three tenths of a percent. This is the reason the lot size 'is and hopefully will' be increasing faster than the account balance would dictate. The alpari demo ran the first day with only the Japanese pairs. I added some pairs to it. I updated to the new EA that was posted yesterday. The MetaQuotes demo is lagging. It is running on all pairs available from MQ that Phoenix has settings for. I did not update this EA's settings consistently. I hope that is why it is not displaying results that are as stellar as other tests. I updated to the new EA that was posted yesterday.

Hendrick, Please find attached results for today. The results are mixed because of the earlier version running. There was a loss from gbpjpy and a profit on eurjpy entered on 10/6. Last night I added all the recommended pairs posted earlier with the new version. The trades entered in the last 24 hours are as follows: gbpjpy.................$105.80 profit eurusd.................open pos flt eurjpy................. open neg flt usdcad................ open neg flt gbpjpy................. open neg flt The statement is attached but looks deceptive because of the losses from the 10/6 trades. The actual profit from the new version is the $105.80. I'm looking forward to seeing what she'll do. So far so good! 1Trader2

Daily log 7 of 9... I'm forward testing with the standard MT4 account (MIG). Attached is the statement so far.

Hendrick After thestruggle on the runway Phoenix got airborne! It is now a question of wait and see. I started it on 26/09 on InterbankFX and it took a negative turn for a while. Trading 4 pair USD/JPY, Eur/Jpy, GBP/JPY. USD/CHF - changed settings as you made it available. Ben

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi, Great idea to increase the RiskFactor that way. Think I will make some code for this for Phoenix 5. You can run Phoenix on the same pair more than one time if you change the MagicNumer (MAGICMA) in the code. The settings for the EURCHF needs to be improved.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Several of the markets were stuck in a range becuase of the holiday and according to the positions I have open, I may start out in the negative. I'm not sure how a rangebound market affects P4....we'll see. GBPJPY two winners in a row because of movement though...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi Hendrick, I started 10.08.06. Default settings, all 12 pairs. My broker is IBFX. So far mixed results. BTW I am also testing your Contest version. Started with $10000. So far 1 trade $1053.86 profit.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi everyone, this is my first post and you'll note that my english is awfull. I want to congrats Hendrick for the World Champions and for make possible that everyone tests this great EA. My questions: Where i could find the Contest Version of Phoenix? Is possible conciliate 2 EA's so they work in different hours? Like, some EA works well at trendmarket and another works in news moment... Thank u all, and sorry about my english...

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Hendrick, As requested here are some statements from the 3 brokers that I'm running this on. These are ALL demo accounts. So far all profitable trades except for USDCAD for which if I'm not mistaken then there are no settings. If it only were real money ... oh well, when I get more confidence I'll plunk down some real money on this. Then the results WILL be worth watching.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Doesn't matter if your English is awful, as long as we understand you . Here's the link to Contest Phoenix: http://championship.mql4.com/2006/us..._4_CONTEST.mq4

Strange Saltcafe all these differences!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Tom, What I need for the contest is that the USDJPY has to go down! It's only a few pips away from my stoploss. Oh well, we have still a long way to go!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hey Palmer, How's P4 doing so far! We need some movement on the market! If I'm not mistaking then Phoenix performs at its best when the market gets really volatile. I just checked the Contest. Dropped from the second to sixth place!! We have still a long way to go.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Regarding the back-testing file that Hendrick provided on the first page. Did anyone try to do it? I have problems with the conversion of the 1 min data to other time frames. I did everything as Hendrick described and checked it twice. The very last step does not seem to work. I opened the period_converter and did everything that I should. After the waiting period of 30 sec, I did the next one and hit OK every time. The window disappears as Hendrick said, and so on, but... When I restart and cancelled the account requests, it comes back to the black offline window, but the time boxes on top are not available to go to other time frames. If I go to the history files, the other time frames are empty. Do anybody know what I did wrong?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hello Benna. I think you did everything ok. The thing you need to do now is to open your 'Strategy Tester' (Go: "View"; "Strategy tester" or press CTRL -R). In this screen you can backtest your EA. Make sure you select the right currency pair (the one you just converted) and select the correct timeframe (m15 for Phoenix). Under "Expert properties" you change the settings you want to try. Make sure you select MM to false (gives a better 'objective' picture in my humble opinion) and 'PrefSettings' false. You will need to enter all other settings manually. Once a test is done you should check the 'Report' tab to see if your 'Moddelling quality' is 90.00%. Let me know how you get on! Good luck, Vince

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I just got back from lunch and checked on P4...Saw there were three losses in a row, three more open. I'm wondering if the FOMC minutes has control of the EA right now....I'll post the details this evening...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi all, here are my statements of yesterday + 2day. I've added an account which uses North Finance's server. Please note this one started much later. Note 2: my internet connection has been VERY unstable 2day so I'm very curious how all of you did 2day?! Cheers

Bye. -snoopy

--- 帖子 #95 ---
The following REALY does my head in.... Been doing a lot of back testing lately and came across something weird... When I back test in Metatrader (downloaded from metaquotes) I get different result then when I back test with Metatrader downloaded from FXDD. 1) I've checked the versions and they are both Version 4.00 Build 197 (12 Sept 2006). 2) I use a *.set file for the settings so they are the same. 3) Used the same *.hst file to load the most accurate history data. Anyone else ever had the same problem??? If so any idea what to do about it? This does sort of defeats the use of back testing otherwise... I've included 2 reports so you can see for yourself... Thanks!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Could the servers these two different versions are connecting to be different? If so have you checked the server time zone settings? not sure if this is the case but its worth checking. Good luck, Ah.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Statement as of 10/10/06 with standard MT4 broker (MIG). 5 targets hit, 2 stops hit. USD/JPY is very close to stop loss - What are people's views on this pair? Also seems to have opened a buy on EUR/USD - was this a good idea?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
It is a good thing there is a lot of the trading contest still to go. It looks like we will lose the USDJPY. Sorry Hendrick. For the rest of us loosing on some pairs can be expected it is the overall gain that is important. I got a EURCHF trade and it looks profitable. My new concern is GBPCHF. I have had 2 trades in 3 days. One stopped out for a loss the other is 40 pips down as of this writing. I'll have to watch that pair over the next ten days. After 3 days the equity in my live IBFX mini account still reflects a hundred pip per day average. This is very good. I posted info about these accounts last night in post #76.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Here's what I've got with FXDD trading mini's...I'm Central Time Zone US....

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Oh, yeah I initially had a TS in set at 20 so that's why that 2nd trade looks a little 'thin'. There are five positions open right now with a floating PL of about $63 in the negative....mini's.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi Hendrick, thanks for sharing your system. I downloaded &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1 lace&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and put it on a M15 USDJPY chart. Then, I decided to place on the chart the indicators that &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1 lace&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; uses as signals, so that I can actually see what &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1 lace&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is thinking. So, I put the Envelopes indicator (&lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1 lace&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;’s first signal) on the chart setting the parameters as per the &lt;st1:City&gt;&lt;st1 lace&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; parameters for USDJPY. Period = 2 MA method = Simple Apply to = Close Deviation percent = 0.0032 The result looked strange, the envelopes had almost merged together as one line. Perhaps I entered the parameters wrong, so I check the Envelopes properties window and the deviation percent was 0.00 not 0.0032. OK, so I must have typed it in wrong, so I re-enter 0.0032, but the same thing happened. In the Envelopes properties window 0.0032 always becomes 0.00 when you re open the properties window. It is like the deviation percent will only accept a value of two decimal places and the rest is truncated. If this is true of the indicator placed on a chart does the Envelopes indicator behave in the same way when running in an EA? i.e. when the EA runs, does it turn 0.0032 into 0.00 for USDJPY? For GBPJPY turn 0.0072 into 0.00 ? For CHFJPY turn 0.012 into 0.01 ? etc So, I did the following with the strategy tester. 1. Ran Phoenix on the strategy tester on USDJPY with the "Percent" parameter left as 0.0032. 2. When it finished clicked on the Open Chart button. 3. On the chart that opened up, I looked at the Envelopes deviation percent parameter, it was 0.10 not 0.0032 What happened? Was0.0032 truncated to 0.00? Did the system therefore use the default value of 0.10 ??????? Perhaps I am doing something wrong? Can anyone please explain? Many thanks, Mark

--- 帖子 #102 ---
FXDD sucks P4 has settings for CHF/Jap and GBP/Jap i see many of you trade GBP/Jap there is no option for these pairs on FXDD, unless someone knows how to 'customise' pairs there.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi bradman, I trade with FXDD and there on my platform, the mt4. The way i get to all the pairs click on file hit new chart and down toward the bottom you'll see forex scroll down to that and it should bring all the pairs up. I hope this is of some help....Valerie......

--- 帖子 #104 ---
P4 has been doing very nicely with GBP/JPY so far... 3 out of 3 targets hit, 4th one on the way Well done!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Palmer, Are you stll using a TS?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
third time trying to post this. laptop has EAs running and the currencies were not there. standard computer has same FXDD account and the other currencies are there. nz and mex etc as well FXDD wierd, or these computers...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Mark, If you place the indicators with these settings on your chart then indeed you see something that doesn't make sense at all. With Phoenix I'm trying to discover patterns/cycles that you will not see with Technical Analyses on your chart. I will give a further explanation later.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi Hendrick, Thanks for your work. Regarding the indicator you are using, I got confused about OsMA. From MT help manual, the OSMA is used as: &lt;TABLE class=docvar cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR vAlign=top&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;NOBR&gt; double iOsMA (&lt;/NOBR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt; string symbol, int timeframe, int fast_ema_period, int slow_ema_period, int signal_period, int applied_price, int shift)&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt; In your EA, it is used as: double OsMABar2=iOsMA(NULL,0,OSMASlow,OSMAFast,OSMASignal,PRICE_CLOSE,2); double OsMABar1=iOsMA(NULL,0,OSMASlow,OSMAFast,OSMASignal,PRICE_CLOSE,1); I noticed that OSMASlow is passed down to parameter fast_ema_period, and OSMAFast to slow_ema_period. If we put the indicator OsMA with the seting in the code in the chart, we would got the different values. Just wonder if the switch is made purposely. Thanks again for your nice work. forex4syg

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi, You're right, this is confusing, but in my tests I'ved switched slow and fast several times (in the code) to see what the effects would be. I leave it this way for now because otherwise the settings won't fit anymore. I will change this for Phoenix 5. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Hendrick, I agree with you. I'm myself astounded why there would be such a huge discrepency. At the moment if I look at the accounts I have: Space FX: with 10870 equity Strategy Builder FX: with 9880 equity Interbank FX: with 10616 equity I will post detailed statements again towards the later part of the afternoon. This looks like any strategy is either doomed to failure on one broker while can thrive on another ... now take you pick as to where you would be lucky! Between you and me, I have to admit that the only REAL way of gaining broker independance would be to set-up up a quarum of broker feeds (at least 3, preferably 5) and use that as the price feed for the calculation, then place trades not at market but with predefined leves for price, SP &amp; TP. But unfortunatelly this is only really theory, since it is not really possible within the current framework available to us. Only can dream about this at the moment. Talk later.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks for your reply Achilles Heel. I looked in to it and found there is a time difference of 1 hour indeed between the two. I was aware there are different times on different broker servers but I always thought, when *back testing*, MT4 would starts at the same time/point.... For instance always at 00:00 GMT.. Apparently not then.. Did most back testing with my FXDD account so will probably use this one as a 'master' and once in a while double check settings on other MetaTraders.. Cheers

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I just received the following mail from MetaQuotes: Go Hendrick!

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hendrick: No, I got rid of the TS. That floating PL has creeping back up to the plus side this morning...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I liked your interview ... but no mention of the EA’s placing trades on multiple currencies. Was that an editorial cut from the interview?&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Today's results posted for comparison purposes. Space FX is powering ahead, while StrategyBuilder is in the doldrums. Interbank is somewhere in the middle. It looks like a race between identical cars, problem is that the cars are identical and the circuit is supposed to be the same as well, but alas it doesn't appear to be so. I'm beginning to think that to truly test this system (or any other MT4 based EA) then you really need to open up a couple of brokers (at least 3) and then do a compare to be able to determine if your system is actually profitable.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I just forgot! Sorry! Will try to mail them this week.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Boring, boring, and boring!! Another boring day! Nothing really moves. But let’s wait for tomorrow. A lot of economic news. That should really shake up the currencies. And if I'm not mistaking &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will perform better as soon things gets moving.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; And if you want to know what your open trades will do, visit this site:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; http://www.mizuho-cb.co.uk/TresInter...X_-_Majors.htm &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Very good!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #118 ---
OK. Let’s talk about the MaximumRisk parameter in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt;. But first what do you expect from Forex? What do you expect from a MetaTrader Expert Advisor like &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;? Are you happy with a lot of small gains or are you going for the Big Money?&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Well, if you like me then you’re not satisfied with the small gains but you want to improve your financial situation drastically. That means go for the Big Money and take some risks. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; These are the results for a six months backward test for the GBPUSD (4.2 – 10.2)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; MM=false Lots=1&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Net Profit 14.888 (MD=5.92%)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; MM=true MaximumRisk=0.05 (default)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Net Profit 10.115 (MD=7.24%)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; MM=true MaximumRisk=0.1&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Net Profit 29.117 (MD=14.8%)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; MM=true MaximumRisk=0.12&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Net Profit 40.598 (MD=16.95%)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; If you really trust &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and if your back and forward testing shows you the results you want, then there’s nothing against increasing the MaximumRisk.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; In my opinion &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 will make you money. It’s your choice to be satisfied with a couple of small gains or to change the MaximumRisk parameter in order to get a bigger piece of the cake. Personally I know what to do!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; (If you’re going live with &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; then be aware that Forex is a risky business. You and you alone are responsible for what you are doing or willing to do with &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. Don’t come to me when things went wrong!)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Harry: I think testing EA's are like being on a diet. Weighing yourself every day doesn't really tell you much. Jumping on the scale at the end of every week or two weeks may give a better feeling for what is going on. I've got an Excel spreadsheet going that will track every trade as a total PL and will track every pair as a total PL for that pair as well. I'm keeping the defaults as is (as are?) and will run the EA for the month to see how things work out. I'll show the results every few days as well. I can't remeber my demo account login info right now, thought I'd take a quick peek at work, so I'll see what's up when I get back to the house..... As far as what I want P4 to do for me...Let me retire tomorrow. Is that too much to ask? My future is in your hands....

--- 帖子 #122 ---
3 more reports. Again, the North Finance account was started about a day late. So far I've been only forward testing 6 pairs but will start all 'supported' currencies within an hour or so. Just gives a better picture I suppose.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = u1 /&gt;&lt;u1 &gt;&lt;/u1 &gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I think you are right Palmer about what you say that it more useful to wait a while and not look into the individual daily report too much. Nevertheless it gives a good picture about the differences people seem to be finding at the moment with the different traders. My accounts for instance haven’t been behaving as good as some others on this forum, just trying to figure out what the cause could be.&lt;u1 &gt;&lt;/u1 &gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;u1 &gt;&lt;/u1 &gt; Looking forward to see how &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will battle with all that's waiting to happen 2morrow too!&lt;u1 &gt;&lt;/u1 &gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Have fun everybody ;-)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Hendrick, I'm looking forward to reading your interview...haven't quite got to it yet. Also, interesting reading is your "risk challenge." You sound pretty confident! My results for the past two days are a little disconcerting. I had three consecutive losses. One trade was entered before the new updated version. It was on the usdjpy. The other two losses were eurusd &amp; usdcad both entered on 10/9. There was a profit for the gbpjpy entered on 10/9. See the attached statement for details. 1Trader2

One thing that I noticed is that running on DEMO accounts may not give a true indication of the performance of a particular EA due to the brokers switching off the demo feeds. Today in the morning I've noticed that 2 out of 3 brokers had "no connection" error message. Hard to tell how long they were "out" for but it doesn't give Phoenix the opportunity to have continuity like in the championship. Maybe have to switch to micro accounts and do tests live? At least that way you know that the price feed will not be switched off on you.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Anybody has good (or bad) experiences with MT4 brokers providing micro or mini accounts? I'd be looking to open up some accounts, preferably one in US and one in EU. Any suggestions? (apart from the obvious ones like FXDD, IBFX, Nueimex or SpaceVision). Maybe I should ask this question on a seperate thread?

8th report- North Finance demo on 12 pairs. Started on Sep 24. Balance - 12 209.70 Equity - 11 745.24 Results, graphic file and settings .doc attached. A few loses in past 2 days and negative Float has increased. This has to be expected as no EA that I have tested wins every day or every week. I'm demo trading 12 pairs and with win/loss ratio of ~4:1, I expect to see loses of ~4 to 5 in a row once in a while. Novices that just happened to start testing Phoenix this week, usually bail out at this point and complain that the EA is junk. With a win/loss ratio of ~4:1 , I'll use this EA everyday, anyday. I also believe that the win/loss ratio will even get better over time. As stated before, it is the long haul that determines how good an EA is. Today, wins are back, 3 in a row.

Hi Hendrick Prompt in what ranges of values it is necessary to spend optimization. Write in figures. On pair eurchf for last 6 months it is accomplished on backtest only 29 transactions. Means it is necessary to expand a time range for optimization to receive more than 100 transactions in backtest?

Hey saltcafe, I found a very handy thread HERE . Stockwet gives a good tutorial on how to access the different MT4 brokers' servers using just one program. This post on page two of the thread has many of the SRV files for both demo and live accounts for the various brokers. This can be very handy for easy access to several platforms for testing ea's, and may also give you an idea of who to open a mini account with. Incidentally, I'm running Phoenix on a demo right now with some decent results.

Here are the results for today.

Hi, Don't expand the time range. Six months should do to get 100 trades a nice Net Profit and a MD below 10%. A stated before back testing Phoenix is sometimes a hell of job. Will write a manual for this (if I have the time).

MIG statement (MT4 standard broker) as of 12 Oct 06. Starting equity $5000, current equity $4968. Forward testing pairs USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY, EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD with Pheonix_EA_v4_2_01. Appologies for not posting up statement of 11 Oct. Also please note I accedently closed down Metatrader today for a few hours. One thing to note in the statement is that GBPJPY trade is still running even though the target of 221.56 was clearly hit at around 7am GMT. There must have been execution problems at the time. The USDJPY unfortunately did get stopped out but P4 put in another sell order soon afterwards that hit the target within 11 hours . I will now switch to Pheonix_EA_v4_2_03 and use additionally to the above EURJPY, GBPUSD, GBPCHF, AUDUSD, EURCHF, EURAUD (basically all the pairs P4 has predefined settings for and the MIG broker supports).

After 1 week over 400 pip gain (conservative approximation) in the live account based on equity. This weekend I want to figure out exact pip gains. The Alpari demo also looks very good. New settings were added to all three accounts today.

Phoenix 4.2 forward test on IBFX. Starting ballance $3000 current Equity $ 3 025.21

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi, I get a lot of e-mails concerning the predefined settings. Will try to explain this further in the weekend.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Ok, &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt; is not a bad EA. Look at your statements and &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is still in the top 10 of the Contest. So it has some kind of potential. However what I don’t like is that some trades are in contradiction to each other. It don’t take currency correlation in account (if you don’t know what currency correlation means, just Google it). So I want to build a correlation function in &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and this is the idea behind it:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; There are 2 pairs that are far more profitable than the others: GBPJPY and USDJPY. What I want to do is to make a special (test) version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, Phoenix Account Booster (I don’t like small gains, I want my account to increase substantially within 1 year) that’s taken the following currency correlation in account:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; SELL - GBPJPY will means:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; BUY EURCHF, SELL CHFJPY and BUY EURGBP at the same time&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; BUY GBPJPY :&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Sell EURCHF, BUY CHFJPY and SELL EURGBP&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; BUY USDJPY:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; SELL EURUSD, SELL GBPUSD, BUY USDCHF&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Sell USDJPY:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; BUY EURUSD, BUY GBPUSD, SELL USDCHF&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; The only thing you have to do is to attach PhoenixAccountBooster to the charts GBPJPY and USDJPY and the EA will do the rest. Is it risky? Yes of course. If one trade goes against you, all the other trades will do the same. So we have to find a way to keep this risk between acceptable borders. First is the performance until now of the GBPJPY and the USDJPY with &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. According to this performance you may expect more profitable trades than loosing trades form these pairs. Furthermore I will try to find new settings for a SL, TP ratio of 1:2 (it’s now 2:1). &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Problem is that you can’t backward test “correlation EA’s”, so I have to forward test it on a demo-account. I will post this special version in the weekend. So if you have some space to test another EA the please be my guest!!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Please give me some feedback about this!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Harry: This has always been a concern of mine when running the same EA on several pairs, some of which are 'related'. If one of those pairs is a loser then the other one is destined to be as well. If one is a winner, then the other is a winner. But, since the SL is 2x the TP then...you know. Either way, glad you thought about this. I was thinking about just running P4 on a select few pairs to see how things work out but since I'm tracking each pair individually in an Excel spreadsheet I'm sort of already doing that. For the week, there have been 9 closed trades, not sure how P4 was affected by the retail sales release this morning, there were several positions open, but I'll figure that out when I get to the house. I'll post what I have tomorrow morning. I've got a hot date with my girlie tonight...yup, same one I cooked dinner for a few weeks back. I think it was the stawberries ;-)

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Oh yeah...The account history tab shows the closed P4 trades as Phoenix3 or something like that....Can you re-name that character string to read as 'something else' so we can keep track of which EA is doing what...aye... yo

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hey Palmer, I think you should really show your "secret recipy" to the world! Will make a lot of men happy!! Concerning the string "Phoenix v3", I've changed this in the lastest version (some post before).

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I'm not sure about everyone else's results, but mine have been very promising for this week. I have enough confidence in this badboy to turn up the risk to 3 lots per trade instead of just one for next week. Hendrick, thanks for all your work, it's definitely paying off (literally)!

Interesting new development Hendrick. Looks like a good idea to me. Just keeps getting better and better. Cheers! Here are some more results in the forward test.

Phoenix 4.2 forward test on IBFX. Starting ballance $3000 current Equity $ 3 046.96 BTW Contest Phoenix made 4 trades this week for a total of ~$4500.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Seems like northfinance and ibfx are the brokers with consistent profit with phoenix &gt;&gt;&gt; anyone doing phoenix on a real acct and not been harrassed by your broker for making a profit? Joules

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi Hendrick, I don't really understand why you need to do this - can't you just increase the lot size for the GBPJPY or USDJPY trades? But I do agree in terms of other trades. Often you see conflicting trades on P4. My current statement is long EURJPY short GBPJPY and long GBPCHF short GBPUSD! Anyway, here's the MIG statement (MT4 standard broker ) as of end of week (13 Oct 06). Starting equity $5000, current equity $5172. Was a good day on Friday, many trades hit target but one just stopped out. Forward testing pairs USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY, EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, EURJPY, GBPUSD, GBPCHF, AUDUSD, EURCHF, EURAUD with Pheonix_EA_v4_2_03. I like this system all in all. If anything its quite fun to watch

--- 帖子 #168 ---
This time little bit later. Results are pretty good. Actualy best for EA I have ever seen. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thanks Mun. Let's see what next week will bring us.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Looking good Snoopy. In my opinion IBFX and NEXXT are the best brokers for forward testing EA's on demo-accounts because it seems that there's not much difference between their demo- and live-feed. Keep us posted Snoopy!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I can judge only IBFX. Trading demo and live looks almost same (comparing data feed not psychology J )&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; However trading news on live is much different. IBFX use wild spread. Also execution is not always perfect. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I dont complain. It’s just fact you have to live with it or leave. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I can see from my log that no trading was made during news release. So this shouldn’t affect Phoenix performance on live account. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I am seriously thinging about testing on live.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; However thanks for your hard work and the outstanding effort you are giving to this project. It’s motivating.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; -snoopy&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I've use IBFX and FXDD for forward testing my EA's and FXDD doesnt have the wild spreads during the news, in fact they rarely change the spread more than 2-3 pips. In forward testing, I had great results with them using several EA's and execution has never been a problem. I am forward testing P4 on USD/JPY and EUR/USD for the past week with a small profit using the default settings but I haven't had the EA running all the time so my results are not quite accurate. I'm sure that FXDD does way more volume than IBFX, and it it seems like IBFX's range is usually wider than FXDD, a hint that SL's and TP's are being taken out by the desk, although I can never prove it. I've used North Finance as well for manual trading and execution is nowhere near as good as FXDD. Keep it up Hendrick and P4, you're only 1 spot away in the from the money!!! Also, GREAT interview!

Let’s talk once again about Forex and &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and what you expect from these two. There are some Forex “gurus” out there that will tell you that it’s not possible to make a fortune out of Forex in a short time. Well, if all of these “gurus” are telling the same story over and over and over again, you will believe it in the end. But I don’t!! You can call me priggish (and believe me, a lot of people do!), but I don’t believe these “gurus” and I will follow my own way to achieve my goal: make a lot of money from Forex in a short time. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Let’s be honest, &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; has some potential. For those who tested &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;, see your statements and above that &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is still in the top ten of the Contest (out of 260 EA’s). The question now is, are you going for the small gains or will you go for the big money!!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is free and will stay free for as long as I live. I had several e-mails telling me that I could easily sell the concept of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. But I won’t! Why? Because I believe in sharing. And that’s it! Do what ever you like with &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, but it’s my hope that some of you will share a part of their profits with those people in the world that are not so fortunate. And that’s in short my goal: a better live for yourself without financial problems and a part of your wealth for those who are not so fortunate. It’s your choice.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Phoenix Booster is a first trial to increase your account substantially in a short time. This version is very basic. As you know you can’t backward test correlation EA’s with the Strategy Tester. I did some changes to give me some rough idea about its performance in the past. See attachment.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; You can add Phoenix Booster to your existing demo-account (I’ve changed the MagicNumber so there should be no conflicts) or you can open a new demo-account for this (my advice). &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Let’s work all together to make &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; the best EA we have ever seen!!! Add Phoenix Booster to the following (M15) charts: USDJPY and GBPJPY. The EA will do the rest (Currency Correlation) &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

You are one of a kind my friend. Thanks Hendrick I will test Phoenix booster this week. I'll be back with the results.

Thank you Hendrick Are the settings for Booster the same as version 4.2.2? That is to say should we enter the same settings into the booster? Regards

Wackena

--- 帖子 #178 ---
In backtest on IBFX mini, just as a test, I set Risk at 2 (200%) to have 6 lots at start on a $3,000 deposit. On a 6 months test, it ran past allowable lot size of 50 for a mini account and stopped trading. I put a 50 lot limiter in the code and then it kept on placing 50 lots order till the test end. Since most mini accounts only allow max balance of $10,000, a 50 lot size limit may not be needed. But, just in case for the long run, you may want to consider adding coded 100 lot size limiter for standard accounts. If you had run a 7 months backtest on PBv2.0, you would had see this same situation. It might also be a little early to be worried about this. The backtest result was $62,479. Not bad for a Mini. Wackena

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi Wackena! Only the USDJPY and the GBPJPY for the Booster.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
For the Booster use PrefSettings=true and MM=true. The EA will do the rest!!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Can you show the change of code you want?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Inserted Code //---- return lot size if(lot&lt;0.1) lot=0.1; if(MM==false) lot=Lots; if(AccountIsMicro==true) lot=lot/10; [color=red]if(lot&gt;100)lot=100;[/color] return(lot); } Wackena

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Wackena I noticed your testing with an IBFX mini account. Look at my trades for 09/27/06 and 10/12/06 below. Is this caused by the 'lot&lt;0.1' line or something else? It may have something to do with the way lots are entered in the IBFX mini 1.0 = 10k or I may just have a backtesting error I created somehow. Could you run a back test with Phoenix Booster from Sept 1st to yesterday and see if you get the same thing? USDJPY $1000 mini account risk=3.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi Hendrick, the last day's test told me that it's really worth taking a closer look at Phoenix . So I did. and btw, I always wanted to ask you a question about your CheckForClose() function. So here it is: What is that suppost to mean? if(....) continue; -&gt; alright, that's clear. However, why do you have a '{' then? What does that { belong to, to the if()? But then you would have to put the { right after the if(), right? Maybe I got you wrong there. And, I know, right now we don't use this part of code. However, since I am a programer too, my goal is it to keep Phoenix clean of unnecessary / wrong code and bugs. I still wonder why nobody is putting real money into Phoenix. Are putting in real money, Hendrick? I will do that in a few weeks, I think. Only that my funds are really limited. :/ We will change that! Thanks for Phoenix, Hendrick!&lt;/orderstotal();i++)&gt;

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi Tradeigel! You're absolutly right! Will change this for the next update of Phoenix. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
All the inputs such as target stop osmafast slow etc are showing zero, is this the way it should be and does it work as it is ? PrefSettings and MM are already = true

--- 帖子 #187 ---
nvwine, Attqched is PB-v2.0. This is IBFX mini backtest to emulate your test. It produced similar lost $-370, but with only 14 trades compared to youir 22 trades. DD% was different also. Also attached is PB-v2.0-FXDD (loss $-572 &amp; lot=0.3) for same time range as above and PB-v2.0-IBFX-6months (profit $ 56,928). If you look at 6 months backtest, you will see that the last 2 months (same test range as previous tests) was not a good profit gain period. Wackena

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I just ran another IBFX mini backtest for same time range after optimizing the Fast_Price &amp; Slow_Price variables. Now the results have profit $ 631. The file is PB-v2.0-optimised. But the 6 months backtest with optimised setting change did much worse. Only $1,330 profit compare to $ 56,928 with original setting. Wackena

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Phoenix Booster v2 contains a serious error, Don't use this version. The right version will follow later today. Thanks Herbert for pointing out this error!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
If you want to do a forward test then use PrefSettings=true and MM=true.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Wackena, thanks for your help. It is nice to verify my backtest data. I had planned to show some backtests and give some opinions but in light of Hendrick's post #189 I'll wait and re-test his new version of the Booster EA. Hendrick, thanks for your hard work. I'll be waiting for the revised version of Phoenix Booster. In the PDF file below are my results for 6 trading days. The closed trades accounted for a 721 positive pip gain. The float was an aprox. 165 negative pip loss. So the 6 day average daily pip gain, based on equity, was over 90 pips a day. Very Good! The first few of days of this week I may not post any results. My tests will still be running. There is a money and investing show in San Francisco and I'll go down daily to learn something maybe or at least waste time. My main reason is the free wine and cheese events and the free cocktail receptions the first couple of evenings. It is great what investment houses will do to try to attract your business. I hope they never hear that my numerous accounts are funded with a few hundred dollars each. I think that EAs run much better with the least possible interruptions especially Phoenix. From what I have observed it takes quite a few days for the trades to start reflecting each other in two backtests that were started only a couple of days apart. Because of this I am planning to move my live and some of my test accounts to a virtual private server this week to see if it makes the results more consistent.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi Nvwine (now I understand this "wine" in your name!) Hope your stay in San Francisco may be usefull! (Why is it that so many members of Forex forums are wine lovers?)

Phoenix Booster is just an experiment to play with. It's not my intention to drastically change the concept of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 because this version is now a stable and reliable Expert Advisor that could be profitable on the long run. So let's keep it this way (apart from some fine-tuning of the settings).&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; But now Booster. Booster is based on currency correlation (Google “forex correlation if you don’t know what I mean). There are two pairs that are doing very well with &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; 4.2: the USDJPY and GBPJPY. According to currency correlation the pairs that are correlated to these two are going in the same direction or just the opposite. So if the USDJPY and the GBPJPY are profitable so will be the correlated pairs. Look at the code what this mean.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I’ve used to opportunity to test another aspect, the TP and SL ratio. As you know &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; uses a TP of 42 and a SL of 84. Some of you don’t like this. So I will use Booster to test other ratios at the same time: the USDJPY uses a TP of 42 and a SL of 21 and the GBPJPY a TP of 44 and a SL &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="0f"&gt;0f&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; 44. Maybe the results of forward testing Phoenix Booster can help us to improve the performance of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; How to use Phoenix Booster 2.1:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; You have to open the charts of USDJPY and GBPJPY and attach Phoenix Booster to it. Don’t change the settings for now! I’m using it on a separate demo-account because Booster is highly experimental and I don’t want to disturb my &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; 4.2 account.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Expert Advisors based on correlation can only be fully tested through forward testing. So it could be full of bugs! Be aware of that. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Last remark: Booster is only an experiment. Feel free to test it but don’t use it’s settings for &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Attached are my test results of Phoenix 4.2. Since I had to shot my demo account down due to some technical improvements at the brokerage, I attached the results of my whole test period. Strange: My results are not as good as other posters' ones here.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
My advice: open a demo-account with one of the brokers that have almost no differences between data feed between demo and live accounts. Try http://neuimex.com/ for example. Let me know if your results will improve!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Thanks for that one. I just signed up with them as well now. Almost start to feel sorry for my pc... ;-) Got about 9 MT4's running @ the moment on 4 different traders :-) Just trying to figure out which one is most reliable for me. Thanks for your Booster too off course! Set up for forward testing next week. Cheers!

Hi Vince! Hope you've got your flu under control now! Well, that’s a lot of demo's you've running at the same time (have your Core 2 Duo already arrived?). Looking forward to your test results!!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #198 ---
well...what do you mean? D'you mean just a computer in you house which is only running the EAs?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Well... it is the least I can do to help! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Been fighting the flu and I won ;-) Thanks for asking. Finally get to go flying again 2morrow. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Dual core has arrived at last! Just finished installing Windows and I'm very impressed indeed! Ran a test for a period of a year (just for the purpose of this test) and with accurate data (so 90%)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 1) P4 3 GHz: 50sec 2) AMD Athlon 64 x2 4800: 23 sec!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; That's more then twice as fast :-) Can't wait to run some optimizing tests, just to see if this will be 2 times faster too. (Note: not sure if the 'fresh' installation had a big effect in the differences but still..) Vince&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Oh, I see what you mean...

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Nobody have the template of Phoenix System. I want to see it in the chart. Thanks. coyan

--- 帖子 #202 ---
When you guys are running more than one system with one broker, are you having to open a new account with each system? I assume that each account will run live in the background? BTW my forward test of booster will start a market open. Thanks to all. Kevin

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Although, I do need to log on to each account to view details but I just assume they are running live in the background.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
do even try to watch the system...That's not worth it. That's why there's no template. The system uses "hidden patterns", patterns which are not visible for the human eye.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
You can run multiple systems with one broker and one account with that broker. Just be sure that the smiley face in the upper right corner is there in EVERY system chart!

--- 帖子 #206 ---
But the thing with that to remeber is that if you're going to run multi system under one account is that you will need to decifer the different trade's activity from the detailed chart which could get confusing and you could easily draw down a major portion of a 5000.00 account due to several systems sucking down on that 5000.00. So I think what I'll need is to place the platform from one broker into a seperate folder for each system I run. 'Cause if I have each system on a new account then when I log on to a different account, it will cause the previous to stop running. I think I have figured out. Thanks! Kevin

--- 帖子 #207 ---
That's pretty much how I do it too. Just COPY your existing MT4 folder from your Program Files to a temporary place on your hard drive. Rename it to for instance "MT4 - 02" (without the " of course..). Copy this folder back into your program files. All you need to do is make a shortcut to the "terminal.exe" file for easy access. After opening this "02" version you can create a new account and set up the charts again as you did before. Good luck&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Phoenix Booster opened it's first orders. It only opened 3 orders. Should it open 4 orders? This was at 4:00 GMT in an IBFX mini demo account. The attached text file has the log file from the experts\log directory as well as the info under the experts tab and the journal tab in the terminal window. Did anyone else have orders open for only 3 pairs?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Ooops!! Yes these are errors. Will change them as soon as possible.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Yes, I got three orders too on IBFX mini. The missing one is CHF/JPY which is not available from IBFX mini account. This pair is available from FXDD, NF, etc. Thanks! forex4syg

There's a bug in Phoenix Booster. Version 2.2 is the fixed version.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Thanks for your reply. There is some reason why we are getting only 3 orders. I'm not smart enough to know why. CHF/JPY is available on my IBFX platform. Have you tried 'right mouse clicking' in the Market Watch Window and choosing 'select all' from the mouse right click menu? I included a picture of my pairs in the zip file below. Yours should be the same.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hendrick, Once again I'm not sure if this is a problem. Is Booster only supposed to take a trade on one pair at a time? Since Booster took the 3 trades shown in post #210 the EA no longer goes through the 'signals' and the 'buy and sell conditions' part of the code. Before it took the 3 positions I had the information shown in the zip file below when I looked at the experts tab. Now I get no information even with the new version. This makes me think that now that it opened a trade it is now skipping this whole area of the code. I added some testing info to your code along with a couple of bool operators at the top on a temporary basis because I like to see what is happening. You can see it below at the bottom of the text file in the zip file. I realize it may be ugly but it is the best I can do. As I said above now I get nothing. Looks like this for 60 minutes. Look in the zip file for how it used to update before booster opened 3 out of 4? trades.

Greetings all! I am trading on an IBFX mini/mico account (i.e. where 1 lot = 10,000 and .1 lot=1,000), and would like to use micro lots (i.e. .1 lots=1,000) to avoid the problem of assymetrical leverage. Will setting the accountismicro variable to YES and MM = TRUE accomplish this, or must other changes be made within the code. All the best, Michael

Hi Harry, I thought that you had posted a new version of the plain vanila Phoenix but can't find it in the thread? In which post is the latest Phoenix? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I've been thinking about looking at ways of optimizing &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:city w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:city&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; and have thought of something different. Nearly all trades that &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:city w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:city&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; takes always take a loss initially. That is to be expected and I don't have a problem with that at all. However what may be of value is to optimize the orders being placed to take advantage of this. For example currently phoenix at the time a signal is generated, would take a buy order at 1.2600 and set TP @ 1.2640 and SL of 1.2520. Roughly a 1:2 ratio, and I've been thinking about reducing this ratio to roughly 1:1. (up to 80 pips loss for a possible 40 pips gain) So a new proposal would be at 1.2600 (when the signal is generated) place a limit order to buy at 1.2580 with a TP of 1.2640 and SL 1.2520. This gives us a 1:1 ratio for the trade. (up to 60 pips loss for a 60 pips gain) Now this gives us a couple of things: a) we have reduced the level of loss, (80 pips down to 60 pips) therefore for the same order, without increasing the risk profile at all, we can actually take a larger position b) also if the trades do play out as expected then we increase the profit factor (due to larger amount of pips gained and larger position size) c) however, we increase the risk that a trade won't be taken at all, because our new order limit levels may not be reached so we may miss out on the profitable 40 pips What do you think? Does this sound like a good avenue to pursue for this EA?&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

comrades, i'm pretty new here and trying to learn the ins and outs of expert advisors i seem to have managed to get the phoenix ea running using the metatrader 15 min historic data as suggested but when i run phoenix on the old data it tells me i run out of money am i doing something wrong or does phoenix fail to profit using last two years of data?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi Hendrick, &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;You mentioned that optimizing of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is not easy job. It looks so with so many parameters. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;I am not a programmer guru at all. Also I am pretty busy during day. But if there is something I can do, it is performing back tests on my home computer.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Feel free to send us/me any range of settings you would like to test and we can help you with that peace of work.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;-snoopy&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Hmmm, I had a position closed out with the first release of PBooster on the GBPJPY for about $250. Would the new version of PBooster entered and exited this trade at the same rate? Just wondering if I should count this one in the forward testing.

I had the same trade happen. Still trying to figure it out. I've still not loaded the newest since the last bug.

A short recap on &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; 4.2 and Phoenix Booster.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; After testing for several weeks I came to the conclusion that &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 is making more profitable than losing trades. So, on the long run it should be profitable after all. Only problem is that the SL of 84 (TP:SL is 1:2) has a too great impact on your account. First I thought it was impossible to find a better TP/SL ratio, but I’ve changed my mind. The good news is, that there are better TP/SL ratios. I’m now testing several ratios (give me some time, because there’s more than &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; in my life: family, work etc.). I think with these ratios the performance of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will improve substantially. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; Booster&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I have high hopes for Booster! It’s functioning now but only half. As soon as trades are placed for the base currency and its correlated currencies the other base and correlated currencies don’t trade. I know why and will fix this as soon as possible. I will make a new version were we can all test are own base and correlated currencies. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; But now I need your help: if all the regular visitors of this forum will be so kind to search the internet for “currency correlation” and try to give groups of currencies that are strongly correlated to each other and post these in this forum. I really would appreciate this!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is on the right track. It only needs to be improved. If we work all together then I’m sure we will succeed at last! Come on, there’s work to do!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hendrick, wouldn't it make sense to add this to the code of Phoenix &amp; P.Booster: right in the beginning: #define version &lt;PUT HERE THE VERSION NUMBER (like v2.2)&gt; string EAComment="Phoenix "+version; and in each Order*()-function put only EAComment as comment for the order. This way we can keep track of which version opened / closed positions. I like that so I always have to add it to each version

Hi Saltcafe, I really appreciate your contributions to this thread. Great stuff and very helpfull!! But I don't agree with this proposal. It will highly change the concept of Phoenix (Phoenix is a counter-trend EA and not a trend follower). I agree about your opnion to reduce the level of loss. But I think there are other solutions for that (read my previous post about changing the SL:TP ratios)

I know this is meant to be an EA, but is there anyone who would be willing to turn this into an indicator since my account is with someone who doesn't use MT4, but I have the access to my computer 24/6 so I can still get into trades rather easily? I can finish up writing in the piece of code to have it SMS you with which currency pair, entry, exit, s/l so you can try and get in whenever you can, but I need someone else with a bit more coding experience to get me started? If anyone wants to take this on, I would appreciate it. After it's all started, I wouldn't mind keeping the indicator version up to date with the EA version for those interested (I can modify code, I'm just not so good at creating it out of nothing).

Phoenix is kicking butt at the EA championships! #2 right now. Great job Hendrick! http://championship.mql4.com/2006/participants

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Well...to curreny correlation: Maybe it's an idea to read out current currency correlation and then let Booster act accordingly. to today's performance: It's just AWESOME!! Opened 8 trades, 4 opened by Booster, 4 by regular Phoenix. Only 1 (!) was closed in loss the other 7 (!) went into profit! That's pretty much like a moneyMakingMachine , only wish it was live acc. - will probably do that pretty soon. Thanks for Phoenix, Hendrick.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hendrick, Another link. This has method below on how to calculate correlation. http://www.investopedia.com/articles.../05/051905.asp Here is the correlation-calculation process reviewed step by step: &lt;LI nd="12"&gt;Get the pricing data for your two currency pairs; say they are GBP/USD and USD/JPY &lt;LI nd="13"&gt;Make two individual columns, each labeled with one of these pairs. Then fill in the columns with the past daily prices that occurred for each pair over the time period you are analyzing &lt;LI nd="14"&gt;At the bottom of the one of the columns, in an empty slot, type in =CORREL( &lt;LI nd="15"&gt;Highlight all of the data in one of the pricing columns; you should get a range of cells in the formula box. Type in comma Repeat steps 3-5 for the other currency Close the formula so that it looks like =CORREL(A1:A50,B1:B50) The number that is produced represents the correlation between the two currency pairs Most articles I have read states that currency correlations are dynamic and always changing in some degree over time. Can EA be linked, via a script to price history file? Then current correlations could be calculated and EA could adjust order trigger routines accordingly. Wackena

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi Hendrick, I'm not quite sure why you got the idea about my suggestion trying to change the nature of the EA (from counter-trend to trend following). That certainly isn't the idea behind what I am suggesting. I suspect that it must have been my clumsy way of explaining what I wanted to propose. Anyway, if you wish I may try to explain this in a different way if you wish. BTW. I couldn't find your post about the mods to the SL:TP ratios that you mentioned. Do you recall what number it was?

Sorry guys - MIG account crapped out. Can't seem to login to it anymore. Useless. I've just now started Phoenix_EA_v4_2_03 on a new North Finance demo account, $5000 initial capital. When Pheonix Booster v3 comes out I will start forward testing that on a new demo account (probably Neuimex or IBFX)

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi Hendrick and thanks for clarification, as to Phoenix v4_2, whenever you post new settings should the "PrefSettings" changed from true to false? What I have done is that I had entered all your new settings manually but the PrefSettings is still on true, does this means that the EA is still running on the initial settings or do the new settings manually entered take effect? Thanks in advance for your reply Haward PS: If anybody else knows the answer to this question, I would appreciate it

--- 帖子 #249 ---
hey howard, generally use PrefSetting=TRUE and paste the new PrefSettings into the code as you did. If Hendrick submits a PhoenixVERSION.mq4 in addition to the settingsFile, use that instead - it has the new settigs already, although it's also attached as txt-file. BTW, the PrefSetting-setting indicates if Phoenix takes this part called "Preffered Settings" (the one you copied into Phoenix.mq4, I guess) into consideration. If you set PrefSettings to FALSE Phoenix takes the values you enter manually when you activate the Expert on a chart.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
till now (test started this week) I have each 4 trades one loss, and this happened twice. That is: 4 wins, 1 loss, 4 wins again, and 1 loss. I am using Phoenix &amp; PB. IMPORTANT: the 2 losses were both (!) GBPUSD trades, only one win was GBPUSD (opened by Phoenix Booster)! I think Hendrick did NOT recommend GBPUSD for Phoenix (although he's using it in PB). Hendrick: why are you using GBPUSD for Phoenix and not recommending it for Phoenix? I mean, till now you were RIGHT. One GBPUSD of PB positive, 2 of Phoenix negative. You are doing it because there's a correlation between GBPJPY/USDJPY and GBPUSD, right? I am really excited about Phoenix Booster! Maybe we can use it without Phoenix if it contiues working like this.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
The reasons for the Booster experiment are twofold: first to find out if different ratios of SL and TP would work and second to learn more about Currencies Correlation. Well, I don't know about your results with Booster, but those of mine were not very promising. It also makes no sense in my opinion to open four trades that are correlated: they could go all against you so to me this looks more like gambling.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; For the time being I will concentrate on the further development of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 and put Booster on the shelf (unless you guys have ideas how to improve it).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Nevertheless I think the concept of currency correlation can be used in &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2. This is my idea: if there's a BUY/SELL signal for a pair, the EA will first check if there any open trades for pairs that have a strong correlation with the pair where you get the signal for. If so the signal is not valid. Another option is to look how the open correlated trade is doing: is it loosing or is it in profit. Based on that a decision can be made to open the new trade or not.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Let' stick for the moment to the first option: don't trade if a strongly correlated trade is open. For those of you, who had tested &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; for a longer time: in your Account History you can see if this makes sense or not. I would be most grateful if some of you could check this and report it back to this forum.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; You can use this summary. First column is the pair where you get BUY/SELL signal for and the second column are the pairs that are strongly correlated to the first pair. So if you get a BUY/SELL signal for the EURUSD and there is an open trade for the USDCHF or USDCAD then the signal is not valid:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; EURUSD USDCHF, USDCAD&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; USDJPY GBPUSD, EURCHF, GBPJPY&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; USDCHF EURUSD, GBPJPY&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; USDCAD EURUSD&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; AUDUSD GBPUSD&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; EURJPY GBPUSD, EURCHF&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; GBPUSD USDJPY, EURCHF, GBPJPY&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; EURCHF USDJPY, GBPUSD, EURJPY, GBPJPY&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; CHFJPY EURCHF&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; EURGBP EURJPY &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

I have dabbled in the Forex before strictly with demo accounts. I came across the Phoenix thread a few days ago. For the past couple of days I have learned Meta 4 and the back testing procedure. I have followed Hendrick's procedure for a 90% modelling quality, etc. I AM AMAZED!!! Thanks A LOT Hendrick !!!! I guess I am like everybody else when I ask: Is there any reason why this system, if tweaked with the times, cannot produce month in and month out profits? Over the next couple of months I am going to try and learn what each parameter means (give a man to fish, teach a man to fish type thing). Please keep up with the thread! Thanks again and good luck with the competition. Your interview was very interesting! "It's not where your at, but where your coming from"

athalon7: "Is there any reason why this system, if tweaked with the times, cannot produce month in and month out profits?" That's what this journey is all about. Finding the best ingredients to make the soup with. I had three winners in a row last night. I was going to rpost the PL graph but the image is too large. I'll repost when I get home. Hendrick: I guess we'll be P4'ing for a while. And, yes. If you can figure out a way to filter the correlelated pairs I believe that is a great idea. The only issue I see is that if people want to test this option, they must run P4 on all of the pairs, not just a few. Unless, you have a CorrelateOn or CorrelateOff option. Ya know what I'm getting at??? Back to the battle at hand!!!

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Yes Sir! It looks like a six month proposition. When running the tests the account decreases at times but always increases at a larger rate so patience is key. Here is my question: Can anyone, especially Hendrick, give me the optimized numbers for the USD/JPY in the time frame 4/2005 to 10/2005? This will show us the differece the numbers made from last year to this one and what numbers changed. I will be very interested in these. Thanks much.

wow..bad day for Phoenix Well...actually, not _that_ bad. If I hadn't used GBPUSD and PB then there was just one bad trade. Hm..But PB is not performing bad. But it's probably not a good concept to base the decisions just on 2 currency pairs (bad diversification for example).

--- 帖子 #262 ---
hey Hendrick, did you have a bad day for Pv4.2, too? Can you see a correlation between news days (like today) and bad days for Phoenix? What do you think about my suggestion made a few past ago (with changing the CommentCode in P4)? Are you testing on live or only on demo? What about the other pairs than the 4 you mentioned earlier, you said "the optimal setting will be discovered", what does that mean? Do they perform badly? Do you think Pv4.2 is ready for going live at least on GBPJPY and USDJPY (of course only with a little money) ? I know, that's a lot of questions. Take you time, but please answer them all. I don't like asking the same question twice , it's making the thread bigger, too.

Hi Hendrick, Many thanks for sharing with us your Phoenix EA. It is great and I wish you all the best for the Automated Trading Championship 2006. As I looked into the code to try to find out it's "magic formla", I was not sure if the divergence function was coded as originally intended : I refering to the following part " dv2 = ((maF1 - maS1) - (maF2 - maS2)); //---- return(dv1 - dv2);" I would guess it was intended as : " dv2 = maF2 - maS2; //---- return(dv1 - dv2);" Sorry in advance, if this topic as already been addressed in this thread, I just didn't managed to find the it.

1trader2: I don't know either. But, I'd be willing to put money on the fact that after so many months running P4 that all of the equity/PL graphs would look similar. Not exact but should show the same general trend. P4 taking it in the cornhole right now on 8 positions....

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Here is the profit factor/net profit totals for 5 popular currencies. Hendrick says we should look every two weeks to see if tweeking is necessary, so I based the numbers on two week differentials. I could not Upload the spreadsheet as .xls files are not permitted. Now the questions: how much does it have to drop before a tweak is necessary and where do we start with the tweaking? I noticed that the the GBP/USD is the only currency that has the OSMA Fast number higher than the OSMA Slow for what it is worth. Hang in there on the trades. This is a marathon, not a sprint. Easy to say, hard to do I know, but the backtesting proves that bad trades will be made. If this wasn't the case there wouldn't be a market.

Not too sure why you guys are getting bad results. My P4_2_03 did pretty damn well. Some trades its struggling on but total floating P/L is positive. At the moment I'm not using this to put trades down on a real account but if I am about to open a position in one direction and P4 opens a position in the other direction, I think twice about it Anyway, North Finance statement as of 18 Oct 06. Starting equity $5000, current equity $5380 (7.6% in 24 hours!! woooo!!). Forward testing pairs USDCHF, GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, USDCAD, EURGBP, EURCHF, EURJPY, GBPJPY, GBPCHF, EURAUD with Pheonix_EA_v4_2_03 on M30 charts.

mind to show us your settings ? i have set risk to 0.2, its just struggling to rise the equity after few days running

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Well..the settings are not too important since P4 is setting them itself anyway. BUT: you're using it on M30! That's the difference. Hendrick runs P4 on M15! BTW, for me it's a boring day till now only 2 closed trades but both by PB.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
i've got 6 open, -80 pips floating, 3 winner 3 loser, hendrick run on M15 ? so do i, should i consider this ea winning ?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Is that my buddy chad there chiming in? Hope your tradding has been treating you well. Mun, that's a nice looking equity graph...hmmm. Curious as to why the different brokers have such different results....Can the spreads /quote feeds/I hate to think indicator calculations be that different?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
ahh this is very interesting! I thought P4 was meant to be run on M30 and PB on M15. Currently I'm not running PB because it is buggy. Will wait for v3 before testing it. Yes the settings I am using for P4 are unchanged. Just dragged + dropped them on the charts and it starting making money . Its an exciting day here - equity currently up to $5460.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
wait, P4_2_03 ?? oh, i'm using p4_2_02...Anyway is there really so much difference between the 2 version, v3 is making 7% first day while mine is flat...... unbelievable. Palmers, they are treating me well, thanks. Chad,

Hi. First of all, English is not my mother tongue so, sorry for mistakes i will do. I'm one those tousands peoples who read this forum without never post anything :-) but great respect to brilliant brains who made these EA possible. I'm testing Phoenix since the early first post. (before this treat.). I've got a question : Is it possible to add an option called "CapitalProtection". Eg : when Phoenix made, for example, 100% of profit, and "CapitalProtection" is ON then the EA do not use no more the initial capital. If the percent sould also a variable it's should be welcome too. What do you thing about ? Thanks. ManAtWorkAtForex. (MAWAF)

Hey Palmer! Backward testing Correlation EA's is not possible due to the restrictions of MT4's Strategy Tester. I'm not sure if I understood your last question right. If you're going to forward test a Correlation EA then it's not necessary to open charts for every pair. Through the function MarketInfo you can open trades for other pairs than the one you have attached the EA to.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Indeed a lot of questions!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Yesterday was a bad day for &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, but today it all went in the right direction!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Your change with the CommentCode is on my list for the next version.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The question if I'm testing live or demo is private. So I'm not giving you an answer to that.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Finding the optimal settings for a pair is very time consuming. But I think I will find them all in the end. No doubt about that!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; GBPJPY and USDJPY: if you want to use them to go live is all up to you. Consult your own forward testing results and those from others. I think you now the answer.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #281 ---

Hi Olivier, As far as I understood there are indeed two versions of Diverge. When I have the time I will test both versions on Phoenix. Although I don't think it will make a lot of difference. Thanks Olivier for this contribution.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Athalon, this summary is really useful. Thanks. Well, the question when we have to tweak the settings again is a difficult one. Personally I think we have to tweak again when we have three consecutive losses. From all the backward tests I made I've never seen more than 2 consecutive losses. Maybe I will build a new function in the next &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; that will stop placing trades after 3 consecutive losses.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I would be very grateful if some of you can make the next summary:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Look at your Account History and look for every trade at its opening and closing time. Is there some kind of correlation between the total time a trade is open and if it's profitable or not? I've not analysed my own Account History but it seems to me that the longer a trade is open the less chance it will be profitable.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; So, for those who have an Account History of 2 weeks or more and if you have the time can you please make such a summary. It would really help me!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Harry: OK, I was thinking about the logic wrong. But yes, it would have to be forward tested, not backtested. Without logic there is no reason...

Hendrick, I have been trading Phoenix since 9/4/06, updating versions as you post them. Have had 63 total trades, 51 profitable, 12 losses. Days to loss as follows: Open Close Days Pair 9/15 9/15 &lt;1 usdjpy 9/25 9/26 1 eurjpy 9/26 9/27 1 usdjpy 9/27 9/28 1 eurjpy 9/27 9/29 2 usd/jpy 10/6 10/6 &lt;7 hrs usd/jpy 10/6 10/9 3 gbp/jpy 10/9 10/10 1 usd/cad 10/9 10/11 2 eur/usd 10/6 10/11 5 usd/jpy 10/9 10/16 7 eur/jpy 10/17 10/17 &lt;5 hrs gbp/jpy My observation does not substantiate what you suspected. What I see is 80% of the losses are in the JPY pairs. 10 of the losing pairs were attributed to JPY. Total loss from these pairs was: $1730-776 pips. However 30 of the 51 profitable trades (59%) were in the JPY pairs. I use FXDD and trade the 8 pairs you recommended, half of which are the JPY pairs. Any recommendations? 1Trader2

Gotta break up the routine here with a 'diversion' every once in a while...more to come I assure you.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Great! Just what I needed. Thanks

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hendrick- Have you persued a "dynamic stop"? See the enclosed Bitmap, it should be self explanatory.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Hendrick, Well no, what I was trying to gently say is : I think there is a bug in the divergence function of Phoenix_EA_v4_2_03.mq4 (which give great result BTW) As it is today in P4 : "double divergence(int F_Period, int S_Period, int F_Price, int S_Price, int mypos) { int i; //---- double maF1, maF2, maS1, maS2; double dv1, dv2; //---- maF1 = iMA(Symbol(), 0, F_Period, 0, MODE_SMA, F_Price, mypos); maS1 = iMA(Symbol(), 0, S_Period, 0, MODE_SMA, S_Price, mypos); dv1 = (maF1 - maS1); maF2 = iMA(Symbol(), 0, F_Period, 0, MODE_SMA, F_Price, mypos + 1); maS2 = iMA(Symbol(), 0, S_Period, 0, MODE_SMA, S_Price, mypos + 1); dv2 = ((maF1 - maS1) - (maF2 - maS2)); //---- return(dv1 - dv2); }" the divergence function is not computing a divergence, it returns : dv1 - dv2 = (maF1 - maS1) - ((maF1 - maS1) - (maF2 - maS2)) = maF2 - maS2 so either, it is useless to compute maF1 and maS1 or dv2 should be equal to (maF2 - maS2) to compute a divergence (which, I think was your original intention) This "correction" may improve results, but most certainly will require new prefered settings tweaking, which take some time... Olivier

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Testing Phoenix4.2 for over a week now and here are the results. As usual, FXDD outperformed IBFX. Alpari is in between. It is weird that the difference in spread and datafeed can have such an impact on the results. Making one account a winner while the other losses. Maybe next step is not testing an EA, but which broker.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Guys: I'm beginning to wonder and and quite sure now that every trade can be taken for a profit when manual intervention is taken once the trade is in the money. Or.....the next best thing is to build in a breakeven + stop once you are in the money. Reason...I believe this now is that every trade with the flip of a coin is 50/50 without any strategy whatsoever. Therefore, if you flip a coin and take a trade their is a 50/50 chance of having a winning trade and ofcourse a 50/50 chance of having a losing trade. Our strategy is supposed to give us an edge. The rest is money management. So if you can get to breakeven + 1 then let the trade go until you hit a specific target or trail it by a specific number...you can probably have close to 90% win rate every time. The losers will come when the trade goes against you right away and then a tight stop should prevent that from getting out of hand. In conclusion, I really believe the breakeven + Stop with a trail from there is the best way to pursue auto trading. Having a target limits your winnings. Yes, a lot of breakeven + stops will hit with a small winner, however, we are looking for the trades that continue on for larger profits to give us our take home pay. Its the old addage....cut the losers short and let the winners run. I didnt see a breakeven + stop noted in the phoenix ea.....can that be added? Thanks, Joules360

The ironic thing for me, is that USD/CAD and USD/CHF are far and away the best performers for me. I've racked up seven or eight closed trades between the two pairs and only one floating loss on USD/CAD. I'm manually following (trading) these two pairs with my own non-MT4 broker and it's been doing me well so far. GBP/USD is by far the worst performer for me, and has been cut, with a EUR/USD and EUR/JPY cut coming soon at their present course. GBP/JPY is middle ground, it's not as proliferous with the profit as the USD/CAD and USD/CHF pairs, but it holds it's own none-the-less. This is all on an IBFX mini-demo mind you. Attached is the statement.

Hi Hendrick, Did you get my PM about my contact info?

Hi, Yes I have! I will be there in the weekend. See you!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi Hendrick, I'm glad to see you're doing well with Phoenix and congratulations on the excellent standings in the Trading Championship. What I want to ask you here is, when you first developed Phoenix and you did your backtests, what kind of success rates did your backtests achieve and what do they continue to achieve based on your current version (s). Reason why I ask, is that I have been working on my EA (Flyer! - You may be familiar with it if you have noticed the thread) and I'm getting tremendous win/loss ratios now approaching 95% or better over hundreds of trades. But to be frank, I don't trust the results that well. So I'm just curious how other people's EA's perform on the backtests compare to live trading. Of course I'm doing forward testing too, but that will take time. Thank you for your time and I wish you continued luck with the championship. Marci aka GirlFlyer

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi GirlFlyer, as Hendrick really has alot to do, I'll give you a quick answer, too. For MT4 Backtesting use this for pretty accurate backtesting: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...0&amp;postcount=15 If you don't have a good modelling quality (anything below 90%), forget the results :/. Maybe I am not telling you anything new, then please tell me, then I'll DEFINATELY have a look at your EA! D

--- 帖子 #305 ---
So far in short testing, it seems the pairs with JPY are the most productive. Anyone else see this?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi all, Does Phoenix_EA_v4_2_03 exist? I've seen it mentioned but can only see v4_2_02 to download. I apologise if it's somewhere in here but I've been through the thread about 4 times looking for it and now my eyes have fallen out and my head hurts, so even if it is here I won't see it. Thanks to Hendrick for the thread - great stuff. Cheers

--- 帖子 #307 ---
lol aww. Yes it does exist and some of us are forward testing it on demo accounts. Attached is the file you seek.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi GirlFlyer &amp; Hendrick, I've been running both of your EAs on separate accounts and personally I'm VERY afraid of the results. Both EA's seem to be extremely sensitive to the quality of the price feed coming in. To the point where on one broker the EA is reasonably profitable where on another it makes a loss over the same period of time. These are on demo accounts and once you get to live accounts then I'm afraid that it may be even worse with the addition of stop-hunting and other nasties that the brokers use, etc… I have to admit that at this point in time I have no idea as to how to desensitize the EAs and make them more broker neutral. Personally, I'd be happy to see a point or two differences in entry and exit scenarios, but on a couple (rare) occasions, I've noticed the same EA take a contradicting position depending on the broker, and that really worries me. The only way that I could think of trying to work is to ether: 1) make all price decisions off a short MA, for example 5-10 ticks, but that introduces another lag into the system that is undesirable, OR 2) use a quorum of feeds and average them out, but I have no idea on how to do this automatically within MT4. It seems to be impossible to connect to multiple servers from the one program, OR 3) somebody has some other ideas, most likely better.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Thanks Mun - appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I'm having the same problem. An idea I came up with a while ago is to have the EA run with whatever datafeed gives the best results on one MT4 platform, and carry the signals over to another platform. For example, let's say that this EA performs best on Alpari's demo feed, but you want to trade the EA with an IBFX live account. You would need to write some type of program that takes the signals from the Alpari platorm and enters them on the IBFX platform. If Alpari gives you a signal to buy USDJPY at 119.00, the program would then enter that same signal on the IBFX platform. Obviously, there will be some difference in price because the feeds are different. The program would have to completely ignore IBFX's datafeed and take the signal anyway. This would obviously require some programming skills. No idea where to begin.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
hi could Hendrick tell me that settings uses? thank

--- 帖子 #312 ---
please read more than just the most recent posts. That is, RTFM(!) - read the phoenix manual, some general information about Phoenix or read/understand the code before you ask this kind of questions. I am not trying to be rude, I'm just annoyed by people who don't even read the first post (there is A LOT of important information!). And to answer you question: If you asked what settings Hendrick is using then the answer is: (as described in the first Post/attachments) Phoenix has "preffered settings" - different for each pair to match the pair's individual character.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
It's a fact that there are differences in data-feed from brokers for demo-accounts. But I'm not so sure if this applies in the same way to live-accounts. I always use neuimex.com for my demo-accounts and they have assured me that there's no difference between demo- and live-feeds. So open a demo-account with them or ask your own broker about this. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

If so, please give me the conditions for it.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Currency Correlation:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; If there’s a strong correlation between currencies and one is open then open a trade for a correlated currency.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Did I forgot something? Please give me some feedback on this.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Yes you forgot something...remember to soak the strawberries for at least 12 hours!!! I haven't had a chance to update things but it looks like P4 had a good last couple of days. We were doing 24 hour ops. on the bay last night and the lower unit of the outboard decided to let go at about 11:30pm in the middle of a thunderstorm..with a barge coming by about 200 yards away..SEA TOW SEA TOW!!! Got in about 2am this morning. Either way, if the TP can be adjusted according to the open position profit that would be a great idea. It looks as if most of the entries go into a 'profit area', linger, then can move out for a loss. This profit area looks like 10-15 pips that can be locked in or exited. I'm not sure how reducing the TP or using a TS would affect the logic (Spock?) of the EA but I hate giving pips back. If the money is on the table...take it! P4 makes enough trades a day where a smaller TP 'area' could increase the win%, but then again that might lead to more trades per day with the SL still at 84 so the few losses could wipe out one day's profits...tough one...

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Ok Palmer, now you did it!! I was laughing out loud that much that I touch my keyboard and next to my keyboard was my glass of wine! I had to change keyboard before I could write you this reply. And Palmer, if "the key is still under the mat" first thing I expect to see is a new keyboard instead of your strawberries! And when it comes to the rest of your message, I think you're on the right track. I had a very interesting conversation about this with Matt Chumas. I think &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5 will be a lot more interesting than &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 (and a more profitable I hope!). &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Take care buddy!!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Keep up the good work on Phoenix 07, Hendrick! This thing is going to evolve into something excellent.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
"Spill the wine...dig that girl." OK, who sang it? Anyone...amyone. "The answer my friend, is blowin' in the wind, the answer is blowing in the wind." Sorry about the keyboard debacle. I guess I need to apologize to everyone if it's going to slow you up. "I'm sorrrry....I'm sorrrry" OK, who sang that line? Done with the music trivia. It's Friday, the week is over and my ladyfriend and I are off for sushi. If P5 can be a little more quick with smaller profits and have a better profit to loss ratio (SL?) then I don't think too many people will complain. Is this leaning towards Firebird??? I haven't seen the first hint of that anywhere in this thread so whatever kind of improvement can be done, it will just make this EA an even better EA. I guess I owe you a bottle of red and the key is still under the mat boss. Have a good weekend everyone.

Did a lot of experiments today to further developing Phoenix. I think I found a nice addition. Imagine this: as soon as the first trade (TP=42, SL=84) is a certain amount of pips in profit (say 32 pips) that will be the sign for to place a second trade in the same direction. But now with a TP of 100 and a SL of 100. I did some backward testing for this. Phoenix_5_Pure.htm with the usual settings and Phoenix_5_Double.htm with the second trade option and with a setting that closes a trade after 62 hours. Look at the difference.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Harry: Would the SL on both positions be at 100 from entry or just the second position? Interesting stuff....

--- 帖子 #322 ---
The second trade is a new one and so is the SL. But I will check what will happen if we put the SL at 100 from the first entry.

The JPY 'influence'...

--- 帖子 #325 ---
GBPJPY and USDJPY are doing great. But I'm still not satisfied about the EURJPY and the CHFJPY. But it's only a matter of time before those two will reveal their "secrets". We will get there Palmer!

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Harry: As far as the JPY influence goes...I don't think that would actually mean anything until a few hundred trades are made. The larger the data set, the more meaning it has. It is interesting though... KJenkins wins a pip.. "The answer my friend..." = Bob Dylan "I'm sorry..." = R.E.M. "Where'd my pips go" = Palmer

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Harry- Great, man! Just from visually looking at the different markets, it seems like the pairs with the JPY in them "trend" better. The EUR and GBP seem to be much more choppy. Maybe I am wrong, but if Phoenix is optimized for just one or two pairs I would't complain. Just babblin maybe. Anyway, Keep it goin'!

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thinking out loud here, my opinion or fact...who knows...butt, since the USD is the most followed currency to trade and with all of the eco news releases that are tied to it just about every week the volatility will be and is higher per day (per position) = news whipsaws. Currencies that are not tied to the USD may not react as violently so the trends should be smoother and the volatility should be lower....Soooooo, still thinking out loud here....should we only run EA's on non USD pairs.... Wayyyyy too soon...

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hi Harry! Been on a trip so haven’t had time to post for a while. Please find attached the relationship between time of an open trade and Profit/Loss which I find on my Neuimex and North Finance accounts. Will do my FXDD account as soon as my brain is back on GMT +1 too ;-) Too premature to draw any conclusions I guess but will keep updating in the future.

Just a quick recap of the development of the next version of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt;. &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5 has some nice additions. One of them is opening a second trade (in the same direction) when the first trade is a certain amount of pips in profit. The first trade is using a low TP and a much lower SL than a TP of 42 and a SL of 84. Consider this first trade as a scout that is exploring the market. If the market is not right for &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; the first trade will end in a loss. This loss is however limited due to a low SL. But when the scout is in profit the second trade (with a higher TP and SL) will open with a fair chance of becoming a profitable trade (and so is your first trade).&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Other additions are:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; - closing trades after a certain amount of hours (seems to work for a couple of pairs).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; - moving your SL to breakeven when your trade is in profit.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; ... And so on and so on.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I think &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will be more profitable in the long run. But one thing: I need your support!! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; And now a very small critical remark:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; When the new &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; thread just started there were a couple of visitors that were very enthusiastic. I haven't seen these visitors lately. And that’s not surprising at all, because they are "the takers": People that are willing to try a new EA for a week and hops to another EA when the first one isn’t profitable within the first couple of days. Well, goodbye to them, we don't need them! And that's why my love and my gratitude goes to the regular visitors of this thread. They understand that developing a good Expert Advisor takes a lot of time. I hope you guys will continue your support for the coming time!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; And let be honest, in the Contest &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is still occupying the fourth place out of 260 EA's! So it has some potential. And together we will develop &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; further into a very good EA. Let's go for it!!!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Hey, we love this new tread. I THINK i'M ADDICTED. Tx Hendrick, the amount of time you put in here is absolutly amazing, and I think we all appricate it temendously. And these new additions are really awesome. Can't wait for Phoenix 5

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hey Vince!!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Back to earth again Vince? This is a great stuff! Will help me a lot. I think you will find the new option for &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5 to close a trade after a certain amount of hours very useful! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Vince, I must have your e-mail address here somewhere, but I can't find it. Will you send me your e-mail once again so I can send you the beta version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5? &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Some day we will meet each other somewhere in the sky (I'm travelling a lot) and I hope you will give me then an inside view of your cockpit! Imagine that!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Take care buddy!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Harry&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Greetings Harry and gang. Support? I've been following and forward testing since the beginning and though it may seem like i'm a silent observer, it is sometimes my style not to post if there is nothing helpful to report on my end. I've been testing the Phoenix on usd pairs mainly and am basicaly at breakeven. Reading the above from Palmer has promted me to begin a new account with just JPY related pairs in today's pre-market setup. I checked in over at the contest as i do each Weekend awaiting the results. Good trading. Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Did notice this too.. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Can imagine it must be rather frustrating for you to see people be interested up to the point were they have been explained how to setup the EA and than 'bugger off'... Maybe I shouldn’t say anything myself... ;-) because haven't been able to post last week.. (trip to the &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;US&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;). But you can count on my support (how ever limited/insignificant my input will be… at least I'll do my best).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Will post the rest of my findings (see post 329) of my FXDD account as promised later this evening! Will include the Detailed Statements of the past week soon too. Keep up your great work Harry, don’t let some people spoil it for you!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi Tom, It's up and down for now. But in this stage we learn a lot form our profits as well as from our losses. Keep us posted with your results and stay tuned for the next version of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. Appreciate your contribution!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = u2 /&gt;&lt;u2 &gt;&lt;/u2 &gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;u2 &gt; &lt;/u2 &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Keep us posted Thom!! We need your results.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
As long as I have people like VinceTheBeast to support me I will continue the development of Phoenix!!

Harry: When P5 comes out, should we abandon P4? I'm going to continue to run P4 for a while either way and still track how the nonUSD pairs will perfrom. My FXDD demo account may expire within the next few weeks so there may be a burp in the results but I'll fill in those blanks the best I can. Does anyone know of a longer term MT/broker? FXDD's (even for live clinets) is only 90 days....

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Palmer, I just send you a beta of Phoenix 5. I believe ttp://www.alpari-idc.com/ has endless demo-accounts.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
That is correct. My personal concern was that since i will be opening my live EA-Only-account with xyz broker, i wanted to run the foward demo tesing on xyz's demo platform as i've read many posts suggesting that results may, and often do differ between brokers. I do use Aplari's feed on my non-EA MT4 to trade manually from as i'm just using the charts for TA and entering off the pricing from my live broker's trade station (which are usually within a pip or two anyway). Cheers, Thom PS. Harry, guess you've got good job security cuz there are alot of us here rooting for you and Phoenix !

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi Hendrik, As I read your post I was very excited to read about the new features to be incorporated in the new Phoenix and I thought how much heart and soul you put into this EA, and how good Phoenix is doing in the contest then I got to the part where you said "and now a small critical remark" as I read I started to slink down in my chair feeling as though you were talking just to me and I thought, OMG, Hendrik thinks I'm just a taker, no contribution what a bum! That's really not the case because I respect and appreciate all your efforts. I'm just one of those quiet types. There are five or six threads in this forum that I look forward to reading everyday, this one is greatness. I'll try to chime in more often especially with results. I have been running Phoenix 3 - 4 (2007) on two different live accounts albeit very small accounts. I'm doing it this way because I think demo results are skewed and do not represent true results. My intention was to post my results from last week by now but IBFX live servers are off-line and have been since yesterday which is really irritating. As soon as they get back online and I can access my results I'll zip them up and post them.(just noticed a new thread where some people cannot connect to IBFX after applying update 198 looks like I may have to reinstall) Immensely Grateful

Well didn't need to reinstall...work is being done on servers. woulda been nice if they could let acct holders know via their own message system.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Howdy. Some more test results. This time I've included 5 brokers. I've included the Detailed reports per broker twice. One is sorted by the time of the close of a trade; the other is sorted by currency pair. The other file is the updated 'pair versus time' spreadsheet. This one includes the results from my FXDD account. CU

--- 帖子 #346 ---
They said they would inform us from now on. NOTE they will be working on their live and / or demo servers the next few weekends. http://www.patricknouvion.com/IBFX/viewtopic.php?t=837 They have been telling me that they will get us back up by opening time which is only 45 minutes from now. We will see. It has been problematic not being able to print out my account history or view my open trades this weekend.

This really sucks...I keep getting the "connect wav" but just common error follows then "no connection" I think they REALLY fixed them. sorry if this is inappropriate place to vent this

hi, i am impressive for good backtesting, is phoenix_5 available for forward-test ? best regards giapel

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi guys. I've been away for the past few days. When I came back CPU was at 100%... culprit was MS Outlook . Anyway, stuff was still working (but talking a long time) so I think it had no effect on P4 but I'm not certain. I also found the EA was not running on the GBPJPY chart . I've put everything back to normal now but take the results of thursday and friday for what its worth. Seems to have hit a few stops. Anyway, North Finance statement as of 22 Oct 06. Starting equity $5000, current equity $5257. Forward testing pairs USDCHF, GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, USDCAD, EURGBP, EURCHF, EURJPY, GBPJPY, GBPCHF, EURAUD with Pheonix_EA_v4_2_03 on M30 charts.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
First 2 pages are closed trades, 3rd page is current float. I'll try to recap pos/neg pip totals later. I like the green color the most! will post acct #2 in a few...great job Hendrick!

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I'm not sure if you know about it, but it might be easier to save it as a "detailed statement" next time. To do this you right click in your account history window and select "Save as Detailed Report". It then generates an html page for you complete with an equity curve graph attached to the bottom. Not trying to sound mean, just trying to help.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Both files below are for the same live mini account. In the zip file I put the total wins and losses for each pair. The test has run for 2 weeks. I am using the latest preferred settings and 15min charts. The test ran 24hrs a day for the trading week. The first week was great. Last week was poor. Things looked even worse before Thursday and Friday. Over all Phoenix is still ahead as far as pips are concerned. I plan to start a new test using only the most profitable pairs. I am still trying to figure out how to use excel to determine the number of hours each trade was open.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
it doesn't sound mean and I do know how to save as a detailed statement but there's some other trades in there that kind of skew the graph but here it is anyway. Is it a pain in the butt the way I did it? Thanks for trying to help

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I'm not gonna lie, it was hard for me to understand your account statement in the format that you uploaded your results in. However, good to know that you already knew what I was talking about with the html report, and you're trying to help us out by trying to filter out out those non-phoenix trades with the pictures. Sorry if I seem abrasive.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Interesting results for the USDCAD and the EURAUD. Dropped them earlier, but seeing these results I think I was to hasty.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi Hendrick I started Phoenix 2-3 on 13 October. Pairs are USDCHF, EURJPY, USDJPY, GBPJPY, CHFJPY. I had some nasty closes in GBPJPY (2) and USDCHF (2). The GBPJPY seems to do the worst of all. I have trouble uploading zip files. Will try again...

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Great Vince! For me these are excellent results to study. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Attached are my test results of Phoenix 4.2 for last week (the last closed trade is from today). I hope it will be better this week.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hendrick I use Camzip but I cannot get the thing to work as it should. Can you suggest annother zip-program I can use? Ben

--- 帖子 #360 ---
We are here for the long haul, Hendrick. I got in the game somewhat late but am grateful it's here. I was showing my brother the contest and this post and he was really amazed! I will post my results soon and appreciate everbodys. I look at them. I really just started testing middle of last week and even added a few more pairs today. Have a good one!! (Time now to shoot a little pool at my bro's.)

Remeber that you can always change the priority of a process under windows. This way when you get a "rouge" process like Outlook stuffing up your system it will have a very limited impact on running your MT4 program. By default, process when they start up in Windows they will be assigned a priority of "Normal" ... go to Task Manager and find the processes called "terminal.exe" (these are for running MT4) and you can safely bump them up to "Above Normal". You can have multiple copies of these depending on how many MT4 demo or live accounts you have installed. I wouldn't recommend going higher as this can cause system instability if your MT4 programe start to misbehave. If you have any more questions then let me know and i will try to answer them. For live accounts (and only for live accounts) I'd potentially consider using a priority of "High". WARNING: Never, never, never set you priority to "Real Time". This WILL cause you problems with your system.

I've attached updated results over the last week running Phoenx 4.2.03 on 3 broker accounts. Results are a mixed bag, some up some down. Since launching this version I've bumped up the MaximumRisk to 0.1 (as opposed to 0.05 as default). As Harry mentoned once before ... if you are going to become rich you have take on a bit more risk. And looking at the results, I'd be willing to run with it at a higher risk parameter.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Maybe ... I was thinking about that optimisation of the open, stop loss and take profit levels.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Oops ... forgot to mention the results for the tests posted above ... the IBFX results I wouldn't trust too much. I've been having difficulty keeping that demo running. They appear to have a timeout setting or something as the IBFX demo account is pretty consistently showing "No connection" in the mornings when I arrive at work. So it means that overnight it must have "broken" at some point in time. I don't really have a way of telling when that happens. The other two demo accounts haven't had these problems. I think that I'm going to substitute IBFX with FXDD in the future.

Howard - would you mind showing us the detailed statement please (Account History tab -&gt; Right click -&gt; "Save as detailed report...")? It will help us see the trades on the individual pairs (some pairs perform well, others not so good). Thanks.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Last week was the first week out of many, many weeks of forward testing w/IBFX that this situation became noticeable on my end. Three out of the five mornings i came to the EAs with them showing "No connection", and sometimes it took closing down that MT4 and reopening it to get things up (would not do kick in with "rescan servers" or "Login"). I would hope this would not be the case w/live accounts at IBFX? I'm still planning on opening a small .5k or 1.0k mini and trade micro lots w/the EA sometime soon. : ) Thom

There's no doubt in my mind that your system Phoenix WORK. Let's impove it by mutitude test. You are on very good way. Sorry for my english. I'm basicly french. Ciao

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Great job on the contest, Hendrick! I had been in a trade (negative) with the USD/JPY from Friday until this evening so I missed the nice trade you had in the contest today. No doubt that a time limit/nimble stop, with the winning trades getting added to will help Phoenix. Can't wait for the revisions!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I'm starting to keep track the win loss record of each currency. I realize this needs to be done over months not weeks but I need to start somewhere. I'll try to post this a couple of times a week. It is hard to understand how the outcome can be so different between two brokers. EURUSD was very different. GBPJPY looks good.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hendrick, great idea on the reversing signals! I was just contemplating that a couple weeks ago. I see only one problem that should be pretty easily remedied:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; How do we avoid having phoenix place many trades during periods of little activity and taking many 5 or 10 pip losses? &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Possible Solutions:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 1. Do we limit phoenix to only reversing signals after X pip movement either up or down?&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 2. Do we only allow phoenix to place one extra trade in the opposite direction while leaving the first trade open with the original stops?&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 3. Combination of both? What are everyone's thoughts on this? L2T

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Due to problems with Interbank price feed going up and down like a yo-yo, I've decided to pull the plug on this one in my tests. I simply don't trust the results when they deviate so much form the others. What it does show is that for the EA to be effective you do need to have a constant connection to the Internet and your PC up and running, otherwise you will get crap results as illustrated in the statement below. I've replaced interbank with neuimex ... we'll see how it performs over the next couple of weeks. This is running with Phoenix 4.2.03 version on all currencies that have settings for them coded in the EA (12 in total).

--- 帖子 #379 ---
lol I started running P4 on an M15 on IBFX a couple of days ago but it kept going down so I switched to Neuimex this morning too! I thought others were going to FXDD so I chose Neuimex. So from now I'm going to be posting 2 statements: one of the M15 on Neiumex and one of the M30 on North Finance. Here they are so far. Neuimex is all pairs EA supports. North Finance is USDCHF, GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, USDCAD, EURGBP, EURCHF, EURJPY, GBPJPY, GBPCHF, EURAUD, CHFJPY (I found CHFJPY was supported by NF demo account only this morning so the EA's been working on that also from today).

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Nice way of presenting your findings nvwine! Will try to do it in a similar way in the future. (That is, if you don't mind me 'steeling' your layout of course... ;-) )

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I am a complete bonehead jackass. For some reason, I wasn't running P4 on all of the pairs specified; just seven of them. Don't ask me why, how, who, or what the #$@!. I'm not in front of my machine so I can't relay what the pairs running are. Sorry Harry. It amazes me how I just make it through the day sometimes....I'm pissed.

Hello to everybody! Sorry for my English. Does anybody have settings for Phoenix 4.2 for GBP/JPY?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Patience Harry ... soon you will be able to!!!

--- 帖子 #388 ---
The most recent version of 4.2 is in post #140. If you set PrefSettings=true when running the EA you don't need to enter any settings. If it is for backtesting use MetaEditor and look at the settings inside the EA. Use it on the 15min charts. As far as which currency pairs have preferred settings and what those settings are use MetaEditor and look in the EA. I know the thread is long but at least try to read the posts by Hendrick. You don't really want to use an EA to trade the market with out learning all you can about the EA. Start with what Hendrick put in post #1.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi Harry Some day we will live from this and others will enjoy our success too!

--- 帖子 #390 ---
@hendrick when forward test in micro account this ea execute 0.1 lot, I want use 0.01 lot...where setting that must change,

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hendrick, First let me start by thanking you. On one of your posts you mention that your goal is to make money and allow others too and then continue with life helping out the less fortunate. I together with many more share your vision and hope that this vision becomes successful along with your great achievements. You have also shown us that consistency and having a vision is something more powerful then anything else and I thank you for setting a great example for all of us. As for Phoenix. I was looking at the open chart after doing some testing and noticed that the majority of "losers" were the ones that continued against your position. So even thought they left the envelope and were suppose to return they never returned. Also some had returned back to the envelope BORDER but because your take profit was higher then the distance back to the envelope they drifted back out of the envelope causing a lose. Some suggestions to improve the above. Build a mechanism that actually confirms we are talking about a spike that left the envelope and returned. you can do this in the following way 1. wait for price to move out of envelope (that you already do) . 2. Once it reaches the position where you normally would open a counter trending position just raise a flag but don't open the position yet. 3. wait till it reaches at least X pips +- your flag point (+- depending if your short or long) and then wait for it to return to your flag position. The top 3 were also suggested also by L2T (Learning2Trade) from the above post and I think you mentioned (can't find where) reverse indicators 4. BUT I THINK THE BEST WAY TO ACTUALLY CONFIRM WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A SPIKE IS THAT IF ALL THE ABOVE HAPPENS WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME (can be optimized) 5. once it reaches the flag point open the position but now you are actually with the "trend" moving back to your envelope. As for taking profit. you can build a take profit target#1 once it reaches back the envelope border (only if it's a winning gain because border changes dynamically) and then target 2 can be the original 42 pips (for euro/dollar). of course moving from target 1 to 2 you would also modify your stop loss. I also notices that Fibonacci exits (take profit and stop loss) are very powerful. You can see that looking at some of your competitors especially Vince Wells from Position#2 in the competition. I know this would dramatically change your ea but perhaps this strategy can be used for target 3 and 4 If you look at Vice's Journal and Experts tab you will see how the EA keeps modifying the targets and stop loss as each fibonacci line is crossed. I know some of these issues have been addressed by others but perhaps my little angle could add to the joint effort. Thanks again for being such a wonderful inspiration. Reuven

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hi Reuven, Thanks a lot for sharing your thoughts. Very interesting material! I think it can be of use for the further development of Phoenix. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
&lt;!-- / message --&gt;Thanks for help! I have read the hole thread before posting my first reply, and unfortunately I didn't understand that in the post#140 there were presettings for all the currencies. Thanks again! P.S. I've backtested Phoenix 4.2 from April 2005 till January 2006, the results are floating aroud the initial deposit. From January 2006 deposit started to grow. Modelling quality 90%. Do you have the same results for that period in 2005? &lt;!-- / message --&gt;

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I'm sorry maybe I do not understand what your looking for. If you want settings for a currency pair to backtest you can look in the most recent version of the EA using MetaEditor to find them. I am attaching the settings section of the Phoenix EA in post #140 below. If this is not what you are looking for you may want to explain a little more about what settings your looking for. As for backtesting someone else will have to answer you as to their multi-year test.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
As I understand it, Hendrick uses half a year for backtesting since this seems to work best for his EA. Therefore, backtesting a longer period will give you different results.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Running Phoenix on one account where you trade all the currencies that have settings for them (currently 12) means that you could have up to 12 open positions. Using the default settings for MaximumRisk of 0.05, you would most likely be safe to maintain 12 open positions. But this leads to possible problems if you bump the MaximumRisk up to lets say 0.1 or above. Your reserve margin requirements may be quite thin. In fact if only half the positions went against you then there is a high likely hood of getting margin called on the account. Currently with 9 positions open my margin requirements across 100:1 leverage accounts is sitting at around only 180%. However bumping up the MaximumRisk factor is highly desirable for Phoenix as the default settings has rather limited gains, while doubling the risk factor brings in significantly more profits over the longer term. Now thinking out loud here ... what about adding an enhancement that factors in the number of maximum possible open positions and factors that into the calculations of lot size. Thereby reducing the chances of getting a margin call. Harry , What do you think? sounds good, sounds bad, opinion? I know that this could be easily solved by simply splitting the account into two and trade half the currencies on one account and half on another, but I'm suggesting this as a form of simplifying account management at a particular broker.

Hey Salty! (Sorry I wasn't there in the weekend at MSN. Will try next weekend). I think this piece of code: lot=NormalizeDouble(AccountFreeMargin()*MaximumRisk/1000.0,digits); takes your free margin in account to increase or decrease your lot size.

Hi, &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt; Phoenix &lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5 has several options to open a second trade after the first trade. From back testing I've learned that your results can improve substantially when you start a first trade with a low TP and SL. As soon as this trade is a certain number of pips in profit you open a second trade in the same direction. Seems to work. Problem for now is that a different SL and TP for the first trade mean that your default settings for a pair have to be changed. And that means testing and testing. Wish I could make an EA with the same settings for all pairs. I think Phoenix 6 can do that.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Hi, Correct. I have to change the code for Micro Accounts. Will be fixed in version 5.

Hey Salty, Are you offering me a job as EA developer?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Salty ... I like it Check out the attachment in this post, you'll see what I mean in terms of the low margin buffer that i was describing. This is for a demo account so in reality it doesn't count as brokers don't care about it, but if this was live, then I'd be worried. I'm just thinking that maybe in your calculations we could reduce the AccountFreeMargin() by half that way increasing it's significance. For example change it to: lot=NormalizeDouble( (AccountFreeMargin()/2) *MaximumRisk/1000.0,1); What do you think? Don't worry about last weekend, we can catch up this weekend if you wish.

I'm now watching the USDJPY because I have a BUY opened in the contest. It's testing and testing over again the resistance of 119.00. Please don't break it!!

--- 帖子 #403 ---
And why not ... I'd be willing to offer what I think is a very generous 50%/50% profit split for the right EA.

Hi Gazzoni, Your English is ok! Look at my English! It's not important if you be fluent in English or not, as long as you can express your ideas and feelings to others. No one in this forum will tell you to leave because your English is not good enough! &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; What I do for a living? I'm working as an ICT-manager. But one day I hope to make a living out of developing MetaTraders Expert Advisors. I'm not that interested in making money (well, on the other side it's important because it gives financial freedom) but I' more interested in the creative part of making EA's. That part of an EA that is generating signals for BUYS or SELLS. There are so much ideas in my head that I hardly know where to begin. Well, let’s first finish &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; 5. And after that versions 6, 7 and so on. And every version will be better than the previous one !!

Hendrick- Any estimated release date on Phoenix 5?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Harry: I'm using the standard reference material here on FF for MQL but they lack a lot of good sample code for indicators and EA's. Do you know of any other sources for MQL programming/learning/examples? I'm doing my best to contribute something, or should I say contribute something 'one day' but I'm still in the basics.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I hear ya, Palmer. I kicked around trying to learn C++ and even started a book. It is daunting! I would love to be able to program and test theories but programming is not something I can do. All I would want is to program MQ4. They say it is like C++ but do you have to learn the whole language to test EA's and indicators?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
No, you don't have to learn all of C or C+. Probably just the basic syntax of C would be enough. The tricky part is MQL itself is where to put all the (), {}, and the MQL syntax. I think the easiest thing to do is code a basic custom indicator then turn that into a basic EA without worry about results. The important thing is to compile it without errors and MAKING SURE it does what it is supposed to do on a chart. I've been looking at the indicator code for the the included stuff with MT4 and running with that. I've got lots of ideas that I want to look at...it'll just take a little while. I keep telling myself that the markets will be there tomorrow...as far as my account, well, that's a different story ;-)

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I have the whole weekend for myself! The rest of the family has left me (don't worry it’s only temporary!) so it's me and &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5! Will finish it (and post it) this weekend!!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Glad it's only temporary ... would hate to think that because of this "EA stuff" your family ditched you! Do you need a hand in checking / coding / testing the release?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Palmer, I will look at C then. I have started the tutorial on MQL. Your right, the markets will be there tomorrow, I just need to find the patience to learn the code and start one indicator at a time. Maybe all is for naught with Phoenix. Set it and forget it is the dream. I need to chase that sunshine no matter what the time of year.

Please guys! Tell me what the USDJPY is going to do! (the Contest you know, I have a BUY now) It's waiting for something! We will have the USD " Interest Rate Statement" within an hour.

They say interest rates will hold, but what about the comments on the direction of the economy?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Guess what Palmer; first thing I'm going to do Saturday is visit the market and buy myself a lot of good strawberries (you know why) and some boxes of cigars. I know it's a bad habit (the cigars I mean), but I really can't resist the combination of a good cigar, an excellent wine and &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

The longer you will hold the more you will make on the swap ... so don't worry too much. As long it doesn't get to your SL, then you won't have a problem. BTW, it's got about 60 pips in reserve before it gets there, and that's quite a lot.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I didn't know you were a cigar man!! I had a Rocky Patel (1992) last weekend, a little smoother than the 1990. Going to pick up a few more. Of course you can never go wrong with a good Arturo Fuente Gran Reserve either!!! I'm not in front of my MT4 computer right now...sorry, no help on that one...We're all pulling for ya dude...

It's a good EA BUT doesnt always give good results .. today it cost me about 200 $$ but again i got them back by IT . Hope to get answers from you OR any of the guys who knows about it .

Hi everybody! What do you think about some somehow hedging the account by putting two P4 with different MAGIC numbers on two windows USD/JPY M15? The second P4 should be put after the first one has already opened position, so that the second P4 opens the position in the other direction.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Ah I am the complete opposite! I can write code no problem (its my career) but I don't know very much about strategies etc. I've had a look at some EA's. I think learning the whole C++ is overkill - C++ has lots of features that are not in MQL4. Just learn MQL4 straight, or learn just C (not C++) to get a feel for syntax etc then learn the MQL4 API (functions etc). Even in C there is no need to learn the standard functions (like string functions). MQL4 will have its own API and knowledge of C functions won't be very useful. I think just learn MQL4 straight. The syntax is logical you will get the hang of it with practice . Don't just keep hitting the compile button and guessing the fixes until it doesn't complain! Hendrick - looking forward to P5, sounds like it's gonna be awesome. Good luck with the USD/JPY on the contest!

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I totally agree with Mun, just learn MQL right away, it's pretty easy! Hendrick: I am SO looking forward to P5! Right now, P4 is already performing pretty good (6-1) since last Friday.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
It's like learning a new language. I have found it difficult so far. I definately will have a try at C then. You guys that know programming ought to program EA's for money. Nothing outrageous, just a fair amount for the EA desired. This will help you learn strategies also. There is a topic on "Whats your favorite indicator". Man I found some good food for thought there and some triable strategies too. About the MQL tutorial, I found the writer had english as a second language and thus found it hard to follow. It's just me though. It doesn't come real easy. Lets take Phoenix 5, 2007 to the bank and it will all be for naught.

Let's assume that you hedge all your positions, can you please explain as to when you expect to make money? Apart from doubling your transactions costs (pay spread twice as opposed to once) all you positions would net out to zero as what you would make on one you would loose on the other?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
To saltcafe Let me explain. In Metatrader 4 Alpari you can have both long and short positions at the same time without netting each other. They are independent. If you put P4 on USDJPY 15min, for example, at 5 am GMT, P4 sells, then you open another chart USDJPY 15 min and put P4 at 7am, P4 buys, and the point is that the first position was opened,for example, at 119.40 (stop 120.22, take - 118.98), the second position BUY at 119.15(stop - 118.33, take 119.57). Yesterday I had similar situation, so I got + from the first position, and second one still fluctuates. As I have noticed, P4 opens positions depending on at what time you put it on the chart. I am testing P4 CONTEST&lt;!-- / message --&gt;&lt;!-- sig --&gt;

nikkei: What are your settings?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
I double that, plus how did you go about with the testing? Any rhyme or reason, etc.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
The settings are listed at the top of the testing report. We can test his settings ourselves and see. I would suggest when running optimizing and backtesting tests for comparing multiple test results we use the same percent risk for each test. Changing the risk can skew the comparison results for other settings in my opinion. From personal experience I've found some of my best prior test results came from just trying different combinations and letting the program run for a day. Pure random luck. I'm trying to remember if Hendrick said to always test with preferredsettings=false and then manually entering the defaults settings? I hope nikkei has stumbled on something but I'll defer to Hendrick for further analysis.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Yeah I agree. Especially about some of the pairs, there seems to be a select few that do really well. I think Hendrick will be locked in his room all weekend finalizing P5....

--- 帖子 #439 ---
My results so far this week with phoenix 4 has also been poor. We have been in this rangeing market for the past 6 months which phoenix 4 is primed tuned for. I believe we are starting to head into trending market conditions which the added features of phoenix 5 is ready to exploit. Being able to add onto existing trades is definitly the right direction. Looking forward to it. &lt;!-- / message --&gt;

At me by optimization quotations Alpari and Velocity have mixed up. Parameters of adjustment yet do not use. Next week I shall write results of new optimization. Hendric how you think it is necessary to accumulate quotations M1 from each broker to use for testing? In fact results of tests online are at times various at different brokers.

Hello there, I just wanted to ask a few questions about the theory of Pheonix 4.2. I realize that Pheonix sees patterns or something that I don't see when it enters a trade. I guess what I would like to know is when is it apropriate to turn it on and off, and why the 84/42 theory? My appogies if this has been addressed prior to this tread. Thank you Hendrick for all of your hard work! Walrus

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I am pretty sure it's because 84/42 has achieved the best results in backtesting. Definately try different settings, but it seems the 84/42 keeps coming back the best. Those numbers are included in the things Hendrick is working on; basically adjusting them when price moves, adding to positive positions, etc. I am not sure if you need to turn it off, the idea is to turn it on and walk away.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
hello all.. I need someone plz to give me the latest settings for Phoenix_EA_v4_2_03 coz when i apply it to any chart , it dosent work .. so maybe i'm missing something . And tell me plz , with which pairs does it work the best ?? Thanx a lot .

--- 帖子 #444 ---
It was not a good week for my Phoenix tests. As often happens to me the demo account is still positive and the wheels fell off the wagon in the live account. When P5 arrives I'll switch a couple of tests to that but it is too soon to evaluate P4 as far as long term success. I may trim some currency pairs from my tests. My tests were also compromised this week because I ran them on a virtual private server. The crazy VPS had at least 1 problem every 24 hours. I think I'll move everything back to my own computers. I can not explain how the two tests can be so different. Both tests use the same preferred settings. The two tests below have the same format as last time. First sorted by currency pair and then the original report. Reminder to IBFX customers with live standard accounts - New server address starting Sunday.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
ditto. P4 took out a lot of stops this week. But thats the whole point of testing isn't it ?

A short recap on the development of Phoenix 5. Tomorrow I will post version 5 of Phoenix. You can use Phoenix 5 in three different modes: Phoenix Classic: same as Phoenix 4.2 but with extra functions like BreakEven, Close trades after x hours and so on. Phoenix SecondTrade: Open a second trade after the first trade is a certain amount of pips in profit. Very special and nice results. Phoenix 123: Open three trades at the same time (one of you posted this idea). Lot size 1 is 0.5, two is 1 and three is 1.5. This mode comes with a lot of possible settings. Very good results......! So, stay tuned! Phoenix is getting better by the day, so pick your copy tomorrow as long as it's free! (To all of you who sent me e-mails, I was just too focused on Phoenix 5 (bad habit). Sorry!. I will answer you all tomorrow.)

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Awesome! You touched on a couple of my thoughts (wow, that sounds dirty) that I was gonna post up here when I was reading just now. I look forward to testing the new version out.

Came across some very ugly errors! Will have to solve these first. Will post the new version at the end of the week.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; (&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5 will be a lot better than 4.2!)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #451 ---
No problem ... will continue running the demos on the previous version to compare results. Last week wasn't particularly good for the EA. We will see what this week brings.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
ok, First of all, i'm one desperate guy. after been weeks following this thread, weeks of forward testing, and some back testing, none, i mean none of them are showing profits. I thought this is not true, i must be missing something. After i've gone through the statement posted by everyone, finally i can make myself believe that this EA is a failure. I wondered why everyone get so excited about this EA, has anyone made $1000 with this EA yet? or even $100. I know we are here to help testing out the potential of phoenix EA. Well, test's over, the result is NEGATIVE for phoenixv2.02 specificly, v2.03 is no better, agree? Hope the new coming phoenix could do well. ~Keep it up ! Chad Life goes on

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Sofar I have only lost money on testing EA's, but that won't stop me. Some people dream of making money and when you can make money, then you dream of making money the lazy way. Who doesn't want to relax on the beach while your EA is making money at home! Happy tradings

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hey! I am not lazy! I merely prefer to work smarter, not harder. I view the EA as an evolutionary step down the system development path. Brainstorm a system, construct this system to prove it's viability, test, tweak and refine, automate it, build a new system, repeat.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi Chad, I think you're missing the point here. For now it's just testing and tweaking in order to find the right code and settings for &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. Failures are as good as successes because we can learn a lot of both. It's a process with a beginning and an end and we are somewhere in the middle of it. I don't think it's fair to call an EA a failure as long as it's still in development. What we need now is people who want to test &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;, study the code and post their ideas on how to improve &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. Hope your next post in this forum will be a little more constructive.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Regards,&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Hendrick.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hi hendrick, I do agree with you. It's just my nature, I told u i'm a deperate guy, nothing's fair to me. Sorry if my comment harms u, there's a chinese saying says that 'failure is the origin of success' . I agree that failure is as good as success. I been through lot of failure in my entire life, i believe my future success will comes from that point. I hope u understand me. As long as i'm still replying this thread, i'm supporting you, honestly. I can see u never give up with your EA which is what i've been admiring u of. I think it's matter of time when u could claim your success. I'm standing by here for your new version. Lastly, i have a little suggestion. I think we should determine the pairs that pheonix would do well in, and then continue the developement of the EA base on the few winning pairs. My theory is, running more pairs means more opportunity and in every opportunity there's risk and profits. My point is to play 'SAFE'. sorry if i'm talking nonsense. Chad Life goes on

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi Hendrick and All, I do wonder if there is wisdom in really focussing all attention on fine tuning Phoenix for just one currency - say, GBPUSD (which generally has the largest movements and therefore potentially the greatest profits.) Could various folk trialling numerous different currencies be a classic case of "too much information?" Especially when Hendrick has to interrupt his deliberations to consider and reply to all? This is not meant to diminish all the efforts of many fine folks, but maybe a concerted unified effort might speed things up and fine tune more effectively? Sorry . . . Regards, Grahame.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Ah don't be so impatient . We will soon have good settings for most of the pairs. It's just a matter of time and effort. Those who have followed this thread have heard some brilliant ideas been talked about over the past few weeks, some of which are making their way into Pheonix 5. It would be silly to drop effort on the other pairs at this stage. In the long run (i.e. when they become profitable) you will be glad they were there as they make more moeny and provide some diversification. If you are using this live for money (i.e. not testing) you don't have to run it on all pairs it supports. Just run it on the most profitable pairs (GBPJPY and USDJPY). But do remember this EA is still in development. Last week was a bad week for P4 so don't say we didn't warn you .

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Helo every1. I'm forward testing Phoenix 4.2.03 into all pairs avaliable in IBFX. What i did is set all JPY pairs to 0.15 MaximumRisk because they seems to be the best ones. And its working for me What i seen in the last week that the USD pairs have been messed up, but im hopefull that we'll find the best settings for it. I'll post my results soon... For now a have too many trades open.... Why when we backtesting in longer periods they give us a nice results and when we test for a short period (like 2 month) usualy they give a negative report? Hey Hendrick you're doing very very great at contest!! Congratulation, hope your EA keep working the same way till 31 december. I think you and Brazilian guy have the best EA. Because the others EA have had just a few trades and could be luck! But who knows..... Its just my $0.02.... Regards

Phoenix will be there, there is a lot of programming to do. On a side note, I was reading the journal of the guy currently winning the Autotrader championship. Two things were fascinating. #1- He always opens 2 trades from the get go (2.5 lots each). One with a profit target much bigger than the other. This is desinged to catch large moves, but take profit ASAP. #2- At a certain point, he keeps bumping his stop by 1 to 2 pips as the price inches up. On his very first trade, the original profit target was hit. On the second trade, the profit target was not hit, but on the stop-out he still bagged over $800. Here is the journal link: http://championship.mql4.com/2006/pa...iddy38/journal (Hey Palmer- where you been? Probably working under the hood of that kid of yours.

The other day she called us from Kuwait and it was 111. She mentioned something about wishing she was in Oregon in her poncho and golashes on the coast ; ) Phoenix? Still forward testing in two accounts 8 currency pairs...those w/JPY in the mix are doing well. Cheers, Thom

I guess as usual, the point of view is related to your point of reference. I spent some time working at Redmond, WA. So I guess now you would be coming up to the monsoon season. I spent the winter there, and it was either raining, it had just finished raining, or it was just about to start raining. Sunshine was a luxary item to be enjoyed on the rare glimpses that it offered.

The development of Phoenix 5 so far. Looking great! We have three different modes of operation: The classic one, the 123-method for those who want to play safe, and the second trade-method for the daredevils! Most bugs are fixed now. And the forward test....wow! Stay tuned!!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Harry: The EA contest is looking good for you, no matter what the end result is thanks for all of the work that has been put into this. Looking forward to helping out with P5. Hope all is well... Good trades to all.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Good to hear all is going well Hendrick. I'm sure you will amaze us all again as you already did before with your previous versions! Can't wait to set-up some more forward tests for you. Vince

Hi everyone, After I've read all msgs (man, you guys write a lot) - just kidding - I'm so glad I found you. Hendrick, thank you for all your hard work and the rest of the crew for testing, support and help. This is evolving into something great! [quote=saltcafe]No problem ... will continue running the demos on the previous version to compare results. /QUOTE] Great! This is something I was keep thinking every time I heard for new version. We need some kind of comparism with (at leats) the original, 'Contest' version - regardless how namy bugs it has. Since the original is not bad at all or it wouldn't be at the top of the contest. That way, you can see the progres in newer versions. And something else. Say new version just come out, we try it, we get in average say -300 pips and we conclude, nope, something is wrong with that one. Well, maybe market condittions were really bad, maybe original (Contest) version would have even biger loss - from that view point, new wersion would be sucessfull. So, my opinion is, that there should be few who are runnig some mayor 'old' versions for a longer period (half year?) and compare result with new versions. Maybe, unless not, of course : just my thought. I will try to do my share, but I'm first time user, all is confuzing and strange lol So, backtesting is (for now) beyong my abilities, but forward testing I can probably hanlde lol One quick beginner question. After I copied uncompiled version of expert (*.mq4) into 'experts' folder - this expert apeared inmediatelly in navigator. I tried and I could drag&amp;drop it onto chart and there was that smilling face - !without previous compile it!?! - is this normal? Anyway, just to be sure, I did follow the script, load it into Editor and compiled it, just to be sure, so I don't know if trades would be executed or not... Well, thanks again to all and specially to Hendrick. This group have big potential and I'm so glad I can be part of it. Mario

Hendrick Still having trouble to zip my files. Can you recommend a free zip program? Results for Phoenix from 15 Oct: Starting balance $5000 Equity now: $4093 - was below the waterline the whole time Float $213 - was below $500 the whole time Trading 15min charts: USDCHF, EURJPY, USDJPY, GBPJPY, CHFJPY I am testing the CONTEST version also, but results are negative.

What is wrong with post 361 on this thread? It answers your question there. You can always try others ... try the following in Google and see what it comes back with: "related:winzip.com". You should get more alternatives to WinZip then you have ever imagined.

any idea why the trailing stop doesnt work.i m tryin with 10 trail but in visual back test it does not move the stop. has phoenix 5 been released? fawaz

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hendrick will release P5 any time now. I asked him about the TS function and I believe he said it would alter the logic of the system so it may not be functional. I'm not sure if it will be incorporated into P5. Stay tuned...

OK, so i've got Phoenix running on a seperate IBFX demo account...I happen to let things roll over to the 1st of the month and wake up to see that the account balance has been taken down to zero (i saved the history the nite before for study). Now at the time there had already been three trades entered so i didn't want to rock the boat as the trades looked good (jpy pairs). Well i got up this morning to find that the balance is at +8202.47 from zero on the first with 6 trades closed, and a float of about -400. Wouldn't it be grand to have a money tree in the back yard? Hope you all picked up some of those ProDollarPips this morning! Have a great weekend. Thom

Congratulations!

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Ok. Version 5 of Phoenix is finished. Attached is the mq4 file and a pdf-file "SettingsAndHowToUsePhoenix56.pdf". For forward testing I think "Mode 3" is the best to start with. For now only the settings for the EURJPY, USDJPY and GBPJPY are coded. GBPJPY is my favorit. A lot of testing to be done. So let's go to work! (At this moment Phoenix is number one in the Contest. Yes, yes, yes!!)

Hi, I will setup 3 demo accounts with P5, I'm EURO ZONE trader. 1 at 1000$ 1 at 5000$ 1 at 25000$ Same broker. I will post results every Friday. Go Hendrick:-) Question to Hendrick: did i need to change every magic numbers if i test the 3 pairs by accounts ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Bravo Hendrick, you're at the top, and P4 achieve ATC "pool position". Congratulation and keep going... ! As my Mom used to sey "you can eat to the full with a small spoon too". I hardly believe that is only way to beat forex (on my level of course). Pavel ps. how you feeling with that ?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hi Pavel! With Phoenix 5 you can now choose the size of your spoon by choosing the right Mode of Phoenix. I think Mode 2 will fits you the best!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Hendrick, Nice job on Phoenix 5. I will be testing for the next week on the setup. However, I am confused as to which setup to use and the values. Little History: Last Sunday I started testing 4.2 and was using a settingphoenix2006_10_9.txt file for my values. I set the prefsettings=false on GBP/USD, EUR/USD, USD/CHF and USD/JPY and had a $14,664.02 profit of a $100,000 demo account. I did print out the pdf file explaining the setup for Phoenix 5 and have a couple of questions. 1. Do we use the prefsetting=true with the NEW VALUES as indicated by you? 2. I found the settingsphoenix2006_10_9.txt file have more detailed values for the INPUTS.... So...what do we do? If you have a chance can you help us with the setup screens? Nice to know you and enjoy the day, Scott ABQ, NM

--- 帖子 #502 ---
First of all congrats on the MQL contest, nice going. Looking though the trade history it seems that the EA has an amazing win rate, but the losers are 3x bigger that the winners. Two things spring to mind reading the code... 1. Why not calculate lot size on risk &amp; stop loss? this way max risk is actually max risk &amp; lot size increases on account size. 2. Have you considered a more refined MM approach (e.g. break evens etc)?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I have one quick beginner question, how do I delete past trades from 'Account History' tab? I think I read once somewhere, but don't know where and program Help didn't help me. Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Craig: Please have a look at the new Phoenix - P5! there a breakeven-option, I think. alamanjani: I think you can't delete anything. However, you could use the option (sth. linke "customize period") when you use a right-click in acc. hist.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Way to go Hendrick! We know you worked hard on this version. I hope you win the contest. 40g's is a lot of money. To the test lab!

Hello! From some time I'm interested in forex market from as a mathematician. Phoenix seems to be a very promising approximation of the market behaviour. In fact I'm quite surprised by the fact that the set of relatively simple indicators implemented proved to be very successful. I played for a while with a metatrader platform and it`s simulator, which seems to be far from perfect in it`s treating of time series. So in this situation forward test are more accurate. I currently work on custom tick-based simulator and expert advisor taking advantage of higher frequency signals to predict longer term trends using wavelet mathematics. And here comes my question. Many forward test on this list are conducted on demo platforms. This would be fine if the demo feed matches perfectly life data feed in its characteristics. For example: demo data feed can change more frequently and oscillate around slower true live feed. In this case indicator`s parameters tuned on faster data can function less effectively on slower data feed even when working with minute bars. For example data displayed on [link removed - forum rule #2] website changes slower than on NEXTT demo metatrader data feed. Hendrick, could you please tell us, whether data on NEXTT demo feed matches perfectly true live feed?

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Tradeigel, so there is, my apologies.

Hendrick Africa rejoices! We concratulate you on your no 1 position! Ben Cape Town

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hendrick Thank you very much for your hard work with Phoenix 5. I am sure this one will be the biggest surprise to us all! We are thankful that you allow us to help you. Just tell us what to do. It is no use for everyone to test the same settings. Give us a broad value for the settings and let us find the correct combinations. I am confused with the settings1 to 5. They are all zero except for setting4 with fast_price=1 and slow_price. Will you please tell us what settings should be used for settings1 to 5. Thanks! Ben

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi Ben, There will be a new manual for Phoenix (today or tomorrow) and I'm sure you will find all the answers in there.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
As far as I know, NEXXT and IBFX don't have (significant) differences between data feed for their live- and demo-accounts.

Hi, Personally I never close trades on Friday. As far as I known &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; can handle news events very well. Once I've witnessed that &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; opened and closed a trade during a spike in only 20 seconds. A profit of &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="1.700 in"&gt;1.700 in&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; 20 seconds. So, let this baby run 24 hours a day and don't worry about news events!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Also, gbpusd had good results. The first half of this demo trial had a steady profit growth. Most of the loses were in the last 2 weeks. As with most EAs, there are time periods when the EA is more in tune with the market. If I had only traded jpy pairs and gbpusd, I would be up $3,998.45. On a $10,000 starting deposit, this is ~40% ROI from only 6 weeks of trading. In my opinion, the profit return on this EA is a good as it gets. If Phoenix 5 is even better, then I think we will be very fortunate and very thankful to Hendrick and this forum group Wackena

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi Wackena! Very useful this summary! CHFJPY, EURJPY and USDJPY are behaving as expected. GBPJPY should be a winner, but from your results I think it needs to be tweaked again. The GBPUSD is a big surprise to me. Dropped it in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5, but now I will have a second look. Hope you will keep me posted with the results of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="5 in"&gt;5 in&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; the coming week. Thanks again!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; in.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Here are my results for about a month of trading use P4. The two accounts do not show the same results for some pairs. EURUSD would be a good example of this. The alpari test included less pairs as well. As is my usual luck the demo made money the baby live lost money. Alpari had feed problems a handful of times and IBFX had several shutdowns while I had it on a VPS. The one pair with NO LOSSES on Wackena's test and both of mine was CHFJPY. It did not trade often but if it can trade with low losses most months I'd love it. I also had fair results on GBPUSD. I did not do as well on EURJPY as expected. GBPJPY and USDJPY were ok. The test were run on 15 min charts. The PDFs include returns sorted by pairs followed by the original statements and then the settings from the EA in use.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Great thread here. Thanks Hendrick and congrats. What are the recommended settings for v5? TP, SL, etc.? I am going to forward test this week and would really be grateful for any advice you and everyone else could give. Thanks

Hi Wackena, what leverage is your NF broker account using? Or it doesn't matter? Rgds, ed

--- 帖子 #522 ---
An updated version of Phoenix 5 (version 5.6.02). - we now have the follwing pairs: USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY, USDCHF, GBPUSD. - to avoid mistakes in choosing the right mode, there is now only one parameter for this : PhoenixMode . Classic mode=1, SencondTrade mode=2 and 123 mode=3 (thanks Herbert). - MicroAccount was still not working. Changed the code as suggested by lgvh. Manual for Phoenix is updated.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hey Hendrix Correct me if I'm wrong. If I just load up this version and change nothing, it will trade according to the code? This version is set at code 3, but with pref settings set at true it ignores it right. ????? TX Kevin

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi Hendrick, great to see you still putting so much effort into Phoenix. But, it's understandable - 1st place in world championship WOW! I think you so deserve the 1st place and the 40k! Wouldn't that be great?

1:100 leverage standard Demo account. I don't believe leverage will effect win/loss ratio, except to the point where there are insufficient funds to place order. Wackena

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi Kevin, It's all in the manual Kevin! With PrefSettings=true it takes part of the settings directly from the code (see manual) but you still have to manual set the PhoenixMode parameter if you want something else than mode 3.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hi Hendrick If the market open over the stop lost, For example: The market closed at 1.2650...you have a buy at 1.2600 and a stop at 1.2550 and the market reopen on sunday at 1.2400 (Big news like 9/11 or Sadam captured ect.) In this event, I think the stop lost is burn! and you will have to closed your trade manually if your account is not burst. Tell me if I'M wrong! Thank again and congratulations on your first place at the contest. Good lock again.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
It depends on the broker but 99% the broker will close your position. If it is on interbank (ecn) it will stay open.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
With a StopLoss of 84 and a MaximumRisk of 0.05 there's nothing to worry about! Of course there is always an "if". What if this and what if that. You don't know what will happen int he future. That's Forex!

The PHOENIX EA seems me very exciting Expert. But, which time frame may I use this??? 15 min is the best !???

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hendrick, Should the first trade in each mode on the same pair open at the same time? Can we run P5 in more than one mode on the same pair, (using a different chart), in the same account? If we can't skip the rest of this post. Is there a problem running mode 1 and mode 2 on the same pair in the same account in P5? In two different demo accounts I tried running all three modes at the same time to see what would happen. On both accounts it can't seem to open all 3 first trades. I attached the experts and journal tab log files.

Setup yesterday and so far pretty good results. I am trading in mode 3 and did have a few positions closed out although they were no where near the Stop/loss. It closed out the second and third positions. Overall I am very happy with the early results but wonder about those closed trades. thanks

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Harry: I saw in the trade log that the first trade was closed ( we have a winner! ) and listed as 'Trade 1' in the comment field, or something like that, will there be a running list, like Trade 2, Trade 3,......for all trades? Easy to keep track of it all, great stuff.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Goodness me! Can't leave you guys alone for 3 days can I ;-) Just got back from a trip and I thinks there are at least 50 new posts! Great! Good to see &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is kicking up so much dust! First of all congrets Hendrick! Very well done! Both on the competition and on &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5 of course! Will spend the next few hours setting up various MT4's for testing. Probably have to close some of the tests I was still running on version 4_2_03... It's getting 'a bit' busy on my desktop (will post final results of those tests soon too). Most likely will set up tests to run in Neuimex and NorthFinance. Will keep everyone posted! Thanks again! Vince &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Was trade 1 negative? Look at page 7 under mode3: in the instruction PDF which was in post #522. It explains trades 2 and 3 will be closed based on trade 1s pip loss. I think.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thanks for your reply. Just reread and it does take out 2 and 3 when a certain number of pips are lost on 1. Thanks

Hi, first day with Phoenix 5 P5 Open with the market this week (Sunday evening, here in EU). Account 30K -&gt; P5 in Mode 3, standard settings... On another account of 1K, 10,2% profit in 1 day... Great start... Let's run to see now...

--- 帖子 #550 ---
my Phoenix is doing great right now, too. However, Mondays are usually good for Phoenix...

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi all, please find attached the last forward test results I will be posting of Phoenix 4.2_03. As discussed b4, quite a bit of difference between different brokers. I'll leave you to make any conclusions. Will focus my tests on the new Phoenix from now on. KR, Vince

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Does it means, it's perhaps better to close manually the trades of Monday if they are a lot of positive ? Or just wait ? Thanks for answer.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Wackena, are you using your preferred settings (v4.2.03 SETTINGS.doc) or just default? Using Mode 3? Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Well done Hendrick, fantastic perseverance. Thank you again for making your hard work available to everyone.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Best wishes,&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; blewmoon &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Just default as provided by Hendrick for Phoenix 5.6.02. Wackena

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hendrick is in 1st place again in the 2006 ATC. As discussed with Hendrick before, if we had understood that the contest rules would allow mulitple orders to be open at same time, Hendrick would have submitted an EA like Phoenix 5.6. If Hendrick had an EA in the contest that would open 2-3 orders at same time with 4-5 lot size per order, he would be way out in 1st place. Hendrick has 15 wins so far in the contest averaging ~$1,700 per win. Current equity is $23,733. If had 2-3 orders opening at same time, equity would be over $37,000 (2 orders) or $54,000 (3 orders). Just think how difficult this EA Forex trading is and be grateful for what Hendrick has freely given to us. Wackena

--- 帖子 #557 ---
I have been testing for a few days and am pleased with the early result. It seems to me that it gets me in profit early and closes out some 1st postions but seems that the second and third will take some time. I closed out a few postions early and I wonder if anyone else testing are closing some early if they start to turn? Here are some early results. http://ss.gamers4jesus.com/Report1.htm

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Well I finally got my computer built and internet issues all ironed out (at least for the time being) so I began testing Phoenix 5.6 mode 3 on Sundays open. So far so good. I am a little positive. Sorry Hendrick that it took me so long to get going. I'll post more detailed findings in a couple of days and I'm also playing around with a few different settings before I start another foward test.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
it does open three trades and puts stop at BE after closing first trade. is there any other criteria for closing the remaining 2 trades like TS or its just TP. its doing well on USDJPY i m live with FXDD. fawaz

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hendrick, First of all congrats on being in 1st Place in the contest. All of us appreciate your hard work. The preliminary posts of forward testing are very promising and I am beginning my forward testing today. I have been looking through the code casually...believe me I am no programmer... and noticed that the preferred settings for the USDGBP OSMA Fast=23 and the OSMASlow=17. Is this correct or should they be reversed? One other thing which would help us less intelligent people help you in testing your EA is to explain in greater detail in your manual exactly how the EA works. A good start to this explanation would be your contest interview where you explain the principle on which Phoenix is based. A more detailed explanation in layman's terms outlining the envelope and how the SMA's and OSMA's and how the settings interact with them to determine entry and exit points, etc. would help solidify our understanding. In addition, indicators of the envelope, MA's and divergence, showing these points of entry/exit would provide a graphical picture to the method. You know what they say...a picture is worth a thousand words... Again, let me say thanks for this great opportunity to allow me to test your very promising EA. 1Trader2

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Is there a site we can access to follow the trading results on the Contest? I sure would like to give it a look. thanks.

Hi, The OSMA Fast=23 and the OSMA Slow=17 is correct. In my previous posts I emphasized that I don't care about "classic rules". If back testing shows a better result with OASMA Fast &gt; OSMA Slow then so be it. I'm not rejecting these settings because everyone else says that it should be the other way! I love to think (and behave) "outside the box".&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I will try to make a new manual with a more extensive explanation about the use of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. But I need more time!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

What is the meaning of the following functions in Phoenix 5: TrailingStop BreakEven CloseAfterhours We first start with Phoenix 5 in Mode 1 without any other settings. Backward test for the USDJPY from 2006.04.01 until 2006.11.03: Net Profit 19.883 Trades 122 Maximal Drawdown (MD) 7.16%. Second: TrailingStop=35 Net Profit 21.100 Trades 136 MD 6.79% Third: BreakEven=38 Net Profit 21.023 Trades 131 MD 6.90% Fourth: CloseAfterHours=132 Net Profit 18.997 Trades 126 MD 7.38% And now let's combine these 3 and we get: Net Profit 21.997 Trades 139 MD 6.64% So, it helps to use these settings to improve your results.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hendrick - Thank you very much for all the time you have spent developing Phoenix and sharing your thoughts. In your opening post, you mentioned adjusting the preferred settings in Phoenix via backtesting every two weeks. You also mentioned that you backtest over a six month period. I would be interested in knowing whether particular variables tend to change (and thus must be re-optimized) as you backtest and whether reoptimization typically involves small or large changes in the variable settings.

Heres the guy responsible for Phoenix. Read the interview about Phoenix here: http://championship.mql4.com/2006/news/43 We appreciate it, Harry! (Hey Palmer, I like that retirement fund graph. At that rate it would take what, 2 1/2 weeks?)

Hello, I am trading an IBFX Mini Account. I had good results with Phoenix_4.2_02.mq4 during the last 3 weeks. My account balance is now 12300 (from 10000) Today I will start trading with the version 5 of phoenix. I set the maximum risk to 0.3, the chart is USD/JPY 15 minutes. I want to change the lots size. It is now opening 3 trades of size 1.2, but I want the size of the lots to be 10x more (12 instead of 1.2) I've tried to change the value of the external variable Lots from 1 to 10 but it doesn't make any difference. Maybe somebody can help, thanks....

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Nevermind, I think I have the answer. If MM is set to true, then Lots is ignored. sorry

--- 帖子 #576 ---
MM will decide the size of your lots depending on your risk. If MM does not open 10 lots, that means you don't have enough balance to handle the risk level set using that lot size. If you want to open bigger lots you may: turn MM off and decide lot size by yourself OR leave MM on but increase your risk level. Hope this helps!

Looking so far at the results of the Contest version of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; I have to say that I’m a bit surprised that it’s performing so well. But on the other hand it’s showing the same results as seen in the backward testing, so I shouldn’t be surprised at all! (Backward testing in MT4 is a very powerful tool)&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; We have now 20 closed trades; &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="17 in"&gt;17 in&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; profit and &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="3 in"&gt;3 in&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; loss. The starting Balance of 10.000 has increased to &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="27.183 in"&gt;27.183 in&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; 5 weeks. And that’s a good result for an EA.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Another thing is that there are no consecutive losses. Very important! Also no signs that the parameters should be adjusted. First I thought that these adjustments should be made every two weeks. Looking at the Contest version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; however I think it can wait. First sign to change the parameters will be if there are consecutive losses.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Some of you have posted their results of forward testing. Thanks a lot for these and please continue to do so because your results are very valuable to me. I collect them all. But I need more! And what I need most is your ideas about how to improve &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; in the future. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I think I will add just one more Mode to &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. I’m now working on a variation of the “123 Mode”. This will be a mode with a lot of trades but with a Maximal Drawdown below the 5%. Very cool!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; So, come on guys. Tell me what you think about &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, your ideas, your results, your criticism, your I don’t know what, but post it!!!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Hi Hendrick Again, Congratulation and thanks for sharing your EA with us! I try Phoenix Contest in my demo account, but it doesn't work the same like your trade in http://championship.mql4.com/2006/participants/Hendrick/ If I'm not mistaken, Phoenix Contest use SMA 7 and 14 in 15 mnts time frame for USDJPY. I wonder what's wrong.. Could you help me please? Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi Hendrick. Just wanted to say congratulations on creating this great EA. I also wanted to thank you for your unselfishness by posting it for us. I just started to read the thread yesterday and I immediately downloaded the most recent version after I saw the kind of results that you were getting, and i'm demoing it as I type. The moment I get some reults for it, I will post it here to provide you some feedback. So far I am in the green for everything. Thanks again Jon

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Please be more specific! I can't help you if you don't give more details!!! What have you done so far, what are your results. Why do you think Phoenix is using a SMA 7 and 14??

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hi Jon, Keep us posted with your results!

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hendrick Congratulations with Phoenix current success! I am new to EA's but would like to learn. I have started with backtesting on USDJPY - downloaded file from Alpari and installed according to your manual. The modelling quality on 1M for the last 6 months is 23% but 5M and higher is 90%- on closer inspection I found random gaps in the data string. For example 30October06 21h00 to 22h00 more than twenty minutes out of this hour is not present...randomly. I did a few spot checks and this appears to be one of the "bad" hours. The most seem to be missing anything up to 10 minutes per hour. Is this normal? or did I download a corrupt file?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Palmer!! That's not honest. I gave you that picture in private and asked you to keep it confidential! And now you posted it in this thread. For the next two months I will refuse to look at any strawberry that crosses my path. That will teach you! &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hi Hendrick, thanks for replying my message I don't know what's SMA that you use for Phoenix Contest. I thought you use SMA 7 and 14 because I read in the code : SMAPeriod = 7; SMA2Bars = 14; Percent = 0.0032; TakeProfit = 42; StopLoss = 84; TrailingStop = 0; OSMAFast = 5; OSMASlow = 30; OSMASignal = 2; EnvelopePeriod = 2; Fast_Period = 25; Slow_Period = 15; DVBuySell = 0.003; DVStayOut = 0.024; If the SMA is not 7 and 14, mind telling me the correct SMA please? Thank you Kind Regards PS: Please forgive my bad English..

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hi, I really don't know if this normal or not. So far I haven't any problems with the history data for the M15 for my backward tests. Anyone else?&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hi, Hendrick! Thanks a lot for your EA! As I have noticed,you had changed the settings for EUR/JPY in Phoenix 5, and the settings for other currencies are the same as in Phoenix 4. Are these new settings better than those in Phoenix 4? What is your opinion, how often the optimization of parameters should be carried out? What is the period for optimization,last 6 months? I've have also backtested other currencies, USD/CHF and EUR/JPY showed great results like USD/JPY did. Is it OK to put them on real account? Thanks for help!

Hi Bellefemme (what a beautiful nickname!)&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Your English is certainly not worse than mine. As long as we understand each other it's ok!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I now understand what you mean with SMA 7 and 14. These values are only valid for the USDJPY. The other pairs have other values. If you want to test the USDJPY (great pair for &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;!) then these values are ok.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Keep us posted with your results!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Following is a question (and suggestion) I would like to share with you all. Today I started forward testing P5.2 Mode 3 (Hendrick we can't ever stop thanking you). I set the EA on all possible pairs that were listed in Hedrick's manual. a few hours later I was 100 pips ahead (I was positive on some pairs and negative on other pairs) Non of the EA charts reached a stop loss or take profit. A few hours later I was down close to $0 and now I'm back on $80+ My understanding is that if we close all trades (winning and loosing) every time we reach a total amount of X positive pips on all charts combined together (for example 100) we would be able to SAVE LOTS OF TIME on our "money machine". At the end of the day statistically we would be making the same amount of money during the same amount of trades but now we are trading much more so we are making more money. I know Hendrick set an option for closing trades after a certain amount of time so this would actually be going in a similar direction (trying to close slow trades and start new ones) but it would have a broader statistical look at all open positions (the general portfolio) and we would be looking at positive pips rather then time that elapsed. The logic behind this suggestion is that the market has some hours/days that it doesn't fit the average daily mileage of pips (long or short) and just goes up and down in a narrow range without closing profits or losses, this solution would be able to catch those days too without hurting the general trading system and it's risk/reward ratio. I may do some testing on this but wanted to hear your opinions before (maybe someone tried this or addressed this before and I missed it on the thread) What do you all think? Thanks in advance for any feedback, Reuven

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Henrick, Attached is list of open trades. Until the last position was opened, gbp/jpy, profit was 150+ in 4hrs. Thats fantastic. Question I have is should the trades be closed now or should I let the program close them. I'm concerned that some or all will reverse before profit levels are triggered and total profit maybe less than what it is now. Thanks, for the EA.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I installed the EA, it shows up in the list, but when I drag it into the chart, nothing...could somebody please let me know what I am missing... Thank you

--- 帖子 #594 ---
There is a button at the top right next to "new order". It says "Expert Advisors". Make sure it is checked and green, not red.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Harry- Hard to critisize it. Lets give it about 2-4 weeks before any trends show up that can be improved upon. How about spreading around the 40g's you are going to win so we can use your money also with Phoenix? (I didn't think so but thought I would ask anyway)

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Thank you so much for your quick reply. I made sure it is green. I have downloaded other EAs before (Vegas tunel, Bagovino, etc....) and they all work. I dont get it. Does it work will all pairs? I am trying with GBPUSD.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
It requires v5_6.3 to use the gpd/usd. It was posted by Hendrick not too long ago. Check the posts by Hendrick and you will find it. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Still nothing, sorry....but thank you for helping.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Steve, are you selecting allow live trading. Also are you turning on the EA above the chart. You should create your chart and drag the EA onto the chart and check proper settings. If you are doing all this then I am sorry for repeating it.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
who is your broker. I can,t get it to work either on CFG

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I am using it within MetaTraders demo account, is that why it is not working?

--- 帖子 #602 ---
It will work with a demo account. A demo account is the best place to run a new EA while testing it. Were you expecting it to display information on the chart like an indicator? It will not. It is not an indicator. It's purpose is to place trades. I have used the Vegas tunnel custom indicator. Do they have an EA also? How many hours in a row have you ran the EA? If you are running it on one pair it could take a while possibly more than one day before it places the first trade or group of trades.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
These are my P5 test results for three days. The mode 1 - Alpari test has old Phoenix trades in the statement. I left the comment fields on so all the tests would be easier to follow. All setting at default on 15min charts.

Now I understand.. Thanks Hendrick But I am a bit confused now.. Your trade in championship phoenix contest set 'sell' http://i13.tinypic.com/2nsnmf4.jpg But in my chart it sets 'buy' http://i14.tinypic.com/4ibegyx.jpg Which one is correct? Hehe.. sorry if its too many questions.. Kind Regards

Here are my results for the week so far, but I am puzzled as to why I don't seem to be getting the same results as others. Perhaps when I started and the settings? I'm using Phoenix v5.6.02 with default settings and Mode 3.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Hello Celine, your results are quite the same as mine (I have an ibfx account). I think you could try to make your lots size larger and change the MaximumRisk from 0.05 (default value) to something like 0.3..

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Thank you Hendrick for this excellent EA. What is your criteria to go live on any EA. Thank you for your EA, u deserve the 40 grand.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hi Hendrick, I've just about finished catching up on the previous posts in your very active (and hard to keep up with) thread. First off congratulations regarding Phoenix's performance in the contest, although I'm not too surprised. Secondly, your comment about some people who contacted you a while ago struck me - because I'm one of them - and I wanted to let you know that I'm not simply a taker.... I recently got a new duo core and yes it is quite a fast monster. As it worked out, at the time my brother and another close friend of ours were (and still are) very hard at work backtesting another system which we designed. As you know these EA's take a lot of processor time and so as a result Phoenix dropped off of my worktable for a bit. I have been following your progress and wanting to help out in some way when a window of opportunity arose. I'd like to help and support in some way - but first I'll get caught up on your rapid progress. This is without question my favorite thread on fxfactory and you and the entrie crew here have my best respect and best wishes for success. Yours, Joe

Hi Hendrick, I have been demoing the latest version of Phoenix for a little over 24 hours and the results have been unbelievable!!!! I have booked a total of 287 pips. I have not had one single losing trade. This is amazing! Unbeleivable job, Hendrick. Im gonna post my statement. In the statement, I have some other trades so dont get confused. All the phoenix trades have a lot size of .80 lots. Just look at those ones. Also, the demo which is a standard account, would i have to tweak anything in the inputs if I wanted to play this using mini lots. I know the latest version has a paramater which lets you put true for micro accounts. Im just not sure if micro and mini are the same thing. Im not sure if I would have to put true on that field for it to work correctly on mini accounts. Im still somewhat of a newbie. Anyways, just an incredible job all around.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hi, Can you please post your settings and the version you are testing.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Im only using the given settings that were already programmed for mode 3. I didnt change anything.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Can somebody pleaseeeee assist me? I do not understand why nothing happens when I insert the EA....

--- 帖子 #613 ---
steve are u seeing smiley face on the upper right hand corner of the chart that u attach it to?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Steve, could it be you have placed your EA in the wrong folder. It should be in experts. Not in indicators.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Thank you soooo much!! That's exactly what I did. I am sorry I wasted everybodies time with my ignorance. I did have it in: C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators and moved it into : C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts And it works now!!! Thank you all.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Nothing to said... except Hendrick you're Rock :-) Current lasts trades (just for today...) - forgot the eurusd : it's a manual trade... Tomorrow or sathurday i will post result for 25K account and 1K account. {image removed, please repost 600x600 max}

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Not a problem, steve. I think many of us have done that before.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Glad to be of help Steve.

Let’s talk about the differences between manual trading and trading with an automated trading system like &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. What makes a manual trader a successful trader? I think a successful trader has developed his own strategy and he will stick to this strategy whatever happens. He doesn’t get upset when there are a couple of loosing trades because he knows that in the end the winning trades will have the upper hand. He trusts his strategy for a 100%!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; The same counts for an Expert Advisor. You’ve tested it backwards and forward, tried it on several demo-accounts and it turned out to be very successful. So, one day you decided to put this EA on a live account. And then you started to lose your faith. Sitting all day in front of your screen, closing trades by hand as soon as your trades are a couple of pips in profit (greed) or closing trades that are a couple of pips in loss (fear). Instead of letting the EA do its work (as a successful manual trader) you interfere with your human shortcomings. And after a week or so you decide to drop the EA because it’s not making any profit.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; A lot of suggestions were made on how to improve &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. I have to say that most of these suggestions are based on the same shortcomings as mentioned above, greed and fear.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; My advise: test the different modes with different pairs, make a choice, do your backward and forward testing for a couple of weeks and if you’re 100% confident about its performance, then you go live. That decision is all yours!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I received several e-mails from people who lost all their money with manual trading. Now they want to try &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and asked me to guide them. No way! I’m sure these people will still loose money when using &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. It’s all about self-confidence and knowledge of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. Without it you’re condemned to loose!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I think &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; has only one problem: it’s based on settings that had been optimized for the last 6 months. If there is a strong turn in the behavior of a pair &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; can start to make more loosing than winning trades. First sign of this is when you get consecutive losses. Then it’s time to stop &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. I’m now trying to find out when these turns occur and which settings will have to be adjusted to get &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; again on the right track. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #623 ---
So next step is ... making Phoenix adaptive and implement some sort of walk forward optimization ... that's a BIG challenge ! May the odds be with you !!

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Am I to assume that you're the same Idamiani who's in the trading champsionship as well? Anyways, as far as Phoenix goes, I'm finding that I'm getting better results on my demo account with Phoenix running in mode 1 over the others. While running in classic mode, it's cleaning house. Mode 3's "easy-out" losses just keep dragging things down, hurting the average. Then again, this is only my mileage, your mileage may vary.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I am just curious, I had it running all day, but only one trade executed. If we all use the same EA, should we all have the same results? Which trades have been excecuted for you? Maybe I am doing something wrong. Thank you all.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
PipSteve: Different brokers have different data-feeds/speeds/execution timing blah blah blah. So, everyone's results will differ with different brokers. SkyHook; Got the email with the indicators for the range breakout thingamabobjoggyEA. I'm going to look at some previous charts with your targets and see what I can see. Matty: sssup dude... Harry: Suggestions/feedback about Phoenix...that's a hard one. I'm going to brush up on some 'envelope theory' to see how that works first. Everyone can see an indicator on a chart as being overbought, but how is the indicator formulated and what is it really telling you about price action???? So, I'll groove into the envelopes... Here I am with FXDD and minis. I have to do this in Excel because I have two other EA's running......Is it me or is FF really slowwwwwwww right now?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
yep ... are you too?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
In case you are the one... Hendrix is here sharing his knowledge and we are helping with forward testing to make it better as you already know. Any chances you are planning to do the same?

Not much, Palmer. Wishing I was in a tropical paradise somewhere trading the Forex wirelessly on a beach.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi Babarmughal, Just check the very first post's attachhment of this thread. The idea is to use the first post for the latest updates. ed

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Guess who is @ no1 again?!? :-)

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hey Palmer, Did you have to change any of the default paramaters in the phoenix version that you are using, due to it being a mini instead of a standard account? I have been demoing on a mini account of $3000 and it is only playing .10 mini lots, which doesnt seem like the correct % that it should be playing. Just curious. Thanks Jon

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Can someone point me to the latest link to download Phoenix? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hi all. Backward/Forward testers of FB5 : Which mode of FB did you prefer, in terms of $$$ return or protected account ? Mode1, Mode2 or Mode3 ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Can I perhaps suggest you read through the WHOLE thread b4 asking please..? I know it's a lot of posts but believe me, it's gonna b worth your time! Also you will get a better feel for this EA instead of just smacking it on a chart and wait for 'it' to do something. Lastly it saves us having to answer the same questions over and over again too. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hey Jac28403, I had the same problem. I've added the code lot = lot * 10; before the code if(MM==false) lot=Lots; if(AccountIsMicro==true) lot=lot/10; return(lot); in the function LotsOptimized(). Recompile it...et voila but I am sure we can find a better workaround...

--- 帖子 #638 ---
my second statement in 3days,net about 500pips but,the 3days i test is not a continuous 72 hours ,i open it onlt in the (12:00-16:00 and 18:00-24:00 GMT+8) not a continuous test is also a good result even better than my first statement which is open it 72h continuos. i will test it next week.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hi Spillsome, Thanks for the quick reply. I tried to look for the code in the script but couldnt find it. Im totally brainless when it comes to programming. It minus well be written in latin. Would it be possible for you to post your phoenix version with that change? Thanks Jon

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Jac28403, I will send it to your email because I don't want to post my own version of Phoenix on this forum. Hendricks might not appreciate that different versions are floating around...

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hendrick was kind enough to incorperate the best and most current settings into his Phoenix. If you want to have a look at what they are, all you need to do is open the EA in MetaEditor and you can find all settings for each supported currency pair. Enjoy

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hi all, I have been following this tread with great interest, and I am amazed how helpful everybody is here. I am using the EA with each pair that is coded for in it, I left it on all night, but no trades were executed. Do I need to modify any settiongs? I am using the default Metatrader demo account, and I am in the eastern time zone, in case that matters. Thank you

--- 帖子 #645 ---
I loaded mine in the one hour chart, could that be the problem?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
My conclusion so far about the Phoenix Modes: Mode 1 and 2 are OK (even a combination of these 2). Mode 3 sucks. So I want to drop Mode 3 in favour of a new Mode (much better). Any objections?

--- 帖子 #647 ---
The data-feed of some brokers for demo-accounts are worthless. It’s no use testing an EA like Phoenix if you can’t trust the data-feed for demo-accounts. One of my micro-account demo's at www.realtrade.lv shows completely different trades than my other demos. Please give me some feedback about brokers that have no (significant) differences between data-feed for their demo- and live-accounts. I have excellent experiences with NEUIMEX. Some of you mentioned North Finance. Any more?

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Please read the WHOLE thread before asking!!!

--- 帖子 #649 ---
If only people would read the manual ... it says in there to attach it to 15 mins charts for the currency pairs that Phoenix has settings for.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
... perhaps Hendrick need to create a special thread called : "Phoenix 5 for Dummies" ... I agree, people must read before ask stupid questions....

--- 帖子 #651 ---
This problem has been a subject more than once in this thread. To solve this for once and for all I opened a micro-account demo at www.realtrade.tv . (they have demo-accounts for micro accounts) and Phoenix worked as it should be for micro-accounts. There is no need to change the code. Please give me some feedback on this.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hi Hendrick, mode3 doesn't work that great, I agree! Let's drop it. However, it looked nice to have 200 pips in one trade on USDCHF! Please keep us posted about your new idea to use a combination of Mode2 and Mode1. Congrats on your first place! That's so great!

--- 帖子 #653 ---
PipSteve: Run P5 on the 15 min charts. Make sure that you look under the Tools -&gt; Options menu and have EA's enabled under the ExpertAdvisors tab, don't worry we've all been there. MT4 has a lot to learn... jac28403: Settings: Mode=1 Lots =0.1 MaxR=.05 MM=True DecFactor=0 MicroAcct=False PrefSettings=True CloseAfterHours=0 BEAfterPips= 30 TS= 30 Harry: is that break even and TS set at 30 going to corrupt the logic???

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Thank you very much Palmer. I noticed that the latest version posted is 4.02. How far back do I need to go to get P5? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I'm running P5 from post #522....

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Thank you very much for your help. To all others, I am sorry, by the time I was done reading everything twice, my ADD kicked in, and I forgot again. Not just an excuse, I really have memory problems.....sorry.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Howdy Harry! Well I guess you probably know my opinion about mode3 :-) I wouldn't drop it just yet.. Based on this weeks forward tests I ran, I think it's not as bad as you might think it is. Mode 3 is outperforming the other modes at the moment.. This is on a NF account. Was planning on posting my findings 2night after the close of the market but will do it now already. It shows all 3 modes, both on Neuimex and on NF. I know the results are only from demo accounts but still... (takes bloody ages for me to go live... will keep you posted!) Just a thought about my good results with mode 3... I did use a relative small starting balance so the results might have been influenced by Phoenix not opening as much trades as it might have done with more 'breathing space'/bigger margin. Any thoughts? On the matter of using the time filter again (as you used in Firebird) I think this might be a good idea. But I must add I'm still convinced &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; can be profitable running 24h a day.. CU Vince&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Me again ... I wanted to ask you about the LotsOptimized function. I've noticed that it hasn't changed much since last version, still based on AccountFreeMargin(). What I have been thinking about is what are you thoughts about making it based on AccountEquity()? If you trade this EA on the full set of currencies then you may have up to 12 orders open (in v4.2). No objections to that, in fact it's quite good as it gives you diversification over the pairs, and when there is no major market moves then orders come and go and the lot size remains fairly constant between orders. The margin remains at around 150%-200%. However when you get major days like NFP then the market swings wildly and it make take out your half of your orders and all of a sudden your margin jumps up to 500%-700% and then when you take on new orders you unnecessarily take on larger lot sizes (larger risk) when your account hasn't actually grown in equity to justify a larger position. Now if your orders actually TP then your are sweet, but if your orders SL, then you are loosing equity unnecessarily which you wouldn't have if you based your MM on equity. This behavior of the EA is especially apparent when you start up with a clean account where your margin is maximum because you have no open orders. What does everybody think about this? This would also mean that your MaximumRisk setting would actually reflect the account value, which is what you had probably intended?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
I think the TPs for Mode 3 are too big. My &lt;st1:city w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; seems to perform better using 30-40 TPs with this mode. During this week many profitable trades turned to negative. I think this is because with Mode 3 Phoenix does not close trades when it should. Also, the 3-at-once trades are really messing for me, especially trading with 5 pairs. I stick with Mode 1. I love to see the "clean" trading history of &lt;st1:city w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; in the Championship: 1 trade at the time, 1 pair, everything organized and an excellent performance.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hi Palmer! Setting TS and BreakEven will not corrupt the logic. But these parameters have to be set right to get the most out of it! For witch pair do you want to use it? If I know the pairs you're using I will do some tests to find the right settings for TS and BreakEven. Strawberries rules!!!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #664 ---
You can visit both!! I support both with the same information.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hi Vince (my favourit tester)!! Looking at your results I think we have to give Mode &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="3 a"&gt;3 a&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; second thought! So maybe we should keep Mode 3 for those who really want to use it and add Mode 4 (oh boy, this one really rocks!!) as an extra. All in favor? Ok, proposal accepted.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Please give Salty some feedback on this!!

--- 帖子 #667 ---
I'm doing the same Pabloski! Dropped Mode &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="3 in"&gt;3 in&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; favour of Mode 1 (the good old Classic Phoenix). But I'm also trying Mode 2! Very good so far. Some of you are even trying to combine Mode 1 with Mode 2 with spectacular results. Have you tried this combination?&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hendrick, don't always put us in suspense! That's not nice ... What's the deal about Mode4, is that 1 and 2 combined? Maybe, Mode4 has a better r:r, too. Because I still don't like the feeling about the losses beeing twice as big as the winners.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Believe you me, still have the good old version kicking 'you know what' too! ;-) Still have some MT4's running 24/5 for forward tests on the old versions. (10 in total at the moment, hihi (I know, I know, I should get a life!)) Guess which pairs are still doing wel ;-) Damn do I like this EA! Good weekend to all! Vince

--- 帖子 #670 ---
I 'll surely try it next week. Personally, in Mode 2 i 'd like to open the 2nd trade with the same TP than the 1 first one. For example, if I have a 42 pips TP for the 1st trade, open the 2nd trade when the 1st is +21 with the same TP. If profitable, that would sum 63 pips.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Mode 4 is very special! It's not a combination of Mode 1 and 2. It's.... well very different! Look at the Contest. What do you see? &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; in the top ten (as long as it takes!) out of 260 Expert Advisors. It's now even at the first place. Why? Because it's a good EA. Why is it a good EA? I won’t tell you because that's my little secret. Look at the code and try to understand why the Contest version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is performing that well. You will not find it in the code! Why? Once again it's my little secret. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; The next version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; (version 2007) will be a rocket! Will it be available to the public? No! Why not? Because I think all me efforts, all these hundreds of hours I spent developing it should finally pay off. Do you think I'm selfish? No, I don't think so. Look at the Contest, only a few of the competitors made their EA available to the public. You have &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; 5. It's not posted as an ex4.file so you're free to do with it whatever you like (not for commercial purposes because it's still copyrighted). &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Now you can shoot at me!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Harry: I have these settings for the GBPUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and EURJPY. You can see on the chart the flat-line trades where the break-even was hit. I noticed that one trade I entered twice for the graph. The other three, looking at the chart, were sells because of a quick spike down. Those three trades look like they we be back to even, one with a small loss (floating) but are now closed at even...Even if the trade is closed to soon with a break even target, I'm fine with that. This gives P5 another opportunity to 'work'....

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Yes, you are exactly correct. This is your hard earned talentand effort and you should be compensated to what ever the market will support.. You certainly earned it.. I hope and believe it will make you millions...

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I think it sounds like a good idea to me. Unfortunately I'm rather useless in coding and understanding all that stuff :-( But the way you explained it, it does make sense to me...&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Maybe this could be incorporated as on option in future, as hinted upon in the other forum, so we could see the difference in action and decide what works best for every individual..

--- 帖子 #675 ---
No body gonna shoot you ! You are very kind and generous by sharing your knowledge with us ! Thank you Yes, I think you deserve to keep your secret If you are willing to share the secret, you are not a human.. but an angel Would you sell your latest Phoenix (the best version maybe) ? If it is.. please don't sell it too expensive so then a simple person like me will be able to buy I believe many people willing to buy your EA. Viva Phoenix! Viva Hendrick!

--- 帖子 #676 ---
It's all good Hendrick. You kind of gave a heads up on where you thought Phoenix might go some weeks ago with the "would somebody pay me for this?" post. What you might think of including in the marketing for the EA is including of course the Championship results/ranking, and also include actual account spreadsheets from forward tests. This forward test data would be a refreshing change from those EAspammers out there that only give backtesting results. As always, best wishes, and continuted good fortune in the championships. Thom

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hendrick, I won't be shooting at you. I am very thankful for all you have already done for us. I hope the new improvements will turn out great. I love how the contest is going too. Of interest to backtesters: I don't usually upgrade to a new build of MT for a while because I fear bugs in their new releases. I am using MetaQuotes MT4 build 199 now on one demo because you can download history data from within the history center. The info goes back to 1999. The button is in the lower left hand corner. I have not tested the overall quality of the data.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hendrix, I second upper statement. You deserve pay for your hard work and efforts. Since I'm not able to make money on my own in Forex, I would also be interested in buying your EA (if you ever decide to start selling it) if not to expensive.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Well, Hendrick, interesting answer.... You probably know how I think about you and Phoenix - I showed up in the very early development of Phoenix, when Firebird was re-discovered. Hopefully, you will win the first price in the competition, that's definitely a great reward for your efforts. However, since Phoenix is really that great, why would you sell it? I think you wouldn't do that, I wouldn't do that either, I would let it work for me (so that's enough reward if it's good). The EAs which are sold normally don't really work...because: why would the developers sell them? To get even more money? Probably not. So if I'm right and you're not actually selling Phoenix 2007, how are you not making it public, if you believe in sharing, which you do...Just giving it to persons which you consider to be helpful for the development? And: you mean there're already parts of Phoenix '07 in Phoenix-Contest? Please don't get me wrong, I am not trying to devaluate your work and effort!

Well, I use EAs to make money. It's reasonable that you create EAs (in fact modify EAs, as you created "&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;" from "Firebird") also to make money. You say " Will it be available to the public? No! Why not? Because I think all me efforts, all these hundreds of hours I spent developing it should finally pay off. ". The only way I found that something will not be available for the public and will pay off at the same time is by selling it, right? I agree with Tradeigel that there are a LOT of people that contributed with your project and helped you developing &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; with comments, recommendations, back and forward tests, ideas and would be a bit of unfair to sell them the EA that was developed in part by themselves. Yes, you are the owner of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;, but there are a lot of people behind this project, starting from TraderSeven (the creator of Firebird who I think should be mentioned in "&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;" code) to every member of Forex-TSD and ForexFactory forums that became part of it. I entirely read the thread about Firebird in Forex-TSD forum. There, &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; was born, and I see not only your effort, but the effort of all the people that was part of its development. I really thought you were different by giving &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; to everyone. You were staying out of the crowd and I was happy with that. You said you like to think "out of the box". Well, start selling &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; wouldn't be a good way to think out of the box, you will indeed be doing what everyone does. By reading your post, I see that your conception of being rewarded is receiving money, and that's not true. You have already received the best recompense someone could receive, which is: "Thank you, Hendrick". There are two ways a person can get rewarded for his/her valuable work. One is tangible and the other intangible. Here you found the gratitude, help and admiration of many people, that's the intangible way. The other is money, the tangible one. You are now choosing the last way, and that's understandable in the times we live. In this word most of people think that way. I if had to choose, I would definitely stay with the intangible recompense. If I were the owner of such an EA, I would be happy to give it for free, help others and stay with the profits it generates in my account (and the $40,000 of the Championship, of course). Smjones's signature says: "Not matter what we are talking about, we are talking about money". Finally he is right. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Too sad you don't "think out of the box" anymore… Don't get me wrong with my words Hendrick, I respect your decision. I'm a 18 year old Argentinian boy and this is just the way I think. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;Best wishes!

Hendrick, You can't be thanked enough for your efforts with bringing the EA this far. We should all hope that you will help us 'programming challenged' in the future with vers. P5 as I'm sure it will continue to mature. There are great minds on this BB falling the EA who will like to see this continue. Regarding your confession, I almost take it as a challenge to figure out your 'secret' in why the contest EA is doing so well. With the few 'hints' you've provided in the above quote as well as other postings, I'm willing to bet that it may have something to do with; 1. Partial performance is based on matching the Pair to the EA rather than trying to get the EA to work on the Pair. Thus having chosen USD/CAD for example may not have yielded the same results as USD/JPY. Since you stated that even if we examine the contest code, we will not find it. Then it must be some other variable. 2. Optimization of the variables are definitely key to the superior performance. Since mode 4 will be very different, then perhaps you will be utilizing something like 'walk forward' optimization? That way it will almost always be optimized based on a historic data range. There are dangers to this method. 3. Part of the secret may be utilization of GA or NN technology. Given MT4's limitations, possibly GA enhancements. My only other thought is that you are using another development program to aide in your development of P5 or P2007. I guess this makes for a good mystery. Regardless, as mentioned before, you can't be thanked enough for your efforts! R, Alan

Sorry guys, the backtesting results are ONLY to March 10 06.....Don't know where the data has gone...I'll repost it IF I can find it.

Ok. I think my latest post needs some clarification. I’ve received several e-mails from people asking me to make them an indicator or an expert advisor. And of course for free or maybe a small fee, but not too much! You know this guy Hendrick? He believes in sharing, so come on let’s ask him to make free things for us! If I’m some kind of machine: push the button and you get your free EA! So at a certain moment I really got the feeling that some people are taking advantage of me. It made me a little desperate and that’s why I wrote this latest message. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; This version of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and all the following versions will stay available for free to the public. Maybe I will make one or two EA’s to sell and maybe not. All I want at this moment is to continue the work on &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; with the support of all these nice people in this forum. So let’s get back to work again!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi Bellefemme, See my latest post (Clarification). We'll continue the work on Phoenix and Phoenix and all the following versions will stay free of charge and we all are going to work together to make this Phoenix the best EA ever!

--- 帖子 #689 ---
[quote=alamanjani]Hendrix, I second upper statement. You deserve pay for your hard work and efforts. Since I'm not able to make money on my own in Forex, I would also be interested in buying your EA (if you ever decide to start selling it) if not to expensive.[/QUOTE Thanks for your support Alamanjani. See my latest post (Clarification).

Hi Pabloski, See my post (Clarification). Hope you understand how I felt when I wrote this post about not making the next version of Phoenix avialable for free. Phoenix and all the following versions will stay for free. Thanks for your support.

Here is 6 month back test of USD/JYP on Mode 2

--- 帖子 #696 ---
I doubt it will be of any consolation, but I think it's worth mentioning that "Ovenstone" is no longer available on any public forums. I removed it and have now continued it's development on a private forum for almost the same reasons you quote. The final straw was when some young idiot told me that I needed to hurry up because the last version was not making money quickly enough and proceeded to tell me how lazy I was because updates where taking to long and I was not answering his emails quickly enough? Can you believe some people? I wish you the best of luck of luck Hendrick, if you leave a succesful EA on a public forum, you are going to need it. Cheers Wayne

i agree with handrick,we are so close to the success so don't care if Phoenix will sold or not,what we get is not only the EA but also communication and friendship ,we come all over the world ,we are world team , i will work for handrick and the Phoenix ,because it's a good EA,that's enough! to be a good tester is also a challenge job.so let's do it

--- 帖子 #699 ---
I have been watching this thread since a month now, and I am very impressed with Hendrick's EA. I am also impresses with the Championship results. Although I am not active on FF, and being a long time "Manual" trader, this EA thing has attracted me. I have downloaded Phoenix V4.2 and v5.0. Just a small test on metrader, phoenix 4.2 worked well and gave results, however when i tried to test phoenx 5 on metrader strategy tester, I got EMPTY results (no trades, no graphs!) Can anybody suggest why?

Hi Wayne! I have to admit that there's a continuous “battle” in myself between 2 things. On the one hand there's my firm belief that sharing knowledge without restrictions is one of the ways to improve the world. On the other hand I have to deal with this bunch of people trying to take advantage of me and my work (telling me to hurry up because they want to sell Phoenix on eBay, sending me e-mails asking me to make them a system for free, sending abusing e-mails if you don’t want to meet their demands, or people asking me over and over again the same questions…). I can fully understand that some of the makers of “free” expert advisors finally quit and continue their work at a private forum.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; But I've promised now to keep &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; alive and available to the public and I think it’s just to keep my promise.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; But now we have &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt; at FatCat too &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Wayne&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hello Mr Phoenix, and the others. Thanks to everybody for the work. I use for real Phoenix 4, and i have backtested it a lot. But i am not so enthusiastic. One big problem for me is that you have differents results depend on when you start the EA. Why don't you let the EA open and buy more than 1 order ? It will validate or not the signals you have and stabilize the EA. i have changed the start fonction to enable the EA to open a buy or sell order each time a signal occurs, and i wait 15min between 2 orders. void start() { if(Bars&lt;100 || IsTradeAllowed()==false) return; if((CurTime()-LastTradeTime)&lt;900) return(0); // 15min if(CalculateCurrentOrders(Symbol())&lt;=1000) CheckForOpen(); CheckForClose(); } the CalculateCurrentOrders fonction return (buys+sells); LastTradeTime=CurTime(); // each time an ordersend() is called. I will backtest it this week, but i wait for your comments. &lt;!-- / message --&gt;

I can imagine very well you’re having doubt at times. Especially when you have to deal with those nobheads and not to forget people like me of course! ;-) (not sure there is much difference! hihi!) Must be well frustrating when people are only interested in there own wellbeing and don’t care how they get to this result. They just expect to get everything presented on a golden platter. As I told you b4 I’m a strong believer in Karma so I’m sure it will ‘sort itself out’ in the end... I suppose the downside of an open forum is that you can’t really filter out ‘the bad ones’. On the other hand, the advantage of an open forum is of course that you can share a lot more idea’s than you could do when you are just with a limited amount of people (as long as EVERYBODY shares...). And I’ve got the feeling (correct me if I’m wrong; since I don’t see the PM’s and e-mails you receive…) the majority in this forum are, were possible, trying to help and make Phoenix even better then she already is. I do like your philosophy where you say everybody has there own quality which should be shared. Like you described it; if I’m able to fix your computer, maybe next time you can fix my lawnmower! I think we need more people in the world how think like this! On that note… not sure my contribution on this forum is that valuable, but hey, I can make a hell of a coffee!!! So if anyone is ever in the neighborhood…! ;-) Take care Harry and good luck!

Hi Sstef, I'm really curious about your tests, but changing the code this way will turn &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; into a completely different EA then it is now. I think there are hundreds of possible changes that you can make to &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, but it's important to me to preserve the main concept as much as possible. Appreciate your contribution and please let me know how this change works out for you.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Better day: Monday Worst day: Friday The most consistance version was the classic one. And by the way your most consistance version of Phoenix is your WINNING PHOENIX CONTEST version with your old setting. About your ambivalence of the future on Phoenix (free or anything else) let's my say that 2 years ago I had a forum on finance and I let it go because I was exhausted about many people asking for EVERYTHING without giving nothing but their bad humor for nothing. Some people thing they are gift to Earth. One day it will be enough. Good lock with Phoenix. Sorry for my english. Robert

I have two ideas. First one is about a little help to Hendrix here on the forum. Every time, when we see keep repeating (not very usefull) questions about time frame etc... addressed to Hendrix, let we jump in - whoever is first - and answer and that way take off Hendirx a little of burden. And Hendrix, you just ingore those questions, let we take care for them. Second is about sharing. Now mostly Hendrix is share with us. Mine idea is, that we start too. My suggestion is, that we all send email's to Hendrix, whith a little description, where we are (live) and what we do. So, that way, Hendrix get a little group of people, who wanna share back with him. Say, Hendix need something, he can ask the group, if someone know/can help.... If he is going for a trip around the world, he may be in the neighborhood of someone and that one may help him with something.... That way, there would be two way sharing... much more fair.

Hi Alamanjani! This is very good Alamanjani! Today and yesterday I spent EIGHT freaking hours answering e-mails (not only in this thread but also in my Private Mail and my Yahoo-account). And I suddenly realised that if I continue this way there’s no time left for the further development of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;!! So I have to change something but I still don’t know what. Just ignoring these mails is no option because that wouldn’t be polite (and there are also a lot of nice, friendly and interesting people out there sending me e-mails. And I will of course keep in contact with them because I love to know all these people from over the world). But I would appreciate it Alamanjani if you want to answer these repeating questions in this forum. Thanks for your support! &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; (If there's someone in this forum from &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;India&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; then please send me an e-mail! Within 6 weeks I will make a trip to &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;India&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; for 2 weeks with my wife and my eldest son. Will be in &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; for 2 days so if I can meet someone there that would be marvellous!) &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Hi Tom! Well, it seems that you are one of those that have better results with Mode 3 than others. I think we will keep this Mode &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="3 in"&gt;3 in&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; for now.

Hendrick, I just have a question about the signals Phoenix generates. During this week I ' ve seen that depending when I oppen the EA, the buy/sell position opened varies. For example, this week I opened the EA in one computer and a few minutes later it opened a sell position in USD/JPY. Then I decided to start Phoenix in my second computer and a few moments later it opened a buy position in USD/JPY. So I had a buy and sell position for USD/JPY in two different computers at the same time! In the comments on the Championship website, someone called "Freaky" wrote this: Hi Hendrick, I use your EA since 2 weeks. It gives me 8 TP in a row! GREAT. I've made an indicator showing the signals made by Phoenix. Here it goes: If you see the picture and if those signals are right, it seems that Phoenix can give two or more opposite signals with little time diference. And this is similar to what happened to me during last week. Could you clear this to me? Thanks a lot!

Here some forward test for last couple of weeks with two different brokers These mostly phoenix 4.2 as I am not fan of small improvements.

Previous file was too long Here is the one with both brokers ...sorry, just some new accomodation problems with these attachements

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Hi there, I feell like I am tuned to this threads after reading it for a few hours and looking for a little feedback Thank you for clarifying that post about you 'going private' and I understand now that inspiration you have created will stay where it is now. I found the place with your buddy buddies (FF) and it is inspirational I'll tell you About ideas for new developments in Phoenix I just have this wild gess that you already maybe doing this in Phoenix as you mentioned about 'your little secret'. Sure averybody have to have some and I do not want to break it. I just had these in may head and do not know how to (MQL) . So... It is about natural laws again. As you have signal1.. signal2..signal 3.... I am gessing that combination of these sinals let you follow natural laws of repeatable patterns and it is just have to be timed in sync with real pair price movement in 'wave like' fashion It is great and will lead to great success as long as we in sync. I am maybe totally off on this but this is the reason to have all timeframes signals to see whole picture as m15 maybe missing the view of some big turn. Still looking for your feedback on higher time frame Signal(s) within m15 As I understand Phoenix development will continue ...thank you very much My post #620 about this on f-tsd did not really touched anybody Just tell me if it is so 'out of line' that I will not become annoying and go some place else One thing to say 'No' and another to ignore it Maybe it is not possible in MQL technically?? thanks again hendrick I am at your feet and you can write to corner_house at fastmailDOTfm

When backtesting P.CONTEST I can't get the result the contest is showing (28 476.80 Equity). I wonder why...backtesing always shows way worse results. Anybody else experiencing this?

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Here are my results for the week running P5 on 15 minute charts 24 hours per day. The only test that showed an equity gain was a test that combined modes 2 and 3. I can't explain why individually they lost but combined they won. Might be broker differences. I think it will take more forward test time to see what is really happening. I do question the way mode 3 works. The mode 1 results below include P4 trades that are still closing.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Same thing here. However, some of the entries appear to line up. Many do not. Also, on the championship site someone posted an indicator version with up/down arrows supposedly indicating entry points. Again, some of the backtested results align with these triggers, many do not. I guess the EA doesn't exit and reverse direction when it receives a reversal trigger? (That would explain many of the discrepancies at least with the indicator version.)

--- 帖子 #724 ---
It was default with MaximumRisk=0.07 I will prepare 1, 2, 3 modes separately on 3 terminals. Do you have any suggestions ?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Just wanted to chime in and say hello and to thank Hendrick and gang for the great contributions here. I jumped to the end of the thread and realize I'm only halfway through reading everything, although I already have feedback. But, better to read up on everything before making suggestions, etc. Congrats Hendrick to your success in the championship. May you continue to be at or near the top! Regards, Bill

--- 帖子 #726 ---
The first post of this thread hasn't been updated since Oct 9th and refers to v4.2 as the latest version. To get the "real" latest version, one must read through the entire thread (which I'm doing). Hendrick, if you can, please update the first page to best orient newcomers. Thanks! Bill

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Comparing these results Classic looks better to me for the following reasons. 1. Even though Classic (Mode 1) yields a lower return when trading the same number of lots as Mode 2, it's max drawdown is 1/2 that of Mode 2. So, if you double your lots on Mode 1, the overal return doubles and is actually better with Classic ($36.2k vs $35.5k). 2. The Win % of Classic (80/83%) is better than Mode 2 (67/73%). 3. The Profit Factor of Classic (2.36) is better than Mode 2 (1.75). All these things point to Classic being the better performer.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Actually, one question I had is whether or not an apples-to-apples test was performed comparing v4.23 and the latest v5.x build? In particular, Classic v4 vs Classic v5!

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Reading through the thread, there was a suggestion on providing an option (or new mode if you will) for scaling down as the person raising the point observed that often times price will initially move against the opening position with Phoenix before it finds its groove. I think somehow that got misunderstood into scaling up, or adding to the position as price moves in the desired direction. Or, maybe there was no connection between the two ideas... Anyway, I'd like to renew the suggestion for at least one scaled out entry at a user-defined threshold (e.g. 20-30 pips). I would keep the SL and TP the same as the initial Classic position, just add an additional entry at a more attractive price. With the superiod win/loss % and profit factor ratios of Phoenix Classic, this could really tally up the pips. What do you think Hendrick and gang? Bill

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Anyone forward-testing v4.23 and the latest 5.x build side-by-side? I'm curious on how Classic v4 and Classic v5 compare with one another. I'll likely go ahead and set up some forward tests on this and see how if fares after a few hundred trades. Yep, need a good bit of history to derive any meaningful conclusions, but, then if indeed the settings for this strategy are temporal or seasonal in nature, it may be that once we've tallied up a few hundred trades its time to change the settings... The reassuring thing is that Hendrick's 6 month backtests appear to correlate current forward tests. This is a great sign. But, how and at what point the settings get adjusted when/if things start going against the grain (e.g. consecutive losses) seems to be one of the issues I'm sure Hendrick is keeping a close eye on.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Hi Billword Correct me if I'm wrong but as far as i know, Classic v4 and V5 are exactly the same except that V5 has less pairs optimized.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Me too..i wonder why?

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Hi Pabloski, I still haven't used this indicator, but looking at this picture my first impression is that &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is generating too much signals. A solution to this could be to build in some sort of mechanism that will flatten out the number of signals. But on the other hand &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; needs to make decisions in a very short time when it has to deal with spikes. One time I noticed that &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; reacted as fast as lightning to a spike and made a profitable trade in only 20 seconds. So I'm not sure at this moment what will be the best solution for this. I will study this indicator closely in the coming week. Thanks!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Well, I think you're absolutely right about the synchronization of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; with "time". I think that the Contest version is now completely in sync and this explains also why others don't get the same results. For me it's still a mystery how to get &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; in sync. It has maybe to do with the time you put the Phoenix EA to your chart. I've noticed that the best time to do so is Sunday before the market opens or start &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; an hour after a big news event. So picking the right time to start &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; seems to be very important. I will follow your suggestion about the higher time-frames. Maybe you can do some tests yourself next week. Start &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; at different times and then study your trades at the end of the week to see if you can find something. Thanks for your contribution. I think this issue of the right start time will become more and more important in the coming weeks.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Hendrick, I've been studying during last week this problem of when Phoenix should be put on a chart with the help of two terminals and 16 charts. There can be difference if you put EA now and 15 minutes later, for example. However, this difference dissapears in 2 or three trades. After 1 trades, now Phoenix 5 on my computer opens positions exactly as Phoenix 4 Contest in the championship. This can be explained in the following way. The signals for entering positions appears very often, however if Phoenix has already opened a position, it ignores all signals until this position is closed. So, you have one position. When you put another Phoenix it opens position, that is different to the first one. However, later, the first position or second one is closed, and if there are not any new signals for entering and the last position is also closed, new positions will be opened at the same time by the same signals.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Ok. So the best thing to do is let it run and it will get in sync eventually?&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Absolutely. It also can be proved by backtesing, starting from different dates.

For example, EUR/JPY, backtest from 01 may 2006 &lt;TABLE cellSpacing=1 cellPadding=3 width=820 border=0&gt;&lt;TBODY&gt;&lt;TR align=right&gt;&lt;TD&gt;1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.01 11:00&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;buy&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;142.96&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;142.12&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.38&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD colSpan=2&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right bgColor=#e0e0e0&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.02 09:30&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;t/p&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;143.38&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;142.12&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.38&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;36.90&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;536.90&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right&gt;&lt;TD&gt;3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.03 09:45&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;buy&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;143.05&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;142.21&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.47&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD colSpan=2&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right bgColor=#e0e0e0&gt;&lt;TD&gt;4&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.03 12:17&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;t/p&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;143.47&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;142.21&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.47&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;36.32&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;573.22&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right&gt;&lt;TD&gt;5&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.03 19:00&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;sell&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;143.48&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;144.32&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.06&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD colSpan=2&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right bgColor=#e0e0e0&gt;&lt;TD&gt;6&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.04 20:10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;s/l&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;144.32&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;144.32&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.06&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;-73.33&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;499.89&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right&gt;&lt;TD&gt;7&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.05 05:00&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;sell&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;4&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;144.34&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;145.18&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.92&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD colSpan=2&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right bgColor=#e0e0e0&gt;&lt;TD&gt;8&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.05 15:17&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;t/p&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;4&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;143.92&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;145.18&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.92&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;36.31&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;536.20&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right&gt;&lt;TD&gt;9&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.08 09:00&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;sell&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;5&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;142.29&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.13&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;141.87&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD colSpan=2&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right bgColor=#e0e0e0&gt;&lt;TD&gt;10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.08 10:04&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;t/p&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;5&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;141.87&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;143.13&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;141.87&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;36.31&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;572.51&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right&gt;&lt;TD&gt;11&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.08 16:00&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;buy&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;6&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;141.75&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;140.91&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;142.17&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD colSpan=2&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right bgColor=#e0e0e0&gt;&lt;TD&gt;12&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.08 23:00&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;t/p&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;6&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;142.17&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;140.91&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;142.17&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;36.32&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;608.83&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right&gt;&lt;TD&gt;13&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.08 23:30&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;sell&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;7&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;141.92&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;142.76&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;141.50&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD colSpan=2&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;TR align=right bgColor=#e0e0e0&gt;&lt;TD&gt;14&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD class=msdate&gt;2006.05.09 02:28&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;t/p&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;7&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.10&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;141.50&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;142.76&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD align=right&gt;141.50&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;35.60&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;644.43&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Okay, I've researched this some more and have a better handle on this. Besides code clean-up in v5.x (good job Hendrick!), I understand there to be two new options applicable even in Classic mode, e.g. ClosedAfterHours and BreakEvenAfterPips. See the excerpt below from the docs. However, these two options are off by default. So, yes, it appears that v5.x Classic and v4.x should operate the same. So, then the real question is what are the best settings to use for these two new options which potentially enhance Classic's performance? Anyone do any testing yet with these options? Bill ------------------ Mode1: This is the Phoenix Classic mode. In this mode it’s working the same as the previous version (version 4.2). But now you have 2 extra options: CloseAfterHours With this parameter trades are closed after a certain number of hours. So CloseAfterHours=36 means that the trade will be closed (in profit or in loss) exactly 36 hours after the OrderOpenTime. BreakEvenAfterPips By using this option the StopLoss will be set to breakeven as soon as your trade is a certain number of pips in profit. ----------------

Hendrick: Great job cleaning up and re-organizing the code in v5.x. I like your style! One very minor thing. In the divergence section that has been streamlined by removing maF1 and maS1, the code is still declaring maF1 and maS1 in the following line PHP Code double maF1 , maF2 , maS1 , maS2 ; Thanks for the great enhancements you're making. Bill

This point was raised before in this thread, but, I don't recall seeing an answer. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, thread searching isn't working right now so I can't pinpoint the prior post. But, the question has to do with the Percent values which drive the deviation amount for the envelopes. The point raised before was that nothing below 0.1 could be edited within the Envelope indicator settings (e.g. it reverts to 0.0 for its value) and the evelope that gets created at percentages below 0.1 appear to be so tight as to be meaningless. For example, the default settings for UDFJPY are as follows: PHP Code Percent = 0.0032 ; EnvelopePeriod = 2 ; Bring up the Envelope indicator and insert those settings to see what I'm talking about. The band is so tight that price regularly closes above and below it just about every bar. However, a value of 0.3 yields a "more meaningful" envelope. The docs for the iEnvelope function also show the deviation number apparently imited to the 10th decimal place (at least that's what they have by way of example). I'm wondering if there's just a simple error here which may be causing the 1st signal in actuality to be overlooked by virtue of a decimal precision issue. Or, maybe there's something else we're not aware of going on here. Hendrick, could you kindly shed some light on this? Thanks Bill

In your P5 install are you using the default P5 settings for USDJPY or are you using the settings used for the contest version (which are different than the default P4.203 settings? I assume you're using the contest settings, but just wanted to make sure as I'm trying to reconcile the difference between settings right now.

I'm comparing the default settings on USDJPY in v4.203 with v5.603 with the version of the EA posted on the MQL4.com contest page. Here are the default settings for v5.603: PHP Code Percent = 0.0032 ; EnvelopePeriod = 2 ; TakeProfit = 42 ; StopLoss = 84 ; TrailingStop = 0 ; SMAPeriod = 2 ; SMA2Bars = 18 ; OSMAFast = 5 ; OSMASlow = 22 ; OSMASignal = 2 ; Fast_Period = 25 ; Slow_Period = 15 ; DVBuySell = 0.0029 ; DVStayOut = 0.024 ; Here are the default settings for v4.203: PHP Code SMAPeriod = 2 ; SMA2Bars = 18 ; Percent = 0.0032 ; TakeProfit = 42 ; StopLoss = 84 ; TrailingStop = 0 ; OSMAFast = 5 ; OSMASlow = 22 ; OSMASignal = 2 ; EnvelopePeriod = 2 ; Fast_Period = 25 ; Slow_Period = 15 ; DVBuySell = 0.0029 ; DVStayOut = 0.024 ; Here are the default settings for the contest EA: PHP Code if( Symbol () == "USDJPY" ) { SMAPeriod = 7 ; SMA2Bars = 14 ; Percent = 0.0032 ; TakeProfit = 42 ; StopLoss = 84 ; TrailingStop = 0 ; OSMAFast = 5 ; OSMASlow = 30 ; OSMASignal = 2 ; EnvelopePeriod = 2 ; Fast_Period = 25 ; Slow_Period = 15 ; DVBuySell = 0.003 ; DVStayOut = 0.024 ; Summary: v4.203 and v5.603 share the same settings. The contest version has differences in the following: PHP Code SMAPeriod = 7 ; SMA2Bars = 14 OSMASlow = 30 ; DVBuySell = 0.003 ; Do the differences with the contest version represent enhancements made during additional recent backtests?

wow...cool...thanks for your prompt reply...now at least i am sure that those who did not get similiar results had it because phoenix only takes one trade at a time....hmmm, anyone with good suggestion as to how will one know when to really start phoenix???

In looking through the code and default/optimal settings, one thing has had me confused. Namely, the reason why some pairs default settings have fast_period &gt; slow_period. For example, the following pairs optimal/default settings have fast_period greater than slow_period: USDJPY EURJPY CHFJPY AUDUSD What's interesting about this is that currently JPY pairs appear to be leading in performance on various forward tests posted by members here and of course USDJPY is doing great in the contest. I thought someone had also posted results showing one of the AUD pairs also standing out, but, I can't readily find that post. Maybe there's something to this? A "slower" fast setting and "faster" slow setting is the answer to the "true" hidden patterns/rhythm? Bill

Hi Bill! Thanks for all your contributions. It's much appreciated! I did some backward tests with Percent 0.1 , 0.01 and 0.0001 0.1 - 16 trades - NetProfit 2.638 - MD 7.57% 0.01 - 114 trades - NetProfit 9.303 - MD 13.9% 0.0001 - 122 trades - NetProfit 19.883 - MD 7.16% I agree with you that an envelope with a deviation &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="0f"&gt;0f&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; 0.0001% makes no sense at all. Still, testing these low values shows a remarkable difference with higher values. I have no explanation for this. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Some pairs have much better results with a FastPeriod &gt; SlowPeriod. So why not use them?

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Correct. Will fix that.

Is there someone in this thread that is willing to collect all the proposals that were made to change the code of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;? I've made a list so far of these proposals but I can't find the stupid file anymore. I really haven't the time to search the whole thread again! So if there’s someone out there who want to do this..please!!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Don't use Mode 3 until further notice. Mode 3 is not working as it should. My fellow Dutchman HerbertH (Thanks Herbert!! You're Gold man!) has spent his whole weekend to fix Mode 3. The fixed version will be posted tomorrow. Did some tests and Mode 3 is now working nice and easy (great job Herbert!)

While I'm new to this thread, I'd be willing to help out with maintaining a consolidated feature request list. I used to own a software company and that was a big part of what I did. However, having just spent several hours over the last couple of days studying this thread, I loathe the thought of going through the entire thing again. If acceptable, I'd be willing to step up to maintain the request list on all future requests. And, here's my current list ------------------------------------------------------------- Billworld Phoenix Wish List [C=Code; F=Forum; S=Strategy, D=Docs; T=Testing; G=General] ------------------------------------------------------------- Nov 12: [D] enhance docs to explain the strategy (take excerpts from interview on MQL4.com) Nov 12: [s] create version which scales down as price initially moves against entry, make threshold amount user-defined as well as the number of scales positions (max up to 3); maintain same TP/SL as initial entry Nov 12: [s] create version which takes every signal and reverses directions on reversing signal (doing so may require taking smaller TPs and tighter SLs) Nov 12: [D] explain differences between contest settings and optimal/default settings in current versions Nov 12: [C] create visual indicators to assist with analyzing trades and confirming entries/exits on charts Nov 12: [T] test the curve-fitting concept to see how well it would have played out in prior history, determine sample period (e.g. 6 month period from mid to end of 2005) and then apply optimal settings from this sample period to backtests performed over the first 6 months of 2006; determine at what point (if any) the sample period settings begin to fail; if patterns exist with respect to the time it takes for new settings to be determined, use this as a guage for timing future optimizations Nov 12: [T] assign volunteers to do specific tests over specific time periods using specific settings Nov 12: [F] update first page of thread to represent best "landing" spot with most up-to-date info on the latest developments (e.g. latest builds) of the project --------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Bill! I'm very grateful for this! It gives me more time to concentrate on the further development of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. This means a lot to me! Thanks again!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

One more I forgot (and a biggie in my book): Nov 12: [T] perform backtest over time period of contest and correlate results; substantiate the idea that backtesting results are accurate and meaningful

Hi Wackena! This kind of summaries helps me a lot. Thanks!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Thaks for your reply. I am already doing some digging and will post it later

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Wackena, In your attachement to this post, how did you get the results to partition out by pairs?

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I think it’s important to draw some conclusions at the and of the coming week in order to give the development of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; a firm push in the right direction:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Pairs&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Which pairs are suitable for &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; and which not. So far we have USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY, USDCHF and GBPUSD. I’m still looking for the best settings for these pairs and the settings for the other pairs.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Modes&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; We now have Mode1 (Phoenix Classic), Mode2 (Phoenix Second Trade) and Mode3 (&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 123). My fellow Dutchman HerbertH has spent his weekend looking at Mode3 because it was not working as it should (HerbertH is Gold!!). So there will be a new version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; with the fixed Mode3 tomorrow. Mode 1 is doing ok. There were even people who tested a combination of 1 and 2 with very good results. So at the end of the week we have to decide which modes have to be continued and if there should be a fourth mode (I’m working at it right now)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Brokers&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Running demo-accounts from some brokers are worthless because their data feed for demos are very different from their data feed for live-accounts. So if we can make a list of preferred brokers at the end of the week this will be very helpful.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Changes&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I had this file with all the proposals to change the code of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, but I’ve lost the stupid thing. I’ve asked some people to reread the threads again and collect all the proposals. Maybe at the end of the week we have a complete list of to-do’s.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Last but not least, let’s work al together to make &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; a better EA. I will watch the Contest version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; very closely because if I’m not mistaken, starting this week the USDJPY will start to drop substantially. I’m curious how &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will handle this.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Howdy,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Just got two ideas (was called out of my standby this morning @ 3:15 –SIGH- so must have done something to the old brain ;-) ) Will only post idea 1 2day since it’s long enough trying to explain this one as it is… To start of, I don’t know if the following already has been done/tried/invented by someone else… if so, sorry didn’t want to ‘steal’ it. Just haven’t seen it yet (still a rookie..).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Here goes…&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I think it is safe to say that after all the optimizing that has been done in the past the TP and SL of Phoenix are pretty much set and reliable (give or take a few pips). My idea is based on when best to EXIT a trade. At the moment &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; is either using the SL or the TP. Unfortunately sometimes the exit is a bit early and we could have made a few more pips if in some cases the tp was higher..&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; What if we therefore would incorporate a sort of ‘leading tp'. No idea if something like that already exists but don't know how to call it otherwise (sort of the opposite of a trailing stop..) Let me try to explain. For this example lets assume we are LONG. There NEEDS to be the following condition: current price/profit comes within 5 pips AND ONLY THEN (SO NOT BEFORE) of the originally set TP, which is usually 42 pips. If it then keeps pushing this TP up to prevent it from reaching it. If we now, at the same time attach a trailing stop (=upwards moving SL that NEVER moves down again to protect profit) of f.i. 5 pips BELOW the current price; it would in theory keep on following a continuing trend upwards until the juice really runs out.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; We will then only get an exit of the trade at the (hopefully!) higher SL. Come to think of it… this would make an actual TP obsolete all together because it will never reach this point (being pushed upwards).. An added bonus of this could be that it will prevent brokers to ‘play there tricks on us’ as soon as they see we are about to reach our TP...&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Just an example in numbers which hopefully makes it a bit clearer what I’m trying to eplain..&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 1) You go long @ 1.0000&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 2) @ 1.0037 (42 pip profit minus x (in this case x=5)) change the current SL into a trailing stop (so protect profit and hopefully increase profit) of f.i. 5 below the current price (again open to discussion) so therefore it starts it's ‘existence’ @ 1.0032 (=1.0037 minus 5).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; If now the trend continues (see attached picture for an example were I think it could have worked nicely) it will keep following the market until it comes back down and exit at the newly formed trailing stop..&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The obvious downside of this is of course that if unfortunately after reaching 1.0037 the market turn against us we will only have a profit of 32 instead of the otherwise 42 pips...&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; As I said before the value of 5 pips is only used for this example and aren't based on any backtests. Will have a look in the charts the next few days to see if my above theory makes sense at all whatsoever (told you, I’m ‘a bit’ tired..). &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; And PLEASE give me your feedback!!! Positive and/or negative! Trust me I can take it! Cheers, Vince&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Vince: You took the words right out of my mouth.... It'll be an interesting week for P5 with all of the red flags on the calendar, we'll see. In the meantime, I battling a massive headcold and have about 10 different drugs in me right now...even this is getting me lightheaded...

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Meaning? You already tried this? In that case, as posted in the beginning of my post didn't want to 'steal' anyone else’s idea! Kudos to you then! Just haven’t come across it yet! Funny to see more then one person can have the same idea's across the world! I think the have a term for this phenomenon. Think they call it "collective memory". Vince &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hoi Vince, If I understand correctly, this would be a delayed TrailingStop? So the TrailingStop would only be activated as soon as price gets near the TP? Do you (or maybe onyone else) have any experience in trading this way? The idea sounds good! Groet uit een nat NL (Greetings from a rainy Netherlands)

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hi Herbert! Good to see one more fellow countryman! Well, the weather down here isn't much better I'm afraid :-(&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I think your way of summarizing makes it much easier to understand! I tend to be able to explain something relatively simple, the hard way ;-) Added to the above, I would, once near this TP, and after activating this delayed trailing stop, remove the actual TP to make sure it isn’t being hit early. Maybe I interpreted Palmers post incorrectly but I think he was hinting with his "Vince: You took the words right out of my mouth...." that he already has tried/invented this in the past. Were you Palmer? In that case could you share your findings please? Would be much appreciated! Would be a shame to invent the wheel for a second time! Time for bed!

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I was getting at the notion of locking in profit at a certain point...that's all. Please note that I am currently wacked on Tylenol, Alka-Seltzer, Mucinex, and Zicam....my thought process is worthless right now....I didn't mean to say that I was stealing somebody's idea....peace.

Hi everybody Ive heard alot of people had success combining mode 2 and 3 together. How does one go about combining modes like that? Ive read the whole thread and I dont remember seeing how it was done. If it has, I apologize. I know alot people posts questions that already have been answered. Thanks

I have been demo-ing pheonix for 3 weeks starting with 10k. I have been up as far as 11.5 k and am now back down to 9.5k.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
This is my first ever forward testing (and first demo trading) so it is no suprisse I have big mess. I used several different EA, running minimum two at a thime, sometimes, three. So data and numbers arent to acurate. I was messing too much around. I have statement, but it is probably not usefull. I have there few manual trading, and PhoenixBooster with 8 losses in a row and few other EA's. Anyway, I collected together numbers for two main EA's I was using last two weeks. P v4_2_03 generated $1.102 P v5_6_01 generated $1.233 (more than half trades in mode3) On the same demo account starting with $5.000 Phoenix is IMPRESIVE!!!! Mario P.s. just in case I will add statement, but it is more or less useless.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
To be honest I’m a little overwhelmed by all these proposals to change/improve &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. A lot of you have very good ideas but what I’m really afraid of is that changing to much of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will finally leave us with a completely useless Expert Advisor. Believe me; I’ve seen this happen more than once with other EA’s. I truly believe that at a certain point you have to stop making changes. Too much of these and the “spirit” of &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; will be restrained too much to do its work.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I agree that &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is not suitable for all kind of markets. But if the market is right then &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will do its work. Look at the results of the Contest and you know what I mean. The Contest version made 23 trades so far with only 3 loosing trades. Look at the Balance. Do you really want to change that? &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; You always have the option to switch &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; off when its performance gets worse and put it back on when things are changing for the better.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Best solution will be to let 2 opposite EA’s work together. When one of them fails the other one, more suitable for the market at that moment, will kick in and continue the work. It’s not too hard to make an EA that will complement &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. I like this idea so much that I will make a separate project for this. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; To make a long story short; at the moment I think it’s not right to make extensive changes to the code of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. On the other hand some of your proposals are making sense and I would really like to test these changes to see if they can improve the performance of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. But I can’t do this on my own. For now I’ve only limited time to work on &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, so if there’s a programmer out there that can judge those proposals to see if they are useful or not then this would be very helpful. I just can’t do this on my own! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

I try Phoenix_4_Contest.mq4 in interbank (demo) and Phoenix_EA_v5_6_03.mq4 in Alpari (demo). Result that Phoenix_4_Contest.mq4 is more profitable.. I don't know why, in my demo account Phoenix_EA_v5_6_03.mq4 is not really profitable.. For me, Phoenix_4_Contest.mq4 is beautiful !! Thank you Hendrick! And Congratulation, you are in the top ten again ! http://championship.mql4.com/2006/pa...ants/Hendrick/ Viva Phoenix ! Viva Hendrick !

Following the Contest Ratio / Results, and all tests/works (night and days) made by HENDRICK, i think it's a judicious decision. Keep It Rocking Hendrick.

Hi all. Do I understand correctly that setting ver 5_06_03 to mode 1 will give me the classic version? If true is that with the contest settings as well? I read the manual but have been confused a bit by some posts here so I wanted to clarify. I got pretty beat up last week using mode 3 and lost almost all my positive equity. Wouldn't you know it was the first week I tried Phoenix on a live account too. BTW: I agree with what some have said about getting Phoenix in sync. It seems once you get it the right way it doesn't miss and once it is going the wrong way you have to wait for the trades to cycle out. Thanks

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I need clarification also. On backtesting, if I put the mode to 1, and adjust the settings such as stop loss and take profit I am OK. But when I type in 2 for the mode, and clear the take profit and stop loss in mode 1 and transfer to mode 2, backtesting does not work. Ditto for mode 3. Does mode 2 work off of Mode 1, or is it totally independent? Thanks. Also- Does anyone know of a good, reasonably priced programmer for EA's?

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Melissa- I have found that also about the cycles. I am getting ready to go live with a small amount. I am going to look at the trading championship and wait until Hendrick (Harry) is not "in" a trade. I will then start the EA. This way I will be on the same cycle. I am also going to use the traditional EA from this post. http://championship.mql4.com/ Matt Hey Palmer: How is your cold? Man I have tried to learn MQL programming and it is testing my patience. Same thing with learning C. Don't know if I am cut-out for that. I guess I need to drop it for a couple of days.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Maybe because the contest version uses different settings for USDJPY? (That's my understanding anyway, see my earlier post on this.)

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I began 4 demo accounts yesterday running Phoenix 4.x/5.x at 2 brokers as follows. All installations began running within 30 minutes of one another. I don't recall exactly the order in which they were started up, so the A-B-C-D sequence doesn't necessarily represent the first started to the last started. A) IBFX P5.63 (default Classic settings; mode1, max risk .30, micros, decrease factor 1) B) IBFX P4 Contest version (default settings) C) FBFX P5.63 (default Classic settings; mode1, max risk .30, micros, decrease factor 1) D) FBFX P4 Contest version (default settings) Interestingly, this morning I check and see the following. A) Placed a long entry at 117.23 at approx. 01:30 GMT which exited when TP was hit at 117.65. B) Placed no trades. Remains flat. C) Placed a short entry at 117.33 at approx. 07:00 GMT which is open right now at a -60p floating loss. D) Placed a short entry at 117.33 at approx. 07:00 GMT which is open right now at a -60p floating loss. Conclusions ------------------------------------- - Oddly we were long at one broker and short at another at the same time (although entries were offset by about 6.5 hours). - Install B didn't make any trades even though the contest version at MQL4.com did make a trade during this time (long entry at 117.15) - C) and D) installs placed entries at the exact same point even though I thought the settings were different for the Contest version vs the relased versions (or is there a settings file which the contest version is reading which overrides the default settings in the EA, Hendrick please clarify) Now, to test the theory that installing and starting a fresh EA at the same time as when the MQL4.com contest version remains flat, I've now installed an additional new installation of the Contest 4 EA as currently the MQL4.com contest version is flat. We'll see if it gets synced up with the MQL4.com version at the get-go.

Here you have the results of 4 backward test for the USDJPY Mode 1 . Period 2006.5.1 2006.11.10 MM=false (see reports for the rest of the settings) Test A Mode 1 Without other settings Test B Mode 1 BreakEvenAfterPips=32 Test C Mode 1 CloseAfterHours=120 Test D Mode 1 Combination of test B and test C So it makes sense to use the setting BreakEvenAfterPips to improve your results. Net Profit will increase but what's more important MD will decrease.

Here you have the results of 2 backward test for the USDJPY Mode 2 . Period 2006.5.1 2006.11.10 MM=false (see reports for the rest of the settings) Test A Mode 1 Without other settings Test B Mode 1 Mode2_Opentrade_2=22 Using the setting of Test B will decrease the MD but also the number of trades and the NetProfit. The setting Mode2_CloseFirstTrade is useless (thers's no test results for this setting). I even think the code for this setting is not working as planned. Will look at that.

The latest version of Phoenix with the fixed Mode 3 (The HerbertH fix!) will be posted tomorrow.

I found this .doc on ForexTSD forum. It discusses method to get 99% Model Quality. It's a good read, but seems to be labor intensive. Could be worth the effort. Wackena

Hello all, this is my first post on ForexFactory. Came across this great forum through various links, including references to Hendrick's great EA from the championship. Congrats Hendrick on your championship progress, and for sharing your vision with all of us. The fact that you are so open in sharing and encouraging collabrative work on your EA shows a deeper understanding of the markets -- one that I too will aspire to some day. Thank you. I am not much into "hanging out" on forums but I do a lot of work behind the scenes. One thing I would like to share with you, to help advance the Phoenix project, is some data processing work I'm currently working on. Some other folks and myself are working on a project to bring free tick data to the masses through various means, including collecting it on our own. The benefit of using tickdata to backtest with is that you'll get a 99% modeling quality, which is excellent and true-to-life, assuming your tickdata is clean. We don't have a formal infrastructure in place yet to distribute the data, but it is available and moving forward nonetheless. I am processing 2006 USDJPY data today so I can test it with Phoenix. How do you recommend that I post it here? Can I upload the ZIP file, which is probably 10-15 megs? Or will they allow me to post a link? The data I'm working with currently is from Gain's free tickbank, but cleansed to organize and remove irregularities. We also have a procedure to convert this tickdata into a format that can be used easily for MT backtesting. Thanks. ::dusktrader

Jinx! You owe me a beer. PS: definitely worth the effort, if you want to put any faith into your backtest results.

Hi, Mr.Hendrick and everybody! I’m new here, and first of all, I want to introduce myself. I’m from Moscow, Russia, name is Artem. I’m on Fxmarket from 1999 and believe that the only way to have a success here – is an autotrading, because only a machine can follow Your own rules of trading without fear, up to 7-th figure after point and 24h/day. I created many of EA’s, had profits and losses by kilosUSD, I saw many another's EA’s and I think Phoenix is THE BEST I’VE EVER SEEN! Big respect to Mr.Hendrick and wish You All the Best in Your Life and Contest! I’ve read the hole thread and if Mr.Hendrick wrote “On the other hand some of your proposals are making sense…” I want to prepose some ideas: 1/ Now for several days I have P4 on my acc and have many trades at a time on different pairs. So, I think, if we’ll try to close all trades, if TotalProfif satisfys us. For example: total=OrdersTotal(); if(total&gt;1) { for(cnt=total-1;cnt&gt;=0;cnt--) { if(OrderSelect(cnt, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_TRADES)==true) { if(OrderType()&lt;=OP_SELL&amp;&amp;OrderProfit()&lt;0)//any Simbol {loss++;}}} if(AccountProfit()&gt;300 //$300 or$500etc &amp;&amp; loss&gt;0){cl=1;} if(cl==1) { …“Close all!!!”…} … if(total==0) {cl=0;loss=0;} 2/ What do You think about to put TP according to the nearest level of Pivot (from 1h tf)? (ind. – is in att.) 3/ As I see on my acc the pairs with EUR are very dangerous, because, as someone said here, it has "too much information?" 4/ I put on EURJPY the settings from CHFJPY. It’s good for now… You can even compare two charts. They’re very similar. 5/ I absolutely agree with Pabloski: TP on 2-nd trade (MODE2) must be the same with the first. Or it’ll be more risky. As I saw the real acc is a little bit different from demo +/- 1-2 pips. And if we’re speaking about micro patterns these difference can be fatal! So, next week I’ll put about 5kUSD to work with Phoenix. Let’s see… I’ll place my results here.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
This is excellent. With such a low MaxDrawdown, you can double up on your lots and thus double your ROI beating hands-down the other options in terms of Net Profit while keeping MD at or below the others. With this, I see Classic (Mode 1) with BreakEvenAfterPips=32 by far the best performer. Also important is Profit Factor, can you also please include that calculation in future reports? Regardless, here once again Classic beats the other options as it yields less trades with higher profit (when doubling up lots). Therefore, the Profit Factor will be commensurately higher. Good work Hendrick! Another Classic moment... Bill (feeling Classic)

--- 帖子 #789 ---
One more follow up question on this. Hendrick, can you post the detailed trade record? Do the Test A trades from Oct 1st onward align with the results seen in the MQL4.com championship? (I'm hoping that is the case as I'm yearning to see backtest results for Phoenix with corroborate live forward tests, thus erradicating any concern that backtests are not accurate.) Thanks! Bill

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Hi Artemos: Just to be clear, you're proposing two features. 1. Close out all positions when the total account equity increases by xxx$ (e.g. user-defined). 2. Determine TP based on x distance from a pivot point based on an hourly timeframe. (indicator attached) Could you kindly provide more detail on what you have in mind with item #2? Thanks Bill

--- 帖子 #791 ---
To fellow Phoenix mini/micro lot traders. What currencies are you finding that works best and settings that are working out well? Thanks..

--- 帖子 #792 ---
The question is with what do You want to sinchronise Your EA? The easiest way seems to me is through the number of Bars: int Cntbars,Go; int start(){ Cntbars=Bars+1; if(Cntbars==Bars) {Go=1;}//once &amp; forever if(Go==1){ …..GO! That means that You EA’ll start exectly with the begining of the next bar after loading.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
1/ Exectly! If some ammount is enough 4 us, we're closin' all trades &amp; open opportunity to enother signals to work. 2/ Look att. Smth of that kind...

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hi Artemos: As I'm trying to help out here by collecting proposals, could you kindly elaborate on exactly what issue this suggestion is looking to resolve? Is it the issue of people attempting to synchronize their testing results with those posted for Phoenix in the MQL4.com contest? Or, are you tackling some other coding issue? Thanks! Bill

--- 帖子 #795 ---
How I love this Contest version of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;! To me it looks like a spider in its web, waiting and waiting and waiting until it's absolutely sure it can catch its prey! If you ever watched a spider at work you know what I mean! Sometimes it makes a trade that makes my heart missed a beat, but every time (almost) it was the right trade to make at that moment. If I was a manual trader (which I'm not) I surely wouldn't make the same trades as &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;! And that’s why automated trading systems are important for people like me. These systems don't have to cope with fear and greed, which are as we know the most common obstacles to become a successful trader.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; It's still 6 weeks until this contest will come to an end. And to be honest I've no idea where &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will finally end. Sad thing is that when the contest ends (2006.12.23) I’m on the airport for my flight to &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;India&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt;. Hope I don't miss my flight because I'm stuck in some kind of cybercafé on the airport!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; (Still no one I can meet in &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;New Delhi&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;??)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Ok guys...now it's the time to start a new demo with Mode1. I know why the Contest Version is waiting!! Hurry up!!

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Hendrick wrote: "Well, I think you're absolutely right about the synchronization of Phoenix with "time". I think that the Contest version is now completely in sync and this explains also why others don't get the same results. For me it's still a mystery how to get Phoenix in sync. It has maybe to do with the time you put the Phoenix EA to your chart."

--- 帖子 #798 ---
As I saw the real acc is a little bit different from demo +/- 1 pip. And if we’re speaking about micro patterns these difference can be fatal! So, next week I’ll put about 5kUSD on real acc to work with Phoenix. Could You recomend me what ver. of Phoenix to use, that'll be more interesting?

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Hendrick, In a recent post you said " I know why the Contest Version is waiting!!". Do you mean you know why the Contest Version is winning? dbcmkx

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Hi No, I think Hendrick means the way Pheonix waits to make a trade, the correct trade. Like his story about the spider, wating for the right moment. Cheers, JC

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Hi! I have a proposal about a modification of Phoenix. According to backtests, the maximum number of consecutive losses is 2, for example, for USD/JPY. So, we use Martingale. When we have 2 consecutive losses of 0.1 lot each, that is 84*2=168 pips, third position should be opened let's say 0.3 lot, therefore total loss of three trades will be only 132-168= -36pips instead of 42-168 =-124 pips if we open third position of 0.1 lot. Please, give your comments! P.S. to Artemos - Zemliaku privet!))

--- 帖子 #802 ---
I've logged this proposal. Just to be clear, what you're suggesting is to triple the number of lots after 2 consecutive losses with the assumption that the next trade will be a winner (because backtesting shows only a max of 2 consecutive losses, although I thought the max was just 1 loss) as a way of reducing the effect of the two consecutive losses. Regardless, if indeed Phoenix can continue limiting consecutive losses, a method of scaling up the lots would make sense. Currently, Phoenix has an option which does the exact opposite, namely, it reduces the number of lots after a loss. I would think it would be rather easy to reverse this. Suggestion noted and added to the list I'm keeping. Thanks Bill

Update by installation. Some in sync with MQL4.com contest installation, some not, some oddities. A) Entered long at 118.14 (similar to long entry just made on MQL4.com) B) Still hasn't placed any trades. Is IBFX not allowing Phoenix_4_CONTEST from running on demo or real accounts? (That would be odd) C) Entered short at 118.14, TP at 117.72 then reversed and entered long at 117.72. I have no idea why it went short when all other installs went long, but, it worked here. D) Entered long at 118.13 similar to MQL4.com contest version.

Hats of to Hendrick with the competition and ALL the work he has done. I tried various setting on USD/JPY for the past 6 months [on 90%] and can't get any thing better than the defaults and what he has been trying in his last post.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
someone made an indicator showing the signals made by Phoenix. the code in http://championship.mql4.com/2006/users/Hendrick/page2 and i make an indicator by it so we can have a look at how the Phoenix works Here it goes:

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Important to note is that said indicator shows all signals. Once in a trade, Phoenix does not exit upon receiving a reversing signal.

My demo's are running great while my live account is a complete loser. I have had 6 trades is a row get stopped out. I switched from mode 3 to mode 2 and the first 3 trades have opened and are 40 pips down. Any suggestions as to why this is happening? Thanks

I restarted testing today on three pairs usd jpy, eur jpy, and gbp jpy. I am using Phoenix 4.2.02. An order was placed on the usd jpy at exactly the same price as Hendrick in the contest with same stop loss and target. The broker is North Finance. Here are the settings I am using for usd jpy: SMAPeriod = 2; SMA2Bars = 18; Percent = 0.0032; TakeProfit = 42; StopLoss = 84; TrailingStop = 0; OSMAFast = 5; OSMASlow = 22; OSMASignal = 2; EnvelopePeriod = 2; Fast_Period = 25; Slow_Period = 15; DVBuySell = 0.0029; DVStayOut = 0.024; I am assuming these are the contest settings.

Hi preacher165, care to post how much is the "slaughtering"? ,aybe some grpahs + data will do great. Even though i am sure phoenix is much safer and less wild than firebird.=) Look forward to your post! thanks. cheers, ed

--- 帖子 #814 ---
There is a Firebird thread. I would suggest if you want to look at the many versions of FB and and results go over to that thread and leave this thread for Phoenix. If we start posting statements and discussing FB it will detract from the Phoenix discussion. If you look at the original FB and Phoenix threads you will see the original overlap in participants.

Wau, i didn't understand everything in that tutor, but I still like it I have one 'lazy' question. Say, someone sucesfully complete all steps and get 99% acurate data. Is it possible, to copy that file onto another computer and that way get 99% acurate data onto that computer? That way, you don't need to understand process and you still have chance to get 99% backtesting tool lol Mario

At this link website, http://championship.mql4.com/2006/participants/Hendrick I saw Hendrick's account history usd/jpy and these below trades were loss.

Idea: OP_SELL with TP=Ask-TakeProfit*Point+spread Especialy for pairs with wide spread. For example, for CHFJPY Alpari has sp=5. And today on my acc was not enough 2p to rich TP and now it's in minus. And all res/supp lines are based on Bid charts. What d'U think?

As always: looking nice :-) Just one question: what was your starting balance please? 5000? Trying to beat your optimization of course ;-) Thanks!

at this time now, phoenix is -ve in post BUY

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Yes, you can definitely do this. You produce an FXT history file for the pair and timeframe you are interested in. This file must initially be moved from \experts\files (where it is created) into \tester\history (where the backtester looks to find it).

I now have 8 losers in a row in my live account. I can't get over how bad Phoenix is doing. I switched from mode 3 to mode 2 and it opened up 2 more trades and they both stopped out. I am not getting down on Phoenix, but I sure would like to understand what is happening. I can see how well Hendrick is doing in the contest so I know something is out of sync on my side. My demo accounts are now being beat up as well. Just an observation on my part and this may not apply to anyone else but it seems that Phoenix can not perform well when the market is moving well. It seems to work much better in a choppy market. I would appreciate any suggestions anyone may have. (except "welcome to fx") Thanks

Before I started this thread I had no idea that it would take so much time: answering all the questions, proposals and so on. Only yesterday I suddenly realized that it was no longer fun to work with &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. All this work has a negative influence on my family, my regular work and my health. So I decided to be no longer part of this forum. It’s simply too much for one person. I will go back to my PC and try to find again the pleasure I had before in making Expert Advisors. Just me, my PC and MT4, which will be more than enough for the moment. I have no idea what my plans will be for the future. One thing is certain; I will continue the work on my EA’s. Transforming my crazy ideas about how to conquer Forex into Expert Advisors.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; You’re all free to do with &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; whatever you like. But please be gentle to my baby. It’s an EA with a “soul” so don’t try to change the code too much, because if you do so, the “soul” will leave Phoenix and, believe me, Phoenix will end as so many EA’s before: on the scrapheap. She doesn’t deserve that!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I will always be available for advice if you want. The best solution for now I think is to point out someone in the forum that’s capable to coordinate the further development of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I wish you all the best !! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #830 ---
I'm seeing the same thing. Since mid last week, my Live Mini and both demos having several more loses than winners. I've noticed in all backtest results on Phoenix there are periods of few days to 1-2 weeks of more loses than wins. It could be just what you said, the difference between a rangeing to moderate trending market. I just hope this doesn't last too long. Now is when patients is a necessity to fx trading. Patients and hopefully only short term deep pockets. Wackena

I have used Phoenix (Mode 3) in my min IBFX live, too. It went up about 400 pips in three days, and then about two days, all disappeared. So I stoped it on Sunday. My demo with Mode is continuing, it went up about 300 pips, and now loss about 100pips. The timing to use Phoenix is very critical, too many singals generated. I will use it again until I understand the timing, and until I could filter out some bad signals.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Mode 3 is not reliable. use Mode 1 or at least The Contest Phoenix Version. Regards.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Same thing happened with my installs. It took the SL on the buy and then immediately rebought.

Sorry to hear that Hendrick. Thank you for sharing and compensate bulk of time with us. I really really appreciate what you've done so far. We'll continue look into the Phoenix and wish you all the best in the contest. Good luck and god bless you. Regards, David

Saying “thanks” doesn’t come close expressing my gratitude for all the effort and generosity you have shown in the past but I’ll say it anyway: thanks! I think it’s wise indeed to call it quits as soon as you notice your health and family start to suffer but nevertheless I’m also convinced that everyone here will agree that you will be greatly missed! I sincerely wish you can find the enjoyment in making EA’s again like you did before! One ‘final thought’ (that is not mine, I must admit, but I think is rather appropriate): &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; “ Slow down and everything you are chasing will come around and catch you”. Hendrick, take care, all the best and don’t be a stranger! Vince

Hi all. I hope my post about the 8 losses did not offend Hendrick or anyone else. I certainly join everyone in thanking him for his dedication to this thread. Whats more, I hope he knows that we all take a bit of pride in the fact that he is leading the contest. I also want to say that I participate in other forums and this is one of the very few that has been lucky enough to have participation from the EA or method creator. I hope that after he takes a break, Hendrick will come back where he is admired and wanted. Thanks for everything!

Anyone know how the divergence function works? I can see programmatically what it is doing, but how does this indicate a divergence? I don't understand why it needs 4 different MAs. If this question has already been answered, just point me in the right direction. Thanks.

OK, Hendrick, you are right and fully deserve it. No more new ideas let's just enjoy Phoenix run in championship and see you getting the big prize (I hope) Then you can have vacation break and think about future EA's (maybe) thanx again and we will be just fine in sync with your champion one... cheers

Thanks for all your contributions to the forum Hendrick. As for the person that posted "I can't get over how bad Phoenix is doing" I would bet that had something with driving Hendrick away. He has answered hundreds of posts (many of which were posted by people too lazy to read the threads) and given hundreds of hours to this forum over the last few months. You stated "you can't get over how bad it is doing", how long have you been testing Phoenix? How many good trades go with the 8 that you mention? Have you forward tested the EA for any length of time? I can't get over how awesome Phoenix is. I can't get over how awesome of a guy Hendrik was to share it all with us and I REALLY can't get over how great Phoenix is performing in the championship!... that's what I can't get over...

i do not believe any professional trader would mean anything personal toward hendrick. I certainly didn't. I just take a very pragmatic approach toward trading. And to succeed, we all have to be that way. I commend hendrick for doing what none of us could do. i will still be giving pheonix a chance along with some other things.

Since you addressed me, I will answer. First, I was not the only one who posted their Phoenix accounts were getting beat up. Second, I said that I was not down on Phoenix but wanted to understand what was going on. Third, What I posted was the truth and that should be enough. Finally, I made that post because I was surprised after demo testing Phoenix with great results and was honestly looking for some answers, and one more thing, I never, ever sent pm's to hendrick requesting anything, I never suggested any changes to Phoenix. It is easy to find someone to blame when you think you have lost something, but if one can't post the truth, then why are there forums in the first place. I have read every post in this thread. Have you? I noticed that you did not bother to quote from my post #841.

Anyone know why when always backtesting rezult it's amazing and in trading live the rezults it's so losses. How can I interpret the rezult of the backtest for future live trading? what is the point who must analize for considering the rezult of backtesting is trusted?

Hi, Just to give you guys a heads up, I have been working on a "How to optimize &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;" for the past few days so in the future everyone can run their own tests. Just waiting for 'the master' to have a look at it and to share his views/green light to post it. Out of respect for his work and since I value his opinion very much, I will not do this before he had an opportunity to do so. Knowing how busy he is and in the light to all that happened, I suspect this could take a while, so please all be patient! Cheers, Vince

Why thank you ... and I wish you all the best in the Championship. Half way there and you are in the top 3 consistently. Let's hope that there will be a monetary reword for your hard work that you have put in. PS. If you want me to further explain some of my ideas in private then PM me. Take care, Salty.

For GBPUSD DVStayOut=0,0022 (Last var.=0.05) I'm going to optim. all settings from 01/04/06 on 1m. I'll give You my results.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Here are some results from one of my Phoenix demo accounts. You will see how well it started and it still remains in profit. The account is in my friends name but it is my demo. I have three Phoenix demo accounts but because this one started so quickly and is the only one still in profit, I thought it might reflect better what is happening now. I have shut down Phoenix on my live account but I am hoping we figure things out so I can go live with it in the future. I make this post only to reflect what is really happening(to me) and in return, perhaps help make Phoenix a better EA. I do believe in Phoenix or I would have never put it on a live account. http://ss.gamers4jesus.com/Phoenix1Demo.htm

I've asked these a couple of times before, but, does anyone know why the defaults for USDJPY in the contest version are different than the released versions (both for 4.x and 5.x)? For example, here's a partial list of differences (there are additional differences): defaults for contest version SMAPeriod = 7; SMA2Bars = 14; defaults for released version SMAPeriod = 2; SMA2Bars = 18;

--- 帖子 #866 ---
I've asked this before, but, just wanted to ensure the question was clear. Has anyone been able to get backtests of this EA to confirm forward tests? Since extensive backtesting is used to derive optimal settings, it would sure be nice to see clear correlations between backtests and actual forward tests. For example, it would be nice to see backtests of the period from 10/1/09 to present using the contest version of the EA which match the results posted on the championship site. I've tried, but, haven't been able to get them to match up. I know that the precise starting point can have a lot to do with it, but, if you set Strategy Tester to begin the same day as the contest began, presumbably even if the actual start time is off by some hours, one would think that after a certain period the backtests would sync up with the live results. That hasn't been the case with the basic tests I've done. Just wanted to see if anyone else here has done more in depth tests and has been successful with this, or at least has information as to why its not working. Thanks in advance for any input on this. Bill

Please find attached the first version of my attempt to explain how to optimize &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;’s settings. Please realize that, as always in Forex, back testing doesn’t guaranty anything for the future! First of all thanks to Hendrick of course! Without him there wouldn’t have been anything to optimize at all… Hopefully you will be able to run the tests yourself now and there won’t be any need anymore for the usual: “Can anybody post the most resent/ best settings for currency pair …” My thought behind this is that I’ve always been a strong believer in trying to educate oneself. I’m not convinced that just spoon feeding everyone by posting 100 and one found “best settings” will help anyone. Why would you want to sift through an x amount of settings produced by others, when you can find them relatively easy yourself? I can imagine it can be daunting at first when you are new to it all. But I’m still relatively new to EA’s too. I have learned so much in the past few months just by reading, experimenting, playing with settings and asking questions when I couldn’t find my question already being answered somewhere. Another reason for wanting to do optimizing yourself is that one person prefers to optimize for maximum profit while someone else might prefers lowest % of drawdown. Finally, I found that different MT4’s downloaded from different brokers gave different results… (even when using the exact same data…). So what works for someone else might not work for you.. You have all the available tools to make it work best for YOUR preference. All you need to do is put some effort in! But hey, it’s just my humble opinion. Everyone is different so it is up to you! Good luck testing and please let me know what you think of the manual. Your feedback is much appreciated! Vince

Bill, I just did a Backtest of usdjpy with Phoenix-v4.2.03 and compared to same period of demo (forward test) of same EA. Attached are results in an Excel file. One sheet is Demo and next sheet is Backtest. Big difference. Lots sizes are slightly different, but not enough to invalidate results. Demo produce much better. Also, Model Quality on Backtest was 90%. Wackena

--- 帖子 #869 ---
I had an telephone conversation with IBFX to investigate why Phoenix Contest results in the Championship were not the same as my IBFX account over the same time period. They were not sure why, but thought server response time or data feed difference might be factors. They did advise that they plan to have a live tick data feed for Demo testing availabe in a couple of months. Unless your Broker is using Live tick data for Demos, your results will be somewhat different than your Live trading account. Wackena

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Each update had further optimization of the preferred settings. Hendrick explained this in the last thread as well as the beginning of this thread. This Hendrick quote sums up the theory while v4.2 was in use. Because of the success of the contest version I think the optimization time frame has been open for re-evaluation.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Good work, that explains a few things. Thanks

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Excellent. Thanks Wackena. This corroborates what I've been seeing. Not to cause undue concern here, but, if backtesting is used as the primary means to derive settings for a system which openly admits to being curve-fitted based on recent backtesting, and said backtesting does not corroborate with live or forward tested performance, then, settings derived from this method would not appear to accurately represent the reality of the situation. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with the premise here as long as forward/live tests match backtests over the same period. If one can't get to that point, it would appear one is shooting in the dark... This is just an observation which in no way denigrates or in any way whatsoever shows lack of appreciation or respect for all of the wonderful contributions made toward this project.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Thanks for doing this wackena (cool name btw!). I've been rather closely monitoring the championship servers' quotes vs what I have on my IBFX, FBFX and FXDD accounts (amount other brokers) and haven't noticed that big of a difference. Certainly not a big enough difference to through off the envelopes and SMAs used for triggers in Phoenix. Also, what this doesn't explain is why some entries are near perfectly aligned and others are way off. Since Phoenix is hard to visualize on charts (without any real indicator which matches the way it operates) and its "secret" is reliant upon settings derived from extensively optimized (e.g. curve-fitted) backtesting, if we can't correlate backtests to something which occurs in the real world like forward/live results, then, I say we're surely on shakey ground. I venture Hendrick is concerned with this as well (although I haven't had the pleasure of any direct contact with him to date) and that's one of the reasons why he's decided to go back into research and development mode without distractions from the group here (nothing wrong with that mind you).

Great job, cool EA, my respect, Hendrick. Trying some backtests of different phoenix versions, results differs from doubling (and more) deposit to margin call. Looking at indicator for this EA (dot't remember by who, posted at championship forum), I've got an idea - open trade only by some consecutive signals. added some code to EA( like this for sell signal) : if (CurTime()-s_time&gt;900) {ss=ss+1; bs=0;} if (ss&gt;=signal_count) { res=OrderSend(...SELL....); ss=0; s_time=CurTime();} I think, it will help to filter out single signals at gaps, etc.. Made this for ph_4 (contest ver) and for ph_5 at mode1 (last ver) - the result is a new significant parameter for optimizing using pref_settings=true; For EURJPY, for example, I've got 50% increase in profit turning signal_count to 5 (not less than five consecutive signals opens trade). Surprisingly, this didn't reduces total amount of trades, only placing orders more precise. Attaching both changed files, hope it's usefull contribution to phoenix development

--- 帖子 #876 ---
In addition to my previous post : with that signal counter, mean opening trade only by some consecutive phoenix signals - just for fun I've turned this counter to great number (50, 100, 200 etc.) - It was a stunning surprise - the Phoenix can catch the trend then ! For GBPUSD with open order after 200 cons.signals - only 28 trades from May.2006 till now - but only one loss, somewhere in the beginning. Look at the chart, what's happening to Equity with high MaximumRisk !

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Cool idea Dagnar. Seeing all of the signals generated by the indicator someone whipped up, I was thinking about this as well. Thanks for doing this. Now it's time for testing the concept both forward/backward. So, will this EA exit an open position and SAR after receiving x signals in the opposite direction? Or, are you just focusing on entries? Cheers Bill

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Sounds great, thank you! Does both version shows similar increase in profit? Did you happen to add that code, which shows buy/sell sign? http://championship.mql4.com/2006/users/Hendrick/page2 I'm not sure if copy/paste is enough or I need to do something else. Would you mind add those signals into EA so we can (who want) visually track them. Btw, is it possible, to add switch, so you can turn on/off showing these buy/sell signals? Mario

Have just one question, more of IT related nature. What programme is that in your zip doc with .mq(?) extension. Can not open it at all. Mine is Explorer 7, is it coz of that?

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Privet, Artemos. Can you please post your backtest with the new parameters for USD/JPY you offered. I've tested them, but the results are about 50% worse than with initial settings

--- 帖子 #883 ---
I am not sure what zip document you are asking about. *.mq4 files in this forum are for MetaTrader which is a free charting and trading program. In this thread the file will probably be an expert advisor. You can use notepad to see the code in a *.mq4 file if you do not have MetaTrader.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
hi Dagnar, I just had a look at your idea...backtested it and - WOHOOO! - AMAZING! Maybe I am doing something wrong but it's really good. I'll have a closer look @ it this weekend, I think. Looks great. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Dagnar, I've posted your msg and your changed version here, at sisters thread: http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...html#post64083 in case if you are not aware of it. I hope I didn't violate some rules.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Mind this: !!!!! if(lot&gt;10) lot=10; !!!!! Because, in real trading there can be problems to open a trade with a lot more, than 1'000'000= (1/100)! It can be detained and open at over price or cancelled at all!

Appeal. Dear Hendrick be kind say the opinion concerning the offered introductions to the expert. And how we all must correct Phoenix 5 Mode 3?

--- 帖子 #889 ---
to your question about posting the statement: No, I'm not gonna post the statement, back test it yourself. I am not saying that to offend you or sth. just but because your OWN results are way more valuable to you. And to this "Appeal": I'm not sure what you're talking about but Hendrick left the forum so he probably won't answer you. And btw, read the whole thread, please. That is one reason why Hendrick left this thread, I think, so many people asking questions which they wouldn't ask if they had read the whole thread. That is: unnecessary questions.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Couldn’t agree more...&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #891 ---
great, Vince. @ wackena and all the others: If there is really such a big difference between demo and live we should try to compensate that. Is it because the price / quotes are different and therefore less high-quality signals are generated? If so, we could let one demo run and pipe its signals as 'Buy at market' for the live account. So if a demoSignal is generated then open an order live. But if the discrepancy is because of the requotes, slippage and spread widening, then it sucks. Then we can just choose the best broker and trade there. Do you think there's a big difference between the contest's results which are demo and your live ones? If so, why is that? Is FXDD (which might provide the feed) better for Phoenix? In my backtesting FXDD shows better results than Alpari's data which I normally use for BT. With FXDD I get 90% m.q., too. What do you think about these issues?

--- 帖子 #892 ---
tradeigel, As I feel most do, I use the present Strategy Tester and available data to help me develop EAs. Backtest bar data is basic OHLC data. LIve data would contain the interlace movements within each bar. Until LIve tick data is recorded, purchased or made available from Brokers, my confidence in Backtesting is moderate at best. As posted earlier, IBFX Broker plans to offer Live tick data in near fulture. As important as I feel about using Live tick data to backtest, it is not my only concern. I also see difference from my Demo to Live results on several EAs, including Phoenix and Firebird. I've seen and have been told that after Demo charts are checked to confirm good entry points, that in Live trading more bad entry points are seen. I feel one reason is that Demo order execution is instant and Live trading can have delays many times between order request and order execution. One delay can be whether your Broker is providing tick data feeds direct or through a Trading Desk, and how they filter the data. Another reason is on low volume pairs, Live trades are not executed until minimum volume is accumulated. I don't know what is the minimum volume, but I have manually executed orders and they did not go though and FXDD advise this was the reason. The slippage variable has no effect in Demo testing, but does on Live trading. Live trading can have either, if slippage too high, order execution to be many pips away from order request. Or miss the order completely, if slippage too low. You do not see these effects in Demo or backtest. To try to summarize, I think using Live tick data for backtesting is critical, and at present, we will not see identical results between Demo and Live trading. Everyone should ask their Broker if they have Live tick data feeds now for Strategy Tester. If not, do they plan to offer one soon. If someone finds a Broker providing Live tick data for MT4 Platform Strategy Tester, please post the Broker name. Well, enough rambling on my part. Everyone have a great weekend. Wackena

I have been trying to figure out some settings or mode that is working well right now. I am not a programmer so I don't understand why Phoenix enters a trade when it does. When I manual trade I use a longer timeframe to give me a more accurate picture of what is happening. For some reason Phoenix has not performed well in the past week or so and we know it can't always win. Big problem is, it lost all the previous gains. My question is, can we use a longer timeframe as a guideline. I am sure there is a solution. It just seems a shame to me not to figure it out. Also if anyone has been doing well over the last week or so, please share your results and settings. Thanks

Greetings from the Sister Thread on Forex-TSD for Phoenix. We have spawned off two threads to help manage the questions. They are titled: "Phoenix - FAQ, Stable, User support -Read Post #1" Phoenix - Development+Suggestions - MQ4 in Post#1 The first post of each thread will contain the most updated information - so the entire thread doesn't need to be read. I have suggested and we are moving to a development style that works for very large open source projects. There are three basic kinds of users: people who want working code, people who want code to test with, and developers who want to include their ideas or fix existing bugs. The first group will have a "stable" release (which we don't currently have a candidate for) that has no major bugs, works well and has gone through a great deal of testing. The second group will be playing with different releases, experimenting with settings and enabling/disabling the new features. The third group will be a compilation of most or all code submitted each week into a single file. If the group that includes the code doesn't include the code other people want, then there might be a code fork in development. I'm posting here to avoid having 30 different version of phoenix all with their own strengths and weaknesses combined with random naming conventions and no settings files. Phoenix has very fragile settings, we need to use good settings in order to avoid absolute death of the EA in ?? weeks. I am considering a website that only manages settings files and test results organized by the version of Phoenix, etc. I will attempt to merge the mode 3 fix that Hendrick endorsed and some of the other changes that Hendrick planned on for release later tonight. How does this community feel about setting up sister threads for user and development (or keep this thread and make another dev-only thread)? For active developers, we also have a private mailing list so we can converse about code changes in private. I am going to number the version released 5.6.4 as a weekly build, and try to make it a candidate for "stable". Once Mode 3 settings have been verified, it will move up the chain to the first "stable" release I hope.

@daraknor : AWESOME, just awesome, this idea. Exactly what I was thinking of. I personally use linux, so I know this concept of an os-project, it has LOTS of potential! Additionally, I would be up for the some of each part (1,2 and 3).

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Great job Dagnar, I believe this enhancement should be made into an updated version called Phoenix 6, since it works so well! I've tested it and it works like a charm. Does anyone else agrees with me? Now we just need to figure out the best overall settings for eur/usd or if someone already has them, can you please share them.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Same here. Even though I do A LOT of back testing and optimizing I'm using the freely available ticks from alpari which are not the same as those used by my live trader. Therefore I'm not convinced if I'm wasting my time at the moment or if it has some use.. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Had a little chat with my live broker this morning and hopefully they will provide this soon... How soon? No idea...&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; At the moment I'm comparing my live ticks and quotes with the demo ticks provided with my demo accounts (which I used for all my tests). So far so good BUT this doesn't guarantee at all the other issues razed by you (time it takes to execute a trade and so forth...). But I think, however annoying (GRRR!!!) it might be to get 1 or 2 pip difference between live and demo execution, it might not be the nail to the coffin of Phoenix (ever the optimist..), since it's trades last quite a long time and over a big range...&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Good weekend! Vince (Will be abroad the next week so I will not be pestering the forum for a while ;-) )

--- 帖子 #899 ---
I don't agree you should call it Phoenix 6. If you want to fork development and release your own copies as a separate code body, please choose a name variant instead of using the same name. How many Phoenix 6 can we make! I think it would be incredible if we could make a ton of partially working copies and call them all the same thing. This is probably too sarcastic, but this post did come 2 posts after my plea to avoid doing this *exact* thing.

Hi everybody. About my previous post "Consecutive signals" for Phoenix, I've found a "small" bug in my changes to a code if (CurTime()-s_time&gt;900) {ss=ss+1; bs=0;} if (ss&gt;=signal_count) { res=OrderSend(...SELL....); ss=0; s_time=CurTime();} it's counting "ticks" during signal is "ON", means not counting signals 1 per 15min bar, instead counting ticks during active signal. That's why such amounts of consecutive signals (100,200, etc.) are working. The code should be : ...if (CurTime()-s_time&gt;900) {ss=ss+1; bs=0; s_time=CurTime(); }... Then even 2 or 3 as signal_count reduces number of trades significantly. On the other hand, this buggy "tick counter" instead of "signal counter" works too, at least at tester. Now testing it live, let's see...

Is it just me or does it look like everybody is deserting this thread…

--- 帖子 #904 ---
One thing of note, negativity breeds negativity which breeds disinterest, especially when we're all here to learn from one another. I think comments I've seen posted here recently such as: "No, I'm not gonna post the statement, back test it yourself." tend to scare people away (e.g. wondering, heck is this really a friendly place?) Yep, newbie chatter can cause veterans on any topic to get irrate. And newbies caught in the midst of lots of inconclusive and/or meandering info/data will sputter off at times before doing all of their due diligence... It's all sort of like price meeting resistance and deciding to turn the other way! And Hendrick saying bye-bye was one huge point of resistance! (I guess his Fibonacci tolerance level was hit!) Cheers! Bill

Dagnar, thank you for the original idea. Allow me 1 suggestion: A stricter way of testing 1 signal per bar is by using the Time[0] element (=open time of current bar) to check if it's still the same bar. The code can then be simplified a bit by using: Inserted Code datetime CurBar; ..... if (CurBar!=Time[0]) { ss++; bs=0; CurBar=Time[0]; } if (ss&gt;=signal_count) { ...OrderSend.... ss=0; CurBar=Time[0]; } Regards

--- 帖子 #906 ---
HerbertH, thank you for fixing Mode 3! And Dagnar, thank you for your improvements. I suppose, you both are part of development team, righ? So I don't need to copy/paste this msg and code into 'development thread', correct? Mario

--- 帖子 #907 ---
I watch both forums. The main reason for the separation was so Developers weren't plagued with user questions, and could find a friendly place to go. Different users have different needs...

--- 帖子 #908 ---
I've tried and I'm getting 25% modeling quality. Did you get any better numbers? Mario

--- 帖子 #909 ---
I've already posted a similar variant here: if (Bars&gt;s_bars) {ss=ss++; bs=0;s_bars=Bars;} if (ss&gt;=signal_count) { res=OrderSend(...OP_SELL...); ss=0; s_bars=0;} and then deleted my post, because it dosn't work. Just think. We must to wait N signals on N bars of the same signal. That only meens, that we'ra missing N-1 signals. That's all.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Besides, guys, I do not trus in Mode3. Already 2 weeks I have P4 on 8 pairs (Alpari). And all the time I have 4-6 oepn trades on diff. pairs. That meens, if we'll double/trible our pos's we'll only increase our risks and we'll miss other trades on over pairs because of free margin. --- P.S. For now results on acc are bad. Now I'm workin' on optimization of settings. I've already posted my set's for USDJPY, now - GBPUSD SMAPeriod = 3; SMA2Bars = 14; Percent = 0.0023; TakeProfit = 42; StopLoss = 80; TrailingStop = 0; OSMAFast = 26; OSMASlow = 18; OSMASignal = 15; EnvelopePeriod = 6; Fast_Period = 28; Slow_Period = 36; DVBuySell = 0.0003; DVStayOut = 0.0017;

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Hendrick wrote here about a sinhronization of working of Phoenix. I think it's very important to begin at a time. So, I made a little adding to the code, to start working exectly with a begining of a new bar. Look: int Cntbars; int init() {Cntbars=Bars+1; return(0); } .............. //======================Start function======================= void start() { if(Cntbars&lt;=Bars) { .......

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Thanks Artemos (Is that you in the Avatar? ) In theory Yes, but we all do backtesting to optimize and test (to avoid to fiddle around for month in life sessions) If backtesting with a 6 month period shows increased profits on average or less risk, then the idea itself deserves further investigation. And although I think backtesting currently s*(beep)**s in MT build 200, I rather put my money on backtesting than on my gut feelings. BTW. using 'Bars' for checking most of the time will work. The No. of history bars however could vary, e.g if you manually scroll back while the EA is activated, more history may become available and thus increase 'bars'. That's why I'd rather use Time[0] as a unique identifier. It's a bit stricter. Regards

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Please give mode3 another try; in this weeks build 5.6.04 it was changed to work like Hendrick designed it in the first place. Initial backtests looked promissing.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
The version of signal_count parameter in the 5.6.04 download listed above is based on sequential tick counts, not bar counts (I didn't alter from original code). This means the time counter is not used at all. Back testing this parameter is very strange at the moment, because MT4 just changed how the ticks are calculated. The Bar version should (*should but not verified*) have the same results in both MT198 and MT200 on the same data. If there are differences, it probably isn't the fault of the Bar version. Testing Build 198 vs 200 using tick calculations should have varied results. In testing the Bar version with 900 seconds, we have seen the maximum drawdown shoot up drastically in backtest. We're trying again with smaller delays between bars, and with the tick based version. It is possible none of these methods will achieve an increased balance *but still be useful* because they might make data signals more reliable. That means a single result may be lower, but (possibly) over time the EA would be more reliable. I think it deserves attention and study. The only change in the default behavior in 5.6.04 is HerbertH's Mode 3 fix, endorsed by Hendrick very strongly.

Thanks! Your settings are great, specially profit\loss ratio is MUCH better that initial one. Have you tried to get similar good ratio for other pairs?

Has anyone been able to test Phoenix on Tick Data available from Gain ( http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/ ) for 99% quality modelling? If so I would be interested to know results and settings used, e.g., for GBPUSD. Does anyone know how to convert Tick Data to MT format? The instructions in the modelling description don't make any sense. Any help appreciated.

I would like to know if it would be possible to use some of the Phoenix code for another EA? I'm mainly interested in the multiple Indicator bit. My reason for this is that I want to try and write a EA that tests Indicators and I could select the ones that are most effective. Also being a total noob at MT4 its easier to use existing code than to start from srcatch. I will of course add all the code on the forum once it is in a working state hopefully arround early Feb (I'm going away for most of Dec). I dont see an introduction section so... Hi everyone, I joined a while ago and have been reading allot of good info. Youve got a great forum here and I hope to add my little bit and hopefully succsess stories.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
As far as I know, you can copy/paste any open source code you like for personal use. You won't have any distribution rights to that code unless specifically granted by the author of the code. Hendrick is the copyright owner in this case.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
There were several bugs with all of the "Mode 3" versions. We have eliminated several but a few remain. This one appears to be an "innocent" error, not affecting trading but increasing needless chatter with the broker. I will try to fix it this week while reviewing live data. Are you getting several errors in sequence the first time the error is logged? Mode 1 should have error-free order execution.

hello Pals, does phoenix capable to handle micro account (0.1) ? i am using NF broker, now testing the phoenix with demo account. the phoenix execute 3 open trades at the same time and with 1 lot..i tried to change with 0.1 lot,seems not working. how to change into 0.1 lot and i prefer execute 1 open trades only.. pls help ya, thanks. jonisu

--- 帖子 #952 ---
For only 1 trade, switch to Mode1. To make the lot size 0.1 lots, please set Lots=0.1 and MM=false. A new version 5.7.0 is available for all people wanting to use Mode3. forex-tsd.com/phoenix/

--- 帖子 #953 ---
daraknor, hi there, I have been running mode 3 in test mode, on version 5_6_02, for a 6 weeks now. Up until a few days ago, with no problems. Then I got a trade placed with the comment of Sidus on it, instead of the typical mode 3 first trade comment. It was a larger single trade. Not sure what that was all about. Then today when I put 5_6_07 on, it opened up 3 trades and then closed #1 &amp;3 with a 7pt loss, and let #2 run. Is this a normal thing? I have had pretty good success with version 5_6_02 up until now. Is there any laymans terms as to what is going on, and what the changes in the latest release have done? Is 5_6_07 stable for live in mode 3? Thanks, and sorry for the long post. probably should have sent it in a pm.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
I don't know what the comment Sidus means, and I haven't seen it in the code at all. The most current version 5.7.0 seems to be stable for mode 3 for hundreds of users. There are major changes in mode3 from 5.6.7 to 5.7.0. Most notably, it works as intended! With such a large difference I needed to adjust some settings, and there are several discussions about what is going. Upgrading from 5.6.7 to 5.7.0 can be done without closing trades. The upgrade is available at forex-tsd.com/phoenix/ in the development thread. Most of the communication and postings over Phoenix happen on that forum. I don't mind long posts, I'm somewhat addicted to them myself.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Daraknor, You have done lots of hard work on Phoenix. How do you feel about Phoenix chances in another strong move in the market? Thanks, Traderbill

--- 帖子 #956 ---
Phoenix has had both loosing and winning streaks with short term large movements in the market. Generally speaking, a counter trend system should be trend aware and avoid trying to swim up a waterfall. Phoenix is not yet trend aware, but now that 5.7.0 is "Phoenix - Stable" in all modes, then the next phase of development will begin. I plan to make it "trend aware" in version 6. Any and all recommendations on indicators to recognize trends are appreciated (painting the past after a few days is okay if the indicator knows when to quit real time).

--- 帖子 #957 ---
hi! i got a problem with phoenix 5.7. i use mode 3 and it executes only one order, not 3 as supposed. the tp also is too high.. 130pips. is that normal?

USDCHF has custom settings: Mode3_TakeProfit = 130; Mode3_StopLoss = 80; So yes, that is correct for the currency.

Maybe an indicator would recognize trending markets by looking the previous daily ranges. If the previous days are trending then stay out until market quiets down (small bodies). Just a thought I had...

--- 帖子 #721 ---
I still haven't picked a trending indicator for Phoenix6. Ideally the indicator would show a strong sustained trend, and ignore news spikes. Most ideally, it would also show when the trend is weakening. Our indicator could come in very late on the trend (halfway up), but we don't want it to be wrong. We could also require the trend has been consistent for a certain amount of time, e.g. an indicator returns a signal, and we make sure it consistently returns the signal before using it as a filter.

Newbie question: How do I convert the settings in metatrader language as provided by Hendricks into an actual .set file? Thanks Andy

--- 帖子 #732 ---
I'm not sure which settings by Hendrick you are talking about but - The *.set files are stored in a folder called 'presets' which is under the experts folder. The set file will look like what is shown in post #560. When you first attach an expert to the chart a box pops up with two tabs. Look at the inputs tab. This is what is in the *.set file. There is a button to 'save' or 'load' settings. This is how the EA loads settings from the *.set file or creates a *.set file. Since we could not upload *.set files to FF directly we often changed the extension to *.txt instead. You would have to change it back for MT4 to recognize it. *.set files can be edited or looked at using the Notepad program or other similar simple text editing programs. I would suggest loading the EA and saving the settings on the 'input' tab. You can then look at or print that *.set file out and use it as a reference to determine which *.txt files and which other posts in the thread have the same variables and would be applicable. In this thread some of the posts showing people's settings were snippets directly out of the MT4 code. These changes in settings would have to be made directly to the code using Metaeditor. If you go over to TSD there are newer versions of the Phoenix EA. If you use the original EA realize the success was due in part to curve fitting during optimization. You would probably need to do some work in that area.
