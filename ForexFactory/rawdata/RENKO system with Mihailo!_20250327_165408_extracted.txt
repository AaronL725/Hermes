Hi to everyone!

My name is Mihailo and I'm dealing with the FOREX more than 3 years!

During that time i tried to find a system that suits me best. I spend a lot of time trading with the Thv system and earn a good money with it. When I first heard about RENKO candles, I came to the fantastic conclusion that  time is not the most important factor for trading.

I think that there is no mater if price goes 20 pips in any direction in 3, 5 or 25 minutes.

Only thing that is important is that PA GOES 20 pips in whatever direction and I want to catch it!

RENKO system shows you THE MOVE on the market - who cares in what time!

In this thread I will try to explain, to everyone who wants to know, all what I know!

WELCOME!!!

*********** Renko Thv 5! ***********

*THIS SYSTEM REQUIRES BASIC KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN TRADING OF AT LEAST SIX MONTHS!*

***                            HOW TO INSTALL!                                  *** or you can download the installation manual here

1. Extract "Paket 5!"

2. Install Stratman font in your Windows+Fonts folder

3. Copy RenkoLiveChart_v3.3.ex4 from Experts folder to your experts folder of your Mt4

5. Copy profiles "5!!!" and "Renko thv 5" from Profiles to your Profiles folder of Mt4.

6. Copy all templates from Templates folder to templates folder of your Mt4.

7. Start your Mt4 platform!

8. Chose from File+profiles "5!!!" or "Renko thv 5"

9. If you don't see the last two indicators on the bottom of your chart, just refresh chart using template for that pair.

************************* VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR NEWBEES WITH RENKO : *************************

If you are using RENKO for a first time, after you install my system, you will find missing candles and your chart will not looks like on this pictures.

That is why you don't have a history for M2 and M3 candles.

Hi Mihailo.

I have a problem with the m2 and m3 charts - only showing "waiting for update" ?

Just wait for tonight market to be open!

*****************  Renko Chart  **************************

Renko charts are price charts with rising and falling diagonal lines of boxes that are either red or blue (in my system). Renko charts are "time independent" charts that do not have constantly spaced time axes. Down is an example of a Renko chart

The word "Renko" comes from "Renga", the Japanese word for "brick". The filled and hollow squares that make up a Renko chart are often referred to as "bricks." Renko charts were popularized by Steve Nison in his book Beyond Candlesticks.

Renko charts have a pre-determined "Brick Size" that is used to determine when new bricks are added to the chart. If prices move more than the Brick Size above the top (or below the bottom) of the last brick on the chart, a new brick is added in the next chart column. Blue bricks are added if prices are rising. Red bricks are added if prices are falling. Only one type of brick can be added per time period. Bricks are always with their corners touching and no more than one brick may occupy each chart column.

It's important to note that prices may exceed the top (or bottom) of the current brick. Again, new bricks are only added when prices completely "fill" the brick. For example, for a 5-point chart, if prices rise from 98 to 102, the blue brick that goes from 95 to 100 is added to the chart BUT the blue brick that goes from 100 to 105 is NOT DRAWN. The Renko chart will give the impression that prices stopped at 100.

It's also important to remember that Renko charts may not change for several time periods. Prices have to rise or fall "significantly" in order for bricks to be added.

Interpretation

Blue bricks are bullish, red bricks are bearish - that's the simplest interpretation of Renko charts. Renko charts may be most useful in identifying trends and trend direction. Because they screen out moves that are less than the Brick size, trends are much easier to spot and follow.

Hi Mihailo !

Congratulations for the new thread, a very good idea !

Could you please write the rules for enter / exit ?

The most important thing, how you make your technical analyse on the superior tf's ?

I don't see a SL, what is your stop loss ?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thanks Fishman356. I attached the tick simulator to the 1m charts. Works like a charm.

And a big thanks to Mihailo for sharing.

Well

I've been studying Renko for the last 3 yrs and I know Cobra THV sys VERY well.

I'm active  in almost all the threads where "RENKO" name is shown

so I'm happy Mihailo opened its own thread

I love Renko but it's not very suitable to my trading style (demanding job here)

I know Renko LIVE trading can be very frustrating,so any help or hints from Mihailo is much appreciated.

Miahilo is ONE OF THE FEW TRADER showing his Trade statement on FF

ok, count me in

Hi Mihailo,

Thank you for your work at FF. It seems a very good system.

I have a question, does this EA send orders automatically or manual?

Regards,

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I Believe this is a Manual System that generates Signals for you to Trade upon, but there may be an Automated EA based on this System of Mihailo's one day in the future,  from what i know at the moment , it is Manual System that will generate Signals.....i am sure it would depend on if Mihailo decided to do that, i think Mihailo is most likely sleeping by now, not sure.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
There is still no manual written/published by Mihailo yet or am I wrong?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
is not yet published ......................I think...........but is nearly.

Yes! Sorry: copy - paste

I'll add it to the first post

***************** VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR NEWBEES WITH RENKO *****************

If you are using RENKO for a first time, after you install my system, you will find missing candles like on this picture.

That is why you don't have history for M2 and M3 candles.

Every Friday I will post my history on the post nr. 1 so you can see charts normally.

Please extract History file and copy content in the history+your broker name folder in your Mt4 folder.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Whish you the best,I just pop in from another fx forum from southeastern europe.Boy,well said Mihailo,dark middle ages!Now I'm not big fan of lower tf's but this is promising.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Dobrodošao!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Don't copy history. Every broker has his time of trading and copying history will mess all up.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Mihailo,

Thank you for this excelent manual and trading system.

Special thank you for your spanish version of the manual.

I have revised the spanish version and include minor changes. Here is the revised file.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I'm not sure about that...

I'm using same history for few different brokers... everything works cool...

Maybe for some brokers not... don't know!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Mihailo, the version of Parrondo it's best of my......take the Parrondo Version Spanish Manual.

Hello everyone this is my first post on the FF.

J started trading with thv  a year ago and must say the system is good.Renko combined with ThV think that everything will be easier.Chart is cleaner and all you need is in one place. Full support for efforts Mihailo.

@ Milhailo

I had to remove the minicharts cause they are killing my cpu

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I must say the lower indicator looks different in the later picture in relation the previous one.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
EXCELLENT!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
You dont need it!

Its just my nostalgie fot THV!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Its because I didnt refresh it before I took a picture!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
minicharts are not necessary?

trix as used ?....... oversold and overbuy?..........and the lines are crosses it's moment to buy/sell.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
you should look at higher tf H1 and H4. this will help you to find stron s&r wich are very important for any kind of trading. scalping without any knowlage about PA doesnt work, doesnt matter which system y use.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Minicharts are here just to make trade easy and to be confident in your decision.

Basic tools are Coral, Cloud,Trix and red or blue blocks.

Everything is in the manual!

Just for example:

How many times did you trade oversold or overbuy positive?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
No hiigher TFs !!!!

I made this system not to looks from chart to chart!

Im sick of it!

Everything that you need is on the one chart!

That is the point. To make trades simple!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Ok Mihailo,now I understand you.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Greetings Mihailo!

I don't believe I've ever posted on FF but been following various threads for past few years.  I wanted to create this post just to say hi and show my support.

I been reading the thread for a few days and have been using THV system for part of my trading for the past year or so.  After going over the system and studying your entry signals I got excited about the added probability of success with your method.  Tried a couple live trades with a small position size last night with Eur/Usd and both were winners! +26pips. I would post screenshots but my charts don't seem to be marking the entry and exit points.  Anyways, looks promising and thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Of course that you can use whatever you want, but for me, in renko system time candles gives confusion.

Its a different picture!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
This is how my today trades looks on time candles.

There is no sence !

Isnt it?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
And more!

This is EURUSD on H1 and M30.

Different isnt it?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Congrats!

Im happy that you like this system!

Just grab your trade with a right click from a list and drop it on your chart and it will appears.

GOOD LUCK!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
How did you go short here:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...24#post5110024

when price is above coral?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
In this post I compared renko with the time candles

On previus post when I show renko, it was a signal to take short, in last one on H1 and M30 there is no signal. That is the difference between RENKO and classic candle

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Cheers! I didn't know you could do that.  Here are a couple I traded last night and this morning.  First one I exited too early but both winners!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
"In this...."  "in last... "  - I don't get you.

Both charts look the same.

I don't see any diifferences.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Renko one and classic one.

Same place different look!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Looks Good!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hello everyone,

I'm trying to anticipate the signal input (for long or short) through the intersection with:

3 Smoothed MA/close/0 shift = gold

8 SmoothedMA/close/0 shift  = violet

After the appearance of the arrow (with indicator 2MA crossover) await confirmation with at least 3 blue blocks for the long (red for short).

TP 20 pips

SL 20 pips  or the first HA candle  of opposite color

I have not evidence, because it is only today that I made ​​the change, try it yourself

Mihailo what do you think about it?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
It will be almost the same time as my signal... You have to take more history data for that kind of trade to see if there is more profit. I think that there is no much difference.

If you feel much comfortable with it, GO ON!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Good!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I can add 15 pips more!

71 today!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi Mihailo,

I have been trading with your system and I must say it is very effective.

I would like to know if you could include automatic trades capabilities. I know it could not be so easy because some of the block indicators may be repainting in the open candle but system is simple enough to be very eficient sending good trades with some time limitations (and other corrections or filters) to avoid flat markets.

Regards

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi Mihailo,

thanks for the great you are doing,

I am trying this system out but when i load the profile, and go on eurusdm2 offline the price and time is not updating.

is that normal?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Please read manual!

USE ONLY M3 CHART FOR TRADING NOT M2

Check expert advisors on the upper bar to be green not red

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Well...

I made an EA but....

If u can avoid flat market u have The Holly Grail!

EA doesnt have a mind and feelings... Also EA doesnt have wide picture. EA can not pull trend lines and make decision as u can.

For me  EA is a pure machine, or Im not so good in coding to create such a perfect EA wich will decide will PA broke trend line or not. Will bounce from S&R lines or not....

In last few years I made few EAs and find a tones of others. There is no EA that makes profit. Maybe there is but i didnt find it.

Just give me the paramethers and I will code it for u and we will see...

--- 帖子 #105 ---
sorry my mistake I meant the M3, the EA is enabled also. I'm using IBFX and the date is remainig 4th november!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Mihailo is it posible for you to make a short clip i youtube how you set up your mt4 from scrach so we can see how your doing it coz i've tryd everey thing from your first post and manual and i cant manage to set up my mt4 to trade

Well,

In my opinion, OB & OS zones are signals to wait. I'm not entering any trade in that zones. Just waiting to see in witch direction PA will go.

It is much better to miss a good trade than enter a bad one!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Ok, but how do you see OB and OS on your charts?

Mihailo...i would like to ask if it is possible to Add Arrow Signals to the Main Chart for the Coral Color Change, when i look at the file for Coral it is .ex4, so i do not think i can do it.

If possible could someone be able to Add Arrows on Main screen for Color change for Coral Indicator?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #131 ---
it doesnt matter which colour it is. PA is below or above the coral. dont use it like a s&r. Its just to show you the direction

--- 帖子 #132 ---

Overbought & Oversold

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thanks friend!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Excellent entry!

When the chart goes blue that means that trix crosses zero line and PA crosses Coral.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
There is no correlation between Coral change and entry signal, but if you want to do it I will send you Coral on your email.

The hardest thing is to determine Stop....

Mine is about 50 pips relay on a sense much than S&R lines.

I dont like to entering the trade next to the main lines, but if you look at the chart every 20 or 30 pips is some kind of a line.... camarila, midlines, qwoterlines, daily lines, weekly lines, monthly lines....

I dont know

Ok.

...............in one the last post 2 years a go.............you tell: when the market is flat it's hour to put limit orders in the break's.............now, it is correct?

Yes you are right about stops but it is out of topic here

Can someone explain me why not entering Short today on both examples marked in vertical yellow lines?

These cases are examples of trading Short by all conditions as explained by Mihailo. Why shouldn't anyone enter Short there?

Mihailo have you trade other forex pairs from this /GBPUSD EURUSD EURJPY/ with your system

What was the result ?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes you can use it on other pairs. I was trading GBPJPY, USDCAD, USDJPY... But, for me, it is hard to handle more than 3 pairs.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
done that, but it will only show the intro message again but will not update,

if i apply the template to a new chart, like eurusdM1 it will get updated but it's not the way to be used.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Mihailo, y should do a youtube video to make clear how to set chart correctly

Go to indicators list and enter properties of "5 signal" and change intro to false.

Ok, I have made a fresh installation, and opened a demo account and work perfectly, and the charts are named correctly.

The problem is that when I open my account which is a Mini Account, the Instruments change the name to EURUSDm etc. and the system will not work. is there a way to change from where it collects the Data?

Sorry for the trouble Mihailo.

mihailo,

very nice renko system. thanks for posting this.

you said because of a flat market cant make an Ea out of this, but if this was the case then why copy protect the indicators you make?

i am honest to you i wanted to try out to make an Ea out of this and see how it would work, but very hard to do when your indicators are protected.

that said awesome work on the strategy. makign a good working strategy for renko aint easy.

congrats

Hello Mihailo.  Thanks for sharing your system.

When I load your template, I get recurring error messages in the experts/log file looking for the two subject files.  Where do I find executables "3 s.exe" and "3 sm.exe"?

Thanks again for sharing.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I didnt post open indicators because there is always kind of people who will want to change something in my indicators. Than they post indcator and ask: "What do you think about this, this and this ....". I tried everything and have results with indicators like they are. Maybe I'm little "strange" but useless conversations make me nervous... So if someone wants my indicators just send me a PM and I will send it on a mail, but don't bother with changes... and questions "Why?, How?...."

Regards

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW I forgot to put them in the "Paket 5!!

Sorry,sorry,sorry,sorry,sorry,sorry,sorry,sorry,sorry.....

This two indies are not going on the chart.... You just need to have it in your experts+indicators folder. "13 Complex" use them!

Many pips to all!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
One of two problems might cause your problem:

1.  Go to the experts/log file and open it (go to experts/log/compatibility mode if you have a compatibility mode).  If the file is hugh, go down the text until you see a repeating line that tells you what file is not in your experts/indicators directory.  Load the missing file into the experts directory.

2.  Make sure you have the latest version of MT4 -- you should have Build 409.  Mihailo did the final compile on this indi and I do not know which Build he compiled with.  I would guess it is Build 409.

One of these two issues should correct your problem.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Please note that all I did was take Milailo's indicators and integrate them into a single indicator.  The credit for this system goes to Mihailo.  I sent the source code to Mihailo so that he could check it -- I had some questions regarding the interpretation of the code, and gave Mihailo permission to post the indi if he thought there was value in it.

As an aside, I have a reasonable igo -- you have to have one to survive in today's world.  But I did not name the indi after my trade name.  I actually named it "MihailoSignalsv1.0", which gives the credit where it is due.  Mihailo renamed the indi when he posted it to the thread..

The good news for all is that it produces nice signals that are easy to spot and read.  And it may increase the performance of your system when trading multiple pairs.  One of the problems with Renko is performance.  After you produce the bricks on the offline chart, you still have to run all your indicators.  Anyone who has used Renko extensively realizes that you sometimes can run no more than 3 or 4 charts simultaneously.

Anyway, thanks Mihailo for a great strategy, and good trading to all.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Thank's  I will try to do this .

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Good morning all.

Mihailo, I notice that in the version of EasyRyderSignals.v1.0 that you posted, you have set the defaults for "Coral_Filter" and "Complex_Filter" to false.  I understand setting Coral to false, since the other functions already include a Coral filter.  Is it your recommendtation that we not use the "Complex_Filter"?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hello Mihailo and all!!!

This is my first post on this forum, so i just wanted to firstly thank Mihailo for his great system.

Ive been trading for a few years now and have been trading some renko and time charts. Although renko is great for trend trading i found it terrible when it came to the execution.

So ive been using the new combined signal that easyryder developed and the flat indicator, and i can say that it is very effective.

I can honestly say that the chart setup you developed Mihailo is the best for both trend and Price action i have ever seen.

The filters are great and i can see that using this setup with a basic retracement continuation strategy would be of great value as the market waves are very identifiable with HA and renko combo.

I will post some of my trades in the future and would love to be here for an after market discussion of the weeks trades.

thanks again

regards Jon

--- 帖子 #245 ---
This definition of Renko chart is INCORRECT.  Renko charts, as defined in Steve Nison's "Beyond Candlesticks" book, are based entirely on CLOSING price.  New bricks are *NOT* added every time price moves the "Brick Size", they are only added if the CLOSING PRICE is above/below the last brick open/close by the brick size.  It's possible to add multiple bricks at once.  For example, with brick size = 50 pips and the last brick being a BULLISH brick with a close of 1.4000, no new bricks get added above the current brick unless there is a CLOSING PRICE >= 1.4050.  If price goes above 1.4050 but pulls back to below 1.4050 at the close, no new brick is added.  If the next close is 1.4102, two BULLISH bricks get added at once.  What you are describing is something else, that's not Renko (even though the chart looks like a Renko chart).

--- 帖子 #246 ---
That is a valid point, especially when trying to back test renko systems as the ticks project differantly all the time depending on the 1 minute data.

However do you think it affects this system at all? what are your thoughts on this system? anything positive?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I will try answer. If it's wrong then correct me Mihailo please.

First of all you should open 2 new charts M1 for AUDUSD. In the first chart add expert advisor RenkoLiveChart_v3.3 with settings 13 0 2 and in the second one RenkoLiveChart_v3.3 with settings 5 0 3. Expert advisor must smile ))).

After that go to menu of MT4 in File -> Open offline and find AUDUSD2 with double click and after that the same AUDUSD3 with double click.

And you should apply template for chart AUDUSD3 offline.

That's all! Have a good trading with others pairs!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
yes, take another clean chart in H4 and look for strong s&r. this will help y to make better trades. many green pips mate

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I think this system was developed with an indicator that has bugs as it relates to Renko charts, it's not drawing a Renko chart.  The indicator is basically drawing something closer to a RANGE BAR (although not a true Range Bar) and making it look like a Renko chart.   That being said, if the system is working with the indicator as is, then that's o.k. as the goal is to make money.  To be honest, I have not studied the system so can't say if it is good one way or the the other.  There are several threads on FF stating they are using Renko when they are not, anyone that understands Renko and doesn't know how to read the MQL source code is being mis-led about the charting methodology being used.

Using M1 data is probably your best bet if you are drawing RANGE BARS (much like the "Renko" indi used here).  However, in true Renko, using M1 data will subject you to the same "noise" you see on a candle or bar chart.  There will be more bricks and more changes of direction leading to increased whipsaws.  Renko charts were initially developed for DAILY pricing so, IMO, they are far less effective on the smaller timeframes, just as candle signals are less effective due to the increased noise.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I am agree for this steps you described

but i am on about the tamplate wich tamplate to aplay ther is only RenkoTHVEUR ...... GBP and .......... JPY

nothing else for the rest pairs

--- 帖子 #255 ---
HI friend!

Sorry for slow respond

1. Open two m1 charts of pair that zou want to trade.

2. On first one apply Template M2

3. On first one apply template M3

4. Open offline chart M2

5. Open offline chart M3, aplly Renko Thv template

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Welcome!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I took definition from investopedia.

But you are wrong too.

There is no case when two bricks will be added

In case that you are talking about when price will be 1.4102 only one brick will be added and second will be as growing or shrinking brick.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Excellent explanation but I didn't read it before I answered!

THANK YOU!

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Great man!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
There is no mater witch one will you use. When you use it you will see some strange data on minicharts like name from a diferent pair.

Delete it and save it whit name of a pair that you use. Than use it for refreshing a chart!

GL!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I think that you talk about previous versions of RENKO bars without wicks. Range Bars indicator is drawing blocks every 5 or 15 pips as you set and there can be two same blocks next to each other.

Anyway it doesnt mater absolutely.

This system works!

You can call it whatever you like!

Have a nice day!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
HI mate!

Nice trading today!

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Well my friends....

For everyone who worships EasyRyders signals there is a new version.

In this version he added 13 Stochastic and Coral for M2 Renko box 13 pips

Look at picture 100% success on todays signals!

Version 1.0 have 69 %

If you use 15 pips for TP and 25 for Sl

Version 1.0  35 pips

Version 1.1  95 pips

FANTASTIC!

Thanks a lot EasyRyder!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
And I forgot!

You will have to wait for few days to collect history data for RENKO bars!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
hey Mihailo

this indicator is only for 13pip setup? I prefer 5 for my trading. Nice work Easy, you are da man

--- 帖子 #266 ---
You read my mind!!!!! this is great Mihailo and easyryder!!

Oh and just a word on some previous negative input about the particulars of renko.........I personally think that manually trading renko of any size is extremely powerfull no matter what your opinion on the tick interpretation is!

However its when you make a Renko Ea that things start to fall apart.

I find it amazing how people on forums are so critical and come accross spoilt when they are givin so much usefull free tools and information!!

I say take whats valuable, discard whats not, but dont insult those who are trying to help

Sorry ive wanted to say that for ages...........

anyway enough of that crap, lets trade

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Im pretty sure that it will pick up on the 5 bar M2 aswell as it just reads the price in relation to the coral, so any size bar should work.

Yeah iv found that the 5 bar can be a good filter too

--- 帖子 #268 ---
you are right man, thx

--- 帖子 #269 ---
No its for 5pips trading.

EURUSD3.. At the bottom of all indicators..

My chart not the same as yous but it doesn't matter for question about EasyRider 1.1

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Yes it does cos there is no data that V1.1 use. Stratman minichart is settled at M3 - unusefull. Set it on M2.

You changed something in the sttings of easyryder

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi guys,

I´m trying out Mihailo´s system with pretty good results. Thanks for your great worl Mihailo!

Can you help me? Why am I not getting any blue bars in EasyRider 1.1 if EURUSD M3 Renko chart is showing above Coral?.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi!

Setup is not good Use ONLY M3 for trading and templates that I posted than add EasyRyder.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi to all!

Let mi explain something about EasyRyderSignals!

This indicator if you check Coral_Filter on true and set Coral_TimeFrame on 2 shows us indication if PA on Renko box 13 pips is below or above Coral line. This is one of the main rules in my system. That is why we have Stratmans minichart with M2 on the main window.

Price that you have to pay is that you will miss some good trades when there is drastic change of the trend like today.

Pa on M2 can not so fast cross Coral as on M3 so you will miss that trade.

There is no perfect trading system.  Sometimes you have to relay on your knowledge, experience or instinct to recognize trend change and enter the trade like it was today.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
In your last template renko thv.tpl sets M3.

There are default settings in my EasyRider 1.1

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I think that price on the minichart M2 was stoped. Please, check it: move cursor of mouse on the last renko-bar of minichart and you can see popup-window with price.. Price is something 1.34... but now price is 1.35... I think that something happened with Stratmans minichart M2 or with data for it.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Wooooooow my mistake!

PLEASE DONT use it.

I made changes! Now is OK!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
NO!

When you do that it shows you price on main window as position of the graf (lok at picture and yellow line label)

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Mihailo, I am trading both ways: With Coral Filter on and off. So far, results are much better with Coral filter off. I feel there are enough Coral filters built in the other indicators that compose EasyRyder 1.1, so maybe Coral is not needed. It is too early to tell. I will give you more info with future trading experience.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Just whipped this one up, take a look.

The first picture shows the easyryder v1 on top and the v1.1 on the bottom.

both have standard settings but no kumo filter.

the first windows shows the signals if the M2 filter was for a 5 pip renko strathman chart (as felixfx uses)

the second window shows the new v1.1 with the M2 13 renko coral filter.

the results for the last 24 hrs that have

both indicators concurring are as follow:

trades:1,2,7,11,12,and 13 are all winners with 15 pips profit targets met.

trade 6 was a loss or breakeven if you moved your stop up after 7 pips.

trade 14 was a loss.

results with just v1 (5 renko statman chart)

trades: 4,15,16 where winners with 15 pip profit targets.

trades: 3,5,8,9,10 where shady which would loose 100 pips or breakeven if you moved your stop up after 5-7 pips in profit.

The second chart is the same but with the trix filter turned off of both indicators, this seems to give a good continuation signal and i think could be applied as a re-entry signal or taking just one of these in between the major signals.

I just took trade 16 with a happy 15 pips profit even though it went another 50 after that  it was a good setup though nonetheless.

so to sum it up i think that with the more common trade signals, a previous consolidation period or at least 1 or 2 opposite HA bars is a good filter, as im noticing a pattern of loosing trades due to entering to long after the previous swing.

--- 帖子 #284 ---

Why renko-bars M2 so inertional? Because settings are 13 0 5?

Our trend is dawn see M2 chart.

In this case we had up trend in M3 chart,which we call counter trend.

At the end of this counter trend we had bearish divergence.It is a chance to return to trend in our case its move dawn.I admit I was a little rushed but  am 100% sure because I followed the JPY and the same happened and there.Sorry if this deviates from the rules

--- 帖子 #302 ---
you should look at one, max two pairs. you always trade pro USD or contra USD. take the trade that looks best. doent make sense to trade everywhere. be like a sniper and wait for the best setup.

greets to russia, will be in moscow in january

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Thank you Felix. I tried these trades on demo. GBPUSD looks good more then others. We will see. Ohh.. Are you will be in Moscow in January? Really? As tourist or business trip?

For me the system works very well and I am very pleased.

Today I have collected 150 pips in 5 simple trade.

Good luck to everyone.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
every night I dream about hunting this pips

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Just dream!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
With so many changes I have already lost.

Someone can tell me what are the correct including stoploss and Profit??

--- 帖子 #309 ---
.........................I mean the Easyrider v1.1.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Do not dream. Take a Little time and study the market in Mihailo sistem.Things here are very clear because we have Renko chart which helps us to determine where is Trending market and where is Ranging.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
yes my friend, it was just a joke  Im doin fine so far

--- 帖子 #312 ---
If it was a joke

what really your dream  Russian girl or what ?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Lets say 15/25!

--- 帖子 #314 ---
hey mihailo, how was your day?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Maybe it is too early but this will be as a dessert for those who like to trade with system but not scalping!

This is THE "Renko thv 13" system.

This came up from the "5!" system. In combination with H1, H4 and renko box 34 pips giving us excellent Daily signals for 40 to 100 pips each.

Extract file "Profile.rar" on your desktop.

Copy "Renko thv 13" folder to your Mt4 profiles folder.

Copy templates to your Mt4 templates folder.

Start your platform and go to File+profiles and chose "Renko thv 13" profile and trade!

GOOD LUCK TO ALL!

--- 帖子 #316 ---
44 pips!

I am pleased!

You?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
aboutn 15pips but for me its oki  got same mm as you bro

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Mihailo.............is necesary put in chart Minut 1 Renko (34) - M2)?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
No you have it in EasyRyder signal so you dont need it.

Just wait for a signal.

Or you can add m2 instead of H1 on minicharts!

--- 帖子 #320 ---
oki it works now. first I set "5", after changed to "13"

this is how it should look like?

oki works fine now, thx

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Good morning Mihailo and company:

I can not see on the graph co Stratman_MiniChart_v20, why is that? Thank you.

(translated to "translate.google.es")

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Your stratman chart is set to M3 Not M2!!!

im pretty sure this question has been answered by mihailo many times

so ill let mihailo take a breath on this one..

yea man just follow the installation manual precisely and you should have no problems,  just change it to M2 in the statman settings

--- 帖子 #323 ---
And install font "Stratman" to windows+fonts !

--- 帖子 #324 ---
good morning all. Im looking for the long setups only for the moment

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I agree with you but we have to wait a little more confirmation, I think 1.3550 is min target for long.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Yeah, Renko bars are awesome, especially if you combine them with higher time frame.

Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #327 ---
you did not say that, did you ?

you cant combine renko with bigger time frame darling !!!

!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #328 ---
why not?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Do you have eyes? This short video was not clear enough for you?

Indeed Renko bars don't have time frame, but higher time frame  for example 60 minutes do have several Renko bars inside, right "darling"?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Would you show your trades? Maybe without pics.. only time pair price close.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thank you a lot Mihailo! You did a good job!

"Just wait for a signal." (Mihailo)

Should I wait signal from EasyRider?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but according to Post #1, you did not mention on which Time Frame should  a user open the chart.

Maybe this is the reason so many users ask about chart configuration which does not work for them.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
My trades now. All gave the signals. EURJPY is signaling to sell now. EUR AUD GBP some minutes before.

What do you think guy? What are your trades today?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Don't worry about timeframe. In the post #1 you can see profile. All charts open automatucaly. Charts with name ......,M3 (offline) are used for trading

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Prices going a little up. We see special long shadow and blue HA-bar is appear.. So.. I closed all trades and am waiting the signal of continuing of trend..

--- 帖子 #336 ---
All charts open automatically only if you open saved profile.

I do not see any profile sent by the author.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
i have made an EA for the new indicator 13 EasyRyderSignals.v1.1 which is using iCustom funkction an it buys when blue bar on the indicator appears and sells when red.

But there is one issue, the indicator has blue or red bars everytime if the conditions are met, not only the first bar. so the EA keep buying or selling.

If it is possible to add to this EA the risk module for money management and the Martingale (after SL double the lots on the next trade), it would be great.

i am posting the EA to make the improvements

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Yes!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
If you are talking to me, and I think you are.... There is no opening charts in my system... Charts are settled and you only need to choose the profile and everything will be done automatic.

If I have to explain somebody how to open 12 charts for the setup it will be much worse.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Excellent trade !

--- 帖子 #341 ---
You just need to code it to buy when appears blue after gray block and sell when appears red after gray block!

That will means to buy on first Blue and sell on first red!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
i know, but i cant do it. i am not a good programmer.... only something like copy and paste from other MQ4 code

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I will try!

--- 帖子 #344 ---
1.and when there is no grey block and it changes directly from red to blue?

why not just check for "from not red to red" or "from not blue to blue"?

2.or just prevent multiple positions (actual position "long"= only short orders allowed). i think " YourExpertAdviser "-compiler has a build in function to do that.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
There is no situation from red to blue or revers !

--- 帖子 #346 ---
You're wrong.

Your charts are not 5 min or 15 min, they look like offline charts.

You did not mention that.

No profile is in your paket5! file.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
ok, that means i didn´t understand the difference between your original system and "13" ...

--- 帖子 #348 ---
What is wrong with you?

This is RENKO!

Charts ARE OFFLINE!

Please extract "Paket 5!.rar" and you will find profiles!

Read Manual and dont you ever ask questions that are answered!

--- 帖子 #349 ---
EDIT

--- 帖子 #350 ---
???

--- 帖子 #351 ---
hi Mihailo

i have a problem attaching easyridersignals to my charts

do you have any idea why - it is not showing eny thing on the chart and the expert is remuvet from the Mt4 strait away

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I will set the chart but I am afraid that you will criticize and say that trade is not with the rules. Ok. I am trying to test the system and compare with my work so far.

I trade about a year and I started with ThV sistem.Thv system is good but a little pips can be taken with a trade.

Renko THV seems different. The same rules but more pips.I noticed that the longer I stay in the trend.

I have opened a chart m2 (13) block, and  used to study and draw lines. I use this chart to see what the structure of the market trending or ranging (very important) and marks that.

M3 ( 5 ) block enter to trade

I have another chart 5 min with normal candles which  RSI indicator

and only look at the pin bar and divergence will explain later.

Now see the first  Trade 39 .we had the dawn trend and pa made   retrace or back to coral 55 yellow.

See trix you have arrows it s overbot ,and that's a signal that the retrace perhaps closer to the end. We expect that the price could fall. I then went to the m3 and m5 to see what was going on and saw a nice pin bar  and divergence in the M5. Then I put SL above the pin and so decided to get into the trade.Later seen in m3 that is too early.

18 and 39  pay attention to slow trix held in the upper half of the signs will continue to Trade

-39  Mistake

80  We were in Ranging Market yelow lines I think we were at the bottom and I tried risked 20 pips

In short it is

Again to say that the only test I'm sorry if trades are not the rules but really  Renko Chart 5 and Chart 13 are a good combination. I will continue to trade with these charts.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi Mihailo,

Right now there are templates for Eurusd, Gbpusd, Eurjpy.  When you have a chance, please make a template for Audusd, Nzdusd, Usdchf, as I trade these pairs more than the others.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I dont get all these people that are like " do this for me, make this for me, tell how i should do this etc"

Cant you make the template yourself? youve been spoon fed enough, this forum is turning into a bitch session!! if you cant work it out yourself with all the info already givin then you will probably never succeed at trading.

can we talk about the system and the trades taken?

(sorry for the honesty but this is getting frustrating)

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Excuse me, but you are the one bitchin!

I know how to modify indicators and I know how to create templates and I know how to modify an ea.  But when all the indicators are encoded, they cannot be modified, except by the creator.  I did create a template for the Audusd, but the headings still have Eurusd.  Mihailo knows this, that is why he created several templates for different pairs.

If you have nothing helpful to say, don't say anything at all!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I have something to say, thank you Mihailo... this is quite the system. Very impressive and really quite amazing. Thank you for sharing your hard work with all of us.

EDIT... now my prices have stopped moving...... any ideas? The M1 charts are still changing, but the M2s and M3s are no longer changing.

EDIT 2: Sorry, that was a stupid question, I restarted mt4 and forgot to click expert advisor again.  Sorry for the dumb question.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I think a very interesting and promising, it proves to demo and share my results in order to help and motivate each other to go out winners

I had a question out of curiosity to Mihailo and the rest of the people who have been using these weeks this great system ..

profitability as a percentage how much you can make this system by following the rules and trading day by day, week after week, month after month and good risk management? 30%? 50%? 70%?

sorry my English is not very good

--- 帖子 #358 ---
If the screen turns red, you enter a trade, and then the screen is not longer red... when do you think about getting out of a trade?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi guys!

Yes there is some problems with the setup that made me nervous long time until I didnt figured out!

Minicharts are made by Stratman and Im not su good coder to change that bug wich leaves names from the previous pair.

So, solution is:

1. Read post 260, after that right click anywhere on the main chart and go to the "Object list"

2. Delete all objects

3. Save the template with the name ofthe  pair wich you want to use.

4. Apply the template.

5. Wait few days to collect history for those pairs.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Please post a picture!

Some questions:

1) Did you trade 3 pairs only? EURUSD, EURJPY and GBPUSD?

2) Which hours (sessions) did you trade usually?

3) Which lot size did you use?

4) Did you use fix stoploss?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
20 pips on aud so far.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
1. Yes

2. Moscow, London, NewYork

3. 10k - 1 lot, 20k - 2 lots.......

4. No. Relay on my appreciation.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Thank you for your answers.

Could you more explain how you exit from position? Especially when this happend early. Do you use HA-candles for stop like for profit?

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I can go to my studio now!

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Спасибо.

As I watched your last picture: you use another template for your deals?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
yea your right, unfortunately i had to leave and let the trade either hit the SL or TP.

oh well on to the next

Nice trades by the way !

Im changing it all the time. Its boring to wait for signal and Im changing setup to find witch one suites me best.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
................as is the red arrows to see the trade??..................I don't see in my chart.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
If you think the red mark above the entry it s  Stop loss

Arows  above trix it's divergence .

Sometimes I see your charts and see that you also have something and I have

I think it depends on the broker and the time zone I'm not sure

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Thank`s.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Click HA properties / colors / change Royal blue for Lime.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I also did not know

Mihailo told me a few days ago

Otherwise I thought it was a secret tool that says " Enter here please"  "Get out here please"

--- 帖子 #409 ---
No Mihailo,  only pipware-chart-v.4.

fcesc 73, i couldn't do that...don't save

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Lime!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
jajaja thanks Mihailo but, the new indicator dont let me to open the mt4!!

xDD

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Take it out, update your mt4 and install it back.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Mihailo: thank you very much, the solution was what you said (And install font "Stratman" to windows + fonts!). I read the manual several times, the entire thread, but the mistake I made was to use the Windows clipboard (cut and paste) when I had to "install" the source. Maybe that explained in a post but understand me I read this in Traslate.google and you know that translates to "apache".

Jon618: sorry to have bothered you and others of this philanthropic forum. I had no other way forward. In Spain there is a saying: "He who does not cry, not breastfeeding."

Now I have another problem with 13 EasyRyderSignals.v1.1, I know I said Jon618 in "apache" read everything again. But it took 27 hours non-stop, without sleep, I read everything 3 times and can not find a solution or do not understand.

I tried to send a private message to EasyRyder not to disturb the thread but I can not, I forexfactory. So I have no choice but to ask here. I appeal to your humanity, and if deemed excessive rechácenme, I'm just as grateful, really.

EasyRyder: Hi, this is the problem:

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Maybe some help

When you synchronize m3 and m2 chart and make a decision where to enter the trade do not forget

you must have HH HL in up trend

you must have LL LH in dawn trend

Marked by arrows ideal place to enter into trade

Up just after noted HL

Dawn just after noted the LH

looked at the condition of the m3 chart in the place where the arrow on m2 and seeing that at that time met the full requirements for entry into the trade.

cheers

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I think I finally understood the post 233 of EasyRyder. The problem is that my version of mt4 is old.

Have a nice Sunday. Thank you and forgive the inconvenience.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I have the same problem with the indicator as Aborigen does. The terminal freezes and I have to restart it. Suggestions?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Look in the menu bar MT4, in aid and about. There you will see the version you have. must be version 4.00-Build 409.

You have to download another 409 metatrader version.

Read the message 233

Thank you very much for the system Mihailo, it is very helpful for trade

the system is great. Thank you very much for sharing.

15 pips on the Asian session open.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yea the chart setup gives you a great visual understanding of trend and momentum continuation setups using your HH HL Flow.

this is kinda like the "floor trader method" or i think the top of the list is something that todd mitchell teaches which is the "market flow analysis method"  of Higher High's and Active Lows as an even more accurate and refined way of picking trend and swing points.

Ive been thinking of starting a new thread for this with renko as it is off topic of the current thread but feel that when combined with Mihailo's system could be extremely powerful.

--- 帖子 #425 ---

should have known a break out at this time is unlikely.

I do have MT4 ver. 409. Does not help...

--- 帖子 #430 ---
yea the same thing happens to me when i apply the profile to a new terminal etc.

ive found that you need to have sufficient history ,if thats not the problem and your just adding the indicator and it freezes then log out of the server and load the indicator and turn all the settings to false and log back in and if it doesnt freeze then start turning the inputs back to true and see which one is crashing the system, ive found the trix, complex and money flow can cause the problem.

My fix was to just take my time and make sure that the terminal is fully loaded before adding to much pressure to it. if this doesnt work then you might just have a slow computer????

hope this helps

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hello everybody!

I am a new comer in the  forum, I have read almost all Mihailo's threads and am trying my best to install it into my system, I have the new version of MT4, and I did downloaded history rar and packet rar 5 but after that I could not see Open File Location on it when I extracted.  Can anyone help me on this step by step, or do I find any youtube link.

Any help would be great but a.s.a.p.

thanks,

how u do like that.can u teach me?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
So.. I noted (not first time) that trader (me) should be disciplined and attentive.. I missed some good trades today in Europian session on EUR, EURJPY and got some loses ((( hm...  What yours trades today guys?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Do not force trades... wait for good signal, watch for all parameters

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Do you use EasyRider 1.1 for confirmation only?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Well....

This is how I look at trading:

First of all I'm trading on few pairs not to take all the money in the world but to find excellent signal.

Every pair gives us at least one ideal signal per day. I'm waiting for it!

If you catch one ideal signal per day and your tp is 15 to 25 pips you can make 350 - 550 pips a month.

That is a huge amount if you multiply with your lot.

What I mean upon IDEAL SIGNAL?

It is a signal that contains all parameters of my system.

LONG

1. PA is NEARLY above CLOUD and CORAL

2. PA on M2 is ABOVE CORAL.

3. Fast trix crosses slow trix near the zero line and they are NEARLY above the zero line.

4. ALL blocks on my tools are blue after gray blocks!

5. NO daily pivot line, trend line, support or resistance line near in 25 pips!

In this 3 signals on the pictures you can catch 45 pips. Good for one day!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Good afternoon to all:

This is the first time that I write in this forum and want firstly be grateful to Mihailo for share his amazing system. I've been reading all this posts and I opened a new account with a broker to test your system.

If you let me I want to participate with all of you and humbly share my thoughts and opinions.

Those are my trades for today.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Welcome man!

Nice trades!

Congrats!

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Greetings all.

Just got through the thread and got all my indicators loaded.  Read through the manual and anxious to get this up and running.

Quick question.  The manual says first signal is chart going red or blue.  Is that literally the case or do you just mean the "indicators" going red/blue.

Also it mentions the M2 being above/below the coral.  On my M2 there is no coral line at all...just a bar chart.  Do I need to add some indicator to it.

Thanks for the help and lets all post some trades so I can get the hang of it.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
The whole screen will literraly turn blue or red.

And as for the M2 chart... he is talking about the Stratman Mini chart V2 that is on the lower left of the main chart.  There should be a coral indicator on that little chart. You don't need to switch windows.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Thanks JM

Just found the M2.  I think I'll get rid of all the mini charts that clutter the screen.  Anyone finding them particularly useful???

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hey why do you need both an M2 and an M3?

What happens if I just apply the Renko Thv template to the M2? (I'm trying to set up AU, but can't open an offline M3 for some reason).  The template put on an M2 chart looks identical.. the bars are 5 pips.

Also, any disadvantage to removing the HA candles that you can think of?? I haven't had a problem so far, I find that they blur my vision of the price a bit too much.  I just wanted the creator's opinion however.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I take them off as well

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Welcome

Just do as it says in the post 260 and you will set AU.

M2 is to confirm the trend. there is no template for m2.

you can remove HA of course. Its up to you how do you feel good!

Hello Mihailo,

I have been trading with your system and I very like it.

I usually use 30M and 1HR timeframe to trading AU, but i don't understand "M2 M3 chart" is 2 and 3 minute timeframe?

I apply the renko thv template , and have some problem,please help me.THX

1,renko M2 is disappeared only,i think i missed your history file,but i don't trade ERUJPY ... so i changed the Stratman_MiniChart_v20 properties "TimeFrame" to M1, and renko show me the classic candle not the renko candle.

2,I try to change the minichart's timeframe to higher on bottom,but it can not refresh,default is ok.

Regards

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Thank You Mihailo very much for Your response. This was very good and detailed.

But I have another question: Do you trade one good deal in each pair per day?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Mihailo what do you think about these setups? (AUD and EUR against USD)

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Well....

1. Too far from Coral

2. Double bottom looks like strong support

This is not good enter, mayby for 5 - 6 pips and get out.

Im not by my PC and Im answering from my phone looking at your picture. My answer is not something that you can relay on.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Ooo.. Thank you. Very fast!

Do you trade when price cross Coral (or near from Coral) only?

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Now I have a clear picture!

As I told you in previous post. Both entries were bad.

1. To far from Coral!

2. You entered exactly on support lines.

3. All night trend is down. Wait for London to be open.

4. Enter on EU is not by the book bricks are in mess. Not red for a first time after grays.

As I told you for AU there was 5 pips.

Be patient, wait for clear signal.

I trade whenever i see a good entry!

Hi!

You can find all about my system here

If you are using RENKO for a first time, you can find everything here or here!

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hi to everyone!

There is more than 1500 downloads of "Paket 5!" system from post 1.

I assume that half of that must be different users... So more than 750 people install that system in their PCs and only a few of them having problems and cant do that.

People please READ post 1, THE MANUAL or THE INSTALLATION MANUAL

From now on I will ignore all posts with "I cant see this or that", " Why is letters instead of line", "What is M2 or M3", " Why not m1, or m30 or something".

Please discuss only about system and trading!

Thank you all!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Thats the way to go!

Поздравляем!

--- 帖子 #472 ---
20pip a day *5 =100pip

100pip * 4 = 400 pips each month. if y take good mm like Mihailo do, its enough

--- 帖子 #473 ---
good morning mihailo, good morning thv renko traders

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Think you,Mihailo.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Morning bro!

How are you today?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
good afternoon from Australia!!!

Thank you mihailo for your opinion on entries, i have been looking at taking just those trade signals, and it seems to be the highest probability for profit.

I think what people will find hard about this, is the extreme discipline of just taking high probability trades and coping with watching potential profits being lost in front of there eyes!!

I think though that this is the key to success as many professional traders will tell you.

take good setups, take profits, have good money management and trade with discipline. easier said than done but i believe thats the holy grail!!!

so 1500 downloads!!! how is everyone finding the system??

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Excellent conclusion!

Look at the post 1 there is almost 1000 downloads and before my last edit of the paket 5! was around 550!

--- 帖子 #478 ---
for me I downloaded it 150times cause I like it so much

@Mihailo, I slept too long, missed this big move. Anyway the next trade will come

--- 帖子 #479 ---

Do you have such signal on your chart? I discovered that your values of indicators a little bit differnt from mine.. I want to compare..

--- 帖子 #484 ---
good morning to everyone here I present my latest operation became lost, any suggestions or opinions

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Well...I'm just learning this system myself, but one thing I notice is that the cross on the Trix line is not right.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Greetings to all here again I put another recent GBPUSD operation, this operation became lost as the previous one, follow all the parameters to enter, any suggestion or opinion Mihailo and other colleagues

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Almost the same happened to me on GU today. (but on previous crossing the price and coral downward). All the blocks were red, renco chart blocks were red and below the coral. Fast trix crossed slow near zero... etc... and price just tern back and SL опа ....

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Made the same mistakes.

1º a possible double bottom formation.

2º 13 MoneyFlowIndex BLUE (in my case)

3 º EasyRyderSignalv1.1 GREY (in my case)

4 º to 32 pips SL Estralimitar (only 3 pips above the fractal "F1") (by the way if you had put 35 pips above, it appears that the operation would have been saved).

5º and very interesting for me (I'm investigating whether inadequate RenkoAM good for something). The bar occupies RenkoAM B1 lasting 15 minutes. What could

tell us a long time for indecision or market equilibrium. This reminds me when Bollinger bands are tightened a lot, after the price jump shot and can not predict where.

You see you're not the only wrong with this, two of us (at least).

(translate.google)

--- 帖子 #489 ---
You have a different layout and configuration - values are the same.

Im not using 13 Complex....

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi friend!

I don't have that signal at my platform, but in that particular moment it can be that it wasrepainted during the candle.

Yes it looks like good entry but news was in few minutes in that case I will not trade.

As you marked on M2 PA is far away from coral. There must be some retracement.

Even if I would trade I will spread my sl. Its easy now to say that when we know that PA comes back and that trade become a winer but I explained that I use extended sl between 25 and 60 pips.

And of course that was reenter in a trend TP must be between 5 to 7 pipis

I must tell you all something. Some trades must be lost, even if signal is excellent. There is no Perfect system.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Hi again!

The Answer is almost the same as one before:

1. It is obviously range market Pa was hitting that point 3 times before as you can see on my picture as green line.

2. News around.

Not valid signal!

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hi!

Your enter is worse than his!

You entered one candle late, in that case your sl wil not be hitted.

Im not going to comment EasyRyder...

NOT GOOD AT ALL!

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Mihailo,

many thanks from London for your outstanding system, which is an astonishing development from the already fine THV system, but with an excellent twist.

I am using the old THV system since it came out a few years ago with great success and i like to share some experience with you all.

-trades, which are entered far away from the Coral are in my book called "reentries" and are the most difficult ones. I only take these occasionally, because of its rather worse risk vs reward ratio.

-the best trades are always around the Frankfurt and London opening, if the price has already a clear direction from the night session and we see some retracement back to or even above the coral.

-If price thereafter breaks through the coral and Trix crosses(fast/slow) or has just crossed the PA and the momentum is usually strong enough to deliver 15-25 pips without sweat.

-Things get more complicated after a big overnight move has already occured and price is far away from the coral and just kreeps up a bit, but not significant. Most SL action occurs on a sudden reversal during such trades. My advice is to avoid these(see the losers above), especially, if you are new to THV or to this great Renko system!

-A little tip: I am using the THV divergence indicator for trend confirmation on a 15 min chart. This prevents you to enter in the wrong direction or will confirm your trade, but is only an additional confirmation and NOT part of the system. It just gives me more confidence.

-From my experience, the good trades run much longer than you might think. Putting your TP too tight is good for your own confidence, but i like to suggest to take part of the profit off at 15 pips and simply let the rest run with a BE @+1-4. with that technique you lock in Profit and have no risk for the remainder part of your position

I will post my trades daily to discuss and hope to add some value to this already phemomenal thread.

TD

--- 帖子 #494 ---
thank you very much for your opinion to correct me, the more certain that the candle repainted and had to wait a little longer, and also by the news too,

I will trust much of Easyrider, only use the original indicators

continue to practice and practicing

--- 帖子 #495 ---
EXCELLENT TIPS!

Thanks for your rich experience!

Welcome, Im looking forward for your posts!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
colleagues, as I was commenting today in London and USA, which had results today, how many pips did...my english is not good

--- 帖子 #497 ---
If i may add some observations, which can easily confuse traders:

-If a trend move and a fresh signal is generated EasyRider1.1 gives a nice message and changes colour, but................

-...........sometimes after the next bar PA disappears, which can leave you with a trade with a vanished signal

-Here is what i do(I only trade GBP-USD, because this pair trends very nice):

From the good setups, we should all be already confident enough, that the price will move further than just 15 pips in almost 99% of all trades.

So it is not a bad idea to wait on riskier trades further away from the Coral(no matter M3 or M2) to just sit tight and wait for the second bar of EasyRider to maintain the colour.

Remember that a missed trade is much better than a stopped out one.....lol

-Be careful not to overtrade. This very system is such a beauty that at least i am glued to the screen waiting for the chips to cash in.

I am looking for 1 setup in the morning(London) and 1 in the afternoon(NY).

-Mihailo has said it already. Wait for a good setup and try to avoid the "soso" ones.

Before i forget.................it takes a few days until you have enough history to rely on the M3 charts.

Be very careful not to trade with an incomplete history!

TD

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Roger, Thanks.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Yes we see it...... and don't understand you.....

--- 帖子 #500 ---
I mean we all put our graphics with the pips obtained = D

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I entered this two trades just to explain how confident you must be in your knowledge and experience!

Support line S4 became resistance line.

It was so obvious that PA will bounce from that line!

Trix was in OS zone and divergence do her job!

I was a little bit impatient so I didnt wait for a few more minutes for first TP to bi hitted and I closed it manualy.

But, who cares, +27 pips.... That means +53 for today!

GL!

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Welcome to this great thread! Very good that traders with experience joins this one. Because it is very important for all new traders (as me) in this strategy

--- 帖子 #503 ---
What do you think guys about this signal?

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I have taken the same short, but it is a risky one, because Trix cross occured earlier and M3 Trix is still in uptrend.

Put a tight eye on it.

My target is max. 15 pips.

TD

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Can you upload template from this post?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
td and abc, hope y go out with some pips. was risky short

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi!

Here is tpl!

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Yes, I went out with -9 pips on GBP.. Why do you think that this trade risky? Because GBP has moving before that?...

---

And I missed this trade on AUDUSD (see pic).

What do you think about this trade guys? Is it was risky also because PA was far from M3 Coral?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Ìèõàèë, I need 2 files:

2011.11.24 15:43:20 Cannot open file 'Erogram FilesMetaTrader Finamexpertsindicators13 Stochastic.ex4' on the EURUSD,M3

2011.11.24 15:43:19 Cannot open file 'Erogram FilesMetaTrader Finamexpertsindicators5 SignalE.ex4' on the EURUSD,M3

--- 帖子 #510 ---
In my humble opinion, the signal was far behind the trix cross. The closer to the trix cross, the more reliable the signal.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Here they are!

--- 帖子 #512 ---
This was not valid signal at all!

1. Far away from cloud.

2. Fast trix far away from zero line.

3. PA on M2 is far away from Coral and uprising!

Not valid!

--- 帖子 #513 ---
It looks like something is wrong with your setup...

This was a valid signal.

1. Trix OK

2. M2 OK

3. Cloud OK

4. Little bit away from coral but this is an reenter and TP is <=10 pips!

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I ment signal on GBPUSD in this case.. not AUDUSD..

Sorry, I wrote not so undestanding post.. I ment 2 different trades: on GBP and after that on AUD

--- 帖子 #515 ---
... and what about this one?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
ups!

Sorry!

I took that same trade and went out now with +6

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Support line!

--- 帖子 #518 ---
What do you think about this enter? Not far from cross trix?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
is about 15 pips far from entry point to support line.. (and price did this move )))

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Wooow.. Your drowdown was about 40 pips! Is it normally for you?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I think this signal very simular as my on GBP in post 520.. I think that comments are not different..

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Your MoneyFlowIndex parameters are 13 0 but in the tpl-files in the post1 - 8 0...

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I hope we will see signal on EURUSD soon..

Be carefull - this is not valid signal but maybe..

----

Update: but AUDUSD wants to go UP soon (see pic2).. maybe.. hmm.. This is opposit signal against USD.. What do you think? What about Holiday in USA today? Is will be any good movements today?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
It was small lot size

Im always risking around 3% of account.

I was waiting to cross pivot line for a 12 points and than to close negative.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
I was testing something and accidentally save the template with MFI 13.

For me its better with 8... Change if you want and save the template with the new settings

--- 帖子 #526 ---
This is how I feel about Holidays....

I dont trade on holidays... just practicing with small lot.

When big traders are resting some trader from Iran can move the market!

You dont want that to be happend!

I dont trade on:

1. Bank holidays

2. Religious holidays in Orthodox and Catholic Christianity.

3. International holidays.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
GBP SELL signal

--- 帖子 #528 ---
This is not a sam e but similar as ABC trade before on GBP

1. M2 close to Coral and possible pull back down....

2. Far away from the cloud

3. Trix away from the zero line

4. 4th hit at the trend line

Im not sure that I would enter here. Maybe with small lot and for 5 - 7 pips just for fun!

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Could be a nice one! but not more than 13 - 15 pips!

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Why not more then 15 pips? How do you calculate your future profit?

For me: this was almost ideal signal. Maybe I am not right of course..

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Signal was ideal.... But today is holiday and you must be cautious!

--- 帖子 #532 ---
but movements of currency were very good! isn't it?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Yes it was, and that has no matter with being cautious!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Morning surprise!

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Europian session brings me some pips! Thanks

--- 帖子 #536 ---
perfect setup on the pound abc!!

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I think that not so perfect bcz not all blocks are red when I entered.. This was risky

--- 帖子 #538 ---
GBPUSD:

26 pips at 0.50 lot

36 pips at 0.50 lot

OIL:

10 pips at 2 lots

Not bad 30 mins. of work...

I think I can rest for today.

Good weekend to all.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
ok, yea the boxes weren't all red, but price came up to the top of the channel in lower lows and lower highs, and if you look at the trix setup of divergence followed by and cross of the fast and slow line, it was a very good indication of a short trade coming up.

im liking this system more and more!!!

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Thank your for your comment!

Is this one of the rules of classic THV system? (this is my question bcz I don't know classic THV so good.. only in general)

--- 帖子 #541 ---
... but how long are waiting these signals? (I think more then 30 mins))))

The disadvantage of this system (and almost all scalping system) is that we must seat near our monitors for a long time waiting the signal..

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Excelent!

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Fantasic!

--- 帖子 #544 ---
But it pays off! A LOT!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Of course!

Have a nice weekend to all! See next trading week!

Mihailo ,

Congratulations for the great system you've created and decided to trade with! I have some definite questions I came upon while reading the posts you've written and think that their answers are important in order to clear things out while choosing the right time to enter a market position.

First, as I understood part of your entry strategy in the market is when M2 chart bars are below or above the Coral but not too far from it, right???

Second, I saw some graphs that you posted in which your entry is not taken when all of the 5 lights-red or blue are in accordance but only 4 of them for example. If only part of them have to lighten up which ones do you preferably choose?

Third ,you say that a position does NOT have to be taken if take profit level of 10 or 15 pips is near a major supp/resistance level. Can you show some near term examples of such levels on let's say eur/usd, because every timeframe can give you different levels of importance. In your last post (the one above mine) I see a good market opportunity right below the 0.9710-0.9700 level. Do you wait for the price to cross it southwards or you enter before that???

Fourth, I saw that you trade after faster trix has already crossed the slow trix. Does fast trix has to first come from OB or OS level and cross the 0 level or it doesn't matter????

Fifth, I also saw that you take short or long positions only when HA candles on 15m TF are respectively below or above Coral. Am I right???

Thank you for the separated time and wish happy trading!

Greetings from Bulgaria.

Hi братко!

1. Below (short) or Above (long) and in the trend direction, more carefully if its to far!

2. Yes and its too risky... relayed on my experience.

3. I use daily Fibonachi pivots

4. It doesn't matter but can be a good point of wiew.

5. Doesn't matter

as I opened my workspace this morning I recognized a gap in my data (only on eurusd) from july23 till november24

I tried :

options --- complete history--- majors --- eurusd --- 1min --- download

that is opening a window that says: no new data for symbol "eurusd" do you want to convert all timeframes (but I see data from march till now there)

I answered that with no, because the gap in 60 min data is only 1 month and I don´t want to make things worse.

but anyway, all my charts/renkocharts look like piece of shit now.

has someone an idea how to fix that?

Yup, but it depends on trader how he set the indicator.

Also depends on broker but difference is around 3-5 pips!

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Nice trading day!

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Spred for gold in my 5-digits broker is 5000

(Forex-market), how trade???

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi replace this tool!

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hi Mihailo,

could you plz tell if my renko looks rigth,

to me it seems stopped

Thanks

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I dont know what is this... This is not my setup!

Please READ MANUAL!

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Not best setup because trix is far away from zero and cross is slow and PA little under Coral but hei! what big move! and my 20 TP was reached. What do you think  Mihailo is this a bit risk trade?

tks!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
OK, Michailo,

at last i managed to fix it all,

now will try your system,

Thanks again, sorry for bothering

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Finally I have  decide to register my profile to say really big respect to MIHAILO!

It's quite simple and profitable system. MIHAILO you are MAN!

My first trade at real account with this one system:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It was be able to enter little bit early but it was too close to Pivot and after i have been waiting for News. In 15 minutes after News the trend was the same and all indicators were for buy. So, SL=15 & TP=25. Well done!!!

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Welcome!

Very risky but ok... Alls well that ends well!

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Its quite ok , cos it was very strong momentum after one hour range very small risk.

I would take that trade but with tp 15!

as I said in post before - Alls well that ends well!

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Risky because too far from CORAL? Or why?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
yes the right entry was several bars before. timing > all

--- 帖子 #608 ---
But, it was time of NEWS...

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I've lost some pips
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I am absolutely sure all blocks were red , but they were change color immideately after my order...

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Bad day today!

I was too much secure on my self and enter on sell signal witch was not good!

News reacted much earlier than I espected. It was a split of second after I entered the trade... I didnt have a time to add Sl

So result is - 64 pips

I tried to cover that but I cover only a half.

You can not trade after shock... fear do his own!

Will be better tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hello,for a test of Mihailos system I opened a demoaccount. But it has a different timezone than my mt4-real account. To avoid confusion I would like to change the time settings of the demo, but couldn´t find any instructions.

1. is it possible to change the time? and how?

2.@ Mihailo:  I made an DAX30 tpl, is it ok for you if I post it here?

--- 帖子 #612 ---
It happens... Perhaps it's better you use an ea to manage your stop loss and your target price, I think it could help you when you open a trade .

--- 帖子 #613 ---
HI!

1. You can not!

2. Yes you can!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I do not know if I understand correctly. I use the EA THVcavemanager. This makes me a SL and TP when the position is open. After already on the market and with more time I can adjust the TP and SL. So do not run the risk of being run over by the market without SL.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Did you guys hear about drawing trendlines? It helps sometimes?!?

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Good day Mihailo. Actually I follow your thread since you begin it (even earlier, when you posted your method on the thread of Cobra). Probably I missed something. The question is How can I find M3 chart (I can't find it in off line) I mean for aud/usd e.g. I applied your tpl and it works perfect, but I want to trade some other pairs.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Trading yesterday was a heck of a ride - all kinds of signals and some great set ups.  I like these set ups so far!

i have uploaded these scripts, they have function to autocalc the lot size with risk ratio, auto put SL ant TP. they can be used too for LIMIT or STOP orders. i am using them with this system, after i hear the alert from easyrider. i asign the key shortcut for them, for example CTRL S - for sell and CTRL B - for buy.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
i didnt take this one, because the trix cross happened earlier...

--- 帖子 #624 ---
But Renko is above coral.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
The plan was to take 25pips but I stop it manually because of indicators change.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #626 ---
R U sure? Coral seems still blue to me, but price is below, Mihailo concur?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Mihailo, what about EasyRider and Flat?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Goood tool!

--- 帖子 #629 ---
In that moment when I took the trade both charts were under coral!

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Color of the coral is in decoration purposes only. No effect on trades!

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Easy was red in that moment and it repaints if PA goes in other direction during that candle.

Flat is additional tool and have not much effect on the trades!

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Look at the renko chart!

--- 帖子 #633 ---
No way!

It does not repaint.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
So you are break the rules? Sorry, I'm not up to speed with every little indicator with this system for entry; I was looking at coral on the price chart, are you saying the yellow is coral on Renko chart?

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Both charts are renko! Main and mini!

Main window is a renko chart with 5 pips a box and mini is a renko chart with 13 pips a box.

Yes it repaints, and it was below coral!

--- 帖子 #636 ---
In 1st page, 1st post you uploaded DOC file.You show there a few charts. All the charts pointing on the renko in the main chart that should be above for long and below for short. You never wrote that a trader should go for another chart to see the renko chart at its own with a different block size.

Did you change the rules?

Have you ever mentioned that your indicator repaints?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
EURUSD:

10 pips at 1 lot

-3 pips at 1 lot

GBPUSD:

30 pips at 1 lot

OIL:

20 pips at 1 lot

A total of 57 pips.

Thank you Mr. Mihailo. You have a great system and probably you are great too.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Mihailo, can I ask you to drscribe - How does EasyRider work?

I have compared results of ER signals with other indicator's step by step.

I have switched off all in ER (including Coral filter) except one indicator (for example "13 OsMacd") and compare with results of original.

Results were different. Take a look for this one example: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #639 ---
USA session start +15p!
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #640 ---
It is the same chart but bigger picture for you to see that PA was under coral!

Just look at candle when it is a signal and you will see that it repaints during the signal. I just didnt wait for candle to be closed under coral if it was closed Signal wouldnt be repainted. it was closed above coral and the candle was closed in gray.

Just use your brain a little...

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Thanks for the compliments! I am THE GREAT.... around 140 kilos!

JUST GO AHEAD!

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Yes and its only for OsMACD and I dont know why...

The data are the same for both indicators... I dont know

--- 帖子 #643 ---
And my clever brain understands that you trade as you want and not by your own rules in this thread.

allow --"PostMessageA from user32.dll"

is it rigth?

am not fluent in programming so a bit confused

Thanks

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Something wrong, try to install everything again from the start!

--- 帖子 #649 ---
The same situation with MoneyFlowIndex, FIM & Stochastic.

T3 & Complex are OK!

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Mihailo,

i reinstalled everything again, but problem remains.

Tell me, after copying all files as you gave on 1st page then opening template should i apply RenkoLiveChart_v3.3 to chart, rigth?

and RenkoLiveChart_3.3 parameters should be like in attached file, correct?

--- 帖子 #651 ---
No it is not correct !

Please follow the installation manual step by step!

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Tx!

--- 帖子 #653 ---
You must turn off early signal and than it will be the same!

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Mhailo,

Thanks for sharing this system with the members of this forum. I'm a new trader that has reached the point of opening a demo account - but I've hit a wall:

1. My Candle reading ability is improving but

2. I realized that I need a system better than my ONADA demo account to practice and develop my trading plan

3. Can you tell me the best broker that supplies MT4 platform (which I understand is very good). If necessary send me a private e-mail. I check out on my own.

4. Establishing my trading ability is a necessity not a reaction endeavor. The great part is that I am really enjoying the learning, the challlenge and the opportunity

5.  There is a chasm of information that is not available to new traders that I do not see being filled. Some of us just need a jump start so we can take a system like your Renko Thv and get in the game.

6. My goal was to use price action set-ups on the 1, 4 and day charts to provide more reaction time to manage the trade. But yoour system could really help me in identifying the trade set-up with more accuracy, etc.

7. Once I get your reply I'll follow your directions to set-up MT4 Trader platform.

Thanks again for your willingness to help - Helping people is what has put me, at what I hope is a temporary situation. I'm a firm believer in what goes around comes around. Thanks again.

CESO

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I think that this forum is becoming counter productive.

Mihailo as done us a great favour by sharing his system, templates, knowledge and support.

We should not be attacking our fellow traders about anything here (except for being rude), nor should we be demanding help and treating mihailo as our personal trading assistant!!

smillee's comment's are extremely rude and i wonder the character of such a person that spits in the face of someone that try's to help people without asking for fiscal reward. i deal with these blood suckers everyday at work, and to me they are vermin!!

Surely we as traders can understand that things arent always black and white with trade setups, thats why robots dont work consistently. trading to me is an art that is built around a system.

with that said i think mihailo's set up was 1 step away from perfect.

yes the M2 renko was not closed below the coral 55.

However there was a trix cross close to zero and then the trix had a retracement continuation setup which is very powerful!

just remember that indicators are lagging and i think mihailo has the experience to identify a high probability trade.

Mihailo your a legend, you have enhanced my trading 10fold!!!!

--- 帖子 #657 ---
thankyou ive been looking for a script that combines Risk %.

i downloaded  a script from mql4 that has an auto stop at previous fractal level and calculates the position size based on risk%, it seems good but has an error of invalid stops. it might be cause of my 5 digit broker.

thanks again

--- 帖子 #658 ---
<<<< Hi all ive just installed the system but i cant get the m2 or m3 charts online have i done something wrong with the install?? all my other charts on my platform are working properly >>>

May be you didn't switch on your expert advisor in your platform: in the settings of MT4 and on the chart also..

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Tx! - Thanks for supporting me!

--- 帖子 #660 ---
HI friend!

Tx for nice words...

I am always willing to help somebody who needs help. There are people who can not be helped. They need other kind of professional help. Among these include smilee.

Lets talk about system and trades and analyses. Analyses at first, it is a basement of a good trade!

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Europian morning today.. AUD looked perspective therefore I made some pips on it..

EUR was risky bcz strong resistance line

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hi!

You have a very good attitude about learning and trading, but I can not help you much for a start.

Im not familiar with brokers, Im choosing them regarding conditions that they offering. You are a far away from choosing a broker. Choose anyone and trade next 6 months. When you will be positive for 3 months in a row than think about broker. Until that time you will know what are a good conditions for you!

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Nice but little bit late but ok.

AU have big moves so it can be ok!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
i thought that the eur looked cleaner than the aussie for a breakout, but i was taking a risk with it being at a 72 level with resistance ahead. the trix cross at zero is what made me take it.

still made profit but wish i went long aussie.

ive made good improvements just trading 2 pairs with a 5 minute chart as confirmation.

I feel like i have been overloading myself with too many different pairs, and my track record on GBP/USD is terrible, so i gave it up.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Why do you think that late? Did not all blocks were blue before! And resistanse line was near PA.. Therefore I made my trade as I made

--- 帖子 #666 ---
But trix is to far away from zero line and PA is to far from coral.

--- 帖子 #667 ---

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Firstly, a great bow to Mihailo , fantastic thread, fantastic system, fantastic way of handling so many questions... keep it up...

And secondly, thanks to all those who have been active, unlike me,... but here I am... writing first time.. and being honest, I've not been able to try the system as I didn't have access to MT4 until yesterday... which is what brings me here...

Again, I am sorry if I am bothering someone in thread, but I have opened an account with Alpari UK, it is spread betting account and I was wondering if someone uses it over here...  just to get me started...

I am posting this request here, but by all means would like to keep it outside this thread as I respect Mihailo and others' efforts on trading based on the system..

On the ending note, I must say, the day I make enough pips and money , I'll surely try to have a sculpture in my living room from Serbai'a most expensive sculptor...

Regards to all...

a few questions:

1. what drives the colorchange of the background? all"13" indis blue? or only

13 OsMACD blue? (see picture)

2. I would like to use this backgroundcolorchange. where can I find more

information about it? maybe you can post an example here or mail it to me?

3. I still don´t know what these 4 boxes (red,yellow and green) in the

mini-HA-charts are good for. what does it mean if they are:

a) mixed colors

b) all red

c) all green?

this is not an urgent subject, but maybe you have time to answer after trading.

thanks a lot for this thread

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi Marley

1. "5 signal" is the indicator that is in first setup and it drives changing of color. It changes when trix is in conditions for trade. After that I posted "5 signalE" and its triggered by "EasyRyderSignal" changing of color is not a signal to enter. Its jut to make attention on pair witch is maybe in condition to trade!

2. To use for what?

3. Those are signals for classic thv entry, conditions on timechars as settled. All green - Long, all red - Short.

Regards

--- 帖子 #678 ---
###thanks

--- 帖子 #679 ---
1.thanks

2.i don´t know yet. but i´m thinking about something like blue  background when only longs are allowed (condition for example: price is  above moving average)- more like a visual help for me not to go short  when screen is blue

3.i have to admit i´m not familiar with thv. tested it a year ago but  didn´t like it. i think everyone has his own favorite indicators. but i  like those mini charts. are they available without these blocks?

the line looks like an moving average - true? what length?

thanks again

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Really strong movement but no signals for enter. Anybody have any ideas about this one situation?

Thanks to our buddy abc-forex we have a manual on Russian language!

Thanks buddy!

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Good work! English in Russian sounds strange but quiet understandable!

p.s. ABC зачет!

--- 帖子 #692 ---
1. Never risk more than 2 - 5% of your current (not initial)

trading capital.

2. Always use protective stops in each and every trade you execute.

3. Never average a loss as this can lead to disastrous outcomes.

4. Preferably you should always trade in the direction of the daily trend, holding a position against the daily trend should be done with caution.

5. Never enter or exit a trade without a good reason, you should have a well outlined trading plan and cross each signal out as it unfolds.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
yeah sure, come to germany. take mihailo with you and we go for some party

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hi Mihailo.

I see in its final configuration a TRIX M2.

What is the use?.

Because it puts the "flat indicator" below trix-1 and not next to the "13 Osma, Money, Fim, STCH, EasyRyder".

Хвала за све ваше подршке .

(translate.google)

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Its a trix on M2 - Renko candles with 13 pips a box!

Нема на чему, задовољство ми је!

--- 帖子 #696 ---
a nice line up of signals here.

Mainly a retracement continuation trade.

i entered after the bullish engulfing bar on the 5 min chart as the first pullback in a new established mini trend.

the m2 renko was below coral but once again the trix cross at zero combined with the confirmation of other signals made a nice trade for me.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Hi folks!

Cable gave an excellent signal without confirmation on M2.

All conditions were perfect but i wasn't near my PC... I must wait for another...

Im waiting for PA to bounce from coral on M2 and to enter short!

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hello to all!

Exactly. My analysis was the same. Going to short (SELL)..

EURUSD too.. But I think GBPUSD more perspective..

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Soo.. I got 2 losses..

--- 帖子 #700 ---
AUDUSD bought..

--- 帖子 #701 ---
I'm trying this system now for two days, and so far I have done 21 trades and only 1 trade was a loser.

So I was thinking, created someone of this system already made a fully automated EA?

--- 帖子 #702 ---
I was wondering the same !

By the way, many thanks to your system Mihailo and your help, very appreciated

Cheers from France,

hi abc. gbpusd has been in strength whole day,. dont short strong items

and aud was a risky long, but it gave some pipps i see

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I loaded the charts but the coral line is not appearing, any ideas?

--- 帖子 #707 ---
You can add it manually..

--- 帖子 #708 ---
So far no setups today right?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
No!

--- 帖子 #710 ---
There were just two beautiful setups on GBPUSD and EURUSD. Very fast ones.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
yea its been an odd day.

i think on the aussie that the market was waiting for the rate decision.

There where some scalp set up's on the continuation if you where brave (and quick). that little rally just caught me off guard and just doesn't look good on the chart, it seems like the fast action hasn't made any great signals.

waiting for that really good setup especially on the trixes have helped me  achieve 7 wins in a row now.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Very strange i did not get all blues like you.

The setting for renko is 10box right?

--- 帖子 #713 ---
its all set to the lovely 13

--- 帖子 #714 ---
all markets are ranging, all the dollar pairs at this moment.

this is the field of a trained scalper/artist. thats the only way to profit. lower PTS and get in at good levels

at the moment AUDUSD will be very well supported provided euro can get their act together .if more risk , AUD rates will be further cut causing long term decline to 0.90 regions

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Main chart 5 minichart 13!

--- 帖子 #716 ---
That's right. It was 13.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Just to clarify,

1. I open two M1 charts

2. Insert the renkolive chart EA and set 13 and 2min

3. Insert into the other M1 chart another renkolive chart EA and set 13 and 3min

4. Open offline chart and open both the M2 and M3

5. Insert templates into both of them.

Where should I set the renko box of main chart? I think am missing alot cos my trix is flat and the coral line is not appearing..

My broker uses suffix like eurusd_fx so I can't use the profiles and history...

--- 帖子 #718 ---
@juzgood1978

I used attached profile (Renko thv 5) instead of manually adding indicators. Try this way.

After that, I removed bottom minicharts due to problems with their proper display.

Best regards to all,

Milosz

You done a great work, seems that you are getting as good at this as good you are in sculpture.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
I think your entry is too late. The thrix already changing directions.

My challenge is also signals passing too fast, is there anyway I can catchup the signals without looking at the screen all the time?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
It was not signal! Mini chart was in sell.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
I think the problem with EasyRider. Look at other picture with situation without ER signal. And, yes TRIX getting change BUT when i getted in the TRIX was really good.

Hi Mihailo

When all aligns, the screen will flash red or green to alert us to enter trade.

Would that also mean an EA is possible?

I do not know how to set stop loss? 25 pips or more?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Means?

--- 帖子 #735 ---
this system based on some indicators that must show the same direction. easyrider is good ofc but look Mihailos attached pics and y will see how a good entry must look like.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
hi mihailo. imo he was too late entry, there was 1  long setup for 10-20 pips earlier he misses

--- 帖子 #737 ---
The easyryder is not very good. I just got a a buy signal for eurusd but the price is not out of the clouds and the trix not cross yet.

Fornthe EJ trade, the trix is already turning red...and the cross of the trix is too far from the place you enter.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
This two entries are not valid because:

1. PA on M2 chart was under the coral line, fast trix was too far from the cross and the zero line, almost in sell zone.

2. Same thing about trix!

Did you  actually read the rules? All colors must be the same...

Please spend sometime to read the manual please.

Thanks for this great system, just like to know will the Since this system reward Is lesser than risk, will this be an issue in the long run? I understand from some experts that a trading system should have at least a 2:1 reward risk ratio. Please enlighten me.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
My apologies missed the markings earlier. I shall keep quiet in future and leave it to you my trading master to answer. Once again so sorry, was trying to help only  no offense.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Yes Easy gave a signal, but you must consider all parameters of the trade.

Trix is very important indicator that you must respect!

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Cool!

Hi Mihailo

By the way...

Thanks for this great system, just like to know will the Since this system reward Is lesser than risk, will this be an issue in the long run? I understand from some experts that a trading system should have at least a 2:1 reward risk ratio. Please enlighten me.. Thanks in advance

Hi Mihailo,

Great job, your indicator is fantastic! And thanks to share your work with us.

Regards.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
I'm confused

This is your picture http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=322817&page=5

And Trix is in the Bay zona and you're done sell

The same situation as with me, I do not understand....

--- 帖子 #760 ---
This is also your files http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=322817&page=5

Why are you here enter sell?

Nothing is valid,

Coral is under trend

Trix is blue

but you did sell, why?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #761 ---
This is picture from FelixFX http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=322817&page=6

Every time he enter into trade, Trix was in the counter direction (buy  or sell zone), same like me, but Felix is enter into trade...

Signs that he looked at Trix never have entered into trade...

--- 帖子 #762 ---
I hope you got this trade guys )))

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Here's another one of your pictures http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=322817&page=7

Why you enter buy when the trix was the sell zone?

According to your rules, not entering into a trade if the trix in buy or sell zone

And yet all you are doing is against the your rules!

As I did and missed the trade, it's against your rules!

In your rules you must respect Trix, but you dont him respect! Why?

--- 帖子 #764 ---
This is a valid trade!

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Depends on your MM.

This system gives you signal for enter, you decide when to exit!

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Seems that I was lucky!

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I think you have been lucky in 40% of cases, and the rest of the trade is a loss!

Where is your stop loss?

You put here only trade in positive, and where are trade in negative? Why dont put him here?

Put here some statement, not just these pictures ....

To see some numbers, not pictures!

To see in black and white what is your strategy!

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Sorry to other guys but its much easier for me to answer this on my own mother language.

Druže činjenica je da u tim trgovinama nisam ulazio baš po pravilima. Stvar je u tome da ja već više od godinu dana trgujem ovim sistemom i jednostavno mi se već stvorio osećaj za kretanje valute. Naravno da nisam uvek u pravu ali eto u ovim slučajevima je to prošlo. Takođe ćeš ovde videti i trgovine koje su baš po pravilima. Ukoliko želiš da malo više popričamo o ovome svemu pošalji mi poruku i ja ću ti poslati moj telefon i skajp adresu!

Ukoliko ti je namera da mene ili nekoga ovde na forumu ubediš da moj sistem ne funkcioniše i da ja postujem neistinite podatke na pogrešnu stranu si krenuo.

Mihailo you write and showing one and doing other!

I found you on another forum, your statement. http://www.elitesecurity.org/t317722...ovina-Valutama

You dont put stop loss

Too much risk!

Without sl your sistem maybe work one or two month, but the loss is for sure!!!

With sl of 25 pips is impossible to be in the positive! You know this!

In both cases, loss is sure!

This sistem is same like your http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...7271&page=1538

Gooooood luck with your sistem!

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Hi Abc!

Yes it looks like good signal on your platform....

Hope that you get out positive but...

On my screen it looks very different!?!?!?!

Coral is different, signals....

Hmmmmmmmmm  Brokers are sending different picture. As I see difference in two hours between your broker and mine.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
1. Yes that is my statement! That is from the period when I used pure Thv system.

3. Sometimes yes sometimes no, so ? Its my MM!

2. It works for me much more than 2 months. And people will see if it works for them. Im not selling anything? Everyone is free to try!

3. Where did I mentioned that sl have to be 25? I recommended 35-50 in manual. As I said my system gives the signal for enter, exit is with your MM.

4. Yes my system is based on Thv system as I said on the first post! I dont see what is wrong?

Thanks for your good wishes!

--- 帖子 #773 ---
I feel that I have to translate this reply:

Buddy, its true that I didnt enter all trades by the rules. Im trading my system more then one year and simply, I have develop some kind of sentiency for the movement. Of course that Im wrong sometimes but in those cases it came up on good. Also you will find on this thread trades that I posted witch are by the rules. If you want to discuss with me more on this topic, feel free to send me a PM  and I will send you my skype address or my phone number.

If your attentions are to convince me or someone else here on this thread, that my system doesnt work or that Im fake, you are going in the wrong direction!

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Congratulations on outstanding performance Mihailo!

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Tx!

--- 帖子 #777 ---
If this candle closes down, this looks to be a pretty good sell signal.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
As I undestand the difference between MT4-server time is not reason..

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Mihailo, how you think: what better for trading, what more profitable - renko system based THV or classic THV?

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Your pic not as mine.. See below.. You have strange candles on the chart..

In this situation Trix is not good.. We have flat now. I'm waiting the movement

--- 帖子 #781 ---
The candles are renko blocks, I just have the HA turned off.  You are right the trix is flat and we are waiting.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Let's see how it goes

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Morning to everyone!

I like Thv classic very much.

My basic idea was to clear false signals from Thv with my system.

Im more comfortable with renko

--- 帖子 #784 ---
EUR buy signal but risky bcz strong support 1.3426 is near..

--- 帖子 #785 ---
So.. THV classic gives more trades and more false trades for you?

--- 帖子 #786 ---
thv classic is trading in M1 TF.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Well... as felix says Thv is based on m1 and confirmation on m5. So if you compare M5 and renko you will find that renko have clearer  signal than m5.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
We have ranging market today coused with big news... Will stay out untill

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Which news? (as I see: the news will be later.. in three hours)

I got SL = -20 on EURUSD BUY

What do you think about EURJPY now?

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Very interesting for me to know which system more profitable.. I didn't trade by THV classic therefore I asked such question.. Thank you and Thank Felix!

--- 帖子 #791 ---
risky trade but i had my reasons thanks to M5 and m1.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Good enter!

2 candles late!

--- 帖子 #793 ---
euro will break this week, thats news enough? I changed all my euros in food  may I buy some rubel?

--- 帖子 #794 ---
you may do it in january

--- 帖子 #795 ---
EU +13

Maybe I get out to early but .... Positive is positive!

--- 帖子 #796 ---
MFI was blue 2 candles ago and there was support line near..

... but I took +18 pips on EURJPY  and +9 on EURUSD

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Excellent!

Check if your mfi is on 13 it should be on 8

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Yes, I have 8 in MFI.. Broker with 4 digits

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Look at mine!

Perfect enter!

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Thank you..

Very strange.. After click OK in properties of MFI indicator I got this pic.. New red block is apears.. Hmm..

--- 帖子 #801 ---
There is something with RENKO charts.

I have experience that every day when I start my Mt4 platform, I restart it in 2 minutes.

I think that renko blocks have to apply a history that happens during the night. Every time for a while, every 20 or 30 minutes I apply template over again.

You all have to know that this version of Renko is not comercial version!

--- 帖子 #802 ---
thanks ; just start to try..I am not so experienced with chart organisation. Perhaps I could not install correct. On my chart I have a yellow wave on the left with numerical lines on it which effdects on my view. On the right side close to the fibs S/R lines I have a diagonal market line which is unreadable..I make possible some installation folds. Can anyone help me out, so please..thanks in advance

EDIT:   OKKK....IT WAS THE PROBLEM OF THE FONT...SO NOT NEED TO HELP OUT ANYMORE..THANKS FOR THIS SYSTEM, LATER ON I WILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR SURE

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Why my EUR M2 doesn't draw the LWMA 55?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Not enough history.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
I downloaded the history from page 1 and followed the instrucctions perfectly

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Here is green version of indicators!

--- 帖子 #807 ---
After I open the metadtrader (restart), my minicharts are away. and if I use the template again, all my time settings dissapare so I have to reload them again. Do I have to erase the minicharts from using? Because each time after restart the minicharts are away.. In a little earlier post I read that the chart needs to be templated again after restart the metatrader or after 40-50 minutes..Does it true so? My last question for now is , I get signals ..Do I have to check manuel for other entry points or add new positions or the signals give the best possible setup so most of time following the signal is good as well in much situations to entry. I readed the rules for entry points, but seems the signals are also comfortable possible entries..I not make backtest of my entries but I check this system since 3-4 hours and seems very nice...

Thanks for sharing..at least something very good to work on...

--- 帖子 #808 ---
What time settings?

Post a picture

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Time settings of the market and the pivots..after I restart the metadtrader, my minicharts are gone and if I use refresh with template the this time settings needs to arranged again..

--- 帖子 #810 ---
When you set everything, just save again template with your settings!

--- 帖子 #811 ---
How can I increase the history?

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Thanks, Mihailo.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Which of the green indicators is the blue cloud?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Thanks a million Mihailo, for this wonderful system.

Just started reading the thread 30 mins ago, downloaded everything from post 1, read the manual and never had a problem, everything running super smooth. I am just wondering why there is so many question on setting up this or that .. I mean .. its all explained clearly. First half pages of this thread is more like a MT4 guidebook than a trading system. And I am surprised to see the kind of patient Mihailo have and answering every question .. real Gentleman.

Anyway, Thanks again Mihailo. I am yet to try this system but will finish reading the thread first. May be start trading it from Friday London. Will post my trades for sure. Catch you guys later. Green pips to all.

Good morning to all !

Does anybody catch this movement as me?

--- 帖子 #818 ---
the movement of the PA is exact the same...here I post mine as well there are some differnt arrows on the trix..Maybe master can help out..

--- 帖子 #819 ---
yes

and it keeps goin!!

i took 13 pips cause i thought it bottomed out!

--- 帖子 #820 ---
I have some problems perhaps on the PA. The Pa is not adding on Euro,Jpy   candles as fast as Gbp/Usd..seems like it has another Time Frame a new candle appears in 15 minutes (  here the chart..Mihailo good morning first of all)very nice system but some install problems occur I think..can you help me out..thanks..

--- 帖子 #821 ---
I found my answer mysel  ) sorry

'Renko charts have a pre-determined "Brick Size" that is used to determine when new bricks are added to the chart. If prices move more than the Brick Size above the top (or below the bottom) of the last brick on the chart, a new brick is added in the next chart column'

I need to spend more time on reading , however now I will check all posts up to date..again sorry

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Excellent catch!

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Mihailo!

Congratulations to the trading system! It can be a lot of work. I can only encourage still more perfect that shaped this strategy.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
My first trade with Renko+Mihailo   20 pips.

It didn't meet all the conditions but I followed my instinct. The PA just passed an important level 1.3400, Fib retrenchment level 23.6 was also close. My target was DPV 1.3363 but got out with 20 pips because of the coming USD trade balance news. Anyway I am more than happy, 20 pips is all I need.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Right,

Hello to all again and upfront I'd like to say that please ignore the post instead of getting annoyed...

But as we all know, there are people who've been follwing this thread from beginning ( though I don't write much ) and there would always be new people joining...

Though most would make an effort to read through all the posts, people are still going to be able to get the learning experience.

Would it be possible for someone, who has really understood the system installation and use inside out, to write an indepth manual ?? Just so that it clears out all the confusion about candles not loading in offline charts ( in my case, I have left PC on all night, but no candles appeared though I have downloaded history from 1st Post ) , or indicators not showing, time zone being wrong etc..

This is just a request, and I am happy to help by writing it all up, talking to someone over the phone or skype and making it work for all those who need this.

Not sure what all abuse I might get, but I felt I had to say it, as much as all the successful traders here who are making pips, there are aspirants who want to work hard but who also need time and help to pace their game, may be this documentation would help...

Regards to all..

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Its ok but there is instalation manual with pictures on the post 201 and link from the post 1.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Yes I am aware of this Sir, but anyway... I'll try installing it all again and see if I can manage to make it work.

Thanks...

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Anyway post a picture and I will help

--- 帖子 #829 ---

Hi,

This is my first post ever, and i had the need to write a few lines and Thank You Mr Mihailo for the GREAT system that you have.

I had no issues installing, and i've been using the system for a week now.

I have no words, its really great. Today only my pip count is +48 and that because of you.

Really Thanks from Portugal.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Working day:

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Just curious to know what profile have you used ??

Is it

5!!

THV 5! or

THV13

I am being honest, I am still confused about a few things...

--- 帖子 #833 ---
And I leave I'm too tired

--- 帖子 #834 ---
I use the M3 (5).

But if I can be in favor of M2 (13) much better

(Google Translate)

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Thanks a lot my friend...

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Hi Mihailo,

I am a new member to the FF. But I have read your Thread for some days and I think the green version also have some updates.

The file includes the followings:- Would you mind to help me to know them more before my real trade? Great Thanks.

3 M

3 M v.1.1

3 spr sl

5 SignalE, Generate

13 Complex

13 EasyRyderSignals

13 FIM

13 MoneyFlowIndex

13 OsMA i MACD

13 Stochastic

Flat indictor

1) 13 Complex, Flat indictor are for infomation only?

2) The pervious 13 T3, 13 CCI is going to be obsolate?

3) There are new version for the 3 M, but I cannot find it at the templates and setups, does it need for for the calling from other trading indictors?

4) Does the FIM stand for "Full Indictor Movement" Indicator, or else can you tell?

5) The Entry signal is all 13s indictors in the same trend and now it is present by EasyRyderSignal. On the other hand, the SignalE also generate its TP,SL Signal independantly. Can we trade it as two systems or filter of others? How is the best?

6) If my computer run slow, can I drop the M1 chart for Renko box 13, M2 chart and the  indictors of Stratman_MiniChart for M2. They do not influent any trading signal. Right?

--- 帖子 #837 ---
nice work mate, i had the same as you.

this week there werent many signals but 9 out of 12 where winners

+50 or so pips

Just a question to put out there.

Are most people on this forum still trading demo?

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Nothing special changed....

Im always searching for new setup that works better than last. You can choose on your free will combination of the indicators. All of them are good tools.

1. They are only one info more.

3. Its only for EasyRyderSignals v1.2.

4. Force and Momentum indicators 2 in 1.

5.  You can set up EasyRyder witch of the indicators you want to use for the signal. SignalE doesnt generate anything it change color of the chart as signal to analyses trade in color direction. Sl and TP are generated with 3 spr sl And use 3 ATR to generate.

6. You can set your screen as you want, consider M2 as one of the most important tool in this system.

Green pips!

where is the settings to avoid the alarm of NEWS AND MARKET OPEN-CLOSE???????(From default the tmp 5 alarm the market !

Set countdown to false on every chart that contains indicator "Market Hours"

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Thanks for your detail explanation.

For what I understood, the 13s was working accroding to the M3 (Box 5). But you said M2 was the most important. Why didn't we take the 13s in the M2 chart? (I knew we had to leave M2 empty and trading at the M3)

If  3 spr sl was working at 3 ATR, so it would generate against signal before the 13s to reverse the new trend. Accroding to your experience, how did we confirm the signal and go to trade on it? Did we need to wait until they were at the same trend?

In summary, could I say we look at the M2 for long term, 13s for middle term and the 3 spr sl for short term of trading?

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Hi Mihailo

I have been reading the whole thread here and I am liking this system, only problem for me is that I work so I have no time to trade it which is a shame. Is it possible you can send me all the indicators as MQ4 so I can contract a programmer to create an ea for this.

Also I have been looking through this thread for EasyRyderSignals v1.2 but can only find V1.1.

Carl

--- 帖子 #843 ---
You didnt understand me and im sorry for my English, 3 spr sl - upper left corner, generating spread and recommended SL and TP using ATR.

SignalE coloring the background of the chart and makes popups with info about signal. Its only a signal to pay attention on all indicators and consider entering the trade.

Candles on m2 we use just to determinate a trend, below coral and going down - sell and above coral and rising - buy.

I found also the 5 SignalE in the "green indictator.rar" was calling both the 13 EasyRyderSignals v1.2 and 13 EasyRyderSignals v1.3.  Was there any new update (new v1.3) ?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Morning all,

I checked the thread but could not find the different between easyrider 1.1 and 1.2, perhaps I missed the page.. Can I use it with profile Renko THV 5..In the version 1.1. I made Coral_Filter false..İn version 1.2 there are two Coral filters, which one exact match it?..What are the other differents. Sorry but I miss maybe the explanation page somehow..(

Good morning & good profit on AUDUSD = +12 pips.

The signals were on others pairs also, but I missed them..

--- 帖子 #849 ---
nice one.

the aussie was 5 pips from a perfect buy before it fell out of bed.

I made 13 pips on the aud drop.

A total of 25 pips today selling eur/usd and aud/usd

i do think that i have been a bit over cautious taking profit which has resulted in less pips, but have also been solid with taking trades out in profit and not a loss.

these signals are amazing for scalps!!!

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Sorry, if it was answered before, but isn't this just box charts in diagonal? Are renko more useful?

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Did you trade early? when divergence-arrow is appear?

Ohh.. I missed this signal..

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Well,

I was in some problems out of forex and I didnt realise that I made some mistakes.

EasyRyder1.3 is only for 5 SignalE  but I didnt post it.

Sorry folks !

EasyRyder 1.2 have some improvements as Coral M2 witch declares if PA on M2 is above or below coral.

Hello Mihailo,

so I understud

Version 1.1 was for Renko THV5

Version 1.2 was for Renko THV13 and/or maybe together to use with THV5

Version 1.3 is again only for Renko THV5

and the Signal5.exe is the same like the page 1 packet5.rar

On the page 1 we have only the setup for Renko THV5, Renko THV13 is inside written in the posts

I am using the profile Renko THV5...so I need to understand which indicator is best setup now for Renko THV5 or do I have to better switch to Renko THV13.

Sorry but after versions the 1.page differ and usual I have very good signals together with Easyrider 1.1 , version 1.3 gives earlier signals but also not so much accurate like 1.1....or do you have another result

Sorry but I have this stupid questions and need help to get out...

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Uffff,

Version 1.1 is the first

Version 1.2 is the new one.... little bit better

version 1.3 is not for chart!

5 SignalE - better signal tool based on version 1.3

Renko Thv 5 - Short term trading

Renko thv 13 long term trading.

Use indicators for both systems.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
I got it better  хвала

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Молим и други пут!

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Thank you for the indicator.

Please could you tell me the following

When you trade this system do you trade as soon as there is a signal or do you wait for the current candle to close to confirm the signal is valid.

How close in pips should the HA be to coral and the cloud indicator and also how close should the trix cross be, to the zero line before its a perfect signal.

Thanks Carl

y marked 3 setups. Only the second is a good one cause at first and third one the coral was too far away. look images posted by mihailo or abc for good trading conditions

--- 帖子 #895 ---
so far this week ive made 54pips yay.

Ive made some good trades and only one looser.

im still using easyryder 1.1 with a 5 min and 1 min chart for confirmation and it seems to be going alright so far.

Is anyone doing any thing much differant and getting any better results or worse results?

--- 帖子 #896 ---
The second also not good because TRIX too far from zero...

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Perhaps you trade not so much on it. I have much more pips done in +. But also much more lose trades. But in average it was very good.

On my next post I have questions for the new version to Master Mihailo, or others who can help me.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Dear Mihailo Good Morning,

I used since yesterday on 2 computers the new version. I have on both computer other images of the templates. However I am not sure also that on both computers the new version is correct installed. Its differ on images from the first installad version which was refreshing and historic data was good. I am using your siysem unique on a metatrader amd my real account is on another metadtrader

Before start I want to say how I did install it. I replaced the expert changed automatic with the new one, I erased all old profiles and put the new ones, I replaced all new indicators when it asks me to change I changed them.I erased all templates and put the new ones. I erased all historic and put the new ones.

So after I open the mt4 it automatic detected the profile 'Renko thv 5' with 5 pairs

So I have now this happen.

On all charts the the easyrider 1.2 has all blue or red. Or in example Usd Cad has to give me a signal but it does not give a voice signal

On my GbP/Usd,M2 offline chart what we are not using for trade there is an Easyrider installed in other M2 offlines ı have trix installed in different appearings,

The easrider seems to have a problem to refresh update or reading.

On my other computer I have more problems. On that one my trix line on 2 pairs are straight and not swinging. The coral comes straight from the upper side to the middle directional and turns The easriders are only red on all pairs..

So it seems I have a problem on refreshing and historical or templates.

Despite ALL OF THIS I HAVE 4 SIGNALS FROM THE MORNING IN ONE HOUR AND ALL 4 ARE WINNERS IN 30 MINUTES 50 PIP

I am not sure but maybe I have to uninstall the metadtrader and install it back.. I love the mechanism of this system but installation is quit not easy at least not for me..But I am confident this system has the power to make nice pips

--- 帖子 #899 ---
In my new settings you will find that price tags are appears on mani chart!

If price tags are colored "Aqua" - Long or "Magenta" - Short that means that its generated with EasyRydersSignals without M2 Coral included.

If price tags are "Red" - Short or "Lime" - Long that means that they are generated by EasyRydersSygnal with M2 Coral included.

) ok...The easrider issue is complete ..So I need only the historical data ..my testing starts, so far on 3 hours 113 pips 12 win 2 loose..On the previous version I had on last days bad performance but the lack with this verison could be over will see and test the continues onto next days. I will try to test two weeks which gives me an average opinion, I hope to see also bad trades and days sometimes to determinate a clearer performance.. Great work Mihailo this is a real christmas gift thank you...

Dear Mihalio ,

Hello Mihailo,

I would like to test your system but cant get it running.

I've followed the instructions in the first post and when I want to start it it stays that way:
http://shrani.si/t/1l/L6/1TpNeOVG/1.jpg

Otherwise, I use micro acounts, for example EUR/USDm:
http://shrani.si/t/14/K2/1iEhY0zb/2.jpg

My broker is FinFx.

I've tried to open an offline chart manually -> File-Open offline-EUR/USDm,M3.

In this case, it openes the chart, but as a normal MT4 profile, no Renko.

I've tried 5!v1 and Renko thv 1, but none worked.

If I try to open one of your templates, MT4 freezes.

Hope I'll get this running, I really like the setup.

Little "m" in the name of the chart is problem....

You have to go step by step and its very hard if you never use my system.

I will do that for you this evening and you will have everything by tomorrow.

I will post it as I finish!

I appreciate your effort.

Hello to everyone!

Here are the profiles and the templates for the people who have a micro accounts.

Everything else you can download from the post nr. 1 but use this profiles and this templates.

Gooooood luck to all!

--- 帖子 #909 ---
hm... strange things are going on.

When I install those templates & profiles and choose one of the profiles MT4 freezes.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Sir plz put this info @ page 1 also so can new commerce can get it easily

--- 帖子 #911 ---
It is there alleady.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Hi!

Check if your Mt4 is updated for last version 409.

It works on my FinFX demo!

--- 帖子 #913 ---
I've deleted almost all files from the profiles folder, because I've thought the computer is somehow overloaded.

After that it worked, but still it is very slow, when I open a new chart - takes 10 sec. to load it.

So now it is working and it looks like that:

http://shrani.si/t/3u/Uj/bT1TsAn/1.jpg

Is everything on it? Template is 5!.

Its a bit crowded, probably because I use a 15 inch laptop. I guess I can resize stuff to make it fit better (news, market hours...).

Is there anything I can delete from it to make it work better? Maybe the minichart?

If I understand this corectly I need only M3 offline charts to trade? So I can delete then all of the others?

But the problem is, that if I go to "open offline" there are not M3 charts for all pairs availiable

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Hi Mihailo,

Now, on that new templates (charts) we have additional elements, such as price tags.

How it is possible to disable them (I mean, price tags)?

I closely watch the price action, and in first minutes during the move, those price tags covers active candle (in same cases), and this is disturbing. Sometimes I can delete it, but sometimes can't.

So, I wish to disable that price tags.

Thanks a lot.

Пуно хвала царе на труду! Свака част!

--- 帖子 #915 ---
As I see you are very newbee in trading on forex also with renko candles.

I wrote on the first post that you can not delete any chart, and I wrote rules of trading.

Please spend some times learning and reading.

I will help you as much I can when you get some basic knowledge about forex.

Also if your laptop have no good performances you can not run this system on it.

And for a start, change your broker if you dont have a real account there. Something wrong with their platform. I have Intel Quad core 4 x 2.3 G and it slows my PC a little bit.

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #916 ---
I've updated with those files but I'm stuck at "Waiting for update" in all the charts. Back to "old" files!

--- 帖子 #917 ---
GBPUSD buy closed +22 pips..

---

EURUSD buy closed +16 pips..

---

AUDUSD buy closed +7..

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Do you have a micro accound where chart is signed as EURUSDm?

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Excellent!

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Tnx for your help Mihailo, but I cant get it running.

I've tried also a new broker, made a fresh install but its just waiting to update and my CPU is running like hell. So I asume a to week CPU is the problem.

Yes, Im a noob, but I've been through the babypips school so the basics are known to me. Now I'm trying out systems to see what fits me and I yours was looking very interesting.

Anyway, seems like I have to move on but I'll return when I get a new computer

--- 帖子 #921 ---
If you are using another broker download from the post 1 not setup for a micro account!

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Yeah, I did that... still nothing.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Hi, great system !

Why easyRiderSignal is repainting indicator ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Only during the candle.

That is normal, all indicators changing during the candle.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Of course but he is repaint on 2nd and 3 candle. i try to catch this for post screen.

Maybe because I use it on M1 ?

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hi Mihailo,

Congrats for such system!

Is it possible to get the previous Paket 5 with old indicators and profiles (preceding to that new, which is now active in first post).

These new ones seems a little bit weird to me (on my MT4). I am getting blue and red screen with buy and sell alerts, but there are no all blue and red "bricks" settings at that moment. So, I am not sure what is logic behind buy and sell signals. That wasn't situation with previous profiles / templates.

Thanks a lot.

Пуно хвала унапред.

Поздрав из Хрватске.

P.S. No, I have to edit my post, because I found old profiles and indicators. I have installed them on another MT4, so I just did copy-paste. Everything works very well.

Anyway, thanks.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
every time I try to load the profile, the mt4 will just crash and close.. anyone know the reason to fix it?

--- 帖子 #928 ---
If you use it on m1 it will not work properly

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Update your mt4 to version 409

--- 帖子 #930 ---
Жив био јуначе!

Nobody ask so I didnt explain!

In new settings you are receiving signals on 2 conditions.

1. When EasyRyderSignals send signal for BUY/SELL without Coral on M2 included, than your screen goes little bit lighter blue or red, and you will find that price tags are appears on mani chart colored "Aqua" - Long or "Magenta" - Short

2. When EasyRyderSignal send signal for BUY/SELL with Coral on M2 included, than your screen goes darker blue or red, and you will find that price tags are appears on mani chart colored "Lime" - Long or "Red" - Short

Have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #931 ---
have good weekend all

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Hi all,

thank you, Mihailo, for sharing your system.

I do not know what is the wrong when I install gold template. It work perfectly on my fxcm demo account, but it does not work on real account(fxcm), I do not know what the problem is? can you help, thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Поздрав царе - Hi Mihalo,

Yes, I understand that.

But, problem is that I have no agreement regarding blue and light "bricks" at indicators below the chart. Also, there is no agreement on EasyRyderSignals. There is no agreement at all  - on any place.

But, despite of that, I have sound alert, and blue or red colored chart.

But, don't bother with that, because I found my old indicators and settings, and now everything is well.

Problem might appears because I make some changes on your indicators and templates, to suite my style better. So, when I install new version, maybe there was something messed up (because of my earlier settings). So, you don't have to care about that

Have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Cool!

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Mihailo thank you for this great system. I would like to ask you , how is the indicator called that shows the green daily candle on the right of the chart?

Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
thank you, Mihailo, I solved the problem. I used RenkoLiveChart-Not EA indicator instead of RenkoLiveChart_v3.3.ex4 EA.

thank you.

--- 帖子 #937 ---
It is a part of the TzPivotsDaily.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Greetings to all, and first thanks to Mihailo & all who helped developed this system.

I started studying the C4/Nitro system with good demo results, and then the THV system because I wanted a more current community of traders to see results with. I also think the renko system of filtering PA makes sense, so this THV 5 sysstem is ideal, I think.

I am trying to simplify my charts to get the essence of good signals/analysis, because I find if I have too much info, I get too excited/emotional and chase PA around like an idiot, buying when I should be selling, etc. If there's too much alerts and flashies, I don't take the time to really consider what I'm doing, which is not usually good.

To this end, I have gone "back to basics" and started to build a template that has the best of the signal info for me that I can make calm decisions with.

I have posted a chart from some GU trades on Friday, the second long I went in early on the trix divergence signal, and should have stayed in much longer, but was using caveman at a very conservative setting, so the retracement protected my profits, but took me out before the real pipfeast.

Anyhow, here is my question: I am using THV V4 trix, and I want to have the minicharts on the side, but the background box is blocking them, so I have to set them manually to be drawn as background, to not cover up the minicharts.  The first shows what it does automatically, and the second chart shows what I want it to do (after I go into objects and set each background box manually to be background). The third chart is the trades from Friday.

Thanks for any help with sorting this out.  I need the smaller version to fit on my screen with all the pairs I trade, and when I expand the screen, it has the full info.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Hi!

All indicators that you can find on the first post are adapted for using on renko.

I cant help you with them to use it on classic candles. Go to Thv thread and download them in original version to use them on classic candles.

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #940 ---
may i ask, what is the difference between the free profiles which are in the rar?

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Thanks for replying, and thanks again for your work!

sorry if I wasn't clear, these candles are renko, and the basic set up is the same (using the 1m charts and the renko EAs for 5-pip blocks on M3 and 13-pip block on M2)

I just needed to organize the visual differently for my eyes not to get bigger than my stomach! My computer is also struggling, so I'm trying to get the most info with the fewest indis, if possible...

I also asked for help on the original THV thread, and there is a different version of the THV V4 Trix indi, 1.2, that allows the box & logo to be moved, thanks to ricmi.

We'll see how it works on Monday! just taking advantage of the weekend to organize my setup better.

cheers!

--- 帖子 #942 ---
here's the revised setup, hope to post good trades next week

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hi,

Nice tpl. Can you post it please ?

Thank you !

--- 帖子 #944 ---
since this is Mihailo's thread, and since I am new on FF and trying to figure things out, I will ask his esteemed permission before posting the tpl.

I'm happy to do so, as it's free info for all here, but, as Mihailo mentioned in an earlier post, there are a lot of other charts involved behind this one, and I don't want to contribute to any confusion since a lot of work has gone into the original templates & profiles.

As long as you have everything else set up according to the system (2x M1 charts with Renko EA for 5 & 13, offline M2 and offline M3 for trading, and all required indis loaded, then this template should work for M3.

I wait for Mihailo's opinion (maybe I'm super wrong about something?)

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Seams that we dont understand each other...

This cant be renko!

Also it looks like very good setup!

EDIT: And your broker is a thief ! Very big spread for this pair!

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Of course that you can post it!

Welcome to do that!

This thread is about making money if someone can do it better with your template Im happy that this will be here!

Dont forget to post indicators for it.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Just different order of tools....

Choose one that suites you best!

--- 帖子 #948 ---
Hi & thanks for responding...

I was using the HA indicator as per the system, and that's what it looked like, and I also thought it didn't look like usual renko, is HA right?

I made a version with no HA, and it looks more like renko... (see attached)

This was from end of day on Friday, so usually the platform (MB Trading ECN) has spreads between 0-2 pips; i think that indi got stuck at market close ( I hope!)

thanks for your generous OK, and will post the template and indis carefully.

cheers

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Hmmmm something wrong with renko bars...

Do you use RenkoLiveChart from first post?

Those wicks can not be so long and there is no chance that block jumps over another.....

Can you please post a picture checked as "Active workspace"

--- 帖子 #950 ---
Yes, I'm using Renko Live 3.3 from the first post, although not getting info from  brokers now.

here's the workspace pic, any help is appreciated!

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Everything looks ok...

Lets just wait for the market to be open. Maybe everything will be ok.

--- 帖子 #952 ---
So far, this seems OK, but now that the markets are open, the new price flags are covering up the current PA, and I would like to move them, shrink them or turn the m off? is it possible? sorry if this has been dealt with already....

here is updated screenshot (spread still sucks... but it's not a usual trading time for me)

cheers!

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Hi - thanks to Mihailo for guidance and hopefully this helps!

As requested, here is the template (it's work in progress) and the indis that are essential or not part of the first package. I have simply combined some elements from the THV 4 system to suit my visual taste.

I think it's worth the effort to understand all the pieces of a system, and to make one's own adjustments; we'll see how this helps in trading!

I can only post 7 files at a time, and most of these indis are in the main package from the first post. I'm also trying CaveManager 1.3 to manage the trade once I get in, but I am still working with the settings (it took me out too early on the GU long trade on Friday because I had it set to protect my profits after 10 pips; the retrace took care of that :-{, but I missed the big move that came after.

the full list:

Main:

-coral

-ichimoku

-TzPivotsDv 3.5

-5signalE

-THV4 Info panel

-Stratman Minichart

Window 1:

-THV4 Triv V1.2

Window 2:

-13 Easy Rider Signals1.2 v1.2

Window 3:

-13 Stochastic

Window 4:

-13 FIM

Window 5;

-THV4 TRIX MTF

cheers & regards

--- 帖子 #954 ---
basically following rules, easy ryder, under cloud & coral, watching trix for divergence, careful around pivots, and using caveman to keep me cautious; as i'm sortascalping, i take the first 5 pips i get with half the trade, then let ride for another 10 pips if possible. once i have 10 pips, i keep it (or caveman keeps it for me) and if the trend holds, i'll re-enter. just doing some late-night testing before the london-new york overlap, to see if this setup keeps me from being a spaz. not 100% sure on that yet, but thanks again to to mihailo and the thv crew for a good set of tools.

cheers.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
and a similar setup for gu

--- 帖子 #956 ---
just looked like the EU short party would keep on, a little retracement never hurt, but this was a spaz trade.  i think, based on m5 & m15 PA & trix, that there is a little more left in this down trend, but am OK with SL 20 to be wrong...

Morning All,

so I understand on trading for two days with the last version of our master Mihailo, I have got many signals. To try to trade all signals has sometimes very good potential but also has in a row losts..On average based on all signals there comes not much different.This is a apart style of the rules mentioned, Mihailo not mention to trade all signals, however I tried to see all signals potential. On apart of this The system uses much CPU Ram evt. and if I have it open I never close it) Cause I have also my other MT4 open and have other programs open cause of business. At home my pc is high end computer, so no problem. This week I will try to not take all signals and focus a little bit more to see what is the PA doing and where it is (thanks the chart is clear to understand that). I was watching out that in many signals I take get some pips but before its reach the TP it changed its side to move earlier as estimated and that makes some  losts. So some tweeks on deciding to trade needs to experienced as well as the exit before hit on a lost. Sometimes I have also the feeling that I am some seconds late to enter the trade, however this is the fact of all signal based systems as its produce a signal on clear moves and we need to be very fast to decide to trade..So this week I will focus more on manual decides based on the signal and check the chart if I can see the potential of the PA if we are ranging trending R/S lines weeker stronger overbought/oversold and such other points. This will definitly improving the accuraty of my trades.. Nice weekend to all..

remember hes has been a very volatile market many trade never did reach they target due too the euro hard too predict when the market settle i am sure the system will work very good.

I bailed early on the EU spaz trade, as it was clear after 13 pips the train was going in the other direction, waited for some confirmation and went long, scored 10-ish.

Took a break, and not convinced of what 's going on now, but getting EU buy signals and PA has cleared cloud and coral, will see if M2 breaks coral and if PA stays above FPV for maybe one box.  any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Hi Mihailo,

Where we can set parameter for Market hours? Which indicators is that (in the list). On your previous set of indicators (and profiles) there was clearly visible indicator named "Market hours". Now, I don't see it anymore (please, see attach), so I suppose you merge it with some other one. But, can't find which one.

I have to set right time on it.

Thanks a lot.

I use igmarkets to place my orders as they have 0.8 pips spread on AUD and EUR

well i got in the euro at 1.3017 as is pushed through the 610 EMA on the 5 minute chart on the 5th attempt. I got 15 pips.

Aud was +10 got in at 99.55.

As usual i look at the 1 minute chart to much after i enter and i probably got out to early, but any way my win loss rate is 95/5 when i line everything up!

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Wow !  You mean your win loss rate is 95/5 ?  Great !  I never saw something like this ! Can you show your statements? Thank you

--- 帖子 #968 ---
dude hahahah i dont use a metatrader broker.

ok i looked over the last month and ive just traded Aussie and eur/usd only.

The average win is around 9 pips i would say, now i know thats not much but i have a phobia of loosing my trade when im up 10 pips or so. the only thing that will cure that is continued consistency in my trading, that is my ultimate goal obviously, but if i just risk 3 % of my account and gain 3% daily on average then i will have a true compounding account.

by the way this has probably been my best month ever, i thank mihailo and norman hallet for inspiring me to keep diciplined

--- 帖子 #969 ---

15 to 20 pips or  the nearest fractal, but i get out if i see a reversal pattern on the 5 min chart using trix as the leading indicator of ending momentum, the same is true for my wins

Hi Ruten,

What settings do you have on your indicators:

- Osma & Macd

- Money Flow Index

- FIM

- Stochastic

- CCI

- EasyRiderSignals

I am asking, because that chart (indicators matching) looks different then mine.

Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Hi Simbad!

our indicators looks are different, because we are using a different brokers! (On  my opinion). I give you the template of this chart

--- 帖子 #981 ---
may have been right to publish not only successful but also errors so we can more quickly achieve positive results, all

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Thanks Ruten. Indeed... seems that difference comes from broker. I suspect that too, but wish to be sure

Thanks. Regards.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Im not that familar with the classic THV rules.

I use things like basic support resistance and wave theory but use the Trix on 5 as the leading confirmation. when the trix crosses near the zero line and/or there is divergence or just a cross all together seem to be powerfull when lined up with renko PA and trix and finally confirming with the 1 minute chart.

Hey abc man you seem to be getting some massive pips on your trades.

what is you success rate? are you exiting on the trix cross on the renko chart?

--- 帖子 #984 ---
It disappears somehow from your setup...

Just add it to the charts and everything will be settled if we are the same time zone.

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Fantastic!

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Good way of thinking!

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Thanks Mihailo. It works. Great.

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #988 ---
ahh another perfect 14 pips.

i went long Aud and not euro due to resistance.

aussie is in a big daily triangle!! if it breaks 1.0250 we are in a bull market!!

Thats all! 55+ pips for one day is very wonderful! Mihailo is greatest master!

Hi Mihailo,

Seems that still something is wrong on my platform, so I am asking you an opinion.

I am getting buy and sell signals, but there is no indicators agreement. It's pretty weird. You can check attached picture.

This is unmodified (it's the same) template as I download it from this place (Forum).

Maybe I have to switch to another broker? Hmm... I am thinking about that.

Even more after I saw Ruten's graph and setting. Things are very clear there.

P.S. I cut off the bottom of the chart, because there is just Trix, and it's not important for the problem I am writing about.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
EU +55p

AU +24p

GU +1p

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Dear Simbad! I received the same signals, but I am not trade it! Because is one question - where is the "Coral"? HA must to cross this line, and this is confirmation of this signal.

--- 帖子 #994 ---
First of all take a look to 5! brics. All of them should be in one color.

After you have to get the confirmation from TRIX.

Coral also as confirmation.

There is no any one strong signal for sell or buy. You have to look around all the picture and get final  decision by you mind.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
To Ruten and DmitryFX...

Thanks. But, I understand rules. I am not saying that that is signal to buy or sell. I said:

"I am getting buy and sell signals, but there is no indicators agreement."

It means, there is no reason for screen to be red in that case, and to appears pop up with attention message.

I know I have to wait Coral, Ichimoku etc... but what is weird to me is red (or blue) screen with pop up attention message... but I don't see the reason for that.

Because I understand from previous explanations that pop up message will appear in case of agreement OSMA & MACD, Money Flow Index, FIM, Stochastic and CCI. Or in case of agreement in EasyRyderSignals.

But, there is no any agreement, and my screen are colored and I am getting pop up message. You can see that in picture attached in my previous post.

This is the problem, and not the rules for entry trade

But, maybe this is normal... don't know. In that case, it's strange... because I am getting attention message with no reason (or I don't see the logic behind that alert message and pop up windows).

Sorry for my English... it's not my native language, so maybe I wasn't clear enough in my earlier massages.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
In this case you could just delete 5signalE indicator...

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Simbad,

Everything is ok

That signal on your picture is without coral included.

it is little bit early just as a warning for trade.

A i piše PAŽNJA!

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Hi!

I believe the system tries to antecipate a possible signal, so it gives the alert and put the background blue/red.

I believe it means there is a possibility in that actual  renko candle (that is not yet complete) that all signals can be aligned to create a valid signal.

Its only to warn you. That's my understanding, that might not be correct.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
So, if I understand well - it is normal that we are getting warning messages, and pops up even if there is no any agreement... on any indicator?

To be honest, I didn't saw that before.. trading with previous version of this system. So, this is the reason why I am confused with such kind of warnings now.

Anyway... thanks!

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Sorry for the my English too. It is a little bit.

So, there are the often pop up signals, which just killing my mind! Especially to night!    I will try to off it.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
As I explained here there is a two type of signals.

As I see there is a problem with this signals....

"5 SignalE" is indicator that generate those signals, so i will recode it that you can choose what signals do you want on your chart!

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Here is new "5 SignalE" with option to turn off early signals.

Now you can delete "3 spr sl" from your chart because "5 SignalE" contains all.

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Thanks Mihailo!

Wow! It's very cool!

Good sound, good window, good work!

Good luck!

Привет из Украины!

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Mihailo! Tell me please, what the name of indicator, which writing about sessions (Moskow, Frankfurt, London)?

As you can see on my pictures, these sessions are staying with no changes! Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
It is "Market Hours" indicator. If you don't see it in the list of the indicators, just add it on the chart and you will be able to see it, and to change the settings.

I am writing this, because I had also some problem with it.

P.S. Regarding problems with that indicator - it's strange because I can see different Market Hours on different charts inside the same MT4. All setting are the same, because I use the same template. And, I double check all that. Very strange. But... as is not vital indicator... I can survive with such situation

P.P.S. Now I see why there are different Market Hours on my charts - because initially, when I download and install all indicators and template, I wasn't able to see that indicator in the list. After that, Mihailo said I just need to put that indicator on the chart and everything will be ok. And, indeed... it is. But, not on all charts. Just on two pairs (charts). The other pairs has old (and not correct) Market hour times. I try to delete indicator from the list, but after deleting, there are still wrong (the same) Market hours time on the chart. So, there is somewhere that information... and it is not related to the indicator itself.

I open template file with notepad, but not sure what need to be changed - to be able to remove that wrong information, ant to attach correct Market hours indicator.

But, after all... it is strange, why it works ok on some pairs, and don't on other ones

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Market hours

If there is no change, I think that this is my mistake... I forgot to put it in the template.

Please add it on the each pair and save again the template.

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Thanks for the many information about this problem!

Hello friends.

What is the best time to operate this system?

Asian, European, American?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Who on Earth trade on Asian session????

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
well only sometimes does asian session trend, it ussually occurs with some heavy news on the day. Ive never really made money in asian session and ussually make my money on the 1st or 3rd wave move in a new established trend in the first few hours into europe session as more volume comes in and the big boys buy or sell where they see value!

so yea, europe and the cross to US session is the bomb.!!

so i made 15pips long aud and then handed it back on a re-entry, which im unhappy about cause it was against the system!!!

lesson learnt!! but after all that was my only loosing trade all week.

Hope everyone has had a great month trading and has a great christmas!!

see you next year.

Hi,

Thanks for good explanation of the issue. Ive got the same confusing signal alerts without indicator confimations. Seems like the first version was correct but this version has some false alerts. I am not sure. Following the alerts is not a good idea. But in the summery on my first days of this version I got correct alerts, but on other days later on thee efficient looses and no reasaons to follow the alerts which are based on the indicators. So I had to follow manually the indicators. These rules are apart from the coral rule for sure..

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
The very first version of "5 Signal" indicator.

It goes with indicator that I post here, 13 TxCSignal.

You dont need to have it on your chart , just in folder indicators.

Happy New Year to all!

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Last days the market was very unpredictable because of very low liquidity and other problems and may be we should not to make any total conclusions about last version system’s indicators ...

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
Ok So I will try with the last signalE alert as well.. (THE ONE ON PAGE 70) and will try some changings on the settings inside

WISH EVERBODY A HAPPY NEW YEAR WITH MONEY GOLD AND LOVE..

And finally Master Mihailo, thanks all for your care about the system and helping to questions even they are sometimes stupid..) But I have strong feelings, I will find the hint behind of this system will setup it at best and will grow on money in 2012..Its only about time of testings..My goal is a minimum of 50 pips per day, and in the entire workout performance I found its pretty possible in few hours of day. Best luck to everyone as well who believe and support in the positive way..

EDITED

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
hey guys, and thank you mihailo for all your effort.

i have issue after following the install instruction everything seems right but whenever i run mt4 or change period it take around 1-2 minutes to respond.

is that normal?

i have brand new i5 3.8ghz 8gb ram, running on demo account

Edit: seems that i found the indicators causing the problem, 13 * and M *, >:

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Milhailo, quick question for you, on the THV thread some time ago you showed great results from THV system. my question is, were you using renko blocks at that time because I notice that you have up a m2 offline chart.

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...50#post3311750

Im still following this thread but i need a better comp to load your template.

Thanks in advance.

edit: the m2 chart was visible on another statement you posted.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
Hi!

Its good machine, everything must work perfect...please post log file

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Hello Mihailo,

Have you ever try on a higher TF like 12H & Daily TF ?

THks.

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
Hi!

Yes those were my results!

Well....

Im in forex almost 4 years...

Without false modesty, I may be responsible for the claim to be an expert for trading with THV system, but...

It takes 16 hours of my day and lot of nerves... Its very stressful way of trading.

I found renko candles more obvious for trading... and even relaxed!

After all.... All indicators are basically the same.... They are showing to us the same picture.

YOU ARE THE MAIN FACTOR IN TRADING.

You have to live FOREX. You have to feeeeeeeeel FOREX.

You can not be a good Actor if you dont feel your role.

You cant be a good pilot if you dont feel your plane!

You can not be a good fighter if you dont feel the pain!

You can not brake granite slabs if you dont feel them!

You must develop a sixth sense for your acts in trading.

You must brake your bonds!

There is no ideal system, YOU ARE IDEAL!

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Why?

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
I can only watch markets after my job day, and I use bot. But I try to catch news ideas, and your system in higher TF could be one.

Tof.

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
Mihailo, don't listen anybody! Yours  system is BEST! Thank you!

Now, I will try to improve the appointment of stop-loss and take-profit, if you don't mind.

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
if I ask this question, it is only because this system is very interesting and his creator an opened person.

tof

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Yes but you didnt understand my simple question - "Why?"

In my system there is no higher or lower TFs.

Renko bars have nothing to do with the time.

Why to use something that you dont need?

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
After that, I have reread principles of renko blocks and I understand my mistake : box size instead of TF (for apologetically, I have not yet put your system on my MT4 cause my VPS is full and I wanted to keep some stability with my bots). But bigger boxe size mean bigger risk appetite. Thanks for your answer.</SPAN>

Tof

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Mihailo, could you please explain what was the reason of your choose of sizes of  RENKO bars - 5pips@3min & 13pips@2min? Just inresting! Have you tested other sizes - for example 15 or 25 pips? May be it's could be base for long term trading?

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
All indicators settings and all mathematic relations in my system are based on the Golden ratio

In my research I tried all combinations but this one gave me the best results.

It doesnt mean that will be the best for you or someone else.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Do you need to have all of the indis it references open on the chart as well, or can you just run it by itself?

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
MIhailo this is great system for less stress trading.

Check your PM, please.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Independent indicator!

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
ye the Golden Ratio  I not know what to say, but definitly not my capacity of mathematic. After reading a little bit I decide to concantrate of painting the charts line them with trends and look visually as to calculate with numbers..Someone did it before, thanks to them. However if you Master Mihalio understand the Formula's given their and uses in your indicators and/or/even do calculating with them for better setups  uhhh. I better do my job as as manager in the hotel and watch your setups . As I know you do a kind job as Sculpture, this degree of mathematic is enthuastic. Well just tell me you understand the Golden Ratio formula and use it to make better setups, did I really understand in this way. However even you not using yourself for calculations, it is nice to meet someone in FF who takes his job (hobby) very seiously and try to make some differences and know the efficient inside the indicators (how its work evt)..

Apart of this 2012 at the door markets are slow , I am very lazy cant push myself the markets..On this days I am working on some techniques on the chart to determine the near future of the PA ( hehe of course without mathematic) ..It is not easy, especially on this choopy days..

In other side I am trying to use your signal modify it to make more better accurate signals (inside the preferences) you signals are not based on market conditions ( simple it can not change from time to time). The market will move and always move and if move the signal comes, must of loose trades comes from ranges where I see the weakness..I need to customize it like if I hear the signal  this trade will accurate more as 70 % win well done if 80 % and will try this to do with play around the signal assignments M3 M2 Coral and so on..

But now celebrate the new year comes

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
wowww if you modified the system then work better at 80% currency please do not forget too put it the forum

many thanks

happy new year

it would be very worth while for you to have a look at Fibonacci ratio's and significant levels/ratio's according to the sequence. If you look far enough into the golden ratio, Fibonacci and fractals you'll see they can be applied to the human structure, financial markets and the solar system.

without over complicating this and trading off planetary harmonics, keeping certain high probability numbers in mind while trading gives an edge with trade entry's and exit's

72 !! massive number i think! the r1 pivot on Aud is on 72 today and its rejected it 3 times!

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
Sounds good you have a huge experience in this field. thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
So, I'm back. I just had to try this system and was browsing around how to make it work. And luckily, it does work now.

I've inserted the renko 3.4 version from the range block topic, not the 3.3 from the 1st post here. I guess thats what made the difference

Anyway, it seems to work fine now.

However, I have a few question, if you couls help me - I've numbered them on the attached pic:

1 - Can I resize the font showing the curency?

2 - Can I resize/move the market hours? Cant find it in the indicator window.

3 - What shows this price label?

I would also like to know where do I see the current price. I guess its the price under "Renko thv 5"... but it does not change itself; it changes only if I refresh the chart.

And... does the attached chart look normal to you, everything as it should be?

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
1. This is the version with possibility to change font size.

enter the indicator settings and change font size and set five digit broker on true.

2. Last 3 options in settings of the market hours use for position settings.

3. Click here!

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Thank you.

Something else.

The EUR/YPN chart is "waiting for update" and the USD/CAD shows only data for 15.12. - 16.12.

I also tried to insert another pair, followed the instruction about opening two 1M charts and so on, but when I want to open the offline charts there are no M2 and M3 charts for this pair available.

Also market hours do not change. Still have 5 hours left for London, for example.

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
If this is your demo acc please change broker

There is some problems with brokers with small "m" in the name of the pair.

I tried all that in FinFx demo and it works for me but for some people doesnt.

Anyway there is much more better brokers than FinFx

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Mihailo,

I noticed that the system is resource demanding. Attached is an improved version of RenkoChart. This one makes two renko charts at once. So, you can have only one 1min chart per your setup, not 2 like now. This should reduce the system requirement a little bit and decrease the number of charts.

have fun,

A.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
Excellent work!

Bravo majstore !

Hvala!

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
hey friends

just wanted to look how its going here

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
What does that mean now, that I can delete one 1M chart of each pair?

Or how do I apply this?

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
Yes, apply this EA on just one 1min chart. That one will make both 5-pip (on M3) and 13-pip (on M2) renko stuff.

Currently, one 1min chart makes 5-pip renko and the other 1min chart makes 13-pip renko.

You can change settings if you wish (pip size etc.) just as on a normal RenkoChart EA.

A.

These days I am playing (together with one of my friend) with your method, and it seems really good. However, we wish to do some modifications (and the next step will be probably an EA... will see), but we need indicators sources. Especially the ones that makes red and blue "bricks" (OsMA & MACD, MoneyFlowIndex, FiM, Stochastic, CCI and EasyRyderSignals).

Can you send me sources, or can I find them at some other place and where?

Thanks a lot!

Hi Mihailo,

Thanks for the quick reply!

The system is already updated as per today /4th Jan/ ! But the "Renko THV 5" PROFILE as per post 1 -> is still not working properly, ie EURUSD pair. When applied to an on-line 5min chart -> it works fine! I know it is not comfortable, but try to install the MT4 to a new PC, apply the system and you'll see what we all mean ...

What do you suggest?!

PS: I use FinFX as well ...

Hello Mihailo,

so after the last week, I wish you to be fine..I updated my charts from your post 1. While I was doing this I erased everything from the old charts as well erase everyhimg from folder

files of MT4.. Now I apply all system at new. When I was opening my MT4 it opened 2 charts of each pair in M3  (same charts?!) however EU/Jpy is only one 3 M chart..The other issue is some of them are refreshing like. But when I close and open the working charts are not working but the other yes. hmm..

As everbody wishes, my wish is also to have a system which can give me at least 30-50 pips minimum per day, a system which alerts me to start trade with a simple -15 SL +15 TP so I have not to watch straight all day to the chart.. This system can do it but needs some fine tunings / at least I feel it. Still I have no experience how to make a indi and hope to see it from experienced coders

good we have them here in FF

Good morning from French,

And sorry for my very very very bad english ...

I just finish to read this excellent thread. I am not really a newbie but I stop trading since severals years ... after lose a lot of money.

So I come back because Sir Mihailo and his perfect strategy developped here. In demo before !

I install with success this Renko System 's Mihailo. But my PC is old and my connexion is bad. So I try to keep only 3 or 4 charts like EU, GU, AU ... Suppose I can shut the others without problems ? Sure I keep M1, M2 and M3 of my 3 or 4 charts.

I have a big admiration for Sir Mihailo which gives us here free of charge its strategy, the best strategy, and answers with patience our questions.

So I come back trading

Thank's a lot Master Mihailo

Hi Mihailo,

First thanx for your system, and I'm trying to start trading on your system from tomorrow for testing.

What currency pairs do you recommend and what time blocks you advice for trading for each currency pair. Planing to trade on 2 - 3 currency pairs with your system from tomorrow.

Thanx in Advance,

Hi Mihailo and all,

I have a question to all you out there.

does anyone have a trading plan that includes not only the strategy they trade but pre/post trading routines, journaling and mental analysis??

If so, can anybody say that they have followed a trading plan to the T?

Even if its a loosing system in the end has anyone followed a set off rules and traded as if they where a clerk or employed by someone to only trade particular setups like a prop trading firm would have you do if you worked in one?

Im very interested to hear what you all have to say to this.

the reason why i ask is that i have come to realise that there is a next level in trading and i believe that if we can be disciplined enough to not stray away from  a trading plan andn change things all the time that we can be successful!

easier said than done, but all the pro traders think this way and thats why they make money.

so can anyone honestly say they have followed a trading plan for atleast 3 months and not changed anything??

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
thanks for the very good system has you may know when you download all your system all my plateform goes very slown please could you advised if we can off some off the pair

many thanks

Hi Mihailo

Since i like RENKO, i've been lurking here for several months and the concept of Renko mixed with THV is a good idea for a strategy, it's SWEET & SIMPLE, Good Job

so i just converted these 2 Docs to PDF to make it easier for some that don't have or use the other file format.

Hi

I am fallowing your system and right now I starting demo account testing.

1. Can you tell me how to switch off v1.3 alarm.

2. And how to switch off alarm that market will be closed in ......

3. How to turn off screen going red and blue and price labels(I am not using them)

4. Early Signal in Easy reader (what that really mean).

Thanks for great stuff.

Hi Jon,

Do you mean that you'd like to have the trading plan of everybody if it exists?

I'm still not in profit since i began trading, but maybe one day

I noticed that using demo accounts is more profitable than real accounts. Not only because of leverage, but maybe because we are not affected by loosing or not the money. I tried to copy paste my method to real accounts => still not working.

It would be easier if i had more than 10 000€ on my account. I'm interested also about your idea i really think that trading is essentially psychologic. I try to focus on Pivot Points (intraday), they have their own logic. One time if price is under pivot, he's going to touch it to go back next, and some other time, it touch it, go threw and continue this way without coming back.

Today for example price began under pivot point, touched support 1, go back to pivot and then first resistance, for coming back to pivot point for now. Where will be the price tonight? Maybe to R1, or S1. I prefer think S1 because it often gets back to the initial way : day began under pivot. Wait and see

Hello to everyone!

I came from vacation and ready to trade starting Monday!

As I see this thread is became something that I didnt want.

Please dont post changes that you do on my system. Start your own thread and show your results.

Please dont post screens of trades witch are made on timeframes. Nobody cares about that. This is renko thread.

I made this thread to discuss about trades and help to each other to earn some money with my system.

NO CHANGES! NO TIMEFRAMES!

PLEASE READ THREAD AND MANUALS.

DONT ASK  QUESTIONS THAT ARE ALREADY ANSWERED.

DONT COMPLAIN!

IF ONE OF YOU CAN INSTALL THIS SYSTEM, EVERYBODY CAN.

If you are a rookie in trading go somewhere else to learn and came again to use this system. This system is for formated traders, not for newbies.

THANK YOU ALL FOR UNDERSTANDING. IM HERE TO HELP YOU BUT DONT WASTE ME!

I DONT HAVE ENERGY TO TEACH EVERYBODY WHAT IS FOREX AND HOW TO USE MT4.

Hii bro,

I'm too a renko trader

My hearty congrats for such a good system

I'm with a broker who's instruments shows '.m' suffix .... eg. EURUSD.m

that's bcoz i've opened pro account for floating spreads

can i have a template optimized for any instruments ?

like for xau,xag,audcad etc

please create a template alone that can be applied for any renko charts of any instruments ...

looking forward for your kind reply soon...

take care & happy pipin'

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
Hi!

Will do that!

Your broker?

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
That's so sweet of you bro

Anyway i'm with Roboforex

Thanks so much for your kind reply

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
Thats strange Marzer !! I use Robo's pro standard account too, and I am sure there is no "m" suffix, not even in the pro cent or fix accounts, same for ECN. Sure you are not using their demo?

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
oops... you are right bro, i'm currently demo'ing renko strategy before i go live ...

i'm too having pro standard account

and there's no '.m' suffix on live ... but on demo, there's

anyways i wanted a separate template for using on any instruments

that's all... i'm waiting for it buddy

First trade of the week, I have jumped on it a bit early with trix cross, got out early too as 1.02 is a pretty good number, could turn into a support. But I still believe this trade could last a little longer .. anyway .. that was a damn good 35.6 pip run .. who wants more

Mihailo, Будьте здоровы мой друг

Can anyone who has this system running, tell me what hardware platform they are using. I have spent alot of time trying to get it to run so it is usable, but no luck!

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
I am running it on an ancient laptop (1.6 C2D, 1 GB Ram, Windows 7 32 bit) with no problem at all (5 pairs at a time). This system is a bit resource hungry but its nothing serious. And after last update (with the new ea), its faster than ever.

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
Thanks AmareX...I am using a i5/8GB laptop...so should be okay. What sort of data feed are you using..speed?

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Broadband 512 kbps. I dont think net speed would be a issue, If you are having stability problem with your monster laptop, then you may want to re-install your mt4, update to latest version, gather M1 data from broker for each pair you want to use. I dont see any other reason here. Best of luck

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
Makem0ney!!!

The problem is with your RENKO settings or s.th with the software!

My laptop is 3yrs old, dual core with win7 4gb ram -> and the system works perfectly well!!

My MT4 terminal's CPU Memory usage is 83k, when google chrome is 120k and above!!!

Do reinstall the system /mt4 etc./ and try again! Good luck mate ...

Hi to all. What do you think about this signal guys?

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
Just curious to know if you are running on windows7 and 64bit computing ??

Let me know...

hi gj6n68, laptop is using W7, 64 bit. Also have tried on an old WXP pc...same issues.

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Mihailo, why color in indi change?

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
Well here's another trade on AU. The signal was crystal clear so I guess many of you took it too. My initial target was yesterday's high (20 pips) but there was a pullback from today's high (which is actually normal because of some profit taking) but then PA was consolidating around that level so I didn't take any chance, took 13 pips (at today's high) and out. By the time I am typing this post, PA finally broke yesterday's high ... Thats my luck!!

This trade was a very important lesson to me, many times I have suffered this Hope-Greed-Fear cycle. I denied the obvious logic and allowed my emotion drive me.

Anyway, thats around 50 pips for me today, see you guys tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
make sure the offline chart is 3 minute if not it will crash the mt4.

Hi!

1. First of all your current time is not in the same time zone as your broker.

2. Renko candles are not the time candles. Candle can be open in 13.29 and be closed in 19.17 if there is no movement in candle range.

you accept not rule from system, you make you trades but not with rule. first trade, in this point are m2 in the sel zone and ma are a long was from buy. after you first buy you must have one sell, the rule are all o.k. only rule with pivot are not o.k. not 25 points to pivot (blue line). later buy are againg with o.k. rules but not with rule 25 point to pivot. you have open trade with smal range to pivot r4. you pips are mor lucky, and not with the system you have you own system with filters but not from topic.

I searched the thread for repainting issues with the red/blue block indicators, but found nothing.  I've seen these indicators repaint numerous times now.  The first picture i attached all blocks were blue and gave a long signal.  The current block turned down a bit and as a result it repainted the prior column from blue to neutral blocks.  I understand the current column of blocks can change because its adjusting to what price is doing, but the prior column will also change as well.

Is it because the early signal feature is turned on?

Hi Mihailo,

I'm using your system from two weeks now and I have three concerns regarding your system. Pls check the following concerns of me,

1) How to solve the chart repainting problem. Like some of them noticed I also have the same problem and previous bars are repainting. If you can pls update the profile and templates in the 1st post with the profile and template your using now.

2) And apart from all the things in your charts(Economic news, Daily pivot and support lines, all the indicators), what else your taking in to consideration before you enter to a trade. I mean your considering only these things showing in the chart OR your checking more things like how the currency pair moves in this week, mental S&R levels, etc. from other sources.

3) Can you pls tell me who are the brokers your using to trade this system(Mihailo RENKO system).

Pls answer to my concerns as soon as you can. Thank you for helping us to trade with your strategy.

Thanx in advance,

-Ishara

A question about the flat trand indy.

What does it mean when it turns grey and what when it has no colour?

--- 帖子 #1199 ---
I think something like that: no colour no trend

--- 帖子 #1200 ---
Finally,

after I read whole thread 2 times I decided to go with this system because I think Mihailo is one of the greatest trader and can learn much from him.

I started trading on my micro account and so far system seems great but the trader is not good enough

I NEED MORE PATINCE AND DISCIPLINE!!

Overall result for today is -6 pips

EUR/USD: +21

1.) -6 my mistake because trix isn't good

2.) +15 this was great trade by the rules

3.) +12 little bit late entry because coral is to far, but plus is plus

EUR/JPY: -18

1.) -25 total unnesesery trade because trix on M2 is above coral

2.) +7 I chikened out.Angry at myself it could be + 15

GBP/USD: -9

1.) +7 scalp trade by rules till R1

2.) +9 another scalp trade

3.) -25 same thing like eur/jpy M2 is above coral and no short

Sorry for my long post and bad english

MIHAILO PLEASE FREE TO COMMENT MY TODAY TRADES.I WANT TO LEARN.

ATTACHEMNT ON SECOND POST

hvala!

I got only the first morning trade. The second was missed and the others also..

No problem, here is:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I think i have to comment it...

As you can see I had open position in the last Friday and close it only Yesterday. It was because all day Friday I've been waiting for retracement.

If you have a look at Week's or even Day's charts you could see that all trend indicators says about strong bullish trend, more of it we have the divergence at Weekly's OsMA  and as we know "Trend is our friend". So, as soon as retracement began I bough Euro. It was possible to take some profit - about 20p - at the end of London's session, but I was absolutely sure about my position and stay it opened for weekend. The Monday gave us good sign as gap and finally +70p.

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
Ok. Thank you.. But I thought that you got +70 pips yesterday only.. Your strategy is not intraday by Mihailo signals as he described.. And your DD was too much (about -40 pips).. Hmm..

What do you think about this intraday signal?

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
My position by EU still open from yesterday at 3035. I look for TP at 3120. Today is ECOFIN Meetings and trend can be changed. Will see...

--- 帖子 #1209 ---

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
no.. +4pips only.. and I missed some good entries on AUDUSD and GBPUSD.. profit only on EURJPY..

Morning all,

would like to know, why I have 2 M3offline charts from the same pair. I dont know which one to erase if, cause both are refreshing not exact the same. If I get a signal from one the other gives later the same signal, but sometimes not, also repaintings are different on the indis sometimes the other follows later. The multiple charts I have from each pair as M3 offline except the EU and GU.. When I was installing this I erased all charts. It was chrystal clear before I apply a profile..So this effects also to hear a alert twice and sometimes only once..I will give an example below.. Both are saved in same time.. clearly you can see that tone chart is blue and has another price on the left corner, the Osma Macd is different colored, the Fcal is in different place, on other charts we can see also the signal appaers but not in the other one.. Or is this the normal issue it must stay so perhaps.. I was waiting for a while before testing this nice work but such situations are confusing me in the test..Thanks for help

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
I agree.. EURUSD & GBPUSD buy-signals..

It's look like OsMA&MACD indi @ second chart with early signal.

So my issue seems to be different, I have two charts on M3 offline.. However now I am facing another surprise, 4 charts multiple M3 dissepears (only some indis are shown), so now I have only one chart multiple with all indis and candles. The 4 other multiple charts are there but the candles and so indis are not there.. However it seems like after a while it will be correcting itself..The system has many alert functions apart from the rules to follow manuel, even the trix v1.01 has inside many alerts itself..Because I was a while not stick with Mihailo's nice system, I need to start to test all varations to find a best lookout for myself.

1. Enter "5 signalE" properties and set chart signal on false, enter EasyRiderSignal properties and check early signal on false.

2. Depends on your skills and expiriance.

3. You can trade every broker with my system... Do a research and find one that sutes you the best. This is not commercial part of FF. I cant recommend anyone.

I don't know what is it.. I have this question myself ))

You have before or later another indi which confuses the reading in text. I had this problem before as well but not quit remember where exact. Perhaps best way is to uninstall and reinstall some indis either all system my advise. I remember that I uninstall from chart the indi and install it back in same place, so it was solved renamed it..

Its EasyRyderSignal, but I renamed it because there was some guy on this thread who was complaining on everything....

I've requested a customized template for applying on any instruments

i've been waiting 2 weeks ....

just dropping a reminder bro...

thanks for this awesome system

awaiting your reply sir...

Operations (input - output) of the graphics are not EA.

Look at post 92, Mihailo:

"Just grab your trade With A right click from a list and drop it on your chart and it Will appears."

(If this does not mean, excuse me but translation problems do not get it better)

My morning profit are EURUSD +27 pips & AUDUSD +34 pips..

but... I don't have profit always by this system.. sometimes + and sometimes - and total = minus.. I don't know why.. hmm..

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
Do you have any statement here, at least demo?

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
I have some deals in the demo-account but I am not trading all days and all sessions.. and made others deals with another system in this account.. as I know Mihailo has statement.. and he gave graf of it in this thread..

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
Are you following to m2 chart trend?

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
Usually yes

Dmitry, I see your view of market on AUD EUR and GBP (under your posts). Is this view formed with Mihailo Renko system?

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Of course no. Mihailo gave us very useful tool for intraday trading, but we have to keep in mind what is going on around market.

Just as example for EU:

So, still the mainstream says us go to long it's too risky to go short.

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
the reason for this is that your losers are bigger then your winers

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
because these types of systems never work.... FF is littered with em. learn to read price and return your chart to a simple form.

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
Post your loses and i will comment if there is any mistake.

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
Great strategy,I took 200 pips today,it was a demo but never mind...strategy is perfect and Mihailo

--- 帖子 #1257 ---
Thank you Mihailo.. I said about this in general.. I will try to post my lost deals in the future.. May be my loses because SL is small.. Usually I use 20 or 25 pips maximum and trailing stop is about 17-20 pips for each pair

Браво!

Свака част!

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
Hi Mihailo..I want to download your system but when ı download it, my MT4 can't do it because my screen is freezing..How can ı solve this problem ??

--- 帖子 #1260 ---
Mihailo is this valid signal on AUD-chart?

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
It's not very valid by system, but if keep in mind current market situation - it's was really good signal. I've bough au at 0625 and sold at 0675. +50p!

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
Valid signal with small TP around 10 pips caused with PIVOT LINE!

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
One more time Thanks for your system.

Until now these week (1:36PM)

EUR/USD   +3%

GBP/USD   +5%

EUR/JPY     no valid sygnal for me so 0%

To everyone - dosen`t matter how many pips are you making, IT DOES  MATTER HOW MUCH MANY so PROFIT/LOSS in % show real score of your TRADES.

Mihailo can you post Market Hours as separate indi that I can add extern variable to turn alarm off (i like countdown but ALARM drive me nuts )

Right now I am trading on demo account in ALPARI UK. Work fine. If results will continue fine I will post my MM and rules for it (2 options depend of market).

Good Luck to everyone - be patient for PROPER signals Just yesterday I wait all bloody day just for one BUT it was +1%. Today already 3

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
Nice work!

--- 帖子 #1265 ---
but you can not robotize this system? I managed to make it through a copy of the 3d easy1.3 but only how to put all I do not know how to do it

Thanks again.

Nice Job

I guesses that you are using some triling stop.

Can I ask what settings you have on gold.

Keep working pal - I wish you best results. Tomorrow another day

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
Hi Mihailo,

Thanks a lot for sharing your system with us. Just started demoing it and will keep you posted as to how it goes...

I've read through the entire thread (took me more than 3 days !!) and I was able to setup all fx charts without any issues and added couple of my preferences (additional fx charts) as well.

The only issue I have is with Gold charts. When the gold charts are set up (exactly like you have mentioned in the post 689), the mt4 platform gets stuck. I repeated the gold set up few times (and made sure its as per instructions) and every time the mt4 stops responding. Without the gold charts everything works fine. Any idea as to why this could be happening ?

Cheers !

D

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
Thanks bro,

i'm not using trailing stops

and for gold i'm using 250pip box size

happy pippin' amigo's !!!!

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
Hi Makzer,

Seems you are trading Gold successfully.. As mentioned in my previous post, I am not able to set up gold charts as the mt4 platform gets stuck. I have followed instructions exactly as mentioned by mihailo.

Appreciate if you can detail out the steps you followed to set up the gold charts. Also when you say 250pip box size, do u use the same size for M2 and M3 ? Thanks in advance !

D

--- 帖子 #1275 ---
At the beginning I want to thank Milhailo for the system! A year ago I tested something similar, but not coming out. It is much better. Sorry for my english.

1.Do you uses divergences (trix)?

2.How to disable the alarm?

Today's my play.

Greetings to all fans of Renko System

Hi Mihailo

Thanks for your outstanding work, I am asking for your help as I spent all night trying to add your templates to other pairs (for ex. NZD/USD), Now is 9 am and still couldn't manage.

I have tried to read the posts but I couldn't find anything to help me so please apologies if somehow this has been discussed somewhere and I skipped it.

So my question is, how could I apply your template to new pairs - given that when I click to open offline charts, I can see the M2 charts present under any pair, but not the M3 that is required in your system.

When I open profiles I can see only few M3 pairs (EJ, EU,GU,UC and AU).

So how could I get a M3 chart for other pairs - for ex - as I mentioned above NZD/USD.

Can you please help....

Many thanks in advance

Dear Mihailo!

On post #5344895 ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...95#post5344895) I see that you use a new indicator (13 wpr 34), can you add it to rar file on first post of this thread and everyone can try it.

Thank you so much for a good system

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
Hi all.

My thanks to Mihailo and other guys who help us. I am very interested in this system, I know and use the THV system.

I have installed a new MT4 on a PC that I use for trade only and in this I installed the Renko System with Mihailo.

MT4 takes over 2 minutes to start and then freezes. After 2-3 minutes it starts correctly.

I checked all the post and have not found a solution to this problem.

My pc is used exclusively for trade and any other system causes these problems.

Someone can help me?.

My pc is AMD Athlon II X3 455 3.30 GHz, with 4GB of RAM and Win 7 64 bit. I think it has enough power.

Thank you very much. My apologies for my poor English.

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
follow these steps:

1. uninstall the installed mt4 in your PC.

2. extract the "packet 1!" rar file again.

3. go to indicator folder and delete the file "5 signalE".

4. now install mt4 and then copy the extracted indicators, EA's to the mt4 folders.

5. now run the mt4.

if still problem exists do reply.

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
Thank you very much for your response, but the problem continues.

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
i had that same issues but resolved by removing "5signal!" indi if this indi is already installed then set it to "false". that is what i know...mihalio can help you if something else is there.

--- 帖子 #1288 ---
hello mihalio,

can you make a EA for your renko candles only ?

Entry rules: full length bullish or bearish candle.

Exit rules: doji formed or the opposite candle occurs.

Also include TP, SL and trailing stop.

Thankyou

--- 帖子 #1289 ---
I've solved the problem. Basically I installed another version of MT4 on another hard drive partition.

And do not forget to install and activate the Renkolivechart expert advisers in M1

It work!

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
Hi friends, I have a few problems with the system, please help to understand:

A. Adviser to install and then open the M3 autonomously. Includes the template, but it included about 10 minutes. the terminal hangs. What to do?

Two. Error as shown below.

Three. schedule does not move.

4. Mini does not appear M2.

The new MT4 is not installed on the system disk.

do not work the basic functions, I can not even make the screen display.

What should I do?

Computer:

Core 2 Quad

4GB

win 7 pro

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
I'll explain as I have resolved. I installed MT4 on another hard drive partition (D: ), then I copied the contents of Paket 5! into the corresponding folders.

I open MT4, then activated expert advisors  (must have the green arrow), I dragged Renkolivechart v3.3x2 to, for example, EURUSD M1, I selected profiles Renko THV 5, and, after a while frozen, the system works perfectly.

All in this sequence!.

Sorry for my English

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
Thank you very much! it worked! ok I'll start to learn the system, as in Turn it became clear  sorry for the English.

--- 帖子 #1293 ---
Mihailo, i looked at your work in Facebook .. I really liked. You're a very talented sculptor!!!

--- 帖子 #1294 ---
Nice work

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
I can't get the script to work..

It doesn't do anything..

I drag it to my 1m charts and nothing happens.. also tried 2m and 3m charts.

I have correctly installed it.. and I have also correctly installed RENKO.. I think..

I can't find any history.rar to download from first post..

Is that still nessasary?

--- 帖子 #1296 ---
Yes history is very important

You'll find it at the bottom of post #57
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...63#post5104063

--- 帖子 #1297 ---
Thanks!

I have been reading very many pages and looking for people who have traded this system long time to see if they are successful.. but can only find people who have tested a few trades.

This system sounds amazing because easy rules to follow and minimal discretion needed.. and best of all.. You don't need to look for trend on higher time frames.. only follow the rules.

But it just sounds too easy..

Also that risk:reward is something like 2:1 or 3:1.... which is terrible.

r:r should be opposite... 1:2 or 1:3... or at least 1:1.

So I havent read every post yet but I'm working on doing that.. but has anyone had success following this system 100% by rules and not looking trend on other time frames for a long time? at least 100 trades?

--- 帖子 #1298 ---
Hi professor Pi

Reading from people's posts, the wins are more than the losses provided you don't have tight SL's and this is where the high risk comes from. The logic is that if the conditions are right and you wait long enough the market will go in your direction.

The manual states that you need to have additional reasons for taking a trade , eg bounce from S&R, pivots, divergence etc

How is Sweden these days?

I heard recently that it was pretty cold....

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
Have you been able to make it work ???

If not let me know and I'll try and help you out....

Regards

--- 帖子 #1300 ---
Didn't get it to work..

But I'm not sure if I want to try this system before someone can verify that system works in the long run.. with many trades... and considerable ROI.

Like I said in my last post.. R:R and not having to care about the trend from higher time frames sounds crazy.

I really hope it works though because trading with trend is hardest thing in forex I think.. Look at higher time frames and do trend lines, fib etc... You never know how far the retracement go.. or if it's reversing.. or if what you thought was uptrend is just retracement of even high time frames downtrend. And when you go and look at threads like usd/jpy or eur/usd then 50% of people are making analyze that says it will go up and 50% say down. Argh It's so hard knowing what the trend is hehe

--- 帖子 #1301 ---
All I can say is that trading is more about you then what system you use.

You could have best systems and you wont be able to make winning trades, and you could have just a normal system but still make enough winners.

As for this system, I believe, because it is based on Renko chart, time-frame doesn't play as much part. May be I am wrong, but it would surely help if you do some reading on range, renko, point & figure etc. I guess trend would get included in these kind of charts from my understanding.

As for giving this system a try, entirely upto you, but if you are just searching for a system which someone else has made and would give you exact entry/exit points, without any hard work on your part, and also give you r:R of your choice, then I would say my friend may be you are looking in wrong place.

FF is the place where people put forward their ideas in different form, everyone helps to fine tune it, everyone learns and teaches and along with profits.

I am not trying to undermine you, just letting you know that if you try out a system and than decide if it is for you or not, it would be worth because it would be your experience. You can't wait for enough people to try a syste and let you know about their experience. Instead of waiting for that time, I would rather try it myself, fine tune it the way I want and than decide if I want to use it further or not.

Apart from all these, send PM an email if you need to set it up.

I don't keep checking all the forums everyday, there are loads of wonderful knowledge gaining threads, which is more fascinating then the pips I could make.

Regards

--- 帖子 #1302 ---
Fair enough.. I'm kindof new to forexfactory.. And the impression I get when reading the OP is that the system is complete already.. that he is just helpful and sharing it with us who are still struggling.

I'll take some more looks at this tomorrow perhaps.. There's many systems to choose between.. I need a scalping system.. this one attracts me because of only needing 1 TF.

--- 帖子 #1303 ---
hello mihalio,

can you make a EA for your renko candles only ?

Entry rules: buy after one bullish candle completed (2nd blue candle)

Exit rules: close after one bearish candle completed (2nd red candle)

<<vice versa for short position>>

Also include TP, SL and trailing stop.

Thank you

Mihailo isn't making EA's because they don't work

--- 帖子 #1305 ---
I need lots of money!

can you wire it now to me?

hahahaha

take some advise from someone who has done alot of testing and created alot of renko ea's:

renko ea's might work,but not on MT4 as the data is scewed in backtesting to make us believe that the ea will turn big wins.

Wrong, we are being scammed, ea's dont work on metatrader unless foreward testing proves accurate, any backtest will not show correct results.

trading systematically with dicipline with a manual entry is the holy grail.

its not as exciting as you might believe.

learn to trade from the pro's.

--- 帖子 #1306 ---
Hi,

I think this method is amazing and i keep coming back to it as it is very reliable compared to most others ive traded.

I understand your concernes when it comes to RR and the old 15 pips profit all the time. Its hard to stomach such bad RR but it is reliable and consistant, i havent traded 100 plus positions my self but i have done alot of manual backtest and like to just trade with aud/usd and Eur/usd pairs taking maybe 1-2 trades per day but sometimes non at all as im in australia and all the action occures when im asleep.

I have been looking for a solution to a few issues i see here.

1. RR

2. reliance in lagging indicators (easyryder signals)

the solutions i wont go into detail as its not my forum but ive found that if you overlap a 13 bar renko on the chart using zig renko indicator you see the structure of the market in price, using fractals on a 13 bar renko gives you trend as well as 54 and 72 coral both the same colour give a good trend to. enter on pull backs to the corals and 13 bar structure.

RR is ussually 3:1 nad you catch the start of the trend.

its like the floor trader method for renko.

ive found trading on pullbacks is the best for RR.

good luck

--- 帖子 #1307 ---
Hi John

A couple of Q's pls.

How long have you been using this technique for?

What are the m2 charts for and if we don't use them can I close them or will this upset the other charts?

How do you decide the ideal moment for entering a trade?

To determine my exact entry point I use a separate 1 min chart.

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
I am happy that you are going to give fwe things a try.

Just once more, there is no time frame in renko my friend, please go and read about it.... renko is about the number of ticks/pips.... doesn't matter how much time it takes...

Hope you read about range, renko, etc.. etc. etc... all the best...

--- 帖子 #1309 ---
Dear,

Anyone know how to recover the history of coral m2? I am using a new computer two weeks and the coral has not yet appeared.

Greetings.

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
Hi, ive traded this since november, alot of my results are posted here, most the trades look the same so i dont need to post all my trades, have a look over those trades. i think the best trades occur without a big move previously that can be seen on a 5 min chart, but you can take all trades just using the renko chart. if you are diciplined and only go for good trades that arent risking more that 30 pips and only trade less volitile pairs then you will make 3% a week easily with a loss here and there.

hope this helps

--- 帖子 #1311 ---
i requested mihailo not you to make EA for me.

this thread is the mihalio thread. you are no one to stop me for asking help.

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE A EA that is why i gave my specifications in my post with entry and exit rules.

i know these are offline no time frame charts. back testing not possible. forward testing can be tested. those who believe ea's don't work in renko charts neither they created the charts nor they wrote any ea.

P.S. if EA don't work in renko charts then You could have a script attached to the renko chart that writes signals to a file. the EA, attached to an online chart, would read those signals from the file and act accordingly.

there are possibilities. don't be overconfident.

--- 帖子 #1312 ---

if you want to write an ea you can downloand molanis and make it yourself its really easy.

maybe mihailo is not on this forum anymore cause its turned into people wanting to be spoon fed information instead of taking initiative to find it out on there own and asking the same questions 10 times!

good luck with your trading!!!

Fist of all, Thank you very much for sharing your strategy.

I installed all of your files but as you see, the m3 chart's timeframe is very strange.

I don't understand what timeframe it is.

please help me!!

--- 帖子 #1320 ---
As I understand, there is no need to copy history's files. Just open m1 charts of each pair, disable autoscroll and push and hold "PageUp" button for 10-15 seconds. Then refresh template on M3 and it must be ok.

--- 帖子 #1321 ---
I think there is no problem on your screenshot. Perhaps it seems strange to you because it's renko bars - not range. Renko charts are "time independent" charts that do not have constantly spaced time axes. They have a pre-determined "Brick Size" that is used to determine when new bricks are added to the chart. The brick size of Renko THV system is 13. Maybe this feature made you doubt.

--- 帖子 #1322 ---
When I go to load a template it makes my MT4 terminal go non responsive and my computer memory keeps going up until I run out of memory and get an error.

I'm trying it on a HotForex demo.  Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #1323 ---
You could try running MT4 when your computer isn't running many applications so close all programs and try it again.

Perhaps you've loaded a busy profile.

Before loading the THV templates Go to FILE PROFILES and open the default profile. If you've corrupted your default profile then loan another one of the simple profiles like EURO etc.

If the template you are trying to load is using all your PC's resources then try a different one. There are several different templates in the thread so browse through the attachment list and try a different one.

Hi everyone

I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this thread as I have enjoyed reading it many times.

I have tried to in stall the system 3 times on different computers and cannot update the m3 and m2 screens.

I have tried placing the history files in the history folder.

Ive tried

"Just open m1 charts of each pair, disable autoscroll and push and hold  "PageUp" button for 10-15 seconds. Then refresh template on M3 and it  must be ok."

and still I have no luck.

I am approaching 2days of effort to resolve this issue with no solution yet, and I will not give up on this awesome system.

There must be a way to get this to work ..

Please if someone could help I would greatly appreciate it.

I know this has been talked about many times which makes it all the harder to be sitting here with out the current date on the 2m and 3m charts.

So check list

I have expert advisers turned on

M1 chart scrolled back(it has live chart)and platform restarted

history downloaded

not micro acct

What am I missing

--- 帖子 #1328 ---

--- 帖子 #1335 ---
hi everybody,

1st of all thx for sharing this idea. i just set it up and will try to help develop this system as i think i might be a great opportunity for traders which understand how it works.

let me begin with one small suggestion. i think it would be much easier and more comfortable if the indicators folder is included in the experts folder. so you only have to copy 3 folders without the subfolder into the mt4 directory.

here we go, i need some help ^^

as u can see in the attachment i get no red/short signals at the bricks and in some more cases it differs from the examples a saw.

i installed it allready on 6 °!° different mt4 and i was "playing" a lot with the ea and the indis. i dont get it managed to look like it should.

is it true that the history is not needed any more ?  i tried it also with the a history file but it made my high end machine crash. so i would prefer to run it w/o history files.

hope somewone can help out a bit.

thx

stefan

btw: yes i read ALL posts in this thread ^^

--- 帖子 #1336 ---
first you have no renko chart!

renko candels is only on the charts with renko history for history you need someitems one tick on the chart who you have placed renko ea. if no one tick (weekend) on the chart renko make not histori m2 ore m3.

the temmplate you can take on the chart m2 ore m3 look picture.

Then:

- Put the Font to  C:\Windows\Fonts

- Put all MT4 files to it's place:  ...\experts , ....experts\indicators , ...\profiles, ...\templates, etc ...

I just want to try to import the  "13***"  indicators to my MT4, including EasyRider 1.1, 1.2 & 1.3.

But it makes my MT4 very sloooooooooooooow .... & some times it makes my MT4 hang / stop working !!!  I need about 10 minutes just to see the "13.CCI" indicator & almost the same for other indicators of Renko system.

I'm using Windows XP & MT4 version 416 !!. I didn't got this problem before with THV system, or other systems.

How to solve this ??? Please help .....

Thanks

yes renko make mt4 slow.

--- 帖子 #1339 ---
If renko is slowing down MT4, you could try reducing the number bars the renko script looks back at ie set MaxBars to 5000. It worked for me.

Hello everyone.

Read this thread to the point...

Well, i can only Admire Mihailo, trying to sincerely help everyone...

But man... how much do some people need to be spoonfed!??

With all basic questions answered several times to the core - just read the f*** thread 1st,  goddam*it!

PS: sorry for the "f" word ^^'

I have 2 questions:

1)What role play this indicator?(marked white at pic)

2)How to acces to it settings and delete it?

--- 帖子 #1345 ---
Hi Mihailo!

Thanks for the great system. I want to add a little to it. I have rewritten a B-clock indi for Renko candle, so it shows the pips until to close the next long  or short Renko candle.

The sense of it, that easier to calculate the stop level, at case of different Renko candle  lengths, if somebody forgot which chart which Renko length.

--- 帖子 #1346 ---
Thanks, I have been looking for an indicator like that for a long time!

Can you make it graphically show where the long and short candles will close with a horizontal, dashed line?

That would be great!

--- 帖子 #1347 ---
Sorry for the sudden posting, so I have noticed some error. The calculation was not correct.

This version works fine with Renko length under 10 pips at 4 digit brokers.

Dax and gold do not seems to be correct, I will look after at weekend, as very good moving now.

Maybe provide a version of the vertical lines as well.

--- 帖子 #1348 ---
Friday, 13th, but is a lucky day for shorters

Well, the graphs calm down, so have some time to improve this renko counter indies.

Improvements: Shows the Renko size in the upper right corner

Shows the actual candle possible closing price (in case at long and short)

Please test is at different broker with different instruments, and if something do  not works fine, feel free to complain

I have attached a screenshot how I used it.

--- 帖子 #1349 ---
That's great, thanks!

--- 帖子 #1350 ---
Thanks a lot for this useful indi, but some more options would be very helpful:

1) Show 4 pips only even if on 5 pip broker. (I am on 5 pip broker but would like it to show ''RENKO: 9'' pips instead of 90)

2) Colour, line style and line width options for lines

3) True/false for showing pips left (personally I just like the lines)

Thank you very much and have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #1351 ---
I agree, "RENKO: 10" is better than "RENKO: 100" and I do not need the pips left either.  The lines are what I wanted.

Thanks, again, FXKred.

--- 帖子 #1356 ---
Hi Mihailo,

As I can see above (Linked Explorer: Kosovo je Srbija  | Demo Account XXXXX73)  you trade only EURUSD,  is this an EA with your Renko sistem?

--- 帖子 #1357 ---
This is certainly the EA, but trade only with EURUSD, without GBPUSD,EURJPY,AUDUSD and other...

Why not put the EA on the other pairs ?

Does EA works only for EURUSD?

Thanks Mihailo!

--- 帖子 #1358 ---
I have improved the Renko counter indicator, setted the alerts at short closing and long closing line .

Do not works such a good as I would be, but give some sound. If somebody can help me to ignore the double sound alert, would be great.

the Heiken Ashi vs Synergy APB (Average Price Bars)

im a big fan of HA and i was also wondering before months ago  what was the difference between both Synergy APB and HA, i did some  comparisons by putting HA's both Methods & Periods all at "1" and it  was very close but not exactly what the Average price bars was showing,  my conclusion is SYNERGY APB which is based on HA are a bit more  accurate than HA, because it's calculated a bit differently (see below)

hope this clarifies the differences between those 2, but now they are both my favorites

BTW ... keep up the good work Mihailo your Strategy is Good and it's NICE to see people helping others.

nice, but before you waste your time on re-inventing the wheel take a look at the attached indi...

you seem to be a good programmer, maybe you can help me with this: I would like to have the possibility to manually enter a text (size and textcolour should be adjustable) like"5 PIP Box" or "10 Tick Bars" behind the headerline(symbol,open,high,low,close)of the chart. charts are always changing and that is a place where it could stay without hiding anything. is that possible? or do you have to fix it to a corner?

and something offtopic: are you hungarian?

hey if your talking about the line across the screen, then that is just the buy order and take profit at the top. you can do this by dropping and dragging a closed trade from history onto the chart itself.

hope that helps

may i ask: are those "chart12.chr"/"chart13.chr"/... the offline chart?

if reduce those charts during installation, maybe it'd speed-up the loading process when login with the selected profile? I think later can add back by:

1) close MT4

2) add *.chr

3) restart MT4?

Anyone here trading the Mihailo System ? Actually still looking good,no?

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
I used to trade Renko some years ago

2 things you should know about it: it requires a lot of screen time during trending days you can make a lot of pips,in ranging days your equity will suffer,so a good MM is mandatory just a suggestion: apply 2 different Renko block size to the same pair,you will see the major trend easily

good luck

--- 帖子 #1403 ---
Hi swissfx,

thanks for your advise.

Please explain why do we need "a lot of screen time".

And then, could not be possible to code any EA to do most dirty job?  [ I mean, could you write down for us the rules (preset conditions/filters/order trigger event) to code the EA ]

--- 帖子 #1404 ---
Thanks Swissforex !

I'm learning forex since 2 years, and I appreciate you took the time to answer as I'm very new to Renko.

I do believe that it's a great tool as it's all about PA,and even after 2 years, I can't stop learning!

By the way, you're gonna have a new huge fan on your blog !

The naming of your currency pairs is slightly different from the template.

Go to the window showing the currency pairs on the left hand side of your MT4 screen, click on the same currency pair (as per your chart)and drag it on to the chart.

Repeat the same for the other charts.

Anybody still trading this system?  I just finished reading through the entire thread and the last 3-4 pages really fell off.  I have traded it today, and found it to be just like THV but with Renko.  I traded THV before and since have liked using Renko. So it was nice finding a system that combined both.

Anyway, if there are people still trading this sytem, then let us start posting our trades and bringing this thread back alive.

All credits to the developer of this amazing system! It is not only one of the very best systems it is already the best system at all. If you are a friend of the Renko Charts and you know how to deal with it, then you know what I'm talking about! Mihailo has created a powerful tool, it's up to each and everyone of us to use it the right way and to make it much profitable. I came along this thread in May and after reading the posts I decided to give it a try because it has sound much good to me. After some small modifications I started on May 22 and here are the results!

Hence I am wondering how it comes that you guys are not able to rebuild a template?  You can see my chart and the indicators I am using for it. Now for you guys a bit more in detail!

Less indicators for a better performance of the mt4. I'm watching 4 pairs!

The only thing what's different form Mihailo's original Renko Thv 5! is the Coral indicator. I'm using it as an unicolour average price level indicator. For your better understanding I show another chart. A small but very subtle distinction!

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
On Monday, 10/06/2013, no trades were made. The decision for this was due to the very strong up trend in the EJ & UJ and EU & GU (the pairs I am watching) had run into a range! For me I saw EJ and UJ on the limit already, but then has risen again before it went off into the range.

Surely, on the basis of hindsight view from EJ and UJ one still could buy, but for me personally afflicted with too much risk. The two also hang in the range now, but I am confident that this will change during the day and keep a lookout for shorties.

And then we are already at the greatest disadvantage of this system. If a pair runs in a range, you have almost no chance to get a decent setup.

Nevertheless, no need to bury one's head in the sand after such a day, because most trades have been made in the second half of the week. Therefore I can only recommend, not only to focus on one pair, even your account has not tens of thousands of euros or dollars!

There will be always such days and they will go again, so don't lose patience!

Greetings all

Looking at all the screen shots I am wondering why all the extra indicators. Isn't the point of using Renko to use Renko.

--- 帖子 #1429 ---
1st you have to identify that's a range! Then draw a line on the high and the low of the range and wait till the break out. You can enter directly on break out but I suggest to wait on the pull back.

Hi nasap thank you for replying with your results.  Do you follow all of Mihailo's original rules that is:

For Long signal:

Chart goes BLUE

2. PA is above Coral

3. PA is above Cloud

4. All block indicators are BLUE for first time

5. PA on M2 chart is above Coral and directon is UP

6. PA is NOT close to any important S & R line

7. NO news in next 15 minutes at least.

and the opposite for short? Thank you

--- 帖子 #1435 ---
The rules given to us for the system by Mihailo is to make trading as simple as possible! It's definitely clear what to do. I follow this till rule no. 5. If I follow rule no. 6, I guess there are no trades at all because almost every some pips there is another line. I will give more notice if S/R line is in accordance with round numbers, pivot or fibo levels on daily base.

I wanna show you 2 charts. For me personally the most secure trades because I have the lines in the back!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

And now I'll show you another good example I completly ignored the daily pivot line and the question is: who told you the price will stop moving on that line???

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

For rule no. 7 counts to stay away if news are rated medium or high on the economic calendar I am using for my trading.

Finally I can say it's like driving a car. It's a routine and you have to follow the traffic rules. But there are always some unexpected situations. You must solve it well not to get in trouble!

--- 帖子 #1436 ---
Thank you for providing the additional clarification.  One last question if you don't mind..  Mihailo's manual recommends 15-20 pips for TP and 50 for SL, but I see your TPs vary from 25-35?  Is this just from experience or is there some formula use?  Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
Thanks,thanks a lot for Your teaching . Your charts are very useful

AUDJPY   = 35

NZDJPY  = 35

Until now it works pretty good with this settings. So I am not focused to fetch all possible Pips of a move. Just some crumbs of the big cake is enough for me!

hello  nasap  iam   seeing  your  good  works,  keep   it  up.  pls  how   do  you  set   your  sl   cause  iam  trading  this  system  but  my  problem  is  where  to  place   stop  loss  and  i  have   been  struggling  with  this.

--- 帖子 #1440 ---
Ok, I was searching for a nice chart to explain a bit better. My initial S/L is 50 Pip also by default. But this is mentally only! You will never use a full S/L of 50 Pip. Why? Because you will get clear opposite signal long time before your initial S/L is triggered.

Let me explain by the chart. You sell on A with TP of 25 Pip on the blue line. The initial S/L is 50 Pip, the thick red line. Not later than at B you have a very clear buy signal. You will close your trade at this point with a S/L of 7 Pip plus spread.

nasap do you use the renko EA provided on post1?

Seems to kill my MT4 somehow...freezing all the time every 20 secs

--- 帖子 #1442 ---
nevermind...was the goldchart. some problem there

--- 帖子 #1443 ---
However, the reason for crashing or freezing your MT might be the renko EA and the 5 SignalE indicator. I don't use them! For the renko I use RenkoLiveChart_v3.2 instead and for this I need two M1 Charts for each pair.

Hello Nasap,

I am pretty much using the same setup as you do however I have a question. Don't you have any problems with the repainting of the OSMA/MACD? For example it only turned red on my screen after three additional bars appeared (painting all three of them red now) making it too late for me to join in as the price went up after that. Or would this be a lag issue because of the EA renko I use instead of the 3.2? (I will try that instead, see if it helps).

Also if all blocks are red, PA under coral, and PA below cloud do you wait for a full block to get under the cloud or step in immediately?

I am still trying to work out the right places to get in but sometimes after a single block the price explodes and rises 3/4 blocks. And another time you wait a for moments and in that short period there are suddenly  7 or 8 blocks under 30 seconds and I wonder if I am too careful or stepping in too late? (damn you GBPUSD).

That said so far your tips have helped me getting some pips.

Thanks in advance,

Satex

Hi nasap, I have been demoing this, and it has been working great.  Question I have for you is why do you need two M1s?  I only see the M1 with the RenkoEA, a M2 with the coral and M3 chart with all the indies.  Also, what did you observe that made you drop some of the original indies such as: MFI,T3,Flat, and EasyRider?  Thanks again for all your examples, they are worth a thousand words, and help tremendously in learning.

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
Hello. My mt4 do not wanna load this, its stuck -_-

--- 帖子 #1448 ---
please can you attach the latest template and indicators you're using

--- 帖子 #1449 ---
This might be the problem but not sure about it. Some others report the same problem, while I have only on strong upcoming PA.

It depends on the chart! If I can recognize some nice highs or lows, an A-B-C-Formation or a Fibo Retracement that I can draw a trendline, I configure it for the TrendLine EA. After all is done I sit back and wait.   Thats why I prefer to trade with the Trendline EA.

This EA you can download >>here<<  Scroll down to the download section and watch the video that you know how to use it!

regards nasap

--- 帖子 #1450 ---
Because I do not use the RenkoLiveChart_v3.3 EA, but the v3.2 instead! This older EA needs a M1 chart for every offline chart. But imho its not using resources that much.

I do not need them for my trading and in some cases they kept me from entering a trade even.

--- 帖子 #1453 ---
I'm already testing a new layout / setup. But the most disadvantage again, too much hungry!  My solution for this, working with profiles. One profile with 3 pairs and the other with 2 pairs.

Why? I found out that the Trix indicator is not a useful one. I replaced it with 3 indicators of the #pallada system. The big plus is the very clear entry signal and to filter the ranges. Still testing but the preliminary version I wanna show you already.

Hi nasap,

Interesting stuff you have there. Could you please share the indicators, ie. Pallada, you have on your chart please? I'd like to give it a whirl myself. Thanks very much.

--- 帖子 #1455 ---
Since the #Pallada System is a paid version, I cannot share the indis. What I find out is there are some !!!free!!! versions available. I dont know about that indis and if they will work. Just do some research with the search engine of your trust. Sorry!

Hello guys, as an expert of trading the renko charts you know, never use it without an overview on other time frames / charts. For this you can use the higher time frames like H1 or H4 with lots of indicators again, but this might slow down your system. How you can solve the little problem? Create a dashboard like the one on the picture. Open a new chart with your preferred currency and drag and drop the MetaWatcher indicator on the chart. Open the properties of the indicator and type in the names of the pairs you want it to display.

How you can benefit from a dashboard like MetaWatcher? I wil show you an illustration of a Trade. The signal for sell is given some time ago already. From time to time check the dashboard and actually it looks pretty good.

Configure the LineTrader EA for the entry or just open the Trade on one of the next possible bars.

Watch the dashboard periodically especially if trend stucks. But it looks pretty good that it will trigger TP.

My advice for you is to check the history folder 1st. There might be some files too big already. 2nd delete the *.log files in sub directory "logs" of metatrader and experts. For this you must close your metatrader and after deleting the *.log files you start it again.

Hope this works for you.

Hi,

Nasap.

I really appreciate your screenshots and the table you have posted here. Please help with a few of my doubts.

1. I understand the entry, but serious question is how to exit.I know perfectly where to place the stops as soon as I enter.

2.The pairs you have trading, has all these been tested.

3. No matter you buy a Rolex watch or a roadside watch, the time will show the same.

Please do not get me wrong for making this statement.I want to know if we can apply the same strategy for CFD's and metals as well?

I have downloaded the files but unable to set the ea running, it does not trade... Is it automated or not?

Please reply, I am eagerly waiting for your valuable reply.

Regards,

Ravi

--- 帖子 #1466 ---
The EA is to feed the M2 and M3 offline charts it does not actually do the trades for you, you have to do that manually

--- 帖子 #1467 ---
1. I am working with fixed tp for all pairs and shorten sl in some cases

2. they are correlated to each other

3. What's the question?

I can't tell you when you have to realize the tp, you have to find out what fits you the best. If you already know how you must set sl, the only answer is take your profit in time, don't let it go again! Imho you can use the setup for anything to trade your broker offers. If you have questions about CFDs and metals, just ask the people deal in CFDs and metals.

What ea you are talking about? There is one ea only, the RenkoLiveChart ea and it is not an automated system at all. You kindly start reading on first page!

hello nasap, is this #pallada_vqi indicator a repainting indicator (repainting more than just the actual bar) ?

--- 帖子 #1473 ---
Let me explain by a chart again. The renko bar was opened at 5:59 am and the close was at 6:19 am. Since I'm living in a different timezone of my broker, add 12 hours. The first significant bar for a signal will have a dot on, below or above it. As long as this bar is not confirmed it might repaint again and this is absolutely correct! If once the bar has been confirmed, there is an alert and a signal is send by email. This #pallada vqi indicator for me is one of the very best indicators and a very reliable one. The only mistake is the "Wrong TimeFrame" message because it has been designed for the "normal" time frames. But who cares about?  The main thing it works!

You must adjust it that you can benefit from Renko Thv 5! It's not only the brick size, the coral and other indicators also must be adjusted.

Good Day

Sorry for the late reply sir. I am sending the screenshot of crude oil I am trading on.

I can't suggest the semafor indicator! It's one of the most terrible repainter at all. When it sets a low or a high, but trend still continues, it moves on and on and on! I'm a burnt child already!

I'd really like to try this, just for fun.

But the intitial setup of Mihailo crashes my MT4 everytime

--- 帖子 #1488 ---
It did my system as well.  Two things I found to help:

1. Don't have so many charts open at one time.  For example, I installed a second MT4 program and then had 2 charts open in one, and 2 open in the other.  This helped.

2. Change the number of bars in chart in the settings of the MT4.

Hope that helps you as it helped me.

.I now realize why you have the renko m2 charts along with it. But still, while taking the entry, it is fearing sir, as because the VQI indicator repaints.

Im new with Renko THV but it isnt so hard. Follow the basic rules and its done..

VQI is the helpers helper and gives you a rough direction and emails you about a possible entry..

It does not matter if he repaints or not. Again, its only a hint. Coral is the Master..

The important part is the Red/Blue quadripartite and if the PA is below/above Coral, direction and a look at M2, M3 aso..

The rules are so simply..

Thanks for your statment and you are absolutely right!

these indicators available for Ninja trader?

--- 帖子 #1507 ---
Just for info the VQ do not repaint after the candle is closed. All indicators repaint until the candle will be closed.
I have tested this indicator for several weeks and I have never seen it repaint (change colour after the candle is closed).

rgrds

Kristjan

--- 帖子 #1508 ---
In this case the VQ is a MTF indicator (it is set to take value from M30 )so it can repaint for several time in lower tf or renko charts until bar in M30 will close. This is the same like with every other MTF indicator.

--- 帖子 #1509 ---
No it no t a MTF since I am running it on 1 min tf and also on Renko chart and in the setting the Timframe is set to "0" so it reflects the current TF.

rgrds

Kristjan

--- 帖子 #1510 ---
If you use it like this then it will no repaint after bar is close, but if you use nasap recomanded settings where VQI is on m30 in that case it can repaint.

--- 帖子 #1511 ---
Then yes if use it on 1 min tf then it can repaint it up to 30 bars. That is the logic behind MTF indicators

Hi Nasap,

I am amazed with your consistent result using this system. Trying it now. If you don't mind, on the first trade you posted for UJ, why did you take it after some bars while all bars were blue, above coral and cloud, matrix tools also all blue? Why didn't you take it earlier about the first time it cross coral with confirmed condition from indicators?

thank you,

-dc-

--- 帖子 #1517 ---
I guess you mean this entry. Let me explain! The green trend line above the entry was drawn first like the blue dotted one and activated for the LineTrader. Excellent calculated, because PA will break through Coral in M2 at this level! A good entry above the FPV. I cannot enter in that trade earlier since PA is still below Coral in M2!

--- 帖子 #1518 ---
Hi Nasap,

thank you for your explanation. One question leads to another. Do you draw the line purely because of the price action trend line or do you have any algorithm to calculate the value of coral in M2?

regards,

-dc-

--- 帖子 #1519 ---
There is no algorithm! Just have a look on the original M2 chart not the Stratman Mini Chart! I'm always looking for some kind of pattern or up / down trend channels. For me the very best way of trading. This is how my M2 chart looks like. The lines are from Gann Fan Indicator. Also a good way to recognize SR - levels.

You are welcome!

The New Renko Thv 5! is already what you see. We don't use all the indicators like before, since there is no need for all of them. Your MM you have to calculate by the pairs you want to deal with. If you have 5 pairs to trade and your risk will be 1% per Trade so your total risk should be 5%. Otherwise you can not trade 5 pairs the same time. It depends on you only. Just make it that you still feel comfortable with it!

For my trading I use the LineTrader EA and I take ad hoc decision as well. And my Broker is OANDA [JOKE ON]one of the most reliable and customer oriented[JOKE OFF] in this business.

I am reading the thread now, and had hoped to have completely read it before I asked any questions.  However, I am only on page 30 so far, and wanted to get a clarification before I started setting up the system.

Mahailo,

You had mentioned in the first part of the thread that you recommended setting up Metatrader on a separate partition.  How big a partition should I create for it?  also, since some people were saying it was crashing their system, but not yours, I was wondering what processor speed and ram you had running on your system?

Thanks and great system.  Looking forward to catching up on the thread.

Thanks nasap.  Is Mihailo no longer posting to this thread?

"Continue reading on page 74!

"I read page 74, but didn't understand what I was supposed to get out of it?

Also, I meant to ask one more question...This system is based on the THV system?  I was wondering if you could point me to the main THV thread so I can better understand the original system that this was derived from.

It seems he left! However I hope he's doing well.

You stop on page 30 and you will continue from page 74 until the end. Otherwise you will read the same questions and answers again and again and again!

Maybe it's this thread you are looking for: THV system, final edition

Hello nasap.

Can you please share your indi/script/EA for the chart M2 GannFan because i try mine and don't work?

Thanks nasap.  I will continue the thread from page 74 and start the THV tread.

Suggestion.

Im a self called THV 4 'expert'. Love it. But.. You dont need to read the whole THV 4 thread to succeed Renko THV5.

The most common thing these two systems have is Patience. And the Heikin Ashis.

And of course, Mother Coral..

Especially if you look at the Nasaps charts. No Trix? anymore..

You have to follow the rules, have a market insight and Patience and all will be fine.

But it also does not hurt if you read the THV4 thread. Solves a lot of questions about Pivots, market behavior aso..

And you can see, how other people trade.. And how a lot of people dont have a clue but want to make money fast and without diligence..

And them disappear after a while..

Interesting that you are referring us to Forex Master Method site.  What part of that page do we need to study, or all we supposed to read all of it and watch all of the videos?  Also, is this method, formerly Mihailo's and now Nasap's like FMM, or derived from it?

Hi, its again me.

Blah..

Every time i visit the thread here, its only Nasap who posts charts

and all other search.., want something or dream about signals, more indicators or Eas.

Why dont you simply trade the system.. ??

Lazy folk !!!!

--- 帖子 #1555 ---
Toranga,

I would have no problem trading the original system, however nasap is the only one trading and posting right now.  It follows that for those of us who have just discovered this thread, we will move toward the system that is currently being used because that is our only source of feedback.

If you have any other ideas that would help us newbies here, I would love to hear them.

Stephen

--- 帖子 #1556 ---
Hi, thanks for answering. Even if it sounds different, im in a good mood.. butt..

"I would have no problem trading the original system, however nasap is the only one trading and posting right now."

So we are at the same opinion.. (?) Why dont you setup the system and post some trades.

And ask some intelligent questions, that would brings us all further.. Maybe you will discover something new..

You are a member here since 2008 (longer than me) and have 7 posts ?? Whats the problem ??

"we will move toward the system"

When ?? Next Christmas ??  Or next next ?? he he

"If you have any other ideas that would help us newbies here, I would love to hear them."

If you dont write your problems, i cant answer..

I have 5 or more thousand hours of screen time and really hate it when people want to be spoon fed

without doing some effort.. The hours i wasted in front of the PC will never come back, so why to make it for the others so easy..

Quote "please could you post the template"
NO, it isnt so hard..

Do it by yourself, and if you have problems, ASK, you will be helped..

Every time i read a EA or Template wish from a newbie i become goose bums

ps. By the way, i also discovered this thread 1 month ago. The only reason i dont post here,

is because i post somewhere else, plus i dont want to spoon feed lazy people

My template works, (i spent 3 nights setup it) and i watch now 9 pairs and all is ok. It is not so hard..

Just do it..

** he he, wer bin ich wohl. I sag nur. Hab gesagt das ich NIE posten werde

Die gehen mir so auf den Sack fast alle..

--- 帖子 #1557 ---
Toranaga,

Let's level set here, shall we...

I found this thread a week ago.  I had read thru from page 1 to page 30, and posted a question about partition size as Mihailo had suggested to load the MT4 programs on a separate partition.  I was at that time that nasap informed me that Mihailo was no longer on the thread, and that I should skip forward to page 74, which I did.  I am now only almost caught up to page 81.  After starting the thread from page 74 I realized that what nasap was trading was slightly different from what Mihailo had first set up.  I have not asked templates to be posted, as I look at anything some one is willing to post as a gift.  I only asked for help about the padalla indicator after trying to download it myself.  I have since caught up to the post where nasap set up the indicator file, so the post I made a few hours ago is no longer relevant.

Yes, I was surprised to learn I was a member here in 2008.  Between then and now I have done no forex trading or any other trading.  I only recently decided to look at it again with a new attitude and new goals.  I am sure I joined before because it had something to do with EA robots.  I am now trying to learn how to trade manually.

I have purchased Cynthia Macy's system, and although I think it is a good system, it is not working for me.  What led me to this thread was a search about Renko charts.  I started reading it and got interested.

I am certainly not lazy, and have been trying to play catch up so if I do have to ask questions, they aren't stupid ones or ones that already had been asked.  I am certainly not asking to be spoon fed, and am putting in the effort to come up to speed.  Needless to say, I take offense at your accusations.  However, I'm not going to loose sleep over it.  I have been on reef tank fourms, gun forums, scale modeling forums, and forex forums, and all have people like yourself that like to step into the middle of the thread and put down other members of the thread.  I too, get irritated when I see people ask questions that have already been answered, and ask for things they can do themselves.  That was the very reason why when I found the thread I started it from page 1.

I agree with you about asking for the templates, (although the template does make everything easier and makes sure the chart looks like it is supposed to-but I didn't ask nasap for it) but I am certainly not asking to be spoon fed and resent the acquisation that I am.

Stephen

--- 帖子 #1558 ---
nasap, before I get distracted on the silly stuff, just wanted to thank you for what you are doing here.  I am now finally caught up and will soon start to try to load everything up and then start trading on demo.  I really like how you report your results each week.  It helps us to know that someone (you) are really doing well and what can be achieved.

Du hast 100% recht. Ich gehöre auch zu die Leute die auf diese Forum bishier nichts beigetragen haben. Deshalb:

I trade renko charts as well and have followed this system for a while. I trade a different but similar system – my own. I would only add that it’s very rare for someone to post their own system and then have others trade it even if it’s really good. Sometimes it works for a while but sooner or later it fails. A lot goes back to the time it takes to develop and understand a system. By just downloading it, you do not really get all the nuances and have not done your apprenticeship. No pain – no gain.  Sorry if this makes many newbies unhappy but this is not an easy business. Quite the reverse.

--- 帖子 #1563 ---
Yes, nasap, I saw this.  When I made the comment about the download problems I hadn't gotten to that point in the thread yet.  Sorry for not waiting :-)

I found a programmer in Poland that will do for me EA with simple rules:

1. long when all lights are blue for the first time since the "n" candles

2. price is above the "coral"

3. freescalping indicator (or pallada vqi) is yellow (pallada - blue)

(analogous sell)

For entry I only use renko candles (not HA)

I set TP and SL with daily pivots.

For backtest I use TP=10 and SL=10 and we will see what comes up.

Hello everyone and hi nasap,

i'm using your system from about a week and i really like it. On Friday i made my first trade on EURJPY and i won 25 pips.

I've got a question about your trades from past week, and i'm speaking about one of your first trades on NZDJPY. First buy trade was opened after crossing SB DONE line, but what i'm curios about is why didn't you close your trade about 19:14 after appearing of signal SELL.

I'm thinking about 3 ways:

1. Secound candle after candle which crossed Coral line was opened on buy.

2. There wasn't any signal on M2

3.And this one may seem a little even too (!) curios but i saw that you had opened H1 timeframes and if this is possible can you tell me if you were using them for your trade? I mean for checking if this is going to be a good trade. Maybe you saw something on H1, like SELL signal or something.

I'm writing about this closing because you told us that this was some kind of situation when you should close your position (i think that you told us this), and my question is: why didn't you close your trade after seeing this specific kind of situation.

P.S.

I see that you're using some kind of AutoFibo, could you please provide a download link for this indicatior...?

Best regardes Vimes123

--- 帖子 #1578 ---
Set the parameters for the #Pallada VQI and the 4 block indicators to something  like this. It works for me!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1579 ---
Candle did not close below the 61,8% Fibo Level. Trading the Fibo Levels is one of my preferred styles. The H1 has no importance for the Renko Thv 5! System! It's just another very simple system.

I don't use any other indicators than the ones I shared already or included in your Metatrader. There is no special AutoFibo or whatever!

--- 帖子 #1580 ---
Hey Nasap,

so you are using 1% of your account on 50 pips emergency SL if I understand good?

and VQ on all pairs are 12?

I tried this system long ago but only few days because was trading with another system.Think it is good time to start over again,it has good potential and i like renko as well.

Keep up a good work Nasap

--- 帖子 #1599 ---
Hello All

I am new to this thread, read all the posts, set up my charts, everything is looking good ( well, most everything, to be honest ) even solved the mt4 freezing bug as I use a different RENKO EA and this EA allows me to select how many bars in history to use, I set it very low ( 7,000 ) and this gives me an offline chart with only about 400 renko bars and this solved the problem with freezing so I am guessing with others it might have been due to too large a renko chart.

In case anyone wants to give it a try, just do a search for the s-renko bars EA  ( I can't post it as it is a commercial script and it came with a system I bought from NetPicks ) but I also found available at forexfactory at this link

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...02#post2999102

Just keep in mind I haven't tested or looked at this file above as I am using the one that I bought, but you are looking for the input parameter called "maxbars" and just set it to 7000 for the M3 off line chart ( box size is 5 pip ) and for the M2 chart where the box size is 13 pips, set the maxbars setting to 14,000.   This helps keep your offline renko charts small and should prevent your mt4 platform from freezing.

Anyways, I do have a quick question for Nasap.  I have played with the Ichimoku settings and my chart resembles yours, but not exactly.  I have posted a pic of the settings that I am currently using, but could you let me know which settings you are using

And one last question, why do you have it follow the price action so closely as it rarely filters or delays the entry at these settings

--- 帖子 #1600 ---
Hi Nasap

Very cool system. Many thanks for all your work. One question which you may already have answered somehwere but I can't see the answer anywhere. What are the green lines entitled SB  Done and SB1 Done. Are they support lines? Using what criteria? Many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #1601 ---
Thats part of Linetrader. A EA that enter trades based on trend lines you draw.

--- 帖子 #1602 ---
Hello. First of all I want to congratulate to the thread starter Michailo (although he seems to have long disappeared), and even more to Nasap who seems to have brought it back to life in a more than brilliant way. I used to trade renko a couple of years ago but with no consistant results due to the "repainting" nature of these bars. I would be glad to give it a shot again after looking at what nasap has been capable of achieving.

I built up my own template but I'm experiencing an unusual problem with the Stratman indi, that I didn't see reported before. I've opened a new demo with icmarkets, I've built up my own template and that's what I get on the m3 chart by setting stratman to m2 (i.e. no bars)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Then if set it to m3 I get this, i.e. i do see bars
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Then if I set the indi back to m2 I see this (which matches the indi I have on the m2 chart)
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Then if I restart MT4 I'm back to square one i.e. no bars displayed.

Any suggestion?

--- 帖子 #1603 ---
Thanks Toranaga. I have looked at the attachments in this thread and could not find it. I am not the most computer literate person so would you be so kind as to post it again or a link as to where I might find it. Recht herzlichen Dank.

Zoog, here is the link to the Linetrader EA (about half way down the page).  There is also a video on how to use it and one on installing it there with the EA.

Sorry for this newbie question, but I'm seeing the terms "VQ" (possibly in relation to the Pallada EA?) and "FPV".  Could someone tell me what they mean?

Stephen

--- 帖子 #1606 ---
Oh, meant to ask in the last post.  Has anyone found any use for the other EA's and indicators posted on the Forex Master Method site?

Stephen

--- 帖子 #1607 ---
Well, finally a further question..

"FPV" = Fibonacci Pivot Point.

There are usual Pivots and the Fibonacci one..

You have to check the Tz Pivots a lot to gain all the advantages from it..

Well written..

I like both, but work with the FPV..

http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibBio.html#

and of course..

Even if i fade out, i think that had to be posted.

Fibonacci is so cool.

Have in mind, he lived almost 800 years ago and discovered something that is useful now more than ever..

--- 帖子 #1608 ---
Btw. remembered,

and had a quick search.. What a insider joke, (he he) but

i really dont believe in that is a coincidence..

(And if pigeons respect that, unaware..)

--- 帖子 #1609 ---
Toranaga,

Thanks for the info.  I really like the pigeons:-)  I too am a big fan, however know very little about the Fibs at this point.  I am always amazed, though, with how many times you see prices bounce off Fibonacci levels.  Part of my longer term education will involve some courses on Fibonacci that Cynthia Macy recommends (not hers, but another person she thinks highly of).

I guess the next question is are these levels already part of the download package, or do we need to get them elsewhere?  The system I bought from Cynthia Macy has Fib lines in it, but I don't know if they are Fib Pivot Points or not.

Also, do you know what "VQ" references?

Stephen

SHE is not honest at all!!! . Her unique color coded system is a system developed a while back called the HAMA system. The buy/sell signals are from the Original Black dog trading system the no trade crosses were added to that system later.

For someone who is a professional trader her site sure doesn't look like she makes money trading.

I'm certainly not the expert on this, but I have the system, and there is nothing like the HAMA indicators like you have on the attached chart.  They may be the same or similar (just different names being used), but from the chart they don't appear that way to me. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I don't really want to argue about it I dont really care if she is selling others ideas anyway. I was just trying to save some people some money  The picture you posted looks nothing like what she showed and that looks like a Bollinger band stop.

Anyway it is what it is good luck to her.

Does anyone know where I can find an indicator called tumbler its gone commercial it used to be free.  attached is a screen shot I had the indicator from another forum but its been removed I don't have the ex file anymore so it wont compile because I was not original author. Any help would be appreciated.

I attached a screen shot

--- 帖子 #1617 ---
Hey Stephen are you shilling for her. She is selling a Renko indicator the chick is a fraud check out her new "INTRO III" easy break out system its. And compare to the screen shot I posted here Its really FX Pries I think mods should remove the link to her site or move it to commercial this thread gets huge traffic I would say fine but come on she is selling a Renko system

REALLY???? And she has been so nice to you talking you out of systems you are spamming man!!!!

--- 帖子 #1618 ---
No kickme, I am not shilling or spamming for her.  It was the renko chart she sales from another vendor on her site that actually brought me here.  I bought the renko system there, but felt there wasn't much documentation and started googling renko and found this thread.  As I have said previously, I felt hers was a good system (understanding I am very new to this - prior experience was several years ago and only messing with robots, not trying to trade manually) but have said at least twice here it wasn't working for me.  I am not trying to sell her products, but I can't stand it when people start attacking some one with no experience of their own.  She was good and fair to me, however I can't trade her system, so I started looking elsewhere.  That doesn't mean I think she did anything dishonest and will defend her based on MY experience with her.

Toranaga said he had never heard of her.  I included the URLs in case he was interested.  Nothing more.

Hopefully this puts an end to the issue.

It's getting to the point I can't come on this site without getting attacked by some one.  I've never seen a bunch more ready to jump on some one else for what they ASSUME...

I'm done.

--- 帖子 #1619 ---
I'm done.

He he, relax. I can show you some other sites where that is only kindergarten..

Thats a part of the game if you try to play with money to make money.. and be on Forums...

Both of you have right. But..

Lets focus again on Renkos and here..

3. Pa was under pivot and have enought room to next pivot

4. everything line up on M3

Hi Nasap,

I have a problem. At my graphs everthing are ok; but a little time later Pallada VQ1 indicator is become crashed.

Then I open indicators list; get into Pallada indicator's properties; without anh change; it begins to work properly.

Sorry my bad English; I need your help  My Pallada properties and crash situation's screenshots  like this.

Another picture perfect entry, IMO, at yellow line for 20 pips. Early exit at R1 due to GBP news.

--- 帖子 #1633 ---
What is your Metatrader build no? Click on Help / About and read build no at the bottom left corner. Mine is 509 and indi is working fine. If you are using previous versions, then you can try to update your Meta.

Regards,

Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #1634 ---
Or more radical solution. You don't need that indi because with current suggested settings, this indi almost always gives early signal than 4-block signals meaning when you have a valid signal (everthing lines up), Pallada already gives a go at least a few bars before. So basically, you won't need it.

Blackeagle

Something isn't correct with VQ looking different than mine Blackeagle,

Hi Blackeagle,

My Metatrader Build No: 509

Firstly Pallado indi. works fine but after a little time it becomes crashed; then I get into indi.'s properties; without any change it begins working properly.

Regards,

Barış

--- 帖子 #1641 ---
Give it another try by opening a new M1 chart and then offline M2 and M3 but this time do not use any other indicators such as AO or RSI that I see on your screenshot. You won't need those to trade this system. If this does not work, then do not use Pallado. Because lining up of all 4 indis is lagging compared to Pallada, so you won't need Pallada's confirmation.

Hope this helps,

Regards,

Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #1642 ---
I think you're right.

Before I attached indicators like AO or RSI, Pallado was working properly.

I'll remove these indicators and use the system like you.

As i can see, you have too less M2 data for a Coral calculation.

Wait 2 Weeks or generate deeper M2 offline chart data and the Coral will match up.

And DAMNED, if you have  a problem with Ichi why dont you post the Ichi parameters instead of

?? 4 ?

It has so look like this

Stratman minichart indi brings M2 chart onto M3 to be able to trade this system by using M3 only. And M2 is created by by RenkoLiveChart EA. Default settings on this EA show that M2 renko box size is 13 as suggested by Mihailo, and Nasap is recommending to use this default setting. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1661 ---
No idea why your VQ chart looks different than everyone else. Maybe you can try Oanda MT4 or another company's MT4 and reinstall all indis to see if there will be a difference. If not, get rid of that indi if you are going to use 4-indi block for your signals.

Hello Guys,

I would like to use the flat indicator from Mihailo's original system, however I found that for some reason the lines which has to be red are always black. Is there anybody who still use this indicator without a problem? I tried it under win xp and win 2012 with the latest mt4 build 509.

Thanks.

Hi  Zokynho  i  believe  the  problem   is  from  the  old  version  of  the  renkochart  3.3  or  3.2  that  mahailo  put  in  the  folder,  cause i have  used  them  before  and  i  dont  like   them  because   it  either  freezes  my   chart  or  system   or  it  make  the  chart  look  very  choopy.  but  now  iam  using  median  renkochart,  it make  the  chart   look  appealing,  it  smoothes  the  indicators  and  very  sensitive  and  fast.  i  will  love  to  share  it  with  you  but  first  i  have  to  upload  my  chart  for  you to  see  it.  but  my  problem  is  how  to  upload  the  chart  in  this  thread  cause  iam  still  learning  ing  computer.

Do you have free version of it or paid version?

@maechilin,

Thanks for your reply, I found the problem. There was a million message in the log file about mt4 cannot open the coral.ex4. Which is no wonder, because i didn't put it in the indicator folder. I didn't know that flat indicator uses it.

Hi  maccanz, here  is   the  indicator

--- 帖子 #1696 ---
ok I have hesitated to post this till I could be sure that it was not me. The indicator plots different values on the HA depending on the platform you are on. Is there a patch for this The attached screen shots are for alpari an fxdd the results were even worse for oanda and fxcm . I have been watching it for over 3 weeks. On the oanda platform it will repaint and then repaint back to the original depending on the volatility of the market..

comments ideas

--- 帖子 #1697 ---
Ok so I had originally asked a question as to if the system is still being traded on the explorer account and if so it has not shown a profit in a very long time. I like the idea of Renko charting because it keeps it simple but in doing research have heard that it can be sporadic on meta trader I posted the 2 screen shots form fxdd and alpari and in this post is the same time frame settings etc for oanda.

Its completely different!!!!

Is there a bug that needs to be fixed is this just an apparition or is it the norm.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1698 ---
Unless you have checked to see that there is no holes in any of the data for both companies, then you are bound to have different charts as the data is definitely going to be different.. There are often gaps in the data from metatrader..... and each broker will have different gaps...

You may have to consider using dukas or tickstory to get better data, then you can make comparisons

--- 帖子 #1699 ---
Not really sure what you mean by that I have to trade off the data of my broker. How do you check the data? I am not trying to cut on this system rather make sure that I have everything correct?

In doing some additional research outside this realm Renko can be sporadic in its plotting because of the variance in spreads which can be magnified in times of low liquidity if this is the case and there is a bug like that it makes sense that I would see the variance in charts on a Friday afternoon in the summer and perhaps we can work around it.

--- 帖子 #1700 ---
Metatrader 4 has poor data. many people know this to be true..

Check out Dukas and tickstory and make sure you have good data...

There are softwares that detect holes in data..

--- 帖子 #1701 ---
May I ask what is the other indicator in the pallada window? Thanks

--- 帖子 #1702 ---
Congrats may your winning ways continue.

Would it be at all possible for you to post the charts after you  take the trade so that others may try and duplicate your success and we can then see what we are missing. In the 2 months since I have started trading this the best I can do is a break even.

Hi friends,

thanks for the good ideas.

I carefully watched the charts, made a lot of sreenshots and noticed the '13' histograms redraw and redraw even after a bar is closed.

Only the 13 CCi is reliable when looking back in history.

I only saw 1 post about repainting ; the osma macd.

It seems nobody else has repainting issues?

thanks Talbot

--- 帖子 #1716 ---
No I had posted before about the repainting and the fact that candles are off depending on the broker you use. I checked my data as suggested and found it was fine. If you also look the HA bars are not limited to the size one specifies for example a 5 bar box can actually plot as high as a 20 pip box. This can in my view mess things up since stops may be hit using previous bars.

I am using a filter that will smooth the Renko and is supposed to take care of all that. I cant speak for the other indicators because I am not using those. It does seem to help however. As I understand it because many indicators use a look back in their algorithms Renko can mess them up because they are time based. This is what I was told in another forum by a programmer so if it is true or not I don't know. As with anything in forums ( except here in FF  ) take it all with a grain of salt

I attached a screen shot of the HA candle size I didn't want to ellipse every one of them but if you look the elipse bar is actually 22 pips not 5 which means essentially trading that candle on an open ( or reversal ) you would have missed out on 15 pips. and a 20 pips range is pretty big when you consider that most currencies average daily movement is only 100 pips that's 20% of the days move on 1 candle.

1st your calculation is wrong!

USDJPY => +22

EURJPY => +20

AUDJPY => -30

===========

Total ===> +8 (+12)

You gained 50% just by calculation!

Ok, let's talk about the facts! I am wondering where you saw a valid signal? On that point of your entry there is not even one of the block indicators in blue color! Why you didn't take the opportunity a bit more to the left (break of the dotted trend line)?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

But the main question is, why you bought at an impossible point? The answer is shown on the 2nd chart. Simply draw a Fibo from the low to the high and you easily can see that the 61.8% level of retracement was broken clearly! Broken means a Close below the 61.8% level. This is a absolutely NO GO, NO DEAL!

There can be scenarios like this do work, but what I find out that in most cases it does not!

Hope this will help for the future.

Since you know the indi is a repainter, why don't you wait on confirmation? Sometimes its a bit too much we are going to risk and therefore we will lose. For the fibo I explained how I'm trading it. It's up to you to keep it on your mind or to draw and trade whatever you want!

I have been using this system for the last three weeks in real time and have thirteen winning trades and five losing. I think that is perfectly OK (actually its great) I am hugely suspicious of any system that never loses - it does not exist. I see the blocks repaint but then as Nasap says you might want to try and get confirmation before opening a position. I have found that when the Stratman chart crosses the line and all else confirms that usually is a good time to take a trade. Not fool proof but better than 50/50 - so far anyway. I find it amusing when people look for ways to avoid losing trades. There is only one sure way - DON'T TRADE. You only need an edge to make money and I think what Nasap has given us gives us that edge. Good MM is however, as in all systems, essential.

Hi Nasap,

At your post no:1743 or no:1779 graghs, I saw some extra indi.s on Pallada indicator.

Can you share that, please?

Sorry for my bad English.

Second time..

I think he reads all posts carefully, and not answering means i think: NO

And i think im allowed to quote this..

--- 帖子 #1731 ---
That indi. seems so good for confirmation.

Because of this I wrote.

--- 帖子 #1732 ---
What indi are you talking about can you post picture I don't see any other indi on there

--- 帖子 #1733 ---
Too much all at once is overload... people have to work with things one at a time and grow with experience and experimentation to grasp what they need.. Overloading with someone else' ideas can lead to confusion and frustration and then failure...

It is very difficult to take someone's template and then try to trade the same way..... we each perceive things in a different way.

Thanks for sharing as much as you have....

I waited, but i have to ask now.. Sorry but your charts are

Congrats for the hits, but nothing to see, nothing to learn from it.

Renko bricks and few lines. Do you trade this way or what is this ??

Have a look how Nasap post it..

With his way you can evaluate what he done or how to do it.

Peace

--- 帖子 #1747 ---
Yes this is the way I trade it just the bricks ( the way you see it) only difference is I am trading a smoothed version of Renko. I guess I will move my posts to a journal thread since I also have gotten a few PMs saying essentially that I am spamming this thread.

Also a few have PM'd me about the hama bars indicator I posted. The indicators were not mine and I originally got them from another member ( calstar ) I don't have the key or any contact info for fxcruiser. I assume since he was on Zulu and RAS that he no longer offers that indicator commercially. Perhaps PM calstar. Sorry that they were not available for all to use.

Sorry if I offended any one with my posts

--- 帖子 #1748 ---
I found your posts very interesting. OK so they are not the same system as Nasap but so what? Please continue.

--- 帖子 #1749 ---
I realy would appreciate it if this is moved to a seperate thread. It has nothing to do with the original system of the Renko Thv 5!

Thank you for your respect and understanding!

regards nasap

--- 帖子 #1750 ---
made  +26 pips  from  this  though  just a  little from  the  whole.

--- 帖子 #1751 ---
While I guess since I am using a commercial version of the original Renko system and it smooth the candle so that it is an actual 5.10,20 pip box depending on the setting I  do believe that it is relevant.

When you trade this with HA candles the candles can be as much as 7-8 pips larger.  Add that to the spread and the loss on a bad trade is 7-8 pips greater Renko in itself is meant to make it easier to trade by eliminating the noise from a chart much the same way a KAGI and point and figure are suppose to.

I do not understand why you want me to move to another thread when you are not the thread starter but none the less I will do so.

Its a shame when people cant show success to others as it can be a very demoralizing business that we are all attempting. Sometimes a glimpse of success is all someone needs to say hey I can do this as well.

90 pips overnight on USD/JPY weeks total no sits at I think 442 pips last nights total was trading buy on blue sell on red always in the market

Good luck and good trading to all I am going to bed

Hallo jonjon,

what are the other two indis you have there on your chart.

can you kindly share with us.

or give a link on where to get them.

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #1781 ---
Hi ,

When I look at a "system" i need to understand the core principles its built around.

What I like about this here is that it reminds me of one i developed many years ago but i used range bars.

Further the way nasap trades it is exactly how the system i developed was traded.

It was not for mt4 however.

Key points for users is to understand why certain things are used. It will differ from different trading styles.

Hints:   what does the cloud here mimic ?

whats one of the best indis for renko ?

However, all indis are worthless if one can't read price action, market structure etc.

Thats trading not waiting at the traffic light...

anyway mine is nothing special . just fits the way i see things or understand with the little i know

answers to the 2 above will lead u to what i use.

But its always better to develop it for oneself so one knows the pros and cons of your trading decisions

all the very best

It is always well with my soul ...

PS....  actually what nasap has shown so far will teach you to trade successfully.

understand , see the trades nasap posts and u will understand.

Dont get too focused on the system or indis...  what is given is way more than enough

Instead  see and understand nasap's trades...    how , why , etc  ( am impressed)

one key nasap mentioned ....  it takes patience....     wait for the opportunity and wait for the TP levels

Very nice thread ...  thanks vm enjoyed it

--- 帖子 #1782 ---
Thanks for your reply.

BTW...what you wrote up there is a basic truth and am happy to inform you that myself and a lot of people here have known all this and we put it in practice.

but that doesn't mean we can not aspire for more ..aspire to be better than we are..(that is basically the evolution of man).

don't just stay in your comfort zone...look for ways to better your present state...or else one will just get rotten and left behind.

I for one..i don't follow the herd..i question every damn thing..i check and test and test...becos i am aiming for higher....it is only in this way you can get better.

at the same time i don't believe any human has monopoly of knowledge... we can always learn from each other....when i see something good ..either indicator or system..e.t.c.. i take it ..look at it ..question it.... modify it... and if it doesn't make me better..i Discard it and move on...if it makes me better..i hold it and use.

Even ...NASAP...(thanks to him) ...took some of the original thread...added something(s) to it and becomes better than the former...(and i believe he is still growing).

So having said that... Simply....i would have thought it could have been very very very great if after all you said ...you answered my question.

in the spirit of the thread and the Forum and humanity....things are shared here....or NOT!

Some post back i think Nasap mentioned to a member why he/she could'nt share an indi...simply becos it is a commercial one.

Sorry i need to stop here ..i don't generally  talk much on forums...due to certian reason.

Stay Blessed and more Successful Trades.

Cheers.

Hi,billv...

I tried your way, thanks .. now  i got Coral on my M2 chart (stratman mini)

on the 5th step of setting up Mihailo's Renko Thv, just as i create M3 chart (offline) ... i found a fact, that not all currency have the M3 chart

Any idea why?

--- 帖子 #1784 ---
I'm guessing that you didn't apply the expert advisor to the M1 chart of those currency pairs

or the DLL's were not enabled when you applied the expert

or the experts were not turn on.

Go to the M1 chart, right click on the chart, select expert advisor properties and see that the DLL's are enabled

Turn ON expert advisors and see if the M3 offline charts appear

Good day for everybody!!

Can someone please explain to me what i'm missing, as I see on some charts the arrows form opening and closing trades, but i don't get it when I trade ... can someone please clarify me about it?

While browsing through the thread I came up with your post. It is a bit different with respect to the indicators and the template.

Hi Mihailo!

Can you please clarify me about Your excellent trading system, if it generates automatic trades or implies manual trades.

Dear Thread,

I remember that other trader said that 'it takes patience in applying this strategy'

Observing the nature of this system ... i have to agree to another fact about this system, it takes a lot of 'screen time' (the reason why we have to patience)

My question is...

"is there any alert system we one can use to make it easier? (using this system)

The alert that telling us to be prepare...

I think i remember  NaSap said (he/she) is using #Pallada VQI's email alert

It may be best that you spend a lot of time learning to trade the system before trying to use alerts..... NaSap spent the hours required to master the system and then started to rely more on alerts and I am sure he does a thorough analysis before any entries.

Trading means chart time..... thousands of hours...!  There is no easy way.

can any one help

When I first decided to download this strategy it froze my com too.   But try again ...  it worked

The second time I decided to follow the steps that nasap had kindly put in vid.

But i dont use the mini 13 box chart as I have no need for that .  Just learn to read HA bars

All the best on another try

PS.... so as not to be viewed as not helpful  ...   I use the APB which u can obtain from the trading made simple thread.

its easier for me to read these HA bars then the stock HA on mt4.  You will notice alot of pin bar formations which could be helpful

Hello

I'm new to this thread (not really), but i'm a silent reader , and practice RENKO system with Mihailo since one month and thank you all for this great system. I got some small questions:

Sometime I see on nasap's picture Trading Times: Are there some rules for this? Which times do you use for trading this system? Is it depending on specific pairs?

Also there is a pink average??? on the pallada indicator in some pictures. What is it and how to interpret this?

ty, Plew

--- 帖子 #1812 ---
Looks like you have decided to sell the indicator that a number of people have asked about???? Are you tradeway? Does anyone have the code that Kickme is using Kickme do you have the code yet? If you are having trouble with it please PM me I may be able to help I am also a coder

--- 帖子 #1813 ---
I need to apologize. The indicator set that I was using was developed by Calstar and part of a larger program he started to teach people to trade. I was allowed to participate in the beta program, and I didn't realize that Calstar was not ok with me distributing the indicator. I had not spoken with him prior to my announcement that I would post the code. I wrongly assumed (and made an ass of myself) that since I was part of the original beta group that he would be ok with it, and that the lockdown on the code was to prevent changing or modifying it so that people didn't stray from the program.

I would like to apologize to Calstar and the followers of this thread. I have not been posting trades since at this time no one can trade the way that I was trading plus Calstar has taken the indicator access away.

So as my name says

Kickme

--- 帖子 #1814 ---
Do you still have the files? If so I can still help. If its a indicator that requires the account number to be referenced its not hard to work around. I would think that since you contributed to the development of the indicator you should have a say and a right to decide who gets to use it.

--- 帖子 #1815 ---
No, I am not and have nothing to do with them! Years ago I paid a huge sum for the #Pallada System which is not supported anymore. What I'm doing is, in my realy rare spare time, while others enjoy, testing indicators and they are undergoing my own development. If after all it works fine for me, I will give it a try. That's all! Therefore once again, since I've spent thousands of hours on development: I do not share all my secrets of trading, nor I'm going to sell it!

Certainly is.... !!!

But not for people who don't work for the pips

--- 帖子 #1826 ---
Hello Nasap Thank you for you tutelage in trading Renko and congrats on your mega pips today.

Is there anyway you can circle your entry points on the charts you just posted today. I was trading USD/JPY and AUD/JPY and did not come close to those results. In fact on USD/JPY I got whipsawed around finally broke even When I traded AUD/JPY I only had a net of 13 pips again with whipsaws.

I have been demo trading this system for over 2 months and have never come close to the results that you or a couple others are posting. I am sticking strictly to the rules and even have a check list of the rules before I pull the trigger. I am now wondering if as posted before by a few others if I am getting bad data which is contributing to my lack of results.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1827 ---
People like you make me sick. The indicators are not yours you paid nothing in either sweat or funds to develop them and all you want to do is STEAL someone else's work for your own financial gain as I am sure Kickme was planning to do. Kickme did not contribute to the development of my technique he tested it and received over 6 months of mentorship free of charge from me!!!!!

In addition I am sure he cannot give you the files because if he did break the code it wiped his computer out. If you do have the program please by all means go and hack them I cant wait. I used a new technique to protect the code developed by a software firm to protect my files similar to how they encrypt military files. When decompiled it destroys the data. Hidden in the code is a virus which will destroy your hard drive mark your IP and notify the person who owns the license.  Think I am bluffing??? Please try it, or just ask Kickme. See hackers and free loaders who aren't willing to put out the effort and money to learn and purchase tools are what causes most to take their indicators drop off the forums and leave others hanging.

Here is some free advice to those that are not hackers. You will NEVER, be successful stealing other peoples property. If you really want to succeed in Forex invest the time and the money to get the knowledge and the tools you need. If you cant afford $90.00 bucks or whatever to buy and indicator you like, you shouldn't be trading period. If you can and you steal it your  just a "$^S%$^S" !!!

Be thankful for mentors like Nasap who could easily just trade and walk away. Its not easy to maintain a thread. It is tedious and takes away from other things you could do. lt can be incredibly frustrating because you are constantly answering the same question over and over again or being asked to justify the trades or entry or exit.  Its free advice some good some bad (depending on the thread). Use it and be thankful others care.

--- 帖子 #1828 ---
Calstar  I said I am sorry I wrongly assumed that because you based your teaching off the turtles principle and were teaching it free of charge you would be ok with it being passed on. I did not intend to profit off of it. I am thankful for what you taught me it changed my trading. I also no longer have the files if anything good came out of this at least you know your protection works, it did wipe my computer. I was ticked off to put it in forum friendly language but I did try and break it.

thank you for your help in advancing my trading

I'm testing it with my demo account before applying to my real one. Today I was able to get 50 pips with it but I don't think I've got the hang of the system yet.

I'll try and upload some screenshots and results in the future...

Good trading Everyone!!

I don't have M2 and M3 in the "open offline chart". What can I do regarding this thing?

--- 帖子 #1831 ---
Try closing and reopening the platform again. You may also want to load more data on the 1 minute chart you can do this by setting chart scroll to none and hitting page up. It will allow you to see more of the offline charts.

--- 帖子 #1832 ---
As far as I understand it:

As Renko candles cannot be drawn from MT4 by default you have to use an EA for it. Renko candles use pure price action instead of TFs+PA. So if the price moves for instance 5 pips and the Renko candle is set to close after a five pip movement into one direction, that creates a new candle. It’s irrelevant how many hours or minutes it takes for the candle to move that much.

As you can see from nasap’s screenshots, he has 4 chart windows opened for 1 pair. Why?

You need one M1 chart (with EA set up properly) for the Renko M2 chart to appear and one (with EA set up properly)  for the M3 Renko chart to appear.

The M2 chart is needed because of the mini chart on M3. Indicator Stratman_MiniChart_v20 uses it. The other (M3) is where your trading happens.

So you won’t find M2-M3 offline charts in your MT4 until you have set up everything (EAs on M1 charts).

As for the indicators and settings, you can use post one and check out nasap’s posts.

You can also find a video and indies on page 78. –nasap was kind enough to post them

Please somebody correct me if I’m wrong about something.

--- 帖子 #1833 ---
Maybe someone could round up all the indicators that are used move the link to the installation video to the first post and go from there this question about how to install etc comes up often. I know that I kept having my platform freeze when I tried to download and then load indicators.

Fact 2: Fibo Levels are very important for every trading!

Fact 3: Pivot Points are very important in accordance with Fibos and Round Numbers

(You can see many of my trades I just ignored those lines!)

Fact 4: A picture is worth a 1000 words

Put your rules on a picture and keep it open all the time.

Ok so I realize that after this post I am going to be called ungrateful a whiner and every other name in the book but I think I a speaking for a large number of the silent majority when I say

Nasap what the hell are you doing!!!!!!!! You caught 884 pips which is great but how. What system are you trading? Because its not the one with the THV indicators which makes me question your motives for posting in this thread.

1) Read back a few pages when you asked Kickme who was kicking it pretty great in my view and having better results to leave the thread because what he was trading was not the THV system. At the time with 30 pips you were well on your way to your weekly goal. Now you have surpassed your weekly goal by a mile yet you keep trading and posting after the fact charts. You always seem to find the correct pair.  The 1 or 2 pairs that doesn't get whipsawed around, trend heavily on that day and spit out money like an ATM. It is almost as if you are trying to prove that your method is better.

2) In 2 weeks you have had multiple questions asked about the indicators you are using. These questions are relevant because you have defaulted to the leader of this thread. You have responded that you will not give up all your secrets. That's fine and understandable but, the 1st secret is actually a commercial indicator which you say isn't supported but it is. Doesn't really matter its not part of the system and no one else can use it, but it perked enough people up that questions were asked and I am sure google searches were done and sales picked up on said indicator. The past couple weeks each time you post a tremendous day you have a different indicator on the chart. This could imply that you are using the indicator to get those results, and in turn getting PMs asking for the indicator.

3) I ask if you could please mark you entry and exit points on the charts, so that we the humble serfs in this thread may learn to recognize what an actual signal looks like in the storm of indicators that are involved in trading this "easy" system. You respond with a comment that it has never been easier to find ABC patterns using Renko and post a screen shot with not 1 but 2 new indicators and no explanation as to how you are using them if we should use them or how they fit in the system.

So with all that out of the way.

What the &^&& are you doing because you certainly are not trading THV according to the parameters of the system itself. I traded yesterday just like you. I worked on USD/JPY had a net of 29 pips. On AUD/USD I lost 36 pips. On EUR/JPY I got 3 pips. I have been trading this system for 2 months and never had those types of wins. I would like to believe that I am not a complete idiot savant.  I am sure I am coming off as bitter and I am not. If the point of a thread is to explore trade theories and ideas, how is that being done when you can't post your rules for entry and exit and mark them on the chart after the fact?  Myself and I am sure others who are struggling are not asking for your secrets or for you to call trades. We want to learn and succeed as you "appear" to have done. We cant do that if you are using other indicators and not showing the reason and logic behind the entry and exits you take. Your charts show arrows everywhere for entry and exit is that how you are trading? Are you ignoring certain signals? Please clue us in. We get it, you know how to trade your system. However simply posting your success using indicators that aren't available to others is exactly what you didn't want Kickme to do because it serves no purpose. It frustrates and discourages and frankly has turned this thread into your own trading journal.

Just look at the post about how easy it is to find ABC patterns. I agree looking at that chart with that indicator its very easy. So how do I get one. Because I don't see an easy ABC pattern on that chart.

So please one more time when you post can you show entry and exit and  just a word as to why. The attached chart is from yesterday where I got 29 following the rules as set out

--- 帖子 #1850 ---

Impossible !!!

Have you ever lost ???

--- 帖子 #1852 ---
Using a box size of 10 and watching 8 or ten charts makes his numbers quite achievable with only a bare chart and trendlines.

Some people are more focused on duplicating indicators than actually seeing the entries.

Instead of copying others, it is best to examine the actions of the price bars and make decisions re entries and exits.

Trading is a self taught skill.

--- 帖子 #1853 ---
Perhaps those numbers are achievable doing as you have said, but that is not what Nasap is doing according to his posts and that is my point. Trading can be a self taught skill but it also takes abase form which to build from. That base could be considered the system or technique used. I am not trying to copy Nasap trades I am trying to learn the system so that I may in turn teach myself

Hi Nasap,

I like using LineTrader EA. It gives me freedom. I don't need to be in front of my screen.

But I want to learn what's your amount for "PipsRangeFromLine" parameter of Line trader EA?

And  What's "Slippage" parameter used for?

Sorry for my bad English.

Thanks,

Regards.

BMUTLU

--- 帖子 #1860 ---
I've set both to "0"

I don't know if Parameter Slippage realy matters since we are using MT4 Plattform, because there is always Slippage (MT4 has a very slow (bad) execution).

But what's Slippage?

Slippage is defined as the difference in pips between the order price and the execution price for a particular transaction. The Slippage can be negative or positive as well, depending on network speeds and market volatility.

All parameters for the block indicators are the same. Depending on your trading style you set it to false if you are conservative trader. Set it to true if you are more agressive trader. In accordance to the settings of the block indicators you also must adjust the #Pallada VQI!

Coral and Block Indicators are the heart of the system (filter). If you dont want to use this filters, just ignore them and find your own rules! You will find many of such entries if you look back and you will always ask yourself, "why I have to wait?". On the other hand you will have not entered into a trade, because PA was still not above / below Coral and you have been protected from false signal. Then you are happy again!

It is not a glitch Renko does repaint so you have to be careful with your entry. You can use indicators as a filter as many are doing here but remember that the indicators that you are using are designed for time frame trading as a result they will show things much faster and the indicators need to be optimized properly for use on a Renko chart.

Hello All,

Hope you guys are doing great. I have come to know about 'Renko' chart few days ago. Since then I have been searching for a suitable yet effective Renko chart trading system. I read many formulas and applied many indicators/EA but nothing work for me. Some had technical problems or some just didn't show good result.

Now after finding this thread, it seemed to me that this 'Mihailo' renko system might be fruitful. So, I followed all the instructions given in the post 1 and installed everything accordingly. [See my chart which looks way different from recently posted charts here]. I also read the trading rules. But those are few years back's system or method.

Now I am seeing a bit different charts are being discussed here. Is there any final rules to follow which more or less people are following here now?

Also, what are the EAs or Indicators used in those recent charts?

Please help me guys. I am badly in need of following a good system.

Thanks

CONFIRMATION OF THE RENKO BAR CROSSING 12 pip chart with the 40 period coral

That indicator like the bars themselves repaints have you corrected it? Is it me or does this system just keep growing and growing and growing. I feel likethe energizer bunny

--- 帖子 #1893 ---
understand your concern;

i believe that indicator does not repeat...other TMA indicators do but i believe that does not;

i look for confirmation on the longer-term charts as when you shorten the coral...you get more false moves...this adds confirmation i believe but please test yourself and confirm

cheers

--- 帖子 #1894 ---
I suggest you experiment a bit with the chart, practice a lot, and develop a chart that 'talks' to you. Nasap is quite successful because he understands the function of every aspect of his chart, he has worked with it until he has it right for himself.... and what he has built may not be for you, the chart is something that you have to understand and build based on your own interpretations.

--- 帖子 #1895 ---
Thanks but have you seen my chart? I think it's not right one. Everything is Messy there. All others here have a decent chart which is must for a decent method. So I want the right chart first. Then a little bit of instructions of how to interpret that chart. Thus I would be able to make something hopefully.

--- 帖子 #1896 ---
Previously, it was Mihailo's chart but recently it is NaSap's chart became more popular ... he/she simplify the whole thing

Go to page 78 (post # 1542)

You can learn about NaSap's chart, complete with all indicator he used...

Read and digest all the pages after that...i bet you'll have the right chart you've been looking for

Good luck

--- 帖子 #1897 ---
I didn't get some useful information from this indicator to make the system more effective! Do not forget that this system was called a scalper by Mihailo with a respective goal of 10 - 15 Pip per Trade. With the redesigned system you can gain the double easily, if you are waiting patiently for the right setup.

regards nasap

--- 帖子 #1898 ---

--- 帖子 #1900 ---
I do not think it looks messy, I do think that you do not understand all that is on your chart. Try to remove an item and see if you understand the remaining chart. put that one back and then remove another..

These people who have the neat and tidy looking charts have examined what is available and then made their changes. and that would have taken them many hours of study. You will have to devote weeks of learning to master this in order to get the rewards. The most important area of your chart is the price bars. Learn how to read them and then have a look at the other indicators.

You can also study the THV thread where the system was developed to get an insight as to the indicators.

Hi Nasap

I remember you said that you are using Line Trader EA for entering the market...

Is it because in this strategy, 'instant execution' is quite difficult to do?

Sometimes market moves so fast, once it moves ... bammm,it never looked back...causing us missing the good entry point

As we knew chasing the market is not a good idea, it often will lead us to trouble

Regards,

RockRobb

--- 帖子 #1904 ---
'instant execution' is quite difficult on all systems on upcoming PA but more difficult with Renko and HA overlay! You have the choice to set a Limit / Stop Order or let the work be done by an EA like LineTrader.

Hello fellows !

Though I haven't seen any repainting issues with the original indicators mihailo posted in post #1 , I still think I should ask my fellow traders that if they have seen these indicators repainting in any manner , if yes then what can one do to avoid these situation ?

I don't think that they repaint unless it's an active candle and the direction of PA reverses within the candle itself.

hi kickme,

nice that you have great results, but I think is pointless to post your results if we don't have any clue about your system and also you can not share it...

--- 帖子 #1913 ---
Hello kickme,

are you using renko parallel? what are you using to color your renko candles?

also, i notice that Miailo has 13 complex, i think it's very useful, is there anyone who can make changes to that original to make it work for the  4 indicators nasap is using, cci, fim, stock & osma? i'd be very gratefull if some one could.

--- 帖子 #1914 ---
Why are these differences?

The first is the graph on my computer, the second is the graph on my laptop. They are the same parameters in both cases.

Can you post a chart, please? What is the best chart?

--- 帖子 #1915 ---
Hi Flaviu,

maybe you have different kind of renko than me, perhaps your problem is that you have your renko ea running on your M3 chart, i think it should only be running on M1 chart. I know running it on both charts can mess with the data feed.

Also check the M1 history on both machines and see if the amount of data is the same for the same time period on both machines, also if they are different accounts you could have slightly different history data.

--- 帖子 #1916 ---
Not sure what you mean by which chart is best. Are they different settings? If not here we go.

Renko is a price based strategy what this means is that we are no longer looking at time. Each candle is plotted based on the price range. This can cause your candles, day close time, etc. To vary from broker to broker.

Why is this? Each broker quotes a price based on the interbank rate and their shade (shade is the counter position they take in regards to what the retail sum total is) and markup. One broker may be at 100.234 while another broker may be at 100.237 this little difference may not seem like very much but it becomes a bigger issue as to when a candle will close and a new one will open, For example: If FXDD is at 100.332 and Alpari is at 100.339 the next tick up could cause a new a new candle to form on Alpari but not on FXDD.  This can also cause a candle to repaint once the tick is made up.

Because of the aforementioned this can also cause a problem with other indicators repainting or lagging even more.

Now for my candles they are not being recolored they are a custom indicator designed by Calstar please contact him for more info.

Killerno Why don't you actually contribute something to the thread before you start asking people to leave it. How about the non repainting semafor that you have or the other indicators? There are people trying to do ABC counts and that indicator will be a positive contribution. As for sharing my system how much more plain can I be I am trading Renko naked. Attached is I think a similar indicator to the semafor (I have never used this) but may help some in counting waves.

hi kickme,

I don't want to argue with you and I did not say to leave the thread. The only thing I said is to post charts without knowing anything about your system is pointless. But nice results anyway. I am trying out something using 123pattern and ichimoku.

Thank you for your answer and for your help! I use only one broker in the present: Armada Markets! I used the same settings on my PC and on my laptop. But the charts are so different!

--- 帖子 #1920 ---
Hi kickyou, thanks for reply, i realised after i posted you weren't using parallel renko, i'm easily confused.

Have you given your strategy a go using parellel renko? It might be interesting to see if it gives improved results.

Also thanks for not shouting at me for asking questions you've already answered, sorry about that.

I tried to find the indi you're using to color the candles, would you mind to maybe give a hint at what it's called so i know what i'm referring to if i cantact Calstar? maybe you did already and i didn't see it.

--- 帖子 #1921 ---
Hello I have never heard of "parellel renko" I have used about every indicator out there including median Renko.  There is no reason for me to try anything else out for my trading how much more can I improve my results?  I have 390 pips in 4 days. Would have had more but I closed trades that are still profitable. 3 of 4 trades were winners. The Loonie trade I closed is still going. Absolutely no reason for me to look elsewhere at some new thing. Post it here maybe others can use it.

--- 帖子 #1922 ---
Hi, Yes, i think you're probably right, it looks like you don't need to improve your results, but in case anyones interested in a little experimentation here is a parallel renko by someone called Jake, so thankyou to him. Would be interested in any feedback about it. Attached File(s)   Renko_Live_Jake_para_real_v5.mq4

After PA is breaking the Coral (M2) it will pull back. The end of that pull back should be the Coral (M3). Means PA is very close to the Cloud & Coral! If using the #Pallada VQI, there mus be a clear signal for the desired direction. Enter the Trade on 2nd or 3rd bar of block indicator if candle closes above cloud (opposite for short).

That's it! But always think about, this system is not a holy grail and nobody can grant you a successful Trade.

I hope this are some useful information other than just posting useless charts without any information. There are some idiots out here hanging on a frequented thread and posting their bullshit!

Always good luck and happy trading!

Hello Harada,

Could you post BS_filter indi?

Thank You in advance.

--- 帖子 #1929 ---
Hello,

Thanks for the Instruction.

What is that indi into the #Pallada VQI? Is it any MA? And how to insert that into #Pallada VQI?

My Chart is still not so clear. [Please check above]

I want it as neat as yours. What to add/remove from it?

Thanks

Trade plan for today.

NOTE: US session has been iffy at best for movement.

I am currently long on Sterling I have a projected daily top at 1.5847 with a breakout targeting 1.5882. Bias is currently hanging on as bullish but just barely below 1.5771 we have a bearish bias. There is some room to the downside on a switch with a projected daily bottom at 1.5703 and a break out to 1.5641.

So hopefully that's enough information for those that think my charts are BS at least I will try and call my trades unlike those peddling pallada indicators.

See above

Yep,

My setup for entry - SELL !

PA is below Coral on M2 (I use 10pip on M2 and 5pip for M3)

Draw fibo form HH to HL, watch carefully PA about 50%, entry below the cloud ( yellow box )

My SL is above 61.8 % fibo + some pips + spread

My TP is TP1 = -0.236 or TP2 = -0.382, sometimes I exit at 0% fibo (B -line)

I now, its nothing new ... but I'm trying to use Fibonacci Trading with Bobokus  http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=50767

Hi Guys,

You’re welcome but I’m just sharing my take on things. I’m still just a newbie trader you know.

You should read back this thread a bit and study what nasap and some other professional traders wrote.

You can find every indicator you need on page 78. You can also create your own templates (and I would suggest doing so). How? It’s on page 78 (posted by nasap).

Sure. Here it is:

Hi  Khwaj18

--- 帖子 #1944 ---
Snagged a few pips overnight as the ranges held up pretty well in Sterling and Euro

GBP good for 33 as I took profit at the predicted daily range top, It gave a small head fake and eventually hit and retreated from the breakout high.

Euro ranged all night but still produced some good opportunities between the bias point and the top. That head fake into the bear zone got me for a few but still managed a to net 64 off of 5 trades. I hope you all found the levels useful.

Have a great weekend!!!!

--- 帖子 #1945 ---
Wow no new posts, that stinks. So currently I am sitting on my hands with the gaps yesterday and the FOMC this week I will most likely just sit out till Thursday.

Hi All,

The market sort of sucks right now. Hopefully that's the reason why the thread is so silent.

nasap,

I kind of miss your posts. It's always good to see your steady results with this system.

Did you find any good opportunity lately?

My entry today:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It rewarded me with 30+ pips. With a relatively tight trailing stop, I had it running during the USD data release as well.

Good luck everyone!!

--- 帖子 #1947 ---
Currently it's not some kind of easy Trading, but those cycles happen and we have to face it. Yesterday I could fetch some Pips on EURUSD and NZDUSD, +160 in total. Since it was not in accordance with the rules of Renko Thv 5! I did not post anything. Today I missed the nice opportunity to buy on NZDUSD! It looks almost the same like AUDUSD and was good for at least +50 Pip.

regards nasap

--- 帖子 #1948 ---
While that could be a reason another reason could be the same that I started looking elsewhere.

This thread has become an EGO fest of who can get the most pips. It ran off the rails of teaching a while back. Your last chart is a perfect example. There are, I think multiple opportunities to trade on that chart yet you took only 1. Why is that? What was the trailing stop that you used? What are your settings for the coral?  What info did your chart provide?

Answer: NONE its just another posted trade that offers no insight at all to how it was successful.

--- 帖子 #1949 ---
Accordingly to the rules I see just one opportunity and that's what he did! If I am not totally mistaken the Trade was entered on the 2nd blue candle above the Coral with a TS of 15 Pip. Absolutely correct!

Is it hard to understand or to identify? Why don't you post your charts and show your mistakes that we can discuss about it? There is no reason for the successful Traders to show anything, they know how it works! But they can help you to become more successful.

regards nasap

--- 帖子 #1950 ---
Very clear and informative....  packed with good insight .

Thanks for the chart

If this was just a blue u buy and red you sell set-up than there would be over trading and letting the mkt slowly but surely erode your acct with its ebb and flow.

hahahahah

Here's a clue for those too focused on candy colors....   structure leaves clues.  )

--- 帖子 #1951 ---
Hi guys,

I’m sorry that you feel that way. I can’t agree with you entirely. Sure there are some people in this thread who maybe just want to boast how many pips they earn without sharing much.

That is not my intention. I post my entries in accordance with this system. I could have written down the entry rules in my posts but they were mentioned tons of times before. And what I mean by „this system”? I think that the foundation of this system consists of the renko charts, the 4 histograms (cci, stoch, osma and fim), the cloud and the coral. Everything else is an extra. I’m starting to like the Pallada indi more and more too.

The settings have been shared a few times in the past by Mihailo and by nasap as well. I use the default settings for the coral (55) and for the charts. nasap uses slightly different settings (you can find it in the thread) because nasap is more confident and experienced than for instance me. But you too have to experiment with it,  test and fine-tune it to your personality. That doesn’t mean that the rules of the system change.

And you can use trailing stop the way it fits you (and adjust the trailing step –the number of pips it trails behind of your order - accordingly). I use an EA for it but MT4’s inbuilt TS feature is also an option. It’s also a way to exit a trade but of course you have to be profitable for that.

It just would be nice to see some involvement from people other than asking questions that have already been answered in this thread.

As I have already said I’m only a newbie but if anybody has any questions about the indicators I use or regarding the charts I post just ask them away.

One trade today...for now:

You can see how price broke out from ranging (Pallada + TLs). I was a little late entering this trade and stopped out with +20 pips (using trailing stop).

Good luck folks!

Entry on brake TL, easy 20 pips

Now we reached 50% fibo and brake S1,  if PA will be above 61,8 %  and coral i'll entry for buy, if PA will be below 38,2% and cloud i'll enrty for sell.

Harada Nice trade well thought out. Halfday I agree with him just ask but also read the thread and from what I understand you are receiving free coaching so be patient.

Last night was a scalp trade on the range break pretty much the same type set up as Harada for those new to trading one big benefit of this type of trading style is that it makes it very easy to spot a range. As many have a found out ranges lead to whipsaws, whipsaws lead to draw down, draw down leads to depression and anger which eventually will lead to a blown account.

As you can see there is another range forming right now. Which will break when the FED announces that they will not taper (my personal belief).

Any ideas out there on which way the fed will go or how it will effect the market going forward?

Be patient in waiting for a set up and the right conditions and the pips will come.

UJ sell - price touched 50% then broke cloud and coral,

Hello Traders, a bit earlier in this thread I was talking about the right timing. Today another small lesson how you can benefit from the Renko Thv 5!.

While analyzing the charts I always was thinking about your questions on MM / RM / RR, the right timing and very special the S/L. By using the normal settings it is a bit difficult not just for beginners. For this I changed the settings of the RenkoLiveChart EA. The result is realy amazing! Have a look on the 2 charts below and think about the entries I have drawn. Doesn't look good? Yep, you are right!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Let's have a look on the 3rd chart. It shows what I have changed in the settings of the RenkoLiveChart EA.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now back to the charts 4 and 5. The same charts like before but much more clear to identify the entries buy / sell. Analyze your charts and carefully watch the cloud! The entry is always in / on the low / high of the cloud and there is always a confirmation by the 4 block indicators.

Happy trading and always lots of Pips.

--- 帖子 #1960 ---
Many thanks Nasap. I see the price breakout very clearly but do you mean the cloud has to make higher highs - lower lows? I also see that you have stopped using the stratman mini chart. Any reason as why? Thanks

--- 帖子 #1961 ---
I'm still using the Stratman but for this post I decided to delete it, because it does not give additional useful information. With Stratman I can not go back in the chart for 2 weeks or so.

Look this chart, no more candles, only the cloud with the marked entries. Maybe this will make it a bit more clear.

--- 帖子 #1962 ---
Thanks and interesting post.

Here is something to consider...  with wicks on , the trader knows where the price had actually traded to . Think about this, how long can a 5 pip renko be ?

The average would be about 14 pip swing approx. Thats the ave.

So would taking price information away be beneficial ?

Unless of course one increases the SL .

Frankly by reducing the SL ( ie: not showing the whole information) it may be giving a false sense .

But it all depends on one's understanding of trading renko ierice and what a trader wants to achieve from it.
)    a 3 box stop is always quite acceptable to many but on occasion one can get away with less...   which is dependant on mkt conditions.

Just my take on how i trade with renko

Best regards to everyone's trading )

--- 帖子 #1963 ---
Many tnx jonjon for additional informations and you are absolutely right. We should never forget that Renko with HA overlay makes a chart looking nice and smooth. But there are lots of tools help us in almost all situations. Therefore I use an indicator to predict the range of the actual candle.

What we want to achieve with Renko Thv 5!

Each of us should think about first, what are the goals. Are you more a friend of a long term trade or more a short term trader like a scalper? Of course you can combine both!

Imho a combination of both will be the very best solution. But you have to find out what fits you the best!

--- 帖子 #1964 ---
Nasap ,

Thanks for the rangeprdictor ,  very much like something I used on NT7 when i developed the range bar strategy. Did not know there was something similar for mt4.

Many thanks again

Yes agree with you  ....   I dont hold overnight on renko or range. Combo of scalp and intra-day swing.

Cos regardless of position size its the probability i work off .  So we use bigger sizes .

Much counter to the conventional propergated MM "wisdom"

For 3-5 pips we are quite happy. So for 15-30 pips we are laughing.

Best regards and capture those pips

J

##  you are a good mentor and I hope the people on the thread can learn from what you've shared.

Cos I see only a handfull that get some of  it. )##

Since I dont have the patience to "mentor" , let me share one key ....  every strategy has its strength and weaknesses but it all works.

The difference is the trader and price action. In the case of renko and fixed pip boxes price action it is geometric structure and continuation structures.

For range, there are a few identified continuation structures like 2bar, 3 bar and 4 bar structures which we have documented. For renko its a lot cleaner.

But overlayed with HA it becomes different and less clear.

You have showed this in your trading approach, thought I highlight it .

Thanks for the stratman info and chart. Just to be clear may I ask again. Does the cloud need to make higher highs etc. On the example you give the first five trades are clear but why not take the very last trade at the end of the chart 11 September? The cloud is lower, below coral etc. Thanks

--- 帖子 #1967 ---
Hello Zoog, I have drawn some examples on the chart only. Of course there is still another opportunity but since direction of PA is sideways it depends on M2 chart also.

I’m sorry, I didn’t realize that my chart differs that much from the normal renkolivechart. I’m testing another version now which is supposed to be a kind of median renko chart. That is why it seems that my coral has different settings. I still use the default 55 for it.

You can see the difference between the two charts below. The settings are the same for both versions:

box size: 6

timeframe: 3

wicks: yes

renkolivechart v. 3.3 - this is the normal renko chart:

The other one I’m testing now is a modified version of the normal renko ea. It was created by fxkred:

Tnx for explanation and additional info to your Renko System. I was already sure about you are using a different Renko EA like Median or something like that. I also tried Median Renko on M3 but not that much satisfied. Other than on M2, it looks great there.

However, AUDUSD did not work for me on 3rd trade, BE only! +115 for today so far. Not bad.

You are absolutely right again!

It was late already and I was going to stop trading for that day. But suddenly it gave me many signals and I decided to give it a try on GBPUSD and once again EURJPY. Finally I end with +90 for EURJPY and +60 for GBPUSD. The total for the week is a +315 Pip gain (50 / 75 / 40 / 90 / 60). 5 trades within 2 days!

Just analyze your charts and find out how many times you could take a profit on 10, 15, 20, 25 and so on. Try to work with partitial TP and TS until you find out what's the very best for your trading style. (Btw I'm not a friend of TS!)

Hi guys, just an overview on what happened yesterday. I don't wanna say it was a monday as usual. It was a real fu**ing monday!  The US pairs, big mouth full of promissing signals but nothing behind, let me in the rain with just some crumbs. Realy frustrating!  Also JPY was jumping on the Coral like a monkey on the rope but at least in the late evening it made my day!

If I can say one thing about the JPY, and this is the absolutely truth, it's a trustworthy and reliable currency. If I have a profit of $10.000, $9.000 comes with JPY!  I'm with JPY for almost 8 years now and never got disappointed. But we also know, this market conditions change very fast always and we never know what will happen the next.

My EURJPY construct was worth a +130 Pip gain plus a +75 Pip on USDJPY. This shows again that patience is the key to success!

Wish you all a nice week with lots of Pips!

Back to the roots, since I am bored about the questions to the additional indicators I am using. You dont need any of them! You dont need an M2 chart even! Open your eyes, watch the chart and follow PA! +78 Pip gain on USDJPY so far.

I was a bit late with the entry, should enter directly on signal.

Nasap,

You are 100% correct. All that is required is the m3 chart, trend line EA, and of course the Pallada histogram and its family and also the main one 30 or 15 minute time frame chart. PLUS most important the 1 minute chart to keep our mind free from confusion.

Following your instructions I am now doing better in our new hedge fund office.

Would be starting the portfolio management soon. Can u please refer some links on how to manage OPM  ?

OTHER PEOPLES MONEY???

Waiting for your reply sir.

A short review on today. As I wrote earlier, US pairs disappoint me and I did not monitor them anymore although one trade was still in the pipe. Big surprise today when I opened the chart on AUDUSD again. Unexpectedly it was running for me over night and hit the target with a plus of 110 Pip. Further  I was in EURUSD with a plus of 60 Pip. Cable did not work, +15 Pip (TP at +35 was not triggered). USDJPY also failed for a buy, +15 Pip only. A plus of 278 Pip for today, a total gain of 483 Pip for the week (2 days only!)!

It's not always the same parameter for all pairs, you have to adjust for each pair! Something between 8 - 16 will work fine.

Hello guys, just a short review on today. Yesterday late evening I found out, something goes wrong with my workstation. Could it be a virus (my first thought!)? But there is an up to date Avira Anti Virus installed! Hm, ok I check it with the Acronis Rescue CD (on my USB Stick) and it found a Trojan in the temp folder of my user profile! Fu**in Avira!!! Anyway it did not solve the problem thus I decided to change the HD with the 2nd working OS on it. Of course not all was up to date, but finally most was working again. This kept me busy for some hours and after all I was not in the mood for trading. On todays late evening, after I was back home again, I did a trade on EURJPY, USDJPY and EURUSD. 2 x BE on EURUSD and USDJPY plus 40 Pip on EURJPY. That's all!

Hi All,

Yes, my thoughts exactly on Monday. It sucked big time. I lost 20 pips and missed the nice big moves.

Today was better with +80 pips in total.

My AUD/USD trade:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I’m thinking about how I could let my trades ride a little longer. The coral seems to provide a pretty decent way to do it. A lot of times the price only tests the coral but there is not one candle that can close above or below it (against the trend). Sometimes it takes some balls to hold your position because price can jump back close to the coral (and your opened position) but in a trending market it could worth the risk.

Some examples:

I know that it’s nothing new. Just sharing my thoughts. An exit strategy built on this approach could be interesting. That’s why I’m trying this out. We’ll see.

Buy Mac and forget viruses. You can run MT4 under Mac using Wine or Crossover. According to Forexcube, a well known FF trader, his PC was being hacked almost everyweek. Believe or not, he believes he was targeted because of his activities in FF.....  Check out his postings.

I remember several years ago when i was searching for a forext indicator through Bing, i clicked a link in a finacial website. Right after this click my Dell laptop was infected by a nasty warm virus. I managed to kill it using Malwarebytes, but i wasted my whole day. It can happen to anybody and even if you installed norton or mcafee or whatever, you cannot prevent it. Now i am a Mac user and feel less vulnerable.

Hello all,

I'm just curious whats wrong with this system. Many of you are claiming nice and steady profits, but Mihailos demo account after big grow went slowly back to zero and then Mihailo left this thread without any notice for ever.

I'm missing something?

This system looks really interesting but now I'm confused if it worths the time to read the whole thread and spend the time with forward testing.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #2031 ---
Hy Colombino,

read from this page when Nasap came into the game http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...69#post6759469.

This system is great and almost mechanical, you just need to follows signals and rules and you will be ok.

Regards!

--- 帖子 #2032 ---
Tnx for your advice I already tried a Linux Version with wine (wine is not emulator) but the big problem is wine itself. While the system OpenSuse was working pretty good, the effect has gone after starting wine. It slows down although there are still lots of free ressources. I asked some others about that problem but they state me exactly the same! If I'm looking for a native Linux Software, there are no Brokers supporting it. Java based like the one from Oanda is no alternative. I'd realy like to change back to OpenSuse, but need a good solution.

--- 帖子 #2033 ---
I've neaver heard of that. I use Crossover, a commercial version of Wine in my dual core, 4gb ram macbook and it works like a charm. My template has many custom indis loaded and i even run two instances of mt4 at the same time for dual sceens. My Macbook is a cheap entry model made in year 2010. I used to use Ubuntu in a assembled PC desktop before, and i found its resource management wasn't as efficient as Windows running in the same machine. I think that's because of the drivers which are not properply tested and optimized for the hardware.

--- 帖子 #2034 ---
Interesting topic! What systems do you use with MT4? And especially with Renko System my WindowsXP is slowing down!

What would be the perfect system?

WOW what a week and bunch of BS!!! Where is your proof. Post an account statement or hook up a trade explorer. Once again you pop up with an indicator on your chart that is only yours. Not to be out done by others, you have perfect entries and seem to ignore the numerous false signals and whipsaws on those charts and double the results of the only other successful trader posting in this thread.

In a market that has been devoid of any volatility at all the past 60 days you find the pairs that move. You don't like the US pairs yet, you decide to trade them this week. Why the change Nasap?

I believe that the moderators have to step in. Nasap is a commercial vendor who is setting this thread up for a signal service.

a) "wont share all his secrets"

b) uses indicators that only he has, or promotes commercial versions

c) has no set or defined rules for entry, or exit which means only he can trade the way he trades and only he can get those results.

d) has posted links to a commercial trade manager that pays affiliates, most of whom are signal services (aren't commercial links a violation?)

e) recently posted a screen shot of a commercial trade copier (linked to his account) and there is mention of managing other peoples money.

f) has bashed others who have posted more successful and easier to read charts.

Joined less then 6 months ago and when his legitimacy was questioned Harada shows up( 30 days later)  and starts having success. Here is something odd the only posts either has made are in this thread.

Nasap prove that you actually took those trades its not hard.

For those that want to bash me for calling out some one who is going commercial go ahead, but do the research and wake up you are being set up.

Beautiful results .... much .. maybe too ... I have read the entire thread and it's the truth interesting ... especially when you gave the equity curve and overview of couples who are you going ....I have two questions .... Although silly, but just ask :-)

First - What is the setting Renko (M2 = 5pips bar, M3 = 10pips bar ...)

Second Pallada settings you use for all couples the same? What settings do you use? If I understood and seen in past references and 8-11 should be OK alone.Thanks ....

Hi Mihailo,THANK YOU FOR THE SEEMINGLY AWESOME SYSTEM ( caps sorry) and thank to all other traders who have been sHARING THIER SYSTEMS.

I do need some help if someone would be so kind. I tried for about 2 hrs to open the rar file and couldn't . i was able to dwnload the stratman font into my computer. Iam able to open zip files and copy and paste tpl and ind. files. i did do as such well mainly only the templ. files and they are very incomplete charts. What if its possible if someone has a zip file or the time to send all the ind. and templ. individually that would be appreciated. I do have indicators that  i think would be helpful to share and bits and pieces of strategies that some would see as useful. Sorry for my ignorance on copying the rar file i have been able to  do so in the past but not now. Thank you, Matt

I agree with you in 100%. IMHO he can't have so many entries and no loss. I'm trading with Nasap's system for about few months, i'm doing exactly what he does and it doesn't work at all! There is so many false signals that you can't have a clean entries (Nasap said it is possible). If you look closely at Nasap's charts you can notice that he isn't always using his system because some of the entries are false signals ( false signals that appear when using his system) (many of them are indeed good entries with right signal but like i said you can find those with false signals, but Nasap's entries are always success, why is that?) and he doesn't mind that and just enter, i think that Nasap is using different system or different rules of entries.

I think that Nasap gave as a car without an engine and we know that he wont give us this engine so why did he made this thread? To show off? Why does he keep posting in this thread?

Maybe the right answer has Halfdaytrade?

Cheers Vimes.

At least one Trader out here watching carefully! Tnx for the question. It was a sell of course.

OMG what a poor guy! Who are you? Who gave you the right to talk and write in this way? Bitterness and jealousy is speaking here, because not able himself to fetch some rotten crumbs! You are nothing, a nobody, just a loser! Did you, at least once, something right in your life? I don't think so, because you are a loser, you will stay as loser for ever!

Whom did I offer any commercial? My mailbox is full of requests but I did not make any offer!

Go and pray, ask the Lord for forgivness (especially some more brain) and maybe you will be blessed with wisdom and power to become a good person.

While I already live a life, modestly but perfectly satisfied, on my wonderful holiday island you are still working as a simple factory worker, office clerk or just an unemployed.

hy halfdaytrade,

i don't want to defend of offend anybody,just will share  opinion.

Maybe you got right about some facts regarding Nasap trading i don't know,but man give us some good principles of his work.

Why everybody wants to copy someone.Forex isn't bussiness like this,everybody need to find their own unique way.

Nasap clearly shares some of his idea and you can learn much from him,he gave us something for free (at least i didn't see that he requires money)

Who cares about his statement,if he is successful then great, good to him, you can only prosper and get good idea of his trades.

Just try to trade with this system like he advise and you will be profitable.Not 100% like neither system but you will be in profit at the end of the month.

If you can have only 1/10 result like he have you can make money so don't bother with attacks,employ what can use you in your trading and share some of your ideas  how to make this system better.

This system is semi-mechanical and i like it very much,other depend on traders knowledge,experience and sense of market,and everybody seeing market in different way.I am thankfull to Nasap for his ideas that I implement on my unique way and i hope he will continue to teach about how he is doing it.

Just my 2 cents,

Wish you good luck!

Hi,

Good Day!

Many of the people have started feeling jealous about you now sir. Anyone can put grass to the cow, how can one spoon feed them? Its their mental ability which should do the work and think should I EAT OR NOT !

Anyways, my son and me have chosen the most complex methods of achieving success. He has finished his 10th grade and wants to pass IIT(Indian Institue of Technology) and me the online trading.

Well, please wish us both success.

BTW, what I have noticed is that, with Renko, the real power comes from the LineTrader EA so you can catch the breakouts. Good understanding of the trend-lines/S/R is crucial. I am still learning and the screens Nasap has posted really helps! Thank you!

Just finished (right now) reading the thread.

Great thread by the way.

This Thread on FF is somehow confusing.  I started reading it about 2 months ago, downloaded the original system by Mihailo, I watched charts with that template for a week on a demo platform.  Amazing Scalping System.  Specially for Newbies (clear entry and exit)  But not really for me.  SL 50 pips with a TP of 15 is not my style.  Luckily I came back to check the last posts some weeks ago and somebody asked if this system is very bad, because Mihailo left and nobody shows any results.  Then NaSap appears, showing good results trading the Original plan since May.

What some people don`t seem to understand and sadly they leave awful comments, it`s that Nathalia trades Forex, she has learnt to be a trader, she doesn`t take every single signal, and she has being experimenting with new indicators like Pallada VQI, Trend Lines, etc.  And she has improved a lot this system.

What I must agree with other traders is that experience of a trader is not easy to replicate.  If she doesn`t take false signals and she takes the best ones is due to experience.  She has being trading for years and with this system since May.

I have just taken my first trade with THV5, Buy GBPUSD at 1.60713 SL 25 pips.  It is not only the signal, I trade my believes, and THV gives me the entry.  Long trend on GBP is bullish, USIndex is going down, it is Monday and there are no more news on until late. I will probably move my SL to Breakeven soon, and let it run.  So that is based on my experience in trading. My Daily System indicates a Bearish Reversal, but I don`t take it, with US Gov ShutDown no way I buy Dollars.

And NaSap also applies experience.  I have learnt a lot just looking at your charts.

And I am thinking of starting to trade JPY, I understand they are the main reason of your BIG success, because it is easy to predict moves.  USD has being very erratic this year.

Great to learn from you, and please don`t be discourage by those ones that are not able to read the whole thread.

--- 帖子 #2060 ---
I like this system – I am generally very weary of anything that shows very few losses so I take the results with a pinch of salt. Whoever said that you can't really make it as a trader by copying anyone else is correct in IMHO. That said, what one can do is to take parts of a system that you like and build your own - something that suits your style of trading.

Someone who wants action and lots of it is never going to make money with a long term trending system and vice versa. You have to know what sort of trader you are. I will say one thing. Look at what works and where people have proven track records. I am sure there must be people making money with binary options (other than the brokers) but there is no evidence of it so why bother Trading trends works (most of the time - nothing works all of the time) there is ample evidence to prove and support it - just look at the various CTA and Hedge Funds results. So if that is true then surely its one way to go. My two cents worth - trends have become less long term as more people trade them so why not trade shorter term trends (intraday)? The big funds can't really do that because they manage too much money but you can.

Chose a decent trend following system - like this one and then milk the trends and cut the losses. Not rocket science and not 100% but it works. Finally, I think its good to be suspicious but as Nasap has not as yet given any reason to warrant it we should give him the benefit of the doubt and thank him for the time and effort he has certainly put in.

--- 帖子 #2066 ---
I would have to agree with vime and halfday. As a fly on the wall I have been trying to figure out how to trade this system. If you wait for all the stars to align you get in to late. If you take every signal you break even at best. In 4 months I have had 1 win week. The rest have been losers or break even.  There are many rules to this system and Nasap you don't seem to follow them and that is when you have success. There have been many questions in recent posts about how you decide what pair to trade or what you use to exit a trade. Seems every entry always different. I also don't get why Nasap you have to post "a clients" screen shot. We are now all very aware that you offer a mirror service since you have had 2 posts with reference to this. I see it as this. You have been challenged to hook up an explorer. You can do this very easy and not show vital information. If what you said is true then why not do it. Instead you post back a very harsh tirade about not being God fearing and asking for forgiveness. I retort with turn the other cheek.

--- 帖子 #2067 ---
Update:

I got out for a 2 pip gain on the AUD/USD trade. I have moved my stop on EUR/JPY to just above the trend line for those following along at home. I have locked in 100 pips and its tempting to take the 140 but no signals to take profit ( still below trend line ). The GBP trade is treading water so I have a stop just below the up trend line.

Have a good night.

--- 帖子 #2068 ---
Perhaps this is what people mean Nasap when we say we don't understand.

I have removed all other ind's so that the chart does not have so much noise. If you look at the screen shot for your trade on the gbp/usd the cloud isn't even the same. I tried to mark entries with red arrows and exits with yellow arrows. The result was 3 trades and a net of 92 pips not close to what you were able to get. This also assumes that a long trade was not taken when price broke the cloud after the second trade.  That trade would have been a 20 pip loser.  The trades are also only estimates of what someone would have gotten.

If you trade this system as written a trader will have many trades and lots of risk. So what we are all wondering is how do you not have so many trades and so little risk and a 100% batting average?

Are you using Win7?

--- 帖子 #2070 ---
This is my first trade with this method, so I am learning.

M2 made me wait all morning (UK).

By the time I got the M2 cross confirmation, Trix was oversold with red arrow and made me be very cautious.

Also price is near FPV.

I buy hoping for a bull pushup.

I am not used to Pallada VQI, it looks like the lines are very small but at least they are bigger and bigger.

I did also wait for the break of previous high.

I have all blocks with Early Signal TRUE, which I understand is the Agresive Mode.

Comment:  I normally trade Naked Charts with Mix Results, my comment is that trading this setup made me feel more relaxed, I am normally very worry about my entries, but here is easier to see where to stop in case it goes against my trade, as I did just crossing the Cloud and reenter later above Coral.

I came late to enter GU, I see a good entry at 1.6065 above Coral, above Cloud, Breakout confirmed, M2 crossing Coral, and this time Trix and VQI are align perfect. And of course blocks are blue.

By the way, that trade in EURJPJ Support at 131.139 rejected and then cross of Cloud, Nasap got that entry right, not need to wait for more confirmation. Well done

You are one out of ??? I don't know how many are watching this thread and still try to manage the system. Just after the post of your 1st trade I was thinking to tell you something about the M2 chart, but then I decided not to tell anything, because to much early. But now I am surprised! You got it. If I'm not totally mistaken, sometimes I am,  you will become a successful Trader on this system. Congrats!

Hi.. , Zokynho,  first sorry for my English..

i don't use EA version of Renko chart builder.   I use Indicator version.. modified by myself..

Original code taken from EA version ver 3.3 x2  so this Indicator version also capable to create 2 renko charts per indicator. and also because this is Indicator so u can add more than one instances in one standard candlestick M1 chart. and still working at weekend as long as your broker server active. this is the advantage of Indi version instead of EA version.

But u need more powerful CPU since this indi version consume more resources than ea version.

I also added 'starting price' option to lock the renko 'brick' so u can always get same position every time u re-open the offline chart.

Bellow is the parameters of this indicator;

StartingPrice     = 131;

(this is example for EURJPY)  u can change according to your selected pairs..  select round numbers for more good result)

RenkoBoxSize1     = 5.0;

(this is 'brick' size for 1st renko chart, since i change this from integer to double, so if you use 5 digit broker u can create  12.5 point brick size ..etc)

BoxShiftPercent1  = 50;

(this is the 'shifted' function, the example  'shifting' current renko brick 50% from previous brick up/down. / median renko.  but if u like geometrical trading  'shifted' 1/8 th of brick size will give you 'nearly' 45 / 315 degree angle.   for example : if you create 10 point brick size,  put 12.5 (%) for shifting value will give you 'smoothed' renko brick angle.  Again if you use 5 digit broker, u can 'shifted' less than 1 point/pip but maybe it will 'slowdown' your MT4 so be careful example:  BoxSize :5.0 and BoxShiftPercent :10 will give ypu  0.5 point step per brick )

RenkoTimeFrame1   = 2;

(well, i believe you already know this,  offline time frame for 1st renko chart)

RenkoBoxOffset1   = 0;

(this is old function for adjusting brick position, but since we use 'starting price',  keep the default 0).

ShowWicks1        = true;

(function to show or hide wick)

MaxBars1          = 10000;

(function to limit maximum brick per renko chart)

// setting for 2nd renko chart, same explanation with above

RenkoBoxSize2     = 10.0;

BoxShiftPercent2  = 50;

RenkoTimeFrame2   = 3;

RenkoBoxOffset2   = 0;

ShowWicks2        = true;

MaxBars2          = 10000;

EmulateOnLineChart= true;

(by default, will make offline chart alive with slight delay of course)

StrangeSymbolName = false;

(set to true if your broker pair names  different than standard pair name (symbol))

I share this renko chart builder  indicator 'as is' and at your own risk... ok.

hope it help

best regards..

Thanks Nasap, I want to be a good student.  You have put a great effort into teaching us.  By the way, I still think Newbies should start with the original Mihailo setup until they are profitable.  Your way of trading Nasap, incorporates Reversals, Support and Resistant Levels, TrendLines and Forex Basics that newbies are not ready yet for them.

You suggested to have different profiles for some pairs, but since I need to monitor and manage open trades, I need them all together.  So getting rid of M2 has freed some CPU.  Yesterday I only had 2 pairs on the screen, and now ... well, a lot.

I want to be able to close losing trades earlier than SL, and profitable trades at the last push if possible.

At the moment I have 2 trades opened, doing nothing for the last 3 hours.  I am really enjoying this template, I even went out for a walk, I am not worry at all, the SL are well positioned, are small, and price on both pairs on the right side of the Coral.  And even if I lose on these ones, it`s fine, part of the training.

Thanks Kiads for sharing, I will focus on Nasap setup until consistently profitable.

Hi guys, yesterday I had to keep my trades running the whole day and still in the late evening did not hit target. That was not realy satisfying! Therefore I decided to take more risk on less Pips. I guess this is good decision until the debate about the debt limit in the US has finished. This are my trades for today, each with a 15 Pip profit, thus I am already done for today!

Not much left for London Session.

Big moves overnight.

I had 2 small losses yesterday, left the trades running while sleeping.

I can see clearly the opposite signals, so I would have earn a lot of pips if I were working during night.

Asia Session rocks!!!

To Mara1... try installing MT4 on C:>,  but not inside Programs, just on C:   That way Windows doesn`t interfere and manage it.

Because I am learning this method, I am posting my losses, with reason why I entered those trades.

Hi Kickme,

I noticed that you are using a "smoothed version" of the Renko chart. Which indicator/EA are you using to generate these charts? Could you please share?

Also you have an indicator that colors the candles Red/Blue. I noticed that it's a commercial indicator. Could you please share the name of this indicator so I can look to purchase it too?

Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #2098 ---
Not good day for me, opened trades inside ranges and got bitten 8 times in a row.  Not much action between 8am until 7pm, bet I was bored.

I wasn`t in the mood to enter the big spikes at 7pm on FOMC Meeting Minute News (like Mara1)

I realized this template is very difficult to trade News, price goes to places were it doesn`t show an HA Bar, due to Renko creating them.

Also with the 7pm spikes, suddenly you see 5-6 new blocks at once.  And they take some few seconds to appear on screen due to EA working on Renko Bars.

I also realize my SL based on previous high/low are not really valid since here I am missing some points.

I also stop and reverse a couple of times, just to see price coming back to were it was on the first place.

Very dissappointing day for -100 aprox.

Trading real money is a lot more difficult than watching pictures of perfect setups

Questions for Nasap

1. I have being trying to place my SL behind previous high / low, as near as I can, 30 pips away in some pairs, about 45 pips away in JPY pairs.  Is that what you do?

2. Do you always place Target Price for a portion of the position?  Some of your exits seem to be inch perfect. Today I missed a profit of 30 just because of greed, I wanted more.

3. I understand you stop and reverse on opposite signal, right?  Because you said that Initial Stop is hardly never touched. Do you refer to a higher timeframe to make the decision of reversing or just reverse quick based on the signal on this M3 Chart?

4. For exits again:

After about 30 pips into profits, if you exit manually (you used to do it) what is best...

a) Trix change color

b) See 1M chart

c) Wait for cross of Cloud / Coral

d) Previous High/Low

I understand you wait for opposite signal for your last portion, but I am not sure about the 2 first other portions.  I know you are using a trade manager but I don`t understand the logic behind to replicate manually.

5. Do you wait for blocks with right color to enter into a trade?

I did wait for them, but later I noticed the color disappear or even change to other color.  Because of the wait, I ended buying and selling at very bad levels in some cases, but also saved me of a wrong signal where price continue the previous trend.

On the other hand, I know this is a trending strategy, and therefore those colors are supposed to protect me.  I don`t fully get it now having traded for real in a ranging day.

6. Do you determine TREND or RANGE condition looking at something on this template ?  Or do you use a higher timeframe for that?

I thought I got this system right, but today I have all this bunch of questions and a bad day behind me.  I am still learning it. Very optimistic of course.

Have you considered adding your own filters?

For example, when your renko system gives you a short or long signal, you could use a currency strength indicator as a confirmation.

So you'll check on this indicator and you would only be taking a short GBPUSD trade

when the USD is the strongest and GBP is the weakest as was the case yesterday.

Have a look at the ICSM  indicator

I don't know if it will fit on your template because it sits on the bottom left hands side of the screen

but you could have it running on a separate chart
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...38#post6979538

The other thing to consider is key structural levels and daily range.

If the market has already moved a lot for the day, it has broken through a couple of key structural levels

and is is a approaching 1 more key structural level, it is now weakening and it is less likely that it will break through to the next level.

Do some homework before you enter a trade so you have the odds on your side and you should be right.

--- 帖子 #2102 ---
Hi, Keno   this is the dis-advantage of modified offline chart. because it will 'visualized' after at least 2 step,  write the data to a file and read it to build that 'renko (renga) candle/bar (brick).   Heiken Ashi in the other hand, actually the 'way' to bridging between Japanese Standard Candlestick chart and Japanese Renga (renko) Brick chart. So u can see  'renko' in Standard Candlestick Chart.

Putting HA on Renko Chart will 'add'  another 1 step to visualize price movement.   Bigger box size of renko will also 'delay' the visualization, since HA didn't receive any data before the chart builder create new brick/bar.

Use of Renko chart or other 'price base' chart maybe good if you use geometrical trading system.  trend lines, Fibonacci or any system that generally watching HH LL HL LH.

Use of any 'averaging' calculation tools, maybe less effective since 'renko' itself also averaging tool base on price range (box size). Any averaging tools / indicators will look perfect in renko chart history, but tell you nothing in real time.

hope it help

best regards..

hello

waths wrong here

osma,cci,fim etc not same ,and why? eur/usd

--- 帖子 #2104 ---
Thanks for comments.

Just entered a BUY on EURUSD, and checking on Currency Strength makes sense.  EUR stronger than USD at the moment, which gives me confidence.  Also EUR news are behind.

About Structural Levels, I will need more explanation to work out that.

What I did today is on a Daily chart 21 EMA to show me a long term trend (21 days is about a month), and 5 EMA to show me Momentum (5 days is a week) and right now we are in a retracement in EURUSD.

Apart from that, I don`t know how to see more structure.

--- 帖子 #2105 ---
Hi Again Keno...

Please.. check your Currency Strength Meter calculation code.. then you will know that high number at that strength meter 'meaning' the price 'already' move that far.. base on 100 point measurement..

for example according to your Currency Strength Meter at that moment  EUR is strongest and JPY is weakest, at this point, EURJPY already up for several hours.

so it is not wise to go long with EJ, and maybe better if we wait JPY move from 8 to 7 (stronger) and EUR from 1 to 2 (weaker) at that Currency Strength Meter, to start looking Short opportunity with EJ.

I hope i can explained better but sorry for my English..

best regards..

Judging from your coral you don't have enough data points

--- 帖子 #2108 ---
Kiads ,

Is that a pic of your trading Station ??

If it is are you using a detach chart program for your mt4 ?

why not?

coral tauch and all other are in blue so up trend or Im wrong?

--- 帖子 #2110 ---
Hi All,

You're welcome.

The thread is getting livelier by the day. Good to see.

I’m experimenting a lot with this system and honestly –as nasap pointed out and keno refers to it – these 4 histograms don’t do much good. Personally I don’t use them anymore. I like to use the trix indi though. I think that its way too underrated. When the faster trix line crosses the slower one and they are the same color that’s a pretty strong signal for me. Works very well.

I had the first „more than 100 pips” winning trade the other day for the first time and I’m becoming more consistent with my winners. I’m happy about it. Still have a lot to learn of course.

keno,

This is just one newbie to the other:

I think that you should filter out false signals more. Not every signal is a good one. Coral is a great tool to identify a ranging market. You can learn much from the candles themselves too.

For example:

Here you can see a lot of renko dojis (I’m using box size 7 with median renko + HA):

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

As I observed, you can recognize signs of decreasing selling potential. Look at how PA is getting more hesitant downwards. After the second break of the coral it’s a definate buy for me. And I did just that. Maybe it won’t work out. That’s when your money and risk management have to kick in. I mean losing a 100 pips within a day suggests that you should exit those trades way sooner and shouldn’t overtrade either.

I don’t want to be a smartass because I don’t have the right and experience to be one. These are just my observations.

PS.: using HA with renko candles and wicks works for me pretty well. Renko candles  - by themselves -don’t show when PA is hesitant but if you use them with wicks and toss HA on them, they can hold a lot more valuable information

Regards and good luck!

ok just thot I saw the way coral painted on your chart it showed me insufficient data points

anyway  to get more points    on m1 chart  you can use ctrl home and let it collect data

Thats one way

Kiads,

Thanks for reply.

--- 帖子 #2115 ---
Good point Harada,    my charts don`t show wicks,   I am changing that to TRUE right now.

Mara1, always check if there are news before placing the trade.  You asked about GBP USD 5 minutes before the news, and price moved 20pips on the news, it`s difficult to guess in which direction is going to go.

--- 帖子 #2116 ---
Hey Kiads,

Can you please share your indies tpl and explanations how are you using your method?

You can PM me if you don't want to confuse people.I like your renko charts and playing with it but still didn't find something good.

Regards

--- 帖子 #2117 ---
Very nice observations.

Much earlier in thread I mentioned the M2 i dont use. Really no need.  Over cautious

The blocks are fine but not really needed. I dont use them

The coral is nice but u put on a macd and u get as good a filter.

I've also done away with HA.  Just median renko . Enough price structure there to trade.

I've always subscribed that simple indis is all thats needed . and its just confirmation thats all

Oh lastly I dont even use the cloud.

But good PA observations.

--- 帖子 #2118 ---
Hi.. , uh mostly i don't use any 'show me the way' kind of indicators.. in my renko charts just renko bricks formation itself and sometimes trendlines (Equidistant Channel). , Round Number marker (Sweet Spot), and my 'eyes' ...

my previous post picture just to show you how to combine renko and ichi cloud, but 'what' , 'why' and 'how' to 'read'  kumo.. maybe too difficult to explained just in 1 or 2 posts.. lol

anyway..  if you just want 'that' picture template.. and indicators, here we go..

hope it helps

Charts looking nice but think that with your renko settings is too fast to follow few pairs.What settings would you recommend for longer brick size?

Regards,

Zokynho

--- 帖子 #2122 ---
I only use 5 point brick at M2 with 10% shift (0.5 point increment) and 10 point brick at M3 also with 10% shift (1 point increment).

If some pairs hv more higher daily average.. let say 150 point average per days, you can use 15 point brick with 10% shift (1.5 point increment) but as we know, with bigger brick/box size, we will 'late' to see turning point.  For 5 point brick size, at least price already 'move' more than 10 point, so for 15 point brick size u need price to move around 30 point in opposite direction to visualize the turning point..

I hope u understand my explanation

best regards..

--- 帖子 #2123 ---
Yes Kiads all clear,

how are you handling more than one pair?

Regards

--- 帖子 #2124 ---
I started looking at pairs that have wider daily ranges in hopes of getting more pips and being able to trade less. Good movement on Yen pairs. EUR/JPY ranging nicely this week Locked for 100 manual 20 pip trailing stop.  GBP/JPY 110 locked manual 25 pip trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #2125 ---
I only trade 1 or 2 pairs, in my personal opinion, no need to trade alot of pairs.. as long as you can catch almost all the waves up or down..

for reducing the 'slowdown effect' from renko builder indi, I use several copy of MT4, every MT4 handle only 1 pair.

another clue..,  try to put EC (Equidistant Channel) like this bellow example picture (EU  RC 5 point brick 10% shift)

maybe it will surprise you.. lol

--- 帖子 #2129 ---
I have traded gold in the past with no success. Never with Renko don't really want to go down that road again  really don't want to go down that road again. I wouldn't mind mining for it sometime maybe get my own reality show. Has anyone seen Jungle gold? Those guys are the biggest scammers I have ever seen.

Has anyone tried Renko with gold or silver I would think those markets almost move to fast for it to be effective?

--- 帖子 #2131 ---
Hello thanks for posting my questions would be how does a wick show when PA is being hesitant?  Why would you take the second break of the coral as an entry and not the first. Did you pass on the trade when price broke the coral the first time and why?

In hind sight its perfect to want to trade the way you describe but unrealistic advice. In the real world you have no idea where price will go after it broke the coral the first time so to pass on it without rules or ignore based on a hunch isn't trading but instead gambling and of no use.

--- 帖子 #2132 ---
Hi,

I don’t know how many hours you spend in front of charts or how long you have been trading but after a while there are patterns you recognize. Price started out lower under the coral the first time. When that happens, a lot of times it bounces back from it or goes only one or two candles above it. By the the next time the coral adjusted itself with that first peak and price started to move up from little above the coral. I saw this playing out just like this before. That’s also a reason why I traded the second run upwards.

As I said nothing is sure but that’s why you must have solid money management and experience as well. Recognizing patterns and getting to know PA better and better is essential regardless of the system you use...

regards,

Harada

I have been trading gold with Renko for a while. You need to have a larger renko box than usual (I work with a 10 pips box, ie something like 1301 to 1302 USD). This one dollar can be 10, 100 or even 1000 pips according to hw many digits your broker is using. I trade with Oanda, and I set the Renko EA to 1000 pips per box.

Try with a large number as pips per box and work downwards because a small number of pips per renko box will cause your MT4 to freeze.

You may need to change your settings probably, but you will have to see that as you go along. I like gold because it gives me the chance to recover even after 1-2 failures.

Is Break Even a good choice here ?  Or should I just grab some profits now?

GBP/JPY stopped out for 144 I missed the additional 3 trades. EUR/JPY still going locked 156 in with stop below the line.

--- 帖子 #2136 ---
The answer to your problems are right in your post and the quote above.

You cant trade if you don't have a plan for the trade. Know here your stops are, have an exit strategy. Know what your risk is and commit to losing it. BE happy when you get some pips no matter how small the win. Don't trade on a hunch or your gut or feelings.

In the trade above what are the reasons you should close the trade list them out on a piece of paper. Now list the reason you should hold the trade. Which list is bigger? That's your answer.

--- 帖子 #2137 ---
Thanks KickMe

That`s my weakest point, emotions once in the trade.  I did plan it, but it didn`t go very well as I predicted and that brings emotions into play

Anyway, Renko charts are helping to stay longer.

FYI.

For some of you wondering, Nasap is so quiet at the moment..

As you know, if you are branded as commercial member, from then, you can post only in the commercial section (can you ?),

but not here any more..

So the congrats go to the halfdaytrader, you achieved your goal and killed this thread.

Hope you are happy now and will continue Nasaps work, post trades, help members with the configuration

and other stuff and keep this thread alive ? Will you ?

Thanks again and have a nice life,

you saved us from Nasap and now we can continue without the evil Nasap Influence..

Thank you so much, have a nice day..

--- 帖子 #2140 ---
I am going through all of Nasaps posts again, there is so much experience.

She started trading this method as described on page 1 (in May this year)

Then she tested and defined specific target profits for each pair.  Also Best Trading times.  She was doing fine, some winners, some losers.

Then she tested many different indicators, different settings.

And after some very few months she became so successful that she was almost getting 100 % winners with some break even, but not big losers.

It is a shame that if you become successful, and then want to trade other people money (maybe friends), you can not be helping others.

Just happened when I was starting to learn and practice this system.  Very sad.

I haven`t seen any post from her trying to get money.  That link mentioned to a commercial company selling the administration of trades, I can`t link that to Nasap.  She was honestly answering questions, honestly because she did automate her trading using this tools.  She did also provided links (very useful) like the trenline EA, which I downloaded for free.  PAlladaVQI as well for free.

--- 帖子 #2141 ---
Actually yes I am. The moderators do not just label someone commercial because of one post. There is nothing stopping Nasap from continuing the thread in the commercial section if he truly is interested in "helping people". Nasap never posted the same chart twice and always had new indicators. A simple question about how he managed his trades and he posted a link to a commercial platform. Asked to provide proof of his trades and he posts a "clients" screen shot and mentions how his client is out but HE is still in. No one here could duplicate any trade he ever made meaning that if you really wanted those results you would need to have him trade it for you. HE was asked multiple questions on how he picked his trades and managed them. His responses were vague with answers such as "it really depends on the pair and the trader" Really?????? His rules were vague if they exist at all.

The big clue that he was trolling for clients came when someone else started having success and he posted that they were just trying to hijack a thread and asked them to leave. It was pointed out that the trade he "did my way" was not traded according to the system rules or with indicators everyone could use. Because at that point if others can out do him he won't get clients will he? So he posts a trade that gets more pips with of course his own indicator on the charts. After which came the rip that he has been approached by multiple people to trade for them but he didn't accept.

Why the "client" reference he really couldn't just post his own account history?

So yes I am very happy that he is branded. I have nothing against commercial vendors, I really don't. John Bollinger, Bill Williams, Gann they all went commercial along withy many others who's indicators are traded everyday by millions . Yes they gave them away but they made millions off the books. So there is a place for commercial vendors and I am finding that the free stuff really isn't very time efficient and many times not worth the effort.  What I don't like is those that troll under the guise of helping people when they are really setting them up to fail so they can sweep in and save the day, for a fee of course.

keno is an example(not picking on you) he/she is trading the system and cant duplicate the success. In fact it isn't clear as day and cut and dry like Nasap pointed said is it?  I think there is one other poster who lost 100 pips in 1 day.

If you learned so much why don't you take it over. My bet is you cant because he didn't have a system anyone here could use because he wasn't going to "share all his secrets" but I bet he would for a fee.

Halfdaytrade.......

It seems you have ruffled a few feathers,,,  But I agree with everything you say. Posting a screenshot of a clients trade is hardly subtle way to attract paying customers

--- 帖子 #2143 ---
OMG...  too bad.. , someone not learning basic principle of this great tools..  and only expected instant shortcut 'manual book' completely free.. from an angel.. ?

Please.. learn the whole knowledge, and you can create your own free system..,  but remember not to use only half brain or more worse half heart to do that.. lol.

Have a good time and good manner too...

--- 帖子 #2144 ---
Halfdaytrade.......  please don`t use my name to justify your silly comments.  What you did is absurd and ridiculous, and saying something so silly like I was trading this system is not true.  That was my second day of trading, it was a ranging and boring day, and I did enter some silly trades and I did not enter the ones that came later on the same day and they gave nice profits.

In order to trade profitable I need to learn to trade price Action.  Any template, any system on this forum, is just to confirm your own trading based on price action.  Nasap has been trading successfully, not because of this system, instead because she can recognize price action.  And that is why KickMe gets good results as well, just trading the Renko Bars.

Have you ever traded successfully.  Because I can`t find any constructive comment coming from you.  You have been asking Nasap for those perfect and secret indicators she was testing.  That`s so absurd.

And complaining because she trades for some other people.  Did you see the positions were 0.3 ?  I would hardly call that a big account, therefore she doesn`t get big commissions.  I dream the day I become consistent and somebody can trust me with their money.  Probably some friends or family.

Why you want her to prove to you that she trades real money in her real account?  She doesn`t owe you anything

This whole thing you started is so absurd.  It is so hard to find somebody who trades well and willing to teach for free.

Instead of you, I want to thank Nasap for her contributions.  And also for her patience to deal with people asking the same silly questions all the time.  She didn`t create this system, she was just trading it and improving it. She did spent time getting better and better, and trying to share.

She wasn`t selling pallada, she posted it for free.  She didn`t sell the Trades Manager, she just answer a question explaining how she is trading.  She didn`t sell you the TrendLine EA, we all downloaded that for free.

How did you know Nasap was a she?

Again this has nothing to do with me being successful or not and for the record I am not a successful trader. Hopefully some day I will be. Read my post I have no problem with commercial vendors. There is a place on this forum for that.  As for kickme I don't believe he/she is trading this system and has at least posted the reason for the trades so other can learn and was asked to leave by Nasap.

I also take offense to the fact that I am a mean hearted, spirited, bitter person. I don't think I am at all. I am actually successful in other areas of my life and very happy with my lot in life. I didn't banish Nasap the moderators decided after looking at the posts that they were not done according to the rules. I will say again and I am sure she is reading this, if Nasap is so interested in helping people she can start a thread in the commercial section. I believe she won't since commercial members cant PM or get PM's which would greatly cut down on fishing for clients.

Have wonderful week.

nah.. that my previous post is only joke my friend Mara1,  just to tease someone.. lol.   to give him a lesson that if nice contributor like Nasap don't want to share all of her system and only part of it for free, but it is also really valuable to us..  we don't need to get mad and accused her for something that doesn't make sense at all..

Today, 2 trades EU buy +15 pips and buy GU +27. The week begin good.

--- 帖子 #2154 ---
3 Trades, 3 winners

GBPUSD  + 30 pips

USDCHF  + 34 pips

EURUSD  + 20 pips

Still too many questions on how long should I hold the positions when they go against.  Nasap was holding for 50 pips SL, and never reversing.   I decided last week to hold for only 35 pips SL, and I got burned.   Even when I reversed.  Nobody has really answered me.

The only answer I got was that I need to see the structure of the price, and I have not idea how to do that.

Therefore this 3 GOOD trades today and the BAD trades last week, I see no difference, is it just pure LUCK they touch TP or SL ?

--- 帖子 #2155 ---
Maybe it is long and winding road to understand the whole market structure and price structure..

but if you use renko maybe just watch HH LL HL LH formations..

Hey Keno, nice trade yesterday. Right now I trade on 4 box pips with SL 14 pips (3x4+spread).  It is true that the question of exit trade is hard. I am using BBand stop 7;2 for help. I short GU right now, stopped by SL -14 pips

--- 帖子 #2157 ---
Thanks Kiads.

So just trading Renko with Price Structure is giving you nice setups.  But it is not the idea behind Mihailo and Nasap trades, because they trade the Momentum of the movement.

They wait until the movement has gained momentum, which is shown by GoldenFinger, PalladaVQI, and all 4 Boxes.

But sometimes the momentum dies, even reverses, and they posted pictures where they just hold until eventually reached TP without touching SL.  I feel there is lot of luck there.

I can see in your trades, specially the GBPUSD that you are trading channels, taking the long term trend and buying at the best possible price at the bottom of that channel, then you even hold the position during the big correction and move the stop loss below the V correction.

With USDCHF the same.  You bought at the best possible price and just hold it. with a SL below the V correction.

Nice, that is a long term winning strategy.  Maybe we should end this Mihailo template and trade channels.  Mihailo template is useless to trade the way you do.

Anyway, thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #2158 ---
Aha.., i think u start to catch the basic principle of renko.. , maybe u already know that renko can be described generally as 'zig-zag with a better view'

and you can always 'see' what is that we called 'momentum' without any indicator. just 'watch' series of top and bottom formations.. more closer the formations.. it will tell you that something will happen soon..  (just like 'squeeze'  at BB).

And about how i manage my trade look at this example picture bellow.. just as simple as that..

--- 帖子 #2159 ---
That is a beautiful setup for a short trade.  That picture should be framed, I can see price structure at last.

Risk/Reward = good trade.

I would say that you trade swings.  Swing trader.

Now... how do you guess there is a swing coming ?  Did you just take the break of that resistance when prices where coming down (your entry match that resistance/ new support level)  ?    Or in other words,  how did you know that is not going to bounce and continue higher ?

--- 帖子 #2160 ---
Honestly, I don't really know.. lol, that why there is some calculated Risk involve right..

Question:  In M1 my Renko Box Size is defined to 5

In M2 I can "see"  Renko Candles of 5 pips

When I "see" M3, the Heiken Ashi candles are 13 pips long.

Oprad, what do you mean by 4 pips boxes ?

Because since I have 13 pips candles, I can`t really use 14 pips SL.

--- 帖子 #2162 ---
Thanks Kiads for sharing.

I will have to train my eyes to see that in old charts.  First time I hear that theory of the Strong Push.

I have seen people guessing swing zones based on MAs, Fibonacci Levels, Pivots, and confluence of different indicators in the same area.

I wasn`t expecting something so easy to see visually like your explanation.

So you just take the reversal blindly, just because it gives a good Risk/Reward Ratio.  If that is the case you would be LONG right now on that same graph you posted, it did break the support (previous low at 1.3485) and now is trading above it.

I have seen people looking at the difference between the High of the last swing, and the internal high/low, what you call HL and LH.

--- 帖子 #2163 ---
Not yet,... please check my previous post picture of EU,  i put lime color horiz line as a 'watch line' , so as long as price don't 'break' that line (meaning my renko lollipop current candle should entirely above that line). I'm not change my direction..

It already happen like that before.. (price don't break my previous watch line)

hello mara is it possible for you to post your charts so that we might learn from your success. In light of recent posts I am not looking for a free ride or easy way to learn this system. I am trying to learn as I have been struggling to get any type of profit.

Regards and good luck

--- 帖子 #2169 ---
Could I ask how you deal with the repainting nature of the regression bands. In previous experiments with them I found they are great to look at but didn't do much live as they react after the fact. I haven't tried the indicator you posted yet. Did you make any modifications?

--- 帖子 #2170 ---
This is off topic. That's a very impressive and simple Renko trading method. I trade in a similar way but with different indicator but the problem is sudden reversals. Am currently working on a way to apply currency strength or trend bias to reduce whipsaws.

--- 帖子 #2171 ---
Hi, the question is, do you know how to use this regression channel and what to look for ?

Generally sometimes i need this RegChannel to find out where is the middle of the curve.. to put my parallel trendlines (Equidistant Channel), so actually i really need that repainting nature of this RegChannel  to watch the last curve forming

Hey Kickme

Could you describe a little more about your system?

I found something similar SMC4Scalper Candles indicator but how you use it?

Do you search for renko paterns as pointed out?

--- 帖子 #2177 ---
Euro stopped out for 117 GBP still going

--- 帖子 #2178 ---
I buy on blue and sell on red the system is not mine I got it from Calstar.  I have the SMC candles but they continually repaint and I could never get that solved.  I think they are based on the trix indicator and plot the trix itself as a candle if that helps? Sorry I cant help you more but I don't use them. Regarding patterns the only one I use is a trend line which has proven for me and others in the thread to be very useful.

--- 帖子 #2179 ---
So it definitely looks like the indicator that Kickme is using is either exactly SMC4Scalper or something very similar to it. Attached is the indicator that I found off the internet with the settings that produced very similar candle coloring. BUT the Renko chart that Kickme is using is very different from the regular Renko charts that we build with RenkoLiveChart EA. Perhaps Kickme wants to help us out by sharing his chart making EA instead of showing off all the pips he makes  hehe

Anyways, hope this helps out someone. Play with the settings until you get a good setting for each pair.

--- 帖子 #2180 ---
saverO thanks for sharing.

The Renko I am using is not mine to share as I posted many posts back. The indicator is the design of Calstar. It is compiled and when I was going to decompile it I lost it and had to beg to get it back. If you want the indicator I would simply contact him. He has a trading group and I happen to know that the indicator is being traded by others on this forum with great success. I am posting here mostly as a journal and perhaps given that I now get at least 5 negative crappy PM's a day should move on to another thread. My point in my posts is that you do not need indicators to trade Renko. In fact you shouldn't be using any at all. Price action trading is just that Price action trading. When you add indicators you clog it all up and are more likely to screw it up then pump it up. There is no grail boys and girls only tales of such.

--- 帖子 #2181 ---
100% correct..  and you can't achieved that  in half-day Webinar about PA..

Can we all just quit )(&*^ slapping one another and concentrate on helping each other. I admit I got jealous and my actions may have cost others that's now my cross to carry. The amount of time spent on these forums cutting on those who are successful is incredible. Kickme showed that you don't need indicators and had a few posts with how to trade. If I had the discipline I would try trading just the darn bars no colors filters nothing. I should probably send a sorry to Nasap as well. We have it rolling here again with some new indicators and some promise for those that need the help and lets be honest if any of us were remotely successful we wouldn't be hanging out here. We would be kicking it on a beach with a Corona and lime.

Yes, sometime it happen like that if your feeder chart (standard M1), get mismatch data from your broker (too much volatility in seconds)..

Right click on your feeder chart and refresh it then open your renko chart builder indicator (without editing anything) may solve the problem..

Hope it help

And for my friend who ask me, how I set up my trading ,  well usually i just trading one pair, and mostly crosser like EURJPY or CHFJPY.

I use my shifted renko and also range bar chart (for comparison) as 2 main windows chart, and 2 smaller windows with std candlestick chart for 2 majors related with the crosser in my main chart, and 1 smaller window with std candlestick chart for the crosser itself just like the example picture bellow.

I read these thread since a lot of time. I have been following it and never say nothing, because I was doing research and investigation enough to make my own system and template.

First, I want to say a big "thank you" to Mihailo, Nasap, and every person who has shown us various templates and systems. On the other hand, I want to remember to everyone who reads me that the "holy grail" and the "perfect system" doesn't exist and if you want to understand a system you MUST do some research.

This is my template, it is based on this thread but I think it's pretty simple.

I am not finished it, I'm still doing more research, but it's good enough to make some profitable pips.

My rules:

BUY when:

- Trix is completely blue and behind zero line.

- Heiken Ashi opens over Ichimoku cloud

- Pallada is blue and the Doda-Stochastic in the same window is touching 80 level with the green line and it's open in an uptrend.

SELL when:

- Trix is completely red and over zero line.

- Heiken Ashi opens behind Ichimoku cloud

- Pallada is red and the Doda is touching 20 level with the green line and it's open and showing us a downtrend.

EXIT when:

- Doda's alarm tell us that the trend is going to change.

Please, share your opinions about it (and excuse me if my english is not good enough).

generally the methodology is the same like original renko described before?

... and what time do you trade?

--- 帖子 #2232 ---
When we use renko, we don't use timeframe, the renko offline charts generated by the EA in m1 timeframe are the same whatever the timeframe of the renko offline chart you want to use, that is to say, the offline chart in m4 looks exactly like the offline renko chart in m3 or in m2. As a consequence, when we use renko charts we only see the price action, not the time, and I think it doesn't matter, because if I have to stay in a trade 3 hours or 30 hours I don't mind, if the system is profitable.

On the other side, I use 10 pips renko boxes for almost all the pairs, except the JPY ones, where I trade with 15 pips renko boxes, this size is good enough for me because I "see" better the chart and I don't "feel" so much "noise". My SL is always on the other side of Ichimoku cloud and now that I'm starting to feel more and more confident with this system I usually stay in the trade till the change of color in the Trix slow line, because I think it tells me the major trend, but if you're not confident enough, you can exit when the doda tells you, at first cross against the trend.

If anybody has any doubt, please don't be shy!!!

Pips for all! Casyo.

P.S: Still doing research... , hope to share the results soon with all of you!!!

--- 帖子 #2233 ---
I'll post pictures in this thread because the pictures strategies use Renko charts. Please maybe someone can help identify indicators used to snimka nA maybe someone can share the whole strategy. You will appreciate not just me.

--- 帖子 #2234 ---
I don't really know which are those indicators. But, your pictures gave me a wonderful idea!

I am performing a beautiful and simple system based in renko, MACD, Mihailo's rules,... When I say it, it can look complicated, but the system is really really simple. Of course, at first, I'm going to test it in demo. I suggest all of you to do the same.

I'll post the system here, because it use Mihailo's rules, at the end of the weekend.

Pips for all! Casyo.

--- 帖子 #2235 ---
Hi,

yes I know that we don't use time-frames in renko

I mean what time during a day do you trade, it would be important to catch nice enters

--- 帖子 #2236 ---
Sorry, I didn't understand your question in the right way. I usually trade during the London session and the start of American session, when the volume is higher and the spreads decrease...the start of the American session is difficult to trade sometimes for me, because it is my "siesta" time.

So, I trade from 8:00 GMT to 17:00 GMT but I'm not always in front of my PC! Pallada's alarm tells me when I must be near the computer.

--- 帖子 #2237 ---
From my point of view, when an arrow or a dot tells you the exact point to exit or enter in a trade, that is to say, when something looks too good to be true, it's because it's too good to be true and it repaints.

On the other side, you can google most of the indis used in those pictures:

-In the first one, the indicator in the bottom are the histogram for Heiken Ashi and the TrendWave

-In the second one, you have a channel...maybe based in donchian with very low settings, the green and red arrows looks like Inwmarrows with the settings (3,3,3,3), and the blue arrows looks like Doda Stochastic arrows with very little settings, maybe (4, 6.5, 4.5) or something like that and finally the last indicator in the bottom is like one I know...the value chart.

Maybe these indicators aren't the correct ones, but they look similar.

If you want them magistr91 or you don't find them, just say it and I will upload most of them...I think I have them but I have to look for.

And yes, I am a mathematician...that's my job!!! So I usually calculate settings with special care.

As always, excuse me for my terrible English and pips for all!!!

Casyo.

hi

can anyone advise shall i short UJ ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #2243 ---
Short? If you are following Nasap's rules, you can't go short at that moment, for two reasons:

-The first one: you haven't the 13-bricks in red.

-The second one and most important: in M2 your renko bricks are not below the coral.

I remember all of you Nasap's rules:

To take a short position:

- The four colored bricks named by 13... in red.

- Renko bricks below the coral and the Ichimoku

- Renko bricks in M2 below the coral, too.

- Pallada's alarm.

The same rules but in accordance, for a long position.

--- 帖子 #2244 ---
hi casyo,

thanks. I have try your template. i have some queries on buy/sell rules.

BUY when:

- Trix is completely blue and behind zero line. ( Is it two trix lines has to cross up the zero line?)

- Heiken Ashi opens over Ichimoku cloud

- Pallada is blue and the Doda-Stochastic in the same window is touching 80 level with the green line and it's open in an uptrend.

SELL when:

- Trix is completely red and over zero line. ( Is it two trix lines has to cross below the zero line?)

- Heiken Ashi opens behind Ichimoku cloud

- Pallada is red and the Doda is touching 20 level with the green line and it's open and showing us a downtrend.

How many pairs are u trading now?

--- 帖子 #2245 ---
Now trading 8 pairs.

Still with demo account, but I think soon I will open a real account.

About your questions... it's enough when the fast trix is crossing the red or the green dotted line, red for sell, green for buy, you know what I mean?

--- 帖子 #2246 ---
Another trick...note that when the Pallada calls you to buy or sell and the green stochastich it's overbought or oversold before the call, it can be a failed trade, cause momentum is exhausted. This doesn't mean, of course, that all that kind of trades will fail, but I think it's a good filter.

--- 帖子 #2247 ---
Anyone know about the indicator installed in the lower window of the chart?

--- 帖子 #2248 ---
The indicator and system as I am very sure you already know or you wouldn't have the screen shot is called hama pad. It is also a commercial system and has multiple versions FX cruiser developed it and the current version has the histogram you are asking about. Last I checked fx cruiser was not selling it or allowing new members to his group. newer versions would repaint as with the one that I posted but did show promise.

--- 帖子 #2249 ---
Here is one more Image.

i would like to know if there is not version of 4 boxes ( 13 stochastic,etc ) with alert ?

because on indices pallada doesn't work so i remove it and i've no audio alert and i can't look each second all the indices of course,

Here you are...I've found it recently in another forum. Please, read the code and try to understand how it works, if you have any problem I can translate it. We must say thanks to the programmer!!! It includes in the alarm all 13 blocks and Pallada.

NASAP_13 OsMA i MACD

NASAP_13 FIM

NASAP_13 Stochastic

NASAP_13 CCI

I put.

--- 帖子 #2259 ---
Don't worry, I trade from one year old netbook with only 1Gb RAM (yes, it was cheap!!! ) and those arrows works properly. First, you must make sure to edit the indicator and put 100 bars on the settings.  Tell me how it works.

C ya!!!

Casyo.

--- 帖子 #2260 ---
Kristina, your words have made me really happy.

Tomorrow I'll start with my live account . I'll try to post screenshots of my trades, even of my template and indicators (surprise! the arrows attached few post ago are one of them ). I don't mind to show you all I have, it is what I would like somebody do for me years ago.

On the other hand, I have a trick for all of you guys who have poor RAM like me... "divide and defeat" (I don't know if the translation is correct, my poor English...) that is to say, install more copies of the mt4, in different folders (add something to the folder's name when install to identify) for example: one for the Euro, another one for the GBP, ... , put in all of them the same account, look for the executable archive of the terminal and put manually the shortcut on your desktop, and finally put two or three charts only in every copy (I'm not sure if you know what I mean). In that way I trade with 8 currencies (eurusd, eurjpy, gbpusd, gbpjpy, usdchf, usdjpy, audusd, euraud).

Hope it helps!!!

Casyo.

--- 帖子 #2261 ---
oh i had 2000 for count bars, i will change that

edit : i've just changed for all pairs but memory doesn't change , yet 387000Ko for this terminal

(i've just 37% of my memory used)

i'm doing the same thing to test differents strategies, i've made 7copies of "terminal"

oh nice, i'll follow that with a lot of interest,

you'll begin with how many money and what money management ?

personally, i'm arriving to a so good set up so i will be happy to discuss of some trades' entries,etc with you to see if we are on the good way

--- 帖子 #2262 ---
Thank you thomasz1!!!

I'll begin with 2000€ and, at first 2 minilots for every trade.

My money management is exponential, the more I have the more I trade. When I reach 3000€, 3 minilots and so on. My SL is always according my new template...more or less between 10-20 pips and TP in the same way, my template tell me where it is but it usually is 20-40 pips every trade.

This is a very accurate system if you know how to use it. You can reach easily 100 pips per trading session, even 200 on good days.

I'll withdraw the 50% of my weekly profit. And ALWAYS move the SL to BE when I have 15 pips of profit (I am using 5 pips renko charts, 15 pips losses must be 2 renko bricks against the trade). You can use a trailing EA, and maybe reach more pips than me, but I prefer to do it manually and use scripts, I feel better doing things by myself. And don't forget: to be succesful in trading forex depends a lot, almost exclusively, on your confident in yourself, in your psicology.

--- 帖子 #2264 ---
you are using the biggest repainting indi' in this world ahah

zigzag and kind of " CHT_Value_Chart_..." that i've already tried but quickly left,

i really don't see what you find as qualities at these indicators but if you make pips with that that's the most important ^^

i will try to post some  trades too this week,

good night folks !

--- 帖子 #2265 ---
just made a quick profit on EUR/JPY ,Casyopea , did you have the same trade. This system is very good but you 'll strong internet and strong PC to trade a few favorite pairs

--- 帖子 #2266 ---
Since the zigzag repaints, are you using the dots to enter/exit or the arrows?

--- 帖子 #2267 ---
Today I couldn't trade, I have been doing other important things during the morning.

But, I love repaint indis!!! And I'm going to explain why. Market is always changing, and an indi that can repaint is an indi that can tell you more real information than a no-repaint indi which always gonna be late.

On the other hand, obviously you can't trust in a repaint indi, that can change at any moment to use it like an enter signal. So, I use the zig zag indicator to "see" the waves and the trend (of course, I love Elliott Waves Theory). I use the arrows to enter, but only with the trend. And the Tma envelope to exit. I think that resistance and support levels are dynamic, so I use the resistance and support level the Tma tells me in the moment I enter in the trade like an early exit. That's why I said a few post ago that you can use a Trailing EA, too. Trading, at the end, consist in feeling comfortable with your own style and do it on your own way, that's just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #2268 ---
Sorry... I forgot! One more thing! You can use the dots like SL if you want, or use a fixed 15 pips SL (15 pips are two renko bricks against your trade).

I would like to read what do you think about all these things and learn with your suggestions!!!

Regards.

Casyo.

--- 帖子 #2269 ---
Appreciate your help.  What are is the TMA envelope?

You refer to zigzag in your recent post... but I do not see it in this template...

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #2276 ---
zigzag are the suns

@casyopea > why you've left the 4 boxes ( 13 osma macd,etc ) ?

for me it's a really good indicator which combined with some others gives a nice set up

but for removals of coral and ichimoku ( and even pallada which can be easily replaced by others ) i totally agree

--- 帖子 #2277 ---
Thanks thomas.!!

--- 帖子 #2282 ---
ahah ok ^^ that's the heavy talked about indicator

will try soon to re-use it

you take all your trades against the trend ( direction of candles on your graphes i mean )  , no problem but in this case why put the TPs so far from entries ?

a TP at the green mediane would be more logical or at least above/below  High/low which create support/resistance , no ?

even if you believe a new trend is starting, nothing forbids you to re enter after the little retracement

--- 帖子 #2283 ---
Hi

How come I never see or hear the alert sound when an arrow appears even though I installed everything.

Anyway, this is a very good system though a bit repainting.The arrows sometimes  appear late.

I suugest to focus on European and US sessions when there is enough volatility

--- 帖子 #2284 ---
I see you use http://forex4live.com/ indi

cna you tell mee arrows repaint?

reg

--- 帖子 #2285 ---
Dear mara1, these guys are a totally scammers!!! Don't trust in them!!! These indis where available for free a few years ago, they renamed and sold them.

I don't know if the arrows they use repaint or not, arrows in my template were found in other forum and they use Nasap's blocks. Like the Nasap's blocks once the arrow appears and the candle is closed, it doesn't repaint. Sometimes it appears later, but I don't know how to fix the problem.

However, the "suns" indi repaints, and you mustn't to use it alone for entry, because it based in zigzag indi, and we all know what it means.

--- 帖子 #2286 ---
I just don't know what to say, for me it works very well, sounds and e-mail included.

Maybe somebody else could help you and fix the problem.

--- 帖子 #2287 ---
That's why yesterday was an awful day for me and I'm always late on everything!!!  (I don't like to be late at all. I hate it.)

I've been thinking about what you told us, and you're right, it's easier and faster if you put your TP at the green line, but I prefer to stay more time in the ride and get more pips (I am a peaceful and patient person, I know) using the nature of the indi itself. The red, blue and green lines you see were rescued by those scammers I talk about before, they renamed all the indicators, but particularly this one (the channel with red and blue lines and green line in the middle) is a TMA (triangular moving average) channel, made by this special MA (a very very smooth one) and it's desviations to make the channel. In the nature of TMA, as I see it, there is the "intention" to not only come back to the green line, but in addition come back to the other side of the channel. (I don't know if I have express it in the correct way, sometimes English is difficult for me).

Having everything you say and what I've just write in mind, maybe the TP line depends on the psycology of the trader... you can take the dotted lines, the green line or the other-side-in-the-channel line. What do you think about it?

--- 帖子 #2288 ---
I see this thread develops pretty well (not) after Nasap was banned because of a commercial report (thanks again lo..)

I still dont see you posting regularly interesting stuff ? Why ?

--- 帖子 #2289 ---
(no problem for english, between strangers we use simple words and we can understand each other often easier than with native speakers )

yes i understand your point of view ( i like bollinger  )  but unfortunately it can't be enough simple i think

because when you will be in a nice trend you will lose several consecutives trades,

furthermore you know that boxes deliver a lot of signals especially when the market becomes choppy so you must be careful

yes psychology but more important , in which perspective are you ?

scalp,swing, with/against the trend,reintegration,range, etc etc

so if you want to let run the movement you need to be sure the previous movement is terminated and so need others indi or analysis of other TF,

try to catch big swings against a trend which is not yet dead is a non sens in my opinion

--- 帖子 #2290 ---
It is impossible to fix this because the box indi (13osma, 13complex, 13cci, 13FiM, etc.) repaint themselves for 1 box

However, currently I test your template with  Doda-Donchianv3 indi (I think that works great with renko chart)

set chanell peroid = 34

I use Adjustable Shift Indicator Renko Chart Builder from Kiads http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=454060

set box size 8-12 pips with 25-50% shift

some entry examples:

Hi,

Casyopea

The bands work perfect and there is one indicator to which I have added, Snake Borders. With this, it makes complete sense on what, why, where....

Trust me, its acting something like buy in low and sell in high. This indicator seems to be similar to Mustaga Belkhayate, but the one you have posted seems to be very power full indeed

Here is a screenshot of trades, I have taken, please see screenshot. There is one guy called Cognizant. He uses the same indicator(Bands) and I was begging him, he would never. ever never answer for my question.

Its really great of you, that you have given this indicator for free.

May the Almighty always be with you.

Thanks once again from my bottom of my heart

Please add this...........EVERYBODY!!!!

--- 帖子 #2299 ---
Casyopea,

I got one more idea today !!!!

Have semafor on 15 min chart ok?

Then have it on the renko chart as well.

If and only if you have the last semafor on both, ONLY THEN OPEN POSITION !!!!

May be that will be the best, if not either renko or 15 min chart will make low, low low and low....

TESTING

Casyopea,

YES,YES,YES All histograms are repainters, except one....... KArl Dittman's extra signal Sir.

Have you come across?

But that will not give the signal right at the bottom or right at the top.......

MMMmmmmm

Only one way out, as said we have to wait for last semafor on both 15 m and renko..........and thats it.......go for the execution.....

--- 帖子 #2308 ---
Look at the settings in the indicator and read them carefully. Then look at the 13 boxes at their repainting issue. The arrows don't repaint but, we all know that they're based in one indi that definitely does, so that's the reason to use another indicator: ichimoku, coral, a channel or something that could tell us the main trend and the possible resistance and support zones.

Some people ask Kickme how he colors the candles. Perhaps this indicator is similar. Put all in indicators folder and put Genesis_ESET_candles_2.00 on the chart.

Maybe people can find good settings and post them.

When you first put it on the chart some candles are yellow, i changed them to blue.

"Desfavorable indis" are the number of 13-blocks indicators you don't mind to be on other color. Change settings to: Favorable indicators=4, desfavorable indis=0. (the arrow only will appear if all 4 indicators have the same color). If you put 100 or 200 in the "count bars" setting...it won't crash your pc. Give it a try and tell me about the results, please!

Have you enabled "early signal" in the 13-blocks settings?

Hi michaelB

The settings i used in that image i just found when i was playing around with settings, so wasn't really doing any serious research so i didn't keep a record of what they were, sorry about that.

I sometimes find disregarding logic and assumptions about what settings look like they should be (within reason) and just using fairly random settings can find some good combinations, and then refine them.

In this eurusd chart i used a 10 pip renko and the Genesis as, as they are listed are 300, 200, 100, 200, 200, 0.618, 200. Color #6 is red, #7 is blue.

I didn't refine them yet. I think this chart is good for a tp of about 300 pips. Obviously some losses in there but with a bit of money management it'll probably be ok.

Hi Casyopea, I'm pleased you like it, it's just good that there are people around who can code these things.

Good luck with testing it with your template, let use know how it goes.

--- 帖子 #2327 ---
Hi pipstogo,

Can you send your template, please?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #2328 ---
Hi cenky, I was only referring to Casyopea's template in the quote, i don't have one. However, if you didn't already check out post 2,366 above for the indicator.

--- 帖子 #2329 ---
Just to save possible confusion for anyone trying the Genesis candles indi, be sure you have all the necessary indies in the indi folder otherwise your terminal is likely to hang. If that happens just restart the terminal and make sure to have the required indies in the folder.

--- 帖子 #2330 ---
ah ok, it's for when there is red and blue at the same time ? but i thought that was really rare, i don't remember have seen that in live, just when i look back on the chart

i put 3 for " fav indi" to don't miss start of movement but it's not really useful i think so i'll put 4

thanks for your fast answers casyopea

--- 帖子 #2331 ---

i'm trying to create new terminals because my computer don't support too many charts of renko,

i've copied " indicators " templates " and "profils " in the folders of new terminals but when i load my template the nasap 13 indicators don't appear on the chart

i've copied them in basic folder  Attached Image

and

in the virtual ( don't really know what i'm doing so i copy everywhere ... ^^ )   Attached Image

usually it works but here nasap don't appears but it appears well in list of indicators on the plateform

(when i put them myself after have load the template or before, i've just blue and grey boxes...)

any idea ?

--- 帖子 #2334 ---
Can you tell me why you changed the yellow to blue and not red. It seems that if we do that then we are making it all bullish candles and in the one screen shot are always against the trend. In the other I changed the yellow to red and it provided better results. So now the question which way to color the yellow. Are these part of the genesis system? Then I wont move forward because those indicators repainted.

Just a thought had anyone tried asking Calstar ( kickme's provider) if he could post the candles.

--- 帖子 #2335 ---
@thomasz1:     I have the same problem with some (rarely used) indis. I read somewhere(don´t remember where) not to install mt4 under program files(x86).

I think it said install under C:

but I havn´t tried yet. If you try it and it works, please tell me...

--- 帖子 #2336 ---
I'm sorry my friend. I wish I would tell you this before but...the channel repaints (I love this indi, even if it repaints...you know, CARPE DIEM ). So be careful and if you want to manual test your template do it in live. I have been testing the donchian in my template, and it is always more or less in the center of the channel, so it's useless for me now.

Please, tell us how it's going your testing!!! We can improve our templates and systems helping each others!!!

--- 帖子 #2337 ---
I was just thinking the same:"why blue and not red?"

I tried some time ago asking Kickme and locating Calstar... nothing at all.

Soooooooooo... come on guys!!!!  Put your imagination to work!!!! If somebody doesn't want to help you, just do it by yourself!!!

Waiting for your ideas...

Casyo.

--- 帖子 #2338 ---
Hi sanfranfan, There was no particular reason for changing them to blue instead of red. I posted the chart simply for people to get a feel of how the chart looks and make comparisons to kickme's chart posts. I am not recommending any particular set up here.

I agree, making color # 6 red and #7 blue is most likely a better idea.

With regard to repainting, all i can say is i ran the indicator on my renko back test script and i didn't see it repaint. Once the candle closes it appears to stay the same color. Of course there maybe instances where it doesn't but i didn't see any.

I think some one who understands the coding could give a definitive answer.

Here is back test chart with the indi, ignore the trades, that's just my ea doing its thing and it's not set up for the chart.

If you like coloured candles I respect it, but, from my point of view maybe this one is more logical indi:

hey thanks ! i've made copy in a folder of desktop, now indis work and when i load template with mihailo alert that doesn't crash mt4 ! ( i've tried to do it on older copies of terminals but alert indi crashed the terminal every time )

but now ?

--- 帖子 #2342 ---
I agree with putting imagination to work.  My imagination tells me that the candles are part of the original Gen 1 system that was revised all the way up to the version I have which is 2.21 and is now commercial. Isn't that what happens to every indicator developed in these threads? We all collectively help test, give feed back, contribute when we can and finally get an email 2 weeks after the OP drops off the face of the earth offering us a "better version".
The yellow candles represent a flat market and mean that you should exit a trade or not trade at all. Blue and red are self explanatory. Shading the yellow to either blue or red will only skew results one way or the other. The indicator is based off 4 oscillators and the candles are an extension of all the blocks lining up in a row. Changing the setting as in the previous posts will show some great back test results (that's why I bought it) but when you apply to a fast moving market it can't keep up, will freeze your unit and worse change mid stream.

I purchased the complete updated system and it SUCKS!!!!!!. The result is I am now back here looking for a better way to trade. They do repaint in a fast moving market which seems to be the problem with most indicators when applied to a Renko chart. For those that still want to give it a try and donate to their money to the market feel free here is the base indicator.

Just an FYI Casyopia as a new member you are usually blocked form sending PM's you may want to try again they have both been responsive to me. Calstar not as quick but Kick me is still kicking and has been sending a few of us some pips .

--- 帖子 #2343 ---
if you want to remove them because it crashes mt4 ( what i've to do too ) just go on " C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Local\Virtu alStore\Program Files (x86) ""
and go delete the indi in the folder " experts=> indicators "  after that you'll can restart the plateform

--- 帖子 #2344 ---
What arrows are you talking about

--- 帖子 #2345 ---
guy... we are talking about that since 1 week... furthermore the answer is in the post i've quoted " offs mihailo alert indi "

--- 帖子 #2346 ---
Hi, I do not want to remove the arrows, just have them placed closer to the price.

On time based charts, often they print many pips away from the candlesticks, just need them to print closer to the bars.

(This is for the offs mihailo indi which prints an arrow when the specified number of blocks are same colour.)

Thanks in anticipation.

--- 帖子 #2347 ---
Yes I have but is unles ,like semafor indi repait like the hell it is like pattrn indi unles

--- 帖子 #2348 ---
Yes, the blocks repaints two or three boxes in the past, that's why the arrows works so well, because they only appear when the boxes are all the same color and you don't see all that "repaint noise". A little treak, when the arrow appears and send you the alarm, just wait till the close of the candle, the arrow can repaint like the boxes, but once the candle is closed, it doesn't repaint at all.

--- 帖子 #2349 ---
I was checking the system and found it too much interesting but at the same time, its a complex system, what i think is that this system is best for those who loves complex trading, Mihailo is a very good trader, i would like to have him here again, i don't know where he is in these days, he disappeared like previously but with his system, traders are making money.

I am still in practice with mihailo trading system, few questions!

- I noticed that block indicators repaints too often, and i realized that it is because of early signal feature but, i want to know, do you guys are trading with EarlyFilter = true?

--- 帖子 #2350 ---
i didn't compare with early signals and without early signals unfortunately (if you do it, let us know )

but you can wait that candle closes to be more confident with the entry,

the arrows don't repaint after the close of the candle,

and/or you can couple this indi with other indis and you will see the repaint of 2-3 candles' boxes is really not a problem

question : how can we backtest renko ?

i've found that  Attached File(s)   Off-line charts FAQ.pdf

there is an explanation but it talks about CRB script at the end so i can't do it,

i've read that too but that doesn't work ( (just succeed to crash my MT4 several times...)

so if you have the solution , i take ! :

go to strategie tester and choose RenkoLiveChart

as ExpertAdvisor. choose M1 for backtest TF. in

the EA setting switch EnableOnlineChart to false.

start visual backtester in Pause-Mode and the usual

M1 TF Chart starts. Now go to OfflineChart in the

Filemenu and choose the Timerframe which are

converted into Renkos and open them. Press Pause

again and you will see that the Renkos will start

ticking like in reallive-mode.

the only thing you have to avoid is the backtest

speed...

Keep in mind that every indicator uses processor. the more bars and indicators you have the more the load on the processor

Hello Mark

Please fine below my set based on Casio, all indi and EA attached, hope I don't forget about some indi

Basicly it is Casio timplate but with trailing stop, from time to time I use "proporcional trailing stop" (trade_protector-1.0.ex4) and line trader.

My idea of EA... it would work like line trader with with rueles on screen below... (with adjustable break events, trailing stop or proporcional ts)

(eg. first BE would set stop loss on the blue line level)

entry rules BUY... eg. HA crose the blue line (with up trend... or if last 3 candels was red)

it is hard to add possibility of open long/short order automaticly by EA?

Dear @apacaston: I personally use 5 pips block size, some people prefer 10 or even 20 pips block size because it has much less "noise".

Hello Mihailo, and user,

I'm a newbie on trading, i mean it's 3 years that i try to take good profit with this and with mt4 i still have some problem, but with time, and study i'm sure to improve my knowledge.

One friend tell me about this system and he said is very good and profittable if people can understand well how to use, i'm here i would to use my micro account for test it, i've downloading all data from first post and using profile and templates for micro account, like Mihailo have write here.

Problem when i've loading from Profile 5!v1 or 5set, i see some chart with " Waiting for update " on top corner of window's mt4 going offline, i've read the first post and manual but i could not find any solution for this problem, what i can do ?

Thank's attention, hope i can become a good trader (i not ask much some pip at day that's enough) with you!

Take care, and have nice day.

EDIT 16/01/13 14:51 -  my broker is Iamfx is ok, or i have to look for other one ?

EDIT 16/01/13 15:00 -  i see the indicator now, i've reinstalled all rar file and i not use the micro file that i found here, i think one or much file missing on that file, for now i can check the market with standard versione, but what change from micro account?

I am a little bit lost in this thread. The system discussed now has only little to do with the original layed out systems of Mihailo.

Yesterday I installed Casyopeas package (post #2315). I replaced RenkoLiveChart version with RenkoLiveChart_v3.4.ex4.

It became some kind of fiasko.

All NASAP-indicators uninitialized and removed themselves from the chart. The same did all FL-indicators.

RenkoLiveChart is running but I do not get a Renko chart. The Chart is shown in the timeframe I choose, 1min, 5min, 15 min ...

If I drop Heiken Ashi I have no bars or bricks at all.

A restart of MT4 does not help.

Are there any additional indicators, templates or EA from post #1 to copy to the folders in MT4?

--- 帖子 #2395 ---
hi honey

i didn't find tma slope(blue-green and red bands) in that post.

does it work in renko shifted chart?

--- 帖子 #2396 ---
does it repaint?

thanks for your reply.

--- 帖子 #2397 ---
One of them repaints, but the "TRUE" one doesn't repaint. Don't be afraid of repaint issue, put them on your chart and see the results. Sometimes "repaint" is not so bad.

In the indicators attached in the compressed file, TMA is called FL02 or something like that, if you install the template you'll be able to see all the settings.

--- 帖子 #2398 ---
Dear, have you installed the template properly in an offline chart with non-standard timeframe?

You have to install the expert (RenkoLiveChart) on M1 and in the settings use a timeframe like M3, M4, M6,...

Then open the offline chart with the timeframe you've used and apply the template to that offline chart.

There isn't additional indicators from post #1 to add to the folders on MT4, I think.

And I know that this system nowadays has only a little to do with the original that Mihailo showed us, but is my personal evolution. As I see it, every trader must "change" an original system and "play" enough to feel comfortable with it, adding indicators, or changing the settings. I'd like everyone to share their opinions, their systems and maybe different indis or settings.

I suggest you to look at NASAP's version, in this thread. Maybe it feels more comfortable to you.

Regards.

Casyo.

--- 帖子 #2399 ---
yes,normal to be a little bit lost since everybody adapt the renko charts but imo, a thing you mustn't forget is that even in the mihailo's system, he was regarding higher "TF" if i can say( with his little chart in the left bottom corner and was looking some other TF according to THV system(without forget coral) )  to be in the right direction,

i didn't test casyopea strategy but looks to have great results so you can try that and if it's not good for you , look to trade with the trend,it can't be bad ! that's sure

Any ideas???

--- 帖子 #2403 ---
Are the offline charts correct?

If yes, Go to the list of currencies on the left hand side of your MT4

click on the same currency as on your chart and drag and drop it on to your screen

If the offline charts are not there, you'll have to install them again

--- 帖子 #2404 ---
Thank you for the responses. I have been using the Renko EA chart builder before. I spent all day yesterday on the phone with my broker. The problem is not the indicator it is the MT platform. In case anyone is not aware the new build 574 is due to come out soon. My broker used a beta version and updated me automatically. There is a bug in the new version and it is a major one.

Something about the .hst file. I have the new version now (574) and while the offline charts still work indicators that are not standard issue to the platform itself do not. To get them to work they need to be recompiled and if the code is not original to the build or has simply been copied it will error out and freeze the platform.

I contacted MT directly yesterday and was informed that the changes are to cut down on pirated copies of software that have  been decompiled illegally and close backend issues. They directed me to a number of "preferred" coders who could recode my indicators or develop new ones to replace the ones that will not work, for a fee of course.

I submitted the semafor and the new TMA and both were rejected as pirated and not of "original format".

I tried to go back to a 509 and was able to thru FXCM but am told that the update will be forced anyway.

So for now I can trade using the indicators but have much doubt that these will work in the future.

To me sounds like MT wants a piece of the third party coding business and has gone the way of trade station.

If anyone else has info we have a few days before this 574 goes standard hopefully we can find a way to protect what we have. I know my junk mail has been hit heavy with offers of Renko indicators for the new build and really hope I don't have to invest in those. The pallada wont even work and I bought that one.

--- 帖子 #2405 ---
Check your build sounds like exactly what happened to me. Go to about  Help>About> look for build number if it's 574 welcome to the club.

Hi My Friend,   maybe you don't check platform tech sub forum about this topic,  this already explained there ;
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=468157

and about renko chart builder, maybe you can try my renko chart builder indicator version , which already adjusted to MT4 build 574 with big help from Mladen TSD , you can try to compile it with the new meta editor,  you can download it here : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...20#post7237820

But remember that this new release of MT4 is still unstable so use it carefully.

Hope it help and happy trading.

PS.  to create standard renko chart, just set percentage shift to 100 %

to create mean/median renko chart just set percentage shift to 50 %

and of course for my georenko chart set the percentage shift to 12.5 %

--- 帖子 #2407 ---
Thank you for the indicator. My problem is not the Renko I have that. Even with yours my indicators will not show up on the offline chart I get "illegal use" on the bottom of the charts.

Question what do you mean "unstable" do you mean the indicator itself or the platform.

Thanks!!!

--- 帖子 #2408 ---
The New MT4 platform.. lol,  definitely not stable at this moment,   they still keep updating with new builds  start from 574 until now 579 in only several days, that mean the platform not yet stable..and keep changing..

about 'illegal use' warning of your indicator(s),  do you open the mq4 file codes ?  if you see that it was decompiled version of mq4 file,(usually purebeam job.. lol) then yes, since build 509 , you can't use that kind of piracy files

To solve the problem just wait until the new MT4 platform become more stable, in I believe there's a lot of our friend here will help to re-writen or adjust the old indicators mq4 files  for compatibility with  this new platform

Hope it help and best regard.

Ok good news is all my indicators still work with the new build. I had to recompile then ad to indicators file and then reinstall the platform.  Only indicator I cant get to work is the Live chart 3.3 renko EA. It is in my experts navigator but nothing happens when I attach to the chart. Any ideas? Kiads where would I install yours.

Thanks to all

Hi My Friend,

You can go to my thread at Post 1  attachment, there are new update for Renko Meand/Median chart builder indicator and Range Bar chart builder  mark with MT45   this is for MT4 build 600, (re-written by Mladen TSD), and both are Indicators,  so you should put it in MQL4/Indicators  in your MT4 terminal folder (if you use /portable  option from your MT4 icon),  or you can go to Menu File / OpenData Folder and put at MQL4/Indicators  there. After that you can re-compile it with Meta Editor.

Hope it help and best regard.

Hi,

Guys,

I don't know where Nasap has gone. No replies or posts or nothing from him.

Can any one of you in the thread please post the uploaded indikators set

CCI,OSMA,MACD... Pallada please...

After the build / new mt4 version...its not working properly.

It will not only help me but any one of them in this thread.

Here they are.

Though they 'Repaint' Heavily which I think has Destroyed their Potentialities.

she was moved to the commercial section, thats why she is gone... and don´t worry about her indicators, if you pick your entries and exits on saturday you can do 100% winners too ;-)

--- 帖子 #2419 ---
Hi,

Marley,

You are the second person whom I am coming across who is sharing without any hestitation. One of them was Pardy Singh from India. I really do not know where he is now, he does not seem to respond.

I do agree that Pallada does REPAINT. Nasap has converted this into a Holy Grail system. Even we have to do it. "When one can do it, why not we?"

Well, If you are still reading this thread, please see this video.

The link is given below. It makes so much of sense....And also, please send a msg for Nasap as well to see this video...in case u have the email adress of her.

http://niftymillionaire.com/beta/

Yes, I forgot to tell, please see the screenshot, it is not giving any of the red boxes at all....only blue ones are seen in the indicators? Any idea how to correct them?

Please advice.

Hi All Renko Lover,

If you want to continue use your renko chart builder program (EA, Indicators, or Scripts), in this new MT4 environment, please just update to MT4 build 604. this is the version that still can work with offline chart builder program. Never update to MT4 build 610 (the latest update), if you doing that, you can't use 'any' offline chart builder program at all. Its look like MQ try to eliminate offline chart capabilities with the latest update (b610), just like MT5. We (coder) try to solve this problem before with previous update, and manage to make it work, but MQ keep changing MT4 platform with continue renew it almost every several days, and finally in MT4 build 610, they totally block any attempt to create offline chart, with free offline chart builder. maybe they want to release their own 'builder' (not free of course) via market.. lol.

So, it is better if you create back up of your MT4 build 509 (the old one), and also MT4 build 604 (known new version still allow offline renko chart creation). Make it rar file the whole folder, and keep it in safe place.

As always happy trading and never give up.

MTH

--- 帖子 #2426 ---
Dear Kiads

Why do you say that no offline chart can be used with MT4 build 610?

See a screenshot I just made using your !MTH Renko Chart Builder Indi ver 02.

All my Renko charts work perfectly.

--- 帖子 #2427 ---
Yes My Friend, I know that, I create that baby..lol.

but there is 'something' in MT4 build 610, that if they need it, they can just block the program anytime they want via Windows API. so you are not 100% control your program.

We hope we can solve this problem just like any problems before.. with this new MT4 never ending update..lol

I tried to install this system but the files no longer work correctly.  Since the source files were never shared and the original owner has not been back, this system can no longer function.

--- 帖子 #2441 ---
Hey guys ,i think this thread is very interesting cause it is the main idea of my system,time doesn't matter PA only so you cant use Candlesticks alone or renko alone you have to use them both to avoid choppy and low volatile market so i started a thread recently that discusses my system that i have been using for more than 4 years.it is called extreme analysis system.

Hi,

I have the 783 version of metatrader, but shows the same user problems Rolas, which are:

2) most of the time hanging metatrader and again must be reinstalled.

hi, anyone can help???

--- 帖子 #2449 ---
i have the same renko issue. nothing happening on my renko charts.  help appreciated.

--- 帖子 #2450 ---
First, get the Renko Bricks to work. No additional profiles, templates or whatever. Enable EAs in Metatrader, open a new M1 chart and attach the Renko Building EA to it. Then open the offline chart and watch the moving bricks.

If you are not sure which Renko Builder to use, you can use the one I made. You can find it in my attached files. I am typing from an iPad currently, so please excuse that I dont provide a link to it.

When this is working, I can guide you through the setup process for the system.

Best, V.

--- 帖子 #2451 ---
Here is the Renko Builder. It's an EA, so please copy it into the Experts Folder. Again, you don't need to use this EA, you can use any Renko Builder you like. The one attached just works.

Best, V.

--- 帖子 #2452 ---
Hi,

I can see that 10 people already downloaded the Renko Builder, so I suggest that people are interested to set up this system. I believe it's a good one. Please make sure you get the Renkos to work on your PC ( I know, the markets are closed currently, so it's not that easy to set up ). We need 50 points Renko Bricks on offline TimeFrame M3.

Coming Monday I'll go ahead and set up the system with you. Some components of the original system are outdated, some simply not needed. I will set up a system that works and will post all needed information and components here.

Best, V.

Thank you for the link. I did see your thread already and initially gave up after the first few pages because it looked very complex to me. Now, I'll make a new try and read the thread completely. I will delay here with the setup because of this, but

a) I cannot do everything in parallel and I think your system is a very good one as well

b) I need screen time with a system I got from a friend which works

The interesting thing is that out of the hundrets of systems the very promising ones seem to use similar methods. I don't want to be redundant and try the proven systems first before I create another variant which may be covered by existing ones already.

I have a question about Renko trading with this system. The box size is set at 5 and as shown in the attached pic, I have what I am calling spinning tops since that is what they look like. From what I have learned so far, a new brick wont get displayed until the price has moved at least 5 pips with the box size set at 5. Why are there these "spinning top" like bricks then, as indicated by the arrows. What do they mean, if anything. Thanks

Mihailo,

I am aware that you posted this several years ago, and that I have discovered your post so late (sorry!), but your system looks very interesting and I would like to try it. However, I get "Waiting for the Update" message on my MT4 terminal and it stays there apparently forever. You do say here that we need to wait a "few days" to collect history data. Does it mean that we need to keep the computer turned on, and MT4 running open for several days? Am I the only one experiencing this? Since nobody seems to mention this problem. How many days do we need to wait? Would it work if I have computer turned on for a few hours every day? Would it still keep accumulating history data? Or does it have to be continuously done? I do have a fast computer and fast Internet connection.

Zemljace, pomozi!

Hi ! Maybe you can share main idea here... it's a very interesting thread on Renko...

Main idea is good as simple.

Chart: Renko
Indicators: Kumo Cloud (from Ichimoku Kinko Hyo).
hamaft3anewualert (this indicator is an HAMA but it has some different values that make it works perfectly with my strategy).

Buy trigger conditions:
The price have to close a renko candle above and completely outside the kumo cloud. The Kumo cloud must be green color.
The Hama must be green color as well.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Close The Position when The HAMA indicator change color in red.

Profit:

Loss:

Sell trigger conditions:

The price have to close a renko candle below and completely outside the kumo cloud. The Kumo cloud must be red color.
The Hama must be red color as well.

Close The Position when The HAMA indicator change color in green.

NOTE: (The kumo cloud color is the one who is forming in the current time and not the one who is below or above the price)

The only problem with this strategy is that is very boring trading with Renko, because you have to constantly watch the screen. That is why I'm looking for some good programmer who can automte the all thing.

Does anyone know a free scanner for scanning all market & time frames to get the best trends?

--- 帖子 #2549 ---
Hey,

Its not an EA.

but i am using renko and gann as like  nat has said.

Without gann you cannot succeed and I have realized it today.....only after blowing up hundreds of accounts and real money.

See todays trade.

No Gann Angles, no success....

--- 帖子 #2550 ---

Well, one can get to that core of success if and only if we pay attention to her threads.

Waiting to hit 100,000 Dollar mark !!!

--- 帖子 #2564 ---
Ravi my friend, I appreciate but I believe 100% your strategy will destroy you

Because of no stop losses your max drawdown is 100% so you risk losing everything

I checked your account yesterday, you were in red -$20,000
http://ibb.co/FxWHJbF

There is no way you would have the guts to keep this open on live, trust me!

Nevertheless, I wish you good luck and I hope this will actually go your way

--- 帖子 #2565 ---
u are a 100% correct...i cannot win a contest, but can win in live trading account.

I am seeing that drawdown is destroying the value... of a trading account.

I will correct myself...

--- 帖子 #2566 ---
can u now capture the screenshot

It's not a real big deal to set up a Renko chart and/or to modify it a bit to its own style.

Sorry, but the system is absolutely useless as it freezes the Metatrader all the time.

No use for this.

After following the instructions the Metatrader still freezes.

You wasted my time

--- 帖子 #2578 ---
I don't trade this system, but it's a solvable problem.

--- 帖子 #2579 ---
I hope you are not serious when you say "you wasted my time" ?

Trading require a lot of personal work, and nobody here are paid for do that for you.

--- 帖子 #2580 ---

--- 帖子 #2587 ---
Short silver now

IST: 17:34

--- 帖子 #2588 ---
After a very long time, I am back, blowing off at least 200 demo accounts, and also big time real money.

I came across, a very instersting strategy to trade successfully using renko charts. I am confident, you can even beat Nasap.... no offense...just kidding

Just apply this attached template to your eur/usd charts and place trades on renko accordingly. Any doubt, feel free to ping me.

cheers!!!

--- 帖子 #2589 ---
Why a template and no indicators. Are you selling something?

--- 帖子 #2590 ---
One does wonder Phil

--- 帖子 #2591 ---
hey,

dont get me wrong.

To be explained in plain simple language.

you will generally find VOLUME on the x axis and not on the y axis. i have put the same on the y axis. high volume.

nothing else and it is no secret. its a 4 hr chart's volume bars. no indicators or nothing.

--- 帖子 #2592 ---
Anyone can take this trade

ist 13:01

i post the result in a few minutes.

We have to short and not buy

short @ 24.616

--- 帖子 #2593 ---
Trade is active now

--- 帖子 #2594 ---
Please use this template. its a 4 hour high volume bars.

--- 帖子 #2595 ---
Sorry, sorry....

see how this goes. pls eliminate the previous one USe this instead.

anyone using should pls reply to me, if not...me posting this is of no use.

--- 帖子 #2596 ---
Can someone help me convert the Renko strategy into a trading robot?

--- 帖子 #2597 ---
first you need to post indicators and template...

--- 帖子 #2598 ---
Hi Jibala,

Hope you well!

Saw yer post ere while looking around, would you be so kind to send me this template with indicators if you please!? I am just starting to use renko and good to see you post a lovely chart!

Your contribution to the ff has been very valuable!

Wising you all the best!

TIA

--- 帖子 #2599 ---
Hey Traders

Really want to be profitable using Renko charts?
