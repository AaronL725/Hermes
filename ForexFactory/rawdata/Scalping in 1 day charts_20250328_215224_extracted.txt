Hi! First to all, sorry for my horrible english. i have been working with this method for 2 years and with this indi. for some months ago. You only need 1 day chart, Nihilist_ultra_trend indi and paint some trendlines to touch the glory. this Nihilist indi is the heart of the method. Thank you very much for this repainting indicator. How to work. At 00:00 hours u need to be in front of ur computer. The rest of the day you can be living and enjoying the day. you only need a few minutes to won thousands of bucks, remember. this method is basically to people that dont have much time to trade during the day. when price breaks the little trendline and ultra trend indi is in the same direction,enter. if you had closed a trade because price breaks the trendline, wait to ultra trend turn the color. is very easy, stress-free and very profitable. ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: When you are into a trade and you are floating around +70 or +100 pips, is a good moment to define your BE (spread +1 point). Not is a defined TP or SL. Template: Attached File(s) @@@glory_in_1_day_chart@@@.tpl 28 KB | 5,319 downloads Here you have too (finally) the Nihilist ultra_trend indi. Attached File(s) Nihilist_Ultra_Trend_V2.ex4 10 KB | 6,107 downloads

here you have an example. this chart is since march as you can see. here are my trades in eurusd pair. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #3 ---
you can play with all pairs and see. i only work with 4 pairs because for me, its enough.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Which 00H?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
if you want, i can upload the template, but not the indicator because if you look on the web you find it easy cheers

--- 帖子 #6 ---
when the new 1 day candle start. 00:01 hours if u want. Ultra trend indicator doesnt repaint.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
MM For me, 100 pips= 5% of my account.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
very interesting concept.... - what does the indicatot need to do? you enter trade from second indicator candle as i understand since the first one has to finish? - what is 1day chart? like first candle in H1 chart?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
As far as i know does Nihilist ultra trend repaint. The indicator that dont repaint from Nihilist is the adx, dhruba, holygrail, trendcycle and magic.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
....But not said this aint interesting. If you want i indicator like the Ultra-trend that doesnt repaint, use Swingmans' scalper, it works great for 'scalping the daily chart' http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=166646

--- 帖子 #11 ---
tnavi, this look nice and promising hope to see more charts and how you trade it . please if you can show more example how you enter and exit trade . I will following your thread.thanks

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Also do you close your trade every @00.00 before you open another or when you met your target of 100 pip that is it for the day or how do you trade this indicator. thanks

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Yes you are right,Nihilist ultra trend repaints, the value of this idea is in the break of the trend line, but there are traders who always need some indi for a visual confirmation, then this indi can give you that, knowing that It repaints sometimes.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
hi merry, i have been using too this indi in 5 min chart with another method and works very fine for me. when a new bar appeared, is very, very rare that change again of color. and how all people knows, in 5 min charts are a lot of sound.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
thanks again for ur offer but Ultra trend works fine for me now. someday i prove it.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
this is that i wanted to say. thanks!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
here u have another great example for how to work with 1 day charts. the important is caught all small moves in the chart. this is audusd chart since march. Attached Image (click to enlarge) when price breaks the trendline, i see if UT indi is in the same color and then, i take the wave. now price is in range but im long since 10.20.2014. this green bar doesnt move.

Hello Tnavi,Thanks for this wonderful thread.Will be helpful if u upload "Template &amp; Indicator too" for the newbie like me.~Thanks &amp; regards.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Great but It is not precisely scalping, I mean you let your positions for some days right? Simplicity is always the best, no need to complicate things. Eres español?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
i have uploaded the template in first post

--- 帖子 #22 ---
for this reason i calle the method scalping within "" its a mode to call this method. and yes, an operation can even take weeks. im from Basque Country

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Congrats, but be ready for some frecuent posters who jump from thread to thread always making problems and wanting you to add like a dozen more indicators to confirm what your eyes see. Good aprouch you have here as I said I like simple methods, no need to complicate charts with many indicators like a Cristmas tree.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
bad people are in all sites. had the need to pay the community with a method that works for me since very many months ago. cheers

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi tnavi, I like what you are doing here. My way of trading EOD charts it can take a long time for a new trend to develop. This way gets you into a new mini or longer term trend much quicker. When I get back from my trip I'll take a closer look at it.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
thanks for ur words steve. this is the "scalping" 1 day method powa

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi, do you use any stop loss? and do you have any fixed Take profit? thanks for sharing, Agurrak from Catalonia P.S. do you know a Basque trader called Aitor Zárate?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I meant which time zone? Dukascopy and LMAX have default charts set to GMT, FxPro to GMT+2, Oanda to Pacific time... Each broker will show 00:00 on their charts, but the open, close, high, low won't be the same for everyone.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
hi joan. i dont have a defined Sl or TP. sometimes i can loss 100 pips or 200. And win 200 pips or 500. Mercy from Donosti xDD I have see that Zarate is a fish seller. i dont know if he can win the market. i know that he live in Lanzarote or Tenerife (im not sure) and sell a lot of seminary to life

--- 帖子 #30 ---
i have Madrid timezone +1 with my demo broker time. i use it data because works very fine for me.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
U Got nothing to prove, just because the indicator repaints, doesnt mean its i bad system. I like it alot, ive done some visuel backtesting yesterday, and with pretty great result. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hello tnavi I do I get this nihilist indicator I cannot find it in my MT4 Thanks

--- 帖子 #33 ---

--- 帖子 #34 ---

Sorry as being newbie.~Thanks &amp; regards.

--- 帖子 #35 ---

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Result since 1 January: Eurusd +2220 pips exactly. Gbpusd +2625 pips exactly. Thanks god.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
That is pretty good. Are these numbers from real account or back test? Also, can you tell me what the draw down was? Thanks

--- 帖子 #42 ---
around 1000 pips was in demos and the rest in real. firstly withou ultra trend indi and the with it.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
the DD is very little. now i cant tell u.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Looks promising , will follow closely ,i like it very simple,subscribe

--- 帖子 #45 ---
look nice may i know can you upload mq4 file? i unable to use ex4 file in my trading software.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Very interesting strategy mate! I'll backtest it during this week-end May i ask if you use any rules for exit or simply how you choose to do it? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
what lots have you traded for each position

--- 帖子 #48 ---
again, look into the Nihilist thread please because this indi is of this member. is a artist and a great trader.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
i only paint trendlines. when price breaks the trendline, normally i exit and wait for another great entry.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
normally 100 pips is the 5% of my account. trust me, is a very agressive method but effective. when i get the 100% of the account y re-estimate again the lots.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hello tnavi... Your system sounds interesting. One thing is not clear to me is in the example graph, I see the present day's bar didn't start from the closing price of yesterday's bar. Plz help me as I'm still a learner. Thanx

--- 帖子 #52 ---
added a new long in gbpusd 1 day chart. the price is in long mode since 10.16 and i think that this last days the price makes a little retracement. Attached Image (click to enlarge) friday afternoon is a good moment to take a place in market.....sometimes. good weekend!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi tnavi, I like the idea you have here. I have not had good experience with Heiken Ashi bars in the past. Do these bars fool you in thinking price is past the trendline when it actually isn't? Thanks

--- 帖子 #54 ---
so in 1 week if all your 4 pairs hit the TP which is 100 pips your geting 16dollars ? .04cents x 100pips TP for each pair = $4 $4 x 4 pairs iis = $16dollars right pls correct me im wrong PS i write .04cents because i saw your open trade .04 on your chart

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Dear friend "Tnavi" Would you like to share another method too?~Thanks &amp; regards

--- 帖子 #56 ---
tnavi The system has merit in its simplicity. Just one question: is well known that draw TL is a bit subjective, some tip on how you do it?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
To feel safe with these bars I'll just add a 1 SMA to help me know where the actual close is. Thanks for the thread and your time

--- 帖子 #58 ---
0.04 contract means 1pip=0.4cents Thus 100*0.4= 40$

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Thanks "tnavi" Hope you share your other method too on 5 minutes time frame. ~Thanks &amp; regards.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
for this is important to left close the bar. when one day ends and a trendline is breaken is the moment to enter.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
this charts are from a demo account. u cant know how much i have

--- 帖子 #62 ---
u have thousands of methods into internet. i give u an idea....how much do u need?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
i know my friend

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thank you tnavi

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hear Hear I Second that Sir! Thanks n God Bless You!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hola el meu amic, I like your concept and method, it is very smart indeed! I would suggest just one thing and that would be to check an Oscillator like Stochastics before entering your trades by looking for OB/OS levels. Any Oscillator can be used whether it is the Stochastics, RSI, CCI, Williams %R, etc. The safest trades are found when price reaches the extremes and OB/OS levels are considered to be extreme points where good entries can be found especially on the higher time frames like the 4H, Daily, Weekly and Monthly charts. Try the Fast Stochastics with these settings = 5,3,3 I hope that thought helps you and gives you even better entries! I don't speak great Catalan/Spanish, I'm still learning. But... Gaudir d'un cap setmana

--- 帖子 #67 ---
thavi do you draw trend lines by hand? Can i use it in a smaller TF?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
The method is sound in logic. Anybody having coding skills should help out with the trend line to rule out most objectivity and save time.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
He is Basque not Catalan, close but not the same lol have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hola Tnavi, Saludos desde Alicante. I just want to share here this indicator, which draws automatically trendlines and shows possible targets too. I would use normal candelsticks instead of HA bars in order to see real PA but it´s up to everyone. Thank you Tnavi. Cheers

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Can you tell me please which pairs do you trade? And people trendlines are not that subjective, we make them subjective, they do not have to match exactly all the points as if we were designing a plane, just a visual line, just draw the line as you see it, also the HA candles can help you to do this, yes sometimes you will be wrong but many, many times your trendline will be accurate , specially on daily charts, believe me I have been trading this style of price action since many years ago and with practice the lines will be appearing more clearer, short trendlines on daily charts are much much accurate than any lagging indicator you would be tempted to add. Regards

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Dear friend "tnavi" Thanks "Reply to your-How much u need---obviously MAXIMUM " waiting eagerly for your IDEA , you can PM me. ~Thanks &amp; regards

--- 帖子 #73 ---
i paint the trendlines with hands, yes. if u want u can prove in smaller TF, but probably the results may be worse

--- 帖子 #74 ---
one of the points that i created this thread, is to compare entries with the rest of comrades. we can help us with the entries because trendlines are very subjetives.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
muchas gracias Caillou por el indicador for now i prefer to draw without indis my trendlines

--- 帖子 #76 ---
i trade basically eurusd, gbpusd, audusd and usdchf. reason? because with 3 pairs we have correlation trends; if eurusd goes up, gu and au would goes up too and then, usdchf pair down. eurusd pair is the most important pair and gbpusd is very strong. not is crazy pair as gbpjpy and i can take quiet trends. audusd is normally a quiet pair and usdchf too. a couple can give us clues about the other pairs

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Ok as I said and I insist that trendlines are not that subjective on daily charts, also as I said that HA candles can help you to visualized when a trend change, and for the indicators adicts you can use Nihilist as suggested to visualy confirm the trend change, TP and SL you will have to use your own judgement, Its a matter of experience and I think It should not be mechanical. It is not rocket science, some of the trends will no be very good but most of them by simple eyes will be very good. I know that It is easy to trade past charts, this is just an example of how you can practice drawing lines or start foward testing on a demo account with your trendlines. Use only daily charts, lower ones will have a lot of market noise. Open any daily chart and start drawing your trend lines and please dont overthink this is another traders mistake.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Can you trade the 5 min time frame on this system or do you get multiple Nihilist_Ultra_Trend_V2.ex4 bars changing all at once ie repainting Also someone said that he was trading at 0.04 pips a point 100 pips = $40 This maths is incorrect answer is $4

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Yeah, you are right about the correlations.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I would highly recommend you trade it exactly like tnavi and use the higher time frames only like 4H, Daily, Weekly! You will make many more pips much easier with less screen time and less stress. Just be patient and hold onto your positions longer and let them ride on those higher time frame charts...trust me you will be amazed at the difference compared to the 5M charts! Remember patience is the key and it won't hurt to also understand how to use the Fibonacci Retracement and Expansion Tools!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
You are absolutely correct with everything you said

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Oh, I'm sorry I do not have much knowledge of the region...LOL! I do have a very close friend who lived in Madrid Spain when he was a child

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Thanks, there are a lot of trading styles, but this type of trading is what has given me results since many years ago, specially when I took out those lagging indis. Regards and many pips

--- 帖子 #84 ---
No you did not read well, i said he was trading a contract of 0.04 (micro) which means 1pip=0,4cent. Do the math

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Interesting thread, wish you goodluck to your journey.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yes, exactly. this indicator is made for higher tf like H4 to weekly.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
thankx for this simple early entry Idea Q) i only paint trendlines. -- ? how do you paint your nice TLs in mt4 ? -- mine are- over long- Weak looking red lines.. From as circled in yellow other chart from other poster ugly lines everywhere

--- 帖子 #88 ---
silver looks close to a break

--- 帖子 #89 ---
This is exactly the problem I said people could get in , to seek perfectly beautiful lines, you said you are "painting" in the chart. The chart I posted you have to see the lines where they start and not to see where they end as I also dont know how to limit the lines on mt4, the idea of the author is to show you that even on daily charts there are many opportunities, this is why I supposted he called the thread "scalping on 1 day charts" In your beautiful esthetic chart paint you would have gotten only 2 opportunities in 5 months in that pair, in the example I posted there were several, again It was just an example so people could see how many opportunities there are also on daily charts. We are not making lines to paint a masterpiece, we are just drawing visual lines to identify as many chances to get into the market on daily basis and with the help of one indicator according to the authors thread.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Here's how to adjust your trend lines in MT4/MT5: 1. After Single clicking OR double clicking on your trend line, right-click on it then select "Trendline properties" and then select the Parameters Tab. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2. Uncheck the "Ray" checkbox if you want to manually adjust your trendline's length to your own liking by making it smaller and more compact. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3. If you want you can also quickly "clone" or make a copy of objects like trendlines and any other MT4/MT5 chart objects by pressing and holding the "Ctrl" Key while left clicking and dragging. This will create a duplicate object. Do this to quickly create many, many trendlines or other objects and then you can change the colors, lengths for certain ones if you like. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I hope that helps

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thanks for your useful information. Regards

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thank you very much for your words. Is a honor to have you here thanks for ur work

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Ok, silver has breaks the trendline. good moment to add to your notebook. now u need to wait to UT indicator turns green. then go long, the MM is ur problem

--- 帖子 #94 ---
the intention of this method is caught all small/big possible movements of the price in 1 day chart. in this usdjpy chart i see a lot of entries....u not?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
thanks for explain so good.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
whether or not you know it, you're a trend follower...

--- 帖子 #97 ---
another tren follower, yes. we are small fish and need follow the big shark to live. this is all...simple and effective

--- 帖子 #98 ---
i want create a trade explorer but i cant. what im doing wrong? the only message that it give me is "imposible connect". i need to config. something in tm4??

--- 帖子 #99 ---
You might need to wait until the WEEK, when the market is open, to try and create a TE...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
This is exactly what I said, and It is what I have been doing for living since many, many years ago, I like simplicity like your method, Its not exactly my method because I dont use indicators, but I like yours because in some way It is similar to mine. And of course that I see a lot of entries in that pair, others are looking for a perfect entry as if taking a trade were like a rocket lunch science, they overthink and this is exactly when many traders fail. Your method is simple and effective and this is why I like it. Regards

--- 帖子 #101 ---
i had been trying during the week to create the TE and doesnt work for me...Tomorrow i will saw u

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Sorry, sometimes my english compresion not is so good.is a pleasure to me to know that are many traders that like this idea.thanks to all

--- 帖子 #103 ---
tnavi does this indicator repaint on current bar?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Dont worry, English is not my mother language either. Thanks for sharing your system.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
You're welcome!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Yes it does repaint on the "CURRENT" bar. When the bar closes, it does NOT repaint after that time. That is why you enter on the "OPEN" of the next bar after the signal bar, which should roughly equal the "CLOSE" of the signal bar. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thanks for explain (again) it better than me.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Happy I could help you in my small way. GREEN pips to you always

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Dear tnavi, Thank you for your great Thread. I have got ULTRA TREND v2.EX4 INDICATOR &amp; glory D1 chart Template. but after installing the indicator &amp; template in the daily chart shows only Heikin Ashi candlesticks &amp; the indicator. You have suggested to paint little trend lines so that it touch the glory. As i am a newbie it's difficult for me to do that. Would you kindly suggest how to do that? With Best Regards.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Out of all of the strategies I have found on here I find this one to be the most interesting. I trade on my phone only and I will be using fractals to help me draw TL. This will help me to stay consistent. We should compare charts

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi lesuer, I think you are drawing the trend lines a little off but I also could be wrong in saying this. This is how I have done them by looking at tnavi's chart. Hopefully someone will confirm for us. GL

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thank you tnavi for sharing this simple trading system with us. Will give it a shot and see how it works out. GL and happy trading.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Repainting indi = what comes out of bull's bottom.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Forexday, i started red drawing them like that, but they look a little "extreme" for me. I wanted more consistency and less subjectivity hence the fractals.... I guess if we all start showing our TL then we can get some feed back. I do like how your TL look, aswel as tnavi, I am just having a hard time drawing them in

--- 帖子 #117 ---
His TL look like 4 hr TL on a 1D chart

--- 帖子 #118 ---
But do you mean 00:00 New York time (EST) or London (GMT) or Tokyo (JST)? Or 17:00 New York (EST) which is the rollover start for a new forex trading day?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Go to the HP (dashboard) of MFXB (=myfxbook.com) - where you may find the correct time !

--- 帖子 #120 ---
When does the "Daily" candle open on your system??? Not everyone has the same "Daily" candle. It depends on your broker. My "Daily" candle opens @ 17:00 (EST) and works just fine. Others will have a different start time for their "Daily" candle. What is important is that you have to wait for the previous "Daily" candle to close so that the indicator will not 'repaint' any more. This will then give the proper signal based on the "Closing" price of the previous candle. Will you enter the new trade at exactly the "Closing" price of the previous candle? Not always. In the moments it takes to place the "Market" order to enter the trade the price may change. Sometimes in your favor, better fill. Sometimes against you. All in all it should average out. GREEN pips to you all.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
whats your risk ratio tnavi how much Tp you take and how much Sl you allowed for every trade you take?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Looks like there should be no set limit and let price action be your guid. He said he just draws another TL and waits for it to break. Two orders may be the way to go... One for short term and one to try to ride the longer wave

--- 帖子 #123 ---
do a back test and you will see there should be not set rule of thumb. There are a lot of 50 pip wins and a lot of 500 pip wins. Getting in is easy .... Management is the key if you cut yourself shy you could miss out on 100s and if you set to high you'll lose constantly alll I know is I am happy to have found this method.... I have been on ff for a year but have never found anything worth jumping on until now. I am gonna stick with this one until I master it because it looks that affective.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is my take on this method for uj. Whatcha think

--- 帖子 #125 ---
You're not in favor of the Heiken-Ashi?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Dont see the point... Nor do I see the point in the other indicator...

--- 帖子 #127 ---
so you can not put a big lot then if dont put a sl that will be dangerous no stoploss at all market move fast at least you must have a emergency stoploss

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I was focusing more on the tp side of things.... Haven't really thought of a good way to do stop loss... Maybe the low/high of the breakout candle. We need more SL input from tnavi

--- 帖子 #129 ---
So in what way does this have anything to do with this thread

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Can others go into more detail regarding these 4 pairs? EURUSD and USDCHF appear to have the highest negative correlation. GBPUSD and AUDUSD appear to lag EURUSD somewhat. Does EURUSD typically lead GBPUSD and AUDUSD on swings? thanks

--- 帖子 #131 ---
good monday to everyone. im going to close this short trade in eurusd. Attached Image (click to enlarge) why? because price has breaked the trendline and gbpusd and audusd are hitting strong to the other side (up). is moment to open a new long in eurusd? no. now, we need to wait to UT indi turn to green to enter. be patient.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
audusd pair goes up slowly but very good. im in since 20.10...remember Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #133 ---
in gbpusd may be had a possible pull back and was good moment to enter long. Attached Image (click to enlarge) we will see during the week.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Dear CT, does this indicator work for gold commodity?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
and how eurusd, this usdchf long will close. Attached Image (click to enlarge) price breaks too the trendline but we need to wait that UT turns red in this case to enter short. small losses and maybe, big gains.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
really appreciate your good work,i have installed the template but i dont have the trend line drawn i have attached what i see on my chat ,please what can i do to see the trendline s like i see in your post.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Good morning! these are my charts. on some of them I think I entered too early, we are here to learn to trade... and history if it is possible as well. Comander365 trend lines are drawn manually sir.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi ,You have to draw the TL by yourself, search for some TL indi,there are plenty out there,your TL will not be the same as others, will differ slightly

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thanks Tnavi for simple and good system. i am watching USDCAD.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
[Quote = joancb; 7825691] Buenos días! estas son mis cartas. en algunos de ellos creo que entré demasiado pronto, estamos aquí para aprender a comerciar ... y la historia si es posible también. Líneas de tendencia Comander365 se dibujan manualmente señor. {Image} {image} {image} {image} {image} [/ quote] bones joan, AUDCAD and gbpusd look good, I think it meet to perfection system rules. you waited at the close of the daily candle to make the entry? for example in gpbusd, we should expect confimarcion nihilist green candle at the end of the day today no?

I've been away from forex for quite some time due to time constraints and having lost a substantial sum. Forex is not as easy to learn as it would seem. Nice system here, Tnavi, for those who have regular jobs and can't be around the computer for too long. This system follows the price, and one can easily follow the trend by looking at the weekly and monthly charts. For those who want to switch to the four hour candles, they can easily do that and get in and out a little faster, and stay in if the pair keeps moving in their favor. Mot a lot of action with a daily system, but patience pays off.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
hi joan. usdchf entry is very early entry, im waitting to enter too but not is the better now. gbpusd long is a good entry. audcad is a late entry because you would entered some days before. eurjpy entry can be a good entry eurusd is a early entry too. im waitting to entry here green pips.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
i think that could be better taking the trendline like this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) and exit whe green TU appeared when day ends.

thanks for ur words paradoxical. i have a little children and a long journey job then i dont have much time to be in front of pc. i have goods methods to trade with london market opens but i dont have the courage to left all to trade this. with this method i can be with my family, work and make a "normal" life only having my iphone into my pocket. green pips.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I agree with you 100%. What I like about the system you've developed is that the chart is very easy to read and understand and pleasing to the eye. It doesn't rely on a bunch of other indicators for confirmation that also sometimes confuse a trader. What you're also doing is waiting for the pair to come to you, instead of forcing the trade and getting in early, and having it be a false breakout, thereby losing pips. It is also easy to change the time periods and look at the weekly and monthly trends and follow those instead of going against them. For the times I can be around a computer during the trading session I'm in (U.S.), I can always see if there are any possibilities on the H4 charts. Congrats again. A very good, very simple, easy to follow and understand system, that follows the price and trend without a lot of other indicators to be concerned about. I would rather be in two trades that are winning than be in and out of the market constantly on lower time frames, and adding indicators and filters that often serve to confuse and make you second guess.

tnavi,have I drawn the TL on the right place here,or should it be closer to the down trend? I like this system ...

--- 帖子 #160 ---
testing the system, target 500 pips..

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi, tnavi. Bro you've introduce a very cool stuff here... I've tried out on GU daily today and it turn to green pips. Thanks for sharing, hope everyone here fully utilize this great work by tnavi.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
yeah, is in a good place. in a previous post u can see my gbpusd enter to compare with your TL

--- 帖子 #163 ---
why 500?

tnavi... Thanks for the thread and your efforts. PM me and I can try and walk you through the trade explorer.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
The Ultra Trend indicator at the bottom is not green. I don't think that is a trade as yet.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I am a silent observer of this thread, thanks Tnavi to share the simple system, gr8 thing is it is based on Nihilist UT which itself is a gr8 indicator. I just want to add that Gold can definitely be traded with this system, not Gold but any pair I believe although I have not tested all the pairs but this is based on simple trendlines so either you will have small loss, small profit or big profit, no chances of having big losses.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
If you look closely at his chart he sold. Therefore he wants the indicator to be red. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
You're right. I didn't see he was going short as the trend line was up.

Hi Tnavi... I cant upload this indicator....is it free or need to buy first... Plz help me to get this indi...thanks

--- 帖子 #174 ---
thanks mvp77 but doesnt work. with my real account, i can change the pass but with the other demo account it doesnt let me. when i downloaded the mt4 from deltastock, i didnt use any pass to connect and now i dont know what is

--- 帖子 #175 ---
thanks for ur words spyderman. the problem is that i cant change the past password because i dont know what is when i close all the trades, i will download again the mt4 program and i will try again. thanks!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
deltastock on the trade explorer list... there is 2 way to go... 1. you trade demo, and forget to write up your investor password when created account.....solution open new demo. 2. you trade real account, and forget your investor assword.....solution check with support what it is either way, if you really want to create that trade explorer, it isn't difficult

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Please ignore my Sl and TP , as i'm just testing the system. Just follow as stated by the author (TNAVI). Good Luck !

Look promising. Multiple time frame would work great to time accurate entry, although not 100%. Could someone share the result for this technique? Appreciate.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
ummmm this can be a very good short!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Thanks for the good system but, i would like to know the best entry time and how to fix stop loss

--- 帖子 #191 ---
This short starts to boot ... +25 pips now

--- 帖子 #192 ---
ure welcome men.the sl not are defined. When you are playing a wave, draw a trendline and when price crosses this TL, u can exit

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Just a thought regarding multiple time frames for entry as repeatedly noted above, a 10x21 ema cross seems very viable on 1 hr and 15 min entries and makes the stoploss more manageable. So, the daily can be used as a SIGNAL when price meets the criteria as noted in the thread....but the lower timeframes could serve as the ENTRY....again, just an idea, don't want to impose on the system AS IS.....

eurusd chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) when candle closes if we have a green block, we would enter long.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I see that. It looks like there was a steep rise that resulted in an engulfing candle over the previous red candle. That would make sense on a trend indicator, but it is important to know this as just looking at the red, green or grey lines doesn't mean the line necessarily closed that color and stayed that way in real time. They do, however, show the trend of the pair.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
i had been playing with this indicator since Nihilist master uploaded and i never had a problem (in 5 min chart).

be careful with this gbpcad long. if candle closes in red UT, is better to close and wait again.

Yeah, it had just switched to double green at the daily rollover. Then with the news this morning it shot down and rolled over to red. I'll definitely keep an eye on it.

Hi all, i've made a little mtf-dashboard for the Nihilist_Ultra_Trend_v2 indicator and with tnavi's approval i want to share it with you. I hope it's useful for someone?! greetings robcole

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Tnavi, just noted that your USDCHF chart's UT have turn red but mine still not. May be because of the different broker. Can you let me know which broker are you using? Thanks N Best Regards.

At what Price you opened these two trades please?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
As Tnavi says is better to use UT on D1 TF, but 1 red or green square is not indicative of a trend change, the system works good because the trend line drawn always marks a trend change after 2 or 3 candles, once the trend is confirmed by UT. Thanks for sharing

Hi Navi, Thanks for sharing this nice simple system.....I been trying this out past few days and have been getting good results on AU and NZ pairs Can I get your advice on the attached image below for EUR/AUD short, what do you think? Is this a valid entry point and safe to short? Cheers mate

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Looks like we long EUR/USD?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Yes - that trade looks good for sure, looks like a solid setup.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Correct me if I am wrong but it looks like not only the current bar will repaint, but also the previous bar. Look at the EUR/USD double green. Yesterday, the previous Nihilist bar (current that time) was black. The same applies to GBP/CAD which turned from double green to black and red.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Try not to count the bar before it has closed. In other words, there is no valid double green on Eur/Usd.... Yet. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Sorry to ask this but having a hard time loading this indicator to where the plateform can load it onto charts. Any suggestions or point me in the right direction. Thanks

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Sorry, but the PREVIOUS bar to the current one does repaint sometimes, after the current bar has closed. No question about it. I have seen it happen several times, and tested it on 5m charts to confirm, by marking each 5m bar just after it has closed with an UP or a Down arrow, and checking them later to see any changes. It is a concern, and could certainly induce taking false trades, but I would just trade as per the system, because there is no way to avoid the re-paint. Hopefully the risk/reward ratio, and the fact that the repaint does not happen every time will overcome any losses caused by it.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
looks like a good entry. maybe a little late, but very good

--- 帖子 #242 ---
im in too. im going to prove this pair. thanks for advice, spyderman

--- 帖子 #243 ---
ure welcome, this is a very late entry. this would be better. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

what is ur broker? i dont have this last two bars....only one. i will entered short this tonight

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Yes this indi repaints stated even by the author, It does not repaint as bad as others, but sometimes repaints, this is why the indicator must be foward tested and not back tested. The most important thing of this system is the trend line break, the ultratrend is just for a visual confirmation for those who need something extra to confirm.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Yes agree with that. Just need to be aware of the possibility of a repaint. Some indies are so bad, as to make them untradeable. This is not the case here. A useful tool.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hey paradoxical, please have a look for the version of Nihilist_Ultra_Trend indicator. Maybe you are using version v2.1 ? Please download version 2 from this thread, the dashboard should work then...

UT indicator can help us as a filter. if u are playing a wave and finally a candle breaks the trendline, how know if u need to enter long or short? in this case UT indi help us a lot. Attached Image (click to enlarge) trust me, when a candle ends, is very very rare that ut indi repaints.

to all people, i have playing with this indicator since Nihilist upload. if u want, i can upload some videos of how i played in 5 min chart with very good results. here u can see how i made rich

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Sure, it would be really appreciated

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Thanks for the feedback Navi, I actually went in earlier today and closed at about 30 pips at 0.5 lot size It went to 50 pips but you know what they say cant catch every trade in this forex game. I will keep in mind next time for better entry, I still think EA going down more tho as AU is strong and I was long in AU already. If long AU, then short EA = good combo. Yes a video will be nice for 5min.....sometimes I use your strategy for 5min and it seems very good for scalp mate.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Be interesting to see that.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I was looking at this trade now - are you short now on this trade? I want to short this but not sure if to late or still ok? Looks ok but FOMC later today can make or break this trade mate....... I got screwed last time on FOMC lol

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hello tnavi, really interesting thread. I have to say, after all the chasing around I've been doing, multiple indicators and setup's, I keep coming back to trendline breaks as the most reliable predicator as to future price. I still have a couple of ema's on my charts, not really sure why, I guess the charts look so empty otherwise after the mess I was used to in the past ! I really like doing these setups on the 60 min, there was a prime example of one yesterday on USDCAD. I've also looked at the trend indicator you've posted and this does seem to add something. My question though is that a hate metatrader with a passion and was wondering whether it's possible to get the indicator on Tradestation. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hola amigo desde Madrid. A very simple system. Question: Why did you set your TP on USDCAD at 1.10?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Navi, trying to test this on a 5min chart for a nice quick scalp, which of the below images is a better setup? Can you advise, seems to work well on 5min as already in profit again Did I draw my lines ok?

Hi Tnavi Very interesting system and very very simple to apply. Some backtests prove that it is working perfectly well. For today it is a bit risky to take position before the results of FOMC. Regarding your last post, i can't access to the video. Do anyone else has the same issue?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
You can use VLC to play that file. @tnavi: interesting scalping strategy, similar to mine but i aim for more pips in a move and just use candlesticks plus S/R and TL. I have some questions: it seems you base your entrys on break of minor S/R and if UT is same colour am i right? How do you base your exit points? Don't you need candle close after the break for confirmation? I ask because im not expert at heiken_ashi Great work by the way, keep going! You should really quit your job and start trading full time

--- 帖子 #278 ---
thanks for ur words, jojo. but with a little baby and with a lot of pays all months, i dont have enough eggs to do that.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Thanks finnaly saw it with VLC Nice strategy.... For TP you have a fix number of pips? How you manage stoploss, or when exit your trade is not goes in your direction? Thanks

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Ye, it's though i know right! But i always think what market teach to use: withouth a risk, can not be a success Let's make our accounts growth for a welthy life and for freedom!!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
and yes, for example if price breaks below, the last support area and UT indi is red, is a good moment to enter short.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Can this also be done with the 1min charts Navi or is it to much noise? Seems to work ok for 1min chart....but I make sure I get out quick tho..... 5-10 pips.... if more is good but if I scalp I only take that lol

--- 帖子 #283 ---
which one you prefer to do scalping in 5 min or scalping in daily ?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
i prefered 5 min charts because 1min has a lot of "sound".tp has around 5 pips

--- 帖子 #285 ---
i love 5 min charts scalp, but since 2 years ago i dont have time to do that.when i have a day free, i play yet with this method.i have another real account that grow when i have time

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I agree, as I said the main signal is the break of the trendline, and I also said ultratrend repaints (stated by the author, he also recomends to foward test this indi, and he even created two more filters which dont repaint for ultratrend to avoid false entries, and later he created even more to not depend only with ultratrend on his system),It rarely repaints, but It does, I did a lot of testing with a simulator because I was subscribed in Nihilist thread, I am not saying that it is a Bad indicator, but sometimes even if the candle is closed and suddenly there is change direction of the price the last closed bar will dissapear, I use daily charts on my trading so I foward tested on daily charts and I also used a simulator, again this indicator is a good one but It repaints sometimes and your system I think is very good because of its simplicity. Regards

--- 帖子 #287 ---
with m5 u will be a looser with that strategy. works only H4, daily etc.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Not really mate, you just have to be smart about it and not stay in long....that's whole point of scalping... 5-10 pips hits nearly all the time with that strat....if you lose no dramas as you can't win them all... But I agree more accurate on longer TF. Small TF I use to perfect my entry and scalp when I can.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
And definitely stay out now and hope you guys on sideline as FOMC is making the pairs go CRAZEH Wait till settle before going in again..... Unless u guys are in the right direction and wish you all the best !

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Never mind. I found the answer in another thread. Does anyone else was a problem with downloading an indicator for MT4 and it not show up in the indicators. I am using windows 7. I have just started having this problem. It is driving me nuts. I go in the properties for the file and it is Blocked and I unblock it and check it again and it shows still blocked. Can anyone help with this please.. I am trying to download and install the Nihilist_Ultra_Trend_V2.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
IF you buy here ouch thats why we need a tight stoploss look at this one 100+pips in mins!!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Yeh I agree, which is why you dont trade news cuz it can either make you or break you......its a flip of a coin really.... The trade did go well long according to the indicator and I was already out a few days ago which I am very thankful to God......FOMC had to mess everything up lol.... I hope you people that went long got out safely with nice pips + profit or if you did take a hit was minimal.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
If you are scalping you have to have all components of the trade in your favor. In addition you have to know where the walls exist in the market. Think of the market as a car if you drive it into concrete wall it will stop. How do you define walls and their strength in the market? How do you identify them? What are some characteristics of a wall? Scalping: Which currency pair are you scalping? What is the spread? What is the average movement (per day, week, time frame)? How much movement does the pair give back per time frame? If you can begin to answer these questions you may have a shot at scalping successfully if not you are just prolonging the inevitable of a blown up account with successive losses that you cant make up.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Agree, also there was the FOMC Metting, and never,never trade before this event. If you are already in profit you can set your stop loss with some gains , knowing that the news will make your position hit your stop loss or will increase your gains, in that case you could take a chance but if your position is new close it before this type of events.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I have tried to trade with Nihilist ultra trend indi before but the repainting issue was alarming regardless of the time frame be t daily or 4hrly, so i abadoned it. As simple as this system is, to have a winner in the long run, a way must be devised to cut or filter the whipsaws 70% of the time.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
whoaah! what happened to EU? there was two green bars already when i buy. when i wake up this morning its already two red bars. Thats what you say no repainting??

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Nah EU got fucked cause of FOMC mate.......longs was fine 2 days ago if you manage to exit before drop.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I'm a little confused. As a bar is building, I can see that an indicator can change back and forth. However, when a bar closes, everything is based on the closed, can't be changed, price. How then, can an indicator repaint after the bar closes?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
very nice i like thanks Tnavi so fractals give us a consistent way to make a line trend here one friend give us the idea

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Many of these type of indies do backwards repaint. This one is one of the lesser repainting ones, but it still does to an extent. Not sure if it could be made to NOT repaint, but there is probably a reason why it can't. That is why back-testing with this type of indie does not work. Better to forward test, or use a simulator.

GU also right man ? so pls give us some reason for your Choice EU instead of GU

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Any indicator that repaints after a bar has closed (ie. "locked-in") is as much use to me as a chocolate teapot. I simply don't see the point in relying on something that can't be relied on.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Thanks for sharing this system tnavi, my first trade hit SL on GU because of usd News, hope to make some money later.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Are you going to use the the same strategy of your video? Is there a way to look at how your chart was after the trade? (i mean with indicators on it) Thanks.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
i dont entered in gu pair because i arrived late.this is the only reason

--- 帖子 #315 ---
this video is for another method.normally, into the 5 min charts i dont have problems with ut indi but into 1 day chart i have a lot

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Can you post or show with some screenshots the exact rules you use to enter and exit a trade on 5min TF? Regards!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
This broke yesterday. BE careful strong resistance

Thavi good job! But i don't understand how to fix my TP. You take 100 or more pips or you just look when indicator recolor ?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hey my freind, the two upper indis on your chart are they repainting too?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Are you saying that 5mins UT dosnt repaint?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
look this. is 4 minutes ago. 7 quicks pips. UT indicator works very good to motivate me in the trade. https://mega.co.nz/#!LlhE1JzI!0DU4NK...E6lBsmeqPvJdAM but in 1 day chart, fall

maybe it repaints too....but works better than in 1 day chart

I guess you haven't been following this forum at all. He just was able to open a trade explorer with a new demo account, so that those that are interested can follow along. Your quick judgement and ridicule are uncalled for and show a lack of maturity. GREEN pips to all.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I see, basically breakouts and colours matches. And you go for about 10pips if m not wrong. It make sense, gonna test this out

--- 帖子 #326 ---
No ESOSA they don't. as long as the candle is closed. they can change while the current candle is forming.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
IF you read the thread you would know that he just opened his trade explorer. You only read what you wanted. This is a simple and good system specially for the working class that can only trade day charts. Just look at the charts.

Day late... but it failed to break R on bounce so entered with limit order few hours ago. TP @ lower 2dev bb on 4h and daily. Could go lower of course but yesterdays bullish hammer... Moving SL to BE. Nice thread...don't get too distracted with the 5m scalping

Hey guys! Anybody know how to modify Ultra Trend so when it changes color it will alert? I think that will be helpful instead of staring at the screen all day. Green pips!

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Just a few thoughts on repainting of indicators. Been on a lot of threads over the years here at FF and many get crazy about indicators repainting Don't sweat it so much...it's just a matter of perspective. Even if an indicator eventually repaints, it's telling you what its designed to at the time of the signal . No indicator can predict what price will do in the future...just what it might do based on where its heading at a point in time. And some are designed to repaint based on their calculations (for example, if it's using some kind of weighted average) Take those trades made before the FOMC. They were valid long entries as of price action at the time. The indicator's not to blame for the FOMC crashing the USD pairs. That's the fault of those willing to stay in through the news (yes...like me... ) Now granted that repainting makes it difficult, and with some indicators nearly impossible, to backtest. But forward trading is fine. So tnavi has been using this indicator...trading forward...for some time now and he finds it reliable. So, that's good now for me. I'll try it out and see how it flies. Just my thoughts.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
how did u this?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
curosiusly, UT indi works very fine with 5 min charts. u can see this perfectly,....but sometimes, in 1 day chart makes some extrange things....

--- 帖子 #341 ---
This to me does not make sense, it's basically a get out of jail free card for the indicator. If a trade works out, the indicator's great. If it doesn't, what can you expect, circumstances changed after it plotted. The whole point is that an indicator is there to give you guidance at the time you are required to make a decision. If a trade doesn't work out, so be it, not all of them do. You're trying to get probability and logic on your side and I think we can all agree that nothing is 100% infallible. If an indicator is "designed to repaint" it serves no purpose. Even if it's not designed to do so but still does on occasions, it serves no purpose. Rant over, I still like trendline breaks though!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
please my friend can you share the two indicators?

what can u tell me about 10.2 tmaslope? it repaint too?

dear tnavi , my MT4 Plattform can not open the "Nihilist_Ultra_Trend_V2.ex4", can you pleas provide the file Indicator "Nihilist_Ultra_Trend_V2.mq4" . thank you

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi tnavi, Here's what I've ben working on as I discussed with you by PM. I hope the image below explains what I'm trying to do. Any questions, or you don't think it's approriate for the thread just let me know.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
thank you very much Steve for upload all the files and ur method. Favorite uploaded the babon slope. this is a fantastic indicator. Finally, it doesnt repaints! we can play with it without surprises. Attached Image (click to enlarge) is the same thing that Steves. what do u think?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
The purpose it serves (depending on the indicator) is served at the time of the signal. Using the ultratrend as an example, if it gives a bullish signal, then the parameters that made it signal are bullish at this time and place. I can now choose to take that bullish trade based on what the indicator is telling me...possibly along with other factors (i.e. trendline break) Now if 10 minutes after I place the trade, Mr. Big Shot hedge fund manager, decides to dump 5 billion euros back into the market (or the FOMC gets crazy ), then price is going to fall and the indicator may repaint...especially on a still open bar. It's not a case of the indicator being no good...market conditions have changed...in this case radically.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
There's been endless discussions in Nanningbob's threads on the tmaslopes repainting. Don't even get him started... His reasoning is similar to what I've stated. It works for trading in the here and now as it tells you what the market is (or more accurately, has) been doing up till this point in time.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
As I mentioned, there are indicators "designed to repaint". For example a simple MA...say 20 periods...obviously doesn't repaint. It's taking the average of the last 20 periods and projecting that as a point on the chart. But what about a weighted MA. Now to be honest I don't have a lot of experience using them...certainly not programming them, but logic dictates that if they're weighted to the current side then they will have to repaint. If the previous 20 weighted has been plotted and now you get a huge move on the current bar then those last few bars average will change (due to the weighting) and so the indicator has to repaint. It sucks for backtesting but that's not why most indicators were written. The are "indicators" as to what the market is doing... Again...just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi tnavi, Babon Slope - (T_S_R)-Signal Line - Hull Moving Average is the same indicator with different names. A 10 EMA would work, more or less the same, I like the other indicator it's just a personal thing. I haven't done any live trading with this yet but it certainly looks promising. Using the 21 MA keeps you in line with the current trend and when used with the Ultra Trend Indicator, as a trade filter, helps to eliminate false moves. But nothing is perfect; it's a matter of finding the best comprimise between speed and and accuracy.

hello every one, with this system should we play with ways or see some strong weekly SR ?i see tnavi use Heiken Ashi candlestick to follow trend, so we should exit trade when it change colour or any kind of exit ?any one have experence with exit by Heiken Ashi indicator ?

maybe someone can help me, how can I use the indicator in the plattform MT4. I push the file "Nihilist_Ultra_Trend_V2.ex4" in the folder of MT4 -Indicators. If I then start the platform, then the indicator is not visible and therefore I can not use it in the chart. How do you do it?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Tomek11 - You have to put the indi in the right folder. I have something like this below. Maybe You uploading Your indi to the wrong folder.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hi tomek, You need to open Navigator, then look for the indicator you want on your chart and then click and drag that indicator onto your chart.

now, im playing only with babon slope indicator. EURGBP short. Attached Image (click to enlarge) why? indicator turned to red and price crosses the near support. is a good moment to try.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
tomek11 here is the indi..

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I agree. If there was a Holy Grail indicator that worked 100% of the time for the masses, very soon thereafter it wouldn't work because too many people would be doing the same thing and that would create an imbalance in the markets. This indicator can repaint one or more bars in the past depending on the speed of movement of the pair. For instance, on a 5 minute chart if things were just bumping along and the pair was going down a little just enough to make a few red bars and suddenly some news came out that the economy of that country was turning upward dramatically, people start jumping on it and buying that currency making the previous red bar turn blue. When even more people jump on the news, the bar before that can turn from red to blue. This is like a rope that may have been lying flat on the ground and all of a sudden someone yanks on it from above, so that it pulls the FORMER flat rope upwards, turning it from red or gray to green. I look at the Nihilist Ultra trend as a potential trade and then look at the trend of the pair and generally take trades that follow the longer term weekly or monthly trend. I used to trade against the trend no matter what but now won't do that unless it has been reversing trend for at least a week or more.

Hi P.Dean, thank you for your input. i never use it on lower then 4H tf. thanks.

tnavi and tk5 must be kindred spirits. is honored to have the privilege to learn from this two excellent traders. The breaking of HA with tnavi`s TL`s are very similar to that observed with TK5 5EMA shift2 behavior. The difference in concepts might lie in confirmation filters: can be TA or indicators. The trader could benefit from the best of both worlds. thank you both.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
entry strategy both M5 and D1 seems clear, but the output?

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Lets stick to the system now that you have your trade explorer on so we can keep track of the results, at least on that account Just my thoughts of course as it is your thread so you can do anything you please.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Bad news from Canada and good news from great britain stopped me out of my GBP/Cad trade with only a few pips profit. sometimes price will retrace back to the original trendline that broke. This can be a good place to get in at times as long as a trendline is not broken in the opposite direction. So I decided to get back in and I am looking for a close below the original trendline that broke in yellow . This is fairly risky But the reward could be great if price takes off to the downside.Only time will tell. Have a great weekend everyone!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi Tnavi, which settings are you using for this indicator?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
OK. I thought someone posted that it did repaint from red to green on a closed bar. I didn't check, so I assumed that was true.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi laksior, You've got the main idea also look out for pullback candles that don't change colour or break the 21 MA.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Ok, let's clear. You mean that I don't have to worry about this pullbacks and don't exit in this moment? Of course I'm sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi laksior, I mean after a pull back, like I've highlighted above, you can also place a follow on trade. I wouldn't recommend taking every follow on trade, I only use 0.25% or 0.50% of my bank per trade to allow for follow on trades or having multiple trades open at once.

hi friends! first to all, sorry for not answer yesterday....was a very hard friday for me im going to make a little resume from my view of the market. firstly, say that im only using now Babon Slope indicator because looks like a good indi to filter the entries and be all the time as possible into the wave. AUDUSD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) BS indicator is red, but im waitting that price breaks this trendline to enter short. im only playing with the candles and not with the bars, why? Heiken Ashi indicator is a very usefull indicator. i only want to enter into the market in the first time of the day (00:01 hours). If i draw the lines with the bars, i can lose a los of pips. I only need the candles body form to make the TL. (sorry again for my English ) is very, very important to wait to 00:01 hours to enter, because with heiken ashi indicator u can have a bad entries.

Is anyone here looking at potential YEN pairs setup....maybe good for short opportunities if the signal goes off after yesterdays fiasco......YEN pairs move like a few hundred pips in a day lol.... Atm cant make heads or tails where the indicator is going.....

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hey Tnavi! first of all I have to say a big thank you for opening your thread!!! I really appreciate your view onto trading My question: Would you be so kind to point me to the post where I can download the BS indicator (the new slope indi you are using now) thank you very much in advance!

--- 帖子 #396 ---
In my experience it's very dangerous to trust just one indicator how you are doing with this BS Indi. I have back tested it and sure enough there are a lot of times you are going to score a loss. There has to be other indi to confirm entry. The break of tend line is a start but we need a confirmation of entry.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
There will always be losers - that's unavoidable. In my opinion, adding more indicators is almost never the right solution.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
If using one indicator is very dangerous, what about trading with no indicator (naked trading) at all? What tnavi is doing here is trading using simple price action (keep it simple stupid!) and the indi itself is just for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #399 ---

The confirmation of entry was given by Nihilist indicator. I've tried this strategy for the last past week on daily tf and i would say it can be very profitable if used with a bit of knowledge of price action and S/R levels ( i can't figure out why tnavi is changing it) I can post some screen about the trades i got last week if you wish

Update on GBPCHF trade SL move to BE. trade floating at 125 pips.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hi. I agree with this wholeheartedly. I literally decided to sign up just to say this. A little bit of S/R and PA on the Daily with the original method as confirmation would've made a killing on all YEN pairs.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Great Trade, also take a look at the pin candle just before It went up, these type of candles on daily charts are very informative, if you put together all these warnings they become more powerful than 15 lagging indicators.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
If you tell me that you are using the BS indi with Nihilist indi, that is a good idea. Jojofx i have also ran this indi in the D1 TF along with S/R levels. This Is A more solid Entry than just going off of just one indi.

Took some more trades today. This DeMarklines indicator that draws my trend lines and TP levels is working very good with my other idicators

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I rely for the most on price action. The Nihilist indicator is just the confirmation that the micro-trend has started. I don't think to need anything else. Plus i think BS is a bit lagging as MAs. Using both these 2 indicators on a daily will delay too much the entry and the most of the time it will be too late except if you catch long trends. Happy trading folks!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I've just had a quick look at this, I wouldn't be happy trying to trade this using the Babon Slope set to 13-3-0 there would be too much chop for me. I've added the Nihilist Holygrail Indicator, which doesn't re-paint, and trade only the direction of the Holygrail Indicator. I've changed the Babon Slope to 21-1-0 and wait for pullbacks in the trend and only take trades in the direction of the Holygrail Indicator. This approach is more conservative.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Thanks for your input Steve, your suggestions are always sound in my honest... quick question if you will, do you now personally feel that the Holygrail Indi is more suitable than the Ultra trend v2 Indi. I am currently back-testing with Ultra Trend.All the best to you.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Pipraider, I've run the Ultra Trend Indi. in back tests, using Strategy Tester, and when comparing the Histogram of the Ultra trend Indi., in Strategy Tester, with the Histogram of the Ultra Trend Indi., from my trading platform, there are quite a few discrepancies. These differences occur mostly when there is a sharp reversal in the market. The Holygrail Indi. doesn't react to the market so quickly but it doesn't repaint. I've only had a quick look at it, like I said, but it does look a more reliable filter and when using the Babon Slode Indi., set to 21-1-0, it seems to follow the Holygrail Indi. quite well.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Thank you Stevepatt, I am back testing long hand ugh!! time consuming unfortunately..."I'm not up to speed with the use of a Stategy Tester", I am so grateful to you, thank you, I will start again using Holy Grail Indi.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hello Stevepatt: I really like your approach with these indis. Process is wait for Holly indi to signal the trend, then wait for pullback and trigger at the low/high of previous candle? is it possible to share the Holly Grail Indi with us? Thanks and Happy Trading!

thank you very much, I noticed in your charts, they are all in 30 min, audnzd....do you scale down from the 4hr for entry?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I actually look at the Day time frame then the 4HR and 1HR and trade in direction of the day or the swing of the 4HR. There are 6 4HR candles in the Day chart and 24 1 HR candles in the day chart so I try and trade in direction of the day or with the 4HR swings.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi eaglefaith7, Thank you so much for sharing the details of your account - very impressive results! also, thank you for sharing the template and indicators that you use. I was wondering if you wouldn't mind sharing your actual Entry and Exit rules with us?

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I first look at the 1Day and 4HR charts and if the trend is the same in these I trade in that direction using the 1HR and 30 min for an entry. I look at the cycle Identifier indicator which gives a Dark Green for up or Dark red for down for a strong direction of the trend. The lighter green and red signals are normally retracement's . Also I us fibonacci for exits. I also look for the breaking of trend lines when entering. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Thanks again eaglefaith7! So looking at the AUDNZD chart at the moment, both the 1D and 4H have broken down. So you then wait for a short signal (using the cycle indi - red) on the 1H as the entry. It suggests an Entry at the moment - is that correct?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
yes you could have took a short on that, but also looking at the 4HR chart there was an up signal so I would not stay to long in that short trade. I would be looking to exit.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I my self would rather take the long trade on the 4HR as soon as the 1HR reverses. Then use my fibonacci tool for an exit at about the 50 percent.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
thanks but how do i draw the trendline,thats where am confused or do u have anyting that can draw the trendline for me authomtically?

i dont have rules for this threat. if u are more comfortable adding more indis, for me is okay. i will not say you nothing i have a little company and i dont have much time to spent with you. this method works, trust me. only follow the first rules. make "scalping" with 1 day chart. then, u can use the indi that u want to manage ur exits. cheers.!

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I got it. Thanks a lot!

@ eaglefaith Thank you very much @malejondrosf @ ukmartin You can find the last version attached @4xplosion You are perfectly right @BatmanXXL I don't use any SL or TP.In D1 charts, every 1H I check the trade.I close at brakes of TL ( like TNAVI recomended) @ MONAGHAN With all do respect. are you blind? Do you see xard system in the picture? I use a modiffied version of xard in my live account.Starting sunday I will use tnavi system on my second live account.The background color in the charts tells me what stoch. is doing.I attached a picture without stoch.Are you happy now? @popko Maybe you can share with us your trades?Some pictures? About additional indicators READ FARHAD10 ,post450. @ farhad10 You are perfectly right. My deepest respects for all of you Dan

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Dansmol no i am not blind, and due (do) is spelt as i have written it, also i am always happy except when i have to read rubbish from people like you

Many thanks Dansmol

Iam now looking at these two pairs... Basic System traded by tnavi. No changes at all!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Waiting for UT Signal

--- 帖子 #457 ---
An example of a looser one ; The 1st candle did not break the TL so should stay for the 2nd to close and then enter on the open of 3rd candle now look at the 3rd ! Yes it is a looser one although is with the confirmation of the UT ! comments appreciated.

I think you need to pick your battles carefully. Apart from a brief spurt down in September, this market has pretty much been ranging for the whole of this year with a few false breaks along the way. Compare and contast with last year where the market was trending nicely upwards from April onwards with numerous opportunities to get in following retracements. The bottom indicator is a stochastic from the weekly chart.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Yes exactly; wanted to note and emphasize that without knowing price action, you can not be a winner !( any system ) trade is not so simple like page one that when price break TL, look at UT, if red or green then jump into trade !! No, you will be a looser one if not pay attention to price action

--- 帖子 #461 ---
this is a chart and words of a very experimented person. thank u very much for post into this thread. green pips.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hello tnavi, thanks for sharing your method. I've been struggling with Forex for about 5 yrs, and had passed for many techniques. I'm now sure that I prefer to go with larger TF, so that's why I like your approach and simplicity. To be honest, I don0t see those many entries, and I'd like you to show us those many entries you see in the referenced chart. This will clear out many doubts I may have in my forex experience,... as I may want to see a retrace to then pull the trigger, but don't see any retrace here. Best

--- 帖子 #463 ---
maxtrader, would you be so kind to explain your methodology? Maybe open up a new thread, so we don't confuse people and keep respect on tnav's. Best

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hello Tnavi, thanks for opening another thread. I like this system as it is really simple with very little indi's. I have tried it on lower time frames and it looks promising. Hello Jeetvirk, I also like your chart, it is simple and does not need drawing of trend lines that are uncertain and inconsistent. The HMA indi you are using is looking really good here. I will be posting trades as from next week. Happy weekend and Happy Trading. Shalom!!

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Wasn't this an actual short setup 2 days ago? So, to be clear, your method now doesn´t use the indicator in the bottom anymore? and instead use the squiggly line? How do you use this line as a confirmation? Draw and break of trend line remains the same? Best regards

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Again, this trade to me was a long setup couple of days ago, considering a pullback from the main long trend. Any cpmment on this? (Puedes explicar en Español si te es mas facil) REgards

Hi Tnavi Do you mean that the strategy posted in the first post is no more working for you now?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hi to all.. hi Tnavi!-))..we now witch other from kos thread, im steel a basket trader, from ho dont now what about is basket trading, can fiend me on basket ea forum.. i trade group of valutes, and trade them on h1-h4 tf, now im whant to go with daily swing trades..so i read some post of tnavi thread-)), and found that he say that nihilist indi is repainting, so i decidet to show you my version of non repaiting indi and system of what you do here, i put my tpl from baskets on single pair..and this is what i have.. ixo is a non repainting indi, it very strong and powerfull tool, s/r lines is to a not repained indi, so is another important tool.. i dont use HA candels, they dont repeinting to, but i prefer to see the true candels, so i used just supertrend candles indi... and what this done for me? you see on the pic. nihilist trend indi i put it just for confirmations but not for enteres, not all the time..the ixo and the price above or below ma in color indi (10) is the key. https://charts.mql5.com/6/171/gbpusd...-limited-3.png So the rules are: 1)price above big HA smoothed( big MA), here we go just in buy trades price below this big MA-just short trades. 2)Let say price is below big MA(HA smoothed)...rule 2 is, to waiting the first candel below MA in color(10), with confimations of ixo and nihilist indi in the same directions..aaand the pricemust have some distance from s/r lines, this s/r line can be used like tp. for buy trades-same rules.

Hello Dansmol, Just wondering how your trades are doing? Still holding them? I wonder if you can post images of your 5 entries? Although they are profitable at the moment, to me looks like you where a bit late don't you? Are you using other indicator as an aid? Regards

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Dear cfabian I hesitated a little to post because there are people hwo are posting only to critic other people ,instead to post somethig constructiv and helpfull(see post of monaghan and popko ) But what a hell,I will answer your post, anyway. I close all the trades on demo. Now i'll tell you how I take my trades ( see the 2 pictures) 1-I look to currency strenght meter ,to see the pair with most chances to move 2-Chart D1-I look to direction of the candle 3-I look to ultra trend to be same color with candle 4- Candle must cross the TL 5-I have a fast look to MTF RSI(21),and to MTF ultra-trend dash. This take about 10 minutes, and after that I decide If I take the trade. Sorry , but english is not my first language. If you need ,I will post also the indicators. My respects Dan

Hello Shum, Good day, I tried to fix the chart as your templete "D1" and all your indicators,... but the problem was the setting seen different with your GU chart. I need the setting for all your indie,.. or even the same template you use,... Thanks, Budi

--- 帖子 #483 ---
please, put here your chart pict.. to see the difference. ixo must be sitting individual for each pair. another my sugestion will be to use 2 ixo, not just one, the second will have the less parametres, and it will be used for reenters in the trend. First enter its made when you have two ixo cros in the same direction, reenters(if you mes first enter) wil be made with cros of less ixo in the direction of big ixo.. Exit - cros change of color -big ixo. You mey try to use this system in h4 to. https://charts.mql5.com/6/189/eurusd...ri-limited.png

Why would you want to buy GBP if this indicator shows it`s going down. Same thing with AUD. Indicator shows it`s going up, so u should buy AUD, not to sell it.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
If GBP is shown to be weakening, and AUD to be strengthening then surely we'd want to short GBP/AUD? As in that would mean we're supporting the weakening of the GBP but strength of the AUD...

Tnavi, I'm struggling to see what this has to do with the strategy you've outlined on the first page. No trendline break, no sign of turning in the indicators. Or is it a new strategy, catching a falling knife perhaps?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
hi jack. the idea is the same; use the trendlines to run into 1 day charts. the method is simple, but we need a filter to make good entries. im trying to find some indicators to make better entries or discard the wrong entries.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I don't know what you mean tnavi, which trendlines are you referring to? Perhaps you could illustrate on a chart.

Mr Ma, love your charts. Do you go long or short when HG and UT in line with each other or do you also add candle reading into your trading? Beautiful trades....

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hello tnavi, how are you trading these days? Did you manage to find filter that you looking for? Enjoy your holidays...

--- 帖子 #538 ---
hi forexday, how i said before, i have time to trade with my other scalping (5 min ) method. im trying to filter the entries into 1 day chart with only 2 emas (34 and 144) and nihilist holy grail indicator. but, im playing only. i need a lot of time to make a good test. thanks!

Take a look at TDI on eelfranz's thread. Maybe this is what we need but on a day chart. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=291622

--- 帖子 #544 ---
If you're looking for filters you could try the 200 EMA. I've been using it to filter these trades pretty nicely. Price above I only take longs, price below only shorts. Honestly, tnavi, this method is simple an effective on the 4 hr charts also where I've been trying it with small lots. Thanks for sharing and helping others to understand.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Mikeh, The issue with 200 EMA is that it is a lagging indicator, besides, in a 1D TF it may take months or years to cross over. So, what do you do to make faster decisions, or add entries, without having to wait so much time? Can you give us your input, and some screens if possible? You mean you are only trading 4H? Best regards

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thanks forexday, I trade in line with the colors! Red color means sell and green means buy... Also I use the basic strategy tnavy presented us here in the thread. just combine it and we all make some money BTW I closed my two trades for a profit of 430 Pips together

Iam with you on this one!! Entered now on the 3rd bullish bar on the UT. Think it will go up today and then we get the confirmation from the HG indicator.

Hello Dansmol, Just wondering how are you doing with your 10 days trading live your approach? Any feedback will be verymuch appreciated. How do you exactly enter your trades? Do you go any smaller TF to get enter after a retrace? How bad is drawdown so far? Best

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Yes, I trade 4 hr charts only. What are you talking about takes years to cross? I don't trade a cross. I trade tnavi's original system posted on page 1 only I take long trades if price is trending above the 200EMA. Opposite for shorts. it's quite effective. Nothing is lagging about it.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
hi mike, what is your setting on 200EMA? for close?

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Ok, I get what you're saying. Now, you also use heiken ashi? And the nihilist? Any consideration when 200 EMA is flatten out, or slope opposite to the direction you "should" trade? Have you guys heard and tried the stochs RSI indicator? Seems so powerful, but haven't found one for MT4. I saw that indicator in a trading course, but they were using other platform.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi Obviously the current bar will repaint as the price changes but does Ultratrend repaint further back than than just the current bar? Thanks

--- 帖子 #568 ---
good post you got ,please how do i get the indicator showing comfirmation colors

--- 帖子 #569 ---
For me, I waited for the Holy Grail indicator to give me the confirmation with an additional buy signal. But this didn't happen. At the moment I keep an eye on USD/CAD... getting tight in a triangle, so there must be a signal soon Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Will you trade any of the 2 breakouts? Or actually you'll wait for a nihilist indication after the breakout?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
If there is a long breakout I will take it straight away, because it is in line with the "bigger trend". If it goes short, I will take it as well, I think. But in this case we have to keep in mind that it might be a "scalp" on the daily timeframe.

The breakout has occurred down and Nihilist gives the red signal so you may enter short by the beginning of the week, i think some pullback will happen then falling down again, what do you think ?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Iam absolutely with you! The breakout happened with some solid volume, so we should see a small retrace back to the trendline with some lower volume and the a strong push mit high volume down. The we might have a trend change. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hey! USDCAD Daily, 4H, 1H I think that is a realy perfect Short. Break out from the last "trend box". Re-touch the last resistance area. Inside pin bar after the bullish re-touch bar. Breaked my trend bar. ..... But now weekend and the monday coming. Should i trade this? Or wait until monday afternoon. ( cos of weekend and monday news) Million pips for the next week ( nov 22. ) You guys think, the price will retouch around 1.3000 the trend line, but i think have a strong resistance zone around 1.2500 and this is retouched i will short also but my SL 1.2560 Sell 1.2290 What you think?

is it general consensus the ultra trend indicator is not effective anymore to identify trade opportunities? I thought we said in the beginning it is very rare to see ultra trend repaint? we even had the chart from march 2014 to prove it. so that's why now everyone is moving to holy grail indicator? because the market has figured out everyone was using ultra trend. that's what happens when u share trading secrets in public forums. hee hee sigh.. if only trading were easy

for repaint issue perhaps it is better to wait half a day later rather than jump into the trade right away at 0:00. to give time for market to readjust and repaint if necessary. am I right to say this? that should provide more accurate results.

We cannot rely on any indicator alone, be it UT or HG.

In your chart we notice you change the default holy grail colors blue and orange to light green and magenta. Do you trade on these colors as well? Or do you only trade lime and red?

the market always changing. If you check a daily candel in 2008 was 500 pips, and now? 100. But if you check the market around 2014 jan-maj market was much faster then now.

Let's try something more dangerous with Gold i still trust this strategy

I believe u have found a good simple method, but made a wrong turn down the road as you started to scramble for a "filter indicator". As you couldn't tolerate stoploss. The magic isn't finding the perfect entry. Its a combination of trade management, money management, and most importantly, psych. Like flying a jet takes more than the fastest fighter jet in the world, but also 10k hours+ of fly time, pilot physical and mental fitness. Yall trying to find that perfect fast jet, but not a lot of people would actually spend time to train themselves into the professional mindset, and management skills. btw, it takes years of effort to train a doctor or a jet pilot. People here expect to make consistent money right off the bat. Make a few clicks on the mouse and wahlah they think they are "traders". Everybody can climb a hill, like everybody can get lucky here and there to make some money in Forex, but only the very determined few are able to climb up mount Everest, and only the very determined and smart few are able to rack in fat cash consistently from Forex.

This thread hasn't had some action since Dec 2014 - can any one confirm if this strategy is still viable in the market and if it still works? I used this last year and got some mixed results. Had some good profits and some losses but it was mostly due to my entry level which needs perfecting. If it still works is there an updated version of this indicator? Thanks in advance.

hi! this method works fine, of works. do u know why? because it can be used without indis. only trendlines and tons of patience. i left this method because i jumped into 15 mins chart (with very good results xDD). i have another thread opened. this thread can be used how inspiration for the people. green pips to all!

Hi Navi ! Good to hear from you again mate ! Haven't seen much action in this thread so I am just checking if this still works. Yes I do really like this strategy and looking to use it again as I took a break for a year from trading and now looking to get back into it. Can you post the link to the other thread you have open if you dont mind? 15min sounds good as that is the timeframe I am looking and is better for me. If you have a method that is similar but on smaller timeframes that would be perfect as I am mostly just scalping. Cheers

copyright violation coder asks that his code not be posted

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Can you please give the website that gives the rules / laws about COPYRIGHT? Surely you have something to support this request other than inconsiderate yelling at people Thank You

Guy is awfully concerned about someone else's rights How did this TRO guy "Copyright" his changes to another indicator in 2009 , when that indicator was adapted in 2014 ? And how did he access the code when only the .exe file is posted? Something very strange going on here? Does "Copyright" prevent the sharing of a file for personal use? Sure, I can understand if someone is selling it for gain but seems sharing for FREE is okay And is "Copyright" something you get an actual certificate for or you just write that in there to scare people? What if I just change it and Copyright it for myself? Surely, if it was worth anything, it would be locked and not able to open with MetaEditor? Does anyone know anything on this issue? I am currently searching, mainly on the MQL website. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Too Slow is a complete wanker and the more I look into him the more I'm convinced he is actually TRO (The Rumpled One). If you check this site out (kreslik.com) TRO is a prolific poster.....just another forex BS artist.Too Slow is a prolific poster of unintelligible charts on his own threads here on the FF

Source code was posted. Based on the fact you copied the copyright from the source code, Erebus. My concern is that the coder will stop sharing his code. Some traders respect and appreciate those who are nice enough share. One person making a claim about my charts doesn't make the claim a fact. The claim is only an opinion. We all know opinions are like @$$hole$. Some are bigger than others, Edge540 being a case in point.
