I am posting a screen shot of the wick length of the Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed indicator. The reason I am asking these questions is I think this indicator is about as close to the "holy grail" as I think I will find! It is truly an amazing method to rid the whip saws and keep you in a trending trade. If not for finding this indictor I was ready to throw in the towel. I thank the developer of this smoothed indicator and the author of this thread! Now for my questions. 1. Obviously a bigger candle body a bigger move but what does the upper wick tell us about the trend strength? 2. Why are there so many upper wicks compared to almost non-existent lower ones? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!!!!! Steinitz Attached Images http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1172579069

Wow. How do we get our hands on this indicator? Thanks

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I will attach the indictor and a screen shot so that maybe somebody can answer my questions on this amazing indictor. I just want to emphasize this is the holy grail for me. I understand how to interpret it and I look at 3 timeframes to see the entire picture. I look at at 1m 5m 15m or 15m 30m 1h or 30m 1h 4h or 1h 4h 1d you get the idea. It's a lagging indicator by way of all the averaging the indicator performs. It averages the candle open, closes, highs &amp; lows. It really keeps you in the trade and allows you to even pick a near beginning and near end of trend. I love this indictor and my search over the past 8 years is OVER !!!!!!!!!!!! Steinitz

Set the indicator with 2-6-3-2. This came from another author and I totally agree with his settings. Study the candles how they start to form (tall wicks and small bodies) in the beginning of a trend. See how the wicks shorten and bodies enlarge in the middle of a strong trend. See how the wicks get longer and bodies shorten at the end of the trend. Steinitz

I have included just an example of todays movement in the EUR/$. I am showing you the 15m, 30m &amp; 1h. Notice the beginning down trend on the 15 minute and confirmed start of larger 30 minute down trend and the end of the up trend on the 1 hour denoted by the shorter candle body and higher wick (1hr). God I love this country!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Basically it's just trading the cross of the 6 period triangular moving average. Unlike the real Heiken Ashi, I don't think the length of the wicks means anything with this indicator. Try putting a 6 period, .3 T3 on the chart with it . I think you'll see that it accomplishes the same thing.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Heiken Ashi Candles are very much like a moving average in that you get the big picture how the currency pair is trending. Looking at a chart of Heiken Ashi Candles can help you ride out the retracements and stay with the trend. I plotted the setting of 2-6-3-2 as suggested over the various EMAs that I typically use and found it is almost identical to the 13 EMA (median) which I have found to be one of the most helpful EMAs.

Its the exact same as a smooth 8 period ma

Here's another to look over~

Thank you for your efforts. If this works for you then dont look at any other indicators and dont take any notice of other people........ as a set up or system may suit one person and not the other. What strikes me is the closing price line plot with the bars. It gives a nice commanding view of the big picture. To handle the lagging nature, you use finer time frames. Great! If you plot also the straight line trend lines in candle mode and then switch back to line plot, you have a nice simplified "model". best j australia

is this the entry??

--- 帖子 #12 ---
It's amazing indicator.. thanks... Can anyone make EA for this indicator?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I'd say more like "squint over".

--- 帖子 #14 ---
The cable/yen pair tanked over 500 PIPS in (18 ) 4 hour bars or 72 hours. If anybody out there has anything negative to say about this indicator then I dare you to show me ANYTHING else that beats this. I was going to take this information without posting any further and start trading seriously but wanted to give back to the very people that gave me this. If you need a change in attitude go rent "The Secret". It will change your life and has been known for over 2000 years. Everyone from Einstein to Churchill new "The Secret". I feel my belief in the SECRET brought me here to this forum and now you will know the secret too. Steinitz

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I forgot to mention. I did not change the red arrow in all three timeframes; 30M, 1H and 4H. Also, this indictor does not re-paint.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Dude! I am on cloud 9. I don't even need to take a loratab today for the buzz. I have read that article already and the author also has issues with the wick heights. It's funny how the Chinese invented candlesticks which I feel are excellent and now I am following some more chinese indicators that translate into "Average candle" hence Heiken Ashi. We all know the Asians are from outer space and are here to teach us something new!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
May i know how to take trade? If M15,M30, and H1 signal Long so we Long? and vice versa? And how about stop lost and take profit? Thanks for the answer...

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Basically you take the shortest TF and when you see a change in color from red to blue go long. However, not so fast buddy boy. You must look at the next TF that is double the previous i.e 15M to enter so you look at the 30M. If the 30M is not ALSO blue don't enter. A tpical trade would be the following: 15 minute is trending up and you see 1-5 blue bars. So the 15M has been moving up for a short while causing the 30 minute to just start creating it's 1st blue bar. Now go long. You can exit when the 30 minute just starts to hint of a red bar. If you want a longer trade you can stay in until you see the 1 hour just turn from red to it's 1st blue bar. Now you exit on the 1 hour when you had enough fun or the blue bar on the longest TF being the 1h in this example just hints of a change in direction. That would be a small body with higher wick:body ratio and the start of a color change. I hope this makes sense. Look at my charts !!!!!!! Study study study

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi steinitz, Do you use any other indicator to filter the Heiken Ashi?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
No I don't. You don't need to. Forget about Bollinger bands, RSI, etc . I have tried all those indictors and the number one reason for failure in my honest opinion is WHIPSAWS and fear! This indictor is remarkable in giving a simple color picture of change in supply and demand and most importantly keeps you in the move WITHOUT getting shaken out from the constant NOISE of the market. By the way. It you see a nice trend in place and you want to enter in the process (I won't say middle) since we don't now the middle. Just make sure the candles are thick bodies in comparison to others and wick:body ratio is in favor of the body and enter when either the lower TF goes in the opposite direction OR the price moves close to the indicator. This will ensure you don't get in at the low of a down trend or at the high of an up trend. It just gets better!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Ok.. i'll learn deeper with this indicator.. Let's share together to improvement...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
How does this indicator differ from 12 ema? Thanks, Jim

--- 帖子 #23 ---
It appears as though this indicator will have a lot of the same problems as others during tighter ranging markets. How do you handle these market times? In your opinion is it okay to lose say... 120-150 pips on 3,4,5 consecutive losses to grab that big 200-250 trend? I suppose my question is, what do you expect out of Ashi during flat markets? Also, how would you handle the trades highlighted in the first image? BAD ASHI http://i136.photobucket.com/albums/q...kkjay/ASHI.gif ***** FORGET THE LAST VERTICAL BAR, MY MISTAKE. GOOD ASHI http://i136.photobucket.com/albums/q...kjay/ASHI2.gif Don't take it as negative, you should see me pick at other systems. I like to be constructive and offering images and questions will best serve to get answers.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I have come to believe that there are many indicators out there and all of them work to some extend and do not work to some extent. Virtually any indicator I think will work ever so much better if it is used on several different time frames at the same time and an entry does not take place until and unless all 2 or 3 time frames agree. That may actually be what makes this system so successful, not the indicator itself but the fact that it is designed to be used on several time frames at once. Good luck with your system and never stop using multiple time frames, you may find that that is your Holy Grail, not the indicator.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
On your 1st post I can't see the chart up close enough but if you get a reversing color on the TF that you are hoping to stay with (typically the longer one) before you exit look at one more TF longer to see if it tells you to stay in. 1-3 TF 's are very important to the success of this strategy. Sometimes you will stay in the trade too long (hind sight 20/20) and loose back all your profit without warning. That is just part of the game. I really don't want to get too involved with exits since there are so many ways to protect ones capital in any trade going the right direction. You might take a pre determined PIP goal. If you do you better test to see what R/R is needed to be profitable. P.S. Right now the EURO/$$ is making a nice little 15m to 1hr short.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I agree. Multiple timeframes is a must for any strategy. At least 2 TF's and maybe 3 for better entry and success.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I do believe that is the correct answer. I believe the original post by stating 15, 30 and 60 minutes should be used together is a key point. Also, it is true that an indicator will not always win. I think many struggle because they look for one that will and then give up on it when it hits them in the gut several times in a row. I like ASHI, with 15,30 and 60 mins I will take a look when I get a free moment.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Jim I don't know anything about the 12 EMA. If you want a deeper analysis of this method you can look up an earlier post with the link. The program is actually a little complicated and that comes from my observation only. I have programmed in other languages but not familiar with Metatrader.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
very similar with HAMA PAD.but yours chat is much more clean.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thank you. FYI the EURO fell about 6-7 PIP since my last post. I'm going to bed. I'll talk to you guys later and if you have any questions I will look them over tomorrow. Good trading and remember the "Secret"......

--- 帖子 #31 ---
HOLY GRAIL... come on dude you haven't even tested this thing yet. Anyways I'll go easy on the bashing and contribute instead. This an old set up I used to play around with - it incorporates what you guys are trying to do as far as entries based on multi time frames. This just makes it possible on one screen. Attached template (5M) and image, but it should be self explanatory. Enjoy, MM

--- 帖子 #32 ---
mr marketz, did you have any good results with this strategy?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I seem to have forgotten the secrect. Could you please remind me of it.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Somehow I knew someone was going to ask that... This will probably sound a bit "out there" but here it goes, "good results do not depend on strategy". They depend on something else - something every trader needs to discover on their own. Two traders will attempt this method and within one week, one would have gained 15%, and the other would have lost 35%. I don't like to discuss this much, because I usually get hostility in the responses. Those who need to understand this concept the most, aren't tuned in to this mode of thinking as of yet. The ones who do understand this, already know it. So it's almost pointless to talk about. Try it out for a few days, and let me know if it works for you. HINT: Set up on all pairs try to enter the trades right of the MA with stops below the lowest penetrated peak. Good luck, MM

--- 帖子 #35 ---
The "SECRET" = The "Law of Attraction"... you are what you think/dwell upon... so goes the book/DVD... certainly a worthy read imo. On using HA candles? I will on occasion for whatever reason, but i will always have a duplicate chart w/regular candles next to it! : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #36 ---
thx for the tips mr marketz, maybe i will but for the moment i m busy testing another sistem. Good luck!

Attached template (5M) and image, but it should be self explanatory. Apologies for sounding a little dumb, but new to the Forex! I have read the forums and I would like to try and trade with the Heishan-Ashi. I have joined MetaTrader and have an account with the MIG platform. I have downloaded the links Heishan_Ashi_smoothed.EX4 and tried to view it to no avail.......CAN anybody help???

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Very important question: Doesn't this Heishan Ashi indicator repaint?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Geordieboy, You have to place all indicators in a specific directory: Program Files/Metatrader/experts/indicators Make sure you close down metatrader &amp; then load it back up. It will appear under the 'Custom Indicators' area. And the only 'dumb' question is the one that is unasked Take care, D.

Here are some useful tutorials http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=8984

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Steinitz, Thanks for your input, and explanation. A couple of questions if I may. 1) You refer to three timeframes, but largely for entry you reference two and use the third and longest timeframe for 'possible' exits. Have I understood that correctly ? 2) What StopLoss do you generally set, presumably this will depend on what timeframe you are trading off ? I like some of the mehodology you have talked about, particularly the multiple TF's, and I agree with others in this thread, its probably the multiple TF that is giving you the edge. Good luck to you.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
No Miguel. Once the time frame on the candle is complete that's how it stays. It may change back and forth on the current candle, but once it's done - it remains.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Very helpfull thank so much!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Oh Boy, you guys'n'gals are GOOD! Many Thanks to you all here on this thread for setting me up on the Metatrader with the Heiken Ashi. I really appreciate it. Go get them Pips y'all!! Cheers

--- 帖子 #45 ---
1.Yes you have. Always exit on the longer TF. You can sometimes exit on a 3rd longer TF as long as the longest TF HAS/IS trending the desired direction. Two TF's are the usual.... 2. I don't use a stop since I am using the color and body of candles for my exit. If you need to walk away place a protective stop of your choice. Examples would include but not limited to B/E, Above or below candle upon entry or arbitary.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I'd like to discuss it, really. I understand what you're saying -- I've learned several good systems, none have made me a TRADER. I still take one step forward, two back. If you don't want to post it and iinvite hostility, pm me please, I'd like to hear what you have to say. I think I'm on the brink of the same conclusion, maybe you can save me some learning time and some grey hairs.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Blue, If you get a chance, read the thread started by Down River Trader. Not necessarily his method of placing trades but the philosophy. I don't want to distract people from this thread as it deals with method and not ideology. If you have any specific questions by all means feel free to shoot me a message. MM

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Here is an example of a 3 TF trade that wasn't as easy to see from the beginning in terms of confirmation on all 3 TF's at once. But make no mistake it is a vailid 2 TF entry and you can exit on the 2nd TF when you see a hint of trend change (no change noticed on this example) or wait and see if the next lomger TF begins to show a new color for a yet longer move. It's like the movie "The Blob". It just gets bigger and bigger....

try this...i found this system somewhere..the best combination of ashi smooth system..lots2 of pips... http://www.forex-tsd.com/manual-trad...entogg-78.html

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I am posting this next example to show you when things go wrong. This is what will happen the majority of times and how to handle them. This indicator will keep you in the trade which is the most impressive aspect of this method/indicator. Look at 1.bmp. You enter on AUD/USD on a 30 min. Like I said before typical entry will be 1-5 PIPS go by to confirm the trade/trend. You enter after looking at image 3.bmp which is the 1hr which shows confirmation as well. Now go to image 2.bmp. You are seeing points in the trade that would normally signal to close the short but WAIT. Look at the 1hr chart image 3.bmp. It says to stay in. So you do. Now look at the 1hr chart 4.bmp and later you find again some signals to exit this trade. But WAIT. Look at the 4hr chart 5.bmp before you decide to exit. Low and behold it says to stay in since the longer TF is in tact and doing fine. This explanation tells a BIG story on how you trade this indictor. Yes you will have easy trades with no bumps. But when you have this common theme occur you will know how to handle them under the pressure of trading. Steinitz

steinitz I have been using this system since last year trading live [only demo'ed for less than a month], and it has worked for me. Its my primary trading system for trending and ranging markets.... I know there are many skeptics, but what works for one may not work for another - just like many other systems posted here and elsewhere.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks I'll take a look.....

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I have a question about the entries. You state that you see 1to 5 blue 15 min. candles, you switch to 30 min tf and wait to see hint of color change from red to blue...Do you enter before this 30 min bar closes? What happens if the 30 min bar starts changing back to red after it you have entered when you saw it changing to blue? i was interested in using this entry method on shorter time frames and possible pivot point support/resistance...maybe 5/15/30? What is your opinion on this? Thanks for this thread

--- 帖子 #56 ---
You enter on the CLOSE of the 30M candle. This way you are dedicated to watching a new TF and will exit on that 30M if you see an immediate change in candle formations wick:body ratio or hint of color change or both. Any TF works. 1M 5M 15M no problem. 1D 1W 1M is fine too! If the 30M goes gainst you and the 1Hr gives you no reason to stay you are out with most likley a loss on that quick entry and exit.

So after you would enter on the close of the 30 min candle, if the next 30 min candle went against you, do you wait until that candle closes before exiting?(assuming that the 1 hr candle is not in agreement with your initial entry)

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Attached is the image from last night when I posted this prediction. No big deal just a winning trade. Ther was a moment that

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Yes. I have done all my back &amp; fwd testing on close of candles. Of course nothing is in stone here. If you wish to add some finesse to entries and exits by all means there is some room for art and science. If you want a mechanical approach just wait for closes and close your eyes and pull the triggers.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Attached is the image from last night when I posted this prediction. No big deal just a winning trade. There was a moment that the trade had a pause indicated by the blue bar and no other longer TF to indicate staying in. But if you study the system long enough even these tough calls will be handled easier with practice. Notice the short candle body and wick:body ratio in favor of wick. This is not a strong indication of a trend reversal. [/quote]

--- 帖子 #62 ---
[/quote] So what do you consider a strong indication of a trend reversal? Personally, I would have thought that s short body and large wick would have been an indication of trend reversal.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
[/quote] huhhh... hello steinitz.. interesting ....but still blur with u holy grail .. can u detail explain for me ... i play for longer time ... so can u explain with 4hour 1 day 1 week ..it can ?? or must 1 day 1 week 1 month .. hope u can detail explain

--- 帖子 #64 ---
No its not. This indicator is confusing once you are used to traditional Japanese candlestick charting. The high wicks are indications of reversals if the body is short as well. wick:body ratio in favor of wick length = less volatility. So what do you consider a strong indication of a trend reversal? Personally, I would have thought that s short body and large wick would have been an indication of trend reversal.[/quote]

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I don't undertand your question? You can use any time frame and any currency pair. Just make sure the TF's are at least double from each other i.e. 30, 1h, 2h or 1m, 5m, 15M or 5m, 10m, 20M or tick, 1m, 5m or 4h, 1d, 1w....etc huhhh... hello steinitz.. interesting ....but still blur with u holy grail .. can u detail explain for me ... i play for longer time ... so can u explain with 4hour 1 day 1 week ..it can ?? or must 1 day 1 week 1 month .. hope u can detail explain[/quote]

Hi does anyone have or know where to locate this exact same indicator for Tradestation 8.2? Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I definitely undertsand the entry mechanism and timeframe aspect of this strategy. I have a question though, mainly concerning the exit. I will use the 15min/30min/1H TF example. Once the 15min chart signals an entry, I will look for the 30min chart for confirmation. If confirmation appears on 30min, I will enter at the close of the 30min. Now the exit seems to be generally defined on the 1H TF. Once the HA signals a reversal in color, then exit the trade. Here is my question. Generally in order for the 1H chart to signal an exit, it would be quite common for the HA on the 15m and 30m TF's to have signalled a valid entry in the opposite direction. So. Do you ignore the valid reversal entry from the two lower TF's, or do wait for confirmation of the exit on the 1H, thus missing out on the valid reversal entry (probably too late). Thanks for your time.

i first use Heikin candle from Erol B from .tradecurrency. CA &lt;&lt;&lt; websites you have to purchase that .. been using it for months now ... and discoverd forexfactory .. if knew better .... i should never bought that, when i could get a similar system at FF websites .. anyways ... i use heikin ashi with phil nel 4h macd system, and all i'm looking for is a 0 line crossing on MACD... which i could just make an entry base Heikin ashi candle, but i'll wait for 2nd comformation ... and ride along the trade ... with about 30 sl .. and 20 trailing stop hope this a good info, for i am new to forex ...

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Please can you tell me how these indicators work to show different timeframes? Is it the indictor in the window at the bottom? Sorry to be stupid.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Yes go to the TradeStation Forum and do a search for Heiken Ashi. I think it may also be called TTM Trend as thats what TradeTheMarkets.com calls their version which I think they copied from TSW. I have it myself. But for the most part don't see much use for it as far as my style of trading goes. Don't think we are allowed to post ELD's here or I would? Good luck.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Its similar but there is also a Heiken Ashi indicator on TradeStation forums. Have been for years.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
The neat thing about the Modified Hull's Moving Average ( post 73) is that you can adjust the period setting and plot three time frames on one chart. I plot the following on the 4 hour chart ( I trade the Daily Fozzy, but want to get a better entry on the 4 H Chart). Period 8 (default setting) Period 48 (8x6 periods in Day) Period 240 (48x5 periods in Week) You have the trend of the 4H Day Week on one chart (4 H). The Bible makes reference to the power when two or three are in agreement. This is certainly true when it comes to trends in trading. The change of color corresponding to slope (trend) change makes it real easy to see in a glance if the three trends are in agreement. If so, you have a higher probability trade and one that has the potential for more pips. This can be used for all time frames, although, you will have to adjust the period settings. As JokerWild pointed out, it is similar to HA Candles. It has the added advantage of plotting three TFs on one chart which is great if you are scanning many pairs.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Is there an EA for this system to test? Thanks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Excellent question! I have looked at the same thing you mention here and found a solution with better exit. Like you said enter on your 15m and confirm with the 30M. Now here is where I found a better entry. Don't worry I will address the exit soon. The 3rd longest TF does not have to give a same trend color as the 2nd longest TF. In fact, for a better trade lasting longer look for the 3rd longest TF NOT showing the same color of desired trend but and opposite color. More importantly and needed at the same time is the candle stick or line graph of price needs to be moving up or down (depending on the initial direction of desired entry) close to and touching if possible the Heiken-Ashi candle. Here is the reason: You will find that this is considered an early move since the longest TF, in this example the 1h has not quite changed colors but hinging in the desired direction which in time will cause the Heiken-Ashi candle to finally change color of the desired trade and you will find a perfect set-up. Had you traded with the longest TF showing the same color as the initial trade you would have already been in the beginning or middle of that trend. Now for the exit. If you wait for the 3rd longest TF to show an opposite color you waited too long and lost too much profit! So here is the answer. What ever TF you are looking at, if the Heiken_Ashi candle is turning the wrong color flip to the next longest TF and if that TF is looking strong STAY IN! If not strong EXIT. You might find that you started with a 15M, 30M and 1H and actually ride a long trend and exit on the 1D TF. You will love that trade!!!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Yes it does look similiar and has the alerts. I like the change in candle bodies with the H-A-S however. Thanks anyway!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Thanks JokerWild for turning me on to the HMA Modified. I had been plotting my own MAs for the 4H Day and Week, but the Hull is much better! Watching the 3 Hull MAs interact is giving me the big trend picture plus the slope change coincides almost exactly with the Fozzy crossover. I'm thinking about putting my indicators on the shelf for a while and trading just the momentum of the market using HMA on multiple time frames. How do you use the stop losses and take profits that are on the indicator? I'm new to using TA, but have used 4XMadeEasy for some time. Thanks Steinitz for starting this great thread. Although I'm using MAs instead HAs, we're basically doing the same thing. Plotting the 3 TFs on one chart to me is a plus.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi All, First, thanks so much for this post - I definitely would love to implement it in my trading! I am new to this forum so I am not sure how Tradestation users are viewed I am a developer so I have no problems coding this indicator in TS 8,2 (and can share it once I'm done), but I was hoping someone could give me the formula breakdown - completely new to this indicator. I have looked at the ones on the TS forums but the don't quite look the same as yours, and based on what I see, I would much prefer to do it exactly as you have it. Again, to start with, I just need the formula details - then I can review these posts and study to determine how to best read the indicator. Many thanks in advance!!! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Steinitz, Did you ever get answers to your original questions? Mind sharing? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Funny you should ask. But no I never received my original answers I am looking for. Any help would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Does naybody know if the HMA indicator repaints? Also, there is a setting for yellow yet I see no yellow applied to any charts? Last question. When the blue turns to red or visa versa the Hull MA shows a price equal to price value 3. Once past this bar forward, value 2 or value 3 is the only value showing. Can someone explain what this indicator is doing? Thanks

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Could I trouble you for the formula breakdown for this indicator (that is the smoothing part)?

Hi Stepwise I agree. The TTM trend is not Heiken Ashi, and the Heiken Ashi on TSW are different to this one, as there is an up, down and a warning colour. The HMA's on TSW or also different to the ones discussed here, i think.

Hi everyone, I have been setting this up and trying to test the smoothed HA out, but I just had a few questions. First of all, lets use the 15m, 30, 1h timeframes. So you start to see blue candles on the 15m chart and wait for the 30m chart to start forming its 1st blue candle. Wait for the candle to finish forming in the 30m TF and then enter as the price moves upwards from the HA candle. All this is done before the 1h candle has started to become blue. So now you are in and the 15m candles are starting to go red, so you wait till the 30m candles start to go red, and exit BEFORE the 1 hr candles become red because that way you will still have profit. Now that you have exited, HAS A PERFECT SHORT opportunity arisen? and do you enter a short position immediatley?...I say this because for you to have exited form your long position, you will have had all the same confirmations as you would have had if you were not in any position and waiting for the sell?? My second question, is how do you get those bands on the charts that touch all the wicks of the HA smoothed candles? Any help on either of these points would be greatly appreciated. THANKS VERY MUCH!

Which one has the warning color? Not the one that I know of on TradeStation. Also the one on TradeStation is different but not dramatically so. In anycase Stepwise is looking for the FORMULA or indicator properties.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Yes you have the set-up correct. I feel there are many approaches that will work with this indicator but the one that I described is just something I am working with. The answer is yes. You can make this trade a SAR (stop and reverse). Just as long as there are confirming signals on the three time frames. I just want to throw out some other thought here. Lets say you look at a 15M TF and it starts to go blue. So you look at the 30M and it just paints its first blue candle. So you go long. You might ask why did I even look at the 15M TF and just look at the 30M for the start of a beginning blue candle? Well the reason is since this is a lagging indicator you can really get in early on the FIRST blue candle on the 30M. It's like a running start which might yield some extra PIPS. Now let's say you want more risk and want more early PIPS. Well you can enter on any TF say the 15M and start trading aslong as the 30M PRICE itself is pointing up (long position). The reason is if you are correct the 30M will eventually change color and you were in prematurely in the anticipation of that first color change. If it doesn't change you entered too early and you must exit when the SHORTER TF fails. Today I will look to see if this indicator REPAINTS. If it does I will be disappointed and need to look at the ramifications of my back testing. If it does repaint I believe it will still serve a purpose for good trading but I will need more time with it.

thanks for the reply steniz...some interesting points raised there. Just talkingmore about the stop and reverses, if you got confirmations, then technically, you would never be out of the market, you would either be short or long. .... i mean this is if you had enough time to be at your computer all day and just keep reversing the trades when you got more confirmation signals. One quick question about that though, when the market is going sideways, there may be times when the 15m candles start to turn blue and signal a long entry, so you look at the 30m which turn blue as well then you enter, but after 2 or 3 blue 30m candles, they start to go red again, so you would you exit at a loss or look at the 1h TF? there are lots of times from the charts where you only get 2 or 3 blue 30m candles and then 2 0r 3 red candles, and they chop and change colour a few times before you get any real trend going. So I think what I'm saying is how do you filter out these "noises" in the market?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
This is correct. I know the formula for the Heikin Ashi bars - I just want to know what the smoothing factor used is...anybody???

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi. Can you tell me how you use it in ranging markets please (tranding is obvious). Thanks.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Steinitz, I am new to this indicator and with the lack of formula information, I am learning by coding to match your images (don't have MetaTrader just TS). So, it looks like your two questions are very much related. I can answer question #2. Body = range between Open and Close Wick = range between High and Low From what I can tell (again, based on my own programming and no access to the actual formula used), the wicks are on top to give a clearer picture of the actual differences between body and wick. I achieved this same look in TS by determining the range of the Open and Close and showing that as the body from the low of the bar. I personally like this as it is a consistent / smooth view of what is happening. I believe you answered question #1 in previous posts. The larger the wick and the shorter / smaller the body the closer we are to a turn (change in trend)? I have programmed this using a basic smoothed average but I know it is not the actual smoothing function used. One start to this might be an explanation of what the parameters 2-6-3-2 pertain to. Any insight into this would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.

Hey JokersWild, Could you tell me what length you used for this HMA? Thanks.

I am extremely happy to report that this indicator does not repaint. I was looking back on charts this weekend using the 4H on various currencies. I would SAR the trade and always be in it. I was racking up some rediculous high profits and thought to myself this indictaor must be repainting itself lending to false historical data. Upon looking at some key reversal points I noticed that I was staying in at some rare times just before a huge reversal and thought this couldn't be right that next bar would have averaged in and shown a SAR candle. So I was feeling kinda sh-ty and thought here we go again another repainting indicator! So this afternoon I looked at 10 currencies on the 1M TF and drew red and blue lines LIVE to see if any repainting was going on. NONE ! That means I am doing the humpty dance of joy my friends. I have attached just 5 of my charts. No repainting on 1M is just as telling as 30M or any other TF.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I don't have programming experience but I can tell you if you Google this indictor you will get some extra information out there. I would say the majority is on this indicator without smoothing. I have been looking ta all different types of like indicators and I came up with: 1. HMA 2. HMA Modified 3. HMA 2 color 4.HMA_Russian_color People are out there looking at this as the basis for other developments. I just glanced over at Cable. Look atwhat just continued!!!!!

--- 帖子 #93 ---
The noise that can't be filted = loss. Accept it! Nothing is perfect. This is about as good as it gets. I have never seen anthing that touches the preciseness, lack of shaking you out of a trade, and the ability to stay in a trade 24 hours a day implimenting SAR approach.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Attached is market action today. I am showing you Cable/$$$ on a 1M, 5M and 15M. See the entry on the 1M. See how it confirms with the 5M (small red wick on a blue body). This is a great indication in change in direction by the way. See the price moving/pointing towards the 5M. You want to this this on any longer TF regardless. Let me say that again. You want to see the price moving/pointing towards the HAS candle. This action of course is what drives the candles to change color in the first place. Now look at the 15M It really wouldn't look like this on the 1M TF since this is AFTER THE FACT. But you can see the area I am showing you denoted by the arrow. Again the most important thing to notice on this longest TF is not the color of the HAS candle but the direction of price in relationship with the HAS candles. Today I booked 55 PIPS on Cable/$$ and 383 PIPS on Cable/Yen all within 2 hours of market open. "If I was a rich man dada deedie dada dedie deie dum?"

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hey Steinitz, Now I know I really need more info since I definitely don't know how a red candle shows up on a blue body. Also, I have been doing the research but the smoothing factor is just not the same as what is here...missing something. Do you know if those ex4 (Metatrader) indicator files expose the code that I would be able to look at? If someone knows how to open up the code view for this indicator in Metatrader and can post / send the text viewable code, I would be VERY grateful. This would be all I need. I am very eager to learn more about this indicator - but I have to actually have the right indicator to begin with. Thanks!

Ranging markets are a problem from any trend following system. One way to avoid getting stopped out when looking for new set-ups is to look at longer trends that are already in place. Take a currency for example on a 1H TF. Now it's been trading down for some time ( red candles ) now and the wick:body ratio is ok and not showing much change in momentum. Go ahead and get on the 30M TF and look for the candles to go blue. As soon as the candles are going blue (contra-trend) wait for the blue ones to start losing momentum (smaller candles etc) and get in short on the FIRST red candle. What you have done is re entered on a sold down trending move at the right time!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
If you are talking about the "bands" and I understand you correctly those are the "line charts" on my platform. I use them because thay make my HAS candles stick out better, visually and I like how the lines will POINT to the direction of trend.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I do want to stress one more time that there is not just one way to enter and exit this indicator. If somebody put a gun to my head and asked the best set-up I would reply "Take my G-D damn wallet". Sorry. Turrets syndrome. No really this is what I recommend: 1. Enter long or short on the lower TF. Again about 1-5 candles in the same color. 2. Look at the next longer TF. If the candles are going in the opposite color BUT the line chart is pointing and actually starting to penetrate the HAS candles that is good. 3. Third TF is not that important but if it shows signs of weakness i.e. wick:body ratio (Higher wicks and smaller bodies), HAS candles starting to hindge and price also hinging too you have an extra chance that your trend will continue longer. So what I want is the lower TF to march forward in the desired color, Then I want the next longer TF to just start to change color. If you wait for the 2nd longest TF to already show the same color you have waited longer for solid confirmation BUT gave up some extra PIPS. Thise extra PIPS are usually a lot since price has the strongest velocity when price reverses.

Here is a snap shot of what an early anticipated entry LQQKS like. Study please and you will see how this baby works.

As you are aware HA is an average. HA candles are not the same as price candles and the HA candles do not represent OHLC levels the same way as a normal price candle. The best way to look at HA is to pretend the that you are looking at a band of averages. For example in an up trend the blue HA candles represent the spread of the average...so in a strong trend if you had multiple moving averages (like 3,12) you would see them spread apart and moving upwards. As the trend diminishes or reverses, the average band narrows and then crosses. This is exactly what happens in HA; the candles get smaller and you start to see small wicks, double wicks or low wicks. In otherwords, you see more low wicks in HA during a non-trend (whipsaw) phase simply because the average is whipsawing around. In an up trend the HA is typically 75% below the Hi so you almost always see hi wicks. In the low trend the HA is typically 75% below the Hi so you almost always see the hi wick. The low wicks appear when the average is squeezing together, whipsawing or there is about to be a reversal. One good indication of a reversal or end of a trend is a double wick HA candle. They almost always preceed the end or signal the beginning of a trend. If you want to see this more clearly, simply add a rainbow of Moving Averages say from 3-12 and you will see the averages moving with the candles and you will see clearly how the HA average works and why there are so few low wicks. The HA is not the same as moving averages, as the HA averages are calculated differently. However, the MA's will give you insight into what the HA wicks and candles are doing and what they mean. I feel you get far more information from the HA Smoothed than from Moving Averages as the HA does not lag as far back as MA's do. If you learn to read the HA candles (which takes practice practice practice) you will gain powerful insight and make lotsa pips. I have one added indicator that helps...see next post.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
The Aroon indicator added to the HA Smoothed will give you early insight into what HA is going to do. Many people don't use the Aroon because they look at it and say "WTF"! Which was my reaction until someone taught me how to use it. This is how I learned to use the Aroon and use it every day with the HA Smoothed. It works very well. I actually use the Aroon Horn indicator which was adopted for MetaTrader, but there is no real difference between it and the normal Aroon. The Aroon has a red line and a blue line. The scale is 0-100 and represents a percentage. You want 3 level indicators on your Aroon, 70,50 and 30. A strong up trend is when the blue hits 100 and stays above 70 while the red is below 30. A strong down trend is when the red hits 100 and stays above 70 while the blue stays below 30. Your buy signal for Long is when the blue line hits/crosses the 50 level, coming up from 30. I use HA Smoothed to confirm entry, but sometimes I wait until the blue hits 100 if the HA is not lined up yet. Your exit signal for your Long is when the blue drops from 70 to 50...get out, expecially if the red is moving up from zero and is at 30 or 50. The sell signal works the same with the red line. The further apart the red and blue lines the stronger the trend. If the red and blue lines are together, you are usually in a flat pattern with whipsaws. I typically read the Aroon from the 1 Hr, but like HA I like to use at least 2 time frames to confirm...usually 30 min and 1 Hr. There is more to the Aroon than I can express in words that comes from experience in using it. Again, this is an indicator that takes some practice when used with HA, but is extremely powerful for entry and exit into trends once you get the hang of it. Just watch it over and over for a week and what it does with the HA Smoothed and you will see the how they work together.

Hi Spudfyre, Thanks for the detail on how you use the Aroon! Sounds interesting I'd like to try it with the HA....Could you please post a copy of the Aroon on this thread. Thanks &amp; Regards Cosmo II

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I'm loving this thread. Anyway, I have been looking at this system. It appears to me (unsurprisingly) that a lof of failed trades appear to be at times of either low volatility, or periods of poor 'volatility quality'. I wondered whether or not the attached indicator is a valid filter, using the same 3 period setup. I don't want to 'interefere' with what appears to be a good system to start with, but figured that some people would be interested in this.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thanks for that post spudfyre, really helped me out. How do we get the aaroon indicator ? ive got metatrader, but just not sure how to get aaroon indicator?! thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi Spudfyre, Great explanation...just a couple of follow up questions - since I am trying to recreate this specific smoothed HA indicator on a different platform. You said: For example in an up trend the blue HA candles represent the spread of the average...so in a strong trend if you had multiple moving averages (like 3,12) you would see them spread apart and moving upwards. The spread of the average means what? The spread between the averaged Open and Close vs. the averaged High and Low? Based on the code that was previously posted by Steinitz, I have been able (I think) to determine the formula. It seems that a smoothed average (6 periods) of the H,L,C,O is obtained. With those values the HA formulas are applied to get the HA values. Finally, an EMA (2 periods) is applied to those HA values to get the ones that are painted. What I don't understand yet, is how these values are painted (trying to figure out how Metatrader applies SetIndexStyle and SetIndexBuffer to paint bars). This is why I asked about the spread - I think this would give me more insight into how this thing is plotted / painted. Any help is always greatly appreciated!

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Here it is...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
What the spread means between averages is open to interpretation. One can say that with averages of any kind they always move to criss cross each other.....so the argument can be made that the further apart they get the more likely they are going to come back together. The argument can also be made that as they start to spread you can be in a stronger trend....until the averages move back together which usually means the trend is dead or the market is reversing. Typically why MA systems are difficult is the reversal is already made by the time the MA's cross each other from there lag. So the trick with getting good results with an MA system is looking for that spread and figuring out when the MA's are going to come back together...before they actually do. Put an MA 3 and an MA 12 on your chart. You will notice in an uptrend or down trend how these MA's split apart. For example in an uptrend the 3 MA is above the 12 MA. Similarily with the HA, the HA candles lengthen where an uptrend you will see longer blue candles. With HA the candle body is the actual average, so the candle body is your "average spread" between the highest average and the lowest average. The wick of the HA, is where the edge of the average started when the HA candle first opened. So, as the averages squeeze together you will see wicks.....because the way HA is calculated you will usually only see hi wicks, but occasionally when the average starts to squeeze tight you see double wicks (hi and lo). This is a simple explanation. As you are probably aware, MA's tend to wiggle closer together and farther apart during a trend and this is why most MA systems concentrate on crosses. In HA you see that "cross" when you see small candles or a candle body one colour and the wick a different colour. You also see the averages cross when you go from a HA blue candle to a HA red candle or vice versa.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thanks Spudfyre! I definitely get the concept of averages and spreads since I use spread histograms all the time (Stochastics). What I need to understand is the actual representation of those spreads for this particular indicator. Let's take this scenario: haOpen, haClose, haHigh, haLow I just need to know with these values (assuming all calculations and smoothing has been done to reach these values for a bar) how is the candle body and candle wick calculated. I.e. Wick = range between haLow and haHigh? Body = range between haOpen and haClose? I know there is more to this since I would not get a red wick on a blue candle with those simple calculations. Again, thanks for the info and help!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Interesting indicator. I was doing a little research on it and found that 7,3,7,7 seems to work very nicely on the 1H chart. It is almost too nice. Do you know if this indicator repaints?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
No it doesn't, to my knowledge, and if you set realtime to false, it only updates on Bar Close (which is my preference). Its a well filtered version of the Volatility Quality Index by Thomas Stridsman.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Ineterstingly, it signalled the potential end of the short on cable on all three timeframes simultaneuously a few moments ago (15,30,60).

--- 帖子 #115 ---
The original HA works off this formula: haClose = (Open + High + Low + Close) / 4 haOpen = (haOpen(previous bar) + haClose(previous bar))/2 haHigh = Maximum(High, haOpen) haLow = Minimum(Low, haOpen) This is my thought, whether it is right or not..... Working on a blue HA candlestick: When a new HA stick first opens...you have the bottom of the candle body which is the haOPen and the top of the candle body which is the opening price. The candlestick body is calculated at the close of the stick which is haOpen and haClose. The hi wick which is the whatever the hi price was above the calculated haClose. A lo wick is whatever the lo price was below the closing calculated HA candlestick body. The "average" spread is between the calculated HA candlestick body (haOpen to haClose). That's regular HA. I haven't dived into the math of the smoothed version.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Can you share what input settings you are using for the 15,30,60?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Just the default, although I beleive 5,3,1,2 has been popular !

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Right, so if I understand you correctly then the body is in fact the range between haOpen and haClose. Does this mean the High or haHigh above the haClose? Or does it mean whatever was higher between the High and haHigh? For a blue candle this would mean the Low or haLow below the haOpen? What I still don't understand is how a red wick would be determined on a blue candle. Really sorry for the bantering but I am obviously missing something..... Your patience is VERY much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Answers above. To help, start from observing the opening of each HA candle and then comparing what it does on the close of the candle (live). If you remember that the haClose and haOpen define the candle body and the wicks are hi's and lo's beyond this average you'll get the idea probably better than I am explaining it. I found it easier to digest HA by watching it live on the 5 min and to watch what was happening to the body and wicks as priced moved and then what the HA candle finished as. The other thing to work on understanding HA is using multiple MA's...I've used 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 with different colours. If you watch this ribbon and how it moves, squeezes, flips, and what HA is doing you can get a pretty good idea of what is hapening with HA. Just remember HA and Moving averages are calculated differently, but the movement of both is relatively the same. I don't use MA's to trade btw. However feel free to keep asking questions.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Follow up above. Thanks for your replies! The reason I am getting specific is because I am comparing to the actual code that generated this indicator (posted above in this thread) and I don't see any calculations that match this. [Again, I am coding this in TS so it is the specific calculations and logic for the way the bar is painted that matter to me]. If someone could look at the code below, and can explain to me how the painting logic works, I think that is the missing key for me. Specifically looking at just the points being painted: NOTE: I only included the painting logic - not the HA calculations - just trying to keep it simplified. Inserted Code //---- indicators IndicatorBuffers(8); SetIndexStyle(0,DRAW_HISTOGRAM, 0, 1, Red); SetIndexBuffer(0, ExtMapBuffer1); SetIndexStyle(1,DRAW_HISTOGRAM, 0, 1, RoyalBlue); SetIndexBuffer(1, ExtMapBuffer2); SetIndexStyle(2,DRAW_HISTOGRAM, 0, 3, Red); SetIndexBuffer(2, ExtMapBuffer3); SetIndexStyle(3,DRAW_HISTOGRAM, 0, 3, RoyalBlue); SetIndexBuffer(3, ExtMapBuffer4); //---- SetIndexDrawBegin(0,5); //---- indicator buffers mapping SetIndexBuffer(0,ExtMapBuffer1); SetIndexBuffer(1,ExtMapBuffer2); SetIndexBuffer(2,ExtMapBuffer3); SetIndexBuffer(3,ExtMapBuffer4); SetIndexBuffer(4,ExtMapBuffer5); SetIndexBuffer(5,ExtMapBuffer6); SetIndexBuffer(6,ExtMapBuffer7); SetIndexBuffer(7,ExtMapBuffer8); if (haOpen&lt;haClose) { ExtMapBuffer7[pos]=haLow; ExtMapBuffer8[pos]=haHigh; } else { ExtMapBuffer7[pos]=haHigh; ExtMapBuffer8[pos]=haLow; } ExtMapBuffer5[pos]=haOpen; ExtMapBuffer6[pos]=haClose; pos--; } int i; for(i=0; i&lt;Bars; i++) ExtMapBuffer1[i]=iMAOnArray(ExtMapBuffer7,Bars,MaPeriod2,0,MaMetod 2,i); for(i=0; i&lt;Bars; i++) ExtMapBuffer2[i]=iMAOnArray(ExtMapBuffer8,Bars,MaPeriod2,0,MaMetod 2,i); for(i=0; i&lt;Bars; i++) ExtMapBuffer3[i]=iMAOnArray(ExtMapBuffer5,Bars,MaPeriod2,0,MaMetod 2,i); for(i=0; i&lt;Bars; i++) ExtMapBuffer4[i]=iMAOnArray(ExtMapBuffer6,Bars,MaPeriod2,0,MaMetod 2,i); To me, this looks like it is painting single numbers - not a range - so I don't know how the candle is actually being drawn. I have come close in TS but it is not quite right - and I know my logic is flawed in drawing the bar. Any insight (or even pointing to documentation) would be much appreciated (but I don't have Metatrader - using TS). Thanks again!

Hi All, Just want to let you know that i'm currently working on developing an EA based on Steinitz's method. Please let me know on any special requests / recommandations you might have. The current EA design is (corrections are welcomed): Entry: a blue/red HA candle with a confirmation of a blue/red HA candle on the next bigger TF. Exit: An HA candle with the opposite color is being formed wth the confirmation of the same color in the HA candle in the next bigger TF. In case the next bigger TF candle is a "strong" (its size is bigger then 5 pips?) candle in our current trade direction - we stays in. So stay tuned for the upcoming beta !

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi All, HERE IT IS: The first version of the Heiken Ashi Smoothed EA works according to Steinitz guidlines. I'm posting it currently only as ex4 file just for the purpose of keeping an organized version control. Please backtest it on any currency and on any time frame, and post your impressions / suggestions / questions / bugs / etc.. Good Luck !

Thank you Spudfyre. Just when I thought less is better I come across this indicator. It really does what you claim on initial glance. I will definately look at this in depth which I love to do. This might just be what we need to exit earlier before the HA says to which usually results in loss of much profit. If it can do that it can get us in early like you said. I have to run out right now but want to re-read what you explained about the HAS indicator. I want to understand why red and blue candles have upper wicks almost exclusively. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Spudfyre....... I have noticed all different combination of what the Aaron Horn indicator will do. Sometimes the upper color decends before the lower ascends and visa versa too. What is this indicator performing? What do you consider more important the upper band movement or lower band movement? I know this might be an ambiguos question and I hope you understand what I am driving at? Thanks

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Look at my earlier posts showing my 10 currency tests on a 1m TF. NO REPAINTING. Can you believe it? Charts look to good to be true and indicator is not repainting.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Where are you seeing realtime parameter? I don't see that option in the setting in the H.A.S. indicator.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I appreciate your willingness to code an EA for this. I tried using it and didn't really see the proper entries and exits but honestly I am new to Metatrader especially EA's. In fact I just tinkered with it to see it run for the first time tonight. I hope you stick with this and spend some time on this thread. I believe together with the HAS and Aroon Horn we could make things happen. I have an extensive background dealing with inventions. I hold two patents in electronics. I am willing to assist you in refining this EA until we come up with a winner. I invite everyone to assist in coming up with ideas. I would love to have a black box even if I gave up some pips in not haveing the human element to fine tune the entry and exits. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I just wanted to let people here know that I have spent hours tonight looking at the Aroon Horn indicator. I see how it does have some benefit but for me I see just too much confusion. Most of the time on the lower TF this indicator gives false signals and gets you out just before a nice move. if you wait for a confirmation on a longer TF you again waited too long. I believe less is more and some chineese wise guy said "a man who wears one watch can tell time but a man that wears two watches doesn't know what time it is". Again it isn't bad in my opinion but I think I will pass on it. I like to focus on just the two colors and the size of the HA candles. I also see the line charts giving a better signal earlier then the Aroon Horn indicator. If you wait on the longer TF for the HA candles to show weakness (discussed in earlier posts) and price moving or penetrating into the HA candles (easily seen using line charts) this will give an earlier signal even before a color change on the longer TF. Ok just my 2 cents worth and if somebody disagrees I have zero problems with that. Looking forward to more discussion and possible EA's built and further refinements. "Opinions are like "a holes" everybody has one." I know this wasn't necessary but I couldn't resist. Thanks for all suggestions and indicators to help improve this method!!!!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hey bud! We are looking forward to additional testing and refinements from you. I know it will be fun and worth it. This indicator just makes money on all TF's and all currencies. I don't know if I will ever trade automatically but if you can show us a profit after we all help you program the EA I will consider it. I will need help to understand how to use this MT4 for auto trading and back testing. Regards!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
You can read this help file written by aparsi describing how to attach an EA to a chart: http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...3&amp;d=1166762817 And i'm sure a quick search in FF forums will give you explaination how to you use MT4 strategy runner for backtesting EAs.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I DONT think that this EA is ready for live trading yet. So everybody - be carefull and use it only in Demo and backtesting for now.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Attached is an example of how to enter on the early TF without getting a color bar on the longer TF before making your entry. This technique will get you in earlier and will make substantially more PIPS. There will be some extra risk in a possible premature entry without waiting for longer TF color bar change. With risk comes reward.....

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi! Steinitz how do you manage the stops?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I have an easy answer for that. It was mentioned before. What ever timeframe you are on, once the candles start to turn the opposite color you immediatly look at the next timeframe higher and if that TF is the correct color of the trend you are in you stay in. As soon as the current trend turns to an opposite color and the next higher TF doesn't support your original color you exit. There will be times that you are staying in from 1M to 4 hrs. Here is how this works. You go long on the 1M since it is blue let say 1-5 HAS candles. Now your 1M trend has turned red and you look at the 5M and it is still blue. Ok now you disregard ant TF less then 5M and as soon as the 5M turns red you look at the 15M. It is blue so you stay in. Your 15 minute goes up but then starts to turn red. You look at the 30M and it is blue etc etc. This really can happen and does. And sometimes you only get a very short ride and you exit with a small loss.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
thank you

--- 帖子 #137 ---
4xMaster and I will be discussing what makes up winning trade. I will need to give him entries and exits. I will need to be mechanical so he can program this. If anyone has suggestions tonight I will look at them before I post tomorrow for all to read. I am hitting the snow shed and will figure something out tomorrow. I would like to know if anyone can add an alert to this indicator looking at one or multiple timeframes? This would be a nice start!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Just a thought - how often do profits continue once the higher TF HA candles start to have small bodies? Is it an idea to exit part of the position once this happens and leave part in for the chance of extra pips? I would also like to stay how marvellous this indicator is. Despite attempts by me and others to find other indicators to add to this to help (or even support and resisitance), they all seem superfluous so far. Just goes to show maybe we all overcomplicate things at times.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi 4xMaster, thanks for your efforts. I have attached it to a 1 min chart (Cable), and opened a 5 min, and a 15 min, just purely to test for entries and exits. However no entries as yet, even though I think there have been some valid entries. Do I need to have it running in all three TF's or is just running it in the lowest TF sufficient for it to operate ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hey, You need to attach it only to the lowest TF. Do you see a smiley face at the upper right corner of the chart? If you don't - make sure that you checked the "allow live trading" checkbox within the EA properties window and enabled the "Expert Advisors" button.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi, Yep all that is fine. I have attached a screenshot for you. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I was playing with the VQ indicator and the HMA Modified indicator along with the HA_Smoothed on the 1 hour chart. While backtesting different settings on the VQ indicator I noticed something interesting. The VQ buy sell indicators almost always lined up when the HA indicator crossed the HMA modified. What is more interesting is that when HA crosses the HMA it is a great enter/exit signal. It is when the HA candle body crossing HMA. Here are my settings if you are interested in looking at this phenomena: TF 1 Hr (I find VQ not very good under 1 Hr) VQ Settings Timeframe 60 Length 7 Method 3 Smoothing 7 Filter 2 HMA Modified HMA Period 48 HA Smoothed 0,1,3,2 (default) Just thought I'd share it.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Interesting indeed. Since it works rather like the confirmation of a breakout, purely on price volatility you would expect the volatility to confirm the direction of the trend if one is underway. Where I think VQ is good is that it can confirm the intensity and 'quality' of the price movement.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I just ran the HA_Smoothed crossing the HMA on the 4 hour and it is really nice. Should probably mention I'm just testing it on EUR/USD for now.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Sorry 4xMaster, but I don't seem to be able to get the indicator going at all. I installed it into the C:\Program Files\MIG Trading Station\experts\indicators area but it won't load.......any ideas? Thanks for an excellent thread here

--- 帖子 #146 ---
ok, 2 questions... what would be an entry signal (just a change of colour, or maybe combined with a price cross?) and how can they be filtered (maybe something you use)?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi, This is not an indicator its an EA, which means it puts trades automatically according to some predfined rules. You need to put it in your experts directory (not experts/indicators) and then attach it to a chart. You can refer to post #143 on this thread for more details.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Liquidating part of your position is a personal choice. The great thing here is once you find a consistently profitable method/indicator money mgm't just becomes ones own personal preferance. Just experiment or backtest to see what's best for your risk style.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Be careful. The HMA repaints.......

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Does this repainting occur in MetaTrader because the code looks (or loops) back to do its calculations for each bar? As compared to TS that starts at the beginning of the chart (after necessary number of bars) and works its way forward? Just trying to understand as I am comparing Tradestation and Metatrader. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hey Jokers, How? Can you share this indicator? MTF_FXSniper'sCCI Thanks!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
hey joker, i cant seem to get the sniper to work, i put it under indicators, when i load it on the chart, nothing seems to come up?!

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Thanks Jokers. I saw most of your post and I would say that you are very helpful, you're a great source of information to this community. Many thanks to you and specially to steinitz for starting this wonderful thread.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Joker, the indicator is not working. Seems like it has dependencies with other indicators. I cannot tell which indicator it has dependencies because it is a compiled file.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Here are the rules for long entry: 1. lowest TF must be at least one blue HAS candle. 2. The next highest TF must be a (blue wick with a red body or a (blue candle) and/or price must be &gt;= HAS candle. [You need to look at the HA,val 2,3 or 4 and HLOC prices to figure what would be representive of this]. 3. Note: if we made price &gt; price [1] bar ago we would obtain a better angle. Here are the rules for long exit: 1. Current TF displays it's first opposite candle color AND next largest TF is an opposite color of initial trend Here are the rules for staying in trade when current HAS candle turns opposite color. 1. Go to next higher TF and if HAS bars are the same color stay in trade. Reverse everything above for a short entry and all rules that followed. This should be a good start.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I have attached two snap shots that would get you in and out fairly early with a small loss. As I pointed out in the description in the image you could alter my rules (could be discussed) and use the initial entry rules throught the whole trade.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I believe that there is enough risk inherent in 4x that survival is the biggest key. I know I have wavered and said you could get in early on the next highest TF if the candle doesn't confirm but price is penetrating HAS candle. I personally will adapt a very rigid mechanical style that a monkey could follow and in hopes would be a black box trading system. I am going to just look for colors to match and make this system "black &amp; white", whoops blue and red.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
To all thanks for this great thread. I have been testing the EA on 4 different pairs and it seems to be working well but if you could add the symbol() and period () to the alert it would be helpful to keep track of alerts from each pair. Also, I assume by changing the magic number in the setup this is allowing the EA to keep track of the separate trades. It would seem that you could get a better entry by looking at the price crossing the HA. Also, in the trades so far it would be a nice feature to add a trailer with the option to move to breakeven and lock. This would be very helpful on the longer TF trades. A scale out to free trade scenario would also be helpful to free up money for additional trades in other TF. If you need additional testing comments I would be happy to assist.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thanks Joker. I found the problem. It's looking for this indicator, "FX_Sniper's_Ergodic_CCI_Trigger" Please attach that indicator.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hahahaha... If somebody gets rich using this indicators then they will definitely look for you buddy. So, it will pay off later. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
how exactly does this indicator work, you wait for a blue bar to pop out ofd the red one and when the stoch lines cross then you jump into the market for a few pips?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi Steinitz &amp; everyone Just finished reading thru this thread &amp; I must say what a great method from Steinitz &amp; all that have contributed along the way. I have not looked @ this method, but will do so over the next several days. One question...are the indicators @ the beginning for Heiken Ashi the correct ones that are being used? Tks to all that respond. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Yes they are accurate. No revisions thus far in this thread. Thanks for the compliment. We need alerts! :

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Ive been looking at the has method and i have found that you can use the 4hr tF as a trend indicator and either buy only or sell only based on what your 15min and 30min Tf says. For examply, if you look on the 4h and you are in a downward trend, then i would only sell based on my 15 and 30min. If i saw a blue bar i would not buy. I would follow the trend. When the 4hr trend changes to a buy then it is safe to buy on 15min/30min.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Steinitz, When I load the indicator on my chart is it correct to be showing over the candles that are already in place? On your charts you posted it seems that we are only seeing the HeiKen Ashi. What is the correct way? Tks. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #166 ---
What you have pointed out is what I referred to back in one of my earlier postings. What you are seeing is a strong trend in the longer TF i.e. 4Hr. Now what you do is look at the 1M to 1hr (your choice) and wait for a series of blue candles to emerge. As soon as the last candle turns to red JUMP IN and take the ride! Based on the length of TF will determin how much PIPS you will squeeze out of the other guys pocket. Is there anybody on here that can program an alert on one or more TF's? Waiting to see how 4xMaster does with the EA. P.S. Look back on my answer to somebody asking about ranging markets and that is how I replied to him.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
thanks for that really helpful tip, it's posts like these that really help me out. WELL PLAYED

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Great question. On the smoothed version "HAS" make sure you set the inputs to 2-6-3-2 in that order.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I have one question to ask each and everyone on here? WHY DOES ANYONE WORK ?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Can anyone tell me if a daily candle once opened, lets say in a white color, will it repaint itself to red during the course of the same daily candle, or will it stay the color it opened with? Thanks

--- 帖子 #171 ---
The current candle "any TF" will always repaint. It has not finsihed the candle and the indicator is based of of "closing" prce.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I'll send my resignation letter as soon as you trade live.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I do trade live. I have putr in my dues and finally getting some of my earlier losses back. Between 4x and live poker (no limit) I make my living. The last 2 weeks I have traded 1 lot and netted 1373 pips or 13,730.00. That is after my comissions of an average of 1 PIP round trip.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi Everybody, I'm working on updating the EA to work exactly according to the above rules. Hope to post an updated versiion tommorow, so stay tuned.. Again if you have any other suggestions, please post them in the thread or PM me. Regards

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Steinitz Have the indicator loaded &amp; set to your setting that you advised &amp; the indicator look like an extension of the candlestick candles I am using. No wicks just the body of another candle. What do you advise? AceTrader

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Go to post #13 and save to experts indictor both attachments. Close down MT$ and re-open it. Drag and drop the indicator which should say Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed. Go to charts, indicator list. Click on indicator and hit edit. Common = Allow external....Inputs = 2,6,3,2. Colors = Red, blue, red, blue. Width = 1,1,3,3. Style = 0,0,0,0. Visualization = All timeframes &amp; show in the data window. End This should work

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Look at the image here. If you prematurely enter on the longer TF using price penetration (subjective) for confirmation and you are wrong you will get your clock cleaned. If you wait for the color candle confirmation you will be much safer and you can clean somebody elses clock.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi, One question: in bullets 1 and 2 - we are talking only about the bars' close price, right? nothing should be done before a bar is closed (beside drinking a beer or two.. ) ?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Another question: in bullet number 2 and 3 - the price you are talking about is the price at the higher TF ot the smallest TF ?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Listen that is funny and I know funny. Yes all issues concerning bar prices will be "on the close".

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi, Thanks for sharing your work with us and I really appreciated. My question is how do you have only 1 PIP round trip? Which broker allow to have only 1 PIP? TIA Andy L

--- 帖子 #183 ---
EFX Groups is a true non dealing desk broker. I can actually get in as tight as 1/10 of one PIP spread. They do charge a commission based on the currency you are in because of exchange rates based on the US dollar. The average round trip on 1 standard lot is about 9.00- 10.00. 5.00 to get in and 5.00 to get out plus the spread. Typical spread is 1 PIP. And all this time I was was a dealer getting hammered. These guys are not a dealing desk and you deal with major banks when you trade. Their platform is extensive and plenty of bells and whistles.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
This will be the last example I will post of this concept that I feel is too risky and not needed to be highly successful. It also makes trading this method very mechanical and almost too easy. I have attached two failures by anticipating a color change. Just wait for the color change on the next higher TF before pulling the trigger. Human nature is to make something complicated in the belief that the more complicated something isthe better it must be. NOTE: 4XMaster please ignore everything I asked for involving penetration of price. You are left with very simple and easily programmable parameters .

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I assume that everyone here is on Metatrader? I could do it for TS - but still don't have it quite exact I don't think. Here is a screen shot - comments welcome.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Why don't you post a screen shot in detail and I will look at mine to see if it looks the same.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Thanks Steinitz! I will do that...first I need to try one or two things - then I'll post sometime tomorrow. I appreciate your willingness to help! Also, can someone tell me the cost of MT4 (including the ability to develop / program alerts and EAs)? If it's reasonable I can code it in both TS and MT4....

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I think repaint is a misnomer for this. The HAS candle is active during the candle's TF and when it closes it is done and does not change thereafter. The HAS candle opens this way: The "bottom" of the candle (which is the top for a red candle) is the average of the open and close of the previous candle. The other end of the candle is simple the opening price of the candle. It then moves as price moves for the duration of that candle's cycle. The candle adjusts during the cycle of the candle, but is defined permanently at the close of the candle and does not change thereafter. I find to get an accurate read it is best to use the HAS candle when it closes.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi All ! Here is the next version of HAS EA. It follows exactly steinitz's rules. According to intial backtests the results are not too good, we still need to adjust/optimize it. You have few parameters to play with: x_magicNumber = 1234 ==&gt; Just leave it as-is x_numberOfLots = 2 ==&gt; The number of lots for each trade x_slippage = 3; ==&gt; slippage x_stopLoss = 50 ==&gt; Your desired SL x_3rdTFCloseConfirmation = true ==&gt; you can toggle the 3rd TF confirmation for exit a trade x_moneyManagement = true ==&gt; if this set to true the x_numberOfLots is ignored and number of lots will be determined according to x_risk x_risk = 10 ==&gt; The precentage of your account that you want to risk for each trade, relevant only if x_monetManagement is set to true x_exitByPriceBreak = false ==&gt;You can decide if you want to exit a trade in case the price breaks the HAS candle x_priceBreakPips = 3; ==&gt; relevant only if x_exitByPriceBreak is set to true. determines the number of pips the price should be above/below the HAS candle in order for it to be cnsidered as penetration. Please backtest/forward test the EA, and post/PM me all you impressions/suggestions/questions. Good Luck ! Note: It goes without saying but i'll say it anyway: this EA is still in BETA, use it on your own risk.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi Steinitz, Just finished reading the entire thread (feel like I need to go and do a grey matter detox!!). Have you made any sort of log of the times of the days that the strategy produces the better trades? It seems on a very brief oberservation, that the best trades are produced at times of increased volatility, being the opens. eg. your last gbp/jpy trade was around the tokyo open, hence the increased volatility and movement. With regards to the current gbp/usd long, I would be very hesitant to take a trade at this time of the day. I am demo testing a london open system, and have been backtesting, and there seems to be a very consistent theme - between now and the frankfurt open, there will be ranging, bar some news event. It might make 15-20 pips, but there is a higher probability of it getting stopped out. It will be very ineresting what happens to the current trade, and I am always ready to eat my words!! Good luck with the current trade, and hopefully, I'll be in a better position to make some useful conrtibutions soon. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Put Bollinger Bands around the price. If its a narrow band, you know its in a range, and I just trade off the bounces.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I am in no way the final authority on this indicator and frankly I like to keep things on the light side (if i'm winning ). I am posting this method because I truely like what I have seen and made thus far. I welcom all suggestions and with a group effort we should all be making serious money. I presented this set-up because I feel it doesn't look like a good trade as first glance but the signals are there and I want to see how well this will do under less then obvious set-ups. Welcome aboard mate.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
4xMaster, Many other HAS type systems have been coded with EAs have also failed miserably in backtesting. I do not know if its due to lack of tick data from MT4 [don't ask me the reason, but I always see this as being the issue for backtesting] or maybe the EA have to be able to somehow distinguish between a trending and ranging market or a better exit entry is required. I guess if the EA method does not work, maybe just give one an alert if two out three timeframes agree to either go long or short. For me, I do not like staring at a screen all day waiting for a setup.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I started running the EA that 4xMaster has coded. God it looks like a lot of work went into it. I like what he has done with the # of pips for penetration. There is some interesting inputs that he has let the user modify. It is worthy of a good work up. Unfortunately I don't have much experience using the stategy tester and don't want to comment on what I am seeing. I do want to say that he provides for stops. I don't have any except those outlined in the strategy by way of color change. I will leave this area to anyone on here that understands my previous posts on what to look for on an entry and exit to comment on the accuracy of the coding on the EA. Thanks 4xMaster it really has some extra inputs that I didn't think of.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I agree. I would like to have some nifty alerts that can look at the current TF and all three if possible.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
It looks like the EA is entering and exiting lookig at only one TF. Anyone else see this?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I have two templates set-up. One is just the HAS and the other is HAS with AH. If I have a close call and need to bring out another tool from my tool box I can see if the AH confirms like the other gentleman suggested. It's handy when you have decided to use penetration to confirm on the next higher TF. If you see the AH confirm you might take it. If you just want to see the velocity of the entry on a color bar confiirmation you can look at the AH and see what kind of set-up to expect. FYI: the AH confirms a 4H long on Cable as stated in an earlier post.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Steinitz Have plugged in all the numbers as you stated, but the candlesticks are still showing under the HAS. I am using the version that you posted. Should the candles that come with MT 4 be visable, I thought only the HAS would be showing. Everything else looks good. BTW: I know this would be alot of trouble, but could your put together all of your views &amp; recommendation on trading this method into a pdf for everyone? I am also missing the MA line if thats what that is that is visable on your charts. Tks for your help. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi Ace, Maybe you have candlestick chart as your type of chart. If you click on line-graph (not sure if that is the name, can't check since am at wrk), it should solve your problem. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I really don't know what you are doing that is different. Maybe you can post a screen shot so we all can see what you are talking about. I will see what I can do later about a pdf. I feel this thread will be useful to see what we finally come up with.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Steinitz, I am trying to see what you are looking at on the 4hr chart. I don't see the red candle with blue wick. Could you post a pic of yours? I have attached a shot of my mt4. Thanks

Steinitz, thanks for the quick reply, I must be thick I just don't see the blue wick on red body on the 4 hr. Here is a closeup of my 4hr. and I believe I have the settings right 2,6,3,2. Is this what your chart looks like? Great stuff so far! I have been lurking since the beginning and have gotten more into your system the farther along the thresd has gotten.

Hello Jokerswild, I really like the HMA, it is nice and simple, how do I get it? Is it already on MT4? With the HA and the HMA together it paints a nice simple picture, for this nice simple chap.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Cheers 4XMaster and thanks again for your patience!!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thats should not happen. It should enter after confirmation from the 2nd TF, and exit after confirmation from the 2nd TF and if the x_3rdTFCloseConfimation is set to true, it also looks at the 3rd TF. Please give me a specific example (the exact time and currency) when it didnt follows these rules. BTW: currently the EA raises debug alerts, which means after each bar close, it raise an alert with the value of the current HAS bars in the 3 TFs. When the rules applies it also opens a trade.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Steinitz, Can you please post clear rules with all indicators on one post? It seems this has splintered and needs your BLACKBOX rules on taking a trade. Thanks, Bagovino

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Yes I agree, make one post with clear rules on how to trade your system.. thanks.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hah Hah! Got it at last!! This simple chap just managed to set evertyhing right!! Many Thanks Steinitz and keep the thread going. Your advice and explanations are a great gift to us all. Thanks again!!!

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Dear Stientiz; Your rules are pretty fine and the system is thought to be pretty fine. I went through the whole thread and got to track all your rules from many posts. I wonder if you would post a clear entry and exit rules with stoploss and profit taking in a single post so a member can follow this post about the system Thanks; Ahmad

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Here are the rules for long entry: 1. lowest TF must be at least one blue HAS candle. 2. The next highest TF must be a " blue upper wick with a red body candle " or a blue candle. and/or price must be &gt;=HAS candle. (OPTIONAL) Here are the rules for long exit: 1. Current TF displays it's first red candle AND next largest TF is a " red upper wick with a blue body candle" or a red colored candle. Here are the rules for staying in trade when current HAS candle turned red . 1. Go to next higher TF and if HAS bars are blue stay in the trade. Note: You only consider wick vs body color when looking at NEXT higher TF. Reverse everything above for a short entry and all rules that followed. This should be a good start.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Like aI said earlier you can't count on me to critique your EA. Your probably right and I will stay out of this until I learn more about using MT4 system tester. Traders here would love to have an alert system of 1-3 timeframes when you have free time. Great work and I hope we can all keep up the momentum to constantly help with your EA.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
People ask about stops and limits. Those concepts are generally accepted to limit ones losses when trades go wrong or take profits when things go right. I really hope everybody here is aware of that. The very nature of my method is the ability to visually see when to get out with a loss or profit by way of colors. If your color blind as one guy said earlier, then you might want to add some stops and limits. Maybe you can't watch the screen all day. Go ahead and set your stops and limits. But the system doesn't require them to be profitable if you watch for color changes. If you need stops and limits that will be your decision that is based on greed and fear. Everyone has their own style and risk tolerances.

Hi Kermut Tks for the heads up on changing from candles to a line pattern. That did it &amp; everythings in place now. That was easy enough, but I just didn't think about the line pattern. Tks again &amp; may we all profits from Steinitz"s great method. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi Steinitz Kermut put me on the correct path ref the candles being on the chart. One question....the line that is seen on your chart, is that the line that would take the place of the candles as Kermut advised? Just making sure that I have everything correct. Your statement about trading 8 yrs I can relate to as I traded stocks for 15 yrs from the investor side then switched to FX in 1999 &amp; have found only one method that works with any consistency &amp; it is for short term trading. HAS method is much better from an indicator stand point as no other indicators are really needed. I'm sure one maybe could be used to comliment HAS, but not really needed. As for EA for this method, that would be great, but I prefer this as a manual method. Adding signal to the indicator would no doubt be a great addition to an already great method. From what I have seen so far HAS works in a trending mode &amp; will define a ranging market as well. The rules you just post would do fine unless you have the time to create a pdf that would include you thought &amp; thing you have discovered along the way, but that is just a suggestion. Tks for your time, willingness to help &amp; the shaing of the great method. AceTrade

WHOA!!!! :surprised I would have started coding in it about 100 posts ago! I'll get cracking.....the Alerts anyway...unless 4xMaster gets to it first.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hello everyone, I must say that I have just found this thread a couple of days ago and really like the way this indicator represents the price movement. Great job Steinitz! I also am enjoying the banter, this is a great group of guys! Question for anyone, I noticed that the software was said to be free - but where do you get the datafeed? Are there any brokers that have a demo which will not expire? So you can use the demo for datafeed and charting on MT4 and have your live account with EFX(or anyone else). Please advise, any help greatly appreciated. Looking forward to future posts! Thanks! Pftick

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi FX Master, I try to dabble in coding primarily by cutting and pasting, and I would like to incorporate the HA indicator in an EA but I don't know what output to use to identify the changes from blue bar to red and vice versa. If you can help me it would be appreciated. PM me if you prefer. Any EA I develop will be shared but it would primarily be used for entry and exits. The direction would be determined by seperate cyclical analysis. Keep up the good work on your EA. I think this may have good potential. Many thanks. G-Man

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Welcome pftick! I second that question - any recommended brokers (MT4 compatible) would be greatly appreciated!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Try looking at Crown FX for a long term demo. G-Man

--- 帖子 #231 ---
You should use the iCustom function for the different 4 modes. Did you try my EA? If you did what are your observations? Regards

--- 帖子 #232 ---
http://www.metatrader.info/node/31 It contains the download instructions and seems to include data as well- It looks like InterbankFX provides data, I see nothing about expiry. Just check the sign up for newsletter seems to be the only request on their part. Take a look -let me know what you think - Hey stepwise, I'm also A Tradestation user, Maybe a couple of converts in the making?? Talk to you soon -gotta go get a Starbucks and download this thing pftick

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Here's 2 MT4 data feeds for Demo Accounts that do not expire: http://strategybuilderfx.com/ http://www.northfinance.com/eng/open-demo-account/ North Finance feed also includes metals, indexes (DOW, SP500, NASDAQ etc.) and futures.

Has anyone had any experience with StrategyBuilderFX MT4?

Thanks G-Man, goldenequity, your quick reply is much appreciated!! Ok - I need some coffe, back in a flash! pftick

Hi 4xMaster, Got the EA working. Trouble was I had too small account to run the MM settings I had, so it was reporting invalid lotsize. So I have it working and I will continue to test on a 1min Chart out of interest. Mind you, 1 failed trade 2 open trades, and its $180 in profit in 30 minutes on a single lot ! So its an exicting start anyway !

--- 帖子 #237 ---
WOW, friends. Im excited to tell you that after re-checking and optimize my EA, im starting to get very encourging results from my backtest. Here is an example: backtesting the EA for 2 months from 1/1/2007 to 3/2/2007 (jan to march) on GBP/USD n 30m base TF gave me the result of 52% increase of the inital amount. Attached you can find the detailed statement. I need your help in backtesting the EA as much as possible for optimize it to the best configuration possible and we'll be on our way to a VERY successfull EA (i.e money machine). So start check it, and give me your observations ! im attaching also an illustration of part of these trades.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
That's great 4xMaster! Quick question - isn't there a danger of over optimizing an EA to a certain data set? If the EA is fully optimized then that means it is "fitted" for the testing period and would not show consistent results from other months / years. Unless I'm missing something....

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Good work. I have one concern though, the moment you start to ptimise it, you are going down the road of curve fit. Never good, or at least not always. Only speaking from experience, but I would be inclined to concentrate on forward testing it rather than backtesting it for optimisation. You can make a straight MA cross profitable if you optimise it! But only on the backtest.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Actually i didnt make any special changes in the original steinitz rules. i just optimized few technical programmatical issues. the rules are the same rules. ofcourse we still need to check it on various time frames and on various different currencies.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
4xMaster, is this EA based on entry after Bar Close ? I think that is quite important, and I just got a short on 1m Cable even though the 5min bar closed blue.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Greetings 4XMaster! Thanks for posting your results so far on forward testing the ea. Are your results from an updated/modified version from this original ea? If so, can you post your current version? Thanks ahead for your hard work and to Steinitz....thanks for the simplicity of this system and your "traders helping traders" attitude......enjoy your success!!!! Goldenequity

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Yes, all the processing is being made according to the bar close prices. Please give me a screen shot of this false entry you are talking about, and i'll check it out.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I have attached it for you. It went short at 16:43, the HA spiked red on the 5min during that candle and then finally closed blue. So momentarily it was a valid entry ! But the 5 min HA did not close red until 16:50.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Thanks for your reply. I am aware of using the iCustom function as fas as custom MA's are concerned, such as; if(iCustom(MA,5,0)&gt;iCustom(MA,5,-1) then buy, etc. but as the output from from HA seems to have several 'values' I didn't know if it would perform the same way. If it isn't the same I would appreciate a sample of code to enable me to add this in. I haven't tried your EA as yet but I will add it too one demo account and make some observations. Many thanks. G-Man

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hello everyone Would someone take a look @ the USD/JPY &amp; give me their view on the signal that has just form on the 15m 30m &amp; 1Hr charts? A red HAS has just started on the 15m, but the 30m &amp; 1Hr are not showing that as of now. They are showing blue. Any views are most welcomed as it will aid me in my learning of this method. Tks. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I would say just stay and wait until there is a red candle in 30 min chart. Any other idea?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hello Seintz, Congrats for a successful system you have here and thanks for sharing with us. By the way, what is the HAS with AH ? I don't realy understand. Would you pls elaborate? Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Medico Tks that is what I was thinking also. This is a great method for getting the trend &amp; not letting the range fake you out. The best of both worlds. Ace

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Good morning traders! I am going to answer every ? I see from yesterdays postings. I have received a lot of questions amd comments. Nice to see this and share in the excitement. The demo is free including data. MT4 and the data feed comes from two different sources. If you download both versions you will notice different closing times on a daily candle and slightly different results in the data itself. I use MIG as my data source. If anyone can elaborate please do so.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
4xMaster thanks for riding shotgun with me on our road trip to paradise! Your data is exciting to say the least. I do agree that we don't want to curve fit and your reply answered that concern. I would like to learn more about MT4's backtesting abilities and optimization options as this requires some focusing on my part to get up to speed. Right now I will look at the results you post and use it to see what kind of DD's we can expect. I know as a professional card counter of 32 years I had the software to see what type of fluctuations I would expect to see with a certain number of trials. 2 - 3 standard deviations were expected and I needed to see what could happen and how often to prepare myself for the battlefield. Looking forward to more. Good work!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Can anyone explain how MT4 actually optimizes? What steps are taken with the software to accomplish this? TIA

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Steinitz On the UDS/JPY @ this time there is a full bodied red candle on the 15m..on the 30m the is a small red candle with a very small wick on the top &amp; on the 1Hr the is an even smaller blue candle with a small wick on top from this info what do you see ahead? Is this a short trade setting up? Tks Ace

--- 帖子 #254 ---
for the response, I haven't looked yet, but I assume that the MIG demo does not expire? Also, when you said both versions, meaning ???? I'm only aware of MT4. If you have time to clarify, much gratitude Thanks, pftick

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Next time you have a question please post your current time of GMT please. I am looking at the pair. At 12:30 GMT 3/07/2007 it was a vailid entry with 30M just turning red (I presume since I can't look backwards) or at least price was definately penetrating HAS bar. And 1H was also red too which is obvious. THis trade made as much as 18 PIPS. If you took the trade via my rules you would have made maybe 2 pips at best.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Correct

--- 帖子 #257 ---
HAS stands for Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed AH stands for Aroon Horn Look at previous posts on using that indicator in conjunction with HAS for confirmation purposes if a trade looks marginal. Nice little addition I might add after working with it for more then a day.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
First... I'm not big on indicators so can someone please explain HAS, HA and AH ??? Especially AH ! What is that and are ALL indicators posted for download? Second... I wanted to congratulate Steinitz on the discovery of this fine method. I know how it feels to break through the Forex fog once you find a method that works for you. It's one of the best feelings!!! I have followed the thread from the start and appreciate the method. I will be monitoring the market with it as soon as I have all the indicators together and make sure I understand it 100%. I think the best features of this method are its simplicity and ease of use, but most of all It looks as if it will keep us out of ranging markets and whipsaw which is the kiss of death to us traders!!! Thanks again Stein! Bagovino

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Stein, Can you post the AH indicator please. It doesn't download for me from the one previously posted here. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi, Can someone please post the AROON again? I cant get the one posted here to work. Sorry to be a pain! B.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Yes it meets all the criteria. The initial entry has that small wick which I usually reserve for the next higher TF. As a matter of fact we might consider adding the small wick on body (two diff colors) as confirmation to the initial shortest TF. Your trade has a good price penetration on the 30M and the 1 hr (less important TF) has been red so you are getting in somewhere in the start to middle of an existing 1hr trend. It's always better and safer to have fresh trends on ALL timeframes. The best trade possible for a short example: You enter on a 15M after seeing 1 or more red candles. Even a red wick on blue body (let's address this with 4xMaster later). You notice the 30M has just turned from blue to red on it's FIRST candle (need fresh trend) this is really important. You don't want to target getting in on the next higher TF if that TF has already begon !!!!!! You notice the 1hr timeframe is all blue BUT the price is diving down into the HAS candles and has penetrated at least 1 PIP of HAS values. See 4xMaster's EA where you can set that parameter from 1 to 3 PIPS penetration. That's cool! This would be a gang buster trade with all TF's fresh !!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
P.S. My Cable prediction from yesterday is in a range. I am not surprised because of the severe downtrend and expecting it to long itself. I was trying for a tough prediction but I am still alive. Note EURO/$$ is the same pattern and succeeded already. The EURO and Cable are highly correlated.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Here are the HAS &amp; AH indicators attached Please read previous posts on using the AH "Aroon Horn" It is helpful to double confirm a textbook entry and confirm an optional early entry on a larger TF using the penetration method.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Stein, Sorry to bother,.... I can get mq4 to work, but I cant get ex4 to work . How do you load an "ex4" indicator. Thanks for the patience! B.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I just noticed that on my MT4 I get different Bid amounts depending on what TF I am on. What the heck is that? P.S. I am up 9 PIPs from yesterday on a 4hr. Keep in mind if this 4hr fails I will have to exit because the daily won't be blue nor the price able to penetrate. Risky trade but pushing the limits on steinitz method. What the hell.......

--- 帖子 #266 ---
To be honest I don't know the difference between these indicators when I see them. I just load all of them in the same experts/indicators folder. Maybe something to do with compiled or maybe one of those is a EA. I really have just used trial and erroe with no formal lessons. Maybe somebody will step up.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Thanks Stein... Can someone lend a hand? B.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Use either bago. Delete the two indicators then put the mq4 file only in indicators folder. Close the platform then open again then attach the indi.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
just put the file in your ...experts/indicators folder and restart mt4. Now the indicator should be in your list. Greets Kpt

--- 帖子 #270 ---
The ex4 file is like a good old .exe file. You load it on the indicator folder and when you reboot MT4, it's there for you to use it. The mq4 file needs to be compiled first using the Metaeditor (it opens automatically when you double click the mq4 file). From there, you choose compile (or press F5) and the compiled indicator in .ex4 format is added in the same folder as the mq4 one. I hope I have made myself understood

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Traders it appears that we have a lot of readership as I monitor this thread of course when I can. I work a lot from home when I am not in the casinos. I would appreciate any guests to get registered who aren't already to enable you to post ideas and suggestions. Would everybody please make a quick remark on what you think about this system? When posting please add any suggestions if you have any. Please rate this system if you have tested others on FF. Thanks Stein-o-rama

Does anyone have a Heiken Ashi Alert Popup indicator popup when the color changes

--- 帖子 #273 ---
This is driving me crazy!!!!! The MQ file pops up ready to go.... the EX file doesn't even show up on my custom indicators list.... WHY??????? Anyone? Thanks and sorry! B.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi Bago, If you have too many indicators on your indicator folder try to remove a few of these. I had a similar problem before and that seemed to work...... just a thought! maluceo

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Have you re-started MT4?

when i have similar problems like this (like today) I unistall metatrader and then reinstall it. But fisrt I save my templates

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Please address 4xMaster and maybe he will give us one. We are sure getting a lot of requests. Cable up 17 PIPS so far......

--- 帖子 #278 ---
@ steinitz Hi, i tested the system the last days and i think its great. just easy to use and the chance to take profit is quiet high. Today i included AH and it´s a great extension to rate trends more effective. I also tried MACD but, dont know, i think it is much better to keep things simple. medico

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I tried everything.... Its not staying in my folder.... I download it, see it in my indicator file, start up MT4 and poooff..... It's gone. AH wont stay in my files??? Can someone make it a MQ??? Bag.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Steinitz, you got a great system and a great thread going here! Your system is basically achieving the same results you would get with a WMA 5 EMA 13 EMA 55 using 2 time frames. Your lower time frame is a 5,13 crossover that has gone one or more time frames and is crossing over 55 EMA (or being repelled by 55 EMA) and your upper (confirming) time frame is a fresh 5,13 crossover. There are variations to this system. Some (Rob Booker) use the 62 EMA instead of 55 EMA. There are other indicators you can use for additional confirmation, but then you complicating a nice simple system.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I just pulled 15 pips from the Cable... Not bad for my first live trade on this system! Bag

--- 帖子 #283 ---
SO looking at the 4 hour cable. THis is currently a long signal correct? WHen was this long signal triggered?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Appreciate the kudos. My goal is to make this thread the best system the FF has very encountered. I know we can do it. It has all the ingredients to accomplish this. Let's perfect the EA, get some alerts and maybe some chat rooms going to exchange ideas. I'm off to the movies soon. I'll be back.....

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Stein, I would reccommend you post screen shots as you see the signals in real time. This is the best way to learn. This way all the readers on the thread can see what you see and get a feel for how to trade the system. Kind of like being a mentor! B.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
If you are referring to my prediction it was made at 6:56 PM yesterday. I mentioned I wanted a signal that looked like a tough canditate. And I had no lifeline on a daily to stay in trade if 4hr failed. It's up 34 PIPS so far. If it does what I think it will be a whopper. Look at Euro. Same set-up as Cable from yesterday.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Guys be careful of the eur/usd and gbp/usd. We have some big news coming. Trading during news is a bad idea as it blows all technical analysis apart!!! (At least for the short term). B.

Ok Bags. I will do that as I did yesterdays few signals. I'll go live when I am in front of my puter. I'm off to the movies. I've been glued to my chair for days now. Now go make me proud!

when is the news comign out?? I"m already long both these pairs.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Steinitz, Here is another indicator showing you the HAS of 4 TF's in one window PS. you will require the HAS indicator.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Steinitz You are correct the 12:30 candle was the once I notice. I'll post the time in the future. This is no doubt a great method for trending &amp; ranging unlike most indicator. Some are saying using the EMA's on two time frame would produce the same results. For me I had much rather look @ a chart the is almost clutter free than numerous line all over the screen, but that me &amp; whatever suit each trader that what they should focus on. The method is very appealing from several standpoints, #1 its simplicity &amp; #2 its accuracy once it is learned. Suggestion//// 1. Indicator that signals 3 time frame confirmation. In closing thanks again Steinitz for sharing this great method even though I have a method that produces fair results this method is by far much better in several respects &amp; I will be converting to it once I have a grip on how to use it properly. "Don't get lose in the CHIP when theres PIPS to be had". Ace

I use 3 tools together to make a seamless cash making machine. The HAS, the new 4 time period indicator just posted, and the Mouteki Trend line tool (attached). When all three are in agreement on at least 3 time frames I pull the trigger. Up $3k today.

Still a work in progress...ironing out some bugs...refresh being one of them

--- 帖子 #300 ---
How do you use this indicator? I'm seeing a trendline and some broken targets??? MoutekiTimetoClose1].ex4 Thanks.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks for the indicator. It is pretty cool to have displayed. Wow this thread is really evolving. I have some questions? 1. If we set the "periods" to 1M,5M,15M &amp; 30M it shows all TF's when the platform is set to 1M. If we change the platforms TF (top toolbar) to let say 30M what does the color bar TF's now represent? 2. If we change the "auto display" from true to false it looks like it just arranges the TF's in ascending or decending order. Is that correct? 3. What is "gap" = 1 value represent? 4. Do you know if this indicator is set close to the HAS settings of 2-6-3-2? Thanks

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Can you explain how you use the Mouteki Trend tool? Thanks

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Still a work in progress.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Now this is one that adjusts the 4 timeframes automatically whenever you switch timeframes (of course the maximum it can display is the Monthly), and allows you to set the HAS parameters. It is modified from the original Forex Freedom Bar indicator, so it still has the refresh problem. It is therefore important that before making any trades you refresh the chart and confirm that what is displayed is correct. Regards, Matsu

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I was actually thinking about this earlier to explain something over again that maybe some people just glanced over. There is a difference between current TF and lowest TF. The lowest TF referrs only to the initial entry on whatever you choose to be your desired TF's i.e. 30M, 1h, 4h &amp; day or 1M , 5M, 15M &amp; 30M. I am know using terminology that includes 4 TF's because of the new indicator introduced today. Keep in mind that all you need is 2 Tf's and maybe a 3rd if you wish. But 2 will get the candy. Now, let's say you enter long (blue candle) on a 5M (lowest TF) and confirm on a 15M also a blue candle or blue tip on a red base candle or price line penetrating HAS candle (optional method). If you are confused STOP and re-read my instructions and come back. Now your job is to forget about the 5M and concentrate on the 15M TF ONLY! Ride the 15M as long as it stays blue. Once it changes from blue to red or red wick on a blue body switch to 30M and see if it is blue. If it is stay in and ONLY monitor the 30M. You never go backwards. As soon as 30M changes from blue to red or red wick on a blue body go to the 1H chart and stay there. You could actually start with a 1M chart and end up with a daily chart before you get the exit signal. They means a lot of PIPS! Note: The optional price line penetration method ONLY applies to step ONE when you enter on the lowest TF and confirm with the next higher TF which you have a choice to confirm with a sold color candle, desired wick color on opposite color body or the price line penetrating the HAS candles.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I am going to re post this every so often as this thread is growing like the movie "The Blob". It will make those newbies easier to get up to speed. Listen you guys are great and I am not going to write a PDF yet until we have a final set of rules. This reminds me of when I first patented a keyless electronic car alarm (never seen before) and because of my need to find perfection I never got it marketed because AI always felt it needed to be better. The bottom line is I waited too long and something better came out. Please let's not make my mistake over again here and try to find something that we can all live with that doesn't become to complicated. Thanks Here are the rules for long entry: 1. lowest TF must be at least one blue HAS candle. 2. The next highest TF must be a " blue upper wick with a red body candle " or a blue candle. and/or price must be &gt;=HAS candle. (OPTIONAL) Here are the rules for long exit: 1. Current TF displays it's first red candle AND next largest TF is a " red upper wick with a blue body candle" or a red colored candle. Here are the rules for staying in trade when current HAS candle turned red . 1. Go to next higher TF and if HAS bars are blue stay in the trade. Note: You only consider wick vs body color when looking at NEXT higher TF. Reverse everything above for a short entry and all rules that followed. This should be a good start.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Nice Work Matsu..... better than my version

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Attached find a full explanation as provided on the Mouteki FF site. These Trendline indicators allow you to pinpoint the time of taking a trade beyond having all the HAS turning the same color. I find that when all colors are the same with the HAS indicator I can look to the Mouteki indicator to see when a trend line is going to be broken. If several TFs reveal similar trendline breaches (or have already have them), I look to smaller TFs to see if one is pending on the 1M or 5M. If it is about to happen on this TF I wait for it then pull the trigger. If if has already happened on the shorter TFs I go ahead and pull the trigger. These trendlines (TLs) form strong resistance and support levels. While the author of the Mouteki method encourages the 4 hr TF, the theory works on any TF. I note that it is particularly accurate going with the trend. Hope this helps.

4xMaster, What is the logic for the EA's initial entry? I noticed that it waits for 2 blue or 3 red bar in the next TF. Is it the expected behavior? I attached the EA in 5M TF then it triggers a buy order when the 15M had 3 blue bars. Thanks. Great EA.

You said when you change the statement to "true" it defaults to 5/15/30/1h I don't see that happening. It reverts to 1/5/15/30 ????

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Excellent job indeedie my friend! I will use this on my platform...... Thanks

--- 帖子 #312 ---
You will need to talk with him on that to make sure it's doing that. If so, it needs to be addressed. It should wait for 1 bar close or optional line chart penetration by "x" amount of pips.

Is it me or do you guys feel like we are really getting a Rolls Royce trading template(s) together here? I personally have two templates right now. Template #1 = HAS + MTF Template #2 = HAS + AH If you guys need a clock I have attached one here I found on another thread.

Steinitz After 8 long yrs I really believe you have discovered the nearest thing to the "HOLY GRAIL" of trading that there is. Nothing is 100% as we know, but I am having excellent results in demo mode so far. Today I followed 3 pairs with the results below. Never have I seen "PIPS" accumulate in such an orderly &amp; methodical manner. Well I know, this is only demo, but I'm sure live works as well as some have surely seen by now. Check the results below. 1. USD/JPY - +50. 2. USD/CAD - +27. 3. EUR/JPY - +25. Total - 102. "THE HOLY GRAIL IS NOT THE METHOD TRADED, BUT THE TRADER" AceTrader

I'm having trouble getting my head around how to use this timeframe indicator with the bars at the bottom. Can you please explain?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Take an example: 5M &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Blue 15M &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Red 30M &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Red 1Hr &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Red Look at the furthest bar to the RIGHT. That is a reflection of what you would see if you manually switched to those TF's one by one. Real time from above example with the settings all in agreement with the 2-6-3-2 You would see a blue on 5M You would see a red on 15M You would see a red on 30M You would see a red on 1hr It saves time switching back and forth TF to TF

Hi 4xMaster Version 1.3 when I turn off MM and use fixed lots it still doesnt allow me to enter any decimal so I cant enter anything lower than 1 lot still, cant do 0.1,0.2,0.3 etc When I turn on MM doesnt open trades so I could be wrong but I dont think it is still trading mini lots

Can the EA check for reversal and close the profitable trade? I mean, close the currency pair per the steinitz rules without putting any Take Profit. http://giobel.freehostia.com/has.JPG

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Thanks 4xMaster for version 1.4 that trades minilots and to Steinitz for posting this indicator and trading rules!!!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Great job Matsu. I think this is the best custom indicator I have seen for MT4. Obviously it needs to update with each bar of the shortest timeframe, but this also seems to change the larger timeframes if the are changing mid-bar. For example the 15 min might change with a 5 min update even when the the time is 10 past the hour. i.e. a new 15 min bar has not formed. As we are generally concerned with the bar status at the close, it might be an idea to have an option to fix the larger timeframes until they confirm a change at their respective closes. Just a thought. G-Man

--- 帖子 #349 ---
May I say thanks for your efforts with this system. Part its attraction is its simplicity. May I ask are you actually resisting trades suggested by the main system based on the Aroon Horn or Mouteki indicators? If so, what rules are you applying?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Tha's exactly what it does.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi All, With this 4TF indicator (great idea by the way!), would a bar turn from red to blue only if the body is blue or even if the wick is blue on a red body? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
No I am not resisting text book trades off the original rules outlined. I will use the other indicator "AH" only to confirm the next higher TF confirmation to enter IF I use the penetration on price.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I've seen that too. It turns ONLY if the whole body is ONE color. Good eye!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
The question is if that is sufficient or if a multi color bar can be painted if only the wick changes color......

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Upon request I attach the MTF 4x HAS indicator that another trader graciously offered earlier. It is a wonderful addition!!!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
If the original author could modify the code to include mult-color candles. How about a multi-color bar painted along with this fine indicator right along with the rest of the colored bars?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Very well explained. Thank you. It confirms my earlier understanding of what you were saying. Thanks again. I would like to go back to the case study on GBP/JPY yesterday evening (EST), I saw red on 15 and went short and stayed on until it turned BLUE on 1 hr, then 4 hr but I was already down 300 Pips. (Price went from 223 to 226) Interesting thing is day still shows red!!! Don't know this is a whipsaw or just I need to have a huge stop loss.. hoping it will come back to the downward trend again.. Love to hear your comment..

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hello Steinitz &amp; everyone I've been short the EUR/USD since the signal was given using HAS. While following HAS on this trade I have also had my current short term method running also. My short term method has given me two signals the downtrend was ending &amp; to close the trade, but GOOD OLE HAS has kept me on course. This method is far greater than any I've seen once the rules are followed. I did notice that HAS has given some blue candles along the path of this trade, but looking @ the next higher time would give a clearer indication of what to do. Am i correct in saying that? So far I am only in DEMO MODE on these trades I describe, but next week will go live if I can continue to understand &amp; learn this method. At this time up 45 pips on the short EUR/USD trade. Following my method I would have close long ago up only 15 pips due to WHIPSAW. My last false signal from my method occured on the 18:00gmt candle. Using HAS clearly still shows a solid RED HAS. Just my views. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #359 ---
If we look at 1.bmp, after so many blues in M15, M30 is still red and so are the higher TFs. This means that you are not yet entering and it had already moved 200 pips. May be I am asking too basic question, after so much been posted. Appreciate any help for my understanding.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Does anyone have a heiken ashi indicator that will alert popup when the color changed, can the indicator be shifted along side of the candle, instead of being ontop of the candle

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I would suggest that if you want to trade GBPJPY on 15/60/240/daily and you are following the rules then you would need a fairly substantial SL if you don't want to to get stopped out, especially during times of high volatility as we have seen for the past few weeks. Personally I think 5/15/30/60 is a good set for this indicator/strategy. This means that most trends can take a decent anount of pips, and the SL need not be too big. I have a few ideas for this strategy in regard to an EA that I will post when I can define them in detial. G-Man

What period setting do you use on the Aroon indicator with HA smoothed? Very informative post.

Hi Folks! I have been following this thread for thre past couple of days. yesterda I installed the EA and put it on the 1HR GBPUSD. I currentloy have 2 losing trades generated that are still running. My questions 1) Are there recommended currency pairs, or can this be used on any pairs? Are there any that should be avoided and why? 2) Is there a specific time frame this EA should be used on? Or can it be used on many 3) If using the 4 TimeFrame Indicator, what time frame should it be applied to? Does it matter? Thanks in advance, you guys are awesome! Keep the thread going and the pips coming. SirWolf

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I need some views on this question.......The short EUR/USD trade that I posted a few back is now getting into a bracketted mode, so what to do with this already positive trade????? The 30m, 1hr &amp; the 4hr are all showing red HAS candle. My thoughts are to stay with the trade or do I close &amp; tp of about 43 pips. If I follow the rules I would stay the course until HAS give a trend change signal, is this correct? Steinitz.....If this keeps progressing I might have enough pips to buys some chips &amp; join you @ the table. Tks for any views. Ace

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I tested the EA last night and experienced the same behavior as yours. Ofcourse nothing is wrong with the EA and thanks to 4xmaster. I guess checking the Aroon Horn will be a great addition. The EA has a difficulty detecting the trend. It does not know if it is trending or ranging. You have to analyze it yourself by looking at 1 hr or 4hr TF. The EA trades based on the color changes of 2-3 consecutive timeframe but it has no knowledge of the true direction of the market. I guess the EA will be profitable by setting a low TakeProfit like 6-10 pips. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
The TF script is black. You have to switch to a background color other than black to see the TF next to each bar. And then use the chart shift function.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Im going out to play poker today. I need a break. I'll answer these questions later. If you re-read my rules you stay in the trade until the current trade turns opposite color and the next TF is no help (wrong color). You might lose all your profit by mechanical approach but I am hoping that in theory this would be the best approach until proven wrong with the EA. I need some chips!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
are there alerts available for the HAS indicator? i.e. when it changes color on a particular TF.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I changed my script to lime. Attached below. Hey Steinitz, thanks for the nice method. I'm several pips up. Now if eur/jpy will just stop changing colors maybe I'll stay that way, lol.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
That is how I see it as well, just needed some comfirmation. On the 1hr HAS (Heiken Ashi) is still showing down, but the 30m shows a change to blue. I entered the trade on the 15m followed up on the 30m &amp; now using the 1hr as the current guide. This is still a in the profits trade following HAS rules.

Interesting comment - I just ran the EA on a 5M GBP chart and noticed during a ranging time (Feb 20 to 28) the EA was spanked really hard - $4,400 loss in 8 days! Also the exits seemed a little odd based from what I understand the rules to be (e.g. Sell trade #10 on Feb 22 at 4:50 - finally exited at 15:35 same day - think it should've happened around 13:30 (blue wick, red body on 30M chart). I've included the backtest report for that time as well as the screen shots that the tester produced. on the other hand, maybe I'm not fully understanding the rules... any thoughts? p.s. - not trying to be negative...thanks Steinitz for sharing your system along with the dedicated support and 4xmaster for putting in all the work to code it!

--- 帖子 #378 ---
If you were running it in 5M wouldn't you want to exit on 15M?

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Alright, cant seem to get ea to place trades, I have enable expert advisor on, running on 15 min time frame, and allow live trading, any other ideas?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Yes, only if you don't want to continue staying in the trade (not using second exit option) - then the exit would have taken place at 6:30 on the 15m chart. But if we use Steinitz' (staying in the trade when current HAS candle turned blue), I think we'd exit with the 30M chart. Looking at Steinitz' exit rules here's how I'm reading them: 1) Current timeframe changes color (5M) and next TF (15M) has opposite upper wick color or whole candle is opposite color. Now with the rules for staying in... 2) Go to next higher TF (30M) and consider wick vs body color. I'm looking at 30M since I think the current TF is in reference to the 15M exit TF we are watching. Because the EA didn't exit the trade from what I would have expected, I wasn't sure if I understood the instructions - but if I'm correct then the EA isn't exiting properly.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
The 8 is the default setting that can be used in any time frame. For example, if you were using a 15 30 60 4H setup, you could plot the following on your 15 minute chart to show you the HMA trends for the 4 time frames: 8 (default) 16 (8x2) 32 (16x2) 128 (32x4) You can do this on any TF using always using 8 as your first HMA.

--- 帖子 #383 ---

Hey guys! Just got back from the Bellagio and made 740.00 in 3 hours playing no limit. I love the tourists! I have included my 3 templates. I am not totally convinced that I will use the 3rd template as I want to read more about the logic of the program and how it can predict areas of movement. It does look nice and has a great little count down clock. Last night I went live and was up 10 pips and closed out 13 pips loss. The 1M, 5M didn't go anywhere and it looked like it could of if you compared it to a move just like it hours ago. The great thing is "you can't fight the tape" as they say on Wall Street. Sometimes there is no logic why it doesn't perform like a perfect set-up. I just closed out following the colors. Here are the attachments.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I have an observation. I believe that short term trading is a bit tougher then longer term for the following reasons: 1. Short term will have whips by nature of the TF (logical) 2. Spread must be considered in TP and/or commissions 3. Short term spikes due to electronic trading or news will be a big factor for success 4. This is subtle but because we are exiting on a fcolor change and this indicator helps keep you in a trade londer with its ability to average and smooth, the tendency will be to lose a large portion of profit from waiting for the exit on the shorter TF's Therefore I suggest to trade longer TF's and even news want change the color easily because of the nature of this indictor taking averages and smoothing. Then when you do exit you will find you had accumulated enough PIPS after giving some back when this lagging indicator gets you out on the "late side". I hope this makes sense. Just my 2 cents worth

Can anyone tell me why the EA is not working on my MT 4 platform? It will put up an alert saying buy or sell, but then nothing changes in the trade tab.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Very nice indicator. It makes it easy to check different TF's without the need to draw a vertical line on one specific bar and flip through the different Tf's. Can you somehow modify the code to incorporate a "split" bar. Meaning when we get that important bar that has a wick one color and body another somehow to program that to be displayed right along side the other bars? That bar would be equal bar length (physically) but split 50/50 in the two colors. Kind cool if you can. Thanks

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I would have thought more profit would be lost on the longer TF's. If waiting for a 4 hour candle to close to confirm exit and the price is going against you, you can lose alot of pips in 4 hours!

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Take a look at your charts and you decide. I have and I know very few if any successful scalpers out there. The longer TF gives you more wiggle room for noise and news. Take a look and see what you think.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I don't like scalping, either. I guess I'm just thinking of the "perfect" setups you spoke of, where you get in on the fifteen min. and ride it up to the daily. I haven't studied it out yet, but right now I'm on a sideways move of the AUD/NZD, entered on the fifteen minute bar and if it goes the right direction I assume I can ride it up to as many TF's as it will go, but if I get just one opposite candle on my fifteen I'm out with just a loss of a few pips. Thanks again for this Steinitz. It's a dandy method.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Im in GBP/USD on a longer ride. I am short and down about 25 PIPS. Thank God I won at poker today. The 4h and daily are red. I have a 50 PIP stop since I am not in love with this entry. The weekly has a split candle down too. Let's see what happens. There were great trades last week.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
How about this? (See attached chart) But it requires 2 seperate indicators due to MT's limitation, unless you can live with only 2 timeframes. Matsu ps. You icon is making it hard for me to resist responding

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Stein, I have a question... Say a trade is going well to the long side, then it starts to turn. 5min - RED, 15min - RED 30, min- RED. When is it a valid short? When do you determine the current trend is over and the reverse has happened? Bag

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hello fellow traders! I think by now we all agree there is something to this method (madness) but it needs some help. I think I found it. I am not going to toot any horns right now and I apologize for keeping this quiet and not starting a new thread tonight. But I will be looking at this over the weekend and promiss it will be better and we will start a new thread if you guys have the energy. I will tell you this. We will keep our same indicators. You will only need one template. If you are looking at mine that I posted it will be the first one "HAS" + "MTF HAS." I know this will work better and I have already seen really promissing results. Here is a hint. It will be based on confirmation colors and buying on dips and selling on rallies. I might have gave it away? I will be back later this weekend and look forward to a new thread.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
As promised, here is the indicator. It is only for those who need to know when the wick colours are differen from the body colours. Make sure to drop it into the same indicator panel. I need to repeat that what I did was only a modification of an existing indicator. The original work was by Eli hayun. Regards, Matsu

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Matsu..... Thank you! Can you make the bars square like before? Can you show a split bar color or is that too difficult to program? Thanks again "I know beggers shouldn't be choosy "

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Stein, Do you have an answer for me? I'd love to know how to handle this situation. Thanks, B.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Bags...... Ok you are long on the 5M. So now you are riding this trade and your 5M turns red so you look at the 15M and it is blue. You stay in. Now the 15M turns red so you look to the 30M and it is blue. Again you are still in. So now the 30M turns red and the 1hr is red. You exit. Your question is what do you do with this situation now? Ok let's see. Your 30M is red so that is your shortest TF and you enter on a 30M if the 1Hr is a red wick candle/blue body OR red candle OR penetration of price method. And so goes your trade etc etc. Does that address your question?

--- 帖子 #411 ---
The additional bars (actually dots) are dots which appear above the original square dots when the wick colours are different from the bar colours. Sorry. Can't find such symbol. I thought you were alright with the chart in my earlier post. How about this now? Maybe I should leave an option for you to change the symbol as well . Regards, Matsu

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Not really... Can you break it down for me. If you can outline a scenario from a long trade turning short, and when to get short, that would help. Thanks, B.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
So say I was watching the 15 minute, and it has been blue for a few bars... THen suddenly the 30 minute also turns blue.. Can I enter the trade at this point? OR do does the 1 hr and 4 hr ALSO have to be blue to enter long?? Edit: Wowzers, this thread has really exploded! Well done.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Your right! I forgot to overlay both indictors. Good job!!!!!!!!!! Your the man!

Not so fast! My colors are not saving. I use blue and red and when I switch TF's they go back to lime &amp; red.

I got it now. There was another window that obviously takes presidence I it works great now! THANK YOU

I will answer your questions but I will start a new thread later this weekend on a much better method using these same tools. But if you must have an answer ok.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Glad you got it straightened out. I actually like the little square inside a bigger square better. If you are like me, here it is. Matsu Edit note: Attachment removed. Error detected. Refer to steinitz's message further down.

Ok your 5M was a good trade and then you got bloody with 5M red bars that look like somebody just got there period. Sorry Turrets again. Now you switch to the 15M chart and as soon as you see your first red bar on the 15M your OUT. Now you can go short on the 15M TF as soon as the next TF (30M) shows it's first red bar! Your now short

I like this better. BUT don't you think that it would look better reversed? red wick = small red square just like the wick. You have it opposite. My opinion

So the Cable just gave a short signle in the 15 minute time frame

--- 帖子 #424 ---
YES

--- 帖子 #425 ---
It doesn't matter. I can see both ways being totally logical. I am leaving it alone. My hats off to Matsu!

--- 帖子 #426 ---
How would you place your stop in this 15 minute time frame short trade on the cable? 15 pips sound reasonable?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Oops! You're right. Attachment removed. Sorry for the error . Matsu

That my friend is the MILLION dollar question. Nobody really knows that answer. Nobody will really figure that out either. You can't predict with enough certainty how much movement any trade will make. Yes you can look at res &amp; supp or BB, MA's etc. That is whY I wanted a mechanical approach to take the psychological element out of the exit. Next week I will introduce something that exceeds this entry and exit. We will all make more money with less uncertainty.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I've been using the indicator below for support and resistance levels. I have seen that this method will take you to the next support/resistance with a bit of certainty. So, what I do is close half of my position when a level is reached (or crossed and price gasps for breath). I move s/l to b/e and leave the rest a bit more. It may not give super pips, but it's safer and this is very important to me. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Can you explain the "yesterday's quotations"? Are these standard FIB levels? Are the fib lines only for the right side of chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Looking forward to that big post you've been talking about. If its really something amazing make sure its before the market open on sunday.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thanks for the answer Stein... It helped alot! No offense to the period thing... I needed a laugh on a stressful trading night! Bag

--- 帖子 #433 ---
In my chart, the lines are dotted and take up the whole screen. As for the info on the left side, it is yesterday's High, Low and Close. Personally, I could do without it, but I do not know how to erase it.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi guys, It seems to me that a couple of you are getting a bit lost with this method so I think we need a pick me up. Always bear in mind that very few methods or traders have consistant success in every trade being profitable. This is paramount in trading, and is effectively the key, in that losses are minimised during periods when performance is below average. It seems that a day or two when trading is not as easy as it was have dented the confidence. Keep the faith. Anyhow, I mentioned earlier that I was going to post some ideas that I have. I mentioned that I am mainly basing my current research on the cyclical activity of the markets. If I can achieve what I hope to I will use this as the ultimate filter on top of another strategy that provides the exact entry/exit rules. Essentially if I think the dominant cycle is up then I would only take long entries, or set an EA to only execute longs. Opposite for shorts. If I think that the direction is indeterminate then I would either stay out or reduce the position size. One element I like of the 4TF indicator is it can effectively highlight the possibility of a cycle on different timeframes, therefore improving the chances of getting a positive trade. The problem is determining cycles this way is that they are lagged, so if you are about to get in according to the indicator you may be at the peak of the short cycle, and higher cycle timeframes are also at a turning point and you are not aware of this until they have turned. I wont continue with comment on cycles here until I have completed my work and determined if the MF HAS is a good indicator or not, and if it is what settings are best. It may be useful for those who code the MT indicator to look at the possibility of having different settings for the higher timeframes as this may allow some flexibility in identifying the cyclical movements. My ideas for an EA, either with or without any cyclical analysis, would be along the following lines. 1) Optional: Determine the direction or trade size using market cycles 2) When all timeframes, or 3 of 4 timeframes, align and in any determined cycle direction, then enter an order with a pre-determined SL at a defined % risk. 3) Exits are an issue. My suggestion would be to run a tight trailling stop. Yes you are going to get closed out sometimes before a big move your way, but I think that you are going to get the majority of trades closing at a profit. As a TP I would set it as the same as the initial SL. 4) If the shortest timeframe changes colour and then re-aligns with the longer TF, then re-enter if the cycles still line up. I would appreciate it if anyone could comment on these ideas, and if the coding gurus could implement them if they think there is merit in them. I would add that my intention would be to run an EA on charts with the shortest TF set at 5 min, and on multiple pairs. I have the current EA set up on several pairs but have only had one trade on USDJPY until I turned off the MM, despite there being many opportunities. This may need reviewing. Comments appreciated.

In closing I just want to say that everybody here wants the same thing. I originally started this thread to get people to see my question about this indicator. Now we have grown to umpteen posts and going strong. I really take my hat off to everybody that programs these indictors. I know what it takes to concentrate and make these things function right. I just wish I found FF years ago. I am by no means the last authority on anything. I just spend a lot of hours in front of charts like you guys. I have spent all my adult life finding various edges in games of chance. I am used to making easy money the hard way. I have achieved everything I ever imagined in casino games and they are my personal withdrawl machine. If interested and you recognize my last name go to Google and type "Steinitz" in there. My great great grandfather was the first world chess champion and every chess master knows steinitz for his opennings. I will be back later to discuss a method that I have used before that I felt is the way to trade with a high degree of consistencty and success of course. I just never had the right indicator to confirm a strong trend. Later....... Steinitz

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Steinitz, we know the entry has good. Have you even considered using the attached file as your exit strategy, set to 3x ATR ? By eye, it seems to look very good at locking in those pips before you lose them. Van Tharp reckons you can make money just with random entry and a 3x ATR stop. I have also read about traders that have tried and confirmed that.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
So the idea being is you place that in your lowest TF. If bar CLOSES above/below stop, time to get out. However if your standard HAS gets you out sooner (which most times it won't), take that exit.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I will look at it. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
hi guys ,interesting thread.i use a similiar kinda set-up and thought id drop in my .M.A.C.H.3 alert,if you use the settings MaMethod 1 , MaPeriod 11 it will give you an alert on the change on the 5 min time frame for your entries. also noticed that the *4 tf has bar indicator* is not updating on time and needs refreshing

--- 帖子 #440 ---
You're right of course.........I think that a lot of people can get too greedy. If you can nail a good entry point and it shows +Pips, a good trader will have the 'feel' to either take or ride the trade. There are losses at this game and a good trader accepts them knowing he can offset them with his mindset and strategy. Personally, I think that your strategy suits me over what I have looked at before and if it evolves into something that suits me better, I will use that too. I have far better entry points and if I can make 200pips a month, it will make me a millionaire. As was stated earlier, every pair has its own 'idiosyncrasies'. Thank you Steinitz and I look forward to your next thread. You obviously know the 'Secret!'

--- 帖子 #441 ---
On a slightly different tack, my Greed point I made earlier, is the want or need which leads the great minds to search for a solution..........long may the inventiveness of man continue. Love the way this thread is evolving....... . Keep em coming and bag those pips!

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Can anyone please tell me how exactly should i use the Aroon Horn indicator for entry/exit confimartion ? thanks

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Search at google and got " Wilhelm Steinitz". Is this your great grandfather? First world chess champion.. salute on him ....

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Im looking at the 4TF HAS bar, and just to clarify, the top bar is the longest TF and the bottom bar is the shortest TF? this is what I thought, but it says MTF HAS (15,30,60,240) 4 3 2 1...Implying that the 15M TF is the top bar? does anyone know? thanks!

--- 帖子 #445 ---
See Post 114

--- 帖子 #446 ---
The TF's are labeled on the indicator- just to the right of the bars. You have to shift your chart to see them. If you're using the original 4TF HAS, the font is black, so your chart background needs to be a different color than black.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Yes. Wilhelm Steinitz is the chess master I referred to.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
hello just be aware when backtesting "Its all MTF inducators repaint because its in developing stage until close of the underlying bar happens." see the pics

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I don't think that is the MTF indicators repainting problem. Everybody knows that when a candle is developing, an indicator will change state, which is why a lot of traders will wait for a bar close for confirmation. In my experience 'repainting' occurs when in realtime a signal does or doesn't occur. Then after the bar has closed, if you reload the indicator or restart MetaTrader, it appears, or it appears in a different place to where is was originally painted. These HAS indicators do not seem to do that.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Guys, what am I doing wrong, all of my 4TF HAS only shows red??? See attached picture. Thanks Dennis

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I dont think so, I am kinda new to MT4.....

--- 帖子 #452 ---
did you look at the pictures??/

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Yes, I am not using the 4HAS indicator, just the original HASmoothed. What you are seeing there is probably why the guy who posted that indicator suggested a reload of the indicator to confirm. So you're right, that one repaints, but the original one doesn't. Either way, its not correct to say all MT indicators repaint because it is due to the bar/candle forming.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I think it would be a good idea if we can edit the first post of this thread to include all indicators used in this method as well as a PDF. This will answer alot of the redundant questions being asked. As this thread grows and more and more traders join, you will see these questions asked over and over hundreds of times... Just trying to relieve a headache for Steinitz. B.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thanks! I love the indicator. I set up a multi screen with just the indicator showing. Looks like the attached. Now all I have to do is adjust tf's to what is best going forward and wait for the signals. One problem with backtesting is the color is not solid until close which on a 4 hour and up tf can change in and out. Pairs like gbpjpy can go up 200 and down 200 in 4hours and do. For catching trends and identifying entries or add points to trend this is impressive. Thanks to all

--- 帖子 #456 ---
From the demo testing I have done so far on this method I am most pleased with the results. Am most interested in what Steinitz is working on that will make this a better method. Whatever it is I'm sure it will get better. As we all know by now nothing will ever be 100% accurate in this business, but following the rules &amp; adding whatever Steinitz developes should put the odds more in our favor. So far following the rules as Steinitz gave in the beginning I have had all winning trades in the demo mode. There are times that you can enter the trade on the 15M tf &amp; have a signal comfirmation on the 30M, 1Hr &amp; even the 4Hr. This is a very strong signal when comfirmed on 4 tf's. Check the USD/JPY pair @ this time to see what it is showing. Start on the 15M 15:30gmt candle &amp; go forward thru to the 4Hr tf. &amp; it shows we have a very strong signal. I'm in this trade now on DEMO MODE &amp; it is up approx 78 pips. Not a bad payday @ all if I was live. This great method can only getter better with practice &amp; adding whatever Steinitz puts together. The only filters I am using @ this time are RSI @14 &amp; MACD @15,26,1 &amp; they are comfirming signals from HAS. I'm not using any other indicators that have been post on this thread, but that is not to say they don't have value for this method. Frankly I have been to busy trading HAS to give them a go, but will do so next week. Not seeing many post their trades so far, if you have any results it would great to see them. My results from Thur are #1.USD/JPY - +61 &amp; #2.GBP/CHF - +90. Previous results have also been posted. These are all DEMO. I would like to thank STEINITZ &amp; all the programmers &amp; others that are adding to the value of this method each day. Have A Great Weekend .

What is happening to you here is typical when markets go from trending to ranging. This is where programing an expert to identify the change is tough when we as traders get so locked into trading a signal we ignore the basics. I know you are trying to create rules to follow exactly but rarely does the market give you that opportunity for long. Works in a trending market but not ranging which cable has been in this week unless you go short from the top of the range and long from the bottom. Your HA smoothed indicator, in fact on the 4hr chart is clearly defining this ranging market. Please note the attached. Trying to program the study of market structure into an expert has been worked on for a long time. For manual trading, what has been brought together here in a very short time is awesome. Thanks Brad

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi Brad Excellent explanation &amp; I totally agree. For me this is better as a manual method. You can only built so much into an EA according to traders I know that are versed @ coding. If someone can develope an EA for this method that would be great, but until then I'll stick with manual. BTW: are those BOX Indicator lines on the chart you posted? AceTrade

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Yes a lot of redundent questions. Like I said we will have a new thread on Saturday night b-4 market opens Sunday. That is my goal. We are going to look at this method in a much different light. The tools are here already and multiple TF's are the key to this. Off the tables today to for hopefully a withdrawl.......

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Well put. I agree. Infact I took Cable this week and got stuck afew pips but I trade live and I don't like losing. I will come back with another major tool in our toolbox. You can trade the new method in ranging markets! Actually it will do better in a ranging market with moderate vol then in a strong trending market. We will have two ddifferent distint methods for all market behaviors. Bye for now......

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Guys, what is wrong with this picture? 4 TF HAS all red.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Look for EUR/JPY to go long from here. It's at 154.88. Within the next several hours unless it needs more time and market closes next target up is 25-28 PIPS to 155.15. Later

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Are colors set to red for both? Seems silly but indicator works fine. Brad

--- 帖子 #464 ---
They are ATR Levels indicator. I just changed the line colors. I will attach. Both Euro and Swissie traded right to them today. The two small lines are just trendlines. Brad

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I think I am getting under control, but I didn't touch the settings, go figure ;0(

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Brad thanks for the explanation &amp; the indicator. Will give it a try. Have a great weekend. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #467 ---
In reference to the USD/JPY trade I'm in what is now happening is the 30M is now showing red, but the 1Hr shows blue for up trend, so what should I do?? I will now keep an eye on the 1Hr tf as it is still showing blue. @ this point we could tp if you didn't desire to hold over the weekend. Since I'm up approx 74 pips &amp; its near NY close before the weekend I will close &amp; tp. On this trade you can see the 4hr chart still shows a nice blue candle. If this was not near the NY close on Friday I would continue to hold this trade &amp; follow is progress. Any view on this trade? AceTrader

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Brad just applied ATR to a chart &amp; it looks great. When does it recalculate each day &amp; any info on its use would be much appreciated. Tks Ace

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I like the indicator, but changed line width to 1 .... easier on the eyes. IMO

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Yes, Does anyone know how to use the ATR lines? thanks!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
ATR From what I have seen they are mostly used for a visual trailing stoploss. Volatility based trading. Hope this helps, GGR

--- 帖子 #472 ---
HI i am using the latest mtf has, indicator and it is clearing repainting Am I missing something s see the pictures

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Steinitz, I am eagerly awaiting your new method. This one works great in a trending market. Now if you have one like you say that works in a ranging market... That is the Holy Grail. Any successful trader will tell you that you need two systems. One for trending and one for ranging. You can actually use them in tandem. Say you get a short on your ranging method, a bit later your trending method confirms it with a signal... Guess what???? You just got in early on a big mover! I am still using my " Bagovino Method " as a trigger for the entry as it works well with this system. If anyone is interested, hop over to my thread and check it out. I take the signals off the 30 min. However, it can be used on all time frames. Again... Thank you Stein and I cant wait to see what you come up with next! Bagovino

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Recalculates Y (yesterday) lines at 0:00 (gmt is best) which will depend on your broker. I use IBFX which put to all live traders last year if we want adjusted and the answer was no. We need a solid base which is GMT in my opinion, I can reset indicators. T (today) lines change when a new low or new high is closed. It becomes important on retraces or violation of same. Solid indicator. Brad

--- 帖子 #475 ---
ATR Levels (average true range levels) is not a new indicator. The problem was the tf when applied to fx (at this current time). When any indicator falls out of bed it is time to re-optimize. I fear with all the settings I knew from 2004 being quoted today many are ripe for a failure. The pro's control. Make it simple. Get rid of the stoch's, macd's (you never took the time to learn how they worked anyways) and optimize daily. If you don't know how, back off and learn. I am part of the 5%. Have been on my knees praying. Now I look for your knee prints. Different philosophy. Brad

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Brad Thanks for your comments, but I think I'm not getting the last 3-4 lines. I'm farmiliar with ATR, Stoch, MACD &amp; all the lagging indicator squad, but was not sure how you are using these to trade. It appears they offer support &amp; resistance &amp; either trade the breakouts or the bounce. Is that correct? Have not used many indicator in the past with the exception of RSI &amp; MACD @ times with RSI being the favored one. @ this time do you find ATR Indicator working as I know all fail @ some point? The knee print in the sand I understand as we have all been there.....Well I guess all of us have. The 5%, is that the winning 5%? I feel more than 5% win in this business......say 10-15 @ best. Tks for your help. Ace

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Early prediction Look for EUR/JPY to go long from here. It's at 154.88. Within the next several hours unless it needs more time and market closes next target up is 25-28 PIPS to 155.15. Later Folks I just got back from playing today and as you can see I predicted the above entry to hit 155.15 Look at your charts right now and you will see 155.15. Right on the money. This prediction is based on my NEW system I will post soon. :

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Guys I've attached the following file for newbies and to summarize what we have so far. I've only included the basics to get everyone up to speed without having to go through the entire thread. Its not perfect but is a start. The HA Smoothed folder has instructions and history. This is probably ideal as steinitz will be unearthing an upgraded method over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thanks for your help. I am very busy running several business and if anyone like XOLLOSIS would like to prepare any PDF's or any tools for purposes of documentation I would sincerely appreciate it. I will be busy this weekend gathering my thoughts on how to present this new method. Let's keep this thread alive since it is a great method for trending markets. My favorite method will be next as that Is how I have traded before without the need to time the market so exactly. I look forward to all the programmers on here to assist with the next version for ranging markets. Best! Steinitz

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Steinitz That is outstanding to say the least. It surely is getting better. I was watching that pair as well, but did not trade it. Check what I posted ref USD/JPY trade I took today &amp; the amount of tf's involved in the trend direction comfirmation. Out until early Sunday. Enjoy the weekend &amp; let get those pips next week. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Can't wait to see your new method...

--- 帖子 #482 ---
You picked a great trade to be in! Great job! If this trade hangs on it will turn the daily blue. Look at the price penetration on the daily chart. Use the line chart to see it penetrate red daily HAS candles.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Thank You Steinitz for sharing your method. I used HA before, but HAS looks better. Can't wait to see the next method. Regards, M. Hafiz

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi, System looks great Just a quick questin. With the 4 TF HAS bar ind on a 1 min chart and lets say the 5min squares are red. Then in the last few secnds of a 5min period the price moves and causes a blues bar on the HAS on a 5 min chart. Finally, the question, back to 4 TF HAS Bar ind on the 1min chart what will happen to the 5 min squares: 1. Will the indicator repaint all the 5min squares blue for that 5min period. 2. Only show a blue square for the last square in the 5min period. 3. A Combo and the one I suspect; Option 2 until the chart is re-opened or the indicator reset and then Option 1. I ask this as I have not yet observed the indicator with a live feed and I was once caught out doing backtesting using a MFT Ind, 60min on a 5min chart. Help appreciated Yelow

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Yellow2 What do you think of the method I sent to you? If you compare Heiken Ashi smoothed with what I have you will see Heiken Ashi Smoothed (HAS) is far superior. HAS is simple in it design &amp; offers several different price levels to confirm your trade direction &amp; the chart is uncluttered. Pull up the USD/JPY &amp; take a look @ the 15m, 30m, 1H &amp; 4H charts......they are all confirming up with the blue candle. I have been trading FX since 1999 &amp; stock 10 yrs prior &amp; this method is better to trade FX. Just wondering what you thought of this method so far. Will only get better with STEINITZ new addition. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Let me just answer your question this way. The last color bar while forming will alwats be in a unstable condition with likely color changes until that bar closes. Once closed it will remain that color regardless of any future action. No repainting with this indicator. If did I wouldn't use as I feel there next to useless information to trade with.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi Folks! Maybe I am not understanding the method correctly when I ask this question. Thanks in advance, you are all very helkful and I am excited by the potential of this method. Lets say I am watching the following TFs: 15M, 30M, 1H and 4H. I see the 15M turn blue so I start watching the 30M, when I see both the 15M and 30M turn blue it is safe to enter a long trade? Correct? Or I can wait for further confirmation of a stronger trade by waiting for the 1H to then turn blue. COrrect so far? Now, lets say I entered this trade when the 15M and the 30M turned blue. If the 15M turns red I am supposed to look to the 30M and see when that turns red and if that turns red I am to look to the 1HR until that turns red. So, my question is, why do I even bother watching the lower TFs. WHy dont I place my trade and just start watching the 1H then? We appear to only be watching the lower TFs and then when they turn we just go to the higher TF anyways. IS my question clear? Am I not understanding things correctly on when to enter or exit a trade? Thanks folks!

--- 帖子 #488 ---
See above in blue.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Thanks Spudfire. I got ya. I guess in my brain was thinking that the 1HR would already be BLUE - but not necessarily. Okay, so let me ask two more questions: 1) Same scenario: 15M, 30M, 1H and 4H. I enter when the 15/30 are both BLUE. I watch the 30 and it turns RED so I jump to the 1HR. If the one hour is RED also, do I exit the trade right then and there? 2) Same scenario: 15M, 30M, 1H and 4H. I enter when the 15/30 are both BLUE. I watch the 30 and it turns RED so I jump to the 1HR. The 1H is Blue so I continue to watch. When the 1H turns red to I jump to the 4H next or do I end the trade. And if I do jump to the 4H, then when it turns red to I jump to the daily? I guess I am confused as to how many TFs to conintue up with or when to exit. Thanks! If I can grasp this piece, I think I am fine. SirWolf

--- 帖子 #490 ---
1. I would unless the 15/30 are blue again. If the 15 has been blue for a while you might want to take a look at the 30 and see how it looks. If there is no sign of blue in the 15/30 out you get. 2. How many timeframes you want to run is entirely up to you. I just run 15/30/1H most of the time. If you think about it, a 15/30 red means you should be going short so riding a 4H blue long at the same time is a contradiction. For example, look at EUR/USD on Friday. The 4TF MTF HAS is 15blue 30red 1Hred 4Hred and we would be in a short position. The price has been trending up for almost 8 hours. If we go by the system rules we are still riding the 30red and still short. If you add another indicator like Mouteki, you would confirm that staying short is the right call. However the 15 is blue and I would keep a very close eye on the 30, if the 15 and 30 go blue I'm going long and won't jump to the 1H short. If you look at the 30 in detail, it looks like it may go blue.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
It would seem to me that some some sort of adjustment might have to be made depending upon the ratios of the time frames being used. For example, if you were using 15M as your lower time frame and 30M as your upper (confirming) time frame the ratio between the two would be 2:1. You're waiting for a time frame twice as great to confirm your lower time frame which is the TF you are actually trading. If you were using 1H as your lower time frame, you would have to wait for the 4H to confirm your entry. The ratio would be 4:1 with this trade. If you were trading the 4H, you would have to wait for the Day to confirm your entry. The ratio would be 6:1 (3 times greater then the 15M 30M scenario). What's the difference you may ask. The difference is that you might be waiting longer than neessary for confirmation before you could enter the trade forfeiting precious pips in the process. I'm sure I'm not the first that has noticed this. Perhaps its not all that significant. I just hate to sit on the sideline waiting for more confirmation that may be necessary on the longer time frames. Anybody have any thoughts about this?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I watch the lower timeframes because if they are in alignment other techs like S/R, trendlines, etc. I can enter the trade earlier (more pips). The longer TF's I think are good for determining the strength of the trend. You enter either/or depending on your risk tolerance and trading style.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
At this time the atr levels indicator is working well on the 14 day setting. It defined swissie and euro very well Friday. Did well on cable 4 of 5 days this week. Of course Friday the action was so few pips neither side got hit. Put together with other signs of exhaustion of a move they can work very well. Learning this HAS method with his settings look like it fits together. If price has crossed more than 75% of the range the levels are reasonably firm lines. Brad

I was just going to add that when the higher TF bar is in the changing mode since that bar has not closed yet you will not be entering in the beginning of a trend early enough. The lower TF is what comprises the next higher TF closed bar. If you jump to the higher TF first you lost some earlier movement. I am off to start the new thread now...... Bye

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Good question! Since the platform MT4 supports fixed TF's I assumed we would all follow the TF's I mentioned in earlier posts. If you have the ability to keep everything 2:1 I would! I just don;t have that luxury with MT4. Yes you would be waiting longer for an exit which would/could be less then optimal in timely entries and exits. Good observation......

--- 帖子 #496 ---
BradOne I have been giving the ATR @14 a go over today &amp; it looks great &amp; a great fit for HAS. Your right the EUR/USD &amp; USD/CHF went to the resistance &amp; turned. I can see this as an indicator to compliment any system. Tks again for the indicator &amp; how you use it. AceTrader

You can use Period Converter Optimized indicator to make nonstandard timeframes. Almost any TFs really. Go here and follow the instruction: http://codebase.mql4.com/indicators/277/ Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Thanks to SPUD and others for the feedback. I understand now and will continue forward testing in DEMO mode with a new understanding of the method. Looking forward to seeing the newer method too. Have a great weekend all!

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I just followed the instructions and turned my 1hr into a 1hr. Looks like you have to go offline first then your chart will update in real time. Unsure about how you switch to other TF's since the upper toolbar is greyed out? I will keep this indicator and instructions if needed some day. Right now everything is in accordance to the standard default. Good to know! Thanks

just followed the instructions and turned my 1hr into a 3hr.

Hi Thanks for the reply. Could you please ckeck the attached Doc (not sure how to post charts) for: Correct use of MFT indicator and entry and exit points. Again help very appreciated Yellow

--- 帖子 #502 ---
aCE Kenmania &amp; everyone Your #531 post represents how I'm trading this method. Start on the 5M or the 15M &amp; progress out 2-3 more tf's thereby getting in somewhat earlier in the move. If you will check my post ref the USD/JPY you will see a clear example of 3-4 tf's in action. Not sure how many times this will be seen, but these are strong moves. On several trades I would start with 15M, but from going over some charts this weekend it seems starting on the 5M might be the best. We all have to remember nothing is 100%. Whatever Steinitz is working I'm sure will add to the stability of this method. Sor far I am only trading this in demo mode, but have found the results to be excellent. Just thought I would pass this on &amp; hope it might help someone . "THE LIMITS OF POTENTIAL ACCOMPLISHMENT ARE DEFINED BY ONE'S SENSE OF THE POSSIBLE" AceTrader

Hi 4xmaster, Can you change the original EA to include a stoploss and TP. Here is what I'm thinking. We dont have to know the market condition. It does not matter if it is ranging or trending. I want to put the EA into 30M timeframe. Rules: 1. Check the present color of 15M and 30M timeframe. Check for reversals. If "both are blue" then wait for color "red" in both 15M and 30M timeframe. If "both are red" then wait for color "blue" in both 15M and 30M timeframe. 2. Basically we are looking for trend reversal before entering because I guess that is the safeway to do it via the EA. 3. We need a takeprofit and stoploss for every order. I noticed that when we enter late the current candlestick bar is going the opposite direction so we dont have to wait for the original rules, we will just put a stoploss of SL=6 or SL=10. 4. Set TP=10 and SL=6 or other combinations that we will test later on. The beauty of this although we are limiting the potential of this strategy is the consistency and automation. Those who have a day job can just run the EA everyday and collect some profits. My objective here is, If I can average 10 pips a day for every currency then this will be my holy grail. Thanks for steinitz and 4xmaster for all your efforts!

According to the rules EUR/$ on 1hour candle just turned blue, 30 min has 4 blue bars.... Signal to go long????? It's 7:30ET..... Dennis

--- 帖子 #507 ---
denis55 That is correct. I am seeing blue on the 15M, 30M &amp; 1H @ this time &amp; I would take that as a long signal. If your looking @ RSI @14 it is above the 50% line, but trying to lay on the line, so this is a trade I would watch closely. I'm showing Pivot Point @ 3120. When the 4H turns blue I would feel better about this trade. AceTrader

--- 帖子 #508 ---
When I first started looking at it the setting was 10. My observations are the market basically moves in a 72 hour cycle. Mixed in that are "dead"days. My current cycle is 14 days. Might be 12 a week from now. 14 is a good start Brad

--- 帖子 #509 ---
meltri those are great ideas and on the lines of what I was thinking of. I've done extensive backtesting and the results are not too bad. However each broker was quite different from each other. 4xmaster what broker software did you develop the EA on? And thanks!

Please start using this thread for ANY ideas that include an indicator that is not contained in the thread titled "Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed" **Start here**. This thread will be used to refer to: Indictors not on original method 1. Additional indicators for exit purposes 2. Addition indicators fro entry purposes 3. Additional indictors for cosmetic purposes i.e. countdown clocks, fun additions 4. Expert Advisors 5. Pop up alerts 6.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I find this extremely helpful for finding precise entries. For example, it is now 20:00 GMT (12 Noon PDT). The USDCAD is showing all long bars on all TFs. One could enter now, but...add the attached indicator and notice that trendlines appear on the charts and they all suggest resistance at about the 1.1780 price. I wait until at least two or three of the TFs show a break through the trendlines before entering a trade. This gives me a more precise entry point. You will also notice that there are dotted green lines above the long/green trendlines at varying distances. There are also dotted red lines below the red/short trendlines. The are projected profit targets that prove to be quite accurate, especially on the 15min + TFs. See this page, post #133 for a full explanation of the use of these indicators: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...?t=7883&amp;page=9 The indicator is attached. Experiment with it, if you wish, on different pairs and TFs and you will begin to see how it can be used to pinpoint entries.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Please be so kind as to post the Yummy Bars indicator. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I understand what you are saying but I would love to see some examples of your set-ups. How about some confirming HAS bars with your Mouteki method showing some entries based on your further confirmation with 1 or more TF's with resistance or support breaks. This would be really helpful to all! P.S. I don't want to post too many different ideas at once to avoid overwhelming everybody so I am pausing before I start another thread regarding the entry of a trade after the trend has been in force. This will compliment or visa versa what "carmel" is doing.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Mouteki...... I noticed that only on the 4hr TF does the text off to the right shift to the left and overlapp the colored bars. Please check your code and advise. Also, I notice that upon starting MT4 there is about a 30 second freeze due to 1 or more indicators. After that period is over everything works fine. Please advise.... Thanks

--- 帖子 #518 ---
OK. I need a little advice on the best way to load charts. In the meantime, look at the pair I mentioned (USDCAD) about 7 hrs ago. You will notice that the bars are in the buy mode but nothing has happened to the price. The Mouteki indicator told me this at noon PDT! Needless to say, I didn't enter the trade.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I think you are on the right track. I see where the candle high broke the 1hr 1.1778 resistance line about 7+ hours ago. My question to you is how far back does this indicator look when alerting a bar's high has penetrated the line? The bar that I see that the indicator is describing is a down candle with a high of 1.1778 that occured at 3/19/07 @ 20:00 GMT. But the bar to it's left also broke that line at 3/19/07 @ 19:00 GMT. So which bar and how far back does the indicator look at? Thanks

--- 帖子 #520 ---
The indicator looks back at the last two points where (in the case of the upper green trendline) the bar high price was preceeded, and followed, by two bars whose high prices were lower than its was. It will connect with the most current pattern. Once a new pattern is discovered as time progresses, it will identify a new trendline and the previous one disappears. For the bottom red trendline the same principle applies except the lowest price points connect. The more reliable, and less frequently changing, trendlines are the longer TF trendlines. Once again, if I am considering entering at a particular TF I look to see where the price is in relation to the TL. If the bars say "buy" but the price is under the TL, particularly the TL on the lower TF, I will wait until price breaks through and then pull the trigger. The link to the document posted above on the Mouteki method is helpful to get a clearer understanding.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Rarely do I see HA indicators that appeal to me, your yummy bars looks nice though. Is this your own creation? cheers

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Thank you for the explination. I do have the word doc saved on my computer and I remember reading about the two bars on either side of the bar in question. I will look at this more to see if the upper and lower targets get hit and how often. Thanks again!

Carmel.... Can you tell me what the UTD (two sets of pricing) and the LTD (two set sof pricing) mean at the top of the indicator below "step 1" mean? Thanks

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Can anybody explain the "fmm_pivots" indicators markings off to the left refer to? There are many abbreviations and would love an explination on them and if this pivot calculator is worth using? Thanks

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Looks interesting. I, too, am a big fan of Heiken Ashi variations. Could you post some more information on yours? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
The various "R" levels refer to projected levels of resistance. Likewise, the "S" levels refer to projected support levels. The "M" levels refer to midpoint levels in-between these levels. All are computed in relation to the "pivot point". The pivot point and related support and resistance levels are calculated by using the last trading session’s open, high, low, and close. The calculation for a pivot point is shown below: Pivot point (PP) = (High + Low + Close) / 3 Support and resistance levels are then calculated off the pivot point. For example: First level support and resistance: First support (S1) = (2*PP) – High First resistance (R1) = (2*PP) – Low Second level of support and resistance: Second support (S2) = PP – (High – Low) Second resistance (R2) = PP + (High - Low) Obviously.....these computations are done by the various pivot plotter indicators available, but demonstrate the concept. I used to have to do these manually years ago! I like to use these, in addition to Camarilla lines and Fibonacci lines, to help show levels at which the market is likely to stall or take off from. They are not a trading system unto themselves, but are a valuable tool (IMHO) to have in your trader tool box. BTW.....thanks for posting your system! It looks great in my testing so far.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
These are the points that connect to form the upper and lower trend lines. YOu will also notice on the left that the indicator actually projects price points. On the longer TFs these are amazingly accurate, especially when going with the trend. Can you tell me what the UTD (two sets of pricing) and the LTD (two set sof pricing) mean at the top of the indicator below "step 1" mean? Thanks[/quote]

Unwanted results though on entering long usd/jpy on a flat scene , but with has signals in place. i give up 5-6 pips w/o spread at one quick move down on the flat line.

Don't use the 4TF HAS indicator since I just found out it repaints. Just stick with the HAS indicator on top only. You can still look at multiple TF's with that sole indicator.

I dont see the indicator repainting Steinitz. It just works the same like any other MTF indicator and has the same issues. E.g. the higher timeframes will change to the closed value of the higher timeframe when you refresh/switch timeframes. I woul love to see somebody would modify this indicator to show only the last closed values for the higher timeframes though. What I mean is NOT to show the current developing candle values but the last closed values for the higher TFs. Dont know if it can be just shifted a candle to the left?

Thanks Stein for summarizing, confirming and clearing this up. I also post these indicators in BAT thread, I am thinking HAS and BAT can work together, in what relationship is what we are going to find out. Stein, you have fireful spirit to support this method, that gave us enough power to boost. My hope is we all don't give up. Our challenge is also dealing with news, turn it off or change setting.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Mason..... Thanks for your kind words. Nothing great is easy. This set of indicators gave me a scare when I saw some crazy painting. If I wanted to repaint something I would hire a handyman! Drum roll...But seriously were good now and back on track. Please visit the other thread labeled "entering midway". You will find that " Matsu " has kindly modified the MTF indicators to enable us to set the periods as we wish. Now the platform won't be taxed hard and you won't experience the freezing from all the data being collected. He has set the indicator at a default of 500 periods. Nice addition!

I was very interested to find this system on FF last night and felt that Steinitz has done a great job. But today I read most of the relating threads and felt confused that should i still use the 4TF HAS &amp; 4TF HAS2 indicators since Steinitz juz found out that this indicator repaints itself. I saw so many rules in the " http://forexfactory.com/images/misc/paperclip.gif HAS Indicator **Another Method for Entering Midway** " thread and " http://forexfactory.com/images/misc/paperclip.gif Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed **Start Here** " and I don't know where should i start from. Or should I just use the Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed indicator ONLY? Please help..thanks

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Max...... Thanks for joining up with us! I know it's a bit confusing but remember to stay on the thread that best matches your posts. Any good method should go through a lot of analysis to make sure it performs as advertised. This set of indicators have been modified since inception. There was the appearance of repainting because the MTF indicator doesn't automatically refresh. You must switch TF's from the MT4 back and for one time to get a refresh then your good. Just do that from time to time. If you don't want to bother with that (I don't mind and I am really anal!) then just look at the HAS and switch TF's to see what they look like. The HAS works perfectly with no issues and no refresh issues as well. Go to the thread that says "start here" and download those indicators. They are the newest set with no issues except refresh. They work great in all other aspects.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Thanks for your help again. Do you mean that from time to time i need to switch the time frame once to refresh the indicators(4TF HAS &amp; 4TF HAS2)? This isn't being a problem to me, i just want to ensure this system is working as you mentioned in your very first post in the other threads. Because there are other systems in other sites that caught my attention and I read thru hundreds of posts and finally somebody came out from somewhere and found out that there's some bugs or disabilities in the indicators that caused the system became useless and bla bla bla... and finally, i got dissapointed. I was scared that this one will be the same like those...therefore I just wanted to make things clear, didn't mean to be offensive. I've attached the indicators as explained in those posts, but i get this... http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/8651/usdjpykp9.gif What happen to the 4TF HAS + 4TF HAS2 ? Is it because of no active tick of data coming in during weekends therefore the indicator(s) isn't performing well? Or did I make any mistake during the installation of the indicators? Again, Steinitz, i pay my respect to your generiosity of sharing your knowledge with all of us. May the pips always belong to you!

--- 帖子 #548 ---
No problem. And no offense taken. The method and indicators are perfect at this point. When somebody finds a way to have the MTF indicators refresh automatically we can say that our job is done here (indicator wise) and move faster towards other trading concepts. Don't worry I am anal and my nature is to analyze until I feel comfortable. I don't want to be disappointed like you so I share all my thoughts good or bad as I see them. I want to expose all angles of this method to all the brains on here to see if we can come together to make this a great system. Your image shows a problem. You need to uninstall the two MTF indicators and re-install them. Make sure you install the 4TF HAS BAR first. Then install the other one 4TF HAS BAR2 right on top of the other indicator. you will need to open the indicators and change the color settings only. Close the platform and re-open and it should work. Make sure you go to the beginning of the thread entitled "start here" and use those indicators. They are current!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Great job on the TF, multi time frame visibility is key. Notice indicator window 2,,,,M A C H and Absolute strength histo resemble the TF indicator at the lowest time frame....regardless of which time frame main chart is. I like Absolute strength because it gives an indication of the strenght of the TF move weather it is with force or just a general meandering direction. I used to use Bollenger Band Squeeze for this..attached setup I use. including Template,,,just to give an idea of what others are doing along with this indicator.....Thanks for all the work and super info...........

Hi Thanks for all the hard work for getting this system running I just have a really dummy question, how is this done("Then install the other one 4TF HAS BAR2 right on top of the other indicator.") and why is necessary to use two different ones. Sorry folks I am new to MT4. Cheers

--- 帖子 #553 ---

I have the same problem as max.. I reinstalled several times, dragged as instructed, etc. Still have same results.

Check out this candle - it has a tail.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
There are candles that show an upper or lower tail. Most candles have an upper tail. There was a trader on the thread awhile ago that explained how the indicator works mathamatically. I believe if I am not mistaken the OHLC is used to perform the calculations. The H/L creates the tail and the O/C creates the body. If you look at your charts you will see that the wick/body ratio goes in favor of the wick when there is less volatility.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
If any of you still have not been able to load the indicators rest assured they work. You are doing something wrong. Go back to the thread at the top of the forum and re-read how to load and use the system. Remember that the HAS will be on top of the platform window. The 4TF HAS BAR &amp; 4TF HAS BAR2 will take up the same place on the lower portion of the platform. The two indicators get dragged and dropped in the same place. Refer to the instructions on the settings for these three indicators. It is worth your time doing this as I don't see any new strategies posted anywhere that out perform this method. Am I biased? Absolutely!

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Still hoping somebody out here will program an alert with a pop-up window. If you are interested I have an alert to signal when you are close to a horizontal line or trendline. You can set the values. I saw it on another thread and borrowed it. It is not what I am looking for since an alert of the color changes would be better.

Hej steinitz I hope this is what you are looking for.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Someon please add Alert popup and email

--- 帖子 #568 ---
I didn't see any alerts come up. You should try to add the alert to the either the HAS indicator or the 4TF HAS BAR. Thanks

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Make sure you delete the old "4 TF HAS Bar2.mq4" file in dir. \experts\indicators, then save the new one from # 566 . Open it in MetaEditor ,insert a emty space and then compile it. If you then open several charts windows with differents symbols all set to 1MIN. for testing, I'm sure you soon will see popup alerts window comming up

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I appreciate you trying to help but I can't seem to get this alert to work more then once. Yes I saw an alert once at the wrong time. If you load the indicator and close out MT4 and re-open it the compiling takes place automatically. I tried several attempts with no success. Even a manual complile. The ex4 file does exist so that is not the issue. For this alert to work I would expect the following: 1. On the currency of choice whenever the TF turns from red to blue or visa versa we should get an alert. 2. If you change TF's from 1M to any TF higher with a different color for the higher TF that should also give us an alert. Is anybody getting this to work out there?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Hi, I am new to this system. Looks very promising. I have donwloaded all the indicators and the EA.

Traders: Here is what I have so far that I have closed out since last week of trading. The only reason I have one trade with a loss is because I closed all my trades out and didn't see that I had one trade with a loss. If I had seen that I would have kept it floating until it profited or the colors told me to close. I want to reiterate something here also mentioned by Ace on an earlier post. I am unhappy for two reasons: 1. I am showing the entire trading community a trading method that is so simple and clear in design that dwarfs all other systems on the market. That is a bold statement to make. I will back this up with my recent statement. Yet I don't see the contribution for EA's and simple alerts. 2. I am unhappy with "Merlins" unwillingness to give me back my moderator status from a petty previous issue. I need that status to arrange my threads. At this point you might be wondering if I really care since I do have a method that can make me wealthier beyond expectations. Here is the answer. I still believe there is some room for improvement that takes multiple minds to get this done. I could leave like some other moderators and start a website and charge. I am not planning on doing that. I could ask you traders who believe this is a great thread to follow me elsewhere I am not going to do that. I just want respect from this site and regain my moderator status. Maybe I'll never get it back and this post will further solidify the unresolve. I ask each and everyone of you (if you like this thread) to email "Merlin" and tell him that you feel Steinitz should have his moderator status back to organize the thread. Steinitz

Hi, I could be very wrong but perhaps you should consider the option that maybe your system is not as good as you might think. I mean, in the end it is just another moving average presented in a different way. Try creating a 12 ema and you'll see it moves just like your indicator. Moving averages, as you sure know better than me, work good until the market turns choppy. For ranging markets, they are great....but in choppy times you'll end up loosing most of your profits. As far as the MTF....the problem that you have to constantly manually reload it to refresh it makes it not so reliable. I do not want to bring you down, so please do not take it personally, but when you are convinced you have got the best system and yet people stay away from it, you have to start to face reality and ask yourself: "am I being biased?" Once again I could be very wrong so ignore me if you want, but I hate to see you feeling so desperate when people are not contributing to your thread. Regards, Future

I take no offense. There are thousands of traders on here including yourself because you haven't found a way to beat the market at least consistently. If you or I was making money on a daily basis I don't know about you but I have better things to do with my time then chat with everyone and answer the same questions over and over again. I am putting myself out on the line which is more then I can say for most. I just downloaded a 1000 indicators and 500 EA's. What does that tell you. This is like playing chess with a grand master after 6 months of practice. I have not heard of one EA make consistent profits yet. Why is that? I know a lot about statistics and the long run. I am just trying to be up beat as possible and have some fun trying to come up with a good solid system that has an edge. The key word is "edge". Opinions are like A holes, everybody has one. No offense!

--- 帖子 #579 ---
This indicator shows a lot more than a 12 ema. These are candles, not a line on your chart. I personally like it. This thread is all about improving the system not bashing it. If you have any improvements, please share them. As far as programming help, maybe we have reached the limit on what can be done.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
EXACTLY !!!! And this is what happens to most systems in here. Somebody comes up with one, then 3000 other people work on it trying to improve it changing 3000 things. In the end, the thread is abandoned and people move on to the next best thing.....repeating the whole process once again. Why ? Because, once again, no matter how hard you try, as soon as the market starts becoming choppy, there is no indicator or set up that will save you. It is always the same story unfortunately. This is not an attack to this thread, not at all. I actually downloaded all its indicators and tried it out, but once again it fails in choppy times. Regards, Future

--- 帖子 #581 ---
There are thousands of great indicators and "systems" out there. Success comes down to the trader. There is no holy grail "system" - only systems that give good entries which this one does. The holy grail is money mgt/trade mgt. and how well you can figure these things out. There are lots of tricks you can use such as scaling in, scaling out, putting qualifiers for entries AFTER you get the signal (such as put a 15 pip qualifier away from the market when you get your signal) so you filter out weak signals (tight ranges), moving your stop to breakeven as soon as possible, t/p 1/2 position after X pips and move stop up for other half and let it ride, etc, etc, etc..... The list is endless and mostly up to the trader to figure out what works best on what pairs and timeframes. Steinitz may makes millions off this simple "system" while the next guy can take the same trades and blow his account because he doesnt have a clue about money mgt or trade mgt. It's up to you to qualify the signals and make it work just like it is with any indcator or "system". [ADD] PS - Mr. Future - this was not directed at you personally. I am just making statements in general about most systems and indicators and it just came to mind after reading your post. Just wanted to make sure I didn't sound like I was attacking someone or anything.

I like the MTF HAS indicator in a choppy market! It tells me to turn it off, and take a couple of days to relax and get away from the house and to get off my computer. Then, when the market starts trending again, I can go back to my trading.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
If someone asking about 8 TF of HAS and BAT, here it is. I personally enjoy reading both positive and negative view as it brings balance from different people, as I mentioned earlier HAS parameters are MA parameters, but since it is HA, it gives us colors, combined with MTF, it brings new set of indicators, it is up to us to translate this into signals for open or close trade, Stein has done great job in explaining to us, eventhough I surely will be glad if stein or someone compresses the whole explanations into single document with clearer terms. If I may suggest let's use description something like this : we are on H1, 1st TF &amp; 2nd TF are blue, lots of bars before it are red, look for better price to go long, it could be retraced 5-10 pips, watch for close price using line chart. 1st TF means current TF which is H1 2nd TF means next higher TF which H4 This will guide us for the rest of other explanations.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Mason..... Thank you for attaching the indicators. I loaded them and really admit I haven't a clue what there are representing. Maybe you could explain in detail how to load them properly and the meaning of the settings. I have included a set of indicators that I asked to be coded on the Forex TSD website that a gracious member put together that almost works perectly. The only thing it is lacking is the text off to the ride side indicating the TF's. However it works great in all other respects. If you place these indicators exactly like you loaded the other 4TF HAS BAR's but in their own location above the original ones you will have a total of 8 TF's. Maybe somebody could look at the code and have the text coded so we can see the TF's. So to re-cap we now have 8 TF's on one screen. I do want to say this however. I don't see the advantage of all 8 TF's displayed. I couldn't know this until it was coded and used. I actually prefer to leave the original method alone and physically switch TF's on MT4 to get a feeling of the trend looking at angles.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
The ...2nd indicators are the same functionality that show 8 timeframes, 8 TF indicators only show blue for long and no show for short, because limitation of MT4 buffer arrays. It is our choice which one to use, as long as we know how and why to do it.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I've thread through this thread trying to decipher what your final system looks like... and I can't find the verdict. Never mind the automation/EA for a moment. How exactly are you entering trades, and which version of the parameters are you using? The original indicator correlates quite well with crossover systems &amp; the like. The real benefit is that you are able to ride long runs quite well with this HAS.. Anyway please post your most recent parameters/Indicator and I will try to come up with a decent way to enter/exit on long runs. If you have already found a satisfactory method please describe it or link to the post.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
What I find is the best for me is scalping: 1. Start at the highest TF 2. Now move down TF by TF until you see a counter trend 3. Once found you enter on this counter trend in the direction of the main trend. That's about it. If you want to fine tune your counter trend entry just look at one more lower TF and wait till it starts to reverse. This way you will avoid being in the countertrend too lond before it comes back your direction. There are pluses and minuses. If you wait to enter you could loose some initial PIPS. However, this confirmation wait can help with drawdown and certainly does.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Please go to this thread and read the word doc file to learn the original method: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=21899

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Ok, thanks for clarifying things. This method will only work in strong trends (I'm using H4 charts as a base, H1 if needed) because the corrections are detected by the smaller TF with some delay that allows you to make a decent buy in the dip. In sideways markets however, you will die... I am trying to come up with ways to strengthen the probability of the entry points using the H4 chart only. One good way so far is to use the length of the candlestick you are entering on - good entry candlesticks are comparable in length to the wicks/bars drawn. This way you can avoid spikes and the like. Also, if you complete the first blue bar and the previous candle was a good solid move up as well, then you can see you are buying in the right direction. Exiting is a trickier matter though, good luck with that.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I think you might be over analyzing this. I understand about trend indicators and sideways markets. The beauty of this I believe is the simplicity of how the HAS indicator gives me at least the best visual on trend strength and MTF visuals. If I am in a up trend with blue from 5M to 1month I cant see How I going to take a beating on my counter trend entries on any TF's.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I see so many posts with attachments of indicators, etc. Is there a certain post that has the latest each time, or do we need to follow along? In Other words: Can I be sure that I'm getting the 'latest and greatest' indicator if I look at thread #1? Does a definitive EA exist for this method? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I am posting my statement from yesterday. I am closing trades left and right with profit. My closed trades are up well over 1380 PIPS since all those little losses are platform errors. I have not had an actual losing trade yet. Even a sizeable losing trade wouldn't phase my account. Keep that in mind....... I am getting emails pouring in. I am replying to everyone of youas fast as I can. Each and everyone of you will get a return email. Membership has grown to just over 100. Here is the biggest news yet! Bluto has finished a preliminary EA and it's making a lot of money. I will be talking to him about the logistics of our next move. I want to talk to him personally and see just how much this ATM is giving out. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Notice: There are two methods to this strategy!!!!!!! Please don't get frustrated. They both work. I prefer the scalping method which yes looks like a complete opposite strategy. They are both uniquely different and produce different results from different entries. Things are heating up. I will be in touch with the members as I figure what the next step is on the EA. AS ALWAYS GO TO: http://www.forex-tsd.com/suggestions...aled-here.html That is where I am doing most of my posting. You can read the latest and greatest on the two methods there.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Stienz Well I did PM you this method of gettng in on counter trend I worded it getting in on resumption of trend right after u started the first FF thread so maybe the strategy is a little different I like to look at the lower time frame to get in on the resumption of the trend that works pretty good even just using the 15 and the hourly. Regardless to get those results you made sure the monthly and weekly and 4 hour and 1 hour were in the same direction and took trade off 15 minute resumption or just the 1 hour counter bar because those bars can last awhile and pile up? and did you use any stop method or you just waited for them to pay themselves out? Anyway am so glad you stuck with it. Keep up the fine work!

Hi Can any one explain what does the 4 TF HAS Bar MEan? Where is it in the Inter bank Fx platform. IF so How to Load this indicator. I couldnot find this indicator. Please Help............

--- 帖子 #596 ---
I am in some trades right now that are drawing down 3 figures. But remember I have never once used the actual technique to scale down that 1 TF waiting for the alert to enter. That will absolutely cut the drawdown in half or better. I am looking at pivots and they hit the S2 and S3 and are coming back quickly. I will post my results of the 10 trades once I close them out. If anybody has not received an alert and want to become a member PM me. I will also later be releasing other programs that have been developed that can enhance your trading esperience. Please don't ask about it yet as it is not crucial to have. I am waiting for other programs (EA) as my first priority...... Cheers!

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Yes to all the above. I made sure that every highet TF was in the desired direction. I usually enter on a 30M and higher, never lower so far. I want to leave the computer and come back to see what awaits me. I am actively on ForexTSD. That is where most of the programmers hang out. Don't forget to PM me to become a member. There will be priveledges in being one. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I don't know about your platform. Just load the indicators and my template. The 4TF HAS BAR is to visually show you what the 4TF's look like at a glance. It also help identify by colored squares where to enter and exit. Cheers

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hello Steinitz, I was hoping you have found or modified the Heiken Ashi Smoothed indicator to run an email alert option. If so can you post it please? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I was wondering if someone can help me. On the left hand side of my screen the EA print that the 1H trend is short, yet if you look at the bottom in the indicator pane you see that the 1H is long. Any reason for that?

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Don, this is the best system I have ever used. I call this my (ATM) system, Automatic Teller Machine. 30 Minute EUR/CHF. I added a 5,13,2 Macd to the bottom.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
What settings are you using? I have set up the ea on two different platforms and it keeps posting losing trades on one and the other it won't open any. Would you mind sharing?

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hi I am using settings #1 here. This week, I started testing Don's settings #4 and had phenominal results. As of this post, I have 27 winning trades this week. Check out the new posts on his site. Anybody that wants to check out a great system, send me a PM. Attached is my statement showing 11 of these in last night within a 4.5 hour period. I am a big lot trader and removed this area and other personal info. Many Pips!

hi id like to test this system can someone send me there template? thanks

--- 帖子 #608 ---
a) 2.1 is the latest EA for this? b) have searched high and low. where can I find the meaning of the input parameters, e.g. p_priceBreakPips

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I think you must contact Don, there is a version 2.31, I am using it at the moment Regards

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Thanks. Cannot find Don on the Members List. Suggestions under which login/avatar he goes?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
PM me for the information for this system. I am up 32 Wins with Don's system this week. Thanks

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hello WHTenn,do you have to use metatrader for this system or can you use it seperately from that? thanxs.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
System drawsdown and loses money, waste of time and money.Many saying they make money is just the sellers.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I'm not a seller and I don't believe in EA's, and have never corresponded with Don up until the time I ordered. This EA was recommended to me so I bought it and started it on Sunday afternoon. Yes, I went with no stoploss (demo acct.) Yes, the drawdowns were huge and I wrote a pm to the person who recommended it saying basically "wth". But, 14 hours later, almost every one of those trades is now closed at a profit. 12 wins in a row on 8 pairs is not bad for the first 30 hours, especially considering I haven't studied this system, didn't read the instructions and don't know what most of the EA settings even mean. You really can't get any lazier than that, unless the EA had been totally free, which it almost is. Will I use it on a real account? I doubt it. I don't like drawdowns, and, had I had a stop I could live with, many or most of those 12 would have hit it. So how will I use it? Right now the plan is as follows: 1. Study and understand the HAS fully. 2. Let the EA continue to run on demo. 3. Study the trading system and fully understand it. 4. If it makes sense after the above steps, and if the crazy thing is still winning every trade, then what I will do is watch for a huge drawdown on a position, watch candlestick patterns for my entry, and take that trade in my real account, assuming that the EA will eventually get its 12 pips, and I'll catch that plus the amount of the drawdown.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Curiosity has gotten the better of me; so blue I have a couple of questions if you don't mind. Please define "drawdowns were huge"? Pip value would be nice. I trade Dailies, and one man's "huge" may be another man's "usual". (That almost sounds obscene when I say it out loud......lol!). Did all of the original eight trades have the "huge drawdown" before coming back into profit? Thanks for the info!

--- 帖子 #616 ---
My reaping today with this method

--- 帖子 #617 ---
I haven't kept track of all the max drawdowns, but a couple were over 100 at least once, others were 70 - 80 or thereabouts. When I wrote the aforementioned email, I had 5 open trades, total dd was 334 pips. Also, I corrected my earlier post - there are 12 consecutive wins in the first 30 hours, T/P is at 12 pips. I need to really understand this whole thing, it's worth the time to look into it, and the EA is certainly worth 50 bucks.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
hi blueruby, did you trade with EA or manual?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
EA - how about you?

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I trade manually, that's why I feel so stressful with this indicator. Could you please post the EA here for me to try out . Thanks...

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Latest versions are not free anymore - $50 which I consider is unbelievably cheap for a system like this. I ran demo for last 24 hours on 1 currency pair, without understanding most of the settings, and achieved 96 pips in that time! I can live with that if it continues. Max loss was -17 pips, max profit 39. I bought the system yesterday, and Don Steinitz sent me a whole lot of statements from people with unbelievable profits - avg 750-1500 pips per month. It seems to work for some.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Here are the trades since Sunday afternoon, 7/29/07. I overwrote a couple meaninless columns for the max / current drawdown and pips profit. Profit would be higher except I started it on the default 0.1 lots; after the first 4 trades were entered I upped it to 0.5 lots. I agreed that DD were huge because of the R/R.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
hi blueruby, yeah, 50 bucks for such a good EA is unbelivably cheap, however at least give me a try with it even though it's a time limited+lot limited+profit taking limit. Just give me a link or contact person or something that I can get the demo version of this EA? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #624 ---
On this forum there is a version 2.1 which is free (I cannot recall the post number). V2.31 is the latest commercial version, and I do not think it is available even in demo free. The person you are looking for is Don Steinitz, and he has 'moved across' to another website's forum.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Ok, I will try to search it in this thread. Thanks gifog . I really don't like to trade with this indicator manually. If you missed a moment on screen, you will be burned. I lost 80 pips yesterday.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
To the best of my understanding, the older version (the free one) tries to identify the beginning and end of a trend as soon as possible - but doesn't always achieve this. The newer one works on counter-trends, which I think is another way of calling retracements, ie it is better at entry/exit. There is an enormous amount of discussion around the recommendation of non-stop-loss, or drawdown. I have asked Don this question myself, and in one phrase, his thinking can be summarised as follows: the strategy is about trade with the trend, and any price-deviation from this (ie drawdown) is only temporary. So I asked him what about a 9/11 occurence, which could wipe out your complete account within minutes, and his answer was: 'you could also be hit by a bus tomorrow, but what is the likelihood of that'? Makes one think, doesn't it. It is a very different way of looking at things, as 'all' of us have been told time and time again to 'never trade without a stoploss'. Fear of course also comes into it.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Just an observation from a "lurker": Not having a S/L is in the opinion of many the equivalent of 'jumping' in front of the bus. To avoid catastophic loss from an event like 9/11; why not look at the chart in post #622 and take note of the max drawdown in this method? Double that value and use it a 'worst-case-scenario' S/L. If this system ever generated that large a drawdown, you are probably in deep trouble anyway. Otherwise you have some protection for your account without unduly restricting the performance of this method with a S/L that is too tight. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
a) I believe with a too small s/l, the broker(s) can and do go pip-hunting. In my early days, I had a s/l of +-20 pips. In demo my strategies always worked really well, the minute I went live I lost serious money. As soon as I started trading with no s/l, or a large one (100-150 pips), no more pip-hunting b) do you mean to say that no s/l tempts fate? Hmmm, can't say I agree with that, nor the jumping principle. what will be, will be. c) if a s/l, then why based on #622? why not on some other 'bad' experience, like 9/11 (1500 pips and you say multiply by 2), or an average of wrong-direction price jumps after news, or.... then you may as well forget the s/l, and live with a cleaned-out account. BTW, that is a s/l anyway of sorts - because you would be drawing winnings out of the account, the worst-case is you would loose what is currently in there, if the bus ever came around

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Yesterday reaping. Took wrong position on EU, but it held in a strong position, entered too early when I saw a red candle appeared.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
I've got 22 wins in a row now. I'm on vacation now, looking in every day or two on the "ATM" chugging away day and night. I'm starting to reconcile the drawdowns and lack of stops. It is rare that the market moves 100's of pips in one direction. It happens, but not often. Once I get back to study I will complete the steps I set down in an earlier post. I tried a couple trades with the strategy I mentioned, but lost. Stops too close.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
I have to admt I was very excited about this method in the beginning. Unfortunately what I've found is that forward testing results are not positive due to the profit taking suggested. Anyone can create a method for good entries but ultimately it's the profit or exit method that has to be worked out. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
43 wins straight, 12 pips each = 516 DD on current trades = 524

--- 帖子 #633 ---
If anybody needs to know where to get this EA just PM me and I will tell you. Still getting great results looking at scalping 12 pips. This is my little ATM machine! Good pips!

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I just saw this statement posted at another Forum. Looks like the 4.set file I requested from Steinitz coded for me got around and is working really well. I hope he doesn't mind but I copied it and posted it here. Maybe I should charge Don for giving him the idea to grab 12+ pips this way! LOL George

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Im sure Don wont mind at all, and Im sure your being well rewarded for your efforts

--- 帖子 #636 ---
The only reward I've gotten from all this is being lucky enough to find this EA. People who know me understand that I like to help new traders and once a while I get back ideas for new methods, it's a two-way street. Happy hunting! George

What's up with this thread? This is sounding a bit like a big commercial. Is there anything more to say about a method? Perhaps at the least we should put this in the lounge, as there is really not anything new or anything other than a EA for sale here...

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Yep, I like sharing when something is really hot. Call it a commercial if you like. And there will be lots more to be said once 2.4 gets released.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
yeah jones i think your right this one belongs in the recycle bin...its a commercial system and steinze wore out his welcome a long time ago. the other HAS threads were moved, i must have missed this one. instead of going to the bin, i am just going to close it. sorry to those who are following this thread.... forex-tsd.com is the home of HAS, so if anyone wants further info please go there.
