Hi dear traders, I've created and optimized this method and I tested it till 2008 and results are fine. It's a very easy method, using daily high/low for entry, and fibonacci for TPs and SLs. Very simple. Before introducing the method, I should aware you that you should absoloutly test it yourself before using it for your real account. Use proper money management to stay in the game and don't overtrade. I don't know that there is similar system on the net or not. I developed this method with the help of one of my clients. Developing and optimizing the strategy took more than 200 hours of team work. I will update this post as needed after I saw what's more questioned. It will become more comprehensive as the time goes by, so you don't need to read the whole thread if you don't like to. Just read this first post and follow the examples. First I will introduce how to trade, then I will tell you the concept behind it. System Properties : Set your fibonacci levels and descriptions like this : Level ----- Description 0 --------- Entry (%$) 1 --------- Entry (%$) -0.5 ------ TP2 (%$) 1.5 ------- TP2 (%$) 0.236 ----- SL (%$) 0.764 ----- SL (%$) 1.25 ------ BE (%$) -0.25 ----- BE (%$) 0.5 ------- BE (%$) Now, adjust fibonacci between high and low of the previous day. As you know previous day will differ on different brokers. 00:00 GMT is recommended, but I use GMT - 1 for my calculations because of my broker time. It's not that different from 00:00 GMT. For better view, you can draw fibo on M15 TF, but it doesn't make any different on how you trade. How To Trade : Now that you know how to detect previous day High and Low, let's get down to how to trade this : We have two types of entries on this method that, First one and Second one. I will discuss the idea behind it after I told you what are they. First Entry : Buy 3 pips above the High of previous day (Entry on fibo lines), SL is 1 pip below "SL" line on you fibonacci tool. We have 2 TPs. One is when price reaches "BE" line above the high of the previous day (1.25 fibonacci or -0.25 fibo, depends how you draw the fibo.), then you should close half and put your SL at BE (Bring your SL on your entry point - No risk from here). You second TP is "TP2" line on your fibo tool. Vice versa for short entry. Second Entry : When you enter long ( After entry triggered ), you should place a sell order right where your SL is. SL for your sell order is 1 pip above the previous day high and TP1 (and of course BE (Break Even) Point) is 0.5 on fibo which is shown is "BE" on you fibo between two "SL"s. TP2 is 1 pip above the "SL" for short entry. You must erase the order IF price reaches TP2 . Vice versa for short entry. ** You must cancel all your orders when current day comes to an end and place new orders due to current day's high and low. ** Avoid gaps. It means don't place orders on friday High/Low if you broker slip the entries due to gap. I will place the orders on the first trading hours of the new week for monday if the gap didn't break the high or low, not on friday night. If it's broken, then there is no orders for me on monday. ** I will not trade if the range is above 170 in previous day because of overbought and oversold issues. ** If you have sunday on you chart, combine sunday and monday. It means if sunday have a lower low than monday's low, then the low for setting orders for tuesday will be sunday's low, not monday. Vice versa for highs. ** If your trades continues to next day, don't change anything. Stick to last day's strategy, and also place new day's order along with your open positions. ** It is prefered not to enter "Second Entries" after US session You may be confused. It's not that hard. I've wrote a program with visual basic for entries. First set your fibo levels, then run the program and check First and Second entries. The spread on EU is 2 on the program. I will make some changes so it can work with variable spreads . Few examples from recent trades are shown below. Useful Posts : Post #2 Post #48 Post #109 Post #542 The Idea behind it : As you may know, Daily High and Low plays an important role on technical analysis for short-term and medium-term traders. So break of this levels may reach targets. But if the price didn't reach final TP (TP2), then we can consider a false break and reverse our position even if price reaches BE point after breaking the previous day's high or low. But if price reaches TP2, then we will consider it a true break, that's why I told you to remove your "Second Entry" order when price reaches TP2, no matter that you are in the trade or not. Pros and Cons : Pros : ** No need to be high skilled trader to understand and trade this method. ** Maximum of 7% drawdown from 2011 till now and happend just once. ** When price reaches TP2, your profit covers a little more that 1 loss. (Sharpe Ratio &gt; 1) ** You can personalize TPs to fit you own personality. ** Very clear method. No self-judgement involved. ** Easy backtest. ** You have one trade per day in average, so if you're greedy in taking trades, you'll be satisfied. Cons: ** Limited Profit in main form. ** May forgot to place "Second Entry" orders is not at pc. (Will be solved with an EA) ** Gaps (More smaller the gap your broker provides, the better the results.) Last Words : ** Like any other method that works, it's not a "guru". You will take losses too. It has some pros and some cons like any other method. It's yours to tell which method to trade. Averagely it will produce between 3% to 4% return on every month with 1% risk on every trade. ** Trade management is a skill that you should learn through experience and lots of trading. Do not change anything of the main method if you're not skilled enough (trading less than 2-3 years). Stick to main system if you're not a pro when trading live. Do anything you like on demo, but do not come to conclusion on few trades. Any particular way of trade management should be tested in at least hundreds of trades. ** Market is alive, and it's behaviour changes through time, because people approach to market changes. So there might be a little update now and then to adjust the method to latest behaviour of the market. It will not happen very often, even it could be solid through years. Don't get me wrong, the method stands solid. By "change" I mean small things, like changing 170 pips for range limit to 200 or higher for more volatile years or taking a greater TP2 if market tends to move more trendish and etc. It's not that big a deal, but if you follow the thread, or even this post, I'll include every update for it. ** I Only use this on EU, the most technical pair. ** There is something else which I think it's important if you guys know. If you don't bring your SL to BE at 1.25, your results will be better. But high profit is not the only case. When I want to design a strategy, I have in mind three things instead of two. 1) Winrate , 2) Sharpe Ratio, 3) Losing Streak. If you take partial profit at TP1 and bring SL to BE, the worst case that could happen to you will decrease alot. So you can risk more and from this way, you can increase your income, and you will feel much more comfortable if the system produce more income, even if it's smaller. But as I said you can raise your income by increasing the risk for every trade. Risks higher that 2% is not recommended. ** The important point is you can personalize the method to fit your personallity, but beware of the main concepts and don't change it too much. For example you can trail for TP2 in anyway you like or change your partial closure management. I recommend that you don't widen you SL. It's better to make change on TPs if you like. But this settings is how I use it. ** Again, backtest it yourself at least for 1 year before using it on real. Demo trade first for at least few weeks. Don't rush. ** You can easily create an EA for this. Share it if you like. ** I recommend using this only on EU, except you find something better on other pairs. Using on multi pairs will enlarge your losing streak and levels is not optimized on other pairs, because different pairs have different attitude, but the main idea behind the strategy remains solid. ** Any good thoughts or updates or ideas are highly appreciated and will be placed in this post to make more out of the main idea. Have fun and trade safe Regards, Basber

Last week's trades and comments : Results : TP1 : 2 Both TPs : 1 SL : 0 Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #3 ---
interested .. dialy high low on yesterday price ?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I'm a fan of clear charts for this ... here's today chart. Two different Senarios : Trading with GMT-1 (As I Do. It may change. like I said it's because of timing in my country. 00:00GMT is recommended) : SL would've been hit for first short entry, TP1 would've been hit for second entry. rest closed at BE. Trading with 00:00 GMT as the beginning of the day. No trades till now. Results for previous week remains the same. As I said, it differs a little because trading volume and volatility is usually thin in those hours.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Another thing I might add here ... As I said in "Pros" in first post, you don't need any other tools like pivots, MAs, trend, etc. This system is based on Minor S&amp;R zones. There is one filter that I use to have better results that I may discuss later. It's a little bit complicated. It's a combinations of PinBar (James Thread) and volume. It's not that important, and of course it has nothing to do here. I brought it up to say that only one thing beside the main method is what I use to filter, nothing more, and it's not crucial at all. It's better to keep it simple for general understanding. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #7 ---
ok.. i'm a fan of IRAN inshaallah could go there.. if dont bother.. please edit this 7 may chart.. for entry

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I love my country, but really hate this government ... Anyway, If you have sunday on you chart, combine sunday and monday. It means if sunday have a lower low than monday's low, then the low for setting orders for tuesday will be sunday's low, not monday. P.S. : The Low you mentioned is 4:45 of may 7th ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #9 ---
will you post some trade tomorrow ?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I will manage to post trades of every week with comments and result at the end of the week. I will post every day's trade pic if there was any question ... The system is so simple that posting trades every day is not necessary. Regards, Basber

,if work , we dont need to wacth CNBC for news , and dont care what ever Bernake said

Test it yourself. You can backtest 1 year in a day if your backtest speed is normal. I tested 4 years in one day. I use excel to maximize accuracy and then check manually for new ideas to make it better. But developing the strategy itself took more than 200 hours of team work.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
how about this chart, is it valid ?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Here is InterbankFX , a GMT time based broker. As you can see, no entry till now. Price didn't reach 3 pips below previous low. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Press F8 while on chart (Or right click, then choose Properties), on "Common" tab, turn on the "Show Period Separator". Then on previous day, connect high and low with fibo. Notice that your broker is better be GMT time zoned. The low is 1.28145 if you consider 00:00 GMT as beginning of trading day. It's on Interbank. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #16 ---
i did , i got 1.28152 now

--- 帖子 #17 ---
If you draw your fibo exactly from high to low, fibo will automatically adjust beginning and the end of the fibo exactly on bar high (for high) and low (for low). notice the yellow circle I drew. I dunno the better way to express this. I hope you understand what I meant to say. By the way, your chart looks ok. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #18 ---
TP1 hit, SL @ BE from here ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #19 ---
in strong bearish bias trend , everyday could be "low daily" .. , we got that bias in last two weeks

--- 帖子 #20 ---
The mass psychology about trend thinking usually is this : Before beginning the trend, many are waiting because the trend hasn't formed yet, but after if formed (now), many afraid to go with trend because they thought price is exhausted. Anyway, in this method you don't need to have a bias. But you can pesonalize it. I mean someone may be much more comfortable to trail for TPs. In these cases, s/he can manage to trail when the trade is in the general trend favor, and manage to have original TPs when trade is counter trend. Or even take more off the table at first target (TP1). I always believe personalizing a system, after fully understanding it and testing it, is a very wise thing to do. It will let you feel good while trading a method. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Second half closed at Break Even. Buy orders for first entry and buy orders for Second Entry are still placed. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Interesting that you still have your buy orders in place. If the buy order at yesterday's high is triggered, I suppose the sell orders would then be placed. Therefore, your system tries to take advantage of a ranging market as well as a trending market. Very good. I'll be watching with interest. Subscribed. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Frollollc, Welcome Yes, you should place the sell order for "Second Entry" after and if the buy order above the previous day high had executed. Some brokers provide "Activation Orders" which you can set an activation price then it will automatically place the order when buy order in "First Entry" Executed. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thanks for sharing...Subscribed

Welcome Liamg Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I will try to code a EA for this system.it seems good.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Thank you publish the first version, then we will work more on it to make it better. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi Basber, interesting system, keep going! Regards, Giulius

--- 帖子 #29 ---
This looks like a very nice system. Have you ever thought about using it on weekly chart? I just made a small visual backtest and to my mind it might work.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
The Idea is not bad Indrek. It may work. I'll look on to that too. Keep up Participating Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Welcome to the thread Giulius Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I am always short of time, so just in case...Has anybody taken a good look at measuring the range from midnight UK time to 8am UK time and setting up for an entry from there? If not, I will make time Cheers, Paul.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I worked with a similar strategy called London Forex Rush, long time ago. It didn't went well on the long run when I backtested it. But you can do some research and maybe create a sub-system from the main strategy. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Why do you want to use 8 hours range only? Better make it 24 hours from 8 am to 8 am Would be convenient for people who live in Europe and sleep during Asian session.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi, I am confussed on the trade. Today I would have Sold and it would hit my Stop Lose. Now what is my second entry a Buy or another Sell? Do I sell again on the second entry? Ron

--- 帖子 #36 ---
The Idea is to take the breakout of low volume range with the momentum of London open I believe. I like to have a 24 hour range because it's also a minor S&amp;R zones and day traders and every medium-term traders notice these levels. So it will work far better because the idea supporting it is much more stronger than the 8 hour range .. Just my 2 cents though .. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Smaller range means more false entries. Same as with timeframes - smaller timeframe has more noise. That is why I would suggest to test even weekly chart. But not less than 24 hours range.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Comments are on the chart. I hope it is clear .. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Totally agree. Been there, done that .. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Regarding the chart... I personally would delete the second entry after the first one is set to BE. We basically trade the daily breakout and the 'second entry' is just for backup if the initial trade turns against us immediately. But it has no independent value as an entry. At least to my mind.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi, This is my short entry and it would of hit my Stop Loss of 1.2758. Ron

--- 帖子 #42 ---
First I had the same Idea, holding on to second entry if BE (TP1) not reached. But after testing through past years and compared the results, I come to this conclusion that Second Entries will remain till price reaches TP2, not TP1. It's tested well, but you can test it yourself to make sure of what I'm saying. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Price came down to 1.2681 before heading for your SL, Look at the chart. If you're still confused, post your orders on your chart. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I do not think that we need testing results from many years. Important is what has happened during maybe last 6 months or so. Market is changing all the time. Lately it has been almost dead...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
The result got better through the time. 2011 had the best result, yielding more than 4% profit per month, better than the total average of 4 years which was around 2.8% per month (on 1% risk on every trade). Like I mentioned, 200 working hours with a high skilled programer (excel expert) gave me the result I'm sharing. Even in past 6 months, "Second Entry" considering current strategy, produced more profit that "First Entry". Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I may add this : I believe a good system should work fine through at least 5 consecutive years, because market usually change it's behaviour through 4 year time cycle. So 5 years of consecutive positive results covers 2 cycles, one full cycle and one quertered cycle. The thing you mentioned is absoloutly right. The recent properties and style is optimized with the latest movements and latest market behaviour. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Ok, I see. But making 4% per month is not worth the effort, of course... If the system works good then have to increase lots or to let trades run after reaching TP2. Have you tested the possibility to leave the final portion open and trail it somehow?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
If the range remain like this, orders will be like shown below. Second picture is orders for "First Entry" and last picture is orders for "Second Entry". Spread is 2 and is calculated for buy orders, which means the number in the chart for buy orders is 2 pips lower than the numbers in the DBCal software. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #49 ---
4% is a benchmark, you can change your risk, as you mentioned. I'm working on changing TP2 and trail it with the general trend. But I haven't came to solid conclusion yet. I'll be glad to have some ideas on it. It's highly possible to boost the result I presume. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi, Ok. I agree. I see it now. So the first trade made it to TP1 and the second was BE. Thanks. Ron

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Yes, for the first sell entry, half should be closed at TP1 and SL should be changed to entry point (SL @ BE) for the other half. For the buy entry of the "Second Entry", it would straitly go to SL point. So One TP1 and one SL for today. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Basber, Some good programmer will look at this and have it done in no time. I have a Generic Breakout EA, but doesn't have the logic that is required. Ron

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Yes, it's not that hard for someone who can write an EA. Unfortunately I don't know MQL ... What do you mean by "having a logic" ? You meant the EA you have don't have a supportive idea behind it ? (Did I understand right ?!) Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Basber, If you look at A Simple London Breakout, it might be something of value. Ron

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I've tested the EA on 2010 and the results was bad. The thread is not active anymore to check the settings, but with main settings, it gives lots of false breakouts. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #56 ---
' Trading a session breakout and a daily breakout are still different systems that need a bit different approach and research. There are also certain periods of 1-3 hours during a day that can also be traded as breakout. But putting these all together into the same thread would be absolutely confusing. Besides, all other breakout systems already have different threads in different forums.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Two updates. 1:Now there are two indis,one works on XXXjpy pairs and work on all the other pairs. 2:If your broker has a sunday chart(6 days one week),then set weekends to ture.If your broker has no sunday(5 days one week),then set weekends to false. I'm coding the EA and there is still some bugs.I will post it later. I coded a indi for this strategy to make it easier to backtest and trade. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1337256274 There are 6 lines,the two red lines is the low and high of last day,the two golden lines is the frist stop of your frist trade,the green lines is the tp1,the blue lines is the tp2. I use some codes of "10.2 weeklypivots RS" of NB,thanks him. Great thanks to basber who share this. Let's make this tread a great one by wroking together. mahanxiong

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You can usd the indi in any TF lower than D1.And there is no BE line of the 2ed trade(the value of which is (last_high+last_low)/2) because the MT4 allow 8 lines only for each indi. For this indi uses the data of D1 chart,if it doesn't work you can try to open the D1 chart of the symbol you want to trade to get the datas. Have fun.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
i know MQL very well, tell me clearly how your trade then i will write EA as u want

Mahanxiong, Thanks for the help. Ron

say: A:60% to win and winpips:losspips=1:1 and 1lots for 1 pair. B:60% to win and winpips:losspips=1:1 and 0.5lots fo 2 pairs each(say both are major). 1 trade/pair 1 day. For A,he has a 60% chance to win and a 40% chance to loss. For B,he has a 36% chance to win and a 48% to BE and a 16% chance to loss. IF C trade 3 pairs at same time than he has a 21.6% chance to win as much as the win of A,has a 6.4% to lose as much as a lose of A,has a 43.2% chance to win 1/3 as much of a win of A,and has a 28.8% chance to lose 1/3 as much of a lose of A. AS they share the same mathematical expectation(arrage)，I want to be B who trades more pairs with small lots.why? The 1st reason is that the DD is smaller so my boss will give me more money to trade. The 2st reason is that the chance to lose all the money is much less if you trade 3 pairs.(It's not a easy maths problem.But it can be proved using tool of maths) The 3st reason is that for you have a smaller DD you can use bigger lots to trade which means more profits in your blance. It seems good i know.But all of this is based on that you have a 60% or higher chance to win in every pairs you trade.Is that ture?I want to someone to help to backtest to see if this system works in other pairs. thanks.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi, What would happen if the BE point is used if the price gets to be 50% of the TP1 value? Ron

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Then you close one trade and move the SL of the other trade to BE point.At least i think so.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi, i am just saying this to modify. If it gets to the 50% of the movement to the tp1, then move the stops to BE.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Nice job Mahan Is there a way to overlap another indicator to draw the TP1 line for second entry ? Looking forward to test the EA. Let the levels be variables so that we could test other levels for other pairs too. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #67 ---
It's on the first post E, Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #68 ---
The theory is right, but it's not how it is. I've tested it on AU, results was positive, but not as attractive as EU. And tested on UJ and results was not good because the small daily ranges makes spread play an important factor to change the positive results into negative. Maybe we can change the levels and have a good results. More importantly, your calculations was right if you have 3 methods with all 60% win rate (In first paragraph I discussed why it's not the same on all pairs. EU is the most technical one) and the other important thing is they should have independent results with one another to create what you came to. But the thing is they are depended to one each other, it's because usually when a break occur for EU, AU or GU or UCHF or etc. can have the same break, but because EU has the best outcome, trading on different pairs will bring down the win chance. In conclusion, your theory can't work because it will bring down the winrate, because all of them don't have the same winrate and they are not as high as EU. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #69 ---
It's very small, so it will not give the trade to breathe. then we will have a lot of BEs and we may miss the move very often and it will decrease the profit. The level I put (1.25) was a good place because it's not that far so the price may easily reach it, and it's not that close so the trade will not break even most of the time. There is something else which I think it's important if you guys know. If you don't bring your SL to BE at 1.25, your results will be better. But high profit is not the only case. When I want to design a strategy, I have in mind three things instead of two. 1) Winrate , 2) Sharpe Ratio, 3) Losing Streak. If you take partial profit at TP1 and bring SL to BE, the worst case that could happen to you will decrease alot. So you can risk more and from this way, you can increase your income, and you will feel much more comfortable if the system produce more income, even if it's smaller. But as I said you can raise your income by increasing the risk for every trade. Risks higher that 2% is not recommended. Regards, Basber

First sell order executed, now it's time to place buy for "Second Entry". Let the market decide the rest. P.S. : Ignore the volume indicator and vertical lines. Just the fibo for now. Regards, Basber

i always take short-cut to the last post. That why...

No problem E. Let me know if you need something else. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yeah,I backtest it a little and find the same thing. The stuff of the dependence is not a problem.You can go to http://www.forexticket.co.uk/en/tools/01-01-correlation to choice 2-3 pairs that are not in high correlation. But the win rate is really is problem.Basicly,the majors are all in a high rate of correlation for they are all xxxVSusd,so i try EU and a high liquility cross as GJ,the reasult is fine but not very good. But still i like to trade 2 or 3 pairs together.I will study more about this. HF mahanxiong

hi etrade,will you be so kind to code the EA? For i'm busying with my coming exam,if you are going to code it then I will be able to have time to goover my class.thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Mahan, I recommend you wait for an EA to be created with variable fibo levels. Then we can easily check other levels too. Different pairs have different move patterns. SL is optimized for many pairs, but we should work on TPs for different pairs that is much more easier with an EA. Gold and oil also can be candidates too. But it should be tested well. With same levels, EU is the best. You must change levels and optimize it and without an EA, it takes a lot of time. Maybe even more than 100 hours. Regards, Basber

Take your time Mahan, Regards, Basber

Hi packgreen I will backtest it and update... I know there are lots of bugs there.I'm really busy this days and i don't have lots of time to code. Update will come hours later. mahanxiong

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thank you,iwjw,i will change them. any error else?

Hi, I wish I could help, but I know very little. Ron

--- 帖子 #96 ---
nothing I'm currently aware of but didn't test the ea so far until the loops are corrected maybe you can arrange that the latest version of the ea can be found as attachment in post #1

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I'm waiting for the edited version. I'll put the EA on the first post when it's well tested. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Anyhow i changed a little and now it works better. The 2nd trade is still not able to open.may be something about the "lose" in the code is wrong.Could anyone help to change it? Sorry for the time problem again. BTW,the ea only open one gruop of trades,say it open long as 1st trade then TP,it will not trade this day anymore. thanks mahanxiong

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Try it again It now works for me in backtest. mahanxiong

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I forgot to reset the counter... Now it doesn't stop.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Basber thx for the strategy .... since you have everything programmed into excel can you tell us the average gain p.m and the max dd for the last year at 2% risk per trade and 5% risk per trade

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi, I just ran the backtest since 1/1/12. It was in the Red, but I hope the second TP will get it out of the Red. Ron

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I should say the 'second trade'. Ron

--- 帖子 #105 ---
It will, usually they cover each other, but it shouldn't be red. Did you do all managements due to main strategy ? for example bringing SL @ BE, or avoiding gaps, letting trades run into tommarow and etc ? I'll test the EA tommarow. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I said it in the first post. Average 3 to 4 percent per 1% risk. multiply by 2 for 2% and 5 for 5% risk per trade. Risk over 2% is not recommended. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I checked it, not throughly, but I found some things that needs to change. Check the trades manually till the EA is Completely out of bugs. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Few things that I came to till now : -- The maximum valid range is 170, not 120. Change the default to 170. -- Another thing is there are many days that it didn't take the trade (First pic), although the range is valid. It happens alot. -- Sometimes it did not change the SL to BE (Second picture) -- Important : Trading volume should not be solid. The EA must have the risk and account balance as income, and it should calculate the volume itself. It have a very significant influence on the results. -- It takes only one trade (first entries) in every day. If it's possible please put a deadline for orders to be executed, I may change some details, and it's needed to be there. For example it may be better not to enter the trade if it's after US session. -- The spread should be in "inputs" -- It occured that EA just placed sell orders. Dunno why ! (Third picture) -- Price opened in the range of previous day after gap, but orders didn't placed. (4th Pic) After all, you did a real good job. Thanks alot Keep up the good work Regards, Basber

Great way to orient your trades to the market, Basber. I think this could be a very helpful approach for anyone who is struggling to find success as a trader. It epitomizes the "Keep It Simple" rule. I'll be following along ... I wish you the best with your thread. God Bless, my friend, -DD

--- 帖子 #112 ---
It was very nice to see you here old friend. Thanks for stoping by Best Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi Basber when SL hit what is the next step do u put again a new order ?

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I'll answer you and Baser should correct me if wrong. If you SL is hit then you reverse your order and make your TP1 is the first Fibo line in your way, where you should close half of your position, and make TP2 the second line.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Ok, did you bactest this strategy? You said yes. Is it possible to see balance sheet in demo?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Yes, you place the orders right when you enter the first trade. For example when the low of the previous day broke, your first sell will be executed. Orders for buy for "Second Entry" should be placed right away, after the execution of sell order, in this example. When SL hit, you should be in second order, too late to place the orders. In other words, you must reverse your position (your sell hit SL, then you'll buy right away). But after the SL hit for sell order, you shouldn't place the sell for first entry again. Every order must execute once. After execution, it will not be placed again. Hope it was clear. Review the examples. Ask if there is still problem. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #117 ---
thanks Basber for your answer. i think there is also a weak point in the system. the system is based on previous day range and as we know after a small day range we will have a good run that we could miss it as the target will be small.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
As I mentioned before, the best part to parsonalize is working on TPs, specially TP2. I prefer trailing. But Profit management is a very hard concept to grasp. So I provided the basic version to be as simple as possible. I agree, it's a weak part, but traders must optimize this part themselves, because it depends how you feel about your trade management. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Second TP for the buy from last week also hit TP2. Another bought opened at the break of the high of the last friday. So in result, we have on TP2 for today and one open position. Orders for sell in "Second Entry" must've been placed till now. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi Basber Thanks for sharing all your hard work, this strategy looks solid. I am in the process of back testing it myself and during the period I am looking at the days after inside days seem to have a very high win rate. So I was wondering if you already looked at IB days, NR4/7 etc. concept within this strategy while you were designing it? I think it might produce somewhat lower average months but maybe smooth out the equity curve. Anyone else have any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Yes, you're absoloutly right. I didn't bring it up to keep it as simple as possible. Take the main idea from the method, then personalize it to fit your personality and your knowledge. You can of course change TPs to take the most out of market. Trade management is a very hard concept, and unfortunately there no only "one way". I presented the basic method. Don't change everything. I suggest that you and anyone else work on TP2 if you want to change it. let the rest be as it is. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Good observation, If with further testing it is proven that what you have stated increases the probability of the wins for this system then to counteract the lower average monthly returns you could just take a bigger risk since the probability is higher.... Just a suggestion.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
When someone wants to increase his/her risk, s/he must notice his/her maximum drawdown very very carefully. Many people asked "when you net 20% profit per season with less than 1% risk on every trade, why don't you double your risk to double your income ?" The answer is a little complicated for new traders, but for whom who had more than 5 years of experience in this business, it's obvious. Trading is mostly a battle of mind. The most important skills in trading concludes in managing your emotions. In this example, big drawdowns make you suffer a psychological burden, and many things came by next that may damage your account. My account is huge, so no need for high risks and income is sufficient. I myself always suggest risks lower than even 1% for traders. Risk around 2% is okay if you're trading on higher timeframes, such as daily and you don't do more than 1-2 trades per week. When you increase your risk, many other things (mostly phychological matters) may come into play that you may not handle well. It's not a mathematical formula, it's human nature and no one can eliminate it. More experienced traders just can handle it, not eliminating their weaknesses. Just my 2 cents though ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Thanks Guys I just finished backtesting May to end 2nd week December 2011 on GMT candles. The system performs so well during that time that there's no advantage to be gained by only trading after the inside days. I got an average monthly win (risking 1%) of 6.4% and only 1 losing month (-0.7%) and a max drawdown of -3.9% (and that was during a winning month). What does look even better, as Basber suggests, is something like being more ambitious with the TP2 targets after the inside days, especially where the first trade fails or only makes TP1, then reverses right out the other side. The earlier in the London session the reversal happens, the better. What a fine strategy. Basber, this is a work of art.

Hi Basber, Chris from South Africa here, I'm relatively new to forex trading. Now I've been wondering what brokerage/trading software to use that allows "trigger" orders (if that's what it's called?) I've been trading on a dummy MT5 account and have had pretty good success over the first 2 months of trading. I found your system, started reading the thread and it looks really great! Not sure if you're allowed naming brokers etc on the thread? But any help in any regard to the types of orders to be placed for the SL fib lines would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Chris

--- 帖子 #128 ---
It doesn't matter Chris. You can use whatever broker you want. There are many websites and forums even here discussing pros and cons for different brokers. I'm not familier with all of them, so suggesting one is not what I like to do. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hello, is anyone activly testing the EA? is it working correctly? what about the secondary trades? Thanks

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi All I did a back test of the last 4 years and thought I would share the data here (attached), comparing last year with last 4 years. No trades on UK public holidays or last 2 weeks of December. My analysis is, watch out if you get 3 consecutive losing months or a draw down bigger than 10 units of risk at any time. I can't claim every trade in the back test as 100% accurate but it should be accurate enough to give a big picture. Even with slippage and bad execution, this system still has a good expectancy. But will be pretty hard to sleep without an EA!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Thank you for the results Lemna

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi lemna, Could you please place your back test result for last 4 year in format: TP1 – x; TP2 – y; SL – z; Like Basber did in his post 109. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Sure, over 4 years it was like this: TP1 - 320 TP2 -283 SL - 355 plus a handful of trades at close Friday that were somewhere in between. I also took trades if Sunday gap came down to entry within an hour.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
here is the fibo indi depends on high-low its draws...

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thanks Lemna - How do you run the tests? any EA? I have some tweaks that I wish to apply and see if we can improve things.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I had a look today in the EA, it places two orders in the previous day low and high bur that's all it does. There is no OCO, no secondary trades and no SL to BE. Anyone maybe using a different ea? Thanks

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi Wala. d, Believe it or not, I did a manual backtest with forex tester. Time consuming but at least this gives you a feel for a strategy that you dont get from EA testing. I'm sure there were a few errors but over such a large sample I am confident the statistics I have are correct proportionately. I have no EA and am trading it manually from GMT using alerts to my phone. I did not look in detail at whether trades during one session had better or worse results (e.g.. Asian session). But during the manual process I did not get a feeling that time was much of a factor. I might be wrong. So I can't help with programming but would be very interested to hear your ideas for tweaks (or ideas anyone else has) and to give my opinion based upon what I saw already. My thoughts are towards looking for big TP2 profits at reversals after NR4 inside days or NR7 days where price has hit long term S/R ideally with Fib confluence. Sometimes though, these days can be complete disasters, so I wouldn't choose them blindly.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I went live with this last Friday. Had a sell loss in the Asian session, then a buy reversal loss I think just at the end of the Asian session. Around NY open there was a buy that reached TP1, and then a buy reversal that reached TP1 but came just 1 pip short (with my broker) of TP2 then got stopped out for BE. To anyone else trading it hope you made that TP2! No trades for me today or tomorrow as London holiday.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
london ,newyork session are a profitable one.i dont trade asian session.if someone like to trade asia then trade audusd,nzdusd.london,newyork is the price drivers pair trends very well.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
here is the short call

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Appreciated Lemna. I am presently investigating/testing the following improvement/variation: * Working on the Weekly timeframe instead of the daily. In other words, the low and high of the week. * Instead of opening 2 lots. I open one lot only. Theoretically, this should lead to better results as the RR will be 1:2 instead of being 2:3 as proposed in this thread.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Nice job Lemna. I may share one of my other strategies in future. I use some of it basics to take more money out of this method, but the idea of tracking TP2 for higher profits is very valid. You can have 2 approaches : 1) Putting SL to BE after TP1 and trail for TP2 with a large solid target. 2) Leave the SL at it's place if you're very selective about "when" to go for bigger profits. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #143 ---
People, if you want to make money, you should do exactly what Lemna did. Testing any method manually will give you confidence in system, but more importantly is you can inject your ideas into it. If you observe hundreds of entries, you may see some patterns that may help you to increase your edge. Even if you saw many traders put the same results, you yourselves should test it yourself. Well done Lemna Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Levels are not the same as it is on the strategy. And I don't find anywhere to change it. Regards, Basber

Thanks Basber Yesterday had a long TP1, didn't reach TP2 hit BE this morning. Just entered a long breakout from yesterday's high. Guys, will post more here as I do more research, let's see what ideas we can come up with.

hello basber how u handle the trade while big impact news.you gave a edge over fibo numbers .i am trading this in eurusd,euryen,gbpusd,gbpyen.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I usually remove the orders on Non-Farm days. I don't mind the other news. Usually traders think technical analysis and fundamental analysis are two different things, but it's not. How is it possible for technical analysis to work if it's against the fundamentals ?! It's the same, the approach for analysing is different. For example when you saw Bernanke speach have an impact on dollor, it may break the previous day's low or high and it may reach the targets. If it fails to reach the targets and hit SL, then you will understand that it wasn't so important. These kind of information usually show themselves after price moves. For example if you read Bloomberg currency news, you'll see there is always a fundamental explanation for every move and it may not be the same. Last year along with Euro Crisis, gold was treated as a safe heaven, but now it's not. Why is that ?! It's not about understanding the "why". It's about "how" we can trade along with the market and be profitable. I just expanded a little why I believe that both analysis are the same in basics. The appearance differs alot, but the man concept is the same, that's why I don't mind news. But in some news like NFP, there are lots of false break outs which hunts many trader's SLs. So I prefer to just watch the market. Slippage, Spread widening, false breaks are the reasons I will not trade NFP days and also days that atracts too many attention. For example GDP of USA in last year I believe. It depends, but it's not big a deal. By the way, I didn't get what I expected on other pairs with this method, so instead of trading couple of pairs, I rather to increase my risk and put it only on EU. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #152 ---
eurusd long breakout reached tp1 trade at be will bernanke push it up to tp2?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Bernanke stops me out for the 3 millionth time

--- 帖子 #154 ---
It happens Lemna. You can set a trailing distance stop for these times. I don't, because I don't mind these things when it comes to this method, but it's one of the ways to protect profits during heavy news. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #155 ---
True, the losses are just little sacrifices. I have faith. Looks like today will be very short range (NR7) so tomorrow could be good.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I like the short entry, so I'll set the TP2 for the sell around 1.23xx area. Of course I'll bring SL @ BE and take partial profit @ TP1. Note for traders : Trade management is a skill that you should learn through experience and lots of trading. Do not change anything of the main method if you're not skilled enough (trading less than 2-3 years). Stick to main system if you're not a pro when trading live. Do anything you like on demo, but do not come to conclusion on few trades. Any particular way of trade management should be tested in at least hundreds of trades. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Range above 170 pips for yesterday, so no orders for today. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #158 ---
This system is really great .... Someone please make an EA now.... -)

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I JUST wrote an EA for this. It's probably full of bugs, and won't be ready to trade live for a while. Still, if any of you would mind helping me test this on demos, I'm sure I can sniff those bugs out much faster. inputs: maxrange : maximum daily range that we will trade. default : 1700(170 pips) lots : size of lots to trade. If you want to trade 1 lot, please put in 0.5 as this EA opens 2 orders. magicnumber : self explanatory. make sure it's unique. daystart : this is the hour showing on your broker at 0GMT. buffer : default is 30. This is the distance from the high/low you want to place your pending order. decimal : number of decimal places your broker uses for EURUSD. To use: just place on any eurusd chart. any time frame should work. This EA will not trade on mondays. To place order for monday, press f3 to bring up global variables. change the "trading on" to 1, and it will place the trade for you. Please do this only if you know what you're doing, and only do this once to avoid duplicate trades. final warning: This EA is FAR from mature, and should only be used on demos. I coded this up during my lunch break, and have done extremely limited testing on it. Chances of it working exactly as it should are extremely low. pls pm me if you find anything wrong. I expect to be flooded=)

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks Deathbait, I will check it out. I don't know much about EAs. Are you hoping to improve it eventually so it position sizes automatically?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Position sizing is easy to do. I'm more concerned about the EA following the rules properly.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Great, I'll set it up tonight and report back soon.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Don't have time to go through the code to fix it now, but here's the current TODO list 1) fix lot sizing. Lemma's right, that's just lazy/sloppy 2) slight error in boxing the day's high/low. Shift error 3) code doesn't take into account bars generated over weekend. Overall, Monday trading is iffy. That's why its disabled. Suspect even the manual order placing via global variable is very wrong. 4) close orders on Friday before close. Need confirmation on whether to let it ride the weekend. Currently unsure of basber's stance on this point. 5) create array to track trades that carry over next day. Need clarification with what to do with them. For eg, if tp 1 is hit on day 2, do I still move sl to be, or just exit whole trade? Will see what I can do about these things tommorrow. In meantime, if bashed can chime in on points 4 and 5, it would be very helpful.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Dear All, Some time ago I posted a back test which Basber linked to on the front page. Please accept my sincere apologies, but I just found that there was an error in the excel I used that inflated the size of the winning trades. Therefore, although my revised test shows the system has still been profitable over the last 4 years, the profitability, expectancy, % of winning months etc. are all significantly less than as stated in the backtest I posted. I have calculated some revised numbers but I realised I also made another error. Basber said that when TP2 is hit, you cancel the reversal trade. What I had not thought through about this is, suppose you make BE on the breakout trade, but then the price goes back to hit TP2. It is now my understanding that you cancel the reversal trade, even though you did not actually get that TP2. I realised this today when it happened. I am not going to manually go through 4 years of data again to find the days where this happened. If anyone wants to tell me the days when this happened, I will happily publish an amended back test. Once again, I apologise, though I think the system has made money since I published the back test.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
fixed some stuff: //v0.11 changelog //1)added trading_in_progress to track open trades and disable manage_orders() when no more trades are pending/open //2)fixed shift error in calculating previous day high/low //3)fixed lot sizing //4)fixed 2nd entry orders so they don't duplicate //TODO: //-monday orders //-close trades on friday close //-track orders that carry over to next day If any of you tried the demo today, you will no doubt see that the EA tries to delete orders that don't make sense, and duplicate some. Hopefully this has been fixed. You can test the demo by setting the daystart variable to the current hour and let it start taking orders immediately. That's what I've been doing, but I don't really have much time to test it(at work lol). What this will do is, the EA will take the current hour as the start of the day, and bracket out the high and low of last 24 hours, and take trades from there.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
some of you must be puzzled why it does wacky stuff when you're putting it on your charts. Short answer is, I goofed, and it only worked on 1H timeframe. Fixed that, now it draws a box for good measure. V0.12 changelog 1) added box for ease of visual confirmation of prev 24 hour high/Low 2) fixed bug so now it can be used in any time frame

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Your effort is immensely appreciated and I am keeping an eye on your EA.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
basber, can you confirm for me 2 rules in your system? 1) do we close all trades at end of friday? 2) when our first entry hits(for eg, buy), do we remove the opposite first entry(the sell)?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi DB, Thank you for putting your time into this. I will test the EA ASAP. About your questions, the answer to both is "no". But sometimes I remove the orders when the volume goes very thin after US session, but in the basic form of this strategy, you should keep the orders till the next day. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #170 ---
No worries Lemna, Is it possible that you share the results so that I could put it in first post so others could use it ? I want someone else test it too, instead of just my comments on results ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Few things till now : 1) Second Entries did not applied. 2) After TP1 hit, SL should be placed at openning price (SL @ BE) 3) Is it possible that if price opened within the high and low of friday, then orders on monday will be placed ? I mean is it possible for the software to detect the gap ? (I think it's possible) 4) Some errors are in the picture. 5) Does it adjust the volume of trade to SL and %Risk or it still trade with consistant volume ? I still didn't check the levels. I will soon. Thanks again. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #172 ---
haha you're right you found some errors before i could publish the new code to cover my ass=) here it is: V0.13 changelog 1) using experimental trade context catches from steve to send orders to avoid trade context errors when placing trades using multiple pairs with this EA 2) changed global var name to be more intuitive. 3) fixed range bug 4) fixed high low bug introduced in v0.12 5) changed rules to follow basber's clarification Alot of the bugs have been silly and a direct result of the rushed work yesterday. Hopefully from here on out, only the really weird ones are discovered.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
No worries DB, your work is appreciated. It'll become bug free soon In version 0.13 orders are not placed right. I think you changed some lines in codes in wrong way. Still no second entries, no changing SL to BE , constant volume , ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #174 ---
you are absolutely correct sir. I changed the way some modifies are made and now i've broken what worked. Working on it

--- 帖子 #176 ---
v0.14 changelog 1) removed previous day rectangle that was used for testing and left in unintentionally 2) fixed major bug where orders are cancelled right after they are placed 3) fixed(hopefully) moving stoploss to BE after TP1 hits crossing my fingers!

many, MANY irritating bugs v0.15 changelog -fixed various extremely annoying bugs. the second entry orders work now, basber. I didn't even notice it wasn't entering. Thanks for pointing it out.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi Basber, First many thanks for your system. I've got 2 quick questions. If a trade (eg buy) is still open at the end of the day: 1. Do you maintain the first entry sell order valid for the next day. My understanding is no. 2. Do you maintain the second entry order for the next day if TP2 has not been hit ? My understanding is yes. Many thanks for your clarifications.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hello Phik, When you have a open position that goes through next day, your approach to setting next day's orders will not change. So you put first entry sell order even if you have bought the pair in previous day and it goes to next day. Even you sometimes have two open positions together like now. A buy from previous day is still open and another buy opened today when previous day's high broke. All unexecuted orders will be removed at the end of the day, including second entry's order, even if the trade goes to next day. For example I placed today's second entry's order now, not last day's second entry's order. I hope it was clear. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Good job DB, it improved alot. I've tested it through 1 month and here are some bugs. But as I mentioned, it far more better that version 0.14. It still trades with constant volume ... Instead of taking "lotsize" as an input, EA should recieve "Percentage of Risk" and "Balance" as an input and then calculate the volume itself. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Best IDEA, Thanks

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I see you're testing on 15 min charts. I made major changes to the way it handles different time frames in v0.16. Can you check it again? Time frames other than 1H had some weird stuff happening in v0.15. Could be related. Also, I note that on 3 of your screenshots, the range was above 1700(170 pips). The system filters them out according to your rules on page 1. If you've revised the rule, let me know. I can only replicate the last 2 errors. The one on 8th march looks like it's executed properly. The TP of the previous day just happily coincided with that day. Put it on v0.16 and take another look? The one on 12th march is a direct effect of the system currently not trading on mondays. A position on 9th march was held onto 12th march over the weekend, and the EA don't send any orders on mondays. It's also caused in part by the fact that the EA currently does not track orders that carry over the second day. That will be fixed this weekend, hopefully, together with automating monday trading. Currently wrapping my head around monday trading logic, so if you don't mind clarifying: when monday opens, do we want to bracket friday 0000GMT to sunday 2359GMT? for eg, on friday morning just now, we took the high and low of thursday, from 0000GMT to 2359GMT. When monday opens, logically, we should be taking friday 0000GMT to 2359GMT. Should I add in the few odd bars from sunday as well? Experience tells me that the gaps happen on the sunday bars, and if we take the sunday bars into account, there should be no gaps on entries. Since you talked about gaps, AND taking the sunday bars into consideration, I'm a little confused. In the meantime, here's v0.16. The automatic risk sizing is a very basic formula, and due the number of rounding offs this strategy requires, isn't very exact. But it definately places lots within the ballpark. I would say 2% lotsize error either way. Still possible I may have made a mistake here, so play with it. v0.16 changelog 1) added primitive lot sizing 2) made some changes in time structure so it's more friendly on multiple timeframes. 3) now draws previous day box when EA opens. Previously waited for new day before drawing box and initialising values 4) caught minor error in SL levels

Many thanks for your answers Basber ! I just wonder how you manage you trade during the night....! This EA will us all sleep better....LOL !

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I see you're testing on 15 min charts. I made major changes to the way it handles different time frames in v0.16. Can you check it again? Time frames other than 1H had some weird stuff happening in v0.15. Could be related. Will do soon. Also, I note that on 3 of your screenshots, the range was above 1700(170 pips). The system filters them out according to your rules on page 1. If you've revised the rule, let me know. LOL ! I didn't note it !! Yes you're right. It's also caused in part by the fact that the EA currently does not track orders that carry over the second day. That will be fixed this weekend, hopefully, together with automating monday trading. So it can be done ... I'm glad when monday opens, do we want to bracket friday 0000GMT to sunday 2359GMT? for eg, on friday morning just now, we took the high and low of thursday, from 0000GMT to 2359GMT. When monday opens, logically, we should be taking friday 0000GMT to 2359GMT. Should I add in the few odd bars from sunday as well? Sunday and monday should be recognized as one day. Is it possible ? In the meantime, here's v0.16. The automatic risk sizing is a very basic formula, and due the number of rounding offs this strategy requires, isn't very exact. But it definately places lots within the ballpark. I would say 2% lotsize error either way. Still possible I may have made a mistake here, so play with it. I'll take a look. 2% is acceptable. Thanks again DB. Looking forward to next version. I'll test more and tell you the result. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #189 ---
It'll make it much more easier, but now I'll place the orders when I want to go so sleep, I'll set an alert to actuate when my orders execute, then I wake up and place the second entry's orders. Not a very pleasant way, but it's the only way to do it. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Sometimes there are 4 entries in one day as below : 1) First sell or buy (Consider buy for example) 2) If the first entry didn't hit TP2, and reverses, it'll execute orders for second entry. Sell in the example above. 3) Break of the other side. In this example break of the low of the previous day which will execute the sell order for first entry. 4) Price reverses again and catch the buy order for second entry. The EA execute first 3 ones right, but it don't execute the 4th one. Edit : It don't bring SL to BE for second entry when TP1 hit. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #191 ---
ok so treat sundays as part of mondays so does that mean monday's trade based on friday's high/lows should be placed on sunday when broker opens for business?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
oh i wasn't aware there was going to be a fourth entry. So am I right in saying we can hit 4 entries a day?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Absoloutly. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Yes, you can have 4 entries in a day. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Good morning and thanks for the thread. I took a swing at this last night and just wanted to verify that I got it right. As usual, my first attempt was a complete failure. Am I right in noting that we got stopped out of our long placed last night (my time) at 1.2640 and also got stopped out of entry 2 placed short at 1.2615.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Also, Do you add spread to your entry and s/l points, in other words when you place a long at 3 pips above entry fib, do you add spread to that. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Spyderman, For me, buy was stopped out but my second entry short is still alive. I entered at 1.2612...

--- 帖子 #198 ---
v0.17 changelog 1) trading on tuesday now takes into account sunday's data together with monday's 2) range bug fixed 3) monday trading enabled 4) added array to store previous day orders when new day begins. stores for a week. v0.18 changelog 1) added ability to manage previous trades carried over

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Basber, what happens if the low of the day happens to be on the last bar, and we're unable to place the sell order. Do we still place the buy on the other side? Or do we treat this like a gap on monday?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi DB, Thank you for the EA your efforts are very much apprecieted . I have one comment as I left the EA to run today, the secondary trade that was placed after the buy was triggered had no TP or SL. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #201 ---
What version of the Ea were u using, and was there a error message in your journal? Were u using it on more than one chart?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Version 15 as it was the latest I could download on thursday night. I had no errors and the EA was running in one chart.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I can confirm that everything pre 0.16 will do wacky stuff on non 1h timeframes. Other than that, I can't really see why it wouldn't place tp and sl. Are u sure there's no error message thrown by the expert? What it does is place an order, then set the tp and sl. There's nothing that should trigger one and not the other

--- 帖子 #204 ---
No worries, I will load the newest version on Monday and I will post any problems if any. The only point I would like to see is if we could also manually change the settings, for example if the tp will be close to a round number I normally tend to set the tp before that and equally if the sl is close to a round number I tend to place it after that point. Thanks

--- 帖子 #205 ---
If you don't mind, I would really appreciate it if you could double check if the expert threw an error. V0.15 should still b throwing some errors even if the trade was placed right. I only changed it recently to remove those errors.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Ok I must have misread this the first time. Let me walk through what v0.17 is supposed to do in this situation, and u tell me if I got it wrong. 1) 0000gmt, place pending orders on previous day high and low 2) buy gets executed, so place buy second entry 3) buy doesn't hit tp2, and comes down to enter second entry(sell) 4) sell is successful and tp2 is achieved, so remove all pending orders. Trading over for the day Am I supposed to keep the original sell orders if tp2 for 2nd entry is reached?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Nobody here anymore? Being looking for 3 days but to my surprise ?? John from Durban

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I'm still interested, but where is Basber...? Is the EA fully finalised...? This system really needs it.....!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi DP, I had version 18 on today and somehow the secondary order got cancelled, see the attached. I closed the platform by mistake and couldn't see any errors when i reopened it. I will have it open for tomorrow. Thanks

--- 帖子 #210 ---
hmm didn't see that happening either. I do have it on for the open 3 hours ago, and everything looks alright so far

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi Basber I trade this way. I have been now for almost two years now. Some currency pairs are obviously better to trade this way then others. I call it my Bar Break strategy. Also have a Bar Cover strategy which utilizes support and resistance as stop losses as opposed to limit buy or sell entries. I trade previous daily support and resistance each night. I set limits 10 pips below support or above resistance. 9:00 pm set limit orders on daily breaks by 9:00 AM trades closed. Stops and take profits at 1:1 R:R. I am constantly recycling new probable entries and exiting trades that are not performing. I believe the recycling process allows for the next days possible bar break as opposed to hoping my initial trade will still run to the take profit. Also this takes risk off the table. I only use the SMA to make sure I am with the herd. It's cool to see your elaborate version of the way i trade. I am sure you may have a slight edge as far as performance per trade due to you using more variables to manage your positions.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
K Minos, check that this is not a hedging policy issue. I entered manually the second entry yesterday and it was not triggered due to hedging beeing prohibited on my ibfx demo account. DP, is the EA working fine now...? By the way, thanks for your great work to have this system automatised.... I need to sleep more LOL !

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I hope it's working fine. Wouldn't use it on live just yet though. Would be nice if you could demo it next to your manual trading to see what performs differently, so i can tweak it.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Ok, will do both so that we can see any discrepancy...

--- 帖子 #215 ---
DP, two quick questions as I don't use EA normally: 1. Will the EA still work if I put my pc off ? 2 The EA did not place any pending order on my platform. Will it enter at market once we reach the entry price ? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I have went through this thread and I have question regarding how you take the trade? Based on Entry 1 for any candle I can go break of low of the candle for sell and break of high of the candle as buy.How do you decide the bias whether you want to go for buy or sell? Regards, Bedayan.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
You need to leave your PC running with mt4 also running. The Ea places pending orders. If its not doing so, u need to check if u have enabled the Ea, and allowed it to take trades without confirmation via options

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Pending orders are placed on both the buy and the sell. The price dictates which one gets hit

--- 帖子 #219 ---
My broker is GMT. Should I change Day Start at 0 instead of 2 in the EA setting ? EA placed just one pending order ??

--- 帖子 #220 ---
yes you should. If it only placed one pending order, there should be an error message. Could you tell me what it is?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I've been very busy lately. I'll catch up to you guys later Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi All, I have one more question related to this strategy.I was just doing back testing on this strategy.I found following one scenario.Can you please let me know what you will do in this scenario. Sometime I see entry 1(break of daily bar high or low).I have entered and with that as per the rule I also place a pending order type 2 entry.Now type I stop loss got hit and type 2 run into profit.After that on same daily candle again type I entry occured.Should you guys take again second time type I entry(break of high or low) entry on same daily candle? Regards, Bedayan.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Can't find any message error....

--- 帖子 #224 ---
All pending order are valid til end of the day. So yes, you would take the opposite trade.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Actually this is a kind of grey area that I haven't gotten a confirmation from basber yet. He says all pending orders stay till end of day, but there's also another post where he says that he removes all orders once tp2 is hit

--- 帖子 #226 ---
My Ea placed 4 pending orders correctly at 0gmt. Something must have blocked the orders on your side. Can u please check if there are error messages in either the journal or experts tab?

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Yes. That is my understanding. Pending orders are valid till end of the day, but once one is triggered, you will only remove the opposite pending order iff and only if TP2 is reached. If TP1 is reached or SL is hit, the opposite pending order is still valid. Hope Basber can clarify that.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I just realised that my pc shut down during the night for energy saving. Have removed that. Will check on Sunday/Monday what is the issue because i've seen only one pending order.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi All, I guess I am unclear in my explanation.Let me go step by step.This is the process is followed in this strategy.Please see below. Each candle we are setting two type I entry(break of high or low of the candle).Now when any one of the type I entry getting triggered we are removing other type I entry. Next after removing the type I entry we are adding another entry which is type II entry. Now when type I entry move to TP2 we are removing the type II entry. Next point is In same daily candle sometime it happens you get two times type I signal two times.Suppose First type I buy signal you got just after newyork close and next type I buy signal you got after london close and newyork open then in same candle you are getting two times type I buy signal.Will you take both the signal? Regards, Bedayan.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Looks like previous day's range was close enough to 170 pips as to make trading on Friday invalid.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
To the best of my understanding, u place each set of orders only once, and never remove them unless tp2 is hit, or end of the day. For your example, the first buy triggers and u add a reverse trade at the sl point. U should not remove the sell pending order on other side of bracket at this point. If the trade is taken out and the price returns to the initial buy price again, it should be ignored. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi DP This is how my chart looked like this morning, I removed the ea and placed it to a new chart and the box was drawn correctly after that but I had no trades triggered today. Thanks

--- 帖子 #233 ---
You need to set decimal =4 in the Ea settings. Your broker does not offer minipips. See if that solves it If its the decimal causing problems, there should be an error thrown. Se if u can find it

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Nice day today .. 3 TP1 s and 2 TP2 ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I'm confused basber. I thought u said to remove all pending orders once tp2 is hit. Or I'd that just for that particular set of orders?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Deathbait, I am not srue whether my understanding is correct or not.I have went through all the threades.As I understand According to the rule If TP2 is heat then second type of entry order(which is entered the moment the Fist entry order got triggered) is removed.Not all the entry orders will be removed. All the entry orders will be removed at the end of the day when any of them got triggered. Regards, Bedayan.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi Deathbait I ran into the same problem as Minos. When the EA is attached to the chart a little before or after 0 GMT the fibonacci box rather than outlining the immediately preceding day it stays with the day before that.Thus no pending orders are placed at the immediately preceding day's high or low. It is only about 10-12 hours after 0 GMT that the box is redrawn correctly to reflect the immediately preceding day. In most cases the high or low would have been penetrated when the box is redrawn properly.And thus it is too late for the EA to place pending orders. I am using FXDD and it is a 5 decimal broker.I am using the default settings No error messages in experts or journal file.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Could you confirm that this is correct basber

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Hi if you are using default settings, your broker time needs to be GMT +2. The box is redrawn only at at 2am broker time at that setting. Can you check if you need to change that variable? Also do note that the Ea will not work for that day if it is not on by GMT 0000

--- 帖子 #240 ---
My apologies Minos. I just realised my Ea may not work properly on 4 digit brokers at all. I'll try to fix it by monday

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Not all, just reverse order for second entry. For example, if the high of the last day break, buy order will execute. Then assume TP2 hit, then you should ONLY remove the sell for second entry. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #242 ---
As Phik said, you should take the opposite trade, but I think you mean entering again the same order. for example if the buy for Type I (Better than first and 2nd entry that I named it) , there will be no other Type I's buy. It means if the SL for Type II entry hit, you should'nt re-enter the first trade, which hit SL previously. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Check the pic DB .. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I just did. I hope I'll do it quite clear .. Don't hesitate to ask if there's still unclear things about it. Regards, BAsber

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Unfortunately I'm a little bit out of time lately, so I'll appreciate if other traders which like to participate in this thread, try to test DB's EA to debug errors. I'll look through it ASAP, but your participation make it much more easier for us to reach a final version soon, because then I could concentrate on errors that you might not observe rather than concentrating on minor errors. Again, great thanks to DB, and anyone who help him (him ? I believe I'm right ). Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Is it possible that it take the trade directly. I mean is it possible that EA don't set orders and take the trade at entrance levels ? I like it more to be a BlackBox, not a GreyBox. Honestly, I don't like my broker understand what's happening ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hello, can you share your fibonacci tools which you use on screen.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
You can find it in any MetaTrader toolbox. Just adjust properties. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thanks Deathbait. I did have it set to GMT + 2 on the latest version 18. But I attached it an hour after the start of the new day. So that may have been the problem. I will try it again Monday. If that indeed was the problem, is there any way of having an option that allows it to update the fib box to the immediately preceding day and to place pending orders assuming entry points have not yet been reached even if it is attached after the start of the new day?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Thanks you understood me correct.Thanks for your answer.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I agree with Basbers post about the pending orders. I got a bit confused about the orders, here are the rules the way I understood them. At the beggining my understanding was: 1 we are placing two orders at day break levels (+-some pips) 2 once one of the two orders is executed the other end order is cancelled 3 when one order is executed (and the other cancelled) we are placing a secondary order where the stop loss is 4 When TP1 is riched we go to break even and when TP2 is riched we cancel all other orders. Now my understanding is: 1 we are placing two orders at day break levels (+-some pips) 2 when one order is executed a secondary order is placed (the order at the other end stays) 3 When TP1 is riched we go to break even and when TP2 is riched we cancel the secondary order. 4 If the market takes the opposite direction and hits the order at the other end, No 2 and No 3 will follow. I hope this helps. If i got it wrong again it is because I burned a couple of thousands brain cells by looking the bars on my computer screen the last two years and please block me from posting in this thread.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I'm attempting to gain a clarification on the entries. Let's say, for example, that a Buy trade is hit. We immediately place a 2nd level Sell order at the Buy trade SL (but maintain the original Sell order at the bottom of the candle). At this point we have 1 Buy trade and 2 pending Sell orders? Price does not hit BE (TP1) on the Buy. Instead, price moves downward and hits the Buy SL. Simultaneously the 2nd level Sell is hit. If price continues down to eventually hit the Sell TP2, we would have 1 Buy trade loss, and 2 Sell trade wins? I hope this correct... If not...

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I read a few pages of the system. In my opinion its a great system, but you need to keep it simple. It started simple and as more and more members joined this discussion, it got more and more complicated because everyone is adding in their own ideas, Should be as simple as below: After mignight that is 00:00 place buy and sell pending orders, also place your stop loss and take profit and forget about the whole thing. Once a profit has been taken, cancel the other pending order. If got stopped out then let the other pending order fill in and exit either on TP or SL. As simple as that. No need for 2 orders in the same direction and taking both buy and sell trades on the same day. It has been proved that the winning systems are the ones that are SIMPLE! So Keep It Simple Please.... One question I want to ask is where to place our Fibonacci on Sunday night for Mondays trades?? Do we use Friday's High and Low or Friday + Sunday's High and Low? John

--- 帖子 #256 ---
John, Respectfully, if your remarks were intended for me, I was simply attempting to obtain clarification on the entries...but NOT changing the method in any fashion. However, your "simplification" does alter the OP original strategy, plus you are also asking for clarification. If your simplification is more profitable than the original, please post your trade results. Thank you. BTW, where is the evidence that the winning systems are simple? Please show us some simple systems that are consistent winners. Good trading.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
We would have a loss from our primary trade and a TP2 trade from the secondary trade. The primary sell stop trade will remain open until the end of the day when it will be cancelled.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi Bob, Sorry, you misunderstood me. My remarks were General not pointing out to any particular person. You are much senior than me and I have great respects for you. Please do not take it personally. The simplest System is to Buy at the Support and Sell at the Resistance using Stochastics. If you wish I can start a thread and show you the daily performance. John

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi John, No problem...no offense taken. I would encourage you to start a thread and show the daily performance. I'm am certain there are many who would agree. Good Trading!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
sorry basber, blackbox trading will have to come later, only after this EA is finalised. v0.19 changelog 1) updated trading rules according to basber's clarifications 2) fixed for 4 digit brokers 4 digit broker users, pls check if it now places trades correctly. It was coded originally with 5 digit brokers in mind, but should do 4 digit ones properly now, provided you change the user variable decimal from 5 to 4 when u attach the EA. EA will now only delete pending orders for secondary orders once primary tp2 is hit. Primary orders from other side of bracket will be left intact(hopefully)

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi DP in my expert folder I have found a text document with the following text in it: 1;39;;;Function "_values_init" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file 1;39;;;Function "_set_box" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file I hope it helps Minos

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi DP this is the EA placed in two demo accounds, boxes are not correct. Thanks

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi Deathbait I had version 19 attached both for Sunday open and today Monday open with time set to GMT + 2 since I use FXDD and it placed no orders. It did not update the Fib box yesterday and it did update it today but only blocked out the first 2 hours from yesterday rather than 24 hours.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Those are redundant functions that will eventually be removed, don't worry about it. We have a problem with the boxing you showed me though. I can't replicate it. And if I can't replicate it, I have no idea how to fix it. Here's v0.19 on my chart, placed there right after i published it here yesterday. As you can see, it drew perfectly and placed orders correctly. If it works on mine, I really have no idea how it doesn't work on yours. Your screenshots really do help though, and I think if you keep posting screenshots, I'll eventually be able to see why it's happening. Honestly, the only conclusion I can draw from your charts currently is that the problem is in the values initialising phase.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi, could you include a chart next time? I'm not quite sure what you mean. I only released v0.19 after monday open.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Just as a reminder on how this ea works guys: It will only place orders at 0GMT(if you set the broker time correctly of course). At 0GMT, it redraws the box to reflect the range, and updates all the variables before setting the orders. If no orders are set at 0 GMT, there SHOULD be an error message under the "experts" tab. It really helps alot if you guys can include a screenshot when you describe your problem, preferably with the experts tab open. thanks

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Deathbait Here is screenshot. No error messages in expert file. Did not place orders and only 2 hours blocked in fib box

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Downloaded fxcm and fxdd These are my screenshots. settings are visible from the expert tabs. All seems to be well??

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks, Deathbait. By changing daystart input from 2 to 3 on FXDD platform seems to have corrected the fib box problem. I will check tomorrow if it will enter orders at the start of the day Tuesday.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I like S/R levels and stoch too.... can you open a thread? Many thanks and sorry for OT

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Well, I switched from my xp netbook to my vista laptop and it looks fine. I don't know why this is happening, xp supposed to be better with mt4. I will be a bit upset as I downgraded to xp with trading in mind.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Vista is a piece of crap anyway, but I digress... I suspect its more a problem of data. Forgot to suggest you refresh your charts

--- 帖子 #274 ---
In did they are crap. how do i refresh my chart? sorry for the question I never heard of it?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
There's a refresh option if u right click your chart. Not sure if it works. I just close my chart and open a new one when I suspect something Is wrong

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Here is screenshot. The Fib box was not updated at close of day and orders were not entered for new day on FXDD platform

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Daystart should be 3, and box + orders will only be set at brokertime 0000+daystart, so in your case, 0300. Correct the daystart value and wait a few more hours Day's not over yet bro

--- 帖子 #278 ---
So did it work properly for you?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Unfortunately no. Still buggy. I changed daystart to 3 on FXDD. It still has not updated fib box or entered orders.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
This sounds like a silly idea, but maybe you should try rebooting=) Unfortunately I turned off my fxdd mt4 yesterday. I'll leave it on to see if mine takes the next open Could you please open a new chart, put on just the EA, and take a screen shot with the experts tab open? Preferably with the last bar visible too. thanks

--- 帖子 #281 ---
yes you're right. don't forget to place the buy for Type II entry after execution of second sell order, if it doesn't reach TP2. I means there are days that you may take 4 trades. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Basber, thank you for the confirmation. I would have probably forgotten to place the level 2 entry after execution of the the second sell order. Now, I think I've got it!

--- 帖子 #283 ---
11 Thanks. It did update fib box after I rebooted but did not enter orders perhaps because you indicated it would not place orders if the expert is attached after 0 GMT.I will see how it works at start of new day tomorrow.Also by inputting 3 in daystart since FXDD is GMT + 2 , it drew the start of the fib box at 1 hour after 0 GMT rather than 0 GMT. Should I not be inputting 2 if I want to reflect 0 GMT on FXDD?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
recheck your gmt time to be sure on my fxdd demo, i need to set to 3 to align it to gmt

--- 帖子 #285 ---
according to this thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=61491 fxdd likes to change to gmt+3 during summer. not sure how true it is, or whether it's summer over there=) you can use this to be sure: http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/

--- 帖子 #286 ---
See chart. I set daystart to 3 on FXDD. Fib box did not update when the new day started.But EA entered buy stop orders based not on high of immediately preceding day (Tuesday) but based on high of 2 days ago (Monday) because the fib box does not update. It did not enter sell orders based on low of 2 days ago possibly because in looking back it calculates that immediately preceding day already penetrated low of fib box 2 days ago. I suggest that you download FXDD demo platform and test it over the next few days and you will see the box does not update when new day starts.

I did have it on, but windows auto update strikes again, and restarted my comp. Will leave it on for tmw k minos, u still having trouble, or is it resolved?

Hi Deathbait You might also want to program the EA so it adds the spread in the case of buy stop entry and buy exit orders.Currently it is not adding the spread. I believe the system assumes the spread is added to the buffer in the case of buy entry as well as the buy exit orders.Thanks

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Basber has never mentioned anything about adding spread.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Bashir Is the following statement true? Does your system add the spread in addition to the 3 pip buffer in the case of buy entry and buy stop orders "I believe the system assumes the spread is added to the buffer in the case of buy entry as well as the buy exit orders."

--- 帖子 #294 ---
btw this is my screenshot for today. it updated the box, but did not place trades because yesterday's range was &gt;170 pips edit: I promised to add spreads for next version, but i realised I'm not sure what you're looking for. Can you please elaborate?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Yes.Typically on the buy side EU the ask is 1 1/2 to 2 pips above the bid depending on the platform. So when Basber's system calls for using 3 pips as a buffer on the buy and sell side in breaking the high or low, actually on the buy side it would be 3 pips plus the 1 or 2 point spread to reflect the ask price. Since the sell order is done at the bid the spread issue does not apply. The same would hold true for reentry buy orders and buy protective stop orders at the fib lines. You would need to add the spread to reflect the ask price. Otherwise if you do not add the spread in actuality you would not be buying at the fib line but 1 to 2 points below the fib line and would be prematurely entering or stopped out.

Hi DP I haven't done much during the week because I was very busy, I have seen that the EA draws the correct box (on vista only on xp the problem remains) , though even when I changed the value in the EA to take the trade today it did not. I have a request for you, because trade management is very personal and it is where some traders do have a better "feeling" comparing to others during the same trade, I would like to see a version of the EA that I will add the values (SL, TP1, TP2) and let the EA take care of the trade after that (a semi automatic version). thanks a lot I will keep all posted

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I would have preferred to iron out fundamental bugs first, but since I can't replicate your problems, I'll see what I can do to give the user more control on Monday's release. Btw, fxdd users, this might be relevant ... forexmagnates.com/nfa-hits-fxdd-with-multiple-charges-including-asymmetric-slippage-fine-will-cost-it-over-3-5m/

--- 帖子 #298 ---
fxdd on my comp placed the orders fine... guess you'll have to figure out what's wrong on your end man

--- 帖子 #299 ---
nice plot of entry , straight forward . Let the party begins, 2 more hours.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Well, no real bug reports this week, so this is a minor update to allow adding of spreads. Leave the new variable setting at the default 0 if you don't want to add it. v0.20 changelog 1) added spread as a user variable for those who wish to add their spreads to the TP

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks for the update.Is it possible to add little bit of money management in this ea.For example enter buy or sell with two lot system.First lot taken out in (1:1 or 1;2) risk reward ration and second lot either have option 1:2 risk reward or trail the stop. What I want to say how many lot you enter that can be modifiable in EA. Also risk reward ration for each individual lot can be modfiable also. Means For exapmple for First lot closed at TP1 or 1:1 or 1:2 risk reward ration. Second lot may be taken on either TP2 or 1:2 or trail the stop based on initial stop we put.(means if we put 20pip stop.for each 20 pip movement stop move further 20 pip) This should be applicable to both Type I and Type II both entry.Based on the variable you select order will be executed. Regards, Bedayan.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Highly unlikely this is going to happen, because that's not in the spirit of this system at all. There are a few buzzwords floating around the forums I hate. Risk:reward ratio is definitely up there on the list. Bear in mind that what matters is expected value. Risk:reward ratio is just one half of that equation. I might consider the floating stop option for tp2 though, because it doesn't really contradict the original system

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi , I have following queston regarding you EA. 1. for Type 2 entries where do you put your stop loss.How many pips above the Entry point? 2.I was just back testing with your EA I found lotsize is keeps on increasing.Can you let me know what logic lot size getting increased or decreased? 3. I asked for risk reward because want to see which is better way to maximize the profit.Definitely if we trail stop it increase the profit.Initially I thaught for first lot 1:2 with trail the stop with same amount the stop losss we are having and second lot trail the stop completely with same trail stop cocept.I back test it manually it looks prmising.That is why I want to do it extensively with the help of an EA.That is why I asked for those option. Regards, Bedayan chakrabarty. 919830347890.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
1) sl is determined by range of precious day as per this strategy's rules 2) lotsize is determined as a function of your risk appetite and the sl for that day 3) the settings of tp and sl points are the essence of this strategy. There is no "definitely " about a trailing stop being more profitable. I repeat, the only thing I may consider is a trailing stop for tp2. Anything else and the strategy isn't the same anymore. 4) you seem unclear about the basics of this strategy. This thread is only 20 pages long. If you haven't already done so, could you please do me the courtesy of reading it's entirety before demanding I mutate it to fit your personal strategy.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I have went through again the thread again.I have question regarding your EA.What did it mean by Trade Monday= True or False? As per my understanding if Trade Monday= True then based on Friday candle Monday trade will be placed. If false then Friday candle will be ignored.There will be no trade on Monday.Based on Monday candle Tuesday trade will be placed.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
You are correct. Its an old variable from an early version of the Ea that had problems with Monday trades. I will likely remove it soon as Monday trade logic seems stable

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi Deathbait Here is pic of chart. Note it only blocks out 2 hours from over a day ago. It entered orders based on the low of those 2 hours and not the high. My experience is that no matter what version I try on FXDD it does not update until after 10-12 hours from 0 GMT when it is supposed to update and by then it is too late as it will not enter any orders after 0 GMT.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thanks B. Idea: If initial buy or sell entries hit sl: 100 moves to 75, how about a recovery trade from 75 to 50 or 75 to 38 0 moves to 25, how about a recovery trade from 25 to 50 or 25 to 62 Thoughts? BD

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I really can't help you. I've tried installing FXDD and everything works on my end, so I can't replicate your errors. Have you tried restarting your computer/mt4 platform, or putting it on a new chart? I'm out of ideas

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Basber... Nice Job with the system...thanks for share. I'm going to try it. Regards, Nando.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
hey DP, which broker are you using to test your EA? Let me see where is the problem with my broker or my system. Thanks

--- 帖子 #312 ---
GBP / USD is another pair to look at.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Why is the fib box not updating to the current position? Happens every day.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
I'm running this on fxdd, gomarkets and pepperstone , and they all draw boxes/place orders perfectly fine. I can't figure out why it's not working for some of you guys. Especially when you tell me Vista works and xp doesn't. It doesn't make sense to me at all.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
For those of you where this is not working ...check your gmt offset

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I have no idea, really. I've reread the code countless times when similar problems cropped up for some of these guys, and couldn't figure out what's happening. It works perfectly fine for various brokers' demos I have running. Not sure how many people here have their EAs running perfectly, but are keeping silent, but it's comforting to know that basber's one seems to be doing fine too.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
here's an interesting optimisation chart. what you think basber? starts from daily max range 500-&gt;2000, 100 increments it appears the sweet spot is around the 100pip area

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I did a statistical analysis in R on the daily range, and the % probability of hitting TP2. I think there is a better target to set for the take profit, rather than the 50% fib extension of previous day's range. Looking at the past 3 years of data, the mean range was 159 pips. Breaking the data into up days: # up days statistics to test chance of hitting TP # percent chance high above buy TP (50% daily fib extension) 0.4306306 # percent chance high above daily R2 0.3963964 # percent chance high above daily R1 0.781982 # percent chance high above daily pivot 0.9873874 So it is better to set the TP at the daily R1 (78% chance of filling), rather than the 50% fib extension. Similar results for down days: # percent chance low below sell TP (50% daily fib extension) 0.4471243 # percent chance low below daily S2 0.1929499 # percent chance low below daily R1 0.7736549 # percent chance low below daily pivot 0.9814471 Regards, EZ

--- 帖子 #319 ---
stupid pet peeve, so bear with me....your figures are in actual probability rather than percentage chance. Could you do me a favour and get your code to calculate the EV per trade instead of probability of hitting TP? That would be a more valuable figure to have, I think. Also, I just want to clarify, so we're on the same page regarding data. Did you track tick, minute, or daily data to get your result? The difference being, if all you did was compare if price went past a certain point on a certain day, it ignores the days where price hits SL first, and then goes back to hit the TP. (which, on a visual backtest, will tell you happens sometimes).

--- 帖子 #320 ---
stupid pet peeve, so bear with me....your figures are in actual probability rather than percentage chance. Yes ... you are correct. % chance would be those #'s multiplied by 100. My bad ... ;-) Could you do me a favour and get your code to calculate the EV per trade instead of probability of hitting TP? That would be a more valuable figure to have, I think. Good idea ... yes, that would be more useful. I'll post it tomorrow ... midnight now so off to bed. Also, I just want to clarify, so we're on the same page regarding data. Did you track tick, minute, or daily data to get your result? The difference being, if all you did was compare if price went past a certain point on a certain day, it ignores the days where price hits SL first, and then goes back to hit the TP. (which, on a visual backtest, will tell you happens sometimes). I didn't use tick or minute data ... only daily. So I can't analyze if SL hit first, then hit TP. I did do some SL analysis though, just based off of previous S1, S2, etc. For example, for an up day, the probability of the low being lower than the S1 is 0.236. So if you used only the stats, and put a buy stop at the previous day high (or above by a few pips) with a SL at the S1 (0.236 probability of being hit if breakout), and TP at the R1 (0.782 probability), chances are it will be hitting the TP and not the SL. You can put a sell stop and SL and TP at the low also. As I type this, I guess I should also calculate probabilities of L &lt; previous day L for up days ... Anyway, this is just a start ... I want to try to improve the odds by different filters, such as is low &gt; some EMA (in an uptrend) ... what are the stats for upside breakouts Also I will test NR4 and NR7 breakouts to see if this improves the stats for hitting a target and SL. Additional analysis such as seasonality of currency trends and COT analysis may help improve the odds of breakout trades. I would like to do a rigorous analysis and find the best settings for a breakout strategy, and just set and forget each day ... I'll add this to the other system's I'm trading. I just think more analysis should be done, rather than just arbitrarily setting TP at 50% fib extensions of previous day's range ... I like to see stats to back things up. :-) Thanks for the comments ... answers in bold above. EZ

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Whoa, you sound exactly like me lol. I've been working to write a backtest in C for the last week using tick data from Oanda going back to 2004. Sadly, it's still a work in progress. You're obviously moving much faster than I am. Please share your findings when you get them. I'm always interested in figures.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I am not sure how you use pivot for stop and take profit.Then how you use pivot for type II entries stop and take profit?Sometime S1 or R1 comes very close to last day candle high or low.In that case what you will do?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I tried twice to calculate the EV from your figures, but came up with gapping holes in information needed both times=( Mostly, I think to use those figures, at the very least, we will need to know how often neither TP nor SL gets hit on the following day. That's not even counting trades that require moving into the third day.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hi Deathbait I attach various print screens of my Alpari Demo a/c since 3rd july. I am more than happy with the ea - running perfectly! Trust this helps. Cheers

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Thanks Dave. Good to know

--- 帖子 #326 ---
my trade picture : Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I had some unintended fortune after I posted earlier. I changed timeframes on my chart and the ea lost all data and pending orders and is obviously waiting for the next trading cycle. As it turned out - a result! Both SL's would have been hit! I would have accepted the loss anyway and moved on to the next day. Deathbait, maybe you could look at what happened to me and see if there is a fix so that we can change timeframes without the ea dropping everything.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Going to try the Alpari demo. What EA settings are you using?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
the EA is set to remove all pending orders when it is removed from the chart. Kind of a protective measure. When you change timezones, the EA is removed, and than applied again. That's why your pending orders got deleted. If you wish to disable this "feature", open the code in the editor, and change the following function from : int deinit() { //---- ObjectsDeleteAll(); clear_orders(); //---- return(0); } to int deinit() { //---- ObjectsDeleteAll(); //---- return(0); }

--- 帖子 #330 ---
daystart set to: 3 to match Alpari and risk multiplier to: 5% (My choice). All other settings ootb. Trust that you find it of help

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Many thanks Deathbait. Will apply changes. Small request - any chance you can make the colour of the box a user variable?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
just right click on chart, select objects list, and change the colour property of the rectangle.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Yes, already done that but when I reload it defaults to the blue again. I cannot find the colour in the programme to change. No probs, just a small pain.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Good day for the system... 2 TP's hit. Regards, Nando.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Yes, same here - TP2 hit. After my earlier problem I entered the trades manually - +42 pips!

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I forgot to mention that for the trades on 6th July I altered the MaxRange on the ea from 1700 (170 pips) to 1800 (180 pips) to allow trading after the 175 pip range on the 5th July. Worth 124 pips!

--- 帖子 #338 ---
hi please send me last version of EA thanks alot best regards

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi fellow "David". You can download the ea v0.19 I am using from Page 18 #261. I don't see the need for v0.20. My settings are in #330 and I applied deathait's suggested changes in #320.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Sorry, last post should read #329 not #320

--- 帖子 #341 ---
It is early days yet with this ea as to long term profitability and before I am prepared to go live. I am aware that the thread starter "Basber" (where have you gone?) has done a lot of research and analysis before he so kindly introduced this "Strategy". Sincerely, many thanks. Again, my sincere thanks also to "deathbait" for his work on the ea.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
thanks alot buffer value is 30 is this for 5 decimal and i must change it to 3 for 4 decimal chart? i think buffer value for distance from high or low from order

--- 帖子 #343 ---
sell eurusd : +57 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge) thanks basber for sharing tour trading system. good luck.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Yes, I think so. My demo is with Alpari UK who is 5 digit. deathbait may want to confirm.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
yes change it to 3 for 4 decimal chart. pls tell me if anything's broken for 4 decimal brokers. I wrote this for 5 decimal brokers and added 4 decimal functionality, but never tested it.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
hi every body what time EA set orders? because i use it in my chart now and no orders set yet does this ea set orders when high or low break? have a nice time

--- 帖子 #347 ---
it sets orders at 0GMT. If you activate the EA later than that, it will start working the next day

--- 帖子 #348 ---
deathbait, when i slap the EA onto my chart it takes off everything else like support and resistance, trendlines etc and i am unable to place them back on until i reopen chart etc. Is it just me who has this problem?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Like the problem with pending orders being remved when you unloading the Ea, this was also deliberately implemented. I put in a couple of safeguards when coding it.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Actually scratch that. I know its supposed to remove all objects when u put it on, but u should still be able to draw lines after its on

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I can draw lines etc but if i change time frame or log back in they disappear, which makes it awkward when analyzing the markets. Maybe its just my problem i don't know.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Its not just your problem. Everytime you change timeframe is like putting the Ea on again, which deletes every object on the chart. I'll see what I can do to change this behaviour

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Thanks i'm surprised nobody else mentioned it on here. One more thing ironed out i guess.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Its not a bug really. In fact, u really shouldn't be doing anything else on a chart with an Ea on it. Like changing timeframes. Just so everyone is clear, the moment the Ea is refreshed (for eg, timeframe changed), it no longer manages the trades properly. Be careful.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi guys, great thread. I am pulling up a chair here... Regarding the EA's: 1. what happens to the EA if there is a power outage and the PC switches off? 2. ok say the power is not an issue (PC lugged into UPS) what happens if the machine loses internet connectivity? 3. are orders placed on the broker's server when you pull the EA onto you chart? or are orders placed at the time (at market) when price reaches the designated levels? To Basber, thank you for sharing this method and to Deathbait, many thanks for making available the EA. Arnold

--- 帖子 #356 ---
1) the orders come in 3 waves of pending orders. If power is lost and then turned back on, the EA will no longer place subsequent waves of orders until the next trading day 2) If internet connectivity is lost, pending orders stay on the server and will be executed. Orders to be placed on subsequent waves SHOULD trigger when the connection is restored, unless price has moved past those orders in the meantime 3) This EA uses pending orders, which are placed on the server side.

Hello Traders ! My name is Andrej and I'm new to Forex Factory, although I've been trading Forex for about two years now. Honestly, I haven't encountered a system that would be so simple and effective at the same time as the this one yet. Really thank you Basper for posting it ! As I rely more on manual testing, I performed a backtest on EUR/USD from 1.1.2012 until now with the results attached in the excell. Although it's not perfect, I believe it should be at least 90% true. Parameters like innitial balance, spread and risk per trade are adjustable. This is how your balance would develop if you traded this system this year. I may enlarge the testing period as I have more time in following days. Hope it helps you. Andrej

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hello Deathbait ! I also want to thank you for EA you made for this system. I'd like to ask you something, I use GMT + 2hours broker. If I open your EA on 30min chart at let's say 23.20 my server time, what should I do to set the EA to work properly for the next day? I'd like it to calculate the levels based upon my server time, not GMT, but GMT+2. Thank you for you respond !

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I'm not really understanding you, but I think you want one of these 2 things, so pick the setting you prefer 1) if you're hoping to set orders at GMT 0000 as per this strategy's rules, set the variable daystart to 2 2) if you're hoping to set orders at 0000 your broker time(not the rules of this strategy), set daystart to 0

--- 帖子 #360 ---
My demo on the out of the box settings of the EA is going well: http://widgets.myfxbook.com/widgets/335702/large.jpg Thanks deathbait!

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hello DB, thank you for your respond. Please, could you confirm that I understand it well ?: I use GMT+2 hrs broker and I want EA to draw the box at 00.00 (GMT+2hrs) taking into consideration last 24 hours. Do I set the daystart parameter to 0 and turn on the EA anytime before 00.00(GMT+2) and wait for the orders which will be placed by EA exactly at 00.00(GMT+2) ? Thank you, DB. Andrej

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Yup

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hello DB, I just tried to run the EA the way you told me, however, when 00.00 (broker time) occured, nothing happened. Have you got any idea what could go wrong ? Daystart had been set to "0"I am attaching the pics. Thanks for your help. Andrej.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I had the same issue. He doesn't seem to know why this happens. You may have to trade this one manually for now.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
[quote=Basber;5667771]Hi dear traders, First Entry : Buy 3 pips above the High of previous day (Entry on fibo lines), SL is 1 pip below "SL" line on you fibonacci tool. We have 2 TPs. One is when price reaches "BE" line above the high of the previous day (1.25 fibonacci or -0.25 fibo, depends how you draw the fibo.), then you should close half and put your SL at BE (Bring your SL on your entry point - No risk from here). You second TP is "TP2" line on your fibo tool. Vice versa for short entry. Second Entry : When you enter long ( After entry triggered ), you should place a sell order right where your SL is. SL for your sell order is 1 pip above the previous day high and TP1 (and of course BE (Break Even) Point) is 0.5 on fibo which is shown is "BE" on you fibo between two "SL"s. TP2 is 1 pip above the "SL" for short entry. You must erase the order IF price reaches TP2 . Vice versa for short entry. ** You must cancel all your orders when current day comes to an end and place new orders due to current day's high and low. hi,i've got some questions about the orders 1. by first order the second tp is tp2 line on fibo,why is it 1 pip above/below the line "sl" by second order,is'nt it on the line exactly? 2. by a sell order (second order) the sl is 1 pip above previous day's high, that means 3 pips above include the spread of 2 pips? 3. when current day has ended we must cancel the orders,but what about the orders on previous day trigerred and didnt hit the sl or tp,i mean should we manualy stop them? thank you!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
pls i dont understand multiplier...can u explain ?

thanks Andrej, I've uncovered an error for people with daystart 0 and below. Working on it now

--- 帖子 #368 ---
v0.21 changelog 1) EA no longer deletes every object on the chart when removed 2) fixed a bug for daystart &lt;1 !!This is a critical update for people who requires daystart to be 0 and below!! If you have had a problem with the EA before, and your daystart is 0 or negative, please see if this fixes the problem.

Hello DB, thank you for your EA update. At the moment it paints the box correctly, however, it still doesn't do anything at the time it should. Please see the pic. Anyways, thank you for your effort to help ;-) Andrej

--- 帖子 #370 ---
That's odd. It didn't paint the box correctly either. How long has this Ea been on the chart

EA instead of an indicator? Are you allowing it to trade for you?

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I've never written an indicator for this strategy. Have you even read the thread?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
this EA set pending orders or instant orders(when price breaks H or L then set orders)? because i set it in my chart but no pending orders set.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
EA sets pending orders at GMT0000 if you set the daystart variable properly. You need to have the EA on before that time, or wait till next day. I think this will be the last time I respond to such repetitive questions

thanks I test this EA in strategy tester from 01/01/2011 till 01/01/2012 but this EA only set first buystop in high of previous days and second entry for sell stop and this EA dont set first sell stop orders and second buystop orders plz test it

Usually it works better when it's around ATR(14) - daily. nowdays it's around 100 ... I may share another strategy that I developed with the help from some ideas from different traders. When I share it, it will give you a tool to optimize this method. But it can not put in an EA. It uses bar analysis (James16 thread) and volume on M15. Takes your time, but will increase the profit ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Usually I consider TP1 as a solid level for my trades management. I'll play with TP2 sometimes, usually trail it when I see the opportunity for the price to move in my favor. As I recommended before, don't change SL, Entry levels. It's better to keep the TP1 in place and set SL @ BE at that level. TP2 is optional. I'm sure there are better ways to take TP rather than the main concept. Feel free to try it and share so other's can have benefit from your research, if you like. Optimizing a strategy need high experience in this business, so many can't do it. So I still recommend less experienced traders to stick to main levels, unless they've done a very comprehensive backtest. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #381 ---
That would be fantastic and greatly appreciated.

I usually been very busy lately .. I will check the thread now and then, but it's not very often. I asure you that I'll read every post and will answer the ones that remained without any answers. I also like to introduce my other strategy than you can combine it with Daily Break Strategy, but that one is not as simple as this one, so supporting the thread needs more time. That's why I'm waiting for a right time to share, so I can support the traders which follow that thread. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #385 ---
You're welcome Andrej. It will get better when I introduce the other strategy, but it will not be as simple as now. It's simple though, but it needs experience. It will nicely boost the results. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #386 ---
LOL ! I think by "Bashir", you meant me !! Anyway, Spread should be added. I think DB made it right for EA. When placing orders manually, yes, you should add spread. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Thank you for your work and time DB ... Keep up the good job

--- 帖子 #388 ---
1) Nope, it's should be 1 pip beyond the line. Because I believe it should clear the level. It's not that important in this scale which we are trading. 2) Yes. 3) No, You should leave them with their TPs and SLs. Don't change anything, manage your trade according to basic rules and place the new day's orders too. Regards, Basber

Results with EA, version 22 from 1 Feb 2011 till 30 may 2011. I'll wait for DB to correct the bugs, then test more ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #394 ---
A little history on the EA. It was originally designed to only work on 1H charts. As an afterthought, I decided to complicate it by making it work on every timeframe. Amazingly, none of us caught this rather obvious bug but basber(example 5). This error happened because part of the code still assumed we were working with an H1 chart. After I fixed that, most of the errors pointed out here became clear. Basber, please test this again, since I'm unable to test the dates you pointed out here in the office. **requires clarification** Basber, I've asked this before, but you apparently missed it. What happens if the low of the day was at GMT 2359, and the price moves past our target before we can place the trade at GMT 0000? Do we ignore that trade? Force a trade at a worse price? Or do we ignore all trades that day? What the EA does currently is to ignore that particular part of the trade and trade the other side as per normal. Charts : 1) No sell order due to both the timeframe bug and the above price slip problem 2) Monday gapped below the low of friday. No trades taken according to rules. On this note, I want to confirm that monday trades are taken on monday GMT 0000(which is what's happening now), and not at broker sunday open. 3) EA will be too late to remove the order once it gaps. In any case, this looks like chart data error. Price doesn't usually gap like that on normal days. 4) Reviewing the code that manages orders that carry over. This will not be a quick fix. 5) same as (1) 6) Your assumption about my misinterpretation of your rules is spot on. Will be fixed in next patch. 7) same as (1) TODO: 1) Timeframe bug(done) 2) TP2 order cancel logic rewrite 3) Order management for trades carried over 2nd day

--- 帖子 #395 ---
v0.23 changelog 1) box drawing fix for timeframes other than H1 2) changed order cancel on TP2 logic as per basber's clarification basber, I can't replicate your chart due to insufficient data, but testing gives me these charts, which show SL moved to BE when TP1 is hit on the following day.

What is the best currency pair to use for this system?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Quoted from the first post :

--- 帖子 #398 ---
So EUR/USD?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hello DB, today I tried to test the last version of EA (23) as to 19.00 of my broker time (GMT+3) so I set the daystart parameter to -5 as far as I understand it correctly. As at 19.00, however, the new box wasn't painted. The buy setups were inserted according to the old box (the period prior to the correct one). There were no sell setups inserted. Have you got any idea, why it didn't work out well ? Could it be because of the negative daystart parameter ? I'm sorry for posting posts like that. I'd rather post that it works properly! But I really appreciate your effort, DB. Have a nice weekend Andrej

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Yes, EUR/USD and GBP/USD seem to be the best pairs for this system

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Yeah. I tried making it possible to use negative numbers, but I guess I still missed stuff. Right now it really only works for 0-23. Negative numbers is a work in progress and quite frankly, not on my priority list

--- 帖子 #402 ---
No Problem DB, as long as "0" value works, it's perfect for me. I just didn't have a chance to test it today, cause it's friday. I'll do it on monday ;-) Once again, thank you, you do a great work

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Same issue happens on my platform even though I'm using positive numbers. Seems to be a major issue with the move to the previous day from the day before. I would vote for a removal of this feature and a more semi-automated EA that is manually placed on the chart and set in motion by the user.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Your issue has been discussion to death. I have tested the Ea on several brokers and can't replicate your error. Others have done the same thing. It is the opposite of a "major issue". The way it stands currently, its a non issue. Until I can replicate the error, there's nothing I can do. I would appreciate it if u stop beating this dead horse

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...62#post4760762 If you're running vista or win7, this might be the problem. As always, Google is your friend

--- 帖子 #406 ---
H Basber, I have tried to test this strategy in other pairs like NZDUSD,GBPJPY with same setting its working good.I take entry only in NR4 and NR7 candles. One negative point to this strategy is Trading this strategy without the EA.I have tried to trade it manually set the trade and while Asia time I was in sleep trade triggered made huge lossess because First entry order was in loss and second entry order I am not able to place because I was in sleept that time.If I used the EA I could have been in profit. Regards, Bedayan.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Sorry, but what's NR4?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
You can use the main idea in different pairs, but calibrate it first to fit the pair. Changes must be done, even minor changes. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #410 ---
While it may still be a good idea to do the stuff listed there if running vista or windows 7, don't think it's what's causing the problem

--- 帖子 #411 ---
You may be right. I do not have XP but I have both WIN 7 and Vista and tried the EA on both with the same problem. i.e.. the fib box not advancing at 0 GMT on the new day. I wonder if those finding the EA to properly move the fib box on the new day are exclusively XP users or if Vista/Win7 users found success. Perhaps there is a workaround on those 2 systems to avoid the OS bug and get the EA to work

--- 帖子 #412 ---
The solution to the problem is found on the thread I linked. Unfortunately, I don't think its the reason for your problems, after reading up on it

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Deathbait Do you have access to Vista or WIN7 or have you been testing exclusively on XP?. Perhaps if you have Vista or Win7 you can try the EA on them and see if you have the same issue.This may potentially confirm or eliminate the OS the source of the problem.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Andrej, I just checked my code for 0.23, and it appears that i already fixed the bug I imagined caused your problem. Apparently, you've been struck by the same problem as a few of the people here. I'm gonna give solving it one last try, based on a wild hunch on what might be wrong. If you guys would do me the favor of checking your local time(computer settings), and telling me what GMT offset it is, I can check to see if my guess is correct. A special appeal to k minos, who managed to get it to run properly on vista, and not on xp. If my guess is correct, your local time is set differently on the two OSes.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
vista and win7 problems with mt4 are rather well documented, as are steps to overcome them. If you're running on either, you should follow the fixes to prevent problems in future. However, the EA in no way is affected by the problems, and so it shouldn't be the OS. Would be great if people could tell me their local time(computer time)'s GMT offset and whether the EA works properly, so I can confirm my current suspicions

--- 帖子 #416 ---
My current time (and computer time) in Arizona USA is 7.34 AM. which is 2.34 PM GMT. EA does not work properly on Vista or Win7 operating system. Fib Box does not seem to update until 8 or 9 hours after 0GMT. I hope that helps

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I should also mention that I have used it on both the FXDD and Interbank platforms trying it at GMT +2 and GMT +3 and neither updates box as well as Interbank 0 input for GMT as Interbank changes day at 0 GMT. Still no fib box update until 7-8 hours after that.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Just double click on the clock on the bottom right of your screen and read me the os GMT offset

--- 帖子 #419 ---
When I right click on it and go to the dropdown menu there is no GMT time but there is something called Coordinated Universal time which is 2.58 PM (same as GMT) while my current time is 7.58 AM

--- 帖子 #420 ---
I just thought of something. As I recall there were GMT offsets such as GMT, GMT + 1, GMT + 2, etc when user right clicked on the time in earlier operating systems. However with WIN7 there are no such GMT offsets listed. There is Coordinated Universal Time (GMT), Coordinated Universal Time + 12, etc. Your EA calls for inputs based on GMT. Perhaps because there is no reference to GMT in the Win 7 OS time system, this may be the root of the problem. It would be great if you could test the EA on a Win7 OS and see how your EA relates to Win7 time system of Coordinated Universal Time.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
nope, that doesn't affect the EA in any way. you're gmt-7 btw. Arizona?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
...especially after I figured out the documentation on the function call StrToTime() was erroneous and might have been the culprit to this elusive problem. If what I suspect is true, everyone who set the GMT offset correctly, AND has a local time of GMT + negative number got the bug, and those that report success have local time set to GMT + positive number. So basically, if your localtime on your computer is set to run on anywhere near to pacific time, you should have gotten the bug. Note that if all you've done is backtest via strategy tester, the bug will not be evident even if you're affected due to the way the strategy tester handles time. So here's v0.24. It may : a) create new bugs for currently working EAs, and solve nothing for those bugged ones b) solve the bugged EAs and create new bugs for the working ones c) do nothing d) solve the existing bug, and not kill the existing working EAs It SHOULD do (d), but I really hope you guys can test this for me so we can quickly put this issue behind us. This bug has consumed way too much of my time as it is. Again, this bug will not appear in the backtest or any simulation due to the way time is handled in the strategy tester. All we can do is slap this EA on and wait for the monday open to see if the box updates properly for everyone. fingers crossed guys!

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hello DB, I don't know if this post is still relevant, but my Computer time is 1:54 am at the moment, which is GMT(UTC)+2. However, the computer says it's GMT+1 for some reason.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Helps more than you know. I realise now that the 0.24 will not solve your problem. However, if it solves the problem for others while not working for you, I will know exactly why the bug appears and how to solve it once and for all.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
It is Sunday and FXDD is open for trading I tried version 24. As you indicated my local time is GMT-7 in Arizona. When I input GMT + 3 in the FXDD platform I get no fib box at all unlike version 23 when I did get a fib box but it did not advance when the new day started. However when I input -21 in daystart input on version 24 it draws the fib box similar to what I was getting under version 23 using GMT + 3 as daystart input. Although it still does not appear to advance or place orders.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I think Version 24 might be updating now on WIN7 in my GMT-7 local computer time. Not sure. Probably have a better idea when Monday ends and Tuesday starts to see if it updates and places orders.. Here is a picture on FXDD with input 2 in daystart on Version 24. Seems to box up to the end of Friday. At the same time there is also a picture of Version 23 with 2 input in daystart and the fib box ending on Thursday close has not updated.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// v0.25 changelog 1) 0.24 created it's own set of errors. 0.25 fixes them. 0.24 was the result of blind rage over bad documentation at mql4.com. Thinking about it last night, I realised that the quick fix probably created another different set of problems. 0.25 is what 0.24 would have been if I wasn't angry and tired. Sorry guys. Don't post any more 0.24 results. I would prefer if it never existed.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hello DB, it seems that for some reasons and technical issues the EA doesn't work properly for all traders. It may be because of Vista or any other reason. Maybe the idea to create simple semiautomated system wouldn't be that bad. This way those traders that have problems with your EA could use it untill all EA bugs are fixed. Let's say that the EA could work in such a way that you manually enter the high and the low of the previous day and immediatelly particular pending orders would be placed lasting untill the hour which you also personally input (unless cancelled otherwise.) There would be simply no box, no shift of the box, just pending orders placed according to the values (high, low) manually entered which would behave in accordance with the system. Entries 1, Entries 2 etc. What do you think about it ? Would it be a lot of additional work ? Anyways, thanks a lot for all your effort you made untill now. It's really honorable. Andrej

--- 帖子 #429 ---
The box is cosmetic. The Ea does not rely on the box. I got it to draw the box as aan afterthought, using values the Ea uses to place the trades. Removing the box would do nothing. I'm almost certain it's a time bug, and that 0.25 should fix it. This strategy relies on time alot, and even semi automatic programs will rely on ironing out the time based bugs.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I know, my point was that maybe this time element could be eliminated at all and it would be all about pending orders (semi automated version). It would be up to your responsibility to cancell limits at the end of each day and input new highs/lows and have your EA place new pendings. The thing is, yesterday and today i tested v.25 and it doesn't seem to work either. At least not with negative daystart parameter.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I think Version 25 is now working on my Win7 operating system with local computer time of GMT-7. I have input GMT + 3 in daystart on FXDD platform and it did draw a new fib box at Monday day's end and placed orders.Thanks,DB, for your tenaciousness in fixing the problem.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
v0.26 changelog 1) fixed a minor bug that will affect box placement when EA is first put on the chart. In the spirit of cleaning up older bugs with unintended consequences... If any of you had 0.25 placing orders correctly, but box drawn wrongly the first time you put the EA on the chart, this should solve the problem

--- 帖子 #433 ---
v0.27 changelog 1) small fix for wrong variable call in 0.26

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Could not wait for new strategy.When you are planning to release it? Regards, Bedayan.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi DP, Nice work, thank you. one bug I noticed with version 25 is that the SL wasn't moved to BE after TP1 is taken. I will move to V 27 and test it for tomorrow. Thanks

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Trading logic hasn't changed in a while. Did anyone else have the same problem yesterday?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Thanks to Basber for the strategy and Deathbait for the EA. I am currently using V23 of the EA on a Wall Street Broker demo account. I am using WSB as their trading day starts at 0.00 GMT. I did not have a problem with the stop moving to BE yesterday, I hit T1 with half the trade and the other half was out at BE. The issue I have noticed is the EA doesn't take the spread into consideration, I have a 2 pip spread and have add spread set to 2.0 but it doesn't seem to make any difference, it adjusts for the 3 pip buffer but not the spread.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
can you confirm that it enters orders at only high/low+3 and not high/low + 3+2? looking at the code, that seems impossible a screenshot would be most helpful thanks

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Do you have a 5 digit broker. If so you want to add 20.0 to the spread. I have added 15 in the case of my broker to the spread input and it does add the spread

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I have a 4 digit broker. Screen shot attached Prev days high 1.2138 Prev days low 1.2042 my understanding is the buy should be 1.2138 + 3 + 2 = 1.2143 sell is ok 1.2042 - 3 = 1.2039

--- 帖子 #441 ---
hey man i just did a quick test and can't replicate your error. Can you recheck that the add_spread variable is non-zero? Your math is indeed correct, and the buy entry should be set a 1.2143.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
add spread is 2.0 I have reset the EA and will run it again on the next hour.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
lol i think i figured out what's wrong you set spread at 2, decimal at 4 and buffer at 30? spread needs to be at 20, decimal 4, buffer 30. Sorry if it's confusing, but this was originally designed to work only on 5 digit brokers.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
ok, thanks for your time, I will give it a try

--- 帖子 #445 ---
v0.28 changelog 1) fixed bug with manipulating orders carried over the weekend 2) added option to use ATR14 for maximum range instead of arbituary value of 170 pips finally figured out the bug posted by basber in post #391, chart 4 added the option to use daily ATR for maximum range instead of 170 pips, as basber commented on recently

--- 帖子 #446 ---
problem solved, thank you.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I am using Version 27. Target one was reached after the high was broken today but the stop was not adjusted to breakeven on second lot as called for by the system.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
damn. Can't think of why that would happen. I have a demo running v0.27 in the office. Will check it to see if the TP was moved for me when i get in tommorrow. In the meantime, anyone else had the same problem today? As always, screenshots with as much detail as possible is always appreciated edit: backtesting for today moved the TP to BE properly

--- 帖子 #449 ---
sigh ok i CAN think of a problem that would lead to TP not moved to BE. Can you give me a screenshot of the account history for today's trades, including the comments column?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Here are the screenshots you requested re the adjusting the stop issue

--- 帖子 #451 ---
hey man, thanks for the screenshots, but i really need the comments column in the accounts history page. right click anywhere on that page and select comments. thanks

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Here they are. I doubt this has anything to do with the issue but I did make the change in the code per your post 329 so orders are not deleted with change in time period of the chart

--- 帖子 #453 ---
i note that your stage 2 orders were not opened while your stage one orders have not hit TP2 yet. Did you by any chance put on the EA, let it place the orders, then for whatever reason, take it off/close your chart/close mt4/change the EA settings before the pending buy order was triggered? Because if you did, the EA no longer tracks the orders and will not do ANYTHING till the next day. As far as it is concerned the pending orders isn't it's problem. This is actually why I put the safeguard to remove pending orders if you remove the EA for any reason. Seeing as you took out that safeguard, is it possible that this is the cause?

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Can anybody pls tell me what is it that am doing thats wrong anytime I input the daily High and low into the calculator it will tell me no trade am i missing anything?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
In any case. I'll try to enable Ea to pick up existing trades in the next patch

--- 帖子 #456 ---
What calculator?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
"Did you by any chance put on the EA, let it place the orders, then for whatever reason, take it off/close your chart/close mt4/change the EA settings before the pending buy order was triggered?" No. I simply attached the EA and did not touch the computer after that. When I awoke, I noted it had placed the initial pending orders, that it hit target 1 but the stop was not changed on lot 2 to breakeven.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Yeah your experts tab reflects what u described. For some reason I think your Ea might be stuck in some loop. I'll check if mine has same problems tmw

--- 帖子 #459 ---

Hello guys, for the first time using this serie of EAs the box was painted correctly and so it shifted from the previous day to the current correctly. However, no pending orders were placed. Can anyone tell me what could go wrong ? DB ? Thank you ! Andrej

--- 帖子 #461 ---
can you run a visual backtest for yesterday's trade and confirm that it doesn't move the SL to BE on TP1? because mine did

--- 帖子 #462 ---
unfortunately I wasn't able to capture today's open properly on my EA because someone disconnected my lan cable in the morning. Did anyone else have this problem?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
This is what I got when I did the same thing. Looks like the strategy's coming out of a multi month drawdown, but it's not as abysmal as you say=)

--- 帖子 #464 ---
No, it did not adjust stop on second lot of today's winning trade when it broke the high.Visual test reflects it reached target 1 after it broke high but did not adjust stop on second lot when it reached target 1

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I have EA v 28 running on FXDD platform where I changed the code so as per your earlier post so it does not remove pending orders if the time period is changed back and forth on chart and it did not adjust stop on 2nd lot. However I also have it running on Interbank platform where EA code was unchanged and it did adjust stop on second lot. So the issue may have something to do with changing the code so pending orders are not eliminated.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Sorry, but I'm confused. According to your screenshot, the platform on which u had the problem was interbank. Yet u say interbank is fine. Did u get the two mixed up? Also, can u run a few days worth of Backtest to see if yesterday was an isolated event, or if it never moves to be on tp1? Btw, while changing that code will prevent removal of orders on changing timeframes, as I mentioned earlier, it will cause the Ea to lose track of current orders, which means not moving the sl to be on tp1. I'm working to fix this "problem" now

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hello DB, I have a good news, at least for me. Untill this point none of your EAs properly worked on my computer. I tried to do one thing. I changed the settings of my clocks on computer from GMT+1 to GMT+2 and suddenly all EAs began to work. v.27 and 28 seem to work properly. Even with negative numbers. Could the time be the issue ? Andrej

--- 帖子 #468 ---
The earlier Interbank screen shots posted that had not adjusted the stop was when I had Version 27 attached with the code changed. I attached Version 28 to Interbank with code unchanged last night and it property readjusted the stop. On the FXDD platform with Version 27 and 28 both with the code changed it did not readjust the stop. Hope that clarifies. I can only check back the last 2 days since I have only had the EA attached and working since you fixed the problem involving getting the fib box to shift at the close of the day and place the pending orders but I will keep checking in the future.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
negative numbers have been fixed for awhile. This is actually bad news, because I spent alot of time trying to make the EA independent on local time(your computer clock time). If changing local time affects how the EA works, I've obviously not been thorough enough. Well, bad news for me, but good news for you I guess=)

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hello DB: Could you make backtest comparative of the EA using the 170 pips range vs atr14? Since 2011 would be great. My broker doesnt offer me historical 1min bars so far. Thanks

--- 帖子 #471 ---
already did if i recall correctly, ATR14 performed better in 2012-present in terms of minimising drawdown and variance while increasing EV, but took less trades, which meant a lower total profit. However if we test from 2010, the ATR14 version reverted to a similar drawdown +variance as the 170pip version. The EV was also slightly lower, while still taking less trades. Based on those tests, I would recommend the 170 pip setting. I've also done tests on the ATR variable, and found that for data 2012-present, the results are similar for values 10-30 but dips quickly if you reduce it below 10, so picking any ATR&gt;10 would apparently give you similar optimal results

--- 帖子 #472 ---

Seems like the market has found a way to beat this EA this year.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
It's supposed to. Recent changes have been made to Monday trading logic though, and the whole thing really is still in beta, so definitely don't put it on live till you're comfortable

--- 帖子 #484 ---

The time function in the code has become overly complicated, and I'll need to rewrite it when I have the time. Can I just confirm with the both of you, that you the screenshots were taken on platforms that were running the EA BEFORE the market opened on sunday/monday? I ask, because I know that there are instances where the box will not draw correctly if applied after the open

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Yes, my platform was opened before market open, I am sure

How to set break even automatically. I mean if the price reaches my first take profit level, then half of the lot size will automatically close and remain half of lot size will be continue till my second target level?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Is there anyway to have a stop-loss function added to this EA? Or have it use the opposite end of the extreme as a stop-loss. Lately, it seems to get stopped out way too early from the whiplash before trending.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
u can change the SL yourself. The EA should not override your changes.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Externally or in the codes?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
on your platform of course. if you change the code, there's nothing i can do to help you

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I was hoping it can be changed externally or coding so that I can run a backtest.

Mine after...

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I don't know if it would be more interesting a semiautomatic EA...introduciing manually the orders, SL's, TP's every night and throwing the EA and it will handle the trade management. A mix between your EA and the "Visual order editor". What do you thing about it? Regards, Nando.

U have the source code, and I have no problem if you wanna muck around and remove functionality to get a semi automatic EA. But that's definitely not going to be the direction I'll be taking in the foreseeable future.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
I'm not coder...it was just an idea....i prefer automatic EA of course, but if it's so complicate maybe you can study anothers options. Regards, Nando.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
deathbait, is there anyway you can add an external stop-loss function for this EA?

--- 帖子 #508 ---
no idea what that is. can u elaborate?

--- 帖子 #510 ---
deathbait -- thanks for the effort. From your experience, is the EA backtesting, in general, reliable and represetiative in MT4? if yes, how is our EA doing in that sense?

I'm running it live on a small account. Been somewhat even so far.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi deathbait...i'm running it live on small account too. I'm having problem with the "Second Entry"...it just placed 1 order once 2 orders. Could you help me? BTW: the monday is a problem for me yet. Thanks in advance for all your work with the EA. Best Regards, Nando.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Nando, please clarify what is the bug you annoyed from? didn't get what you said about "placed 1 order once 2 orders"?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hey guys, sorry for being MIA for so long. Been busy. Anyways, just popping in to let you guys know that I'm aware of some bugs, and I'm trying to fix them without having to rewrite the whole thing. BTW, if you're complaining about problems, and you're using Oanda , your complaint is legit. Oanda is just throwing me errors every day. Been trying to get it to work properly for a week. Problem stems from Oanda implementing limit orders slightly differently.

Running it on a small live account (alpari uk) with fixed lotsizes of 0.01. Last week was the first week i traded it and it was in profit. I will report after a while with results, so you all get a more realistic view of the ea/strategy.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Same here ...

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Wrong ... Your risk should be fixed (I recommend 1%) not your volume. It's very important. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Ok, running version 0.30, I have set "use autolotsize" false. I want it to trade the smallest lotsize for now. (On demo account I have set it to true.) Just want too gain more trust in the ea before I set it to true. But i might change it since you recommand that after a few more days. Riskmultiplier stay at 1. More than enough. One question, do you recommend setting Use Daily ATR for maxrange @ true or false? Thanks for the EA and OP for the strategy!

--- 帖子 #519 ---
using ATR does better on a backtest for this year, but over the last 3 years, it does worse than the fixed 170pips

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Gain trust on demo account, or lower your risk, not your volume. This strategy designed to take advantage of the market when TP2 mostly covers SL. when the risk is not constant, result may vary a lot. usually it will ruin the profitablity of the method. You can set ATR X 1.5 for max range. I dunno the formula DB used. I prefer to set the orders manually. What you see is the basic form of the method, because I change TP2 20% of the times . (Not SL). Sometimes when ranges are so tight (like today) I set one TP @ TP2. I don't bring SL to BE at TP1. In other words I don't do anything when TP1 reached. simple trade with one tp and one sl. but I don't recommend changing the levels if you have lower than 3 years of experience in this business. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #521 ---
The max range will change through time. back in 2007-2008 moving 200 pips in a day was usual, so the number 170 should be changed to adjust to the market properties. In future it will change too, and then I'll update the first post, if I wasn't dead otherwise you should figure it out yourselves !! ( Just kidding ) Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi Basber , I would like to thankyou for posting the system,I have been using it live manually for 2 weeks now (early days I know) and on a demo for a month and it's been working great had a couple of losses but mainly wins. I use on the EUR/USD and on the GBP when I see an inside daily bar. I have been trading for 10 years on and off with little to no success due to my emotions causing me to make stupid trading decisions, however this year I have decided to really try and make it work to a point where i can go full time, and as your system takes the emotion out of trading hopefully it will help me get there. Keep up the good work Cheers Rob

Dear Traders, Deathbait has done a great work coding the EA concerning the Basper's daily breakout system. Surely it blessed many of us in this forum. However, there have also been some suggestion to create semiautomated EA and make it more simple for those traders who find it more convenient for them. I asked a friend of mine, explained him the system and he coded the semiautomated EA which I'm attaching. It's the first version and there are both advantages and disadvantages to it. Possibly few bugs as well. It might be improved in the future, at the moment, however, it's very simple. Parameters: High: Manually input the high of the previous day. Low: Manually input the low of the previous day. Lots: Input fixed volume of lots. entry_pips_diff: Number of pips the price must exceed high/low for 1st trigger sl_pips_diff: Number of pips the SL is place bellow/above the Fib line expire_in_hours = number of hours pending orders are to last Advantages: You can apply EA any time. I do it in the morning as most of the time the high/low of the previous day wasn't triggered yet. Unlike the DB's EA you can do it retrospectively. Disadvantages: Limited parameters inputs. and Very important !: Once you attach the EA to the chart, you can't switch between timeframes, nor close and open MT4 because EA will set the pending orders anew and anew and you can end up having hundreds of pending orders. You you'd better to set apart one window for your currency pair which just won't be modified. In case you get hundreds of pending orders and you want a quick way to delete them automatically, I also attach another EA which will do that for you. Ok guys, I hope it helps anyone. Good luck and GBY ! P.S: Deathbait, if you'd like you can modify this EA and make it better ;-)

Hi Basber First I'd like to say big thank you for sharing your system and taking time and putting your effort to reply to most of the questions in this thread. I'm a newbie and I am not sure whether this has been asked before. My first question is what is the reason behind market usually changes its behaviour through 4 year time cycle. Why not 2 or 3 years? My second question. From your personal experience, how do you know when a trading system is not working anymore or it's time to edit its rules? Do we wait till we have 2 or 3 consecutive lossing months?

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hello Basper, I have a question. In case an inside bar occurs after a mother bar, it seems more logical to me to count the levels based on the mother bar(2 days before), not the previous day's bar. Am I right ? :-)

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hey where d you get that DB cal software from?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi, at first I want to thank Basber for this really nice trading system! I saw someone coded an indicator for this trading system. But I decided to code my own one 'cause I need some special features and want to support more timeframes in future versions. The current version will only work in the H1 timeframe. It can create a forecast for the next day (you need to enable chart shifting for this). Available settings are: - StartHour is the hour of the day that is used to start the calculation - Forecast will enable or disable the forecast painting (disabling will save some CPU ressources because it won't repaint with every tick) - TP is the Fibo level for the take profit lines (lime) - SL is the Fibo level for the stop loss lines (red) - BE is the Fibo level for the break even lines (white dashed) - EntryPips is the number of pips to place the entry lines (yellow) over/under the high/low of the previous period - StopPips is the number of pips to place the stop loss lines under/over the stop loss levels - OnePip is the size of one pip at the used currency pair (change this to 0.01 for USDJPY for example) I tryed to include the rules exactly, especially the rule to combine sunday with monday high/low values. For me it works, but I can't test the sunday+monday rule 'cause FinFx charts are starting with monday... The 50% Fibo level is missing because I already use 8 buffers for painting - the maximum in MQL4. This are my 50 cents for this thread, I hope someone could use it!

Hi guys. I have a lot of experience on horizontal line trading. Consider this: - backtesting BE is almost impossible. A candle is a period of time when price can go up and down and down and up... You just don't know. So, if you put an horizontal line, let's just say, on the middle of the candle you cannot assume that the price came down (ex) and continue down (downtrend) and made lots of pips and never touched the BE line. Be careful with the backtest using horizontal lines.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hi luis, for a real backtest I always code an EA and use tick data. For a visual backtest I count the worst case, if it's not sure how the price moved during a candle. A good example is the 10am MEZ candle from the ESM decision: The candle is very big, it moved over the SL and BE lines. But from the hourly chart you can't see what really happened. Did the price went up to the BE and then down to the SL? In a visual backtest I would count at minimum two losses for this bar: The entry was touched, then the SL -&gt; 2nd entry, then back to the 1st entry (SL of the 2nd entry) and then the BE line to stop the trade by going back to the break even stop loss. But in fact there was a lot more movement (I scalped it and got &gt;+180 pips for today ). A visual backtest is not enough for being sure about the profitability of this kind of trading system. At the end to be sure you have to code an EA for doing a backtest with (high quality!) tick data. Currently I'm trying this system in a Demo account, just for the feeling (feels ok since now ). You may use the EA that was posted earlier for a backtest - I didn't do it yet. Bye, nd

Hi guys, this is my first post on this thread.I have been reading through it for a while now and would like to try it out,unfortunately it is impossible for me to be at my PC all day or leave it running.I am thinking of trying to run the EA through a VPS(virtual private server) on a demo for a while.Just wondered if anybody has any experience in doing this.Any advice would be most welcome. Thanks

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I've tested this on M15 and the condition you discribed happens rarely. When testing, the candles that you described, I considered them all as SL. But you're right. That's why all my posts on this method are in M15. M5 is a little annoying .. Traders should not backtest this on higher TFs, because of the reason you told ... Thanks for bringing it up. People, if you want to succeed in this business, when you approach a method, either you designed it or you heard it from somewhere (like here), try your best to disapprove it . If you fail, you've find your perfect method. This point is crucial, easy to understand, but hard to do it in action ... Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I don't like EAs. I rather to place orders myself, because sometimes I change the target levels. Why don't you try to manage your account from your phone ? Regards, Basber

Hi Nando, I'm following this thread for some time and I read all your posts. I think there was a sort of change in your strategy or trading plan after September 2011. If you don't mind, could you explain what happened? You were making good profit out of the trades before September 2011 and after that?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi Ryu, You're quite welcome. The 4 year thing is a rule of thumb. The observation shows market change it's behaviour every 3-5 years. The reason may be the political cycles which last about these number of years. But I'm not sure. Thanks for bringing up the second question. I think it's very important to know when to adjust the system. The thing you mentioned is an alert, but not the only factor. The most important factor is seeing a pattern in your losses . For instant, I traded a method years ago which would targeted more than 150 pips per trade with around 100 pips for SL. After few years we saw draw downs. When we analysed our trades we saw that many of them move in desirable direction for 70 - 80 pips then reverses. Also we concluded SLs could be smaller. So we tightened both SL and TP and the method become profitable again. Notice that the main concept of the method should remain solid. Usually the details will change. That's why I insist on not following everything blindly, because then traders can't adjust the method to market themselves and they are always dependet to someone else. I hope it helped. And also sorry for the late response. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Backtest 1-2 years before trading it on real account. Also on more volatile markets, you can take more TP. While backtesting, search for better SL and TP levels. I prefer that you work more one TPs than SL. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Both approaches have either pros and cons. When you widen your SL to what you called mother bar, assuming the constant risk for every trade, your volume will be smaller, so market should move more in your trade's direction to give you the desired profit. But in other hand your trade is safer. I act different on different situation. For example when I'm hunting for small TPs, such as this method's targets, I usually use the inside bar itself, but when I'm targeting larger targets for my TP, I usually use the mother bar for SL levels. It's not about right or wrong sometimes, it's about how you feel more comfortable while trading. Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Thank you for your reply, Basber. That's a very good explanation.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hi, Monday has always been and will always be a special day (no news, lack of volatility). Friday too ("pressure" for closing orders before the week-end), but not in the same manner. Every strategy must consider them separatly. You can build a strategy especially for mondays that don't work the other days... the reverse is true too.

Hi Basber! Just want to say... Thank you! That's a good strategy ! I Like it

Hello Basber, thank you for your reply concerning mother bar/ inside bar and sorry for misspelling :-0. Basber, I've been recently using your system live and I'm glad that it really works ! I have two more questions. Has anyone so far reliably backtested it for more than 3 years to see if the gains are constant ? I really wonder how you came up with this particular fib. levels. I mean distance between each other. Is it your secret ? :-) I'm asking because I'd like to create some kind of EA where even these parameters would be able to be optimized to see the best results. Could I get any help from you ? What do you think about setting the levels not upon fixed pecentage of a previous day range but rather the S/R levels that occured "yesterday" ?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
What does that mean?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi DB Care to share any results? Thanks

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Thanks!!! It's a great idea. Does it work with 2nd order too? Best regards, Nando.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
I've checked it... It works for 2nd order fine, but it don't move the SL @ be after TP1 is reached... Does it work fine for you? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hello Nando, meantime, we updated the version cause there might have been some bug, so I'm attaching the correct one. Yes, it works exactly the way it should, however, there's one problem. The computer must be on (no saving mode) all the time. If TP is reached while your computer is sleeping, the EA won't move the SL. Otherwise it should work fine. It's just the same with second entries. Your comp. can't be in a saving mode when Entry 1 is hit. Otherwise, Entry 2 won't be set. Does it make sense to you ? :-) Btw, I honestly think that second entries are not that reliable and successful. Now I'd trade only first entries and then when my SL is hit. I'd set another Entry 1. It's just my observation, no serious research :-) Sorry for anwering so late

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Thanks mate. No prob for late answering. Regards, Nando.

Hello basber , are you still profitable using this method ? Im asking because almost all of the breakout systems in the forum seem to not work after some times according to their OP so Im wondering about yours.Any info on this will be appreciated .Thanks Metta

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi Metta, Yes, I'm still doing fine. I must emphasize that I share the main idea. You can optimize it. I recommend working on TP2 for better result. But I think even basic version of the strategy which is shared here, was doing fine. You can test it yourself. It don't take that much time. Regards, Basber

To all involved in this thread, and especially Basper: Thank you for your generous sharing of information, concepts and EA's. Question: What would results look like if we traded 3% risk on each trade instead of 1%. Since this is a positive expectation method. (aren't they all) we should get a positive result. Anyone got a year's worth of back test specifics that I can experiment with on an Excel sheet? I would be happy to share the results with the group. Many thanks Tim.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Besper, Quick question: at the beginning of your thread you mentiond DBCal. Is this a backtesting program? Do you have a link to DB Cal? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi there, Could my reasoning be confirmed here. This is how I understand the system. Today, a bad day for trades. Entry that immediately went to Stop Loss. We renter for a sell on the SL line and, bang, it stops out again. No other entries for the day. Is this correct? Am I understanding the system correctly. (I suppose its good to consider the worst case scenario in any trading system. So long as the positive edge holds we can live with days like this.) Many thanks in advance. Tim.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi Basber! Very interesting to see someone has the similar system to mine. I used to trade this system in last year. Now i have already stopped using it because i am looking for more potential outcome. Indeed, this system works well because i had backtest it for 8 years. And the crucial things is this system is simple, able to discipline yourself and have the free time to do other stuffs. So i would like to attach some of my statistical analysis here to provide you the useful evidences of how the market moves. To tell my story in short, i have created my own analysis system to prove and understand the market behaviour, and this thread system is exactly based on my finding. From the statistic report, i understand that where should be the right target and stop loss (High probability area). Now i have another system that i need to focus with, is the combination of this system with trend and S/R range. Know this could be an better edge. So i think we could work together to maximize the potential of this system. If you need other statistical data or discuss something else. Please PM me. Statistical Report Explanation This analysis is the relationship for today and yesterday. Type of analysis: Trending and ranging Analysis period: Jan 2004 to Dec 2011 (8 Years) Daily Timing : GMT 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 Total candlestick bars: 2083 (2083 daily bars) Fibonacci 0% : Yesterday lowest price Fibonacci 100% : Yesterday highest price Horizontal value: Fibonacci 0 to 100% Vertical value: Extension high and low price position (Trending), open price position (Ranging) Please look at picture for other info. Thanks.

Welcome to the thread Tim Here are the replies .. : 3% risk will increase your drawdown. But afterall, what was given here was the basics. It's a rule of thumb for beginning. Although I don't recommend risking over 2% on any trade from any method, you can change the risk. But before that trade well with method to grasp it concepts so you can personalize it, or you can have an accurate backtest. It's not a backtesting program. It's a visual basic written program by me that I use myself for calculation of the levels. It's designed for 2 pip spread for EU. You still had the sell order for first entry and if triggered and not reached TP2 and reached SL are (the sell from first entry), buy from second entry will trigger. Worst case for this method is 4SLs in a day and best result is 4TP1 and 2TP2 for a day. Other things you described was right. P.S. : Read the first post more accurately. Thanks Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi BB, Thanks for sharing I'm too using S&amp;R zones and Trends for setting TP2 sometimes. I combine another method that I have with this one which increased the profitablity. I have 4 methods that I trade with. Two of them on Daily TF and other half on M15. (I consider this system as M15 method). Why don't you trade both your methods ? Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi Basper, Thanks for your explanation. So after the 4 stop losses, we re-enter long and ride all the way to TP2? I understand the losses, but I am still struggling to see how you get 4TP1 and 2TP2 for the day. From what I understand, after the losses, we re-enter for long on the ENTRY line and ride all the way to TP2? Could you kindly mark them on the chart for me. Sometimes it is clearer than written language. I thank you for your patience in advance, Tim.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
I won't risk twice for the similar systems. So an idea has came to my mind that one system could combine with many sub systems, such as applying system A when market is trending, system B if ranging, system C if breakout and so on.... From my past experience, sometimes stand alone system performs bad result and cause unnecessary draw down temporary. Although we could diversify the risk by trading multiple systems and instruments. However, i prefer one system to dominate all systems without risking twice or catch the same movement. One thing need your advice, does TP2 method works? For my current focusing system, I use previous closing price position to determine my current day trade, if price is ranging i enter, if price is breakout i enter and cancel the ranging order, if price is choppy i enter because i don't know and it doesn't matter of losing some since i look for highest price(Short) or lowest price(Long) of the day. Thanks.

Here is my little contribution to this wonderful thread: Copy/Paste the attached Position Size indicator into your MT4 Indicators file. Open MT4... enter the parameters for (a) your entry and (b) your stop loss and (c) the percentage you are willing to risk on each trade. Voila... it spits out how many lots (or mini-lots) you should be willing to put on each trade. Wonderful time-saving tool.

Hi Basper, I would like to know how you deal with trading the system in the face of news announcements. How do you deal with widening spreads ? Which news announcements do you take particular note of (if any)? Do you strictly not trade after the end of the NY session? Or is this a matter of discretion? As usual, many thanks in advance. Tim.

Hi Basper and any other experienced system users. Please could you check my logic for Friday's trade? Many thanks. Tim.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
It has been a week since your post so I thought I would make a comment. I'm sure Basber won't mind. Good trending behaviour is not usually expected on a Friday and especially not on the last day of a month. Many large positions are closed on these days and this can be a cause of the whipsaws you have encountered. Your entries don't seem quite right to me on your chart but I have not read the whole thread so I can't really comment on that. Perhaps someone else can.

Hi Tim, When high impact news is going to hit the market, a) If I'm in market and in profit, I will set SL @ BE ; b) In market &amp; negative, set TP @ BE ; c) remove the orders if not in market. It depends which news is important. News like jobs or interest rates or etc. usually hits the market significantly. Sometimes announcements from central banks hit the market and sometimes GDP. It depends what market is waiting for. It's better to ignore it if you are new to trading. But if you want to be a professional, you should know what's happening around the globe. It will maximize your profitibility. I usually read the reuters and bloomberg news and decide whether a particular news is important or not, beside the regular high impact news. I usually remove my orders at the end of NY session. If a trade is open, I'll leave it to be the way it was. Hope it was helpful Regards, Basber

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi, First off, I've got to apologise. I can no longer support the EA. Someone offered to pay me a couple of months back to modify the EA to his preferences, and I took a serious long and honest look at it and found a couple of problems with it that was caused by the casual way I wrote it at the beginning. Patching out bugs and logic errors just compounded the problem, and it's now a mess. Workable yes, but still a mess. I came to the conclusion I would need to rewrite it from scratch, but then some personal stuff crept up on me and so it remains as one of the many half written EAs in my dev folder. I do hope one day to finish the rewrite, but it won't be soon. As such, I'm caught in the middle : unable to provide and updated copy, and no longer familiar enough with the old EA to give advice or do a quick bugfix. For those of you who are wondering, yes I've been running the last version of the old EA live on one of my older accounts, and no it has not been making money in the last few months. I wonder if Basber has had better results?

This is one of the most accurate and simplest strategies that any trader can use for one of his long term portfolio. Compound your profits and you'll be successful in a couple of years . You can imagine that if you were to start with $1000 and compound at 1% return everyday using this same strategy , You would hit one Billion dollars in not a century or a decade but only 5 years and 4 months . Trading and being successful is not easy but is simple if you don't let your primal instincts kick in . ​

Hello Basber, Thank you for your post....the Fib system and the EA. I'm currently testing the EA on a demo now. However, it doesnt seem like the EA enters Second Trades! Yesterday I used this EA and found out it did not enter Second trade after the Buy trade was triggered. Again, my broker is a 5-digit broker, so I had to adjust by adding zeros to Pip difference. Has there been any major changes since then in your EA? What about the second trades?
