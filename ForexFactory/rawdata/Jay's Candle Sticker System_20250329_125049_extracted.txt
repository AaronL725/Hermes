I must confess. I have been making bank with a discretionary trading system. It may not work for you but here it goes. I buy on confirmed bullish candlestick patterns, and I sell on confirmed bearish candlestick formations. Currently, when a trade reaches 100 pips of profit, I add another position in the same direction with half the initial lot size. If the position garners another 100 pips of profit, I add another lot which is a quarter the size of the initial lot size. I close a position when and if it closes beyond a stop-loss or a confirmed candlestick pattern in the opposite direction appears. Stop losses are not placed with the broker since with my system the position must close at the end of the day beyond the stop-loss, not merely hit it. All decisions about buying and selling are made once a day sometime after the formation of new candles usually sometime between 5 pm - 6 pm eastern. Stop losses are generated naturally from the candlestick position traded. See https://www.candlesticker.com . I also have an account with AmericanBulls.com which informs me at to which candlestick formations have been confirmed , an account is not needed to get this information. A confirmed candlestick pattern is a pattern in which the close is above the signal line on a bullish pattern or below the signal line on a bearish pattern. Currently, I only deal with daily candles. After being a losing trading for over ten years my epiphany occurred in late January 2018 after I read " The Consistent Trader " by Sam Eder. I don't get any referral fees from the links, I put them there because they are what works for me. It is my goal to create a system that just takes 15 minutes a day away from living life. Then create an expert advisor that automates it. So that I can play video games all day long and be a philanthropist. p.s. Due to conversations with my girlfriend if the account ever doubles again in a 24hour period I am to close all positions. I quit using the girlfriend rule. It sounds cute but when enacted it destroys your momentum, why sell everything when you are winning this rule is too arbitrary. Updated 6/6/18 so trades opened before this date utilize my old system of 0.25-0.5-1 lotsizes where now I use 1-0.5-0.25. Lot sizes are your choice of course and you are welcome to use any money management scheme you like. I use a 0.5 lot order with take-profit at 1ATR(14), along with a 0.25 lot size with take-profit at 2*ATR(14), and also a final 0.25 lot order with no set take profit the exit is by opposite pattern confirmation or stop-loss. skip Important new updates to the system in post #114 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11150945#post11150945 The most recent update to the system. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11169897#post11169897 TLDR; I update a spreadsheet every day with the free signals from American Bulls forex " A. POPULAR " sheet. I place buy orders for all BUY signals, I close all SELL signals and I open a sell order for all SHORT signals.

Can you elaborate more how you take trade with some examples. Looks interesting. please tellme how to use candlesticker? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Sure, I'll post some examples after 5 pm eastern if I get any valid trades today. Essentially http://www.candlesticker.com teaches you how to recognize 84 different candlestick patterns. Once you see one of the patterns on your chart you can then initiate your trades. That's the free way to use the system, however for a fee you could join http://americanbulls.com and be informed of candlestick patterns that they automatically detect. In the long term, I plan to create an expert advisor that detects all 84 patterns and trades appropriately.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Well, I just checked the candlesticks on the forex pairs that I trade and unfortunately, no new candle formations were confirmed so my system simply states to hold all current positions until 5 pm tomorrow, hopefully, I'll get an example for you tomorrow. On the bright side, I don't have to worry about doing anything so I'm going to go to a concert with my gf. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Subscribed. Thanks for the book and the link!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi Jay, i subscribed already, i do like to ask though, u trade you trade on the daily time frame, and you still close your trades at the end of day.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Technically I process my trades after the end of the day when the new candlesticks appear and I have new information to base my trading decisions on. This happens for me just after 5 pm eastern. I typically don't shut down my trade unless it closes beyond a stop loss or I detect a confirmed candlestick pattern going in the opposite direction of the current open position. I don't close my trades every day like a day trader, I could hold a position for days, or weeks, I don't have any self-prescribed limit on how long I hold a position.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
yea keep dreaming cheers

--- 帖子 #9 ---
What the book really showed me is that every person needs to develop their own system for themselves, something with which they are personally confident. That is one of the reasons why I have no qualms showing my system. Unless your trading psychology is like mine, then it probably will not work for you, and that's ok. The dream is alive! https://www.amazon.com/gp/review/RZC...at_pdctrvw_srp

--- 帖子 #10 ---
What timeframe you use usually to find candlestick pattern?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Jay! Your are so great when sharing these ideas with us. I also losing till now and finally see some light when view your style of trading! I really hope to get your own advise in trades and money management. Could I have your email in my inbox just to get some specific advise? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I exclusivly use daily candlesticks at the moment.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
not much to say except Well Done.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Well, it looks like you may be too new for me to be able to send a private message to or there is some other reason why I cannot figure out how to message you directly. Why don't you go ahead and post your question for the world to see, I don't believe in scarcity and there really is no point to secrecy. Alternatively, you could send me a message directly from my profile, that goes to my email. I would post my email, but I don't want spam from forum email scraper bots.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Very, very nice Jay! You Da Man! Just always remember... Bulls make money... Bears make money &amp; pigs get slaughtered. G

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Subscribed Been waiting for this and thanks for the links it's definitely a great asset in trading candle stick patterns

--- 帖子 #17 ---
okay, nice,however.it seems you take a lot of trades despite being on the daily time frame,hope to see you post some trades in here...

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I do plan on posting some trades, each signal is essentially three trades, one is immediate and then I place two corresponding pending orders. It should become more clear when I actually place some live trades later. Pending orders can activate anytime and I don't need to be on my computer for them to work. Specifically, if I place a buy order then I will place two buy stops one 100 pips away from the initial position and another 200 pips, for sell orders, I place sell stops. This can show up as intraday activity, but it is set up just after the formation of the new candles and is activated without my involvement.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Nice, will be expecting, however, i am still wondering how you are able to be on 91% up this week, using daily time frame, please can you throw more light n this, what size, e.t.c do you use per trade,and do you, and what broker do you use, the reason for asking is because of swaps, i am wondering what swaps will turn into holding a trade for a week...

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Ok so now I am wondering, can you see my trade explorer most of the information you asked for is right there ready for you to take a look. So are you asking me to repeat the information that is there into a forum post? Or maybe you asked this question before you realized that you already have access to the information? I have everything set to public so all the info should be there. As far as swaps go, with my broker the fees are nominal and I generally just ignore their effects.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
JayDavid, can you post a screen shot on one of ur swing trades where u adding a position every 100 pips? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Jay, i am trying to understand this, from what i gathered, as soon as you have your signal for entry on daily, say a buy signal on g/u 1.3400, you will set a pending order for half the size used after the first 100 pips, in essence, market order at 1.3400, then set pending order at 1.3500 and also 1.3600....the goes on till there is a confirmed exit.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Yes Jay, i see, it, the thing is, i am used to using percentage per trade, say i want to pick a trade, i do use say the last swing or low to calculate to give the 2% or whatever the case maybe,it seems you do not trade that way, or maybe i cant not decipher this, hence i was wonering what percentage you use per trade to be up about 90% on a daily time frame within a week...sorry if i sound like a broken record, i just want to make sure i understand as against thinking i understand.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thanks for reply Jay! Just add your Twister, and shout to you but don't know how to send direct message to your profile! anyway, I will contact you via Twister. Nice day!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
That is essentially it, I would place a market order on g/u at whatever the price happens to be trading at while I am looking at it and then place the pending orders 100 and 200 pips away from whatever price was executed. --Now I did recently change my trading procedure to take on more risk initially. Last month was an exciting time and the account reached 20K but I was not able to keep most of it due to the inevitable corrections and retracements that naturally occur. So currently the orders were placed with an initial lot size of 0.25 then a pending order is set for 0.5 and 1.0 that was how it was done. On June 6th I decided to reverse that procedure and make the initial order be 1.0 and then the pending orders will be of size 0.5 and 0.25. I found that I usually made money on my initial position, but losses racked up with my addon positons when reversals occurred, so this new method should ease some of the pain of going through corrections.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Yeah, I used to trade this way using percentages, back when I found it difficult to make any money trading. I initially started my system trading 2% of equity but I found myself meandering at the same spot, not losing much but also not winning much. Most of the time I was looking at losses in my account hoping for a recovery. Using percentages limited my losses, but also my gains. During the course of this pedantic percentage system, I made a mistake and fat fingered a lot size that was much larger than what it was supposed to be. That trade ended up being very profitable so I continued the system and threw away the percentages. They are not for me at the moment.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
It the top middle of the profile view there should reside a message button, use that to send direct messages. Did you mean twitter? @512jay

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I noticed this, when i checked your trades, the new way is better in my opinion, however, i am thinking of something, you use a flat out 100 pips, is it possible to use the daily range of the currency as against 100 pips, the reason is some pairs just have a low daily range..i.e the likes of aud/usd, which is around 60 pips, if you use 100pips, then that is close to the weekly range of such pair, however, using 100 pips will be fine on a pair like g/u and it will be noting on pair like g/j...just my thought...what your say on this.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
....[/b] lol....i see, maybe i will join you on this journey of ditching percentage for now.....

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I like it and this is why I wanted to run my system through the crucible of public opinion. To improve it, and that probably will be an improvement. I'm thinking maybe an ATR(14) would work, especially when turned into an expert advisor. The method I use now is very easy for a manual trader who does not want to do much math.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
This will happen probably later today if I get any valid trades check back after 6 pm eastern.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yeap...even if you use the average true range,it is still easy.....

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Looks like a great system.. American Bulls like like a stock trading deal. Forex might be a sideline?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Yes, I added that Twister, is it your Twister?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Yeah, it seems as though they added forex as an afterthought. Even though they treat it like a stepchild it still has some viability.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) LOL, its like you can't type twitter. Yes, @512Jay is my twitter. I can't message myself so here is a test subject.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Just curious, how would you go about calculating the daily range of the currency?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
There are different indicators on forexfactory that can be used to calculate the daily range, usually you will be the one to set the parameters, as it will take the range for a number of days which u like,then average it out, the average is what u will use to set you ADR...

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Do you use any other indicator, or just use candlestick pattern? And how to determine stop-loss level?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
search for ADR(average daily range) online. Most of them set at default at 14 days average.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I don't use any other indicators. I don't place any stop losses on my trades with the broker. However, I do still use stop losses. When trading a candlestick formation a stop loss is naturally generated. Check out candlesticker.com I note it and if a trade closes beyond a stop loss I will close it. This allows that throughout the course of a day a trade can travel beyond the stop loss without it closing as long as it recovers by the end of the day. I find that this gives me more flexibility.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Nice strategy! Can I ask why are you using realtrader as a broker? http://www.forexpeacearmy.com/forex-...realtrader.org

--- 帖子 #43 ---
They don't care that I am an American and I can get access to leverage that I cannot get here in the United States. I'm open to further suggestions. I remember trading before Frank Dodd went into effect, it was a heady time, now American brokers are so restricted that many strategies just won't work and most foreign brokers will not accept us as clients. The American government regulated us into safe secure losses, no hedging, crappy leverage. Also, I have been trading with them for 7+ years so inertia. I have actually withdrawn money in the past, but not substantial sums. I use multiple brokers to address the risk of not being able to get my withdrawals. Have you personally had a bad experience with them?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I try to analyze your open orders. Did you make an entry on EUR/JPY because there is bullish piercing line candlestick on D1 chart like this picture? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Nope my buy order is the result of a Bullish Harami on 5/30/18, however, due to the vagaries of brokers, you could be looking at the same or similar trade. 05/30/2018 BULLISH HARAMI Buy Level 126.9900 Stop Loss 124.5800 Execution at 127.258 Attached Image I obviously need to work on my graphics work. Ignore the stop loss and sell level currently on the chart that is for a Bearish Hanging Man that formed on the 5th. You know what's sad is that I actually added a note to a bunch of those orders in the forex factory notes section to indicate what pattern triggered them, but I don't see any of the notes now. I guess that was a waste of time. Here is a screen print from my MetaTrader 4.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
84 * 28 = 2352 possibilities, how do you manage this every day?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Ok, it's after 5 pm Eastern and I have checked for candlestick patterns I have one valid trade. EURAUD formed a Bullish Piercing Line on 6/5/18 which confirmed today. Buy Level 1.5377 Stop Loss 1.5273 Execution at 1.54767 Before I can initiate this buy order I need to close the currently open sell order on EURAUD. I closed that order and suffered a loss of $364.36. I also cancel the two pending sell-stop orders that never triggered. Now according to my system, I open a 1 lot buy trade on EURAUD at the market price of 1.54767. I also opened two pending buy-stop orders. One for 0.5 lots at 1.55767 and another for 0.25 lots at 1.56767. Now I am done... Attached Image (click to enlarge) I know it kinda sucks to show a losing trade as my first trade, but that's the way the cookie crumbled.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
With the magic of software americanbulls.com just tells me which candlestick have formed and what is confirmed. Makes my analysis a simple daily glance. Here is the free link. https://www.americanbulls.com/SignalListFX.aspx?lang=en Since I found that so valuable I now pay for their service and that gets me the buy and sell levels along with the stop-loss. I simply transcribe this information into a google sheet that I update daily.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Which broker does americanbulls use? I use oanda and there is no such pattern for today on euraud daily. But there was a bullish harami 2 days ago. I couldve entered earlier at a better price of 1.5388

--- 帖子 #50 ---
You know, I don't know where they are getting their data from. Taking a second look at your chart I do see the Bullish Piercing Line on the chart and even your bullish harami would not have confirmed until today. I consider a confirmed candlestick pattern, not one whereby the pattern merely forms but the pair has to close beyond the pattern in the correct direction. Intraday movement does not count. So let's say we were considering your Bullish Harami from two days ago, I would not take the trade until after a bullish candle closed above the pattern. I'm not actually trying to get the top or bottom I just want to be in the trade when it has a high chance of going my way, and it has somewhat proven it by traveling in the direction that I want it to go some already.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
The funny but good thing about this system is that technically my weekend has started! I can't make any more trades according to my system until the market opens back up Sunday. I could shutdown MetaTrader right now, go enjoy my life and worry about what's happening here on Sunday evening.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
If it goes to the 200pips do you add another order 100 again? I mean when do you take the profits/close

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #54 ---
The pending orders are already set I just leave them to work their magic by themselves. If I get the signal to close an order I close all of the associated orders for that pair at the same time. So if a pair has two open orders and one pending when I get the signal to close the order I will close both open orders and delete the pending order. I can get the signal to close an order in two main ways. I close a position when and if it closes beyond a stop-loss or a confirmed candlestick pattern in the opposite direction appears. That's it. Also, since last month due to conversations with my girlfriend if my account doubles in one 24 hour period, I am to close all positions.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Looking good, however, I actually would not place the stop-loss on the chart, unless that just a reminder line. Hopefully, this is a demo? You never know with trades.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Its not actually a piercing pattern on my chart because the market didnt gap down, the close of the bearish candle and the open of the bullish candle are same. But than again i rarely see a gap on my charts for some reason, maybe there is a setting on the platform. Anyway like u said if you wait for candle to close above/below the signal line for confirm. than todays trade is valid. I dont want to complicate things but there is a thread on the forum i think its called 3 candles or something, that enters trades at pullbacks after signal confirmation using fibo, this is all for cheaper price entry thus reducing sl distance.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks, Its demo only and I only added 0.1lots even with that lol. On my platform 1 lot if it gets stopped in this trade it's &gt;£1000 loss. Bit scary that for a £10000 account.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Ok, so the second day did not gap down so no Bullish Piercing Line, it is hard to eyeball from a chart. I agree we are looking a basically the same trade. I'll look around for the pullback stuff. I am definitely open to any improvements. In the past I have found that hunting for tops and bottoms were a fool's errand, I was rarely successful and when I was the net extra gain was marginal. I've got a list of potential improvements forming already. 1. Utilizing dynamic addon spacing like ATR to plan pending orders. 2. Figure out some way to obtain better entry points.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Yes , for example open a trade of 1/2 lot when candle closes confirming pattern. Place 1 lot at a determined pullback area, and set a stop order of .25 lot at a determined future area, all sl placed at same price. There was actually an ea called double in a day or something that utilized this, basicaly it used positive positiond to open new trades, whilst keeping your overall equity protected. Basically if price moved your way significantly it theoretically doubled your account in a day.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I like it, one could look at the chart and see if there are any easily identified support and resistance levels. Or, maybe go back like 50% towards the stop-loss level to initiate the 1 lot size order and the same distance in the other direction to place the 0.25 lot order. I have the add-ons because I wanted to add to my winners. In the past, I would only trade one position per pair, which left a lot of winnings on the table and the wins were commensurate with the losses. With add-ons, I win more when I win and lose about the same with my losses unless there are major reversals.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Jay i have question about americanbulls. Do they only give signals at 5.pm eastern ny everyday? Or do the signals change intraday if price goes completly the opposite way during day?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Once a day 5 pm eastern. They have a way of looking at possible confirmations intraday, but what really matters is how the trade closes at the end of the day. I have been burnt a few times chasing intraday signals to try and get a better entry, only to find out at the end of the day that the entry never triggered and now I am in a trade that I should not be in. They give temporary confirmations intraday, risky!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hey Jay! Quite an interesting system you have here. Once I can figure out how to subscribe to a thread... YOU my friend will be my first subscription! LOL! Checking out the American Bull site, I see this signal called "stay in cash" without any short or long implications. I was curious about that expression as it must be some stock trading lingo and I am purely forex oriented. One more thing, I also see MANY different currency pairs (some EXTREMELY exotic) yet many common pairs seem to be missing like... AUDCHF, AUDNZD, GBPCAD etc. Perhaps that just means there is no signal, however, since they include the signals "stay long" and "stay short" it would almost seem as if you would constantly be either short or long at any given time. Hope I was clear with my query. Sorry mate, I don't engage much in forums but, you have certainly piqued my curiosity. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Glad you are piqued. Yeah, I agree I am basically taking a stock trading system and pigeonholing it into a forex trading system. So, stay in cash would result if you hit your stop-loss since there would not be a corresponding opposite candlestick pattern to place a trade with. Also, bear in mind that this is a stock trading system and stock-guys have some type of complex surround going short so there is some added obtuseness with sell orders from American bulls . If you were in a sell order and a confirmed bullish pattern happens instructions are to close your sell and open up a buy. However, if you are in a long position and a confirmed bearish pattern happens their instructions are to simply close your position and stay in cash . That actually tripped me up a few times, they have a go short signal that would garner the behavior whereby you would close the long and place a sell(short). So, for bearish candles, they have a sell signal and a go short signal however only just a buy for bullish signals. If you are currently in cash and a sell or short signal comes along, place a sell. I know it is confusing and it took me a while to figure it out. Apparently, stocks have a bullish bias. Yes, they are missing many pairs, since I am pretty lazy I just don't trade those pairs. I also stay away from the exotics. I tried BitCoin and the metals for a while, but since I am copying my trades across multiple brokers I decided to keep it simple and exclude them since all the brokers do not trade the exotics. Once, I get the expert advisor going, it will not matter which chart I attach it to.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanks Jay, that does clear things up. They do offer signals though for all of the other currency pairs that are NOT currently displayed on their signal board, right? I mean, sooner or later there will be a signal come up for pairs not listed like AUDCHF?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Nope, what you see is what they have and that is it.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
...and here's an open question to ANYONE on here... How the heck does one subscribe to a thread?! I've even googled it and haven't found the answer! Sheesh! LOL

Why you not placing actual stop loss on the chart?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
smart girl ... I like her already

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Stop losses are not placed with the broker since with my system the position must close at the end of the day beyond the stop-loss, not merely hit it. I don't place any stop losses on my trades. However, I do still use stop losses. When trading a candlestick formation a stop is naturally generated. Check out candlesticker.com I note it and if a trade closes at the end of the day beyond a stop loss I will close it. This allows that throughout the course of a day a trade can travel beyond the stop loss without it closing as long as it recovers by the end of the day. I find that this gives me more flexibility.

Yeah, she is awesome. I call that the girlfriend rule.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
What's the leverage on each trade? For example on $10000 account what position size?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I have not done that type of calculation I have chosen a lot size which I use for all positions. This causes the leverage for each trade to be different. I have chosen 1 whole lot, a half of a lot, and a quarter lot. Although I did initially start by using 2% as you probably saw on the spreadsheet attached to my daily trade. The common acceptable trading theory now in vogue would suggest you use a 2% of equity lot size, based on your proposed stop loss, but I have just ignored that advice since in the past it basically just kept me where I was at. I kind of think of it as tiers, if perchance my account grows to 30K, I'll adjust my lot sizes. I actually plan on making them smaller to reduce risk and make the system less risky and more sustainable over time. At this moment in time, this system is slated for high risk, high reward. To get started you could probably generate a range to chose a lot size from by generating the lot size for 2% risk for a few positions and then standardize somewhere in the middle. Sorry for getting into the weeds, please ignore if you already know how to calculate lot sizes based off of percentages: Not to belabor the point, but if you had a $10,000 account and you wanted to use 2% risk. You would pick a lot size that would lose about $200 if it hit the stop loss, depending upon the value for each pip and the number of pips to your stop loss, the lot size would vary with each currency pair. So for example, if you were trading EURUSD and the stop loss happened to be set at 100 pips and the value of 1 pip of movement for a standard lot size was $10. Your lot size would be (0.2) or 20% of a lot which equates to $2 per pip and since there are 100 possible pips if you hit your stop loss you would lose the amount you could deal with. I currently eschew this kind of thinking and just use the same lot size for all my positions.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hay Jay, I think I will subscribe to Candlesticker You seem to be very enthusiastic. I understand besides showing various charts patterns they also advise when to trade. Am I right? I checked their site and I believe for what they charge it is a worth a try. Thanks for it. Of course You definitely are not employed by them.....

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Nope, I'm just sharing what's been working for me. I'll probably get some needed improvements to my system from all the public scrutiny. Which I will ultimately use to develop my expert advisor. And then... unending vacation. Or, this whole dream could just fall apart.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I understand nobody can predict the future but if someone follows candlestick patterns it is a good site for getting them straight all at once in front of You instead of losing a lot of time checking them one by one Yourself. Then of course is up to the trader to interpret them. Thank You for Your answer and have a nice Week-End

--- 帖子 #82 ---
If you could post a screenshot of the pattern performance this would be great!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Yikes what happened today?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Here ya go for the overall view

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I admit I am taking a bloodbath today. Kind of like looking at a train wreck. This is why I changed the way the strategy works on June 6th, but according to my internal rules, the trades placed before my change follow the old method which loads risk at the end instead of the beginning and can produce whipsaws. If I survive these retracements the system should be stronger on the other side. One of the metrics I have for my trading performance personally is did I follow my plan. So, I try to stick with my plan if I can, hopefully, it will not lead to a full wipeout, but if it does, that is the risk that I have accepted. It would be fairly ridiculous but possible that I could wipe out my account three days after I decided to start a thread and share it with the world, my hubris would definitely be checked.

RealTrade was my first broker. If you trade with EA, broker will cancel your profitable trades. This happened to me. They have strange rules: you can use an EA, but they can cancel any trades opened by EA for no reason. I do not recommend them, stay safe. IenDzi.

Each pattern gets a page, I'm not sure if you can see them without a subscription. Looking at this again, it is all lumped together.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Thanks for the heads up, it seems that there are quite a bit of negative comments toward them. Personally, they have not treated me in any untoward way and I have used EA's and gotten withdrawals. I'm not recommending them but they have been fine by me so far. However, a few months ago their link to the android MetaTrader 4 app failed so now I have to use a different method to check my trades on my phone. But, I have been an unprofitable trader for most of my time with them...

Ok, think I have figured out what you need. Here is the pattern performance for EURAUD Attached Image (click to enlarge) You could probably just use the ones that result in a 1% gain or more. There is a different sheet for each currency pair that they track. and here is EURUSD since that is so popular. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am thinking I could have a more nuanced view and only take the trades based off of patterns that have shown good performance for that pair.

Looks like we are working towards an answer for improvement #2. I definitely believe that only taking the trades based off of patterns that have shown good performance for that pair would be a great improvement towards obtaining better entry points. This stuff I shall incorporate into my system shortly. I want to thank the community for all their great suggestions, yeah I'll use dynamic spacing also.

I'm putting some serious thought into using take profit levels, like say at 1 ATR(14) of profit close 1/2 your lots and then close another 1/4 at 2 ATR(14) leaving the last quarter to play out with the original rules of confirmed opposite candlestick pattern or stop-loss. I'm tired of seeing money gained and then lost. We could have locked in some of the phantom profits.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi Jay, so i have been thinking about it, i think this system is best, when you do not add more orders as it goes, just keep the initial entry, or at most add just one more order after the first 100 pips...and let it ride,just my thought....

--- 帖子 #96 ---
A good start...could you do this for all symbols and save the html files and pack all in ONE zip file? Then I could import in Xl and analyse them all... And what means confirmed? Only 66% confirmed but 100% successfull?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Confirmed looks to be the confirmed patterns as a % of the total patterns so 2/3*100=66% Then there's profitable patterns as a % of the confirmed. How does it get the profit/loss % in the table though? Hi Reteid2222. Your the best coder here I think

--- 帖子 #98 ---
After the way it crashed and burned on Friday, I would agree. I am thinking just take the initial order and set a take profit for double the distance of the stop loss and get out with your profits, also there is no need to take every signal just take the formations that worked in the past. That would make it similar to a 2R system.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Ok will do once I get back to my computer, Confirmed - means that the candlestick pattern was created then another candle closed beyond the signal line. For instance if say we see a bullish engulfing candle the signal line is near the top of the formation not counting the wicks. This formation would not be confirmed until such time as a bullish candle has closed above the signal line. So, after a candle pattern forms it could theoretically take days to get a confirmation or sometimes it may never confirm. If we don't get a bullish candle close above the signal line before the detection of a new pattern to track we would never get the confirmation. This is the meaning of the confirmation statistic. Bearish patterns need a bearish candle to close below the signal line and bullish patterns need a close above it. This can be more fully explained by reviewing candlesticker.com In general, the theory is that we wait for confirmation to reduce false signals, since with confirmation it has proven itself a little bit, kinda like a down payment. Successful - Once we have a confirmed candlestick formation and placed an order was it profitable? Using the close only on the confirmation of an opposite type of candlestick method.

Try opening confirmed trades on sunday and monday and close them tuesday night. The market tends to reverse after tuesday.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
They need to expand the percentages 0, 1, 2, 3 are not very informative, I think it is the actual percentage of profit you would have made on your account if you had taken the trade. Using the following assumptions, you were trading 1 lot order size and had an account that was worth 10,000. Or it could be the hold over from some stock thing that I have yet to figure out. In any event the higher the percentage here the better I think.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
If this is true then that is genius! How did you figure this out, merely by emperical observation? You could use that information as an edge and build a complete system around it.

Lol, i got it from contrarian thread. Beats watching your earnings dissapear in 1 day, doesnt it?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Ive added an ADR and it give 92 (14 setting) here. Didn't make it to +92 either but close to it. Also seems that we opened very high above the signal/buy level at 1.53779. Maybe only take a trade when it closes at a certain level above the buy line?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Interesting thoughts, I would guess that it will hit the +92 sometime next week. Once we get a confirmed pattern maybe waiting for a minor retace is the thing, I think a buy limit order at the buy line or close to it could obtain better entries. On a second look this would not have worked with the current trade.

Hi JayDavis thank you so much for sharing. Just had a look at candlesticker.com some of the things they said are difficult to comprehend. What the heck are they trying to say in the last para???

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi Jay, Pretty wild swings with this method. Maybe you should stick to the pairs that work well like EUR/CAD which you caught some nice swings. I wonder if adding a 100 pip trailing stop might help. That way when the second position gets opened the first will go to B/E. Just a thought. Don

--- 帖子 #113 ---
100 pip trailing stoploss, I like it. After Friday I am loving the idea of locking in profits.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Jay’s Candle Sticker System Version 2 You never really know what you got until you try to explain it to someone else. Having my account drop from pinging 20K last month to 2,600 last Friday has brought about some disquieting reflection. Something about my strategy need to change. I need to figure out a way to lock in some of these massive profits that I glanced at for a fleeting moment. New improvements: Reduce the overall lots at risk. Using a total of one lot size for the total position. Close half of the order at 1 ATR(14) profit or 100 pips. Close a quarter at 2 ATR(14) or 200 pips. Leave open the last quarter to be closed by an opposite confirmation candle or a stop-loss, to catch those long streaks. Add a 100 pip trailing stop-loss to each order to address major reversals. Trade selection will be improved by being more selective and only taking trades using confirmed candle patterns that have shown a net gain of at least 1 percent when traded in the past. I don’t need to take every trade that is put in front of me, just the ones with the highest chance of being a winner. Girlfriend rule, if you account doubles in a day close all positions. Procedure: When signaled with a confirmed candlestick pattern. Create a 0.5 lot-sized order at the market price with 100 pip trailing stop-loss and take-profit at 1 ATR(14) or 100 pips. Create a 0.25 lot-sized order at market price with 100 pip trailing stop-loss and take-profit at 2 ATR(14) or 200 pips. Create a 0.25 lot-sized order at market price with 100 pip trailing stop-loss and no take profit, wait for reversal candlestick pattern or stop-loss. --- Still under development so improvements and suggestions are most welcome. Also to alleviate spread risk the time to enter trades moves to 6:30 - 7:00 pm Eastern, spreads should have returned to normal by that time.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sure, bear in mind that you do not place the stop-loss on the chart. This sentence explains the mechanics about when to close the trade if it goes beyond the stop-loss. Also, keep in mind that you are only making decisions once a day for 15 minutes a day. So let us examine the sentence in detail. The stop loss level is defined as the last low. -The lowest point reached in the formation of the bullish hammer. Following the BUY, - You have a valid buy trade working. if prices go down instead of going up, and close or make two consecutive daily lows below the stop loss level, while no bearish pattern is detected, then the stop loss is triggered. - Basically, your trade is not going well and if it closes below the stop-loss level or dips under it twice, which would take multiple days (bear in mind that it (the stop-loss) is NOT on the chart so it will not auto trigger) you close the trade during your daily 15-minute analysis. If there was a bearish pattern your trigger to close the order could happen before the stop-loss due to a valid opposite confirmed candlestick pattern.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
you do not have to get out, you can trail your stop loss to the low or high of the last candle, everyday, the reason is so when you have a runner, those types where you have 10 up or down days straight, u do be in . the market will take you out by it self...take the first entry, trail the stop, market takes you out by itself...

--- 帖子 #117 ---
How about you trail stop loss the following way: This is for a buy signal; Intial stop loss 2 x daily ATR. Every time there is a bullish candle with a higher open than the last bullish candle, you move your sl , calculate 2 x ATR from the open of the new bullish candle down. When you reach 4 x ATR in profit reduce your sl to 1 x ATR and keep trailing with 1 x ATR.

Hey Jay Came across your thread and I find this quite interesting so far. Thanks for posting this. I quickly read most of the posts on this thread. I have also subscribed. I have to say your girlfriend is very smart! I would like to add this which I am pretty sure it will be very helpful to you and many others. About the statement "If the account doubles in a day close all positions" This sounds very good in theory but with a lot of experience of trying many many things myself, for me this statement only bothers me. So IMHO if you think or believe or witnessed your account doubling in a day, to me you should see this as a danger. This only means your account can also wipe out in a day. Unless you can logically explain why to yourself why that is not a possibility? So I would like to suggest the most important thing you want to consider here is your Lotsize. You want to go a lot lot smaller if you believe there is a possibility of doubling the account.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Do those vertical lines represent tuesdays?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
if you read the contrarian thread, you open trades at sundays going against the crowd(the retail traders) if certain conditions were to met. And usually the profits peak around tuesday nights. than profit taking begins. this was just a suggestions from the guy who started the system, in order to protect profits, not much different than your plan of keeping winning trades. time remains to see if there is an edge or not. last week there were no valid trades so i cant say anything at the moment. but i will let you know end of the week how it goes.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I appreciate the comment, I do, with the new strategies I really don't think that the account would double in a day anymore, unless extremely lucky. However, it sounds like your risk profile is a lot more conservative than mine which is fine. I have seen it happen multiple times the doubling and the wiping in the past, risk big, win or lose big. Thanks for subscribing, what lot size would you suggest? The prototypical 2%?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I really found this thread very interesting and seems like it can provide some edge. But I still have to do some detail study of what you have mentioned and also what Americanbulls.com services that they are offering. I am wondering how reliable is their data history they are providing for each pair and its performance based on their signals. Its quite interesting though. My risk management always depend on detail study of a system. I try to figure out what will be my max drawdown based on studying all possible scenarios. I then also try to calculate the annual ROI. To me if the annual ROI : DD ratio should always be more than 5:1. Anything less than that does not interest me in the Forex market. Once I have figured out my annual ROI : DD ratio, I would decide my lotsize based on my risk tolerance and confidence level for that system. All the above said, my personal preference and my math for choosing lotsize would be targeting ROI of 100% per year with accepted DD of 20% max. If I am seeing 100% (doubling account) in 1 day...I would think my Lotsize is way too large since I am not willing to handle the risk that it would come with.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I am sorry I didn't provide a direct answer to your simple question since I don't have a simple answer since the way you are trading this involved multiple trades being opened simultaneously. This means you may have 1 trade open at a certain point and you may also have 28 trades open at a certain point (if you are trading the 28 standards) If I were trading this I will just figure out what the max DD possible if I had trades open on all 28 pairs and I would set the Lotsize so that the max drawdown would never ever be more than 20% of my account size. I hope this help.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I just wondered about the following: 1) Do you trade every confirmed signal? 2) Is there ever a situation where you could have 2 opposite signals based on different patterns for the same pair?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thanks for your insight, I understand how you would approach things. Could be some valuable tools when creating a low-risk low return stable profitable system, after having, of course, used a high-risk system to get the capital needed for the low risk system to provide any decent gains.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
1. In the past I have traded every confirmed candlestick pattern that I was aware of provided by American bulls, they don't have all 28 pairs, a recent thought has led me to want to only trade signals that have shown profitable in the past. Which is how I will proceed in the future. 2. Nope, an opposite signal is the signal needed to close your current trade, you could just close it, or close it an open a new trade depending upon the strength of the signal. ps. I did start in January using 2% of equity as my lot size, as my profits and confidence grew I increased my lot size. Sometimes I would fail to make trades because I was busy doing other things, but for the last two months, I have been pretty consistent.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I understood your answer, basically at no point would you ever want to have more than 20% of your account at risk at any one time.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Thanks for your quick replies. I appreciate it.

Sure no problem, I appreciate the helpful insights. I sorta feel like if you can't explain what you are doing in a logical and precise way, then you might want to examine why you are doing it.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thanks for posting this. Any idea how do they generate the following signal performance? I mean is it based on taking every single signal that generated for that pair? Do you believe their reporting is reliable? IMO most signal services cook these reports to show positive ROI.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
$420/year. Is it worth it

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Considering your risk profile I am sure those are questions that you would have. A few posts back I gave my thoughts on how they generated performance particularly the % profit. Yes, it is based on taking every signal and closing the trade by stop loss or opposite confirmed candlestick pattern. I guess I'm more trusting in that regard. I don't see any reason why they would need to cook the books. I don't consider them a signal service, more of a candlestick pattern detector. How you trade with the info is up to you. And yea what Emerald2112 said, if you really want to get into the weeds get a short subscription and analyze your heart out.

I noticed they have $50 for 1 month option. I might try them out.

Wow! Thank u for your effort explaining! It is clear now when u said no actual stop loss order being placed. I understand u trade solely on candlestick patterns so can I say that u don't have an insight of why a trade went against u? Could it be due to some high impact ecomics news release? I would suggest that u pull up the e.calendar during ur 5pm et analysis and close up those positions which have high impact news releasing on that day and also avoid placing trades for those affected pairs

New orders from Sunday Evening. So the account doubled from its lowest point on Friday so the girlfriend rule was initiated. I closed all positions. That being done, I looked to see what new candlestick patterns were confirmed. I took two trades. A sell-on GBPJPY and a sell on EURJPY. GBPJPY formed a BEARISH DARK CLOUD COVER pattern which finally received a confirmation because the prices crossed below the confirmation level which was at 147.2000 Stop Loss: 148.1200 Sell Level: 147.2000 Entry Point: 146.786 EURJPY formed a BEARISH HARAMI pattern which received a confirmation because the prices crossed below the confirmation level which was at 129.1650 Stop Loss: 130.2700 Sell Level:129.1650 Using the new rules for version 2, I opened 0.5 lot with take-profit at 1 ATR(14) Also opened 0.25 with take-profit at 2 ATR(14) and another 0.25 with no take profit. All orders have 100 pip trailing stop losses attached, or so I hope I did not see any change in my MetaTrader when I right click enabled my trailing stops. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hibra, The answer is no; this vertical line represent date when market made turn, they show that JD trading perspective has nothing to do with intraweek cycles of day traders activity. I think Jay Davies trading perspective is different. System is targeting longer moves, lasting more than a week.

yes , but he is rethinking that already, thats why i suggested taking profit early before cycles turn around.

well i can see if im in profit or not on tuesday, if im in profit ill close, if im not than ill tighten my stops. if it dont work its ok cause im using demo for contrarian system. so if my earnings go from 2000% to 500% i wont be slashing my rists. lol but ill keep u posted. p.s. for the patterns maybe go for 1:2 rr as an alternative.

Thanks for this comprehensive analysis. So, taken as a whole removing outliers you get a 50% chance of having a profit or not. Do you think there is value in analyzing the pairs separately, could it produce an edge in trading just that pair?

No need for an alert, you can get updated signals after 5 pm here https://www.americanbulls.com/SignalListFX.aspx?lang=en I would also suggest reading "The Consistent Trader" for some perspective.

I appreciate the discussion, this rule of thumb opening trades on Sunday, Monday, and closing on Tuesday seems simple, but sometimes the best rules are.

I uploaded the Xl file if U want to do sum more analysis...by the way I m a great fan of these candlestick pattern...

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Excellent glad you like. I could probably figure it out with some additional study but one quick question. When you consider total patterns are you including confirmed patterns with unconfirmed patterns? Attached File(s) Pattern Analysis by Pair.pdf 92 KB | 303 downloads

--- 帖子 #152 ---
also its good to see which specific pattern is best for a specific pair.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I have another question. When its says successfull patterns what does it mean? Does it mean that the sl was not hit and the trade was closed with profit when we get an opposite signal? And what about unsuccessfull? Does it mean that the sl was hit right away without going so much further? One mans fail is another mans success. First lets see which specific pattern is best for which specific currency pair than---- We have to see how far each specific pattern goes into + territory before hitting sl.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Successful pattern means that if one took the trade when it was confirmed and then waited for an opposite pattern to confirm before exiting the trade it would have garnered a profit. Unsuccessful means that one would have lost money either on the stop-loss or an opposite formation confirming whilst the trade was in the negative. Checking the zip files from earlier, you already have the data concerning which formations are best for which pairs, it is just not beautifully organized in a spreadsheet. reteid2222 may have this info in the spreadsheet, I have yet to examine it thoroughly. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post11150774 post #110

--- 帖子 #155 ---
cool, i hope there is a way to find out how far the most successfull pairs go into profit before turning around and hitting sl.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
In my opinion, it makes no sense to focus on the most efficient pair. Each pair has better and worse periods. Good profits and stable growth must go hand in hand with possibly low DD. Such parameters can be achieved without reducing the number of pairs or focusing on selected pairs but on the contrary, diversifying the portfolio as much as possible with different instruments and markets ... I have been doing five-year tests for different simple trend follow-up systems and always diversification was the key to a moderate, not ragged growth curve. I was surprised to see pairs having one year more than 30% in green and in other years to note a few percent in the red .... I also realize that test results do not necessarily reflect the future.

While coding and searching...I don t see many signals like morning star...for me not worth the time....i would focus on "normal" morning stars like bearish candle, doji...and bullish.... As i looked on the chart...why not take dojis and buy sell stops on high and low? Does anyone trade this?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
How do you determine the trend? That's what you are asking correct? In my coding for this system, I have been looking at the candle before the formation to figure out the trend. I take that candle and then look one candle back to see if the first candle has a higher high and a higher low than the previous candle for an uptrend while for downtrends, I check it the initial candle has lower highs and lower lows than its previous candle. It is difficult to determine the trend and I would like to see your thoughts on the matter.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
It would be nice to catch the tops and bottoms of moves, but this system waits for confirmation. Which supposedly gives us more assurance that the move is correct.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
JayDavis, reteid2222, What are we trying to do here? Seems like we might be diverging from the original idea of this thread. The original idea was there is already a service which provides you signals for like 84 patterns for 20 of the pairs. You can take those trades every day after the Daily candle has closed. Unless you want to do deep analysis of past performance you get this service for practically free. The process of taking or not taking any trades that they suggest each day should not take more than 15 min each day. It seems like you are generating a EA to automate certain things.....but to my understanding its a HUGE effort to include all the patterns and IMO just picking certain patterns and not the others based on historic performance of them is not a good idea. I do see some value if all 84 patterns could be coded but I wonder if it is worth all the effort since you are already getting that for free.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
guys the candle stick formations work better with commodities and stocks. some stocks made over 50% within a few days. i dont think its worth it to trade with forex. maximum gain is tops 2% within the same time period. this is normal as candle sticks became popular due to their success in trading rice and such in 1700's in japan. ps. you can tell the americanbulls website puts more emphasis on stocks.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Everyone if interested, should try the system, only own experience can tell you the truth. Does it suit you, is it profitable for you or not? Problem is it takes time and needs some effort, without which the answer remains unknown. Look, thread is a week old, trade lasts in average few weeks. How much time have you spent testing to get your answer? One week??? I am sure, this what brought you guys to this thread was great results Jay scored so far. But remember, he worked with fantastic commitment, passion and consistency for last six months. Two months of trendy market helps him very much, but this is all about being at right place at right time. SO, gentlemen, do your own test, research, stop diverging from original idea, grab your own experience and then develop your own changes. Are you guys ready to sacrifice few months of work for it?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Is there a way to see how the stocks have performed? Lets see if they have more than 50% Like you said its a coin flip at or below 50% I dont see the point in spending so much time on it.

I don t know what U r doing...I just want to get the best performance in %! Yes but i prooved it for myself that it is not significant more than throwing a coin 4 entry=50% I think it is a paid service.... U r right...100% automating....hearing my lessons in university while my EA is working like slaves building the pyramids in former times... Nevertheless thanks to everyone who gave me information here.... I think what best works are the reversals on S/R lines....and I will code this... One pattern this one: Inserted Code //************************************************************************* // bullHammer //************************************************************************* bool bullHammer(int i, double &amp;buyVal, double &amp;slVal){ bool isSignal; buyVal=Close[i]+distFrombuy*Point; slVal=Low[i]-distFromSL*Point; return candle.green(i) // Candle is green &amp;&amp; Open[i]-Low[i]&gt;2*(Close[i]-Open[i]) // Shadow has to be min 2 times of the size of body &amp;&amp; 4*(High[i]-Close[i])&lt; candle.fullLength(i) // Wick has to be short ; return true; } Look on my indi...you see that certain pattern works...i have to look which are working... So I will of course leave this thread...cause I don t see the good percentage rate of the signals....but wish U best luck with the 15 minutes...

Hello I am blown away by you and your work. I think you are one of the best people on this site. If you need any testers for any of your EA or indicators you can count me in. I also agree that reversal are the best because you can usually use the last high/low as a SL and let them run for big TP really increases your profits. I also like to add at least one trade to a trade at the first pull back after I take a reversal trade. Ladies all the way to the top lol. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Have you tried applying the patterns to lower time frames? I think that you are using too high of a leverage for the daily chart, but high leverage is perfectly achievable in smaller time frames where your stop losses will be tighter. Just a thought. I trade only M5 at 400:1, but it would be pretty scary using that kind of leverage just from daily chart patterns. Best wishes,

Try the indicator with the two pattern on M5...if you need ONE or TWO new...tell me!

I just bought the consistent trader by Sam and I am reading through. Are there tips on how to maximise the reading so that i get the best out of the book

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Congrats on getting the book. It helped me to develop a trading plan that fit my personality. When reading take what you like, notice the rest but bear in mind there is no one best way. I used to view trading as a battle between me and the markets, now I'm more of the mind that is is an internal struggle. Get the inside stuff right and you will be well on your way to profitability.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Why I am throwing out the girlfriend rule. It destroy's momentum. I have used this rule in the past, the one where if your account doubles within a 24 hour period close all positions. It stifles profits. If you are winning why would you sell? This is a classic amateur move closing positions too early. It is a cute sounding rule and even seems like a logical way to keep some of your profits, but the exit point is essentially arbitrary. I think it harms more than it helps.

That EURAUD buy on signal confirmation got to TP. Just in time as Whoo my EU short came good. EJ too. But good that the signal for EURAUD was good despite the Euro fall due to news. Shame this is demo and only small lots or id be doing this for a living lol. Anyway last trade charts from me unless via the system rules here.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I'm just coming across this post and I'm really liking what I'm seeing. Ok, let me get this right so I don't screw it up.... At the end of the day, we are using American Bull to see if there was a "BUY" or "SELL" daily candle that formed. Then, if you want, look at the candle pattern's past performance history (for that pair) and judge weather or not we want to jump in? ... If of course you have a membership to look at the performance percentages and history. Without a membership, are these candle patterns still up to date? I noticed all these BUY and SELL signals were mainly for the 11th and 12th. Were they originally posted on those days? Stop losses and everything else aside, is this the initial set up and entry? I'm thinking about testing out a month membership and doing what you're doing, and only taking trades on the candles with a higher winning probability. What other benefits come with a membership besides performance history? Thanks again Jay.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
You have essentially gotten the gist of it. There is some weirdness because it is set for stocks, but if you check this thread you will figure it out. All the current signals are valid as far as 5 pm on the most recent trading day. I suggest creating a spreadsheet and keeping track of the new ones each day. Members also get buy and sell levels a more detailed history of past confirmations. Early detection of potential confirmations. If you downloaded the zip files that is a snapshot of what a member sees.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Yeah, GBP/USD just updated today, and with a SELL. Thanks for the advice. I went ahead and started a spreadsheet. I'm making it a little easier because I'm only looking at EUR/USD and GBP/USD. I try and only look at those two then trying to watch 28 different pairs. Its helped my trading because after looking at the same two pair for months, you really get to know the patterns and movement. You can almost predict what it will do certain times of the day on certain days. But anywho... candle patterns is a big weakness for me. This will be a great tool to learn and a way for me to learn these two pairs even better. This is kinda like asking for someone else's homework but would you or anyone happen to have a spread sheet of what the pairs have done on previous days? I'm getting to this party late Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Attached Image So, after much study, we figured out that BUY means a buy order was placed and SELL means an order was closed. While Short means that a sell order was placed. If a Short follows a buy then the buy was closed and a sell order was opened. If a buy follows a short then the sell order was closed and a new buy order was opened. In general, sell means close, as in sell-off. Remember stock-terms. So... 12/29/2017 Starting with $10,000 a buy order was placed suffering $10 in transaction fees. 01/08/2018 Buy order was closed with a profit of $590, No new order was opened no trades are happening you just have your cash 01/12/2018 A buy order was created for $10 in transaction fees. 02/05/2018 Your buy order was closed with $3,912 in profits. No orders are open now you are in cash. etc..... Essentially when you just see a decrement of $10, that is a sign that the position moved from a cash position.

Well, I got this massive spreadsheet that may or may not be useful for you, I can't guarantee that the data is correct and I moved on to a new system three days ago. Attached File(s) AmericanBullsTracking.xlsx 4.2 MB | 403 downloads

Jay’s Candle Sticker System Version 3 New improvements: Reduce the overall lots at risk. Using a total of one lot size for the total position. Close half of the order at 1 ATR(14) profit or 100 pips. Close a quarter at 2 ATR(14) or 200 pips. Leave open the last quarter to be closed by an opposite confirmation candle or a stop-loss, to catch those long streaks. Add a 100 pip trailing stop-loss to each order to address major reversals. Trade selection will be improved by being more selective and only taking trades using confirmed candle patterns that have shown a net gain of at least 1 percent when traded in the past. I don’t need to take every trade that is put in front of me, just the ones with the highest chance of being a winner. Girlfriend rule, if you account doubles in a day close all positions. Procedure: When signaled with a confirmed candlestick pattern. Create a 0.5 lot-sized order at the market price with 100 pip trailing stop-loss and take-profit at 1 ATR(14) or 100 pips. Create a 0.25 lot-sized order at market price with 100 pip trailing stop-loss and take-profit at 2 ATR(14) or 200 pips. Create a 0.25 lot-sized order at market price with 100 pip trailing stop-loss and no take profit, wait for reversal candlestick pattern or stop-loss. --- Still under development so improvements and suggestions are most welcome. Also to alleviate spread risk the time to enter trades moves to 6:30 - 7:00 pm Eastern, spreads should have returned to normal by that time. Take trades shortly after 7 pm eastern. Additional notes: Update a spreadsheet every day with the signals from AB Buy all BUY signals, Close all SELL signals(unless in cash), Sell all SHORT signals.

How about to move SL to BE for last position when TP2 is hit?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I keep forgetting the page is not really for Forex. Sooo... we are looking for "BUY" and "SHORT" to get into trades? And a "SELL" is actually telling us to get out of a trade? Not in it? Well that's good to know. My sell orders would of been train wrecks. You had mentioned that AmericanBull is not really for Forex and that it looked like it was added as an "after thought" and is the "StepChiled". I have been thinking about dabbling into other areas of trading. I'm thinking about opening up a small RobinHood account on my phone and using the page to mess around with small Penny Stocks (Stocks under $5.00 with high volume.) Just an idea.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Sounds like a good idea, I'll keep that in mind for the next version.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Good luck with that, I am too in love with leverage to give it a true go. I got like $300 in a https://www.stockpile.com account, which I don't even look at every day. However, they do not give me access to the penny stocks so I guess that's why it is not exciting. I doubt RobinHood lets you trade penny stocks. Did I say "StepChiled" I meant to say Red-Headed Step-Child!

A small effort at automating the system on the EURUSD pair. This EA is simplified from the main strategy in a few ways. 1. Stop-losses are actually set and applied. 2. Take profits are a multiple of stop-loss. 3. Lot size is determined by a percentage of equity. I took the twelve signals for EURUSD and coded them up to use as trade initiators. This EA takes trades after a candlestick pattern has been confirmed with a close beyond a buy or sell level. Stop-losses are the ones given by the candlestick pattern and there is an adjustable input as a multiple of stop-loss distances to allow you to set your take profits. Lotsize is determined by a percentage of equity which you can also set. It is alpha at this stage. I don't think we can really mimic the system until all 84 patterns are coded up. Ultimately you would not get the best exits without having all the patterns. In lieu of having all 84 candlestick pattern coded I have used the take profits system.

Hi Jay, The system looks good thus far to me and very promising. I'm definitely giving it an honest shot however, with 0.02/0.01/0.01 lots.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
For all those following the candlesticker system it suggests placing a buy on USDCAD since a bullish pattern confirmed on close of trading Friday. I plan to execute a buy at market sometime around 7 pm on Sunday July 17th.

Hello sir, I have just joined the forum and not very familiar with this, I have opened account thru fxtm under investments strategy manager, just 4 days prior and lost 408 dollars on second day. I do not know TA at all. I want to change the broker, please advise me and if full automatically algo trading available with decent return. I am novice

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hello Jay, thanks a lot for this topic. I am trying to follow the signals, but have a feeling that they are appearing too late (at least free signals, may be it is better with subscription). And this can be a tricky thing - if you analyze history of signals, it seems that signals are mostly profitable...but look at this USDCAD signal - you can enter only on Sunday, as I suppose with price about 31.800 and this is far worse than it is stated on their website (about 31.000). But they use their entry price 31.000 for historical data to make the whole picture look better. And if you are subscribed, it means that even you got that signal too late...

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi, This thread supports a manual trading strategy that is not automated, yet. At the moment trading, the candle sticker system would require 15 min per day of analysis. Welcome to the forum. I've got nothing to say about brokers, I don't have any personal experience with fxtm. Sorry to hear about your losses, looks like you are paying your tuition towards becoming a successful trader. I know personally, I suffered losses for ten years before I found a system that I was able to use and profit from, so your journey may be long if it is similar to mine. You could figure out the candlesticker system by reviewing the thread to see if it is something you want to do.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Love this thread Jay; love your system. I find your approach to stop-losses quite unique; never seen this approach to risk-management before but it strikes me the number of times I have been stopped-out, by intra-day spikes, only to see the pair continuing in the direction of my intended trade right after. I'm in!. Regards.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
You dont have to pay. Except if you are monitoring stocks, because there are too many of them. If you goto candle sticker.com they have all the patterns. All you have to do is check everyday at 5pm, thats it. Hint, best patterns are bullish, bearish harami and engulfing.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thank you for sharing MQL code Jay. I am an advocate of sharing code samples for readers to read, investigate, understand and become self-sufficient on their own abilities. Believe me guys, MQL is not hard to learn at all. Anyone can do it with the zero experience. You also get my Hats-off for putting a TE and being a role model for others to follow. You escaped my Ignore list :-) You are my hero bro! Keep it up! You are helping others get out of swamp. I had coded all kinds of patterns a long time ago. I would have no problem give it to you here with an understanding that I offer no assurance they are accurately coded. Code is all cut and paste from open source and I used such patterns only in my research and not for trading. Let me know. Edit: I am not a developer by profession so you or someone would have to volunteer to keep future developments as open source

Looking at their signal it looks like they obtained the price of 1.3114. https://www.americanbulls.com/Signal...&amp;Ticker=USDCAD It is true that since I am waiting usually a couple of hours before I take the signal there is a chance that I will obtain a worse or better price, I assume it will even itself out over time. I assure you the free signals are the same as the paid. Having a paid membership gives you access to more historical data, buy and sell levels, early warnings of possible confirmations and a few other things. I posted zip files which shows a snapshot of what the paid members get a while ago. I really don't care if you get their membership as it does not benefit me other, then the insights you may gain and share.

Upon further inspection, it does appear that this is an impossible price since the close on Friday was higher than this price.

All good Jay, thanks. I seem to have completely ignored that we must await confirmation of the patterns, which may take any number of days. All looking good. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Just waiting for the candlestick pattern to form is not enough, we must have valid confirmation! A pattern may take days to confirm, it may never confirm if say another pattern appears before it confirms. If a new pattern appears while we are waiting for confirmation, then we switch to the new pattern and wait for it to confirm before placing a trade.

Hi On EURGBP the recommendation table says buy at 0.8738 where is this figure coming from? Close of the confirmation candle is 0.8773

--- 帖子 #224 ---
The 0.8738 level is the close of daily candle of the 15th june, basically the doji candle which completes the pattern and the pattern got confirmed on the 18th of june and its close became our recommended Buy at 0.8773 level. Jay am I correct or perhaps might have decoded this incorrectly?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi JD, Nice thread. Do you have any statistics of patterns that you use? I mean e.g. if you trade engulfing pattern - how often it is a winning pattern?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
This is also my understanding.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
We have traveled down this path before if you are truly interested comb through the thread, you will find what you seek. I feel like Yoda, but I don't feel like looking through the thread to get you the answer to this question since it has been a dead end. A prior member had the same question and created a spreadsheet of all the patterns and all the pairs based on the zip files which hold a snapshot of what subscribers see at AB. Ultimately, I think she deemed it 50-50.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
First off thanks Jay for sharing. I spent the entire day reading each and every comment before commenting. If you can allow me to vent first. I see many like in all other posts see nice profits and want to take a short cut. You will continue to jump from system and continuously give your money to the market. Some did mention this as well as the fact that this is a very young post. So give it time. Then, before throwing comments and shade, make sure you understand what Jay has developed and then see for urself and respond with proof instead of theory as that doesn't help much. The fact that Jay is so patient is probably a good thing for some. Jay also mentioned that the book taught him one key thing we should all learn from. and that is not just for this strategy/system but for all your forex life if ever you going to be successful. It is simply this... use and develop your OWN system. Trust me on this. You can take a little bit from everywhere and make it work. If you blindly follow someone's system you will fail no doubt. The fact that you go against the most common advise that is all over forex posts around % of balance etc, is probably what gives you the edge as well. The one caution only be for you to refine you risk management. Now that I fully understand your system as well as the various changes you spoke off, I have subscribed and will see how to trade and revert with feedback. My theory of forex wont add value to your system as I need to use yours in real trade and not past data. Jay well done so far and please stop answering things that was covered in past posts. If people are really interested, they can go read. If you dont want to read, then this is not for you. Move on.

https://www.americanbulls.com/Signal...&amp;Ticker=GBPCHF GBPCHF - Our system’s recommendation today is to SHORT . The BEARISH ENGULFING pattern finally received a confirmation because the prices crossed below the confirmation level which was at 1.3157 GBPCHF

--- 帖子 #230 ---
subscribed the thread. i like these candle pattern trading, similar to another thread in the forum. Just struggling with the exit and money management

Here is a pic from https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/patterns y ou can see all the patterns by timeframe if you want.

UPDATE: All trades have been taken since the start of this week using Jay's system. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trade well.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi, how do you know where you are placing your stops for this again? Are you getting them off of americanbulls as well?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Each candlestick pattern has a natural stop-loss. The stop loss for this Bearish Engulfing GBPCHF pattern is 1.3245 I am sure you are aware that we do not actually place the stop-loss on the chart in a way in which it could auto trigger. For BEARISH ENGULFING The stop loss level is defined as the last high. Following the bearish signal, if prices go up instead of going down, and close or make two consecutive daily highs above the stop loss level, while no bullish pattern is detected, then the stop loss is triggered. https://www.candlesticker.com/Patter...n&amp;Pattern=2201 Stop losses are given to you when you have a subscription to AB (review zip files). You could also manually determine it by reviewing the candlestick pattern. If you don't have a subscription simply wait for a SELL signal to trigger. If a stop-loss is triggered the SELL signal will present and you would be instructed to close the trade. So the simple BUY on BUY, Close on SELL, and Sell on SHORT works to keep you trading the system even if you are unaware of the stop losses.

I'm not sure about the other two but on the GBPUSD, I would buy carefully because on my end it looks like it will retrace at least 40 pips before either going up or down.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi JayDavis, thank you for this thread and for your system of trading. Do you trade also exotic pairs as INRUSD, NOKUSD, PENUSD, etc...? There is a BUY signal today (22th June) on these pairs on americanbulls.com website.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
No, I don't trade the exotic pairs. I think they may work, I just don't have access to them with my broker. Come to think of it I stick to the majors because that is what I have pretty much always done, which now that I think about it is not a good reason. I did try BitCoin for a little bit, but it was too weird to continue. I did not seem to have full access to the instrument. I had a few attempts early in my trading journey at trading some exotics. I remember the spreads were horrible. If you do consider and trade the exotic pairs let us know how they work out. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Have a good weekend. For those trading my candlesticker system your weekend has started. If we receive any trades after the market closes today, we would not be able to act upon them till Sunday evening so your weekend started just after placing your trades yesterday. -Regards

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Enjoy too jay. Sunday it is then.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Used time go your lastmanstanding indicator that really helped me with the understanding of markets moves. Just subscribed to your thread and I hope will learn something more. Good luck and let's make some pips!

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi Jay, Thank you for introducing a system that does not use a "hard stop loss". It enables one to avoid "stop loss hunting". It has opened up a whole new way of trading. My only query is "how do you set your take profit targets?" Have a great weekend

--- 帖子 #243 ---
According to my most recent update version #3. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post11169897 I currently use 1 ATR(14) as my first take profit, 2 * ATR(14) as my second and I leave one trade open to being closed by opposite candlestick pattern confirmation or stop-loss. Explaining further if I have a buy trade I would take the value of Average True Range (ATR) for 14 periods and add it to my opening price to obtain my first take-profit. Next, I double the value of the ATR obtained earlier and add it to my opening price to get my second take-profit. Finally, I don't set a take-profit on my last order leaving it open to be closed by a confirmed bearish candlestick pattern or stop-loss. In the case of a short trade, I would subtract the ATR values from my opening price to obtain the take-profit values. The final position would be left open to be closed by a confirmed bullish candlestick pattern or stop-loss. The first iteration of my system only used confirmed candlestick patterns for take-profits, however now I've decided to lock in some profits as the markets move.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Sir Can you clarify how to calculate ATR (14) profit? I am confused.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I simply take the ATR(14) value and add or subtract it to my opening price and use it as a take profit. For example. For the buy on GBPCHF yesterday the ATR(14) was 0.0082 and my opening price was 1.31255 so my first take profit was 1.32075 (1.31255+0.0082) and my second take profit was 1.32895 (1.31255+0.0082+0.0082) while the last order was left without a take profit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_true_range It is an indicator in your MT4 installation. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Once you attach the ATR(14) indicator to your chart, you should see the value. Attached Image (click to enlarge) For those with the quick eye, yes this ATR value is different from the spreadsheet, and that is simply because this screenshot is from a different day, the next day in this case.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thanks sir. Now I am very clear. Nice strategy. God bless you.

TRADE REPORT - WEEK 1 (Week ending 23rd June) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trade well.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Good Thinking Jay! Does it now mean you enter 3 positions at the beginning of a signal so you can close the 1st at the ATR X1, the second at ATR X2 and the third trade is left to run. If this is the case, do you use same lot size in the different trades? I ask cos this is a modification of what we were doing before now.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Yeah, I updated the system on June 15th, post 185 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post11169897 Lot sizes are currently 0.5, 0.25, and 0.25, so as to equal 1 lot. However, I don't use the trailing stop loss or the 100 and 200 pip take profit targets anymore so I guess a version #4 is due at some point.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thanks Jay, i missed that post/point. Clear now.

Hi Jay, Thank you. Have a great weekend

Bitcoin Signal

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi Jay, great system, I've started following this one back end of last week. I notice how you've changed the rules a few times, what are your TP levels now, since you still open 3 positions I assume you have some rather than waiting for opposing signals? Also, do you not use a stop loss at all anymore? Just wait until opposing signals at the end of the day like you used to? If so, can you explain why? Don't you get scared that the market could move massively against you and potentially empty your account?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Please review from post #243 till now, I just explained this again... The market could move against my positions true, if it does not wipe me out in one day I'll simply close my positions as per the plan. I have stop-losses they are just not automatically placed on the chart. This is an evolving system of course and there probably will be changes in the future, there should be a link to the most recent iteration on post #1.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
BUY on BUY, close on SELL and SELL on SHORT - this is clear, OK Sorry for misunderstanding, but probably somebody can make it clear - we open sell order at SHORT, and then, do we have the same word BUY for both cases if we just close our previously opened at SHORT sell order and if we also have to open new buy (long) order...How can we understand the difference? I was looking at americanbulls and could not find the answer in their orders history. It looks like that every time we see word BUY following SHORT, we have to close sell order and open buy order immediately. But what about cases when we just close previous sell order without opening new order? Sorry again if my question was answered before...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hold on to your profits (or loss) until the next signal (stay in cash). Trade well.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Okay guys, market is on. Wishing us green pips this week. I Opened a demo TE (JAYmodified) for me to follow the signal generated. The modifications however are (1) i will be setting stop losses in mine (2) My TP is also modified (3) i wont use all signals generated as i hope to filter them before using. NOTE: This is my modification as it does not in any way affect the original system by Jay. My target is to use 0.1 lot total for every signal generated as i will be taking few of the signals. i want to see if it can double my account at the end of a month. Thanks

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Ah, apologies Jay you use the ATR. Thanks for clarifying. I've noticed that American Bulls site is down, hope it's just my connection and it comes back on by close of play tonight!

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Try to use Tor browser for connection, I can open americanbulls website only with Tor. Don't know reason for that.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi Jay, "...if it (the market) does not wipe me out in one day...". That's frightening Jay. What kind of capital do we actually need to trade using your system of 0.5, 0.25 and 0.25 lots? I understand that this is still a work-in-progress and I am sure you will figure a way out. I don't want to be wiped out. It can be pretty demoralising and will shatter your confidence. Thanks

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I would suggest reducing your total lotsize to an amount that makes you comfortable. For most that is about 2% of equity, that is probably where I would suggest that you start. After that, increase the size based upon results and personal preference. It's all dependant upon your risk profile.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Apparently, AmericanBulls is a sister site for a bunch of other similarly named sites which are country specific. I can see BritishBulls.com, FrancaisBulls.com, Mexicanobulls.com and a host of others. I suspect they detect your country via ip address or some other method and give you the site for the country that you are in or close to. If the forex information is the same at the sister sites, which appears to be the case, then you probably could just use the site that you are directed to.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi Uksoundsz. Americanbulls just gave me lots f HTML codes when I tried to enter their links. I too am from the UK and they do have a UKbulls which doesnt do that and will let you move around the site. Hope this helps Delta

--- 帖子 #268 ---
A couple of trade explorers based off of the CandleSticker system. https://www.forexfactory.com/oswaldmotape#acct.71 https://www.forexfactory.com/jereajali#acct.62 Each has made their own personal modifications to the system, which is excellent! Ultimately creating your own system that you are personally confident with is the best path to follow.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi Jay, A question: Since you began with this system, how would you say the trades that were left open over the weekend have fared overall? Thanks for sharing your idea with the community, I am paper trading this system as of last Friday, so in about 3-4 months I will have an idea of how the trades do when left open by Friday close. Thanks, wishing you and everyone on this thread success. FX-M

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks for the question, sometimes there is a good gap up to the account over the weekend and sometimes there is a gap down, overall in the end I think it evens itself out or even presents a small profit. Watching this for the past few months my preference is to see a small gap down after the weekend leading to a reversal in direction, but if I get a gap up that's fine too. Good luck with the paper trading and please inform us as to your conclusions when you have them.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
That works - much appreciated !

Now, Bitcoin signal is "stay long". Why?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi team, FYI: So as part of my paper trading test I am taking all signals as posted on American Bulls and doing my own analysis and noting on the side (PA with S/R and trend lines), I will then analyse winners and losers to see if the ones that are taken at S/R are more profitable than those taken in the middle of "nowhere" or not. May be a good filter. Cheers, FX-M

--- 帖子 #275 ---
So far so good. 1. check american bulls for signal 2. confirm pattern for entry on candlesticker 3. enter 4. enjoy the rest of the day. will revert with details thanks again Jay

Tough week so far!!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hahahaaaa.......for real! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
look at that drawdown my friend, got to filter those signals and reduce lot size

--- 帖子 #279 ---
agree. maybe not all signals are positive. choose those have &gt;60% winning rate pattern

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Jay try to filter the trades using myfxbook. There you could see retail positions. Look for % of retailers long vs short. If for example long positions are 70% or more than we go the other way we go short. ( so we trade against retail) But the volume must be above 5000 . In the pic. Usdcad is 88% short with 7466 volume above 5000. Everything is in order. So we are looking for longs. So if you get a candlestick pattern for long take it.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
You are thinking!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
JAY! Are you seeing this? Most signals changed at the end of yesterday's trade yet you did not exit

--- 帖子 #269 ---
...he is describing the system in another thread. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=761579 Trade well.

I am sure Jay has not said what he did, or did not do... Cheers.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Wer not here to read minds.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi Jay, Another observation, correlation of pairs may be a good thing to consider when taking trades. An example, looking at the charts GBPUSD, EURUSD and GBPJPY move in a similar fashion so taking positions in these pairs in opposing directions may be counterproductive, especially considering this system is about holding positions for a long time (one may get away with a short scalp or few hours in opposing directions cause they don't move in same direction pip-for-pip). So right now your GBPUSD/EURUSD short and GBPJPY long positions are kind of like being on both sides of the same trade. Cheers, and more pips' FX-M

--- 帖子 #273 ---
true, if you follow myfxbook like i described in previos post, it takes care of correlation and its perfect for long term, at least weekly.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I will try to absorb all these stuffs bro Jay but I know this is a big homework for me but I will try.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I wonder why AUDUSD did not receive SELL signal day before...SL level was hit and bearish candle closed below, as it was written on americanbulls BEARISH STOP LOSS. But still STAY LONG.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
very high drawdown

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yes, unbelievably so!!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
1. Check American Bulls for signal 2. confirm pattern for entry on Candlesticker 3. enter trade 4. profit target 80% of ATR(14) 5. ONE TRADE ONLY. 6. Rinse and repeat. was a green pip week. will try again next week.. thanks again Jay.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
We wait for the end of day and check if its candle closed below the bearish stop loss which in this case it did do just that as you mentioned but the market must do this twice. Meaning we wait for the next end of day to close below the previous new low created. If this thus happen I reckon AB will issue out a Sell signal for it but for now its still a long position. This is why we do not place the stop loss per jay's system. Jay am I correct?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks for reply, as far as I understand, even one-time daily close below SL should activate SELL. Two daily lows or one daily close. Probably my understanding is wrong, but it is strange to wait for the second daily close in minus... AB

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Where is thread author? Is this strategy still profitable? I see there are so many negative trades.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
The strategy is still profitable buddy.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hello Mr. Jay, I do not trade this system, however it has good potential. Study the strengths and weaknesses and make the necessary adjustments. Importantly, ACCEPT THE LOSSES! The sooner you do this the easier and more possible it is to recover. No capital=No trading! Cut it and shake off the mistake. Just friendly trader to trader advise. Bless.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
No. I think he blew up this account. Huge drawdown from past week.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Jay my friend, I am not a great trader but if i may give some advice - dont be in a hurry to get rich. You should never risk your entire account on one set of trades.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi All Missed signals Monday and havent seen any new ones. How yall doing?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Today XAUUSD Buy. I use demo account, just looking at drawdown. If you use normal MM 1-2% per trade, such drawdown would not kill your account. It necessary to watch at such system some months (as it is D1 timeframe) before making conclusions.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Finally he blew up his account.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
We all do right? At least once in a while. He did great though revealing how he trades. Very open minded guy.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
The system was, from the outset, shared with the intention of gaining lessons and, if possible, improve on it. It seems some people on this forum came with an "I told you so" mindset. Jay stated that he was open to, and had accepted, the possibility of the account blowing up, instead of feeling good about the account blowing up, take positives and tweak the system where you can!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
you did a good job. what you need to do is automate this system and try to find a good risk management setup. If you plan to automate this system, I can join

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Totally agree. Regardless of what has happened with Jay's trading, if anything, I am certainly appreciative of his generosity to come here and share what he does and how he does it. Having said that, I suspect that this thread is not dead, and will not die. Best to you Jay. Jump back in here when you are good and ready, and only then. Regards.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
The only problem i see is the signals from American Bulls. They are pretty lame. One Bitcoin signal was removed after one day which is untradable but they want to keep their average up. They seem to be a day late if you ask me. Instead why not read the chart yourself? ie open of GBP/ JPY June 29 candle is a hammer off the lower Bollinger band. That screams buy to me. Now bull flag so stay long. Personally I think you should trade the best 2 or 3 setups. The rest of Jay's plan seems to be working.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Yes, this is the main problem, from my view. Many signals are day late and untradable or poor tradable...But I still plan to continue demo trading with proper MM. My DD now is about 20%, trading since 10 June. If I keep MM strictly 1% per order, DD could be about 7-10%, I think.

I think the Am. Bulls signals can be filtered by incorporating S/R and following the trend. I am going to adjust my paper trading account in this way to see how it performs.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I was reading an article about that ... the author said that trading without a stop-loss was like driving thru town and running all the red lights and stop signs ... you will get to where you're going quicker, but sooner or later, -------.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hello JayDavis, I believe a semi automated version of the 3 Tier London breakout Ea can really help improve(manage) this system. This EA works wonders when properly managed(made to trade in the direction of a trend) although some changes need to be made to enable it keep some trades until you get a sell order from Americanbulls. Please back test it on any pair in the direction of the trend and let me know what you think.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I have been trading without stop losses for over a year and its made me way more profit... Price will go up and down throughout a trade, you have to give it plenty of room to do that. If you read your charts and indicators, you will be smart enough to know when and when not to get into a trade. I only trade two pair, and I am telling you, if you stare at only two pair for over a year, you get to know its movement pretty well. Also without a stop loss, you have to do smaller lot sizes to withstand the movement and not test your margin call. Also patients! You have to trust your strategy. … Now if you are a beginner and you are trying to find your strategy and what works for you, then hell yeah! Put a stop loss on there. …. Traders like Warren Buffett did not become billionaires with tight stop losses.

Hi guys, As promised. The Trend indicator

Hi guys, The compiled version of the forex entry point

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi guys, This is how the system looks like I have uploaded the template as well.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi guys, Since i am in the mood of sharing, i decided to share position size calculator. It is very useful calculating the lot size depending on your risk tolerance. It will help us when placing the stop loss, take profit per my modification. You just specify %Risk and where you place your SL and TP and it will then calculate the following for you: reward and reward/risk and position size

Hi guys, So that we are clear I will be trading the system live next year January 2019 using the modified version of jay's system. Please also check my personal trading journal: The workings of a well crafted trading plan on $205 account

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi guys, If you have made you own modifications to the Jay's system please do share and show its TE so that we can all work together shaping this system. The works works, just needs a few tweaks here and there. Please do not hesitate!!!!!!!! Jay will be coming back soon!!

Few trades confirmed by AB but only USDCAD is looking good thus far. i am monitoring it based on my own modification as posted few days back. MA cross and forex entry on daily frame got confirmed but waiting for trend indicator and forex entry on 4hr to follow before stalking the 15 minutes forex entry.

Revealing which direction you intend to trade based on candle patterns just seems like a bad idea nowadays. Especially since these candle patterns are widely known and popular so "you" in this case isn't only you, it's a huge population of traders following the same pattern and I'm sure this is exploited by market makers.

I have been slacking on the paper trading account so I haven't come up with any clear pattern of results, I have been largely focused on my own live account

This has nothing to do with candlestick patterns....I also want other things.... Beer, good TEs and Oktoberfest!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Ok, I'm back, sorry about the ghosting, ready to try something new!

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Jay, So glad to see you back. Not sure why you are trying something new though. I thought you did fantastic , and no system is 100%. Maybe your just a 'High Acheiver' Don't be hard on yourself. I think we all expect losses - although not sure you had losses - the market turned and bam. What about when it didn't. We've all blown our accounts up and usually long before with not such great history behind us. Again glad your back, I still look at your system. But you gave me the wobbles when you took off - shouldnt have done. Dont think I've come across a better one.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Thanks for the understanding, working on a system that randomly takes trades and I just monitor when I want to close the orders.

After Action Lesson Please use a reputable Broker. Another lesson that I had to painfully learn with my system was that the broker that I was using (realtrade) and had been using for years was crap. When I held profits of over 10 grand in my account and I requested withdrawal of a relatively small amount ($1,000) all I received was crickets. Ultimately I realized that I would never see a dime of my winnings. Don't use realtrade or any broker that is not properly regulated, you may never see your money. I hate to throw them under the bus, but when I realized that I would never see my money, I took crazy risks, it seemed like I was trading a demo account.

Hi Jay, Thanks for putting us wide on this one !! Many people wouldn't have, most would have left it - this information is invaluable to all traders experienced and novices. Thanks again.
