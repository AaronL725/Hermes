Welcome Team Aphid! Im curious, excited and ready for "The Bat". Lets see if it beats some pips out of the markets Bluefish

--- 帖子 #20 ---
And thank you for sharing Regards

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thank you for the compliments, Dial. And welcome all to our new thread. TeamAphid believes the base of BAT system is good, it is profitable with good winning ratios and it works well especially with trending currencies. Yes, it is mainly a trend following system but it also aims to profit in ranging markets. The indicator was developed by TeamAphid for Mt4. Why do we release this system? First, we believe Forex Factory is the best forum and we love to contribute it. Second, as Dial indicated, we would like to get some feedback from all valuable members of Forex Factory, novice or experienced, to see if we can further refine this method and make more profitable for all of us. During discussions, we'll point out the areas especially that will need refining or further improvement. We are ready to post the strategy document and the indicator, but we are making some modifications to charts for better understanding and we will post them as soon as possible. We hope we will all have positive discussions and everybody will benefit. And we will try to answer all your questions promptly. See you soon, Cheers, TeamAphid

Welcome, make yourselves feel at home.... A

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Sounds interesting - a trend following system - hmm Look forward to your strategy &amp; postings Kind Regards Steve

--- 帖子 #24 ---
This forum is getting more interesting!!! Welcome Team Aphid

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I think everyone is going to like The Bat. I've had it several months now, and I have to say it is a unique method, unlike any I've seen posted at the Factory before. Team Aphid definitely knows how to think outside the box! Dial

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Dial, Comparing 'The Bat' and yr 'Knife', which one has better win/loss rate ?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Team Aphid Cant wait to try my hand on your system and i hope i could contribute soemthing to better improve your system.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Welcome Team Aphid!! I look forward to your material!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Depends on the trader. The trader is the most volatile and unpredictable component of any system. Sam does better with the Knife than with the Bat. Jane does better with the Bat than with the Knife. What is Robert supposed to think? He thinks nothing. He trades both and compares HIS results to HIS results; not to Sam's or Jane's or anyone elses. Dial P.S. Everyone, This is Team Aphid's thread, so I'm going to butt out now. Ciao!

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Don't know how much more I can absorb , but if Dial say it's worth looking at then that's good enough for me

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Wow...what a great idea! Thank you so much maybe I should change my signature to 'Spread-Batting' ?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Wowww, sounds interesting......

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Interesting Diallist! At then end of the day we all end up trading what we are most comfortable with anyway.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
OMG...Welcome Team Aphid.....Welcome!!! I can't wait to get more. I hope to be a valuable contribution to your work. Bernadette!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi Everyone, Great to see so many enthusiastic people here. The main posters in Team Aphid will be me...Athena ( Hi! ) and Zeus and Hermes. We will try and answer your questions as best we can and we know there will be a few (as other TA members had them!) Read the PDF and set up the charts and let us know what you think. Happy reading and trading. Athena Diallist you are ALWAYS more than welcome on this thread! ps. Please excuse any errors.( page 4 fixed- 2 errors page 4 - 17/1/06)

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Very nice stuff. My father is in heaven now. He trades with this type of approach, but never had a very systematic approach as well thought out as this. He's super excited to test this! He doesn't post but told me to say thank you for him. Best, Mike

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks for the system and indicator! Just one question for now. This indicator doesn't "repaint" itself or change over time, does it? I assume not, since it's based on ATR and since you mentioned backtesting it. But I wanted to make sure. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
No FXLogic, the indicator does not repaint itself or change over time. And blue line never decreases in value and red line never increases, so they are very good in trailing the market. That's why this is a trend following system and it is also capable to profit from sideways action (range trading) by additions made by TeamAphid.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thanks for the reply! "Repainted" indicators are also worthless if you want to look at old charts and/or backtest. So I'm glad to know it's reliable. Just looked over the PDF. Nice system and idea. I've thought about similar ways to exploit trends and retracements, but haven't ever come up with something like that. John

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Just wanted to get my welcome in ....

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hey Team, I'm looking forward to The Bat and hopefully can contribute positively to the thread! 1Trader2

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Good Stuff. Have you got any stats on your testing? Like win percent and maybe average win and average loss? Of various pairs.. Of course with your names on it, it is a sure bet it will be top notch... Thanks much, Scott

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Welcome TeamAphid and thank you for the BAT, I have just downloaded the pdf and will be going through it tonight.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thankyou very much team Aphid. i really like the way you use the fibs here. I have a question though. After entering a trade you place a stop above/below the recent swing high/low. Now if after placing a trade price then breaks the opposite BAT line but does not hit the stop then do we just ignore the BAT line in this case and leave our stop at the original swing/high low +/- 10 pips, or should we reverse at that point. The atatched chart of the current GBP/USD 1hr illustrates what i am trying to say. We should already be short 1 lot now if price retraces to the 61.8 then it would also break the red BAT line. So do we ignore the BAT line in this case? Thanks, Wiz. PS. The current open trade has nothing to do with the BAT.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yes it works in both markets...trend and range. Thanks TA!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Is this viable on other timeframes, such as the M15? James16 people should know what I'm talking about here. I was trying to work it out on this timeframe but couldnt quite get it right.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Please post backtesting results, and more importantly, forward tested results for at least three months.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks smjones. Yes, we have stats, win percents, total pips, average loss and average win. We are updating those info as well for FF community and we'll post the spreadsheet asap.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
No rush. Thanks for the great work..

--- 帖子 #50 ---
We do not ignore BAT line at all. In your case, if price retraces to the 61.8 fib, it will hit the red BAT line before touching 61.8 fib level. So you will reverse the position when the price hits BAT line (cancel your pending orders you put to go short from 61.8 fib line) and you will be long with 1 lot. So AFTER ATR line passes through fib lines, it acts as a trailing stop. This means ATR line has priority. This also answers your first question. But if, for a short position let's say, BAT line is still above the swing high +10pips, then we use swing high +10pips as stoploss and then wait for the price to hit red BAT line to go long. We hope this is not confusing.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi Squash, we tested other timeframes as well and when you use lower timeframes, like most of the other indicators, you get more signals and more loser trades (but smaller losses of course). The reverse is true for longer timeframes. Therefore, we found 1hr time frame is the most suitable to trade.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
We will asap. And the results before July 2006 are only backtests. We have been trading this system since July 2006 in a trading account with real money, so the results from July 2006 to today will be forward test results in that sense.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks for your reply. I'll start some testing tonight and see how it goes. This type of method suits me perfectly so thanks again for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks for that. You have answered my question. Makes perfect sense.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I guess I am confused. Price never actually punches through the BAT lines. Now, the BAT lines do tend to run with the prices, but I never see price go through the BAT line . So what do you mean by that? That it's parallel with the line? Furthermore, when you get opposite BAT lines that write, they are above the price, so how will you ever get a signal since price doesn't go through them?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Please see the chart The Wizard of Oz attached ( post 44). Price touches the blue BAT line which means you will go short and then swings around the blue line. You are short with 1 lot and getting ready to go short 1 more lot if price retraces to 61.8 fib line and short 2 more lots if price retraces to 38.2 fib lines. While you have pending orders for these additional short positions, the red BAT line starts its downward move and passes through fib lines. It first passes through 38.2 fib line and at that stage you will cancel your pending order to go short with 2 lots. If, at the close of 1 hr bar, it passes through 61.8 fib level, then you will cancel your remaining pending order and then just watch red BAT line with one lot. Whenever price hits this red BAT line, then you will exit your one lot and reverse position and go long with one lot. One reminder, the level of BAT line changes in current 1hr bar, but it is fixed starting from the previous bar backward. So you need to use previous bar's BAT level as a reference to reverse the position, as explained in pdf document. If price never actually punches through the BAT lines, as you indicated, then we cannot have this system as there will be no signals. Actually, it does continuously, please check sample charts (charts 1, 2, 4) to see how price passes through or hits BAT lines. Sorry for the confusion, we hope it is clear now.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I just PM'ed you about a potential issue

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Just as a heads up, there is a typo (at least I think) on page 4. It says "They will be SHORT trades". According to the chart, they should be long trades as short trades would not make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the system though.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hmmm...for shorter timeframes you do have more losers...hi TA, just a lingering question, have u considered using 55ema curve filter to saw out probable losing trades for the smaller timeframes?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I noticed this also. Thought I might be going crazy. :

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks Squash and Loki...typo fixed!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Well I have to say so far the results have been phenomenal. I just finished manually backtesting Jan 2006 and the results are a net of 606 pips!!!!! I did however count the two lot trades as twice the pips, i.e. if you made 50 pips trading the two lots I counted it as 100 pips to make counting things up easier. I'm still working on backtesting up through the current date, so I can't tell if January is just a freakishly good month or not, but Team Aphid is correct when they say this system takes pips from both trending and ranging markets. I think it is the first system that I have ever seen that can make that claim. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK TEAM APHID!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thanks for your suggestion. Actually we did not consider to add more indicators as we prefer "simple is better". And as TeamAphid, almost all of our other studies are based on longer time frames, even daily ones. But if you can explain in detail how we can use 55ema curve filter to saw out probable losing trades, we are, of course, ready to test your idea. That's why we are sharing this system with valuable FF members, to improve BAT further and make it more profitable. So we are open to ideas.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Note: you have changed SHORT to LONG, but there is also another error - the stop loss will be 10 pips under the LOW in this case, not 10 pips above the HIGH

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanks Xerof, we are aware, and it is being taken care, now.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thanks Loki, let me tell you this, out of 13 months backtests, GBPUSD has just one month with negative pips result. So if you look from monthly perspective, winning ratio is 92.30%, but this figure is, of course, much lesser for individual trades or daily basis. But, if you are after consistent winning month after month, by using correct money management techniques, BAT looks very promising, in our opinion.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Feburary 2006 didn't fare so well, -176 pips. The system would still be up over 400 pips however. March ended up +9 pips for a total of 413 pips (including commissions) since January 2006. Off to bed.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Actually we have different results and both months were positive.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Team Aphid, Just a ramble...this tid bit is probably old news to you but i've found it is nice to have the price in my FiboRetracement tool's description, you might too? The addition of the following will show price on any line on the tool: %$ what you are adding is the %(percent)$(dollar) symbols on the line. so the description will read: SWING 1.9688 .....or whatever the zero line on the fibo tool is set at. Then add that code to any fibo description that you are entering a unit or taking profits for easy trade station order management. Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Would you guys be willing to post your trades (just numbers would work fine) for one of the two months? I need to figure out what I'm doing wrong. I followed the system to the letter as I understand it from the PDF, with no discretionary trades or additional filters. Granted picking the top/bottom for the Fibo lines can be subjective but I can't see them making that huge of a deal.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks for this improvement Thom, we are sure it will enhance the visual of charts and help users of BAT system.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi all, since i was in a doodlin mood and read in the PDF file the suggestion to set up MT4 "Alarms" i did a quick hack on a simple horizontal line audio alert that you can download from my server in this directory: http://accrete.com/fx-bat/ The BAT_Red_Alert.mq4 and it's sound file red-bat-alert.wav should be placed at the red bat line and then do the same for the for the " Blue_Alert " %&amp; " blue-bat " pair. You will place the .wav files into the MT4's "sounds" directory. When you first place the indicators on a chart the line will show up at the current price, just sellect it and drag it to the corresponding colored "Bat Line" and you are good to go! POST SCRIPT: I just added one called "BAT_Alert.mq4" and it's wave file "bat-alert.wav" this one is purple and can be placed anywhere you wish like a take profit areas or others. ...as i post the PS note i've alread gotten into my first BAT Trade long...but i accidentaly got in 10 pips prior to the 1hr's level as i was on the 30m chart by accident. : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks again, Thom.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
We are attaching Feb 2006 backtest results so that you can compare.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I have a silly sort of question that has to do with the color scheme. Now what i'm rambling on below has nothing to do with tweaking the model in any way, it is only a color/visual que on the existing lines. I can imagine, though never using an ATR indicator, that the upper "red" line was originaly intended as some sort of Stop and Reverse line of sorts? and vice versa for the lower blue line. But reading through the PDF file that is not the case in this model which is fine. It took two reads to "get it". What was throwing me off mentaly was the visual Que of the Red line which historicaly ment to me that the color red was a "Bearish" signal, and a blue one was "Bullish". Just wondering if switching the colors would make easier sense to newbies that might be looking at "Blue" candles as "Bulls" and "Red" as "Bears" which is very typical of a trade station setup these days... the sky is blue they say (unless you live in Oregon like i do and i just have to guess it's blue above the cloud cover!). It makes perfect visual sense to me to "Go Long" when a "Sky is Blue" line is breached going up... and to "Go Short" when a "Earth is Red" line is breached going down. I know, my wife says i'm waaaaaay to much of a detail kinda guy. But at least i don't line all the labels up in the cupboard and she is still sleeping with me after 2 dozen years. grin. : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #76 ---
that was the first thing i did with this indicator. switching red and blue

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Of course, you can switch colours. But when we see the red line on chart, we understand that bears are in control and vice versa. If you look at it from signal point of view, then you are right.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Yup, the "control" verses the "signal" viewpoints were my brain's mixup/confusion. Since i was looking at the lines as entry "signals" my mind was looking for "blue" for long, but my eyes were seeing red! I know it's no big deal, but if we ever got into posting charts it could throw ppl off for sure, guess i'll just put a disclaimer for the color blind if we ever have a thread to post trades/chart examples. : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi TeamAphid, Thanks very much! To confirm what I understand from the document: Price merely needs to break through the opposite Bat line for the current trade to be stopped out, correct? i.e. we do not need to wait for the current candle/bar to close. If not, how does the indicator handle price retraces back across a bat line (and what should the trader's corresponding actions be)? Thanks, BlueMeasure

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Yes, price needs to break through the opposite Bat line for the current trade to be stopped out, that is correct and and you don't need to wait for the current candle/bar to close. After breaking through the opposite BAT line, you have to wait for next bar to be able to see the new BAT line (in the mean time, put your limit orders for fib retracement trades, as you already know the swing high/low). Whenever a BAT line is hit, you have nothing to do with it anymore and start watching the new BAT line and it appears with next 1hr bar with a certain margin. We have never seen a case such as price breaks through the opposite BAT line and then retraces and drops like a stone before formation of a new BAT line next hour. We hope we have answered what you asked. Otherwise, can you please explain in detail preferably with a chart.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Apologies in advance for my many posts... this is a question on "BAT Range Trade" On page 8 of the PDF file it states: My confusion is the language of the "161.8 level". If i draw a fibo with the "Entry" 100% level set at the red line and the "Swing" 0% level up at the recent high before the short entry at the 1.9740ish level, then the 161.8 level should be south of my short entry? Then why is the trade no longer valid when it reaches the 161.8 level? If i've drawn my fibo correctly it would be well in profit and be categorized as a "Full Monty" trade?? What am i misinterpreting? Thanks in advance for any clarification...hey it's 1:30 am Pacific and i've been up since this morning so i'm a bit sleepy. But i'm in profit w/pips locked in so i'll sleep well ! Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi TeamAphid, Thanks very much! You write “ The ‘Full Monty’ Bat Trade. ………………………… Exits for trades 2,3 and 4 are placed at the same time as the pending orders are placed and the targets are the original entry level which is 9337.” Why you exit for trades 2,3 and 4 is on the original entry level??? You are on correct side for long trade and can get a big profit with trades 2,3,4. But you kill your potential profit. Why??? May be do you want to get break even and small profit for trade1? But if it’s true – you can close 1 or 2 lots and get it. Or is it for range market??? Can you explain? 2.If I’m right in my first question (if it’s for range market) can we add lots above “trade1” but below 161.8? 3.What about 4 Hour Charts. I’m using 4 Hour Charts for my systems. Can you advise The BAT parameters for 4H. 4. What about MM??? When we open “trade 1” we must to know how many lots should we take. If price is going down (for long) we have loss for our deposit and we can’t buy more lots. Or we must to do this: if for “trade 1” we can buy 8 lots we buy only 2 (8/4=2) Can you explain? 5.What about MM method? I believe if we use ATR we should use ATR for our MM: Volatility = Average(Range, Period), Number of lots = % volatility * Capital / Asset_volatility For instance, we have a capital of $ 100000 and wish to buy AAA stocks. The average true range for several days was $0.1 or $10 per lot. If we limit the volatility of our account to 10%, then we can buy a maximum of 1000 lots. Thus we can control the possible fluctuations of every element of the portfolio I only want to understand it better! Thanks! Max

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi TeamAphid, Thanks for the reply. I've attached the current GBPUSD 1 hour chart. The second last bar touched and broke the the red (bearish) Bat line which takes us out of the short trade we were in (please correct me at any point). Price retraced and closed below the Bat line however and no blue (bullish) bat line has been drawn (as yet) on the new bar. Now, we're out of the short trade and presumably opened a long trade. The fact that the price retraced however worries me about going long at this point (not-withstanding the GBP news announcement at this time). In other words, has that short trade been totally invalidated? So, I suppose the question in all of this is what happens if price should now head south in a major way (which is possible if this last swing up was just a retrace)? As I understand it, this system wouldn't get us back in on the short side until a blue line appears and that could be quite a ways down looking back at what happened historically on the chart. Just thinking out loud now, but zooming out and looking at the bigger picture for e.g. trend and price action might be helpful to filter out trades with low potential. Sorry for rambling a bit, but intuitively it feels likes there's some sort of filtering missing although I understand your past results are excellent. Any insights would be much appreciated, BM

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks for your posts, Thom. First, you are correct in stating that for short entries, 161.8 level will be south of the entry level. If price hits 161.8 level and then starts retracing back to 61.8 and 38.2 levels, we observed that the price generally hits the opposite BAT line and we lose many pips. So it is a kind of trailing rule; if 161.8 level is hit, then cancel your 61.8 and 38.2 level limit orders. Therefore, when 161.8 level is hit and your pending limit orders are cancelled, then there is no possibility that you will have a Full Monty trade (because you can't have 4 lots anymore). To have Full Mothy trade, you need to close all 4 lots in profit. So it depends on when 161.8 level will be hit, before 61.8 and 38.2 hit (then no possibility for Full Monty trade) or after 61.8 and 38.2 hit (then it is quite possible that you will have a Full Monty trade.

It will be easier if we put answers between the lines with blue font.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
This is a completely mechanical system. So, short trade has been completely invalidated today at 8:00 bar (Alpari time). As you can see, blue BAT line has formed and it is horizontal now at 1.9576 and it will never drop below that level so your risk is defined. If price heads south now, you will buy 1 lot at 61.8 level and 2 lots at 38.2 level. If price hits 1.9576, then you will reverse your position and go short with 1 lot. You have to wait next 1hr bar after price hits BAT line to see the opposite BAT line. You are right that this system wouldn't get you back in on the short side until a blue line appears, but it always appears with next hourly bar and we have never met such a case that price dropped like a stone just after touching red BAT line.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
TA. I cannot match your entries and exits using ATR 5 and factor 4. Your results seem to be using a tighter BAT line. If I use ATR 5 and factor 3 then the results are a lot closer to yours. So my question then is, what ATR and factor were you using to get those results? Thanks in advance, Wiz.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Thanks for your answers!!!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Team Aphid and all, I've been absorbing great mountains of information for several months now, and been following some of the systems that have developed over that time. I really like the look of this, totally mechanical and seems to make sense to me. Thanks TA for sharing this! I've attached a chart showing entries according to my understanding of the rules. I just wanted to check that they are correct. I know I've highlighted a bad run, but looking back quickly there seems to be some very sweet runs also. This is my first go at posting a chart so apologies if it doesn't work out... PS Just noticed I drew in the S/L for the 4 lots in the wrong spot, should be last low -10 pips, oops. But the result is the same. Also its not that clear perhaps (still learning) but I was trying to indicate the 4 long positions being stopped out.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I just deleted my stupid question. Great effort. Who is going to start the new Bat Challenge? And I thought since I had left the PF I would miss out on anything you may offer in the future, man am I relieved.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Wiz Different MT4 platforms will in fact produce very different results in this method. The settings we are using are ATR Period 5 and Factor 4 on Alpari data. Who are you using for data?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Yes, I suppose it's a matter of trusting the system - not easy to do initially when it's not yours. Sorry if my questions seemed to doubt the validity of the Bat strategy. I'm showing the blue line at 1.9548 with a factor of 4. Reducing the factor to 3.5 puts the line at 1.9578. Could you please confirm that the factor should indeed be 4 as outlined in the pdf? Thanks, BM

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Works amazingly nice. let's start mass back and forward testing! As it is a purely mechanical system, it would not be hard to make an EA from it. Many thanks, TeamAphid, for sharing your ideas. Best regards, Piccolo PS - a full monty sample attached.. chart is up to this moment.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi Grrowler You are right, this is a fine example of being stopped out on what eventuated in a nice long trade. We have come across this a few times and we are looking into a system of re entry. One example is that once we are stopped out of all four trades and price returns to the swing line of 9341 we could pick up trades again...recover our losses from the previous losing trade and still have a trade ( or two) left to go long. What do you think?

Hope this helps

lol, by mistake I made the same trade profitable as your discussed loss and re-entry. my mistake was that I drew the fibo line to the low point but not the most recent low.. making more breathing room for the trade that would have resulted in a full monty trade. My mistake.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I found it quite hard to read your chart. It does take a bit of patience and practice to get the hang of this system and nothing beats watching it in real time and demo trading. Here is my chart of the current BAT trade on GBPUSD on ALPARI data. See how the blue line waits an hour before it starts to form?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
In that case your settings will never match ours. Either switch to Alpari or be aware that yours will always differ.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I'm on IBFX also, and my blue bat line is @ 1.9607. using the settings per the instructions. TA says Alpari shows 1.9576. We're going to quite different entry and exit points, it seems. Or would it be beneficial to open a demo with Alpari and trade from that?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks for answering my question while I was still asking it.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I have just tested this using 3 Lots bought/sold at the Bat Line rather than adding them with any Fib Retracement and took profits at the 161, 216 and as Aphid does at the next Bat Fly-By. Results for Feb +756pips ( am I wrong? ) Results for March 06 were a staggering 1441pips ( please check ) The Bat results by comparison were +482 ( please double check ) Also if the price retraced back to the original buy/sell after making it to the 161 the lots were closed out without taking a loss. If they did not make the 161 then a loss was booked as per Ahpids intial posts. Hi Aphid did you ever test this way? If so did it not work out long term? Am I just doing it wrong?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
FF resized it. here is the full picture: http://piccolo.burti.lv/journal_img/...sentiment6.gif I know it is wrong as the SL would have been too big.

You are welcome!!!!!

Thanks TA for the reply, The re-entry idea sounds interesting, it could blow a massive hole in your pipbank if it then fails again though. An example on the 21/12/2006 would have resulted in an approx. 328 pip loss, plus losing 18pips X no. lots we re-entered with, before receiving an opposite entry signal. This is perhaps a bad time of the year to be looking at. And I guess also that it is a small loss compared to the massive gain we would get by being in that long trade you posted. Please don't think I'm criticizing BAT at all, I think it looks great.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I just set everything up on the Alpari demo server. The Alpari chart is showing the blue bat line @ 1.9605- only a one pip difference from IBFX. I'm on the GPBUSD 1 HOUR chart... ATR=5, Factor= 4.0. What have I done wrong?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I have the upper line (red) at 1.9648 (one pip difference from TA) and the lower (blue) at 1.9578 I am using InterbankFX demo feed. Are you sure you have GBPUSD 1H open?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
No this is not wrong as you can use your own discretion when drawing the fib lines. If you are comfortable trading with this size stop and giving price plenty of room to move then that is fine also. When trading this real time ( demo) you will soon get a feel for what suits you. You will also see that it does not take long for your stops to be moved to the blue line on the long trade (during which time you will pick up your retracement trades) and this trade will end as a full monty.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I just did April 06 now and reckon I come up 439 pips for the 3 lot buy/sell and +270pips for the Pure Bat. Am I close to the mark Aphid with your actual results for March and April? And if anyone is checking my effort, am I wrong? It really catches the big runs, would I have the staying power to hang on? Based on my past efforts, I would say definately not. I would have been so excited to see 50pips I would have bailed.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
TA, thank you so much for your time and efforts in this thread, much appreciated! IBFX feed here also as they are GMT 00:00 and i like that as i'm at the charts at London Open ...and it lines up with 08:00 on the charts : ) and trading off the FXSolutions trade station as my accounts are w/them. In the long run i would not think the few pips would matter. : ) Thom

Hi, my name is Michael! Is great to see such a great team on forex factory. i would like to join your team and be a part. I think i have good things to give and more to learn from you. What should i do to be a part? Thank you! Succes in your trades!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Not at all!!!! Look at Piccolos' trade via his link where he drew the fib to a low of two days previous giving this trade plenty of room and then this trade ends in a full monty.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Trading on another platform really is fine it ...is just that when ppl are trying to match their trades and entries with ours that they must realise this is impossible if they are on a different data feed. btw Thank you Thom!!!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
BTW, is anyone in the last long entry? I really want to stick to the pure system, but my feeling is the bulls are running out of steam, and want to put on a tp. Maybe its just my emotions playing with me again. Whats the general concensus? TA?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I know they can't be perfect , but we're talking about a thirty pip discrepency. I'm looking at IBFX and Alpari demo platforms which are nearly the same, but my numbers are still way different than yours. I just wanted to figure out if I'm doing something wrong with my setup or whatever. Something has to be different other than the data feeds.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
So you are going to add discretion to a mechanical system? I do not think you will be trading this system anymore, if you were to do this.... Yours would be a hybird. For me, I think I would trade it as is for a while and get a feel for it behind the wheel so to speak.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
smjones, thanks, point taken. Thats what I needed. Naughty emotions!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
This is one of the reasons we have opened this system to FF community. We believe it can be improved and become even more profitable. So, feel free to change number of lots traded, profit levels, stop levels etc. We haven't tested it this way. But looks interesting, we'll test it at least for Feb and March to see if we have a match with you. Thanks for new ideas.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
We should also remind you that TeamAphid does not trade between December 20th and January 2nd due to holiday conditions. Therefore, our results exclude these dates.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Our March result is +698 pips and April result is +327 pips. Will post results as soon as we finish updating them. We are also preparing results for other pairs we would recommend to trade with BAT system. For the time being, in order for everyone to understand the system better, we have limited the discussion for GBPUSD only. Thank you for your understanding.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi Michael. Thank you for your generous offer. But we believe FF is the best place to learn and we are trying to contribute as much as we can. And if you think you have good things to give, why don't you share your ideas here as we do so that everybody in the forum will try to improve them. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
As TeamAphid, we totally agree with you. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Current blue line is at 1.957660 right now on Alpari. But the previous blue line (ended on Jan 16th at 15:00hr) was at 1.960460. We, all team members, see the same values now.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
would be very nice if you could backtest and send more months...very usefull for understanding how system is working...and be convinced about long term profitability... I think that for a good programmer, building an expert should be possible thanks for sharing this nice and original ssytem emeric

--- 帖子 #125 ---
We will. Please see post #120.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Thom, Thanks for the great wav. Alert. Is it possible to add an email option? While I am tied to a computer at work all day long my Trade Station is set up at home. I use VNC to access it but the sound doesn’t work over the Viewer. It would also be very helpful to receive an email alert at night while sleeping. I envy those who have been successful enough to trade full time. I have tried to learn to program or at least modify code before to add the email functionality but with no luck. Can anyone suggest a programming class that would best prepare me for MT4 code? In this case it would be best if the alert could be set up to email when ever price crosses the blue or red line. Thanks for all of your help over the years.

Hi all!!! It's very, very interesting to find correct point for "Swing" dot. It's very, very interesting to make hand backtesting. But, IMHO, we have a smaaaal problem. TA asks that we try to make this system better with our ideas. I think we must to start not from looking for Swing dots or trying to find "best month of 2006" We must to make correct MM system for the Bat! It must be first. Look at this. Trade 1 entry 9337 exit 9373 SL=88 Trade 2 entry 9307 exit 9337 SL=58 Trade 3 entry 9289 exit 9337 SL=40 Trade 4 entry 9289 exit 9337 SL=40 Stop loss 9249 If we open or trade on Trade#1 dot with our full lots with 2or3% Risk by Deposit we can't to trade Trade2,3,4 - we HAVE FULL RISK from the beginning. Example for unders tanding Our depo = $10 000 Risk 3% (I’m sorry Fiji J ) 1. Take all lots. With mini lots Our lots for Trade1 = $300/88=3 Our lots for Trade2 = $300/58=5 Our lots for Trade3 = $300/40=7 Our lots for Trade4 = $300/40=7 AND!!! If we will take all this lots we will have 12% Risk!!! 2. Lots distribution. With micro lots Our lots for all Trades = $300/88=30 We can distribute it pro rata 2.1. For Trade#1=coef 1 30/4=7 Our lots for Trade1 = 7 Our lots for Trade2 = 7 Our lots for Trade3 = 7 Our lots for Trade4 = 7 But we have problem again. We close it on Trade#1 price and loss our money that we can get from trend. Yes, we don’t know about future prices. But we don’t know about future when we trade Trade2,3,4. We can book profit from 4 lots or we can get loss from 4 lots. I think we must to look the other way 2.2.For Trade#1=coef 2 (TA told that we trade Trade1 with 2 lots) 30/5=6 Our lots for Trade1 = 12 Our lots for Trade2 = 6 Our lots for Trade3 = 6 Our lots for Trade4 = 6 In this we can’t book our profit!!! 3. Look again ( I know, I’ve bothered you J ) Trade 2 entry 9307 exit 9337 SL=58pips TP=30pips P/L=0.51 Trade 3 entry 9289 exit 9337 SL=40 TP=48 P/L=1.13 Trade 4 entry 9289 exit 9337 SL=40 TP=48 P/L=1.13 Total p/l=0.9 It’s not very well. We must take trades with p/l&gt;1 (&gt;2better) Thanks! It’s only my IMHO and not criticism – I want to make this better! Max

--- 帖子 #128 ---
This may be a bit of an over simplification, but if you've determined your max risk per trade to be 3%, then you should simply open each of the 4 possible lots with .75%. This will bring the max risk for a full monty position to your desired 3%.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi TeamAphid I have been reading through this post with interest and wanted to thank you for THE BAT method and to assure you of my support for the team. Best Regards, Cosmo II

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Michael This is correct for the first part of his comments which is MM, what about the 2nd part which is the issue of risk reward ratio and in the case of trades 2,3 and 4 it is less than 1?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Team Aphid, Thanks and nice system. Definetly thinking outside the box. Just a question and I'm sure you have thought of this. If we look at the last trade on the blue line, we placed the FIB lines on and saw that the 61.8 and 38 lines were outside the red forming line (if I am understanding your system correctly). In your work would this be a low probability trade? Yesterday range was also low and we had a breakthrough of the blue line late in the day. Would these two signs signal a lower percentage trade?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Mark The fib levels which you mention cannot fall outside the red line, because at the time you put on the fibs the forming red line has been the horizontal bit at the top only. I hope I am not mistaken, of course the Team will reply in due course.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Howard, Good point my mistake. But what about this one from the 9th of Jan.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
You are right on this one, one of the fib lines is outside the red line at the time when you placed them.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Team Aphid, In your trading would you also take counter trend trades? As with these two.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi MarkJ &amp; Howard, You have now got me curious as well! What I'm trying to figure out from your examples is that at the time of trade entry, the opposite bat line doesn't start to show up until the next hour. So can you really tell if the fib levels are outside of the bat line before entering a trade? Where did I get off track? Trying to ponder probabilities as well! Thanks, Lyn

--- 帖子 #137 ---
LOL- I was looking at yesterday's line. The new line- (1.957) was below the screen- I had to "pinch" it to see it. Sorry for the grief. ken

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Lyn That is what we are seeing on the chart historically after the event, we have not seen it in real time, the Team who have watched it live at the time would be in a better position to explain what decision should be taken if we come across a case where fibs are located outside the red or blue lines.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
1.Yes. You are right! I describe it in my post on 2.1. and 2.2. But you must don't forget that if you don't resieve maximum from your invest. capital you should to change your Tactics. If you can to take 3% Risk on your depo in this enter tactics (i don't know is this word correct) you take only .75% and LOST your money. Not get=lost. 2.TA told that they sell 4 lots on Trade#1 for booking profit. If we use .75% per enter it's true. But TA told that they take 2lots on Trade#1. In this case you CAN't book your profit. 3.When we get loss we get full loss with 4 lots. When me get profit we get full profit on 1 lots. I don't want to say that the BAT system is bad system. NOT! It's very very fine...idea for my and system for other people. Why idea and not system? For my IMHO system must have: 3.1Entry rules – the BAT has it – very simple and based on real market volatility (it means that it will be work not only on Forex) 3.2.Exit rules - the BAT has it – very simple and based on real market volatility 3.3.Stop loss rules - the BAT has it – very simple and based on real market volatility 3.4.MM system – This MM system must make big profits and small loses – RR must be&gt;1. The BAT MM rules has correct enter but not correct exit (again – it’s MY IMHO) 3.5 Rules of management of open trade – system must tell you what you should do when your trade is in development – the BAT don’t tells it. I want to build all this “breaks” and get System I believe that TA want too ;-)

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Markj, here is my understanding, referring to my annotations on your chart below. Enter 1 lot (“trade #1”) short at point #1. Protective stop is at magenta line (added by me, and supposed to be 10 pips above swing point, but not necessarily drawn to scale). When red line forms on bar after open, it is nearer to price action than the magenta line, hence the red line now takes over as the definitive stop (shown by my drawing magenta line to meet red line). At point #2, price has retraced to the 61.8 line, hence enter 1 lot (“trade #2”). Price obviously doesn’t quite reach red line at point #3. If it had done, then both positions would have been stopped out, and we would enter 1 lot long on the phase change. Because the red line formed below the 38.2 line, trades #3 and #4 can never be taken. At point #4, price reaches 100.0, hence trade #2 is closed out at a profit. Once price reaches the 161.8 line (point #5), no more trades may be added, even if price subsequently retraces back to 61.8 again (the “BAT range trade” scenario in the PDF). When price hits the red line at point #6, trade #1 is closed out (at a profit – nice!), and the change of phase means that we now enter 1 lot long, with new protective stop at swing low, and the process repeats itself. My understanding is that the initial stop (represented by the magenta line), and then the trailing red/blue line act as a full and final stop for all trades entered thus far during the current phase. Once the red/blue line moves "inside" the 38.2 and 61.8 fibo lines, additional trades can not be taken, because when price hits this line, all trades are closed, a new phase is begun and we start entering trades in the opposite direction. That is my understanding; I leave it to TA to confirm . Many thanks TA for sharing this novel method. A very interesting approach: an easy-to-follow, tightly-defined system that can potentially profit in both trending and ranging markets has definitely caught my attention! David

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Team Aphid, is there a reason why you don't use the 50% fib retrace as well?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
According to the .pdf description, single lot trades are closed at the break of the next colored BAT bar. In this example, some good profits would be given back on the LONG trade thru the break of the Red BAT bar. Is this simply part of this strategy or am I misinterpreting? thanks, Randy

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Team Aphid, instead of placing a stop loss to exit Entry Trade #1 at the red line (...or blue...), can you instead place a C.A.R. order? Will it have the same effect as stop one order, and enter one new order?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I do not want to speak for them, but there is no 50% Fib. Fibonacci never spoke of the factor 0.5 and this figure is as well not derivable of his system. I nevertheless agree with you that a 50% retracement is not uncommon. I am though curious why they "ignore" the fibonacci factor 0.236/1.236.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
TA asked for feedback. Here are my initial thoughts. These are very general in their nature; I haven't done any testing. I like BAT’s simplicity and precisely defined nature, as it allows for objective usage and automated testing. IMHO the basic premise is very sound, in that (with trade #1) one is entering a newly emerging trend, while trades #2-4 seek to exploit early retracements in this trend, via secondary entries at a more favorable price. Re timing of entry, some systems seek to enter earlier (for a long position), as a pullback in the prevailing trend is falling back, or has fallen back, into an “oversold” area of prior support, thereby anticipating the bounce, while others enter later , giving the newly emerging move more time to validate itself. I would suggest that BAT’s trade #1 fits the latter category, and is therefore well-suited to a trending market. Trades #2-4 also act as a kind of hedge, taking profit if the best the market manages to achieve is movement back to the starting point (100.0 line). This is perhaps significant, because these are the only profit-taking points, and any trailing stop method (on trade #1 in BAT’s case) always forfeits profit while waiting for the final retracement to hit the stop. Given that BAT has no explicit “move stoploss to breakeven” rule (not necessarily a bad thing, IMHO some traders do this too prematurely), one must come to terms psychologically with the fact that a trailing stop system occasionally allows a profit to erode itself into a loss (see RandyG67’s post). For better or worse, with BAT one is constantly “in the market”, as the trailing stop for the current phase simultaneously heralds the entry, in the opposite direction, into the next phase. There is no definition of indeterminacy, nor is there a longer term trend indicator that restricts trading against the prevailing trend. As I see it, one unnecessarily risky scenario is where the trailing stop (BAT line) lies just outside the 61.8 and (especially) the 38.2 lines, where new trades are being entered, as a small amount of volatility will cause these trades to be stopped out, before they have a chance to blossom. Perhaps the system could benefit from a variation along the lines of trades #2-4 only being entered after price, having retraced to the appropriate Fibo level, has subsequently moved X pips clear of the BAT line. Re volatility, the H1 chart is sufficiently short time frame to be buffeted by news announcements, and the spread costs are relatively higher to profit potential, compared with longer time frames (H4, D1, etc). I note that TA allows a second lot to be opened initially (potentially making 5 trades). Extending this idea, I would suggest that in a “trending” market, it is preferable to weight the initial trade, by adding lot(s) at this point, since, the stronger the trend, (1) the less likely deep early retracements are to occur, and (2) in a strongly trending market, one wants to have as many lots on as possible (some traders even go as far as pyramiding), because this is where the longest moves, and hence high-pip profits, are most likely to eventuate. Conversely, in a “ranging” market (in an H1 context), I would look to weight trades #2-4 more heavily, because trade #1 becomes a more risky proposition, in that (as a later type entry – see my earlier comment) it is more likely to lie nearer to the “wrong” extreme of the range. Of course all of this presupposes that we’re somehow able to anticipate when the market is going to move in and out of trending and ranging phases, which is not necessarily an easy task! The other key variable that could be experimented with is the “Factor”, but in attempting to optimize this, one must consider the caveats involved with “curve fitting”. (I note that the Factor does not have be an integer value.) Anyway, for whatever it’s worth, increasing the Factor allows a wider trailing stop, giving the trades more initial breathing space, but the drawbacks being that (1) losses will be greater, in a losing situation; (2) more profit is being forfeited when the BAT line finally gets hit, in a winning situation, and (3) this also means that the subsequent trade, on the phase change, is entered later (i.e. on balance, at a less favorable entry price). Decreasing the Factor would achieve the converse of all this. Attempting to optimize any system invariably results in these types of compromise, i.e. one can’t have one’s cake and eat it too! Having not done any testing, the following is just a gut feel, but I might look to use a lower Factor value in a trending market, where one can arguably get away with setting tighter stops, and a higher Factor value in a ranging market, where positions stopped out prematurely have a higher probability of bouncing back. However, and again a gut feel, my preference would lie with re-weighting the entries, rather than tinkering with the Factor. RandyG67’s post underlines the possibility of taking some profit, perhaps a partial closure at the 161.8 line? Of course this would reduce overall profit when the market happens to subsequently trend in prolonged fashion; another delicate compromise as we are decreasing both potential risk and return. This also revisits the possibility of a lower Factor which would tighten the BAT line stop, locking in profit more quickly. Or even (but this would undermine the simplicity of the system) a twin-stoploss system, with half of the profit being saved by a “move secondary stop to breakeven” at some tactical point, and the other half allowed to “ride” on the BAT line. This is probably only of academic interest, but increasing the “ATRperiod” value means that a greater number of historical bars are being averaged, generally resulting in a smoother moving BAT line (but weighting its value less heavily on the most recent data). A couple of parting thoughts. One final addition would perhaps be some kind of longer term trend indicator, with the proviso that one trades only in the direction of this prevailing trend. And perhaps some special conditions involving the handling of potentially high-impact news announcements (but this would mean moving away from a mechanical, technically-based system). Hope this gives some ideas to ponder. Comments and criticism most welcome! David

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Team Aphid. thanks for this method. I think it has potential and I like the fact that it is different. It reminds me very much of all the old PSAR systems, but I like the way you integrate Fibs for SL/TP and averaging. I am nevertheless professional sceptic and so I am in the process of finalizing an EA for this system. It is intended to basically serve for backtesting and maybe limited fronttesting, to see how this system really behaves in ranging markets and with other currencies. Would you guys rather put me that EA in a different thread, so that a discussion of the EA does not interfere with the discussion over the system, or do you prefer, to keep it all together?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
TA I am a little confused by your chart describing the Bat Range Trade on page 8 of the pdf document. The pink arrows show the first 2 trades. You have the first pink arrow at the 61.8 line and the second at the 'Enter 1 lot' line. Shouldn't these pink arrows be reversed as the first trade should be at the 'Enter 1 lot'. I presume price must break thru the fib level and not just touch it otherwise the bar after the first aqua arrow would have been a trade at the 38.2 level. What constitutes a retrace? Does the price have to close inside the fib level and then break it for a valid retrace? Is the last bar on the chart a valid retrace and should there be a trade at the 61.8 level?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
nice work. I have similar thoughts and I hope that some testing will bring more light to it.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Greetings! Thanks for the kind words. OK i added the email option to the 3 alerts. They can be downloaded in the BAT resource directory: http://www.accrete.com/fx-bat/ !!! Danger Will Robinson !!! The last time i used the email alert and went to the market for spices for the evening meal i came back to find about 200+ emails.. ...cuz it will send an email out every time there is a tick inside the PipAlertRange... soooo, set it to 1 or 0 !!!! I think i had it set to 5 which means that as long as price is within 5 pips either side of the line it wll send an alert each tick. And since we are talking price action and not candle close for our entry triggers we need the "tick" feature and not candle close. Happy trading. : ) Thom _____________End Note_____________ And for the record : I grabbed more pips during last nite's London session incorporating the BAT-ATR indicator along side my typical L.O. TA setup on the GbpUsd pair than any other L.O. i have on record! I was utilizing the Linear Regression Channel drawn (a bullish channel today) from the day's open at GMT 00 and filtering out entries that did not line up with traditional LRC entry rules; I.E. a bullish bounce off the lower LRC support line placed on a 15m chart. Then i added my favorite trend-finder-MA for a 15m intraday chart... a 96ema acting as an additional entry (headfake) filter... I had three good entries using these filters last nite. My intention was to have additional reasons For Not Trading...so these to me are just safety filters, not get-in-quicker-filters. NOTE: this may clasify as a "Hybrid"... Pips Ahoy!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Perhaps someone will clarify the entry point for me - the bar (or candle) must actually make contact with the blue or red line (not pass through the point where the line used to be), is that correct? I'm just trying to do a little eyeball backtest and am seeing a lot of places where price just misses the line by an hour or two and makes me wonder... Also, is actual contact with the line necessary for exit as well? Thanks, Lou G To add an example, is the crossing of the LEVEL of the blue line on 2007-1-16 at 15:00 a failed short trade that is stopped out when price crosses the subsequent red line?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Max, and everybody else, please criticise the system so that we can improve. Yes we said Trade # 1 can be traded with 2 lots, because our tests and live trades show that if you only BUY/SELL by using BAT lines (without using Trade # 2,3,4), system is still profitable. And at this stage, we prefer not to comment on risk/reward ratio, because we believe this issue is personal. Some people say winning ratio is more important, some say end-result is everything and some look at only drawdowns. There are many factors. You are also right that MM is an area that is open to improvement. But we believe it would be better if we can make it more mechanical again. If we say 2% or 3% risk, then again it totally depends how conservative or aggressive you are. And you are not bothering at all, every idea is important and we are seriously evaluating what everyone says here in FF. Thanks for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
You are welcome and thank you for your support.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Please see post #151. If you want to improve risk reward ratio for trades 2,3, and 4 you can try to enter these trades from 38.2 and 23.6 fib levels or 38.2 and swing high/low with a different SL level or change the number of lots. They are for range trading, therefore reward part is limited, unfortunately. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
It is quite possible that sometimes this will happen. Then, in your case, of course, you will not trade #3 and #4. We believe it does not indicate if it is a high/low probability trade, it totally depends on price ranges and momentum of previous bars.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Yes, because, when price hits BAT line, it may be an indication of a new trend. This is one of the most difficult part of trading, defining the trend. Therefore we prefer mechanical systems.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Actually, we haven't come across a case where 61.8 fib line is located outside the BAT lines, but it well may be the case for 38.2 fib line. This happens when your swing high/low point is too far away from your entry point. This means you are giving more room to the trade with higher stop loss, until BAT line appears. If you are not happy with your swing high\low point after BAT line appears and if you consider that the market will be sideways for a while, then you can change your swing point next hour depending on the position of BAT line.

Team Aphid, Thanks for your tremendous generosity in offering this system to us. in addition to the time and effort you are putting in answering posts. i really appreciate what you are doing here. Many thanks, Wiz.

OK, i'm treading lightly and humbly here. I'll delete this post if it is not appropriate (or it can be moved to a BAT-Mod thread?) though it appears in reading this thread several times that we are looking for ideas/refinements...so posted below i share the chart of my trades during the 17th's London Open. As you can see it is the dreaded 15m chart...! But it's become one of my favorite charts as i'm in front of my computer from 06:00 GMT to 10:00 GMT and then set chart alarms with a wake up call at 12:00 GMT and watch the charts for another 2 hours. This is not purely mechanical, but my goal is to find as many reasons NOT to trade as i can. So by having the Channels and the dialy moving average "Wave" as filters i can hopefully catch the trend of the London open and go with the flow. Remember, my style is to get in and out as i'm still not comfortable leaving trades unattended. The BAT ATR is adding a measure of confidence that i hadn't had before. So if nothing else TeamAphid's thoughts shared in this thread have increased this trader's level of confidence in his personalized style. . . And That Is A Good Thing . . . even if what i'm sharing is now considered a "Hybrid". (Scott, your post is great and i agree 100% with your statement!) OK, so here is the chart. I took long entries at each green circle and got out when the top of the channel was hit. Yes these are three seperate trades. The average hight of the channel was about 30 pips and these trades were worth about 20 to 25 pips each (21 to 27 to be exact). I could have just let this ride and not had the additional spread costs, but a pip in the bank is a good thing (of course this was in demo, but solid trades per my rules/style). These trades increased my demo account by just a smidge over 5% today. Please don't shoot the messenger... I'm just sharing what worked for me and how greatful i am for this additional "filter" in my arsenal...and in that spirit i share it w/U all : ) Cheers, Thom http://www.accrete.com/fx-bat/charts/20070117a.gif

Thank you Max. We agree that exit rule especially for trade #1 can be improved further and in fact it will improve the overall profitablity of BAT system. We tried many other methods for this, but then trade #1 loses its trend following ability. As we all know, trend following systems' stoploss levels are wider compared to other systems to give room to trends as there are big retracements within trends (we know people trading with 500 pips stoploss to catch the big moves and they are profitable). Check out the trade between Nov. 17th 2006 and Nov. 29th, 2006. It is quite possible to exit very early from this trade if you use some other exit methods and miss most of 533 pips trade #1 gained. We are aware that the proportion of total number of pips gained from trade #1 to maximum potential pips from entry is not that good and although we are trading this system live, we are still searching for a better exit method. That's why we need ideas and help of FF community. Regarding item #3.5, we believe the BAT system tells you what to do when trade is in development such as trailing trade #1 with BAT lines. Can you please explain more in detail what else you mean with this item. Thanks for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Your understanding is 100% correct and your chart can be used a template to explain the BAT system. Thank you.

Team Aphid , May I just join the cheers of thankyou for this very clean system as yet i have no questions other than why did you call it the Bat?. While studying and testing in the pf I had nicknamed it the special love indicator so taken with it i was, And now you have shared the mystery. I love the name . Please tell Best Wishes Swami S

Hi Fukinagashi, Thanks for taking an interest in this strategy. Even tho we do not use EA's we still have a healthy interest in them. Our chief programmer Zeus, has a dislike of coding them and therefore steers clear of them...( no amount of bribery can change his mind!) Therefore it would be great if you could do an EA. I think many others would also be interested. I think a seperate thread would be the way to go... that way a manual mechanical system will not get mixed up with an Auto mechanical system. Thanks again. Athena

--- 帖子 #163 ---
We used 61.8, because it is easy to reach and easy to swing between entry and 61.8 so that we can profit from multiple entries during sideway action. And we used 38.2, because 50 is too close to 61.8 and we wanted to improve risk reward ratio for range trading entries. You can use 23.6 and 0 levels as well depending on your risk profile. But we haven't tested them.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
The 'B' comes from Boris Schlossberg...we liked his idea of picking up trades in retracement and 'AT' comes from the ATR indi. 'Aphid' comes from the very first indi Zeus wrote...it was a little green dotty thing. Glad you are enjoying !!!

No, you are not misinterpreting, please see post #159. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
When we hold Trade #1, let's say long with 1 lot, we put limit order with two lots (short) to reverse the position, so 1 lot exits the long and the other one is the new Trade #1.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Please see post #163.

Thank you David for this feedback. We'll give answers and our thoughts within your text with blue fonts.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Yes, but you have to be careful with decimal points. If you see the value of a BAT line as 1.964640, then for short trade, you need to put your limit order to 1.9646, and for long trade, it is 1.9647. Naturally, same is true for exits (for trade #1 exits).

--- 帖子 #170 ---
It is absolutely appropriate and thanks for your kind words and contributions.

Hi Barcode Sorry you find this chart confusing but we were trying to point out the retracement trade pickup points not really the initial entry but I can see how this could confuse. The first bar after the first aqua arrow may well have picked up the trade but as we all know it might not have as well so for the purpose of clarity and visual reference the definite touch of the 38.2 level 5 bars later was used. The last bar of the chart is not a retracement as price had not returned to the initial entry level. A retracement re entry has to occur only after price has returned to the initial 'Enter 1 lot' line as it did 4/12 at approx 12.00 bar. We are tring to catch trades as they range before hopefully heading in our desired direction. Watching this type of trade and strategy in real time will help immensely. Hope this helps clear some confusion

Thanks TA, that cleared it up for me.

Hi Everyone, We are attaching backtest results for 2006 as promised. At the bottom, you will see winning ratio, total pips and pips from Trade #1. Winning ratio has been calculated out of three lots (we did count 38.2 fib level trade as 1 instead of 2, as they are the same trade). And we did not trade between Dec. 20th - Jan 2nd. As you can see, 11 months out of 12 are profitable and interestingly, most other systems we use also produced negative pips in August 2006. Some people believe most money managers are in holiday in London and NY in August, and this affects liquidity and volatility, so it is quite possible to see similar behaviours as in Christmas time. There is no spread taken into account in these results.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
just finished reading this thread and just about to start testing your sytem. One point I'd like to make so far is that within your system there seem to be some pretty spectacular drawdowns that aren't highlighted among your monthly figures I imagine you already know this but I'd like to draw your attention to two periods. May 4th - May 11th - drawdown = -842 pips Oct 31st - Nov 17th - drawdown = -920 pips.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
And you hit it on the money right there. Would you want to go through that, mentally? I wouldn't. That's a horrendous drawdown. That kind of drawdown, when I'm developing a system, is far from my acceptable limits.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
And some spectacular profits: June 14th - Jul 3rd -profit = +1112 pips Jul 14th - Jul 26th - profit = +906 pips Sep 12th - Oct 4th - profit = +779 pips We already know this drawdown issue, but it depends on how you look at the system and the risk profile of trader using it. We are not scalpers and most of the systems we use are medium to long term systems. Therefore, we are more interested in monthly figures. Thank you for highlighting this issue.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
1000 pips is great. But that's not the point. When it comes down to it, there are VERY few people that can handle a 900 pip drawdown. Heck, there are very few people that can handle 500 pips. So let's say that you're into this system -- three months down the road. And then all of a sudden, BAM, you hit a 900 pip drawdown. The first thing you think is, "Crap, I wonder if my system is now losing it's edge!" That's how people think. Furthermore, a 900 pip drawdown on a measly 1 standard lot is a whopping $9000. That's not a big deal if you have a 100K account. But 95% of all of the members on this forum are amatuers. The point is -- people can't handle that. If you want this to be successful, find a way to kill that drawdown, OR risk no more than 1% per trade, OR, don't trade this kind of system. Regardless, it is a good system. I actually like it and see myself using it for triggers to get in early on my longer trend setups.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Heres my spreadsheet on bat backtest. I include stoplosses in backtest to use MM for bat. Only backtest from december for now, I'll do further test later. From what I got, the Bat has around 8% max drawdown /w 1% risk on each trade. But its still vulnerable to whipsaw. Maybe add some rules about 'dont enter fibs signal unless it bounced from swing area/lower fibs area' ?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Please see post #176. We believe the ones who go through that, mentally, gain big pips. Trading psychology is the most difficult part in trading. Most portfolio managers or money managers are evaluated with respect to their annual performances, not even monthly. We are not saying drawdown is not an important issue and we believe a smooth and consistent yield curve is better and preferable than the one with big zigzags. But, unfortunately, we are having this kind of drawdowns occasionally and this is the nature of trend following systems as they use larger stoploss levels compared to other systems.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I'm sorry to sound harsh. I will go back and edit some of my post. But I really want to see you guys do well, and I just know not that many people will be able to handle that. I am a trend follower. I know what kind of drawdowns you can get... and it's hard. If you're going to use this system, don't risk much.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thank you for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Clearly profitability overall is more important, and overall the system seems to work well. It's just that this system is supposedly able to gain pips in both trending and ranging markets. I might be misunderstanding, but surely when testing and attempting to improve a system its greatest weaknesses are the best place to start. Whether these weaknesses appear over a single week , month or aeon is somewhat irrelevant. The greatest observable weakness of this system is that it lost 920 pips in a fortnight. This seems to me to imply room for improvement and a cluee as to where to look.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
We agree with you, and therefore we are here altogether to improve it. We are not selling and we have no worries to be successful. We are just sharing and trying to get new ideas from valuable members of FF. We'd also like to add that if these drawdowns occur frequently, then this means there is a weakness there. But if such drawdowns occur rarely, then there is always a risk of damaging some other parts of the system while trying to improve drawdowns. But, we are open to any suggestion to improve BAT system. Thank you.

Firstly...do not risk anything until you have familiarised yourself on a demo account with the nuances of this strategy. Secondly....risk and it's management will be what will define your success with any system!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Great observations here. Let's not forget the purpose of this thread is to improve the BAT method for the methods sake; not to improve the BAT method to make up for shortfalls in a trader's psychology. It is a sad fact that many traders bail out of a method because of a large drawdown, right before the method corrects and delivers a very large series of gains. Confidence is achieved on an individual basis by each trader. And it is individually that each trader must take a method of interest and personally backtest and forward test it themselves and not rely on backtests done by someone else. Even assuming another persons backtest is an accurate reflection of the method itself, it does a trader no good unless they perform an additional backtest &amp; forward test of their own in order to allow the method to get into their heart and soul, and take root and grow the tree whose fruit is personal confidence in the method. And I am talking about manual backtesting here, vis a bar, mano a baro. Automated backtesting is fine for stats, but it wont plant the seeds of confidence into a trader. And it is this self earned confidence that will be the shield against the occasional large drawdown. BTW, ain't TA somethin'? I know Athena well, and she is as lovely as she is witty and intelligent! (Okay Athena, you can break out the blushing emoticon now! LOL! ) Dial (butting back out for the second time)

Hi Mr. Trend, I like it that you play the devils advocat here. You are perfectly right 900 pips down is painful, and no one can guarantee that they don't happen right at the beginning. But is not thought through. When you trade this system and apply plain vanilla money management, you would risk 1000$ Lots only if you would have 100k (4 lotunits per setup, lets take 4% risk per setup to keep it simple = 1% risk per lotunit) Thus if you have only 1000 $, you would risk 10 $ per trade , thus you would loose only 90 $. That is 9% of your capital, and you will still end up with 170% (52% compounded) at the end of the year. And I guarantee you that = For a mechanical system THAT is almost phenomenal (assuming the backtesting is correct). What I nevertheless very much like about your point, is that it clarifies one thing: EVERYONE WHO PUTS THIS SYSTEM ON HIS REAL MONEY DOES ABSOLUTLY NEED TO APPLY SANE MONEYMANGEMENT!!!

Hi TA! Hi FF Members! Thanks for your feedback! 1.Heh… It’s so hard to recoding MQL code to Easy code. I can’t understand – why people use MT??? It’s free, I know. But awful interface, idiotically tester….it’s awful! J Only IMHO (I’m sorry to your chief programmer J ) 2.I’ve started to do automatic backtesting and you are right – your system is profitable with 1 lot. But I have a lot ideas: 2.1. You told that we take off all orders if price crosses 161,8 i think we must move our SL on breakeven. And if The BAT line crosses enter point we move or stop on the BAT. It’s because sometimes we have long time range market with high volatility and our The bat line stay below enter point but we can get Profit but get Loss 2.2.When we have longtime up or down trend we should to change The BAT parameters and move the line as close as possible. It can help us to close profit. But our Trade1 we must do on standard rules. My English is bad and because I advise to read about this technique by Lebou 2.3 We should make analysis the MFE of this system and it can help it to get new ideas about exits. It’s only 3 ideas after first backtest by Omega TS 3.About my #3.5. It’s correlation with #2.2. I put it because here is correct English J Regulating the position size on the basis of its risk and volatility. The risk of an open position is usually controlled by exit rules set in the system. For instance, moving stop levels follow the price to increase starting risk or lock down a part of paper profits. But a much more viable idea is to limit the maximal risk and volatility of an open position in relation to the capital. All we need for this is track the values as often as needed. Excessive_risk = Num_lots * Current_risk_per_unit_of_assets – Max%risk * Capital / 100 and Excessive_volatility = Num_lots * Current_volatility_of_assets – Max%volatility * Capital / 100. As soon as any of those becomes positive, we decrease the position size by a value equal to: Excessive_num_lots = Excessive_risk / Lot_price Or correspondingly by: Excessive_number_lots = Excessive volatility / Lot_price The practical rationale of this methods is closing a part of the position without waiting for the system signal, when the prices move very fast and far, too far and fast for a trailing stop or a closing point to follow. This solves two tasks at once: first, the risk and volatility are supported at set levels, second, positions frequently close at extreme prices with favourable slippage. If my English leads astray – I’m sorry

This system is a good trend following system, but it kills when trend turns 180 degrees, so how do we negate this? These are my shumble suggestions, i am not here to change anything if i do or am actually changing the system schematics i duly apologise. Here goes. Usually cycle of a trend is: up---consolidate---down I will suggest these two steps: Trend Identification+Confirmation I would highly recommend the use of a long term MA those who trades the hourly bar would proly wanna look at 3 day trend which would be the 72EMA. wherever the price belies on the MA could help confirming the trend. Rule for trades when bat signals long trade : - Make sure price is above the 72EMA vise versa for a downtrend Once Trend is noted, Keep tabs of "Winner Trades" that goes against the trend. Note that you could get winners when trading against the trend. It is not wrong but its not advisable esp with this system, your drawdown could be huge. Note the trend and if a short trade becomes a winner in an uptrending market whilst failing to secure a higher high is a signal that trend is changing... - the agrresive trader can start waiting for short bat signal, ignore all longs signals unless it becomes a winner. - the passive should wait for one confirmation of a winner trade before coming in for the second round. *I declare a trade as a winner when price hits 161 retracement mark. On Money Management and Price action on fib lines We proly will need to sit down and relook this. Infact if we could somehow reduce the risk exposure for the average trader. All my suggestions above could all together be negated. What i have added is basically a filter which will reduce trade signals. regards, jest

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Off the BAT topic, but in response to posts #175 thru #184........ Generally speaking, most systems are designed to perform in either a trending, or a ranging, market. Systems incur drawdowns when market conditions become discordant with the signals that are being generated. It is impossible to design a system that is capable of anticipating every possible set of market conditions that is likely to occur, and then adjust itself accordingly to suit. If market conditions remain unfavorable for a long enough period, then large drawdowns are the inevitable result, with any system. That is a reality that all traders must somehow come to terms with. The only way of (mathematically) increasing return is to increase risk commensurately. This not only applies to position sizing, where the proportional effect of scaling is obvious, but also to the entry/exit method. For example, if one chooses to take profit early, then that is eliminating the risk of losing that profit, but along with it the opportunity for future return on that trade. As another example, if one enters earlier, that will generally result in a higher return-to-risk profile, but a lower overall win rate. Likewise with tighter protective stops. Every trading system involves these kind of underlying compromises, whether the developer (or trader) is aware of it or not. Every trader searches endlessly for the ultimate method. It’s probably fair to say that some entry/exit methods are superior to others, but generally only under certain types of market conditions, and – in any case – one can only state this quantitatively in so far as testing delivers the necessary statistical confidence. Unlike casino-type games of chance, the markets are driven by sentiment-based response to economic forces; such intangibles mean that probabilities can’t be calculated with any degree of certainty. In other words, no matter how positive the back-testing result, there is no guarantee that the immediate future will provide a similar ‘climate’ to that which was used for the testing. Selecting a suitably sized data sample is not a trivial task: too small jeopardizes statistical validity, and too large runs the risk of losing accurate representation through obsolescence. Many traders baulk at the possibility of a 900 pip drawdown, but the reality is that (for most of us) a $90 loss is tolerable; a $90,000 loss is not. The problem is that human nature wants to obtain the $540,000, rather than $540, each year, without having to stomach the commensurate level of risk. When I began studying trading systems about 5 years ago, I assumed that the ‘Holy Grail’ would be a method that maximized return while minimizing risk. However, I have slowly grown to realize that to increase return one has to in some way increase risk, and that the ultimate system is one that balances return, drawdown and consistency of income, in a way that rests comfortably with a trader's temperament, financial objectives, and lifestyle schedule. This is a harsh judgment, but those who are unable to accept this balance, and/or cope with the uncertainties innate in trading, should seriously reconsider their decision to be a trader. Trading is not for everybody. David

any idea about total results for the system in 2005?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Without trying to be offensive. I really think the best answer is to grab a chart and spreadsheet and manually backtest it for yourself. I know this is time consuming but I also know that's it's worth a lot more than just reading someone elses results. Wiz.

i agree ...but why spending time doing it if information is already available in soembody else computer....

--- 帖子 #200 ---
So you have confidence in it yourself...

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Jip, agree there with Wiz. When doing a manual backtest it prepares you much better to handle the real serious drawdowns. You get a feel for the system, you get FAITH in the system. When you trade the system live it's much easier to handle these situations. By using an EA we do not get the same feeling for the system, therefore DOUBT takes over. With that I do not say to not use EA's, feel free if you are more comfortable with it. Just sit down and think for a moment what it will do to your mental make-up when you are trading on the hard right edge of the chart, all on your own with real money. The following is from a book by John Hayden - "The 21 Irrefutable Truths Of Trading": Comparison Table Of Virtues versus Vices Faith attacks Doubt Confidence attacks Fear Discipline attacks Indecision Courage attacks Anger Intuition builds Insight Persistance build Accomplishments Flexibility builds Growth Integrity demands Virtues More in that table than in some trading books. Pretty much sums up the view Team Aphid have on trading as well. Thanks for all the support and feedback, really appreciate it. Zeus

--- 帖子 #202 ---
A big thanks to Team Aphid, i do have some ideas which i will test. This system is very much like a system i have been developing for the GBPSUD futures over the last couple of months. Both systems work on the principle of breaking a trailing ATR for entry. I have some ideas which i have found to improve my system, i will test these to see if they further improve the expectancy of the BAT. I'll report back in a few days http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif Cheers Charlie

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Also.. do your results include the spread? I am thinking if some form of filter might cut the number of trades while resulting in only slightly leaner results. Perhaps the use of the ATR indicator on a daily or weekly chart as well, therefore we would only take a long trade is it was in agreement with longer timeframe ATR. I have tested this filter on my futures system and it really made little differnce, but i beleive this is in part because my futures system is working off 2 min charts(filter 240 mins)!! Perhaps it might have more value to your 1 hr BAT system. I'll get testing my other ideas......... Cheers Charlie

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Thanks to TeamAphid for sharing this system. Looks promising once we can reduce the drawdowns.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
ed The drawdowns look reasonable to me, i'd be happy to trade this system now........... I have looked at how a daily ATR filter may increase the expectancy of the system. Sadly just as with my futures system it makes no difference. Obviously it cuts the trades but almost cuts the profits in a proportional manner... Still have other ideas which i am confident will increase the profitability........... Cheers Charlie

Did anyone go short this morning at 9679?

Short @ 9671, added 1 part @ 9713 and 2 @ 9738. Waiting for either a full monty or a stop. BTW I am basing my position size on the original BAT entry to original stop. Then divide by 4. So my risk will always be less than 2%.

Thanks, It's nice to see I am in the right ballpark. I notice the top bat line is starting to move down so when the hour closes I'll move my stop lower.

The BAT is mechanical...very hard to account for emotion in backtesting. In real time an undisciplined trader will have a certain bias towards price being bullish or bearish and if they allow this to overide their entry signal into a BAT trade ( just an example but any mechanical system) they are possibly setting themselves up for disappointment.

This is one way to limit your risk and we do the same. If our risk profile allows us to trade 1 standard lot, then we trade 1 lot but divide it into 4, so each lot becomes 25000 unit. Thanks for pointing out this issue, Wiz.

Please see post #173.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
i have not read this whole thread but i took a look at the document. correct me if i am wrong but this seems like a breakout trading method, based on the ATR, right? so it has the same basic underlying method as say...a moving average crossover but instead of a set moving average, you use the ATR as a guage for signaling when a trend changes/begins?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thank you in advance for your contributions. No, our results do not include the spread. Therefore, we enter the trade with 2 lots (Trade #1) and it compensates spreads and give us some extra pips. We are working on filters as well and still testing jest1081's 72 EMA idea (please see post #190). So far, it seems it helps some of the losing trades if there is a STRONG trend and BAT triggers a countertrend signal (check out elimination of countertrend trades between Oct. 27th and Nov 3rd). But, on the other hand, it should be used with care in ranging markets and turning points due to its lagging nature. Still work in progress.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I went in at 1.9694. That's not a typo...I was trading my BATmod on the 15 minute chart for trading the BAT strategy in an intraday mode. As shown in the image below I entered with full lots at the bear break of the BAT line at 1.9694. I took 1/3 profits at the 1.236 Fibo (~20pips banked) south of the entry, and another 1/3 profits at the 1.5 Fibo south of entry (~40 pips banked) and let the last 1/3 ride but moved stop to BE+1 so i was stopped out in profit on the final third on the retracement. In this shot below look how pip-on the price hit those 1.236, 1.5 and 1.618 fibos...FREAKY accurate this trade. Jest had mentioned he considers a trade completed when the 1.161.8 fibo is reached. This was text book perfect for what he mentioned in his earlier post! Had i just taken profits at that last fibo the final 1/3rd lots would have been ~60pips : ) http://www.twotrilliondollarsdaily.c...070118a15m.gif

Yes, it is basically a breakout technique, but it has some additions such as trying to profit in ranging markets by using fib leves. It is similar to a moving average crossover system in a sense (sell if price is under blue line and vice versa), but ATR gives more room to trades, so it handles many situations better than MAs, IMHO.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
We tested 161.8 exit for trade #1 and it gave us less pips compared to our existing "leaving it to BAT line" strategy. But, of course, this is the case for 1hr timeframe. Since you are using 15 minute chart, you may get different results. We believe it is worth testing the idea of exiting part of the trade #1 at a certaian level and leaving the remaining part to BAT line for trailing. It may well improve the end result. Thanks again for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Great system.... I've integrated it with my current system and use it for entry if all lines up with my analysis. A quick question... Where is the Fib drawing indicator made availale with the labels of where to enter multiple positions. I cant find it. Can someone please post it or direct me to it? Thanks, Bago

--- 帖子 #229 ---
LOL. why dont you guys/gals unmask? its killing me but i understand. team aphid has been here since forex factory was still in the crib. i can say that cant i? old old friends they be.

I tried following the rules, but sleep got in the way, which I think will compromise everyone's ability to follow it 100% (unless I'm having a blonde moment with order options??...please let me know!). I set a Stop sell for trade 1 @ 1.9671 (filled) with a contingent stop buy @ 1.9779+10+3spread=1.9793. Upon waking, trade#1(above) was filled but I missed trades 2,3,4 because I don't think you can set your orders for #2,3,4 until #1 is filled (PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong). So I just added 2 positions (for trades 3&amp;4) at the current price, 1.9746, slightly above the 38% fib. So I now have trades 1,3,4 but no #2 trade. Wiz, I agree with the divide by 4 position size method. I went thru the back test results of TA and the average loss was 42pips, so, on average (based on the 2006 backtests) you could possibly base your total risk on 4x42pips per setup. For interest sake, other 2006 backtest figures based on TA's spreadsheet are: Av loss 42pips (213 losing trades) Av win 61pips (234 winning trades, 1 breakeven) Av outcome is 11.95 pips per trade Expectancy 11.95/42=0.28 (I think this is one way to do it?) Cheers John

The Fibo levels are mentioned in the PDF file located in post 35 and then there is a simple mod on the levels if you also wish to have the price show on the fibo line that i posted in post 69 . Have fun, great suff TeamAphid has here Bago! Thom

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Bago, It hasn't been provided. Just use the standard MT4 fib retracement tool as described on page #1 of the pdf. Also, if you want the prices displayed at the various levels, you can just type @%$ in the Description column. For example, for Level 0.382, you could type the following in the Description column: 38.2 enter 1lot@%$ so that "38.2 enter [color=black]1lot@1.9713[/color]" will be displayed on your fib line on the chart. Cheers, John

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Thanks John, for your figures on 2006 backtest results. Please see our responses, where necessary, within your text.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Great! Thanks for the help guys! B.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thanks TeamAphid for your efforts. Am I interpreting this correctly? Your 2006 spreadsheet backtest results DON'T include spread costs. So as there were 448 trade positions taken for the year, the spread costs would be 448*4=1792 (assuming 4 pip spread for GBPUSD). Therefore the net trade profit for the year would be reduced to 5356-1792=3564. If so, it reduces the Av outcome to 7.96pips per trade and the Av loss increases to 45pips per trade, so the expectancy (av pip return per pip risked) reduces to 7.96/45=0.18. Thanks, John

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I think Team Aphid has put a very simple yet effective system all together. Congratulations and many thanks for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Yes, you are interpreting correctly, though our spread is 3 pips. That's why we initiate the trade #1 with two lots to improve end results and statistics, and it helped a lot since trade #1 itself is already profitable (+3372 pips profit vs. (448 * 3) -1344 pips for spread). So end result for us is 5356 + 3372 - 1344 = +7384 pips including spread. And this improves statistical figures.

--- 帖子 #238 ---

--- 帖子 #240 ---
When you are setting buy stops/limits i assume you add spread. So we are not entering the levels we have on the chart but rather 4 pips (in my case) higher. i forgot to do this when i backtested and it results in a lot of errors because the charts are bid. Doh!!! So that means on those trades that looked like they missed the stop by a few pips actually would have been taken out in real life if we had used the bid price for our orders. So for current GBP/USD the exit showing on the chart is 9783, so my stop really needs to be set at 9787 otherwise I'll be stopped out too early, which might save a few pips here and there but I think will result in missing many orders. Am I right? Wiz.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
it appears that a more sure sign is waiting for the hour to CLOSE above/below the red/blue bat line before buying/selling. this eliminates some false signals. it is not a home run, but it appears that although this will eliminate some profits, it will preserve more capital. additionally, it appears that if at buy#1, instead of adding 2+ pips, double that with a limit for 1/2 at 10 pips gained. this will help hedge against the other 1/2 incase the run is short lived.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Wow. Newstrading is one minute of insanity separated by nauseating hours of ______________ . Now thanks to you guys and gal(s), I have another new toy to absorb those nauseating hours of ......whatever. And just when I thought the amazing range of intellectual generosity continually evidenced on FF had peaked at the highest fib level....you guys and gal(s) at Team Aphid roll this baby out!! I just read the entire thread and what a page turner; better than some novels on the NY Times Bestseller list!!! My personal thanks and kudos for you, added to those who preceded me and to the gratitude of those who will most surely follow.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
yes, your stop and new limit buy order should be set at 9787 since mt4 shows bid prices. Otherwise you'll exit early (if you set your order at 9783). This is true to enter LONG trades, but you can use whatever the BAT indicator and fib levels show you on chart for SHORT trades.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Thank you for your nice words, compliments and support.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
This should be tested properly to see how many pips you sacrifice and how many pips you save. And it will change many trade #2,3,4 entries as well. Please have a look at Oct 2nd, 2006 15:00hr bar. If you wait for the hour to close, you are missing almost all potential profit (158 pips potential profit for 2 lots entry for trade #1, you get only 26 pips for 2 lots, instead). (example to "sacrifice") So, the idea should be tested and then compared with original test results. Thank you for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Just a quick status report on the EA. The biggest bugs are out. I had a few short backtests last night, and they were very promising. I am running now while I am at work a backtest for 2006 to be able to compare with the manual backtest and thus see if the overall logic is really like forseen. My first impression: Entries: They are just great. All have the potential for 23.6% to 261.8%. Don't filter them, don't wait for full candles, you will rather loose good trades, without improving the success. Maintainance of trades: I was/am very sceptical to invest into a "bad" trade, but the idea of averaging the price by buying new lotunits at -62% and -38% retracements seem to be it, often the trades turn and with nice results. Exit: I see here the greatest potential for improvements. Often, when a price goes to +61.8 it will go beyond. I need to think something up. As well: Many trades which go wrong, still go first up to 23.6% and even to 50%, before going south. Backtesting of new exits will proove how to deal with that.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Thank you fukinagashi, your observations are correct and we share your ideas especially the one about greatest potential for improvements of exits which will also improve the end result substantially, though it may not improve winning ratio. As TeamAphid, we believe we leave too many potential pips on table. Because we know there are many pros trading mechanical systems between 40-50% winning ratios and perform well. As BAT system is designed to perform both in trending and ranging markets, its winning ratio is quite reasonable. Therefore, instead of focusing elimination of losing trades (if one can do that without harming the potential winning trades, that's fine), we believe we need to focus grabing more pips from winning trades by improving exits.

Thanks for the great system. I'm testing it now. Apologies for the 'newbie' question but I'm sure others have been caught by it. I placed a 'BuySTOP' for the initial order, the price fell and hit my next order. It was a 'BuyLIMIT' which seemed to cancel out the first order which I'm pretty sure isn't meant to happen I tried to place a 'BuySTOP' at this level (and the next one) but FXDD system wouldn't let me. Can some kind soul please tell me what type of order I'm supposed to place as a pending order? Regards Lux

--- 帖子 #251 ---
All you need to use Limit Order for entries. But, please do not put limit orders for trade #2,3,4 before limit order for trade #1 is filled.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
When trading the "open with 2 lots variation", does that mean that a full monty is now potentially 5 lots, or still 4 with only a single lot open for trade #3?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thanks for the response TA. That's exactly what I did. The initial order was running and the other two where set as pending 'BuyLIMIT's but for some reason when the second order was triggered it canceled the first order. Lux

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Just a thought but your broker may combine the orders so it will only show as one order but you just added to it.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Yes, a full monty is now potentially 5 lots; 2 lots for trade #1 1 lot for trade #2 61.8 fib level 2 lots for trade #3,4 38.2 fib level

--- 帖子 #256 ---
TeamAphid, Thank you for great strategy! I was wondering if it would be possible to create EA which would modify stop loss when TA line changes and send alert when TA was hit. It would make it easier to track positions. P.S. I can try to create this EA, but I’m not very proficient with mql4.. Thanks! Den

--- 帖子 #257 ---
When you enter with "2 lots (Trade #1) and it compensates spreads and give us some extra pips", do you consider them as one and let them both run? Do you close one lot to lock in profit at some point? For example 161.8 Fib.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
No it appears the first order was canceled (minus 45 pips) when the second order was triggered. I'm going to have to figure this out if I'm to use this system. Lux

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Please see post #246. fukinagashi, can you please look into this if it would be possible to add this feature? Thanks.

Try using Heikin Ashi candles for your exits... see if that helps.

I too am trying to put an EA together for the Bat. My sticky point right now is setting a variable equal to the blue and red lines. Sorry cutting and pasting the Bat indicator doesn't look like it will work. Can somebody give me a clear definition as to what exactly the blue and red lines represent and how I might go about calculating them in a real time basis? Looking at the code this is probably a harder question than it looks.

Hi Everyone, We are attaching backtest results of GBPJPY, another currency we are trading live with BAT. We are again using "2 lots for trade #1" version to cover 6 pips spread, so end result becomes; +4873 + 3246 - (308 * 6) = 6,271 pips in 2006. So, total of 13,649 pips (7,378 pips for GBPUSD (5 lots version) and 6,271 pips for GBPJPY) in 2006 by trading the BAT.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Are the indicator settings 5 and 4 as with the GRP?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi again, This isn't a major improvement that you are looking for, but it will improve the system nonetheless. here is the current system: 2 lots for trade #1 1 lot for trade #2 61.8 fib level 2 lots for trade #3,4 38.2 fib level Here is my suggestion: 3 lots for trade #1 1 lot for trade #2 61.8 fib level 2 lots for trade #3,4 38.2 fib level 1 of the 3 lots for trade #1 should be limited to 7-8 pips. This will help hedge against short runs that never allow for any profit. I have eyed the last six months and it appears that this will increase the monthly profit.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Yup, that works. Thanks Lux

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Yes, we use the same settings as with the GBPUSD.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
There are a few alternatives to choose from. Your suggestion is also valid, so anyone can modify the number of lots traded or profit taking level for trade #1 depending on risk profile. Thank you for your suggestion.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Team Aphid Is the system document still standing as originally posted or have there been any official changes to it as a result of the discussions in this thread which have been substantiated by your tests?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Yes, the system document is in original form and there is no official changes. We only made a variation (trading 2 lots for trade #1), but we explained this option during discussions, but did not add this to original document as it totally depends on risk profile of traders.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Please check out current GBPJPY trade. Long position taken on Jan 11th, 2007 @ 231.70 and still holding. Current Stop level is @ 239.16 with 746 pips profit and still trailing. That's what trend trading is all about.

well out of the short trade now, going long now but can anyone tell me where to put the swing line. 1.9690 or 1.9635? thanks

or 1.9715, Which is more important 'Recent' or 'Significant'?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Thank you Team Aphid I would like to know the formula of BAT ATR indicator..An explanation, so I can translate it for other softwares that I use. Thanks again Canados

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I have my swing low at 1.9693 which is the lowest low following the previous swing high.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I have mine at 1.9635. BTW, in my backtesting of this strategy, 2005 was pretty poor while '04 and '06 were pretty decent. Here are my results: 2004: 5818 pips 2005: 1100 pips 2006: 5355 pips 2007: 1239 pips edit: This is with the "5 lot version" also. Dunno where TA got that extra 2000 pips in '06...

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Yes, we have tested it on EURUSD and other currencies as well. We are trading more profitable systems on EURUSD and other currencies, but according to our test results, you can backtest USDCHF, USDCAD and EURAUD (this is another currency we trade live with BAT, it has similar test results as in GBPJPY with a better winning ratio) as they are more profitable compared to others.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
We have informed our programmer regarding your request. But if you know meta language, you can find it out by clicking on "Modify" and entering MetaEditor. Thank you.

TA Don't understand your trade here. Shouldn't that trade have been closed out on the 19th at about 239.13 when the price broke thru the ATR? http://www.pixhost.eu/share/2007-01-23/gbpjpy.gif

--- 帖子 #285 ---
TeamAphid, Are there general recommendation for choosing recent swing high/low? For example for current long signal someone would pick 1.9714 or 1.9691 or 1.9635 which could affect results greatly. Thanks! Den

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Barcode, Are you using Alpari server? You may get a different result with a different server. Our tests and results are based on Alpari server and the chart below shows that the GBPJPY trade is still open.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
do we have a chance to learn one day the other systems that you are trading? Would be great....

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Our general recommendation is to choose a recent and significant high/low. It also depends on your risk profile. If you would like to give trade more room, then you can choose a significant lower low/higher high or vice versa. For the current trade, our swing low is @ 1.9715. By examining the test results, you can have a better idea about how we choose swing low/high.

We haven't decided yet, but when we do, Forex Factory will be the place.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
TA, how does EURAUD look? Also, have you backtested this on GBPCHF?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
We'll post test results for EURAUD later, but its winning ratio is around 57%. We haven't tested GBPCHF.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
As the bottom line moves up above the zero fib level at what point do you cancel the limit buy orders at the 38.2 and 61.8 levels? Is there a rule or recommended level or just common sense?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
In the pdf it said that the pending orders were cancelled once price hit the 161.8 level. Cheers

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thanks, But what if price has not hit the 161.8 level. My example would be GBPUSD at the moment. The original 61.8 trade opened and took profit already. I canceled the 38.2 trades because of the rising bottom line. I was wondering if there were rules concerning the 38.2 cancellation and a re-entry or cancellation of the limit buy at the 61.8 level.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
If price does not hit 161.8 level, then you can have multiple trades at 61.8 and 38.2 levels. For current GBPUSD trade, for example, the price did not hit 161.8 level, therefore put another limit buy order at 61.8 fib level. 38.2 level is too close to blue BAT line, so you can cancel that trade. If price hits 161.8 level, then you need to cancel 61.8 and 38.2 trades. This is rule no.1 for cancellations. And if, let's say blue BAT line rises above 38.2 level, then you will cancel 38.2 trade and if blue BAT line rises above 61.8 level, then you will cancel 61.8 trade, too, as blue BAT line is the trigger level for short trade. This is rule no.2 for cancellations.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Barcode, Are your settings right? My chart shows a long blue bat line from the 11th of jan.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hey Oz...you looking at the H4 or H1 chart? It's supposed to be H1 according to the pdf. Lux

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Barcode, Your settings on the BAT indicator need to be changed. ATR period to 5 and Factor to 4. Then you will have a blue BAT line from 11th Jan. Antra

--- 帖子 #299 ---
nvwine pm'd me and pointed me to the problem. I didn't change the indicator default figures. Now its identical to yours. Thanks to The Wiz, Antra and luxinterior for your help.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Team Aphid Could you comment on the above level as swing low, it has taken place before the recent swing high, is it valid?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Of course, it is valid but not a good one due to a couple of reasons. 1- It is too far away compared to entry level (1.9776). So, your stop loss for trade #1 will be 141 + 10 = 151 pips. If this is suitable to your risk profile, it is a valid swing low. 2- As you can see on the chart, the blue BAT line started to rise a few bars later and passes through 38.2 and 61.8 fib levels. By putting your swing low @ 1.9635, you give no chance to range trading. Therefore, 1.9715 is a better choice as a swing low.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Good point re: the fib levels... When doing my backtests, the "significant" highs/lows I spotted averaged around 100 pips away from the entry price. Perhaps my test results would have been better had I used smaller stops where possible.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
By my testing, BAT needs some serious volatility, or a big trend in order to be profitable (call me "captain obvious" ). IMO: Many of us are backtesting with GBP_USD '06 data (and feeling pretty froggy about the results). Reference a daily chart showing all of '06 and '05 together though and we can see why '06 is is so great and '05 is terrible. Put some bollingers on that daily chart and it's even more explanatory. In '05 the trend was nonexistent, the bollingers were getting narrower, and BAT was missing the ball. Perhaps there's a filter in there somewhere... I'm not complaining about the results so far. I think this method has a lot of potential, but just about any trend following strategy will make a pile of pips... when there's a trend. If we can make this strategy work well in the market conditions from about 7/05 - 3/06, then I think we're really on to something. Otherwise, I think there are other trend following strategies that leave a lot less on the table. Or maybe I'm still not testing the strategy correctly, but ranging conditions consistently kill my back test accounts.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
in my analysis, there are basically 3 ways of trading. trend following-works great in trends, but you lose it all during a range breakout trading-works when it does, fails when it doesnt. you make during successful breakouts but lose it when false breakouts occur. top and bottom picking-great during a range, but horrible during trends. these all work maybe 1/3 of the time.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi all! Wgen you look at the The BAT you can see that the line looks like stairs. We can use it for add the position. Look at the screen. I think my idea is clear Max

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Entered short on EUR/USD today at 1.30...161.8 reached so there are not pending orders....I'm in with 1 lot..stop loss@1.3045 I really like this system...Sometimes the Bat lines are turning points so the price touches the line and turns back within a few bars...I'm thinking how limit losses when this happens...see the pic

who is testing this system?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I'm. why?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
hi guys.still dont understand the best exit strategy for trade #1.can any1 explain pls.'ll appreciate it so much.thx

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Documentation says you exit the trade when BAT line is hit. But, for example yesterday I missed over 100 pips from long trade using this approach. Perhaps it make sense to close 1st lot from 1st trade (assuming we have 2 lots in trade 1) for fixed profit target. Regards, Den

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Folks -- welcome to Trend Trading. You're not going to capture every pip. Leaving 100 pips is a bit much, but you can always develop your own exit techniques... or possibly scale out techniques. Interestingly enough, when I backtest scale outs into my systems, believe it or not, it really doesn't make much of a different to your bottom line, however, you get the benefit of reducing risk.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Just wanted to direct your intention to this thread. Please try to keep . as much as possible - the threads apart. The discussion of the method here, the discussion of issues of the EA there.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
AverageYuppy, I’ve reached exactly the same conclusion as you have, after 5 years of R&amp;D. Put suitably calibrated Bollinger bands on a chart: 1) When the market is ranging, prices bounce between the upper and lower bands, and one profits by fading these bounces. 2) When the market is trending, prices stay in the appropriate (upper or lower) half of the bands, and if trending strongly enough, push the bands significantly outward. In this climate, one profits by riding the trends. 3) When the bands constrict, prices will eventually break out, pushing the band outward, and clinging to the band. Breakouts frequently offer explosive, ‘clean’ price movement, at relatively low risk. But, exactly as you point out, there are plenty of false breakouts, and the breakout can peter out at any point. The problem is that it’s no easier to forecast which of the three scenarios is imminent, than it is to simply forecast whether price will rise or fall. All trading methods attempt to exploit one of these three scenarios, but very few are equipped to deal with more than one. One can try to combine (1) and (2), by trading in the direction of the next longer trend, but entering during a pullback. The assumption being that, in a ranging market, the pullback should be followed by a retracement to at least the mean, and in a trending market, the trend should continue. The BAT method attempts to accomplish this, albeit ‘in reverse’, by first entering on the assumption that a trend is establishing itself, and then hedging this somewhat by entering successive positions into a minor pullback. Whatever the method, it doesn’t really matter what technical indicators one uses, because the bottom line is that one enters on a price bar, and exits on a price bar, and just about any indicator can be calibrated suitably to enter as early or as late, in an emerging price movement, as one wishes. As general rules , every method involves an inversely proportional trade-off between the return-to-risk profile (R) and the win rate (W): Earlier entry into a price movement will attain greater profit if the trade succeeds (higher R), but will succeed less often (lower W); later, the reverse. Setting a tighter protective stop will result in smaller losses (higher R), but will result in more frequent stopouts (lower W). Exiting via targets locks in profit (higher W), and works better in ranging markets, but curtails profit (lowers R), if the price happens to trend. A trailing stop works oppositely, i.e. well in trending markets, poorly in ranging. The tighter the stop, the greater the risk of being stopped out prematurely in a trend (lower R, higher W), but the less profit forfeited when the trend ultimately reverses. Moving one’s stop quickly to breakeven uses similar logic. Trading concurrent positions results in smoother profit (higher overall W), as partial positions that get closed lock in profit, but curtails profit (lower R) on the closures; while all positions are subjected to the full weight of loss, if the protective stop is hit. Trading without protective stops guarantees a 100% W, but potentially infinite risk (unlimited negative R). Not recommended. And with regard to money management (MM), similar types of compromises apply: Scaling into trades (‘pyramiding’) escalates profits (return) if the market trends; but increases risk in like proportion, as losses will be greater if the hoped-for trend fails. Averaging down into a position will increase profit in a ranging market, as prices bounce back, but leaves one open to proportionally greater loss if the bounce doesn’t occur, i.e. prices decide to trend adversely. Increasing position size increases both risk and return in exactly direct proportion to each other. There is no perfect ‘Holy Grail’ method. The above compromises are implicit in all systems. To increase return, one has to increase risk of drawdown, in some way. The fact that so many diverse and conflicting approaches are recommended by successful traders suggests that price movement is very close to random in its nature. Put another way, trends do exist, but their occurrence is random, and likewise their length. To be consistently successful , then, a system must identify and exploit element(s) of non-randomness amongst the chaos. ‘Non-randomness’ might mean that, on balance , once a trend is established, it is more likely to continue than not; and/or that prices are more likely than not to reverse at extremes, points of prior S/R, pivots, or Fibos; and so on. Combinations, or confluences, of these factors can provide the necessary, albeit very small , edge. Statistical significance is important: 7 successes in 10 trials is fortuitous; 700 out of 1,000 is not. Consequently, the only function of MM should be to preserve capital, allowing one’s account to survive a sequence of losses. MM has no bearing on expectancy, apart from magnifying its result. Selection of timeframe likewise provides similar compromises. Shorter means potentially, the following benefits: More frequent opportunity to compound gains (and losses). Greater, and accelerated, opportunity for positive expectancy (edge) to shine through (enhances return, mitigates risk). Accelerates the learning curve ("feel" for the market, and what is likely or unlikely, to happen; experience in trade management). Accelerated attainment of both statistical and psychological confidence. Higher throughput = smoother, more consistent income (less jaggedness in equity curve). Crucial if trading is one’s sole/primary form of income, e.g. in a 5-trade losing sequence, a trader who makes 5 trades per day incurs negative income for a day; one trade per week incurs negative income for an entire month. Less time to agonize over losses, and develop emotional attachment to individual trades. Greater number of opportunities reduces temptation to (over)trade poorer setups. But also the following very significant drawbacks: Trading smaller movements greatly increases the significance of transaction costs (e.g. trading a 20 pip move with a 4 pip spread requires a 20% edge just to break even). The shorter the timeframe, the greater the tendency for randomness in price movement (trends are shorter and more erratic). Lifestyle implication: monitoring trades is both labor intensive and time-consuming. All technical analysis makes the assumption that the elements of the past are, on balance, more likely to repeat themselves than not, in the imminent future. As such, TA is always a ‘lagging’ process; all indicators tend to lag more so than price action. Many traders underestimate the inherent costs. Beyond transaction costs (spread and rollover), there is the cost in allowing a margin for error in being unable to forecast swing highs and lows. One forfeits significant profit while allowing an emerging movement to confirm itself, ands also waiting for price to retreat to a trailing stop. It is arguably easier to forecast imminent price direction than the length of the move. But price must move far enough to overcome all of these costs. To state the obvious, the bottom line is that, if it moves far enough, and frequently enough, one profits; whenever it doesn’t, one loses. Hopefully all of this illustrates some of the delicate balances involved, and that consistently profitable trading is extremely difficult. No matter how effective one’s method, or how disciplined one’s execution of it, frequent and/or prolonged drawdowns are inevitable. Sorry that I’ve gotten off topic here (perhaps this post should be moved elsewhere), but the above pretty much summarizes all of my conclusions, after 5 years of reading, studying, and testing various systems. However, even after this length of apprenticeship, I am neither an experienced nor successful trader. David

excellent analysis

Wow David, that was quite a long but interesting summary. Thanks. Valuable for a newbie to FX like me. Just out of curiousity, what method/system are you trading with at the moment??

--- 帖子 #316 ---
hanover you mentioned "To be consistently successful, then, a system must identify and exploit element(s) of non-randomness amongst the chaos. " this is exactly what i have been trying to do with my research and studies. i think i have been successful in identifying predictable patterns in behavior. i hope to exploit these in my trading. i have a thread, but i wont post it here. you mentioned the trend having an element of non randomness. i agree, but its hard to objectively identify a trend in real time. plus, how do you know when the trend will end and is this a retrace or the end? etc. the same problems still arise. how do you know where to place your stop?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
This thread is about discussing and improving the BAT method, and I don't want to hijack it. Will try not to digress so much this time. I've already posted my thoughts on BAT (see posts #145, #191 in this thread). I haven't spent a lot of time testing BAT myself, but I have been following this thread. BAT interests me because it is a user-friendly, tightly defined system that attempts to exploit both trending and ranging markets. I prefer predominantly mechanical systems because they lend themselves better to objective scrutiny, and automated testing. I understand that Team Aphid are performing testing aimed at squeezing more profit from BAT's exit method. Given that BAT uses arbitrary rather than technically based exit methods, I suspect it might be difficult to enhance the exit significantly, aside from simply "curve fitting". Perhaps (and also in response to AverageYuppy, #316) I should explain what I mean by "arbitrary" and "technically based" methods of exit. Setting protective or trailing stops, and/or profit targets, at (say) 50 or 100 pips, simply because these are nice round numbers, is what I term an "arbitrary" method. IMHO, simply tinkering with these numbers is unlikely to achieving anything significant, other than adjusting the compromises outlined in my prior post (#313). That is akin to what is widely described as curve fitting. By a "technically based" exit I mean that there must be some probabilistic reason that the trend is more likely to reverse at a particular point, than anywhere else along the way, such as it encountering strong prior resistance, or (even better) a confluence of other widely adhered to elements (Fibo, pivots, etc). I disagree with the textbooks that state that exit is, per se , more important than entry. IMHO something is important only to the extent that it contributes to the likelihood of a profitable trade. Hence a good entry setup adds probabilistic value, an arbitrary exit does not. Surely if there were certain exit methods that significantly outperformed others, they would have been widely documented. As it is, opinion is largely divided, for example – even seemingly amongst expert traders – between using trailing stops, and taking profits. In this context, exit has been made a very subjective process, one that is more about balancing risk/return to suit personal tolerance levels, than providing mathematical enhancement. So in terms of psychology , it can be very important; but that has little to do with improving the BAT, or any other, method. Fukinagashi (#314) – thanks for the feedback. Fjfx (#315) – I'm fairly new to FF, have recently subscribed to the James16 private forum, and am currently trying to get my head around the methods and ideas outlined there. Hope to start demo trading systems on both the public and private forums (in parallel if I can, to save time). BAT is likely to be one of those systems. However, I'm trying to narrow my focus somewhat. Five years of research has left me burnt out from information overload. AverageYuppy (#316) – it's always gratifying to find somebody who thinks along similar lines. If you've managed to identify patterns that are significantly predictable, then I expect you're further down the track than I currently am. Cheers David

i completely agree with your statement about arbitrary numbers. i have been adamantly opposed to this in the use of stop losses or entries the reason is that the # is usually based upon manual backtesting and basically you are trying to use the past to predict the future...this hardly ever works for long . this is basically "curve fitting" as you have described. this is a reason many of the systems listed here...after a while...after market conditions change...you never hear about them because...they dont work for long. hanover: again...i THINK i am on to something..but we shall see. i have my experimental trading system thread. backtesting works. it is completely mechanical. everyting is...to the T. there is nothing arbitrary or subjective about it. but i cant go back far enough. the only way is to test this thing in real time...

I see less people then before in the thread....now long GBP/USD --------------------------- searching traders for cooperation

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I have been looking at my charts and think maybe we can reduce the number of false trades by placing the 1st buy/sell stop at the high of the bar that breaks through the BAT lines. Obviously you will need to wait for the bar to close. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Sorry, I haven't made the time to test this idea, but I post it here, in case anybody wants to investigate further. I actually thought of this some time back, but was too embarrassed to post something that I hadn't tested properly, in case it turned out to be a dismal failure. And it seemed so simple that I figured it must have already been tested, and discarded. My first take was that an uptrend is defined by progressively higher BAT buy signals, and higher sell signals; a downtrend by progressively lower ones. Then I modified the idea as follows: enter long only if the current buy signal is higher than the most recent sell signal; enter short only if the current sell signal is lower than the most recent buy signal. Or, in other words, if the (Trade #1 portion of the) previous trade was (or would have been) a winner, don't immediately enter in the opposite direction. This tends to prevent trading against some of the more "severe" trends. I had a quick look at GBPUSD,H1 and it seemed to filter out some losing Trade#1 trades. Obviously it would need to be tested more exhaustively, to see whether the winners filtered out (especially Trades #2, #3, #4) offset the losing Trade #1s. As far as I can tell, the situations where winning Trade #1s get filtered out are where: there is a significant enough retracement following a huge winning trade (then the retracement is missed); there is a deep enough retracement in the prevailing trend (then the next impulse move is missed); prices are moving in some kind of widening wedge. An obvious variation would be to take smaller size positions (possibly for Trade #1only?) when trading contrary to the above rule. The trend determination could also allow re-weighting the sizes across trades #1, and #2-4, if the trend is particularly strong (e.g. three successive alternating signals are progressively higher, or lower).

Facinating thread. I've read it again from one to ThreeTwentyTwo and gained much in tips and insights. Especialy the various methods and ideas on filtering and trend indication. I am still having good success utilizing the 15m chart with modifyed ATR BAT settings, nothing really to report. But it is proving to be helpful in validating entry/exit setups. : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Thank you for your suggestion, David. Please don't be embarrassed because the main goal of this thread is throwing ideas, testing them and seeing if they work. We'll start testing your idea, but as you all know, it may take some time to finish it as we are using 1Hr charts. Thanks again for all your contributions to this thread.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi David A quick look on the chart shows that this techtique would have saved a number of false signals; so would have trades in the direction of the 72EMA which was mentioned by a member earlier. The only drawback is that you may miss a potential reversal point, it really needs a proper forward testing (not back test) to prove which one, filter or no filter, is advantageous. Eye balling shows: Filter

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Just for your info., we did a quick test (just for two months in 2006) by using David's following filter and the results are -58 pips for November 2006 and -428 pips for December 2006. The live trading for these months produced +82 and +520 pips for us. We'll do some forward testing as well.

Short cable @ 1.9595 with limit orders in place. Just curious to know TA's thoughts on the swing high for this trade. I placed mine at 1.9681, which is also an hourly pivot level.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Unfortunately, at this time my ECN broker (efxgroup) does not offer a charting package or datafeed for metatrader. Therefore, I'm curious to how you would deal with the big difference in spread when using Alpari data with my ECN order entry. On the cable, it's no big deal and usually within a pip or 2, but for EURAUD, it's always much more. For example, right now Alpari is quoting EURAUD at 6690 ask and 6675 offer, while EFXGroup is quoting 6684 ask and 6679 bid. I find that most times, there is a pretty constant 5 pip difference between efx and alpari, with efx always inside alpari's spread. Therefore, would it make sense to use Alpari data, then adjust for the quote difference when placing stop or limit orders. For example, right now using Alpari data, we'd have a sell stop in place to short EURAUD at 6638. If I entered my order to sell at 6643, and did the same for all future orders, would that in the long run effectively compensate for the discrepency?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
We placed our swing high @ 1.9679, high of 08:00hr bar (Alpari server), which is almost identical with yours.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
You are right and we are doing the same way you asked, adjusting the quote difference between Alpari and our broker when placing stop and limit orders. We believe this method would compensate effectively in the long run. Good point, thanks for asking.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks TA! One other question - with regards to news. For example, right now with news coming out that could dramatically affect the cable, do you leave your limit orders in place, or cancel and replace once the whipsaw has settled.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Team Aphid, I like your indicator but I don't know Metatrader language. If possible,I would like to know the formula with common math lanuguage so I can see it on tradestation and see how it works on stocks and futures. When you want regards

We have forwarded your request to our programmer.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
thank you very very much

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I am also interested in reproducing this indicator for FibonacciTrader v4.0!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thank you TeamAphid for nice system. I've been using your indicator for a while (PF) to trail stops and like it very much, many thanks. I also just started experimenting, using it for entries with a small adjustment. Instead of taking initial position on price touching 'bat', I'd wait for 50% fib ret with some kind of confluence and open 2 units.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Interesting. Of course I don't have the trade-by-trade details of your test results, but I suspect this means that some of the biggest moves are being filtered out (if I understand correctly, BAT trade #1s are a trend following system, which generally require a few sizeable moves to offset the more frequent small losses). Of course the filtering will also be eliminating trades #2-#4 whenever it occurs. Hence my subsequent idea for re-weighting, rather than removing the entire set of trades. Currently the prospective "ranging component" is out-weighing the prospective "trending component" in each set, at least potentially, by 3 units to 1. Elliott wave theory tells us that wave 3 is generally the longest impulse wave. I would have thought that the filtering would be likely to preclude entry on wave 1 than wave 3, unless the wave 2 retracement is significant. Hopefully the attached chart clarifies my point. The trend filter eliminates the marginally profitable wave 1 trade (red X), and also the losing wave 2 trade (blue X), but permits entry into the hugely profitable wave 3 trade (which actually gets stopped out as it hits the prior swing low, but that is an exit issue). The Elliott wave truism was a consideration behind my idea. Thanks for testing this. Hopefully, a post-mortem along the lines of (i) separating results for trade #1, and trade #2-4, and (ii) whether or not it's the fact that a few sizeable wins are being missed, and where these big wins occur during a trend (early, midstream, late) etc, will tell you why applying a trend filter has proven unprofitable. It seems odd to me that a predominatly trend following system would not be enhanced by some kind of trend filtering. David

We trade BAT 100% mechanical, therefore, we leave our limit orders in place during news time.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thanks for contributing. You can have tighter stop loss with this method but you can miss out some very profitable trades if the breakout is strong. Check out GBPJPY long trade on Jan 11th, 2007 @07:00 bar. You miss 859 pips profit if you use this method for entry. Or check out GBPUSD long trade on Nov 17th, 2006 @ 16:00 bar. You miss 533 pips profit. It is essential to catch these big movers. Your idea should be tested properly, but we believe the amount of pips you save will not compensate the ones from miss-out trades.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi David, We have tested your following idea only, not the one "re-weighting the sizes accross trade # 1". Re-weighting would be safer not to miss out any trades. On the other hand, we haven't thought about using Elliot Waves because we believe the waves add more subjectivity to mechanical systems. Thanks for your time and valuable contributions.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi, are those NET pips?Is the spread included?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I have visually backtested this system and the best method i come up with as far as money management goes is: open 3 positions on line cross. #1....has a fixed TP with trail of 30 pips. (which break even at 30 pips too) #2....exits only when another line break occurs in the opposite direction, i.e if u entered on a red cross, then a blue cross will be the exit signal #3...this position has no TP but has a trail of 30 pips. this has greatly improved the ods. Also, i didn't use the rentries on a negative swing (fib 382 and 618). all three positions must be = to your total leverage risk, for me it is 1:10 soa 10,000 account opens each position with 0.33 lots

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I wasn't suggesting that we get involved with Elliott wave complexities, other than the idea that the first wave in a sustained trend is frequently shorter than the subsequent ones. David

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Thank you for sharing your ideas to improve BAT, we appreciate that. Have you done a proper backtest for 2006 by using these rules? If yes, can you please also share your backtest results with us so that we can compare with original test results?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
We agree with you. On the other hand, we give a great value and consideration on each idea from members to improve this system, therefore, either applicable or not, either tested or not, please keep thinking aloud and sharing with us. Thanks again for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
TeamAphid, it is a pleasure to read and reread this thread as you have been very gracious in your responses to the many ideas and tid bits shared by FF members in this thread. It is this "grace" you've shown to all that will allow many good things to come out of this simple strategy and thread. Thank you again for all your time and energy. Thom

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Money management seems to be a real nail biter on this one. Consider this -- if you divide up your risk by four when you enter on the ATR touch, and price continues in your direction, you are only risking (on 2% risk) .5%. That would suck. Basically, you're going to kick yourself for not risking your full 2%... So that's why there are some issues with this system in terms of entries and probably why most people have a heck of a time trying to find that all-in-one range + trend system. What I would suggest is possibly dividing your risk by four as we have discussed, but if price reaches the 1.618 level, you pyramid up into your full risk position. This way, you are letting the market tell you what it's doing. If it gets to 1.618 and turns around, well... tough... but I bet that doesn't happen often. Furthermore, you'd only had risked a total of 2% anyway... This is much better than just doing .5%... Most people won't be able to handle that mentally.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thank you Thom, for your kind words and full support. We are trying to keep this thread alive as much as we can so that it can be improved and every member in FF can benefit. To be honest, we are happy with entry and range trading techniques of the BAT, on the other hand we are aware that we leave too many pips on table because of trend following ability of BAT indicator especially if the trend is short lived. We tried to filter out some losing trades as some of the valuable contributers did here, but then there is a risk of filtering out the big winners which shouldn't be for a trend following system. Therefore, instead of trying to improve the winning ratio (winning ratio varies between 50% - 60% in times, and we believe this is more than enough to trade a mechanical system profitably), if the ratio of Pips actually gained / Max. potential pips can be improved, it would be huge for BAT and we believe BAT has this potential. Thanks again for everybody trying to contribute and develop BAT.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Thank you for all your effort here and for sharing it with us. My question is on the initial entry into a trade you say to let it run until it hits the opposite bat line. Doesn't this sometimes leave alot of pips on the table compaired to taking profit at the first or second fib line? Thanks Again.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
The BAT is based on the volatility breakout principle. Let’s look at the indicator. First we must calculate, for each bar, the Average True Range (ATR). The ATR is a measure of volatility which takes into account the daily pip spread between the highs and the lows, adjusted to include gaps. For BAT GBPUSD we use a 5 period ATR, if too many bars are used for the ATR, the indicator becomes unresponsive to changes in volatility. Next we assign a factor (coefficient) by which we multiply the ATR. The factor is just a number we arrived at through testing – please read at bottom of post how we decide on a number. After we have multiplied the factor times the ATR we arrive at a value, which we call the Pip Move. If the factor is too small we will get too many small trades, if it’s too large we will get too few trades and miss much of the action. The Pip Move will vary in direct proportion to the current volatility. The factor, once we choose its value, does not change from bar to bar, it is a constant, but the ATR varies with the market. The Pip Move is the product of a variable (the ATR) times a constant (the factor or coefficient). At the close of each bar we can update the ATR using the high, low and close prices for the past N bars, where N is the number of days length for the ATR. We then find the Pip Move, by multiplying the ATR times the factor, and we add the Pip Move to the current bar close to get the next bars’ long target. We also subtract the Pip Move from the current bar close the get the next bar‘s short target. Picture the long and short targets as forming lines above and below the market. We buy at the top line when it’s penetrated and sell at the bottom line when it is penetrated. Something important you will notice is that the signal line will always move in one direction only. The top band can only go down once it started and the bottom line can only move up. This creates a “step” or “ratchet” effect. The program picks up which band must be switched “off” for the trade so we will only see the active line. So in an uptrend the bottom line will start to follow price action and adapt to market conditions, and in a downtrend the top line will follow price action and adapt to market conditions. In coding the indicator the only way I could figure out to decide which signal line to display was to start in the past somewhere and pick up which direction was the active one. Let’s look at a quick example. Trading GBPUSD, and the ATR over a 5 bar period is .0025 (or 25 pips), and we use a factor (coefficient) of 4, which we multiply by the ATR: 5 period ATR = .0025 (25 pips) 4 * ATR = .0100 (100 pips) move. Now, if the ATR increases, so does the pip move necessary to generate a trade. The reverse is equally true. 5 period ATR = .0050 (50 pips) 4 * ATR = .0200 (200 pips) move. 5 period ATR = .0010 (10 pips) 4 * ATR = .0100 (40 pips) move. Before flooding the thread with the “optimal settings”, please first test and compare it with our results. Team Aphid never optimize a system, we go for robust. The system does not need to be perfectly tuned to make good profits – it only has to be “in the ball park”. Too many times we have seen optimized systems get hurt because a small deviation in market conditions cause an optimized value to fail. With a “robust” setting we are sure that values on both sides of our settings will still give winning results. It might not always be the best settings, but they are most probably the safest. Zeus

Yes it does, please see post #348 for further comment.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Sometime ago someone posted the idea of adding a 72EMA to your system.I haven't done a complete backtest of 2006 but this additional filter keeps you out of alot of neg. trades if you don't trade against the slope. Have you had a chance to backtest this additional filter to see if it improves over all results for the year? Thanks again for sharing this great system.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
We haven't yet, but it is definitely in our agenda.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Forgive me if this has been explained earlier but do we open additional lots on every retracement to fib lines (some trades may have several ) or just the first retrace?For example,price may retrace to 61.8 level then back to initial entry then back to 61.8 again. I,m beginning to see the beauty in this system. Even if initial lot doesn't TP, lots 2,3 and 4 can give you a nice gain overall on the trade. thank you

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Yes, we open additional positions on every retracement unless price hits 161.8 fib level. When it does, we don't open positions for trade #2, 3 and 4 anymore.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi TA: Just curious where you placed the swing low on the last long entry. 157 pips south seems a bit far away.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
fxgorilla- I've got mine drawn the same way as yours. It certainly is a long way but it is done per the strategy which says to draw the fib to a "recent or significant" low. Putting the SL 10 pips below that will test the nerves. At the time of this post however, the blue BAT line is already coming north of that original SL point, so I've moved the SL to correspond with the price the blue BAT line is at.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
We have put our SL @ 1.9480 minus 10 pips as it is the recent and significant swing low. We agree it is a bit far away, but blue BAT line adjusts itself a few bars later and increases rapidly during the consolidation of sharp upward move. Think this way; there may be a correction after such a sharp increase and SL @1.9480 minus 10 pips gives a good chance for your position to live. By the way, you can profit from range trading positions during the consolidation period.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
When price passes by a Bat line but doesn't touch it , do we still make a trade? If we are waiting for an actual touch, I can see in the past we would have missed out on alot of trades. An example of this would be on the 24th of this month at 6:00 on the MT4 platform. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
We are putting our limit order just under blue BAT line or just above red BAT line. So it is impossible to miss out any trade. In your example, blue BAT line is @ 1.977020, therefore if you put a SELL limit order @ 1.9770 or 1.9769, you won't miss out this trade. You should use limit orders as you see the trigger levels beforehand, you don't need to wait for the price to touch the BAT line and send market order which will cause miss-outs.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Thanks for clearing this up. I think alot of people were waiting for the actual touch of the Bat line and letting passbys of the line go without a trade.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi TA: Can you explain where the 5356 is coming from in the calculations below?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Please check excel spreadsheet showing backtest results. It is total gain in 2006 by trading 4 lots.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Whew! OK, so right now after NFP I'm GBPUSD long from 9728 with 2 lots and current stop at 9632, 10 below swing at 9642. Since there's no blue bat line below, does 9632 also become the reversal point to go short?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Just had first EURAUD order triggered - Short @ 6803

--- 帖子 #366 ---
OK, so the blue bat line has just appeared below the horizon @ 9546, which would work out to something like a near 175 pip stop from long entry @ 9728. Where are you placing your SAR?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
ok, i'll be using the H1 chart to do so

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I want to make an EA for this indicator, is it possible to get the original programmer in this room?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Fukinagashi has already made an EA...see here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=14073

--- 帖子 #370 ---
If recent swing low/high is much higher/lower than BAT lines, then stop loss is swing low - 10 / high + 10, not the BAT line. In your case, swing low is @ 9642 (2/2/2007 09:00 bar (alpari)), therefore stoploss will be @ 9632, which is 96 pips away from entry, not 175 pips. For SAR, you need to wait for price to hit blue BAT line, not the swing low - 10.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
yes, but he does not allow it to be expanded. We want mq4

He will not provide the source to any of his programs since he dislike his code being exploited for profitability by those selling systems rying to rip us off.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Ok fine, i'll just do it from scratch then. i already have the indicator and i have spotted a few logical errors in his EA that i wont discuss here. Bye

You can ask him to fix whatever you see as in error. I do know he will accomodate whatever changes you recommend.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I think an open source version of the BAT EA is a great idea. I looked at the one Fukinagashi did but it's impossible to do true "due diligence" without being able to see the source. Also frustrating is the inability to mod the EA to your own personal preference without Fukinagashi's help. I appreciate the work Fukinagashi has done but there is no way I would trust my hard earned money to an EA that I didn't understand the full implications of. I understand Fukinagashi's concerns about code theft but since you can hire russian firms to decompile ex4's for cheap I think it's an undefeatable problem is someone is keen. Brian

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi All this talk about an EA is busy taking the focus away from the BAT and the intended purpose of this thread. I am the programmer of the team and will NOT get involved in writing any EA's for it in the near future. If anybody else wants to do it feel free, but please do so in another thread. The reason for this post is to prevent a perfectly good thread from ending up as a testing ground or an EA tutorial. So far the system rules are available; the indicator is there, as well as a set of test data going back more than a year. It should be enough information to write and test an EA. But like I've requested, please do so on another thread. Team Aphid

Hello everybody, usualy sorry for my english and worm thankfull to team Aphid for the sistem Someone have the same signal I have on £$ (short from around 1.9616 with TP around 1.956) and £¥ (short from 237.25 and TP around 237.45) ???? Just to be sure that my settings are right? About improvement and suggestion for you , dear Team, sorry but I'm so small trader that I can be just a son of aphid now later, who knows??? Laoma

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Great work &amp; thanks for sharing. Have you considered a time of day filter? It seems that the trades taken between 11pm &amp; 6am have a poorer result than those in the other sessions.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi Laoma, Your short levels are correct, but how did you find TPs since there is no TP in original BAT system (for #1 trades). We use red BAT line to take profit for short trades.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
No, we haven't considered that kind of filter, but we will test it for a couple of months and see if it filters profitable trades as well, especially big ones. By the way, do you mean Alpari server time or EST or else?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
The TP that I mean is the 161,8 level (here I trade a little bit free of rules, I TP as I fill abuot the trade and watching others time frame signals)

--- 帖子 #382 ---
TA, I just based this on the results that you posted for 2006, using an excel pivot table to summarise trades by left hand hour column. Many of the overnight hours have a negative result. (e.g. 23h 4 trades -121pips, 0h 4 trades -61pips. Total 11pm-6am 26 trades, average only +5 pips compared with an average of +12 pips for all trades)

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi TA: Can you clarify how you compensate for spread when placing orders off the bat lines. For example, right now on EURAUD, my red bat line is at 6715, the Alpari feed has a ask/bid of 6691/6676 and my ecn is showing 6687/6691. Where would you place the order for the buy at the Alpari 6715? If the red bat line is charting the bid, then would the formula be RED BAT LINE + ALPARI SPREAD - 4

--- 帖子 #384 ---
TEAM APHID Set a buy stop at 9615 cable Monday night before retiring, based on the projected red-bat line break. Although the actual bat-line changed overnight by 15 pips, I still awakened today, Tuesday morning, to find a pleasant profit based on where I thought the 161 would wind-up (it too changed). Is it correct that most of the movements occur during the European and UK session, while we yanks are sound asleep, enjoying pipdreams??

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Spread issue is always a problem since different brokers offer different spreads , naturally. And it is especially a big problem with EURAUD because Alpari spread is 15 pips for this currency. You can use your formula, or another oprtion we can offer is (in case you can follow prices when trigger levels are approaching) that you can wait for Alpari to hit red or blue BAT line (for BUY orders only) and then instantly execute a market order from your ecn. This will save you some pips. If you need to put limit orders and go away, and then the only option is to add 15 pips to the trade level (for BUY orders only) since Alpari is charting the bid price.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Most of the movements in FX market occur during London and US sessions. But we are trading this method 100% mechanical and taking every trade triggered by BAT indicator. Statiscally, it may be true that losers are more in Sydney and Tokyo sessions as indicated before by a member, but we are not using any time filter to trade this system at the moment.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi Team Aphid, thanks for the mechanical Bat system of yours. I have some ideas/input which I would like to share. I believe it can improve the net result ie more pips in the pocket and maybe less stress. I have read in the thread that there are a number of traders who get a heart attack when faced with some of the large losses. I am playing around with the following idea: A) you construct your swing as per your rules. Add the following fib extensions 127%, 200% 261% B) in the BAT indicator change the factor from 4,0 to 3,5 C) Make the 61% retracement level your stop loss D) Enter 5 positions. This equates on average to about 2% of capital risk. E) Take profit at the following levels 2 positions at the 127% 1 position at 168% 1 position at 200% 1 position at 261%. this position can be let open and eventually to be stopped out , when triggered by the next BAT line to change course. I am busy doing some backtesting and I am still busy with April 2006. It does seem to me that the above method does offer good Risk/reward ratios. Furthermore your losses are contained. Most of the times the price will make a spike and then retrace. By changing the factor down to 3,5 a small profit at the 127% level can be taken. Furthermore the number of trades are not increased significantly. The above is just an idea . Positive criticism is surely appreciated. I have included a sketch showing the 2 fib extensions. The BAT blue/red is he original , while the BAT light blue/ orange is the modified factor Regards Eckbert

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Eckbert, I have manually backtested a similar approach: enter with 3 units at break of BAT, take first profit at 168%, then stoploss gets moved from swing low to the 127%, take second profit at 227%, last unit until it gets stopped out by BAT line or the 127% trailed stop. I didn't enter any position at the 38.2% and 61.8% fibs. I get a higher result with less draw down, like you describe with your tests. (I only backtested this approach for January 2006 to August 2006) One weakness is the trailed 127% trailed stop though, often price will retrace beyond this level before taking off again, so I think the next test will be without this trailed stop or a modified one.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi Islander, yes I agree with your trailing stop. Backtesting is off course the ideal world. In real live your emotions etc come to the fore. That is why in my backtesting I only took profit on the values physically hit. In other words, if the price hit the 1,618 ext and then retraced to hit the 0,618 stop loss so be it. To me this is the worst case scenario. I tried to implement a system where I must not make a rational decision, which will in any case be not right. This is what I like about the BAT system. There are no indicators etc. There is a level which will trigger a trade. In advance you can enter all the different levels and basically go and play golf or if you stay in Hawaii go and surf. In my back testing I did not change my stop once I reached a certain level. This can improve your profitability, but quite right as you say, it will hit your trailing stop and then continue. Remember you must leave room for the market to breath and stretch its muscles. A tight stop will kill you, and the brokers know this. If I can bag a profit at the 1,27 ext great. This position has greatly reduced my risk, especially in a ranging market. This is where you want to cut your losses. Regards Eckbert. PS, it seems that using the 1,382 ext is actually better than the 1,27 ext.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi TA: First, I just want to take a breather and say thank you for sharing the Bat with all of us here on FF. Just for clarification, when you say that it is possible to open with 2 lots, this must mean that you are also willing to increase your total risk per trade by 25%? Otherwise, allocating the same 2% (or whatever %R per trade you are using) across either 4 or 5 lots would not result in any net difference, as you would simply be decreasing the lot size. Also, with regards to money management and risk allocation per lot, would it make sense to weight the risk allocation per lot based upon the historical average win ratio of each lot? For example, in 2006, about 60% of all the pips were generated from Lot #1, therefore, if you're total risk per trade is 2%, would it make sense to allocate 1.2% to Lot #1, and then to distribute the .8% over the remaining lots, perhaps also on a weighted basis? All the best, Michael

--- 帖子 #391 ---
One other question, must you wait for the Bat line to turn horizontal before moving your stop from swing-10? For example, on the chart below, where would your stop be for the currenct EURAUD long?

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Thanks for sharing your ideas, they are well explained and 100% mechanical which is suitable to the nature of BAT system. We liked your strategy and we have decided to test them properly. Just a couple of issues; instead of using 127% extension, we are going to use 138%. And we have a concern in regard to TP levels. If the swing low/high is too close to BAT lines, then you will be exiting too early @138% level (40% of the trade). Just check out GBPUSD chart and go to January 3rd, 2006 02.00hr bar. Swing low is at 01.00 hr bar and too close. We agree you'll not lose already gained pips with these TP levels, but on th other hand, you'll lose many potential pips if swing low/high is too close such as the one in above example. Anyway, it is a tradeoff, and we never know without proper testing. We'll inform you about the outcome of our tests. Thanks for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
You are right, but as you indicated on your second paragraph, 60% of all pips were generated by Trade #1, therefore we consider that this result is worth of increasing the risk. Re. your second question, yes it makes sense to allocate risk per lot. But, generally speaking, we are looking at the bigger picture with respect to our account balance, not trade by trade. We know that many systems use drawdown, risk/reward ratios, winning ratio and all other statistical figures based on single trade results. We prefer using monthly figures, because we believe a mechanical system generating consistent monthly profit is worth to trade depending on other monthly statistics. Thanks for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
You shouldn't wait for the BAT line to turn horizantal to trail the SL. After the BAT line appears, just check out the value of BAT line for the bar previous to the current bar (because the value of BAT line changes on cuurent bar, but it is fixed at previous bar). Therefore if current bar is, let's say 15.00hr bar, look at the 14:00hr bar for SL level.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi Team Aphid, The longer I am carryung out my backtests, it seems that the 138%Ext is the way to go. I ahve started with 127%, but I am entering the 138% levels in Excel spreadsheet. So once I am finished I can just cahnge the values. Regarding the swing low/highs to close to the BAT line, yes it does happen. However you can always reenter after a conslidation. But as you say, you win some and you lose some. I am looking for a strategy that provides me a good return and with my risk in check. Unfortunately I am a conservative gambler http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Regards Eckbert

--- 帖子 #396 ---
We have finished testing GBPUSD for the first three months of 2006 by using Eckbert's following rules except taking the first profit at 138% instead of 127% (we used 5 lots strategy for all options). Original BAT rules Eckbert's rules Eckbert's rules with different exits (with factor 4) (with factor 3.50) 1 @ 138%, 1@ 200%, 1 @ 261% 2 @ next BAT line Jan 367 199 432 Feb 562 -336 -453 Mar 1157 657 1517 Total 2086 520 1496 When doing the backtest, following issues were observed: 1- New rules do not trade ranging market conditions (works only in trending markets with small retracement after entry) whereas original BAT rules benefit from both ranging and trending markets. 2- 61.8% retracement level for SL is too close, especially for volatile pairs, therefore it adversely affects win/loss ratio of the system. 3- As it was indicated before, 60% of profits are generated from Trade #1, therefore exit levels are too close, as well (difference between total pips proves this). 4- We still believe factor 4 is more appropriate. Thanks again for your ideas and contributions.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi Team Aphid, thanks for your response. A question: how do you define a range trading market? In your analysis, the first figure (367) is the original BAT, (199) Eckbert's rule and (432) Eckbert's rules with revised exits? Is it possible to post your results. If you say that a 61% retracement as stop loss is to close, what would you consider a reasonable stop loss? Regards Eckbert

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Team Aphid, I have studies BAT document again. In a range trade you show the aqua arrows as a reentry. Where is your exit. As requested in the previuos post, please give me a definition on a range trade. A thought not yet tried out, would the BAT lines on a 4hr chart provide a clue for a range? Your backtest results posted in the previous post : is it possible to define the entry and exit levels, or are they the same as per the original BAT document on post 35. Regards Eckbert

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Please see the answers within your text.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Exit for range trade entries is the 100% level (entry level for trade #1). If the price swings between 38.2% and 161.8% levels, we accept it as a range trade (please see page 8 of original BAT document). We have backtested by using your rules. Therefore, entry level is the BAT line. Exit levels are 2 @ 138%, 1 @ 161.8%, 1 @ 200%, 1 @ 261.8%. Exit levels for revised method are 1 @ 138%, 1 @ 200%, 1 @ 261.8% and 2 @ opposite BAT line. To make comparison, we have also included original BAT backtest results (5 lot version), and it still has a better winning ratio and more pips.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi Team Aphid, thanks for the above explanation. I did not read the section on the range trade properly. But that all makes sense now. Once you have entered the 5 trades, do you take your profit as per the Full Monty procedure?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
The exit for 3 lots is at 100% level (range trading) and the exit for remaining 2 lots is when the price hits opposite BAT line.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Most of this conversation was beyond the paygrade of a newstrader, but if I understand it correctly, then a 61.8 SL during Thursday's BOE announcement would have left....oh approximately 100 pips on the table? BAT was right on the money; on several occasions now it added a different dimension to newstrading as it suggests the potential direction. Depending on the trader's risk tolerance, one can enter well before the announcement and truly maximize profits.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
hi Team Aphid, thank you so much for your great method and outstanding support. I read that you're trading GBPJPY and GBPUSD with BAT. If I traded BAT live which currencies do you recommend (w/ priorities). PS: I try to keep pace with all the new posts but if I missed a posts which would be the answer to my question please tell me

--- 帖子 #405 ---
We are trading EURAUD as well, but some brokers offer this currency with a very wide spread. Therefore, if you have a limitation, give priority to GBPUSD and then GBPJPY. Although they have similar winning ratios, GBPUSD generated more pips and you will also have spread advantage. If you can trade both, you will be trading USDJPY synthetically as well.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi TA: Just wanted to compare notes on the current GBPJPY trade. As you can see on the chart below, there was a nasty little spike up which triggered a long, followed by a major spike down which triggered the long @ 61.8, and (would have even triggered the long at 38.2 - but I had not yet placed the limit order), and finally broke the SAR @ 236.81. We are now short with limit orders in place to short at the 61.8 and 38.2. Just wanted to double check to see if we're on the same page... All the best, Michael

--- 帖子 #407 ---
yeah, thats what i have as well, not looking too healthy at min is it!

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Due to sudden drop on GBPJPY just after triggering long trade at 06:00 bar, indicator could not put blue BAT line (because the indicator puts opposite BAT line after the close of next bar), and the stop for long trade was at 236.93 -10 pips = 236.83 Since we did not see blue BAT line, you can use 236.83 level as SAR. And then red BAT line appeared at 09:00 bar. As a result, we are on the same page.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I want to lighten up a bit, eventhough I haven't tested fully, here is my proposed filter : About Entry 1. EMA55(Median, not close price), if it is against the signal from BAT line, do not take trade, if it is flat or confirm the direction of the signal, do take the trade 2. Wait a bar after "touching bar" (bar that make BAT line switch to the other BAT line), if it can break the high (long example) of "touching bar" then, take the trade About Exit 1. take partial profit when EMA55 flat for 2-3 bars These may be curve fitting, but combine with simple resistance/support would be a wonderful system, just my feeling, not yet get some facts.

Hello all! I Address to the author of the indicator. (look on attached Screen short ) . Yesterday on February, 13th, 2007 , traded GBP/USD (H1) (in the indicator of installation 5 and 4 as in the description to the indicator) and has seen not drawing of a dark blue line after the schedule of the price has crossed red line BAT. Has checked up this indicator on other terminals MT4 , the same, has not drawn a dark blue line after the red line has been crossed. What does it mean? (I have changed data on 5 and 3, and there was a piece of a dark blue line). Wait answer from author BAT ATR v.1

--- 帖子 #411 ---
my meta trader looks exactly the same as well, no blue line drawn. i have just gone long again on cable for the third time after two losses, hopefully this is the breakout

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Please use Alpari server. We see the blue BAT line, please see the chart below.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Please see post #412.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
thanks for the prompt reply

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I think that the indicator should be corrected by the author. In any case of trade the dark blue line should be drawn even by the shortest piece. Otherwise (on February, 13th, 2007 GBP/USD ) we lose a basic level of orientation in the tenders.

I have lead experiment and have found out, that for majority MT4 of platforms, in indicator BAT ATR , parameters are comprehensible: 1) 3 and 2 false or true; 2) 5 and 3,4 false or 5 and 3.7 false. The principle of work of the indicator will not change. Blue or Red line draw

We have tested this system on Alpari server (you can change every parameter as you wish) and still using it with no hassle at all in our trading decisions. We don't know about other MT4 platforms regarding BAT system. Thanks for your feedback.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
I'm thinking along the same lines as you for a filter.I have a 72EMA on my chart .If trade is against the trend, I'm waiting for price to close 10 pips past the Bat line and then waiting for price to move past this closing price on the next candle. This seems to eliminate a lot of bad trades if you go back and look at 2006.Teamaphid, could you help me decide if my filter would produce better results? Thanks

--- 帖子 #422 ---
It may eliminate some bad trades, but due to lagging nature of moving averages, until you get information in regard to trend direction, you will enter the winning trades late which will cost many pips. Look at one of the recent winning trades on GBPUSD, the one short @ 1.9709 on January 3rd, 2007, at 08:00hr (Alpari server time). If you use 72 EMA to filter, your entry would be at 12:00hr from 1.9594, 115 pips difference due to lagging nature of EMA. Therefore, you need to do a proper testing to see if eliminating bad trades compensates the late entry cost and your filter produces better results.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Team! What to me is better for choosing traling stop at tenders GBP/USD? What traling stop you specify at tenders GBP/USD for BAT ATR ?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Here's a simple EA I wrote that will handle moving SL's and closing pending orders for the BAT strategy. Simply place your order as normal, set your pending orders and activate this EA. It will move the SL's according to the ATR lines and also close pending orders once the ATR line has gone above/below the order. Saves a lot of time and lets you get some sleep Lux

What do you mean by tenders? If you are asking what kind of stop loss we are using for this system, we can say only BAT lines, blue for long trades and red for short trades.

Excuse me for my bad English speech. I badly speak on English. I have understood so , what you are guided only by crossing of lines BAT and on these signals of crossing put stop loss?

--- 帖子 #429 ---
That is OK with your English...you are trying and this is good. We use the BAT line as a stop loss once the trade is in progress. The initial or starting stop loss at the begining of a trade is different and it is explained in the PDF, it is 10 pips below or above the swing. Does this make it clear for you? See the chart...the current stop loss is placed 9603. (Sorry I do not have the fib lines drawn as I am testing something.)

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Do You can after the schedule resulted by you how on an example, to draw where there should be an input, what such these 10 pips what stop loss should be initial how stop loss moves in relation to the price or it moves equally dark blue line BAT ? And in what situation it is necessary to close order ? May be you in Russian speak?

[quote=TeamAphid;218499] In PDF you write as to do an input (on lines Fibo a level 1 = Enter 1 lot ) in the market. Precisely to speak, if the schedule of the price has crossed (in time-frames H1 ) for example, red line BAT on 3-4 pips can be opened that order. But! There are moments when bar has crossed a red line, and next hour has returned back and in general has gone to the opposite party, below a level 1 = Enter 1 lot . How to be insured in that case? What input in the market should be the most correct?

Yes, price hit the red BAT line and you opened a long position with 1 lot. Then if price retraces as in your case, you are going to take 1 more lot at 61.8 fib. level and if price continues its retracement, you will open 2 more long positions at 38.2 fib.level and if price hits opposite blue BAT line, you'll exit all open positions and reverse your position by being 1 lot short this time. There is no assurance that price will not retrace and if you are asking a filter for bad trades, this is the reason we are sharing this system with valuable members of FF, all of us are looking for a better exit signal to improve profitability.

I would like to share my simple filter to avoid bad signal with this BAT strategy that I found very lucrative (thanks again to the teame). The simple indicator that I'm using so succefully with all pairs (usualy €$, £$, $JPY, £JPY, $CHF ) is the GMMA (Guppy Multiple Moving Average)well know by many FF members becouse many 3d have been writen and readen on it. For take profit I use, with the right weight of experience, the multiple RSI with add-on MA. Up to now it fail only yesterday with Cable because the new (and becouse of that I was out of trade); I mean that according to GMMA the yesterday short signal was false but the news push the price against the BAT line. Of course this are discretionary sistem and signal are coming with expierience and not with dot light open and, of course, this is my view and opinion. I hope this can help Laoma

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi Team, First of all thank you for sharing this great system! Have you came to the conclusion that trading the BAT on other currencies besides the ones you already mentioned is unprofitable? I ask because backtesting a bit it seems that you can also get a good amount of pips from pairs like EURJPY or GBPCHF

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Following my previous post I annex herewith the different view of same pair. You can see in the first one indicated as "Bat" that the price went upper than line and that was signal to open a position. The second image show that the time is too early and the price find resistence to grow and it start to retrace. I' know that it is too early to say, if price retrace we have to buy more at 68 and 38 % and wait until it will go again at the first entrance level and have there the first profit but this will keep open the possibility of false signal (the worst is that you open position at 68 and 38 and than price keep to retrace and go to touch again the opposite BAT line). In my opinion, to be out of this risky false signals, I will wait better set up with GMMA Hope that is helpfull for someone and clear too. Laoma

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Laoma, Could you give us more clues about your GMMA and how to analyze it. Attached Image This is the previous trade, using break of the "crossing bar" (touch &amp; cross BAT line), and wait for 10 pips from BAT line, which in this case, we open at 1.9540 We also look for EMA55 slope, the oscillator below is magnifier for visual guide, it is the difference between EMA55 current value from previous value, we can see it is both positive (&gt;0) and raising, so it says signal is valid. Attached Image This is the current trade (for higher res, look for zip file), we could just ignore our filters and go back to the original system when price action happened before BAT signal. As in this case, break of price channel for the last 17 hours, maybe price wait for something happened, which it proves, and we get our short signal when price breaks our support @9604, so when BAT give us another short signal, it is no longer need our filter. Hope this helps.

We backtested EURJPY and did not like the results, therefore we are not trading that currency. We also backtested USDCAD, USDJPY and USDCHF and their results are much better than EURJPY, and if you are after modest income, they are tradable, too.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Loama, can you please explain step-by-step how you use GMMA and multiple RSI with add-on MA (together with indicator values) for filtering and taking profits so that we can test your ideas? Thanks for contributing.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Dear traders, Idea BAT Team's it is very perfect for GBP/USD and EUR/USD and I think it is not necessary to invent "bicycles". For example yesterday trade on EUR/USD : I thought that the Dollar can besiege Euro and slide downwards, and dark blue line BAT had to the given tendency, BUT! It has not occured also I it has seen owing to this indicator and lines Fibo , that is I have seen recoil back in favour of rise of Euro. As I have seen it, and is very simple. I needed patience at 2 o'clock and a close review of dynamics of struggle of Euro and Dollar in this time interval. I remember the description of work of the indicator, I look at 2 following bars after crossing a dark blue line. And at last I see not activity of movement downwards the first bar after crossing and return of the second bar back above a dark blue line. All! This signal speaks about impossibility of a short position. It is necessary to wait. But! It is result which insures me against losses. If so it would be desirable to trade nevertheless on small quantity pips then change parameters BAT on 3 and 2 false and trade up to a level 1,618. On such parameters the level 1,618 will be ALWAYS reached. These conclusions are made of mine Careful supervision. Thanks for attention.

Hi Team Aphid, I have been playing around with some ideas. My aim is to try and screen your entries so that basically only entries in the direction of the trend are taken. Let us analise the GBP from the 07/02 onwards. From the chart three lower highs were made. I included a long period stochastic of 34 periods. Notice with High 1 the stochastic never left the oversold region while with High 2 &amp; 3 it stopped at the 50 level. With the High 2 a buy signal was given, but what followed was a bearish engulfing candle and the stochastic stalled at 50. I have also included some simple trendlines. I think that with keeping your charts simple and adding lagging indicators, and being able to interpret what the charts are telling you , your losses can be minimised. The long position from High 2 should have been closed out after the bearish engulfing candle , with a small loss. Unfortunately we will not know if we have a situation where the trend continues. I have not looked at a ranging market. But sofar my line of thought is that if we have a trend in place and we are making higher highs or lower lows, is it wise to trade against the trend

Team Aphid... i have been trading for just over 2 years. It has been a struggle. Thank you for sharing your method... i have tried so many approaches. i am using nothing but BAT now and this is the first time i have ever been consistently adding to my account. You folks are the greatest!

I agree this method put my account raising too.:surprised Thanks for your sharing, please continue to support us.

Sorry but I think I'm not intitle to recieve your "thanks" and in the same way I can't explain step by step how to use GMMA and multiple RSI just becouse every things I know is coming 90 % from FF and in this forum you can find all links and answer. My way of trading is just to apply what I understaind from my reading and studing and, I'm sure, yours are well in front of my knowledge. As shortcut I annex here some documents and link to others topics of FF where you can find discussions about it. for RSI " http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=787 " and this for GMMA " http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...highlight=gmma " I hope this can help Laoma

With parameter settings ATR period 3 and Factor 2, you'll get more signals, more whipsaws with less stoploss levels, but if you are after small gains like 161.8, then you are right, it is more reachable with these settings. Therefore, you can use BAT system for scalping, range trading and trend trading purposes with appropriate risk management measures.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
If you have a trend following mechanical system like BAT, it is not wise to trade against trend. But, again, the problem is how you determine the trend. On your chart, you see high 2 and high 3 after the event, by the time you see it, you get BAT long signals, as you indicated. And it seems you are using Stoch. indicator rather than higher high/lower low trend indicator in your entry decisions such as when you get a buy signal from BAT, then check out Stoch level and if it is above 50 level, then buy, otherwise pass the signal and if it is below 50 when you get a sell signal from BAT, then sell. It may work and filter out some losing trades, but it should be backtested properly. We would like to remind everyone that a better exit strategy is still needed not to leave too many hard-earned pips on the table. That's what we are focusing as a team as well. Thanks for your contribution.

Thanks for sharing below attachments. We'll go through them. But just a quick note for you; there are many ways people can use the same indicator. That's why we asked you to explain your way of using these together with BAT so that maybe we can modify original BAT system by using your rules to have better results. Anyway, thank you for your kind words and contributions.

Hello, TA. I have posted a collection of small charts that i use to keep track of volatility for all currency pairs. The 8 contained in this collection are the most volatile over a 30 hour period and are arranged in order of volatility. In that group is EURJPY which has not backtested well for you. Also, GBPCHF which you have not tested yet. Do you have any plans to back test it? I would be happy to do some grunt work for us all here but i am not as experienced so might need some guidance. Are there any others among this group that is on your hit list to test?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Gandolf, could you please upload your ATR indicator? It's easier to monitor than the one provided in MT4. thanks

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Someone else's idea that i have adopted as a mechanical exercise is updating support and resistance levels as follows. - High and Low from last year and this year - High and Low from last month and this month - High and Low from last week and this week - High and Low for prior trading day - Psych levels at even 100 pip levels - Oh, yeh... and also take note of the multiple time frame 20, 50, 100 and 200 Daily SMAs What i am wondering is if it would be appropriate to exit when - we pass the 423.6 Fib level - price reverses at one of these major S/R levels - moves away at a certain velocity - and moves a certain distance I rode GBPJPY all the way from the entry, down past the 423.6 Fib level, and back up to the BAT trailing stop. It reversed as it approached the 232 psych level. Would have been nice to have saved a portion of that 146 pips before my exit. For now, i'll give up the 146, but if TA thinks this could work I'd be happy to do the work to backtest this if someone can help with parameters.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
We have tested 5 out of 8 currencies on your list except GBPCHF, AUDNZD and EURCAD. Since we are working on a few projects at the moment including improvement of BAT by using different exit strategies, we have no plans to backtest those three pairs with original rules. But we are more than happy to guide you if you do backtests yourself.

Hey, Richy. Here it is. PM me if you have questions about how to set it up.

We think you are using a different server than Alpari according to the chart you attached. We sold @236.34 and still holding the trade with 300 pips profit and price has not hit Red BAT line yet, and red BAT line sits @ 233.6380 (rounded up to 233.64) where we will close our short position and get long with one lot.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Using FXDD. If i am going to backtest with your guidance, do i need to work from the Alpari data, or will FXDD be close enough? Based on my FXDD charts i took a 300 pip profit and am now long in GBPJPY. What about the 423.6 Fib level / major S/R level idea?

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi nTeam A, please ahve a look the attached chart. I have included a Fractal indicator to help determine the different swing points. Once a new trade is triggered, would you uses Swing low A or B to draw the fib extensions. If I recall correctly you said the most recent low, which would be Swing low A . The same applies to the low at 14 Feb and 13 Feb. The correct low would be 14 Feb Regards Eckbert

--- 帖子 #467 ---
All your thoughts, exits and filters may have a potential, but there is only one way to understand if they are tradable, backtesting. Therefore, you need to choose an exit strategy and start backtesting. Knowing the system better, gaining more confidence and having faith in the system; we believe that all will be obtained by backtesting. We are ready to support you with all the help you need.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
For backtesting questions, please use PM to keep main thread focused for other contributers. Then, if we end up with a tradable result after backtesting, we can use main thread to open a discussion and get the ideas of other FF members.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Yes, you need to use Alpari server since all our tests are based on that server and we can compare the results.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
For the most recent GBPUSD long trade, we are using Feb 16 15:00 bar's low to draw fib. retracements. For Feb 13/14 lows, we used Feb 13 12:00 bar's low. If you want to give more room to a trade and have larger stoploss, then you may choose above swing lows. But if you cannot risk that much stoploss or if you are conservative, then you may choose Feb 14 01:00 and Feb 16 22:00 bars as swing lows, but in our opinion, they are not significant. We prefer most recent low/high to be significant.

I add distance variable, for BAT line to be more flexible, it can be used to ignore spike. If you're doing manual trade, you can put both into chart, I am using it to filter invalid signal which are : 1. Spike bar that crosses BAT line with its high/low is still in distance (11 pips) 2. Next bar after crossing bar cannot break high/low Valid signal is if "crossing bar" break BAT line within distance and next bars beyond distance. Attached Image

I think it would be a good idea if someone could make the BAT indicator to show the value of the BAT line for the current bar as well as the value of the BAT line for the last completed bar (maybe on the upper left corner?) It would save a lot of time! I would do it myself if I knew how to...

--- 帖子 #474 ---
What you are doing is actually something very similar to change Factor parameter in original BAT indicator. Please have a look at GBPJPY chart. Change distance parameter to 1.0 and keep ATR Period @ 5 and Factor @ 4.0 Then, in original BAT indicator, keep ATR period @ 5, but change Factor to 4.6. You'll see what we mean. The result will be less noise, bigger stoplosses. Thanks for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
has anyone tried this, treat each trade equally in terms of success probability. That is, first calculate number of pips needed for SL, and adjust the position size so that the risk for that trade is x%. For instance, let say we enter 1 lot for a position of SL of 50 pips. Then if a trade is supposed to have a SL of 100 pips, we bet only 0.5 lots.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
[quote=mason;222168]I took a little quick visual backtest and fix a little bug. On the schedule 2 indicators are resulted: BAT ATR v1 and BAT ATR Distance ( last version which the author has corrected from a mistake ) BUT! The mistake of new indicator BAT ATR Distance Is observed EUR/USD concerns the remote indicator (11 pips ) with a thorn and departs back, BUT! The indicator reacts (instead of ignores a thorn) and starts to draw from below a dark blue line. The arrow of white color specifies the new corrected indicator. The previous indicator (first version BAT ATR Distance ) was more correct. It ignored a contact of thorns and reacted only to the price of the closed position bar's. I do not understand for what you have altered it. The new indicator badly works, return please old version BAT ATR Distance

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I have been looking into alternative exits for trade 1. One method that I use with another strategy is to tighten the stop (reduce ATR multiple) after hitting an initial profit target. Average profit on trade 1 is 111 pips, so tighten after say 200 pips. However, this just gets you out of the trend too early. Looking at this, even the 4ATR stop gets out of the trending market too early in many cases (e.g. look at trades at end April-May). The strategy keeps reversing &amp; taking losing trades against the trend. So I looked at widening the stop to 6 ATR after a gain of 200 pips (This would keep you in the end April trade until 8580, current exit 8215). This helped in some cases, and might be worth checking this out on an EA to optimise the 200 pip trigger &amp; the 6ATR to see if there is a better combination. I think you might get a better result by leaving more pips on the table! However, this analysis did trigger another thought. A big gain suggests that we have a trending market. Why not skip the contra-trend trade after a big gain? This did seem to improve the results overall. Considering trade 1 only (I didn't check limit orders), this approach would skip 14 trades, 9 of them losers &amp; improve the overall reult by 219 pips (7% improvement for trade 1).

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Thank you for different ideas. We devoted too much of our time to filter out some of the losing trades especially by trying different set of parameters, and we concluded that Atr period 5 with factor 4 is the best combination for our risk profile. Regarding your assumption for trending markets, check out GBPJPY chart. It was on a clear uptrend since April 2006 and it may even continue despite recent pullback. Now, look at the short signal on Jan 3rd, 2007. It was a counter trend signal and it was triggered after a good gain (103 pips). So, if you pass this short signal, you'll miss 455 pips. The weakness of this strategy is that you may miss big pips during trend reversal and large retracement times. Thanks for your contributions.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I might not have explained myself clearly. I agree that ATR factor 4 is best overall. However, I was proposing to change it only after a threshold is reached (say 200 pips gain). This way, you keep the initial risk the same, but give the market more room when trending (see chart below). In a similar way, you would only avoid the contra trend trade after a large (say 200 pip) gain. As a result, the proposed change would have taken the short signal on 3 Jan. I only looked at this on GBPUSD, so don't know if the same rule / threshold would improve the results on GBPJPY. If you have a spreadsheet on GBPJPY, I could check this fairly quickly.

I backtested it for the BAT with different scenarios, but only for January to end of July 2006. Send me a PM if you are interested.

I must say all credits goes to TeamAphid, this method really change how mechanic we can be in order to balance discretionary decisions. I didn't explore the settings yet, I am sure it is similar, but the concept of adding instead of multiplying is simpler, I guess. Perhaps we have "updated curve fitting" value for distance, instead of ATRPeriod and Factor. Only backtest could prove it, no over optimization is what I am hoping too. I take a sample chart for better visualization in our head. Attached Image

[quote=Anderwill;222459] I am sorry, I still believe what I did for last version is right, I believe the first version is double-add, and I have replaced it, if you can take a cleaner chart with no-resize resolution, may be I can figure it out what exactly you want. Thanks for mentioning, we need every possible efforts to make this indicator better.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hello, I tried to improve the system by reducing it to 1 lot only, without using fibonacci retracements to add to the initial position. This way, you only look for big moves in the direction of your entry. Then I searched for those moves (mostly 200 pips or more maximum favorable excursion [MFE] since entry without touching Bat ATR in the meantime) and observed the maximum adverse excursion (MAE) since entry. I did this manually for both 2005 and 2006. Next I calculated how large an initial stop was needed to keep you in 3/4 of those trades or at least in 1/2 of those trades (quartile 3 and 2). If you use a smaller intitial stop, whipsaws hurt you much less, and you can increase the position size while keeping account risk the same as before. Maybe someone could do an automatic backtest wether this helps on overall profitability.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Bounty, Thanks for result, questions : 1. what is the pair ? 2. Are those trades win only ? 3. is MAE a BAT line to BAT line pips ? 4. is MFE a BAT line to maximum pips ? 5. is Quartile3 &amp; 4 a minimum SL ? do you use fibo swing point as SL ?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
You have explained yourself clearly, no problem there. We were considering next entry strategy when saying ATR factor 4 is the best, sorry not being clear here. If you use, say ATR factor 6 to give the trade more room and exit trade #1, what will be your entry strategy for next trade as BAT always keeps you in position? If you use ATR factor 6 again for next trade entry (say it is not a counter trend entry), it may be late as entry signal will already be triggered by ATR factor 4. Please see post # 263 for GBPJPY spreadsheet. Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
The strange schedule. (Look attach). Yesterday and today I look as on GBP/USD GBP in the beginning does a thorn upwards punching a level "1" and coming back. Then at night again attempt to punch "1", the first bar punches level Enter 1 lot , the second bar probably rests against resistance, the third bar returns again back. Indicator BAT ATR during unsuccessful attempt of breakdown of a level "1" (it Enter 1 lot ) draws a dark blue line as a trend, at that that the red line is not punched. Look the attached chart. I have paid attention that at attempt to pass a level "1", the price has rested against key level Fibo 1,236. On a scale I have designated it conditionally Level for Start. This level, also has shown 1,236 me that the price could not go above up to 1,618. Here such supervision. ПИЗДЕЦ КОРОЧЕ! недотянул график до контрольной 1,618

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hello Mason, 1. The pair is GBP/USD 2. Yes, losing trades have been skipped in the spreadsheet. My intention was to optimize the initial stop loss width by determining how small it can be set without stopping you out of more then 1/4 or 1/2 of the relevant winning trades. Since there's no harm to be stopped out of a losing trade, I disregarded losing trades in my calculation. 3. MAE is a statistical number for each trade. It tells you how much the trade went against you after your entry. 4. MFE is a statistical number for each trade. It tells you how much the trade went in your favor after your entry. 5. I didn't use any fibo swing points at all. Quartile 3 for a group of numbers tells you at which number 3/4 of the group are smaller than the resulting number. For me, all favorable trades' MAEs were the group of numbers, and Quartile 3 of that group tells me how small I can set the stop without being stopped out more than 1 out of 4 times for those favorable trades.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Thanks for explanation, any conclusion on how we should put SL and TP, such as if swing is less than 57 pips from BAT line, we stick to 57 pips. Or our RRR should be around 1 : 10, because average of MAE : MFE is 32.75 and 324.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hello Mason, I ought to add that the MFE numbers might be misleading, they only tell you in hindsight how much profit a trade might have generated. Caculating the average number for MAE values can be dangerous since it doesn't necessarily tell you how often the average will be hit: Average numbers can be skewed by outliers, so I better like to work with quartiles (there's an excel function for that, as you can see from my spreadsheet). You might want to calculate the quartile 1 from all MFEs of the big winning trades. The resulting number tells you which target would have been hit by 3 out of 4 big moves. However, I only tried to find a reasonable way to minimize the initial stop, while I didn't intend to optimize take profit exits. You have to keep in mind that my spreadsheet omits all the losers, break-even trades and minor winners. I don't know if you could achieve a hit ratio better than 10% for all trades, which you would need to be profitable with 1:10 RRR. That would be an interesting study though. This way, you could use the bat ATR line for entry only, and attach bracket orders (stop loss, take profit) based on your statistical observations for the exit without having to monitor the trade. For my own forward test I decided to use an initial stop of 40 pips. That should keep me in more than 1/2 of all major moves.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
I have taken a look at GBPJPY. Both suggestions (higher ATR &amp; skip trades after big win) produce significantly worse results for GBPJPY. I think I was guilty of curve fitting for GBPUSD only..... I think it is going to be difficult to improve the exit for trade 1 - any change will either limit the gains, or impact on the next trade.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi James, No problem with using price action as an exit. We just need to create a mathematical rule or something to make sure that we treat every scenario exactly the same. If we don’t do that then we are not treating this as a mechanical trading system. We’ll try to describe the pin bar in math terms. Some of the “magic” might get lost because we will not be able to bring in pivot areas, trend lines and the other tools that the “chart gazers” use but let’s see how it works out. Thanks

--- 帖子 #495 ---
yeah i dont want to muddy up the waters. for team aphids sake and the mechanical nature of the system i dont want my stuff becoming a topic of discussion here. your description is why. when you combine my stuff it is no longer totally mechanical at least as far as entries. everyone who is following this mechanical system should continue to do just that and not start altering it. for those that understand my stuff its certainly possible to refine a few areas but once again when you do that its not the BAT in its true form anymore. as i said all im personally doing is demoing the system and using price action to help refine or determine entries and exits. another words im just playing around and researching. since i know team aphid and have had access to the complete system for some time i know how good it is. good enough to take it thru my normal testing and refining stages which can sometimes take up to a year before i risk real money. i have enjoyed it a great deal and i value and enjoy my relationship with the team members. some of which i have known now for a couple of years since the very early months of forex factories creation. where does the time go?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I can't believe the master is here, it is an honour. It comes to me when I saw many charts, especially cleaner ones, I saw another tool such as resistance, support and flip of res/supp line could become early warning/confirmation. (yes, you know where it comes from) I also believe EA can help this, with more focus, enhancement and correct setting, we can have more robust strategy in an already very strong method. Off course we have to monitor always the chart and EA, but we could put an early warning EA before the EA really takes an action. I don't want to talk about EA in this thread, but since our goal is to be mechanical, it is not a bad idea to have an assistance such as EA, but not to be confused as a reason if the method is profitable or not. EA is just as dumb as rock. (not to mean harsh)

Here is an unfinished indicator to detect price ranging, I think this could be useful if price break the range against BAT signal. I hope someone could finish it to be better, in the mean time, we can find reliable setting as usual. I am thinking of drawing rectangle object and placing price label at resistance and support, instead of as an oscillator. Duty calls, whoever interested. Rules : if more than 4 bars in histogram, price did range, we find highest high and lowest low and draw rectangle. This indicator is also based on MA, it has been a very powerful in most of the time.

Hi all Thank you for your great system. I trade almost a year and I find your system very comfortable . I thought abaout whipsaw filter : all the rules as you wrote except entry must be the first candle that his open price is above/under the bat line. what do you think about it? Simon

--- 帖子 #500 ---
You can filter out some of losing trades by using your entry filter, but, on the other hand, you will sacrifice some pips due to late entry. Therefore, we recommend you to do a proper backtest to make a comparison.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Team Aphid, I would appreciate some clarification on the situation that happened today: Today on GBPUSD, price broke the blue BAT line at 9596, stopping out the long trade for a profit &amp; giving short entries which were promptly stopped out at 9671 (maybe my stop should have been a few pips higher). The red BAT line has now appeared at 9674. However, if price fails to break the red line, would you re-enter short at the retracement points and/or at the previous entry? Thanks

--- 帖子 #502 ---
After short entry @ 9596, we were stoppped out @ 9659 (26/2 09:00 bar)(recent high to draw fib. retracements) + 10 pips = 9669, and then we are long from 9672 (red line appeared @ 1.967120, so we rounded it up to 9672) with a SL @ 9591 - 10 pips = 9581. When red BAT line is @ 1.967120, we put a pending limit order @ 9672 + spread for Stop and Reverse position. If you are not long, we would enter long instead of short at any price below 9672 so that you will have narrower SL if price falls and bigger profit potential if GBPUSD climbs up.

Correct me if I'm wrong. Does the trade entries must be in "pending limits" order? What if the price (on the 1st trade) just touched or penetrate through the ATR line but didn't went back to the line, does it mean a "no trade"? Why is there number "3 &amp; 4" trade, isn't it suppose to be just number 3 trade since it's only a single position?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
hi TA, now that I am trading BAT on a live account it happended / I saw that the S/L was following the BAT-line as it was supposed to. This S/L, however, was hit before the price moved into the intended direction again (bounced exactly off the BAT line!) but as said, I was taken out of the market. Maybe you could check that and maybe we can always put the S/L a few pips beyond the line.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Yes, we use pending limit orders and add spread for "BUY" orders because MT4 shows bid prices. Have a look at GBPUSD chart on Alpari server. SL for the short position from 12/3 13:00 bar was at 1.934960 (we round it up to 1.9350) (for "BUY" orders, we round it up and for "SELL" orders, we round it down) at 13/3 14:00 bar. When the price hit 1.9350, we were stopped out and took long position. Therefore, we put our pending limit orders just above/below ATR line depending LONG/SHORT positions. Re. trade numbers, original system trades 4 lots and trade # 3 and 4 are the ones we take when price hits 38.2% fibo level. Trade # 2 is the single one we take when price hits 61.8% fibo level.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Please see our previous post regarding placing orders. It is totally a coincidence that the price bounced exactly off the BAT line. If you feel more comfortable, you can add/subtract some certain pips to BAT line for taking trades. We are using 10 pips for SL if BAT line is way below the recent high/low (where you draw the fibo).

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi all. I`m in long trade! GBP/USD 1.9343 Is it right? Thanx.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
We are long from 1.9334 + spread, it may be mt4 server difference.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
hello team i would like to know if the bat line is above the swing line and i move the SL to the bat line, shuold i move also the swing line? please see the exampls for what i mean below. Thank you for your efforts simon

--- 帖子 #522 ---
i have read it, and my test shows that the SL used now is too detrimental.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
if u guys need to backtest the BAT atr in Mt4, i created an ea that allows u to trade live ...in the past. It works by using global variable. just start the Test with visual mode enabled, drop the BAT atr on the chart. Press F3 to goto global variables. in entry, use 1 for long and 2 for short. close window when u want to exit, press pause, press F3 to see variables and use place a '1' in the exit field. it feels as if u executing orders yourself

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Still in Trade. Currently +5 pips.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
If the BAT line is above the swing line, your SL will be the BAT line. We use swing low/high -10/+10 pips for SL when BAT line is under the swing line. When you move SL with BAT line, you shouldn't move your swing line no matter where your BAT line is. Because after determining the initial stop (swing low/high -10/+10 pips), swing line serves to draw fibo levels for range trading and those fibo levels are fixed, not moving with BAT line.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Still in trade with SL at 1.9326, just 8 pips of risk.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Team Aphid, Do you trade this strategy with fixed lots (as described) or with fixed risk per position? I think that the results are improved by applying a fixed risk per trade (or fixed percentage of account) &amp; adjusting the lot size. I just wondered if you had considered this? Thanks

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Yeah! Excellent TeamAphid! I`ve got +120 pips, my first try with Bat method. In my opinion this method is profitable also for USD/JPY. Let me tell ya, u guys are doin a great job, keep it up. Thanx.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
We trade fixed lots, but we use a money management technique to determine the lot size depending on our account balance.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
could a diagram explain this? plz? i think i get what u are saying but nt 100% sure

--- 帖子 #531 ---
ONCE entered, the bat can be used as a trailing stop. For the more conservative trader, u could add another BAT to the chart but this time use different colors and use a setting of 2x2 instead. Just a sugestion http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u...1/battrail.gif

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Please have a look at the charts #2,3, and 4 on pdf document explaining the strategy (post #35).

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Sorry I couldn't find the answer to this question, but if you have a trigger for a short (hits blue bat line) and then the price zooms up and hits a trigger for a long (hits red line) do you close your previous short (don't wait to hit stoploss) and immediately open a long? Please look at the recent chart of the GBPJPY for an example of this. Thanks

--- 帖子 #534 ---
yes chantspel, close and reverse on each touch of the opposite batline. its in the PDF

We have tried other time frames, we still believe 1H is the optimum one.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
TA, can i just ask that you keep monitoring this thread and helping out. I feel that it seems to be slowing down here, and i realise that as yet we dont seem to have any refinement of the original system, unless i have missed something. i really like the mechanical simplicity of this, and the fact it works in both ranging and trending markets, but the stop and targets still need tweaking, but i cant for the life of me work out whats best. i would just hate the think that if this thread starts to get bumped further down the first page due to lack of posting, that we would lose your input. thanks

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Here are my tweaked indicators, hope TA don't mind, also MTF is from Heiken Ashi Smoothed Thread. Now let's find the more appropriate settings. I use 3 ATR for more reactive and 3 Factor for less far away, Median price for objectiveness (instead of close) and Close price to avoid spike (instead of High/Low).

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Thanks for your contribution. Your modified ATR looks promising, we'll test it properly. Btw, can you please explain how you use 4 TF HAS BAT indicator in relation to BAT ATR?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi Rockrat We keep monitoring this thread and helping where we can and yes it might be slowing down but this is not a bad thing ( gives us time to test things). There is no refinement yet so you have not missed anything. We are still working away on ideas and hope that there might be an answer to this puzzle. We have a quick look and eyeball on each and every suggestion that has been put forward...some we dismiss straightaway as we have tried it or else it is too discretionary. The ideas that are new, we will try out, we really do appreciate the contributions that members make. One thing that does perhaps frustrate us a bit is that it takes us a lot of time to test all these ideas as we still prefer to perform our testing manually. There is a process....we have to firstly understand what the suggestion is and how to trade it and be given an example. (Suggestions made to us without any guidelines from the originator are sometimes quite useless...ppl look at indicators in various ways.) Then we run a sample test on our worst performing month in original BAT rules and then another test sample on the best performing month in original BAT rules...put this together and if the results are an overall improvement then do a more comprehensive test. This comprehensive test is then audited by another team member hence the process really takes quite some time. We feel this system is worth working on and so we will persevere. An example is the post by Mason with his suggestion...we will give it serious eyeball testing and then start the process. You never know.... Cheers Athena

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi Mason, Can you please explain how do you use the posted indicators, especially the MTF? Thanks, Pip

--- 帖子 #546 ---
On the attached chart you can see an USDJPY chart with some trading signals. What can be done to avoid this kind of situation? (difficult question...) It seems that Bat system is a very good profit generator when the market is trending, but in some situations were the trend is not established we can face some difficulties. What do you think? Many thanks. Good trades! Pip

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I was in hurry posting last post, here are 3 indicators. I am unable to edit it, so ignore my previous post. MTF is multi-timeframe, so you need to input TimeFrame variable : PERIOD_M1 1 PERIOD_M5 5 PERIOD_M15 15 PERIOD_M30 30 PERIOD_H1 60 PERIOD_H4 240 PERIOD_D1 1440 PERIOD_W1 10080 PERIOD_MN1 43200 You can put as many MTF BAT ATR v2 indicator as you want, but make sure you put different colors and line widths for easy reading. I try HAS method for better entry and to avoid whipsaw, and use BAT for stoploss, but in order to decide whether price really breakout or already move enough, we need to see price in relation to those BAT MTF lines, it will need a lot of screen time to find pattern. Alternatively we can build EA that is adjustable to accomodate what we are looking in the chart, we can have more statisctic then. Be ware of news, I have seen it break all MTF BAT lines just to whipsaw. Since I am combining with HAS, my TF is M5, 4 TF BAT indicator show next 4 higher TF and red square means BAT line resistance still exist, blue means BAT line support still exist. I like 3 ATR, 3 Factor, Median Price and Close crossing, we will need more tester to find suitable setting for each TF and each pair, or another tweak maybe, or another idea for news, because sometimes news helps BAT, that's why we need more statistic.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thanks Mason for your ideas. Firstly we are rather reluctant to take news into consideration with this being too discretionary for our mechanical ways. After placing the indicators on the chart it is still unclear and confusing to us exactly what our first point of reference is to be when taking a trade. We are perhaps not seeing what it is that you are seeing. Having someone do an EA for this is feasible but you will need to have more definite entry and exit points mapped out for your trade plan. I suggest you ask over at the BAT EA thread. They are a very helpful group of members. If you could post a chart with your indicators and show the entry point and what conditions need to be met with the HAS etc then we might gain some more understanding. As mentioned previously it is essential to do a scientific comparison when adding an indicator or making a change. We need to compare the modified version with the original and note the difference but there also needs to be 100% mechanics involved. Thanks for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Nothing can really be done to avoid losses. Bat does make good pips in a trend but it also makes pips when the market is in a range period. This is one of the unique qualities of this system. Cheers

--- 帖子 #550 ---
First of all, I'd like to thank TA about this method. Did some manual back-testing as far as 9 months. Looks good, and I'm quite comfortable at 4hr setting. Anyway, I've gone through like 15 pages of this thread but didnt see anything that relates to how this method is developed. Can someone explain to me the math/logic behind BAT? I'm sorry I still cannot read programming language. So, if someone care to explain what TA did in the code with plain english, I would appreciate that. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi Have a look at post #350 in this thread. Enjoy

--- 帖子 #552 ---
You're welcome TA, you have given us wonderful method with sound concept here. I am still learning HAS, so I can't comment yet, but this MTF BAT with 4 TF BAT as dashboard, you can have warning signal when price cross lower-TF BAT lines, such as M30,M15 or even M5 TF. This should warn us that if price is going to break. I put 4 times MTF BAT indicators which mirror 4 TF BAT indicators, I haven't put enough time to do mechanical backtest, but as rule of thumb, if higher TF is putting long bias and lower TF just come back from short to long, it should be a good entry, especially during London session, and we should watch for flat days which are before big news. Indicators and EAs are tools, they need to tweaked from time to time, how far the tweak is, depends on how we think and visually see the pattern, it's really a long customized, transparent, background-experience oriented and continuous process, which is very hard to do it in simple mechanical way, but mechanical is a great way to contribute statistic.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Team Aphid, Can you clarify how you handle this situation. The last GBPUSD long at 9681 (plus 38% &amp; 62% entries) was stopped out when the swing low was taken out around 9600. However, a short position was not triggered. Did you re-enter 38% &amp; 62% positions when price rallied (even if the original ones were stopped out) &amp; did you re-enter a long swing position (even though there is no long BAT entry line? Thanks

--- 帖子 #554 ---
You are right, we were stopped out at 9601 (9611 swing low minus 10 pips) and short position was not triggered since the price did not hit blue BAT line. There are two ways to handle this situation. You can either do nothing and wait for the next short signal, or you can re-enter 2 units when price hits 38.2%, 1 unit at 61.8% and 1 or 2 units (depending on your trade size of this system, 4 or 5 as explained before) at 100% fib.level and trail your position with blue BAT line. We prefer second option not to miss a move.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Sorry about all the questions. I'm just trying to understand your interpretation of the strategy, so that I can match your results more closely. There was a long position triggered on GBPJPY today around 230.50. What did you use as the swing low for your stop loss &amp; fib calculations? There were minor lows at 229.86, 229.09 &amp; a more significant low at 228.76. Thanks

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Don't be sorry, you can ask as many questions as you like, we are here to help. We have used 228.76 as a significant swing low to determine SL and fibo levels.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
hello TeamAphid! I've a similiar method that backtests great for year 2004,2005 and 2006. however 2003 was a losing year. the beginning of 2003 was very good, but from October 2003 to January 2004 the system lost all its profits plus half of my starting equity. looking at the chart you can see that there was a very nice long uptrend from Oct.2003 to Jan.2004. yet my trend following system failed miserably in this nice long trend. I wonder how does your system fare in that same period. do you perhaps have the backtesting result for that particular year?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
We don't have the backtesting result for that period and we can't see that period on 1H chart on mt4 platform (we can see until July 12th, 2004) so we cannot backtest that period now. Sorry, we can't help.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
hi TA, do we have any official suggested/updated rules for the system?

--- 帖子 #573 ---
i too lost in 2003. use my visual backtester to see it in action live and emotional. just attach bat to the chart while ea is running and use global variables for trading it (press f3)

--- 帖子 #574 ---
TeamAphid, thanks for your speedy reply. how are your results on GBPUSD for the 1st quarter? my system lost out big on this pair, I wonder how you guys are doing. best regards

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Our result on GBPUSD for the 1st quarter is -1,104 pips with 4 lot version. So, total of +2,278 pips (GBPUSD + GBPJPY) for 3 months.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Boy, i tell u. this strategy is awesome. I have been trading this strategy live for about a week, and I am already up 6% in my account!!!!! Team aphid, give me your address. I need to send you some gift cards I am very grateful for this.

We hope you have the same opinion during drawdown times, lol. There are many profitable strategies on this forum, the problem is to use them with discipline, and taking every trade mechanically. Good luck in your trading. Thanks for the compliments.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Yes, tahts true. I am ready for the drawdowns too, I trade with a very good money management system in place, and I am very comfortable with 15-20% drawdown. I just accept it as a fact of life. But you are very right about discipline. its very essential.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Team Aphid, I guess this question is not just for you but all veteran traders. When do u stop trading a strategy? lets say I use this bat or any other strategy for few months/years, and at sometime, it goes donwn 20%....or 25 or whatever....but how do u decide that a strategy is not effective anymore?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
There is no correct answer to your question as it totally depends on any trader's risk profile. In our opinion, one should determine his/her maximum drawdown limit during a year such as 20%, 25% or 30%, then if the system you trade reaches that point any time during one year period, let's say between 1/1 and 31/12, you can cut off trading with that system for that year. Next year you should start trading with the same system because any mechanical system can produce negative results on annual basis. If the system goes bad for the second year in a row, then the trader should sit back and seriously consider about the system and he/she should determine what is going wrong and try to improve it according to changing market conditions if that is the main reason for failing.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I have a question for team aphid, as of right now, I am in a long for trade 1, now trade 2,3, and 4 are about to trigger(at 61.2 and 38 fib lines). the blue line has already surpassed original stop loss point, if I were to enter trade 2,3, and 4 now, would i still have my stop loss for them at a significant low +10 pips or should it be the bat line?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
We guess your position is on GBPUSD. And we believe your swing low bar is at 04/16 09:00 bar, 1.9862 low. If this is the case your stop will be 1.9862 minus 10 pips, 1.9852. And you should have closed one lot (taken at 61.8 fib level on 04/16 14:00 bar) in profit (exit at 04/16 15:00 bar). Then you should have taken trade # 2,3 and 4 at 15:00 and 16:00 bars respectively. As of now, blue ATR line is at 1.9845 and your stop is at 1.9852. Whenever blue ATR line surpasses 1.9852 level, your new stop loss will be trailed by this blue ATR line. Until then, your stop will be at 1.9852.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Ok so just to confirm....lets say I entered trade 1 at 1.9800, stop loss 1.9750(significant low -10), then the pair retraces back to trigger trade 2, 3, and 4. but while triggering, the bat line has reached 1.9770. so while triggering trade 2,3, and 4, the stop loss would be 1.9770(and not 1.9750) even though its only few pips away from the entry point?? Thanks. Zalak

--- 帖子 #586 ---
ATR line has always priority as a stoploss if and only if it is higher than significant low -10 and lower than significant high + 10. Therefore, SL in your example will be 1.9770.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Trying to livin up the thread here since its fallen off the first page i'm trying to come up with ways to determine when to enter when a either side of the court has the ball. The idea here is the price passes through a blue/green BAT 8-12.7 and then buys are placed at all light blue/red BAT 300-2.0. The idea is, once priecmoves above 8-12.7Batline the bulls are in control. Now avoiding pulls you can buy when the bulls are ideally buying as well. Basically using the longer bat to determine who is in control, and the 300lightblue to pinpoint where the buying is happening again. But i am having problems with the indicator, and i'm not sure if its native to the modified version i'm using(V2 with median closing etc) but sometimes price breaks the BAT line, but for some reason is not strong enough to force the indicator to draw the 2nd line. i've circled what i'm referring to. If there was a way to make a popup of when the indicator is saying its strong enough to force that 2nd line formation that would be sweet. But i post my settings because it seems to work well, filtering out some bad trades visually. I just want more ideas/thoughts flowing on around here. Tell me what you think, maybe we can improve. or maybe my settings are stupid BAT ATR V2 ATR PERIOD 8 FACTOR 12.7 = green and orange lines BAT ATR V2 ATR PERIOD 300 FACTOR 2 = light blue and red lines

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hello, TeamAphid and thank you for sharing this beautiful method! Quote main rules: "This re entry can only take place if the price stays within the boundary set by the 161.8 level" Here is the situation on the chart. the shadow of the 1st candle hits 161.8 level. Have I to - re enter @ Start level? - enter @ 61.8 level? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Yes, its based on this system. no change in rules, i follow them to the T.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
If price hits 161.8 level, then you will not enter #2, 3 and 4 trades. So, you will hold only one lot and trail it with ATR line.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Thanks for your contribution. It is always possible to change parameters and possibilities are endless. If you think your parameters are working well, then the next step should be proper backtesting to see if they are really good. By doing so, you can feel how the indicator behaves in certain situations and solve many problems when you do have during visual backtesting.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Rave, v2 default setting uses close to switch BAT line, while v1 uses High/Low, you can change CloseBase parameter. any idea why you use 300 in 1H TF ? I am thinking using ATR 2 and Factor 1, because of responsiveness. Play with these indicators as well, I like to use M5 with compressed view to get the overall picture.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hey guys, did anybody have this problem? when i try to backtest this strategy the indicator only shows up from fab 07 till today.....but not before that. I tried to get some help on other thread and here is the answer I got..... QUOTE: //---- indicator parameters extern int BackPeriod = 1000; extern int ATRPeriod = 3; extern double Factor = 3; extern bool TypicalPrice = false; These are the first lines of the indicator. I see a Backperiod set to 1000. And as expected it did not go far. If you change this line in the indicator to let's say 10000 it will show you much more. Of course it is better to ask the creators of the indicator why they have this limitation. I understand that it will calculate faster. If this is the only concern of the creators then you can go and change it. Regards QUOTE END... do you know why this is the case?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
It was meant for performance, as this indicator is called from others (8TF,MTF), but unlike HAS, BAT didn't experience performance lag, so it is not necessary to use BackPeriod, change to 0 with this updated file, so you can have all bars painted.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Ok good, I will try it out. Thanks. Zalak

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Here are my observations so far... I did some extensive backtesting with something similar in mind except that I used 3 moving averages to define up-trend, down-trend, and range bound conditions. I took every trade the BAT indicator said to take then assigned a specific condition to each completed trade according to my indicators. It was a lot of work... Unfortunately, the results were not what I hoped for. No matter how I tried to define market conditions, by far my most profitable scenerio was to take each entry the BAT indicator said to. Call me captain obvious here, but I think it's good to remind everyone that this is FAR from a "mechanical" system. It basically has only one mechanical component... Entry. The one element that has *substantially* impacted my profitability is the good ole' swing line, and placement of it is entirely discretionary. After a lot of practice with it profitability has dramatically improved. So, like many other systems practice is the key.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
I will do some testing on years 2004-2005 GBPUSD and post results here in a day or two. it looks like Team aphid did their testing for year 2006.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Do you have any rules for placing it? Thanks

--- 帖子 #601 ---
sm31, Can you give more explanations about 3 MAs and how you filter BAT trades, also did you try another setting of BAT indicator ? How about combining with multiple timeframes ? Your backtest will become an asset for us, if you go into details.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I have experimented in every possible way to filter the losing trades on this system, it just does not work: the system in its entirety as put forth by TA produces the best results. You do not need any additional indicators to show you the trend, the method itself gets you on the right trend. You can use it on 4h charts with good results as well, if you want less monitoring.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Thanks for sharing your observations with us. ATR indicator gives more than enough room to trades and trends to develop, and due to its lagging nature as most of the indicators have, we use price action for entry and exits. Therefore, adding another lagging indicator will worsen the results, we believe. We don't agree with you regarding your idea about how mechanical our system is. Mechanical means to apply the well-defined rules 100%, like a robot, and not using any discretions during application. Changing the parameters does not change the mechanical nature of any system. If you can apply the rules mechanically with different parameters, the system is still mechanical as long as you apply all entry, exit, SL, TP rules. We initially set the rules and trade this system according to those rules, we are not bending them and we are not using any judgement before entering or exiting. If you enter or exit trades with modified rules at each entry and exit, then you cannot talk about mechanical system.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
There is only one non objective part of your system- On most trades, there are two or three "recent or significant low"s (or highs) to choose from. This choice makes a great deal of difference in the outcome. It can make the difference of being stopped out or going on to profit. If money management is being applied, of risking a certain percentage of the bank on each trade, the choice of pivot also determines how much profit will be made on successful trades. A robot could not choose the pivot using these instructions "a recent or significant low".

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Billbss stated it perfectly in the previous post. The reason I think of this system as more discretionary in nature is that the one "discretionary" element of the system seems to have by far the greatest impact on profitability. In looking at your backtest results, I couldn't define a strict set rules for your placement of the swing high/low. It looked like a discretionary decision on your part. If not, can you share your rules for placement of the line? I may have missed it in a previous post. In my first shot at applying a strict rule to the swing line like the "most recent swing high/low" I found that many times the line was just too far out. Risk/reward was terrible as a result. Since the "big money" on BAT is in trend following, the tighter we can reliably place the swing line, the better (obvious again...). But I'm having difficulty in working up a set of hard rules to do so.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I just tried the old 5/13/62 EMA cross strategy to define up, down, or range bound conditions. I didn't experiment with other moving averages because I don't think it's a worthwhile pursuit. TA mentioned that since the MA's are lagging indicators, they don't add value to the BAT strategy and from my testing I'm inclined to agree. Most of my testing has been with GBP/JPY on the 4 hour chart with settings of 3 and 3.0. The 4 hour timeframe takes out some of the whip and I like the way this pair trends.

Although it seems subjective, we use farthest significant low to give time to atr indicator to respond. Therefore, on most trades, it is obvious to us to choose pivot point. According to our observations and backtests, there are only a few trades being stopped out at pivot +10/-10 pips and as we explained in previous posts, you can always reenter in the original trade direction if price reverses again after being stopped out. And if you look at backtest results and if you trade 5 lots version as we do, you will see that fibo/pivot related trades are only 20% of total result (for GBPJPY, in 2006, 1627 pips out of 8119 pips). Therefore, due to above reasons, pivot choice does not make a great deal of difference in the outcome compared to trend following component of the system. But we agree that pivot point instructions are discretionary in that sense, especially depending on risk profile of trader. As a team, since we prefer larger stoplosses for this system due to obvious reason, we can easily choose pivot points without any discussions among us.

Do your backtests reflect this type of reentry?

--- 帖子 #610 ---
What about the real value of those pips? I realized I may have caused confusion with my comment about "big money". To clarify... When my money management rules are applied, pips attain a specific value unique to each trade. I first calculate the maximum risk in pips for a trade should the "full monty" stop out. Then I assign a $ value per pip based on the % of my account I am willing to risk per trade (5% currently). So the value is really in the amount of pips earned vs risked rather than a straight pip count. Does TA employ a similar money management technique for BAT?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
For GBPJPY, this type of reentry occured only once during 2006 and our backtests do not reflect that. But we are using that strategy for trading our real time accounts not to miss the trade if price reverses before hitting ATR line. Actually, the number of SL cases caused by swing low/high -/+ 10 pips is just 6 during 2006. So, effect of choosing swing low/high in that sense is minimal compared to number of overall trades.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
What you do is actually risk management and we use similar strategy to determine how many lots we are going to trade with respect to our initial capital. We are not doing that for each trade as backtest statistics give us approx. drawdown for the system. At this point, money management comes into play. We use Ryan Jones' Fixed Ratio method which helps risk management aspect as well.

Im new with this system, now I draw fibo lines and pending order, can you help please, is order oh key??? Thx bj

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I have automated this strategy &amp; I found the best match for the significant high/low was to use the 60 bar high or low. In most cases it matches the 'significant' swing high or low.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Yes the order looks great! I entered it this morning and up 23 pips right now. did u take this trade?

--- 帖子 #616 ---
yes I did, but on friday before news I think its risk, could you please give me answer on questions- do you close all trades and pending orders before weekend??, did you test only for inst. London open? or USA open? or togother?, or only Asia? thx for your answer,

--- 帖子 #617 ---
I agree with you about not trading at news time or keeping orders open for the weekend. I personally do keep all open positions open but with a stop during the weekend. I cancel the pending orders. this issue can go either way. I have been burned twice in past year for keeping orders open during weekend or news events. and to be honest, it wasnt a huge burn. so I keep it open. Not sure what you mean by testing only for inst london open? if u mean i have preferred time of trading for this strategy, the answer is no. since the testing was done for 24 hours a day, I stick to what was tested. but there was an interesting study done by FXCM on most activity by time: EUR/USD MOVEMENTS IN HOURS Asian Session (7PM-4AM): 51 European Session (2AM-12PM): 87 US Session (8AM-5PM): 78 Europe (3AM-12PM): 84 US Europe Overlap (8AM-12PM): 65 Europe-Asian Overlap (2AM-4AM): 32

--- 帖子 #618 ---
thx for nice answer. I add indicators which I like look et picture,

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I see, good. have you backtested wiht this indicator? are your results better with this than the original system? Currently I am trying to backtest this strategy all the way from 01/2004 till today with money managemetn, account balance integrated. its a slow process as I approach it with fixed risk per trade and increase risk with specific return milestones. will let u know once i am done.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
no I didnt test, I dont know it, I like 15 min , maybe only gou long when fisher and flat trend blue and up red BAT line and vice versa short? necessary test for 15 min better fisher rPeriod 30 bj

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Hello Team Aphid, I have a question for you. please review attached chart. I was trying to backtest your strategy all the way from 01/2004. now something interesting happend on 9th march 2004. there was a short trade entered.....then trade 2 and 3 were entered....then they all got stopped out....but the red line was still higher and never got breached. so i didnt enter a long trade...and i was stopped out from the short trade too. then the price began a lonnngggg trend on the short side.....so in cases like this would you recommend a short entry? or just stay out?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
colud you please test it- on 15 min every trades when price gou through bat line with profit, need find optimal profit and SL, Thx

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi zalakinc, sorry for the late reply, it's due to weekend. Anyway, there are two alternatives in this case. Either stay out and wait for next signal OR after you stopped out, you can start entering short again at the same fib levels by targeting original entry level for profit taking and enter 1 or 2 lots short at the original entry level not to miss any trade. We are using this strategy as it may be costly to miss a trend like this, because as you know, most of the pips are coming from trend following component of the system.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Ok makes sense. I will adjust my backtest results accordingly.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
hello friends, I just posted my backtesting results from 01/04 - 09/04 on gbpusd using this strategy. needless to say, it confirms my belief that this is top notch strategy. only 1 month was negative. if u would like to view the file...please go to this link http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post1440940 i will be doing some more backtesting from 10/04 to 12/05. will post once i m done.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Ive quetsion please- is it necessary close candle up to bat line when we buy and only then buy or is enough the price go up bat line ? and vice versa like on picure price penetrate bat line up Thx

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Check the level of BAT Line, and for buy orders, put a limit order 1 pip above the BAT line and for sell orders, put a limit order 1 pip below BAT line to make sure price hits the BAT line.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
On buys, you need to put an order 1 pip + spread above the bat line. Otherwise you'll be entering below the bat line.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
so trade on picture with loss, test you please also close up or down bat line and only then enter?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
two purlple line loss trade ,against trend, how filter this? price went only a few pips up bat lines? thx

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Brainjt, I have also been looking at the similiar issue. but if u do backtesting for past couple of years....some of the filters i have tried wont give better results than original bat. may be u will have better luck

--- 帖子 #632 ---
thx for answer, necessary study,

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I just got back to looking at this method has there been any modifications to the system since the pdf came out? Thanks

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I'm sure this is a great system. I traded it for a couple of weeks and it is a monster to manage- it requires constant attention. I learned a good lesson from it. Do-ability is more important than profitability.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
aah believe me....its hard to manage...Right now i am on my way to some beach in SC and i have to stop by every two hours to see the trade....my firneds and wife are so annoyed by team aphid they will kill you if they ever find out where you live ....lol.

For the life of me I cannot figure out how to put on this indicator into MetaTrader. Im not familiar with metatrader as I use FXSol usually. Can anyone give me any pointers? Thanks Beiruti

--- 帖子 #640 ---
go under metatrader folder, experts, indicators...and save it there....then restart metatrader...it should be under indicators...custom indicators....

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hi All, I just found this thread and let me say, its awesome!! Big thanks go to Team Aphid for developping AND SHARING this strat for free with us. While reading ant backtesting this strategy, it remind me of another good strategy which is also very good BUT hard to manage, as you need to be constantly monitoring the trades. Of course am talking about the ICWR Trading System. So.. Both are very good strat but you need to be very disciplined and not try to bend the rules ELSE it won't work as expected. All the best and THUMbS UP.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Hi Bat Traders. Does anybody know some good exit strategy for this method? I am using ATR lines for stop losses but looking for some better tool. Please, share your styles. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
One thing i did realize from my backtesting is that sometimes, Its ok to break the rule of low +/- 10 as your stop loss. now I think 90% of the time, this rule shouldnt be brokern.....when should it? well, when the lowest low candle has a huge spike or what japanese call the lower shadow. in that case, if its a long trade,I have just taken the close(if the candle closed lower than open) or open(if closed higher) - 10 Pips. Now of course, vice a versa for short trade. a perfect example is the long trade that opened up this morning. BY absolute standards, the stop loss would be 1.9665 but i saw that around 1.9685 four candles had long lower shadows so it acted as a strong support so I decided to use 1.968 as my stop loss.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hello Teamaphid, how many number of systems do you trade currently? and how do u check to make sure the correlation isnt very high between those systems? Thanks. Zalak

--- 帖子 #645 ---
We use different accounts for each system and consider the correlation within the account on currency basis, not among the accounts. We trade modified pabloski for gbpjpy only so far, and still testing other currencies such as eurjpy and gbpusd. We trade BAT. We also trade some other our own systems (one hedging, one with no stoploss, one breakout to name a few, which are all 100% mechanical).

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hi Team aphid, Just wanting to clarify your interpretation of a couple of points with this strategy, if I may, First scenario, when first order is initiated at ATR and this position moves to 161.8 (and does not move any further) , you would cancel entry orders at 38.2 and 61.8 retracements ? Second scenario, if first order breaks ATR, then shows very little movement ie only breaks ATR by a few pips, say 10 or so, stalls before moving, then you would retain retracement orders for additional positions ? I guess what I am asking is, how to detirmine what you consider as a break above the ATR before deleteing additional orders, for example, is it at 161.8 or is it any pull back before hitting 161.8 ? or can this be left to discretion ? I have traded using the fibs for sometime, I am following this strategy with great interest. Thanks for your contribution

--- 帖子 #647 ---

Team Aphid, Thank-you for your response, thanks for answering my questions Much appreciated

Team Aphid, This looks to me to be a good candidate for range bound trading with BAT. Do you confirm? I am using MIG demo for this picture.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Yes, it is a good example of range trading with BAT.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hi There I am new to all this and found the bat system to work for me. It seems that is was made for the GBP. Does it work for the other major pairs?? Many thanks. Bates

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hey Bates, Glad to find its working for you. same thing here...love it. it has had mixed performance last few trades but all systems go through that. It has not been tested on any other pair as of right now. if you were to backtest it, I would recommend something with very low levels of correlation with cable.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
TeamAphid said they used it on GBP/USD, GBP/JPY and EUR/AUD.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Oh ok, my mistake then.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Many thanks for the advice. Bates.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Is anybody in the current trade on cable? it came wihtin like 2 pips of the red line twice...woohh! good one.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi All I just try to learn this method... seems very very interesting one Have some question : 1. What is the setting for bat lines (red and blue lines), because from pic that zalakinc send seems different from me. 2. From the pic that i send, the price get down from blue line but not cross blue line because the line already change to red. Is that valid entry or we need to price cross bat line? 3. I still confuse about TP level.... Can somebody explain to me? Thx Waiting for answers

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Ok lets go through it one by one..... 1 - may be your lines are different because your datafeed is different. what datafeed do you use? I use alpari which is preferred by teamaphid and several professional traders. 2 - Yes, the price did cross it thats why you dont see it anymore. whenever you see the blue line stopping to draw and red line appears, that means the cross did happen. Hope that makes sense. Lets take an example. Lets say Blue bat line is at 1.9700 and current candle closed at 1.9705. so its still above blue bat line, the cross hasnt happend. now the next candle closes at 1.9694, so it did go through the blue line. On the graph, You will only see it when the close it lower than the blue line when it crossed it. if it crossed it but didnt close below the blue line, you will not see it on the graph. but just visualize that the line is there for one more bar. hope that makes sense. 3 Target profit level is nothing but the crossing of the other line. so lets say in teh example we are discussing...we entered short at 1.9700 where the cross happend. it keeps going down all teh way to 1.9600. so we are up 100 pips in unrealized profits, at that time the red bat line is at 1.9625. now...the next candle is a very strong positive candle and touches that red bat line and crosses it. You would have that trade closed at 1.9625. so your realized profit would be 75 pips. hope that makes sense. HERE IS WHAT I DO EVERY 90 MINUTES TO MANAGE THIS STRATEGY EFFECTIVELY: 1 - Move my stop loss for the open trade if the bat line has moved 2 - Move my entry order for my next entry. so if you are currently in a short trade, you would enter long trade at the current bat line level. and you have keep updating that every hour to two hours to make sure you enter that trade even if you are sleeping. 3 - I set audible or sms alerts at the bat line. because once you enter at the bat line, you set your trade 2 and 3 entry points. that would be fibonnaci trades. hope this makes sense.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I use alpari too My setting for bat lines is : Back period = 1000 ATR Period = 5 Factor = 4.0 Typical price = false

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Mine is Back period = 50000 - Because i was trying to test starting 2004 ATR - 3 FActor - 3 Typical Price 0- False it looks like team aphid recommends ATR period to be 5 and factor to 4. so you are right. I think what happend is I had to recently download a new metatrader. in that time, my settings might have reset. damn it, now I will have to check all my backtested data to make sure it was done with the correct settings.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hello Hattrick, Thank you very much for this, I just realized I did a year worht of backtesting data on wrong settings!!! Although it did show consistent profits!!! so i guess what I need to do next is do a backtest with ATR 5 and Factor 4 and see how the results compare.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Quick question about ranging. Do we take a position each time one of our fibo numbers are hit if they have not been taken profit? In the picture, it shows price bouncing around the 61.8 level. Would we enter each time it is touched or would we wait for it to take profit before we re-enter on a retracement?

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Wait for it to take profit before you enter again.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Thank you billbss. That is what I was thinking but I wanted to make sure first.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
can this strategy be used on 4 hours time frame?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Its not intended for a 4H timeframe.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hello everyone, just wanted to say hello and post. I have been following the bat and just finished the thread after about a week. Team Aphid thank you for your system and to the people posting, especially those who have read the documentation thank you for your insight. I realize that we still have not come up with a better exit strategy and even more difficult a mechanical strategy. While not exactly mechanical, I have recently tried using DeMark Trend lines as a way to out retraces especially when I am already up a decent amount in the trade. When the TDTL is broken, I exit and will reenter if the retrace turns. I also use a basic STOCH for this. I have to admit, I have only used it for the last weeks GBPUSD trades, but it worked well and I finished with two 125 pips trades and than a 250 Pipper, so I'm happy. Kept some pips off the table, on my plate. Just food for thought. Hope this thread stays alive. Much love to the entire FF, you guys have helped me immensly, even if some of you dont know. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hi all, i have started fwd testing on a demo account this wk using BAT method. On top of that i using 1) price action - candlesticks and 2) RSI to determine my entry and exit. So far the results has been positive 43 and 72pips. Will update if there's more concrete results. Cheers

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Why are you adding things to the system? It's fine the way it is. You add things because you don't have enough faith in the system... so you keep adding and adding and adding until you have a screen full of stuff that makes you confused. This system is fine without adding more indicators. You're doing yourself an injustice otherwise.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
I couldn't agree more... It's very generous system even if you get some loses during sideway moving markets.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
There's a reason why TA has decided to offer signals now... Because, with discipline, this system is extremely profitable.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
couldnt agree with you more! its a great great system. finally I am profitable for past 3 months consistently thanks to this system. fellow FF Members, if you do add RSI, or MACD or whatever, I have one suggestion. Please dont judge their effectiveness by 2 or 4 trades. backtest it for 6-12 monhts and compare the results to the backtest of original bat for the same time period. then make the decision. but I completely agree....the system is great the way it is. I dont really care about losses during choppy environment, i care about monthly performance. and in my 2 years of backtesting, 21 out of 24 months were positive. By the way, Teamaphid.com's signals are absolutely phenomenal. they also have about 83% months positive. think about it...when you combine teamaphid.com's signals with this system....probability of you haveing a negative month almost goes down to zero.

hi, i am new to this topic, on the indicator from front page, the atr was 3 period , factor 3, so we need to change it to 5 ,4 am i right? can also recommend me 3 pairs to trade?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
You are correct on the change of settings to ATRPeriod 5 and Factor 4. I believe TA has indicated they are trading BAT on the GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, and EUR/AUD.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hello Team Aphid! Wow! Just finished reading this thread and it is very impressive what you folks have done here! Just wanted to add my thanks to you as well. In my study of your system, I noticed something which may fall into the category of "If it ain't broke, don't FIX it!" or perhaps a splitting of hairs, but here goes.... I notice that in your instructional PDF on post #35, you say to label the fibo levels as follows: LEVEL 0.000 - Description: "Swing" LEVEL 0.382 - Description: "38.2 - 2 lots" LEVEL 0.618 - Description: "61.8 - 1 lot" LEVEL 1.000 - Description: "Enter - 1 lot" LEVEL 1.618 - Description: "161.8" Please correct me if I am wrong, but I do not believe this Fibo label setup is correct. It appears to me that your Fibo retracements are displayed backwards. The retrace levels of 38.2 and 61.8 should be shown as a percent of the total price move from SWING to ENTRY (BAT line break). Logically then, shouldn't a 38.2% retrace occur before a 61.8% retrace? The way you currently show them puts a 61.8% retrace AHEAD of a 38.2% retrace which I do not believe is correct or logical. Unless I am missing something and am totally off-base, then I suggest the following labels and changes to drawing the Fibos: LEVEL 0.000 - Description: "Enter - 1 lot" LEVEL 0.382 - Description: "38.2 - 2 lots" LEVEL 0.618 - Description: "61.8 - 1 lot" LEVEL 1.000 - Description: "Swing" LEVEL -0.618 - Description: "-61.8" The "Swing" needs to be at level 1.000 because if price retraced back to that level, it would represent a 100% Fibo retrace. The touch of the BAT line (trade #1 entry) should be at the 0.000 level. Also, you show level 1.618 which I believe should instead be level -0.618 (but should be labeled +61.8%) which represents an ADVANCE of 61.8% past the entry point in the desired direction of the trade. The final thing should be to make sure to always draw the Fibos starting from the SWING point and move up or down to the ENTRY point. This will ensure that your fibo retracements are always displayed in the correct direction. Again, this may seem irrelevant or like "splitting hairs" to some and if the current method of labeling is working for you, then don't change anything. I just wanted everyone to be on the same page with the Fibo's and again, if I have missed something, then please feel free to correct MY logic. Assuming that I am correct with this, I wonder what effect it may have on backtesting results, if any? Thanks again TA for allowing us to use THE BAT! I hope to start demo trading it this Monday. P.S. I've attached a couple of charts to show what I'm speaking about.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hi Pipskateer In my opinion if you put 2 Lots on Fib level 0,382 and the system fails, you will have extremely high drawdown risk. I use this method for my live trading and there is a lot of false crosses. Try forwartest and post here your results.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Hi Rosso, I just requoted what the TA PDF document already said to use for the amount of lots to open on Fib level 0.382. Perhaps TA might advise 2 lots being opened on the 0.618 level instead of 0.382 once the levels are shown in their proper fibo order. My main concern was that the 0.618 and 0.382 fibos are apparently being drawn in reverse order. Actually, the levels themselves are correct, but perhaps just need to be labeled in reverse to compensate. Left as is, this issue may present more problems for the EA developers, but I just wanted to point it out here in case it might have some bearing on profit outcomes for those who are only using the indicator.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hi Pipskateer, Thanks for warning us. In terms of labelling, what you indicate is correct, therefore fibos should be drawn by starting from swing low/high. But then, we should open 1 lot at 0.382 and 2 lots at 0.618 to keep the original rules in place. Therefore, there will be no difference in backtest results. Thanks again for pointing out this issue. Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi Team Aphid and thanks for a great system, when trading the 1 hour GBP/JPY have you tried using the 4 hour GBP/JPY and 1 hour GBP Bat ATR's as filters? i.e. only trade in the same direction as the 4 hour GBP/JPY and current 1 hour GBP Bat ATR's?... ... thanks, Peter.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
We haven't tested it properly, but if you use 4 hour GBPJPY direction, you will have more lagging effect on your trades. It may filter some bad ones, but should be tested properly before reaching any conclusion. Thanks for the input.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Based on your experience this system works best with wich pairs?

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hello team Aphid, i am thinking of making a couple of changes to the your sytem, firstly i am putting the stop 5 pips above or below the 61.8 retracement level (or 32% as in the pdf). Then for entry the price must break the high or low of the candle that breaks the ATR line by 5 pips. This keeps us out of many of the choppy trades. Two contract as entered, one is exited at the 1.44 extension (this is not calculated from the low or high to the bat line, but from the low or high to the low or high of the candle that breaks the BAT line). Once the 1.44 is hit half the trade is taken off at this level and the stop is moved to B/E. The second contract is either exited at B/E or at teh BAT line. This i beleive improves risk to reward while alo keeping us out of the bad choppy trades. by taking off one contract at the 1.44 means we can still profit in sideways makets. i'll do testing on this but would like to hear your views also. Cheers Charlie

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi Charlie Your change sounds interesting. Have you by any chance done any backtesting with your theory or is your comment from just eyeballing the losing trades? I look forward to seeing your tests. I won't make further comment until I do a few eyeballs but your changes do seem to address the areas of concern that the BAT system has. Cheers

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Hi Charlie Just to confirm and throw in a visual. Your change includes not taking any retracement trades. Fair enough as your later entry will probably make this less feasible. Of course the trade off is that there will be less negative trades. Does this chart confirm your changes?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Could it be possible to wait for a close of a bar for entry that is 5 pips below the hi or low of the breaking bar??? Could this be another option and maybe protect from nasty little price spikes? See chart.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Hi I've taken over 1000 pips out of GBP/JPY using 1hr chart BAT system in the last 2 weeks However I only trade 1 lot and only enter on the next candle after the first touch unless the breaking candle is very large I do not trade. Also after 80 pips profit I lock in trade for +10 pips, thereafter its a free ride. If it takes more than 5 hours (5 candles) to trade higher/lower than the first candle that touches the BAT bar I stay away until the next signal. Have a look at the 1 hour chart on the GBP/JPY. I trail the stop 100 behind until the BAT trailing loss line has 300 pips locked in, this way it lets the trade breath and expand to maximise your return I've been trading on and off for years and this is by far the best I've encountered and its very simple. Only 1 hour chart remember. Regards Dave

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Rumbey, Amazing results. Are you trading manually, or using the BAT EA? If so, what version and what are the settings?

--- 帖子 #693 ---
WOW. what are the setings your using? I made a change to the ATRPeriod and Factor and have got excellent results. It's very good. But when I change the settings in the EA it doesn't work it doesn't trigger the orders. May be some one can help.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Sound good guys but the only thing i would say is test test and test more......... I'm still working on this BAT system... i've spend hrs testing 18 months of GBP trades now moving on to EURJPY.... after this i'll test another 12 months for each of these currency pairs.. and only after this will i trade it... I suggest everyone tests their ideas and then perhaps we can move forward with a better system, otherwise its an idea and nothing else.. i wouldn't even trade it with your money!

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Just totalled up August pips using my simple BAT ATR v1 period 5 factor 3.9. Up 2554 pips if this current trade closes on its current BAT line. Total of 8 trades, 3 closed at Breakeven + one at amazing trade = 1589 pips :-) I use an initial 100 pip stop loss and move to Breakeven or +10 pips after price moves 80 (include spread) I only use a 1 hour chart now as I used to have multiple charts up to confirm trend etc but it was confusing.

Only on GBPJY ? I can't believe it ! Can you show us a report of opened &amp; closed trades ? Please

Hi I'm not divulging my private financial information. Just set BAT up on the 1 Hour chart and take a look yourself I now have an email alert that goes to my mobile phone as a text sms message when the price gets within 50 pips of a possible reversal bat line. This should reduce the amount of time I spend on this system, so I can enjoy a bit of free time. No system to me is worth being tied to the computer screen 24/7.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
See this post : http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...3&amp;postcount=21 I don't find such results with the manual BAT system on GBPJPY. That's why I don't see how you can get 2554 pips... can you tell us what is your time slot and your broker ?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Setting on 1 hour chart only 5 and 3.9. Only enter on the next candle after the first candle has pierced the BAT line

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Closed my long (230.93) at 232.45 reversed short. Profit from last trade = 152 pips Just on hourly chart

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Rumbey, I like the idea of the email alert. How did you set it up?

--- 帖子 #702 ---
I'm short at 232.30

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Go to the alerts tab on bottom of MT4 Platform and set it up manually

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Hi I just set up a price alert near the nearest BAT line and that's it. in MT$ or your own trading software there should be a similar function. It goes to my mobile so I can check what's happening like earlier today. I reversed on the confirming hourly candle . The candle that goes lower than the first piercing candle. 100 pip stop loss move this to Breakeven after 100 pips so if price goes to 231.45. Then I leave it alone as its a free trade. This way you let your profits run and its completely stress free until the next BAT line comes into play for a reversal possibly but not always. If September is as good as August I'll be happy Dave

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Rumbey, Thanks, I got the alerts working. Another question: I understand your initial 100 pip S/L and then move to B/E or +10 after the price moves 80 pips. But do you also trail your stop when the BAT line moves to lock in profits above 80 pips; or do you just leave it and wait for the alert and then reverse?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hit my S/L at 233.30 Will wait for next signal.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
I use the BAT for the trailing stop so you have to be patient. Anyway this is my first lose in 9 trades -100. So I am out . I will wait for the next signal Dave

--- 帖子 #708 ---
The orginal instrucitons on post #35 require the use of FF ATR Trailing Stop v1. Could someone please inform me where i could aquire this indicator?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
The mt4 indicator is on the same post as the pdf. Cheers

--- 帖子 #710 ---
is the program FF ATR Trailing Stop v.1 the same as BAT ATR v1?

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Yes I think is the same but with different atr fand factor numbers.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Dear team Aphid... I have posted here a few times before in the past and have been working to try and find improvements to the basic system. At present i am researching on how to use the BAT line as an entry signal and then a factor of a 7 period ATR as the stop and a first exit point. The stop would be placed 120% of the 7 period ATR below the entry price and the first exit would be placed 120% of the 7 period ATR above the entry price. The second part of the trade would be exited at the BAT line. Also the trade would not be entered at the BAT line, but just 5 pips above the high of the candle that broker the BAT line. This would help keep us out of wipsaw trades. The benefit of trading this way is that it stops some wipsaw trades but also helps increase the risk to reward of the best trades. Often the best trades just take off and don't look back and so the large stops which the system presently uses are not always beneficial, infact the large stops can be detrimental to the system when it is being wipsawed. I have been trading this system off the 4 hr chart. I have also been communicating with PFXGlobal who offer free fundamental advise to people on this site. They have something called the seesaw which is an objective way of ranking the fundamentals of a currency. http://www.pfxglobal.com/index.php?o...785&amp;Itemid=191 The currencies are ranked by the central bank interest rates, 10 year yields, equity market dividend rates and RSI over weekly and monthly charts. So at the moment the JPY is the lowest ranked currency, while the AUD is the highest; therefore we would look to trade long positions on the AUD/JPY. The AUD is also the strongest pair against the USD and therefore we would look to trade long positions on the AUD/USD.. the GBP has been ranked highely over the last 18 months but has now slipped back below the USD and therefore has a bias for the first time in a while to the short side, however we would not trade this pair as they are very close on the seesaw. I believe this could be a very good way of adding a fundamental bias to the BAT system in an almost totally mechanical manner. PFX have told me they are working on providing a history for the seesaw so that a system could be tested against this data. Having traded within a firm i know this is a popular way of adding fundamental bias to a system in a highly simplified and objective way. Would appreciate some feed back and possible help in further researching this if your interested. Regards, Charles p.s enjoying being subscribed to the Team Aphid Bird

Thanks Carlos. This sounds interesting! Which pairs do you use with this 4h-BAT? Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Why don't you post a chart so we understand better.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hi, this is still a very interesting system. How are you trading it? I'm using 2lots for trade 1...I hate the ranging periods of gbp/usd. It's hard to avoid strange movements

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Here is a chart which kind of shows what i am talking about. The trade i am referring to is the long trade in the middle of the chart. I am looking at trading this on the daily chart also. This example is actually a bad trade which was stopped out just through the red line of the stop...... Hope this helps a little. Charlie

--- 帖子 #717 ---
I just got done D-Loading and reading this Pdf file. I see it is built around bar charts. Can this system also be used with candle stick charts at all or is it just for bar charts? Just thought I would ask. Larry Liles

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Charlie Have you tried this method on 1 hour chart??

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Hi, i have also been looking at this on the 1 hr chart. i use factor and period of 3,3. I have also been trying to improve a way of filtering trades to go with the trend. I believe my inital way of the seesaws might not be sensative enough for this lower time frame. I have used MACD with settings (60, 130, 45). I have found this cuts out many trades but a good number of trades can still be achieved if a number of currency pairs are used. I don't believe that this is a process of curve fitting as I have moved this from a futures system i trade on the ER2. However; i would not recommend trading with this filter on higher time frames such as daily charts. I believe this would not be sensative enough and too many trades would be missed. On a lower time frame trade fequency and sensitivity are less important. I am moving this system over to NinjaTrader for auto trading to my Interactive Brokers Account. This will also let me do some more extensive testing. However, first i need to do more manual testing. Trading with the MACD filter on the 1hr chart allows you to take the trades that are with the trend and keeps u out when the market is oscillating because the MCAD signal line is often oscillating in the opposite direction. Lowering the BAT indicator settings to 3,3 makes the line more sensitive and means when i major trend is under way u can still catch part of this move. With the indicator set to 5,4 the trend filter will mean that u might miss the major move. Often you find that major moves start as counter trend move. Suprises to makets offer a squeeze on the market and an aggressive move and repostion in the opposite direction occurs. This is the reasoning to lower the indicators from 5,4 to 3,3. Hope this helps Cheers Charlie

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Hey Charlie thanks a lot for replying. I also trade futures (YM) I have thse same concerns about the see-saw . Just for the sake of knowledge, try to lower to 1 hour frame and compare it to 4hr and notice that 1 hour will give you a lot less false signals. Just do a simple observation without any other indi's. Let me know what you think Cheers

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Charlie Look for post #296 areply from Team Aphid "Hi Squash, we tested other timeframes as well and when you use lower timeframes, like most of the other indicators, you get more signals and more loser trades (but smaller losses of course). The reverse is true for longer timeframes. Therefore, we found 1hr time frame is the most suitable to trade. " I agree with that. Definitely 1hr time frame is the way to go for this indicator

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Yes i have read this before. I want a higher time frame system than will offer diversification my trading. At present I trade futures off tick charts but also two system off 1hr charts for the FX. I am also looking at trading this alternative BAT system of daily charts. I beleive it is also profitable off 1hr chart and offers better risk to reward than the present BAT system. Like all systems my own take with the BAT indicator has its drawdowns. I beleive that back in jan last year there were nine losses in a row, however this could all be made back in one signle trade. Good MM would result in money being made in the longer term, i believe from my testing thus far there was one trade which had a R:R of over 16:1. However, i am still working on this but need to be careful not to fall into the pitfalls of curve fitting. I am presently programming this system for NinjaTrader but am also looking at moving the system over to TS so i can do a more extensive testing on out of sample data. Cheers, Charlie

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hey Carlos Thanks for the insigth. I have my own interpretation about this system as I am following with great interest. My views can't be expressed here as Team Aphid has expresed clearly that it's a mechanical system. At my way of look at BAT, it has proved to be very profitable for me. I hope this thread can be alive for long time Let me know about your progress with ninja trader. Wil be nice to see the use of this system in futures. cheers

Hello, I just upgraded my MT4 account to a live account. Can anyone tell me how to change the data feed to Alpari?? Any information would be greatly appreciated. Rick

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Hello Colostarr, At my best knowledge, MT4 feedback depends on the company you opened the account with. So if you did not opened your Live account with Alpari, you will not get live feed from them but from the broker you used. Nevertheless, you may open a demo account and get Alpari demo quotes to work with. Hope this helps, Hani

Hi Team Aphid ! I learned about ur system a long time ago...and throwed it away after 3 days of testing..guess why? It was too simple and i was a noobie starting out in the FX World ...so now after 10 months of learning in the PF and creating my own system to suit my needs i was in search of some new inputs and stumbled upon this thread again... Just lemme say that i use the bat again and i really can see the beauty of it now.. "when the pupil is ready,the teacher will appear" ..it`s very true..The Bat greatly alligns with my system and i will study it in deep the next months.. thank your for sharing !! u have a fan here ! ---------------------------------------------------- @ accrete U have previousy created an alert indicator when price crosses the Bat Line.. I found it very convinient as i also can use it for price alerts on other charts ! its just easier and faster then the alert function of mt4.. Just one question..is it possible that u could insert an option for "repeatings" of the alerts? so i can for example set it to 300 and it will repeat the alerts 300times until i reset the indicator.. and one last thing..the lines on the chart are not removed when one removes the indicator..its not a big thing but maybe only a little change in the code btw what software did u use to "record" the bat alarm ? because i search a proggie which can playback easy things i write in text.. I thank you very much for this indicator ! Thx again to everybody !! the factory rules !

--- 帖子 #727 ---
: ) Thanks for the kudos on the tweak i did on the alert indy. I'm not aware of any simple code change to get it to do what you are hoping with the repeats though. Maybe someone can take the challenge? Happy trading, Thom

--- 帖子 #728 ---
This is a weird question but one I feel needs asking. If you have noticed, the GBP/USD is going WAY up. Last week, once the red line was broken, price never came close to the blue line for the rest of the week. So far this week, Price broke the red line on Monday, and again traveled so high that it never again came close to the blue line. my question is, is there a way to make the red line "re-form" even if the blue line is never touched?? I feel like I am missing TONS of opportunities when price does this. Also, does anyone know if this pair works on other pairs other than GBP/USD and GBP/JPY?? I would love to broaden my chances of entering trades using this method...at present I feel "handcuffed" to the GBP/USD as I do not trust the GBP/JPY. Any suggestions or maybe you know of another system similar to this one?

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Thx for your answer ! What i mean by "repeatings" is called "itterations" in the mt4 alert box.. Hope somebody can help me soon

--- 帖子 #730 ---
i will start to test it and i d like to know: the initial stop are the same for all trades? that means, aways below the last bottom (for longs)? and when i change it? i can't understand "when the blue line starts to form"...because after the entry the blue line is allready there... thanks in advance for any help.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
not sure how to better explain it to you, but once you enter, just make the blue line your stop loss.

hi, TA, how about the results for Q2, and Q3 these year..thanks and anyone live with this system, can tell me what is the performance this few months becausee i see less ppl in the tread now..

--- 帖子 #734 ---
hi, colostarr, it cost me fews hours to finish up all the post in this tread, so har what is the performance now and what pair did u use BAT system?? thanks

--- 帖子 #735 ---
We are trading a modified version of the BAT by using a similar indicator and therefore we haven't updated the BAT results for Q2 and Q3, therefore you need to backtest those periods. Best Results, Team Aphid

--- 帖子 #736 ---
hmm, so the previous version with default setting 5,4 still can be use?? i back test this month with gu is +498pips till yesterday october +790 august +31 and november gj +38pips and october ej + 682

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Hello nklin88, Sorry for my delay in getting back to you. I only use this indicator on GU, with the settings of 5,4. If you are going to use use GJ, then you should change your settings to 5, 3.9. Also for GJ you need to wait for the break of 2 bars (2nd hourly candle) past the indicator before you get into the trade (which explains your low back test for the pair). I have no idea about EJ...never traded it! With GU, personally I go for 20 pips. I use the 61.8 as a stop loss. With GU and the BAT you are about 97% guaranteed 20 pips (I went 6 weeks straight without any losses!!). I double my lots and get in and out quick! I hate hanging around a trade only to watch my profits trickle back into the system. So I go for 20 pips and OUT! Then I close the chart and don't look at it until the next day! I have a similar approach with the squeeze method...double lots...30 pips...OUT, standard s/l of 30 pips. So far I am 3 out 5 positive trades (+90 pips, 2 lots each for a $2,700.00 3 day profit.).Between the BAT and the squeeze...I have tripled my account since 1 Oct..this year! I love simplicity and these 2 indicators have been very good to me! Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #738 ---
it helps me a lot friend, thanks for ur information and explanation, now i know why the result for gj was so low, thanks again friend lin

Hello Accrete, Thanks for the bat-line-alerts. Where did you get that sexy voice from? Do you know if anyone has found a way to have your audio alert 'move' with the bat line as it trails the trend? At the moment you have to manually drag the blue-bat-line-alert to the price......but if you are away from your desk the bat-line may move but your bat-alert remains in place. Thanks and good trading to you. Stewartr

I have the ae up and running but not long enough to take a trade. However, I did do a back test a few months and the ae started out great but came back and wiped out a 10k balance. An earlyier post stated to get rid of trade 2 and 3 and it will be profitable. I here the manual trading is doing well. Will try and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
hello, Does anyone know if there is a way to have the BAT indicator provided by team Aphid send an email when price reaches either of the BAT lines? thanks, CFII

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I know metatrader can email you when a pair reaches a specific price level, but when bat line it hit, you will have to program it.

Yes I too would like to know if anyone can add an alert to the Bat line itself instead of manually moving the line as the bat-line moves. Especially helps when you're not at the charts.

Hello all Is anyone still currently trading the system and is it still working for you? Happy Pippin' KC

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi friends it seems hard to look for improvements to a system that´s proven profitable. At first I thought that taking profits on Trades 2 /4 goes against the mathematics of letting profits run. BUT it saves the day on range bound markets, which are more than likely to happen .Statisically trends occur more seldom than range bound markets...probably the reason why the majority loose. On profit taking for trade 1: I would take profit at double risk, if you look at most charts, you seldom get a better result waiting for the BAT Stop to hit. Congratulations.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
One of the best summaries I´ve read. Obviously a clear understanding of the challenges...MM being number one...in the end, you may only get a thin "edge", but any mistake will wipe it out...not easy but still possible... Like anything in life, being aware is the answer.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
I incorporate it into my system &amp; it works well for me. I trade on H1 &amp; H4. I reset ATRperiod= 3, facor=2, good for scalp on H1. I reset because my account is too small.

Hi, is anybody still using this? I have been manually backtesting the bat over the last 6months of gbpusd m15, with default settings other than the time period, and results have been great. It seems strange to me this thread has died so to speak...... I'd appreciate it to confront the results if anybody is interested. Wendy

--- 帖子 #752 ---
hello guys, What about the aphid Team ? the system is always traded ? is sombody use it with real money ? it seems to me intresting ..

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Very interesting thread. Thanks Team Aphid for sharing it with us. I am trying to find to trade this system without the indicator, manually on a different platform then Metatrader. If i understand it correctly, all we do is multiply the current Atr5 value with 4, and use the result as our Stop, which is also our next reversal signal..Am i missing here something, or did i get this right?

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Why has this thread died out ? I actually had a really long post written out on this but my goddamn internet crashed and I couldn't post it. Here's a summary of what I said: Across the majors in the last month this system made over a thousand pips with an expectancy of around 1.30. If you add a simple filter and trade with the trend you increase this. I tested GJ since the start of the year, trading the basic BAT entry has an expectancy of 1.25, taking every trade presented. However if you add a simple filter to trade only with the trend you increase expectancy to 2.32. I tested EU since the start of the year with the filter, we are looking at an expectancy of 3.39. If 1% was risked on each trade the result would be +22.6% in six months, an average of a 3.6% increase a month. I have taken spread into account with the above systems. This system has an edge because: 1) It automatically cuts losses short and lets winners run. 2) It capitalises on the inherent volatility in the currency markets. Is there any programmer / Anyone interested in reviving this thread/programming an EA for this system. I believe if one were to add a simple trend filter (No over optimisation needed here) that this is a fully automated and mechanical system that would generate profit over the long term. Jig.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Hey Jig, Agreed, I think better not use MT4 though jforex dukascopy's programable platform would be better . there is a good tester with proper tick data too.I would be interested to form up a team and have been meaning to learn programming....how hard can it be. Had my interest spiked by automated trading recently. we could hire someone in also..... I liked the bat from the start v elegant system. Si

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Actually I had this point in the original message I wrote. I totally excluded the original BAT idea of entering on the retrace of a fibonacci drawn from the swing high/low to the BAT. You know those enter at 2 and 3 trades as outlined in the original BAT pdf. I don't know how Team Aphid came up with the idea in the first place, but it personally makes no sense to me why that would be profitable, there's no reason for anybody to be looking at those specific fibs and therefore no orderflow builds up at those levels. Jig.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
It's an excellent system, as is, in my opinion. I wouldn't clutter it up with filters. I traded it for about a month, and took every trade. Trading it manually will run you nuts. You have to watch it almost every minute of the day. Pending orders have to be continually revised and costly mistakes are inevitable. There was/is an EA for this system, that didn't work (no surprise there).

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Oh hey Swami ! Yeah my interest with automated trading has been spiked lately also, I mean if I spend 14/16hours watching the markets a day I don't really need to be staying awake during Asian session just to trail goddamn stops when a simple EA that would "close y above/below line x" would suffice ! . There's a load of other simple things I would love to have automated just to make my trading day easier. Aside from that I also believe there are simple mechanical edges to be obtained in the forex market and other markets, most of which I believe will be in the market as long as they exist due to microstructure and the inherent nature of the markets as generated by the participants. I've also been meaning to learn programming for these reasons, I mean I spend enough time around the PC monitoring trades anyway so I could use some of that time to learn programming instead of wasting time. And as you rightly said: How hard can it be. I concur that we should form a team, I reckon I would rather learn programming myself than hire somebody else as I like being self sufficient and "understand" what is going on, also I reckon it could be an interesting hobby :nerd: That being said I wouldn't rule out paying a programmer, as I am currently working with a programmer to automate another system of mine anyway . I will look into the Dukascopy JForex as I am unfamiliar with it, I also agree with you about the simple nature of the BAT. Best regards, Jig Also check your PM's EDIT - You don't have PM's enabled, can you enable them/contact me. Thanks

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Bill, Firstly I agree it is profitable as it is, I have visually backtested it for a while and it seems to consistently achieve positive expectancy after you take spread into account. Trade it over a variety of currency pairs and other markets and that equity curve can be smoothed, for example GBPUSD was -400pips or so for the last month but the other currency pairs made up for this. When I say filter I mean a simple automatic trend defining indicator, a simple 21ema 50sma cross from a higher timeframe would do the trick in my humble opinion. I don't want to get into optimising etc but something trend defining from a higher timeframe would improve expectancy. 2ND EDIT : Reading this back this seems rather arrogant of me which I do not mean to be, from reading Team Aphids posts they obviously backtest everything thoroughly, know what they are talking about and have probably tried this idea already, but from my initial (albeit relatively small in timescale) backtests a filter improves expectancy. I will manually backtest more tomorrow. Although I see from the earlier posts in the thread especially the post/posts made by hanover and Team Aphid that they tried to filter out trades but by doing so what happens is you indeed do filter some losses but you also filter out big winners. My initial thoughts were that a filter would help immensely however I would like to see what the results would be on years on the 1HR on years like 2003 and 2006. I saw the thread where the EA was going to be programmed and where no programming was achieved, it was strange to me that no success was achieved considering there's usually people programming all sorts of terrible ideas around this sub forum . Just a few questions if you don't mind, What do you think of the number 2 and 3 entries as outlined originally ? Did you use them ? I assume you stuck to the 1HR timeframe ? Thanks in advance. Regards, Jig. EDIT - I agree with the "run you nuts" of trading something like this manually, It's like my trailing stops, it can't be that hard for me to help myself program a two bar stop ala the Turtles and stop having to look at charts and move stops every 15Mins. I actually use the BAT for trailing stops on various systems as well, except I use a close above/below instead of the "touch"

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I liked the 2nd and 3rd trades. They did what they were designed to do- return profits if price started ranging. They seemed to work, for that purpose. There was a Bat EA thread. There was an EA. I tried it on a demo platform. It didn't follow the rules. That thread and EA is around somewhere.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Indeed it's over here : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=14073 (You posted in that thread to advise people not to add filters too ) Hmmm, I see, I actually just looked over a rangy period and it does have it's merits. Would you consider 3rd June - 2nd July on GBPJPY a rangey period for this system ? Or the last month on GBPUSD . . . Actually I'm going to test those tomorrow. I think you are correct bill. Also assuming that entries 2 and 3 are profitable in rangey markets there is no need for a filter. If one is to enter on the 2 and 3, when is a loss taken ? At the swing which the trade is based off of or is 2 and 3 exited with the BAT ? I remember the TP was going to be at the initial BAT line. More importantly what sort of MM were you employing ? I see Team Aphid didn't use %R. I initially discarded it as in my mind there is no reason for the Fib's to actually work if you get me, as there's nobody basing a trading decision based on the retracement of a Fib which has a swing high/low which is not a real swing high/low . . . If you get me. I assume Team Aphid looked at it the Fib's, and recorded the amount of times that such an outcome occured when the fib retracements were striked and it was profitable. I think it's profitable just because of averaging down and it's easier to turn around and travel back to a price with relatively smaller orderflow between it than having to fight the orderflow to take out the swing. It's not like the fib's have any magical powers of their own. Aside as a reason to average down. I actually had another idea which would work in ranging enviornments, I will backtest both of them vs eachother tomorrow. Really appreciate your input bill, Jig

--- 帖子 #610 ---
The SL for the 2 and 3 trades is the same as for the main trade. I found that if you compute the lot size for the main trade at a 1% risk, and use that same lot size for 2 and 3, the combined risk of all 3 trades is 2%. I would either do 1% for a combined 2% or 1.5% for a combined 3%. Bear in mind, sometimes you'll set the 2 and 3 up more than once. I've seen them hit TP three or more times.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
I'll check those dates and charts out when I have a second. I don't right now, but I will and get back to you. If you think they look like ranging, I'm sure they are.

Seems like there was action elsewhere in relation to this system, Some people over at a different forum created a version of this system in EA form, the admin of said site is selling the EA for $70 dollars. I don't want to advertise that service so I won't post a linky. But there are points made in a more recent thread there, than this one, which I will address here so as any interested parties will not have to trawl through content. First of all they made changes to the base of the system: (Entering on the close might solve the trading frustration/lack of EA programmability issue, meaning manually you would only have to check it every hour. I use the "close" idea for some trailing stops I have used for years and personally find it way better than the "kiss") A person their outlines a problem of using the fibs, outlining one of the reservations I had: Anyway, one of the people had a demo going on, and at first the result's were: Attached Image (click to enlarge) However the result's quickly turned into: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Above demo owner then states: And he then set the system to private. The problems were obviously thus: 1) %R was way too high, 3% a trade is way high. 1% is more reasonable. 2) System was traded on I think four JPY crosses. This is obviously way too correlated. Maybe 3) When using trade 1 alone, in theory I still think a trend detecting filter would increase expectancy by stopping you getting creamed in extended periods of ranging. However the use of the fib retracement trades might also serve this purpose. I'll go backtest those dates tomorrow also. When/If you get into a 40/50% drawdown it's serious business, drawdown needs to be avoided at all costs. I'll backtest more/address more things tomorrow when the markets quite, gotta get PPZ charts updated for new trading day now, Regards, Jig

Has anybody a version of the BAT indicator which can be used with forextester ? (.dll file) I'd like to perform some 4h backtests.

I have just found this thread (A little late) but find it very intresting. I do want to start demoing it before I go live. I just have a quick question. Towards the start of the thread, other members as well a Team Aphid suggested going in with 5 lots, 2 at the break of the Bat line, 1 at the 61.8 retracement and 2 at the 38.2 retracement (Post #237 and #255). But then Team Aphid goes back to trading with 4 lots (only 1 lot traded at the break of the Bat line instead of 2.) If anyone is still trading this system, do you trade with 4 or 5 lots?

I have been following this for awhile. I am interested in applying this method with range bars to take out some noise. I'll keep you posted and maybe we can get this thread a jump start.

I believe the drawdown issue is completely resolvable. You are thinking too simplistically. You shouldn't be thinking in terms of lots. You should be thinking in terms of risk. That may mean that you trade with partial lots. Most places will allow you up as low as .01 lots and that's too much then you need a mini account and then you can trade with as little as .01 mini lot's. Now a .01 mini lot has a value of only one penny per pip on dollar based pairs. I hope you see that this isn't an issue.

I traded this a couple of years ago. It'll run you crazy with all the pending orders to keep up with and keep updated. You won't be able to do it without an EA, which I would not use.

MTF BAT ATR v2.mq4 - when using the time factor the plotting artifacts. Is there a fix? It is not repainting so much, but more plotting too early. ie. on a 1 min chart - set the idicator as a 5min - and change "closebase" to false. ie. so it becomes an indicator on touch and not on close. And the charting is everywhere. Maybe i need to try to change 'mediumprice' and 'mediumbase' at the same time???? The normal BAT ATR v2.mq4 is difficult to match to a higher timeframe. There is no workaround and you cant get a 1min plotting like the 5min or 15 min. Hence the need to have MTF BAT ATR v2.mq4 plotting properly and reliably. The one thing about this indicator is that you can have it "not on close". i.e. a signal is a signal. Just wish the MTF version would work properly for an EA.

I will definetly give this a try. It seems easy to manange with 0.01 lots. I'd like to hear from people that are currently using it or from people who left it behind (reasons).

Perhaps you could read/re-read this post "I traded this a couple of years ago. It'll run you crazy with all the pending orders to keep up with and keep updated. You won't be able to do it without an EA, which I would not use. " I think I may have read that Team Aphid started selling Avon or something like that. I dunno

this method is not profitable in the long run. and that is why team apphid abandoned it. it doesnt work unfortunately. team apphid are now using other methods, anyone wishing to try this method should be very careful and not have high hopes.

does anybody know what is the formula used for this indicator bat atr?

I also have some trouble to understand the logic behind this indicator. Unfortunatelly i don't programm in MQL4, maybe someone can help to understand this indicator. I mean, those lines are pretty straigh forward: CurrUp=Close[i] - (iATR(NULL,0,ATRPeriod,i) * Factor); PrevUp=Close[i-1] - (iATR(NULL,0,ATRPeriod,i-1) * Factor); CurrDn=Close[i] + (iATR(NULL,0,ATRPeriod,i) * Factor); PrevDn=Close[i-1] + (iATR(NULL,0,ATRPeriod,i-1) * Factor); as well as those: CurrUp=PriceLvl - (iATR(NULL,0,ATRPeriod,i) * Factor); CurrDn=PriceLvl + (iATR(NULL,0,ATRPeriod,i) * Factor); But the rest, and conditions are tougth to understand. Thanks in advance Alex
