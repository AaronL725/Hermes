What will be the effect of Daylight Saving Time on this method? London is currently on GMT but the clocks go forward 1 hour on March 29. Thanks

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Nothing will Happen just Modify the the BOX and Focus outside of it Attached Image (click to enlarge) +2GMT Attached Image (click to enlarge) ETC ......

--- 帖子 #5 ---
So basically, nothing to do with GMT, use the London market local open time Which is GMT unless BST is in effect Thanks

--- 帖子 #6 ---
That´s why most of Brokers Change servers to not be centered on the BOX and modify the (+) or (-) GMT depending on Your Broker Server Time https://www.forexmarkethours.com

--- 帖子 #7 ---
So you decided to start your own thread. (Truth be told I know people who would be so so so glad if Emmanuel7788 had done the same things years and years ago - but somehow it never happened...) Very good decision once again. Are you planning on looking at New-York-Open-BO as well? [And possibly this may also be of interest to you: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=985049 ] I will follow your development (and expect great things of you).

--- 帖子 #8 ---
So 2h hours before and 2 hours after Londen open?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks Josi KEEPING near to hear new things soon

--- 帖子 #10 ---
from 06-10 GMT just adjust your time depends on your broker time

Hi Emma, What's the rationale for the selected breakout of the high/low of the 2 hours before/after the London open? Are the results statistically better when compared to a breakout of the High/Low of ANY 4-hour period? Best, Dave

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi The box is from 6 to 10 GMT and you wait for a 1hr bar to close above/below the box, so the orders are placed at 11 GMT. Is this correct?

I trade GBP USD/ GBPJPY/USDJPY/EURJPY 08:00-12:00 On my brokers MT4 (+02GMT) that’s will be equal 06:00-10:00 GMT (1 hour before Frankfurt open 7 GMT +1 hour after London’s opening and closing of Asia The reacional is High &amp; Low already stablished by ASIA session and Frankfurt open at 07:00 &amp; London 08:00 Normaly price is voltaility on this Opening Time speacially at 09:00 GMT and buyer and seller are fighting on the Eurpean inicial balance I don´t want to give more details the most important is to simplicity and have rules and follow it Believe me works well just focus and trade out of it want more complicated and more indicators here in FF full of thread that´s have such so startegy the results statistically looks very nice if you follow my Money Management Style DIVIDE The risk and Cut loss and achieve the 50% to cut losses to 50%off Even i use the fixed Risk Each day you loss 100$ or Win 100$ per Trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image Attached Image Trade Outside the Box

Order placed win Complet the Setup Bar close above / Below when i Don´t know normally i check evey hour just 2 min before the close or set price alert when it hits make a sound so i look to chart and wait the candle to close if dosen´t close above or below i do nothing DOING NOTHING in Forex Trading is more than doing or taking bad decision depending on Technical Indicators overbought / oversold i just wait for the chance and the war between Buyer &amp; Seller Finish just i follow the winner

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Right. Wasn't asking about the inclusion of more indicators - I personally don't trade with indicators - but rather have you compared this 4-hr block with any other 4-hr block within the trading day to really determine the importance of this specific 4-hr time period? Buyers &amp; sellers are fighting throughout the day wherever the liquidity pools are- not just at some specific points during the day. And I wholeheartedly agree about having specific rules to trade by. But with that said, showing that your backtesting results (or forward testing) has a positive expectancy over a long period of time is a better argument to indicate that your system "works" rather than stating " Believe me works well" or showing 1 month of data. Not trying to be an ass but just asking about the research... This is an interesting idea and I'll need to put this on my backtesting "to-do" list... As always, best and good luck! Dave

Hi Emma, I am confused as to how you enter the trade. From what I understand you wait for a 1h bar to close outside the box, as long as it does not go beyond the 50% TP level? If so, isn't your R:R less than 1:1 per trade? Just trying to understand your method

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Without patience, you’ll fail as a trader. Don’t be a FOMO trader. Always wait for confirmation before entering a trade. Patience Is Also A Form Of Action – Auguste Rodin 1. Follow your trading plan 2. Wait for confirmation 3. Use Market , limit and stop orders 4. Use price alerts 5. Know yourself Other opportunities will always come along.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I still have a Question about the SToploss: Lets Say for Example we have an Valid Long (Buy) Entry. Then we put the Stoploss on the other site of the Box right ? Are we closing when price reach it or are we closing just when on the other site the Market has an h1 close ? And the other Question: You said you enter2 position is the one to take out at the 40% tp ? and the other goes to the 100% tp ? Or are the two orders just for the sl ? And as well do you let the trades open over night when either tp or sl hitted ?

You have really put a lot of effort into this, graphics and all! Well done!

just Google or even search here on FF for London Open Breakout Strategy’s they all use the first 2 hours of and from London open at 8 am local time (GMT or BST) this is basically the same except it takes into account the Frankfurt open, even 1 hour before that or you can search for Asian Breakout strategy, that uses the first 8, 9, 10 hours of the trading day INTERNET = INFORMATION don’t believe some random guys posts, learn for yourselves PS, shoot, forgot the rationales, pretty simple logic really, does anyone really have to ask that? That’s when trading starts, that’s when price moves, banks are putting in huge orders, traders are digesting the news, everyone is panicking, BUY BUY BUY , SELL SELL SELL

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Right. Thanks for your input Erebus... but let me tell you a secret, and without getting into a pissing match, ... I probably use the internet much more than you think...there have been several BO strategies described on FF over the years, and on other sites as well, and I have stats to show that the opening range BO is NOT necessarily the "best" out there.... But I wholeheartedly agree that the most profitable research is to learn for yourself... Best, Dave

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Is OK, but you know the last: "Big Ben Breakout Strategy" ? It is interesting and uses the first hour before the London Open.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hey, no problem matey, a lot depends on the traders own goals, for very short, intraday traders BO can be appealing. Myself, I am a BO traders, longer time scale, couple of days holding, as per the Monday Tuesday system. So probably not the place to discuss further your suggestion what to use if not BO...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi Emma, I think if you add 20pip below/above the box before open position, the winning rate might be higher. I trade GU mostly, and applied the technique. Cheers

--- 帖子 #28 ---

Hi. I love flicking through really clean threads here on FF. Your charts are very easy to follow and congratulations on discovering a method that works for you. There is always something new to learn if you enjoy learning and if it makes you money then that is nice, too. Would anyone have a simple "customisable" MT4 box indicator? I'm very interested in that little box but I would be using different times based on the way I trade. Cheers Anthony

I have tried looking at boxes and London bo before without success. I'll give this another try as I never linked them. Thank you for the idea.

Visualize. Practice visualizing the problem from different perspectives. This allows you to create space in the mind for a NEW reality. For example, if you climb to the top of the mountain and look out at the view in front of you, what do you see? The sky, the horizon, the valley below (as vague, tiny figures with no clarity) and you also see your immediate surroundings of trees, rocks, shrubs, whatever is around you. Now place yourself in the valley. Look around you now. What do you see? The tall mountain in front of you with its peak so far away you can’t see the individual rocks and trees. You see the sky from a further distance and maybe the clouds look smaller and less fluffy. Now your immediate surroundings; they are no longer tiny, indistinct things. They are full of detail and life. You see things you couldn’t possibly see from the top of the mountain. If you look at life’s problems in this same way, by visualizing yourself up close as well as far away from the problem, you can begin to see new things. You can see the details in a new way. You may find that things aren’t as they seem right now. Or you may find just the exact detail you need for your next step. You begin to open the mind to new details and new paths and perspectives.

An other Piece of this puzzle correlation between the various parities of the foreign exchange market. If the correlation is high (above 95) and positive then the currencies move in the same way. If the correlation is high (above 95) and negative then the currencies move in the opposite way. If the correlation is low (below 70) then the currencies don't move in the same way.

it’s simple just 06-10 am GMT RANGE BOX and each trade modify the GMT adjustable depending on brokre’s time 3 London Bo indicator it’s just to make it easier but if not we make the range manually high price / Low price =2 horizontal lines timing 06:00-11:59 =2 vertical lines

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I'm sorry if I changed the indicator a bit. I thought that maybe they are traders who don't know if one has to calculate the offset at the local time or at the server (= broker) time ...

Hi @Emma, just a little note regarding the times. If one use the "Happy Hours" indicator ( https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post12798027 ), you can see that statistically, regardless of GMT, the bar ranges (volatility) for this pair increase between 06:00 - 10:00, continue to increase until 17:00, and then decrease. Perhaps it is worth doing a comparative analysis of these statistically determined intervals with your intervals.

One can see that generally the box ranges are actually a bit smaller.

Appreciate that there was a candle close below the box in both cases, but my confusion was more about when you entered the trade. I'd assumed that the trade would be entered once the candle closed. For UJ, Sell trade was taken around 104.255, but the candle close was 103.803. With EJ the close was around 117.600, but the trade was entered at 118.080. Are there some rules around waiting for a pullback that I've missed ? The above relate to the pictures in Post 76 Thanks

for the guys who following everything. I trade exact to the rules. GBPJPY was okay to trade but we didnt got a retest of the low of the range. GBPUSD was also okay to trade as well here we didnt touchted the low excat on the low but it would be possible to get in there. GBPNZD was a signal as well. (but you maybe dont take it because you wanted to short already two gbp pairs so it might happen that the gbpnzd just makes a fake breakout) USDJPY still looking for the 1hour close above or below. And as well EMA is that a rule that you open a position at the close from the 1 our close ? because i see that in the most of your pictures Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I'm a little bit confused by these rules. Looking at the screenshots of your results, I only saw one sell limit in a huge midst of market sells, so I am confused. Ok, let's say the 1H bar closes above the range and it is not too close to the first TP level. We enter a market buy order when this bar closes above the range, understood. The TP of this order is set to half the range above the range, understood. Now, where does the buy limit come in? Once this market order has been placed, we now set a buy order at the top of the range and set TP for the same size as the range? What if the price shoots straight up and does not come back down to the top of the range to fulfil the order? Can we not just open two orders at the 1H close above the range and set one for 50% TP and one for 100% TP? If SL for a buy is at the 1H close below the range, the risk to reward ratio for both trades will be 2:1 (risk:reward) and 1:1 respectively, at best. Is this correct?

What about long trades. Are you leaving them for night time with BE/SL, or closing them at profit/loss?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi guys, I am adapting an EA to this method but I am blocking on one point. I generate a stop order at the top and another at the bottom of the channel; so far so good. But how can the order be executed only if the closing is done on the other side and not when the price crosses? there are certain things that I can do and much more that I cannot do :-)) this one by being part of it! the solution may be very simple ... If anyone can help me with this ... I will publish the EA here when it is functional. Thank you in advance...

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Not good at all because the candle has to close above/below the channel before the order is triggered. So why not use: Buy (or sell) if close price of H1-candle &gt; (or &lt;) upper (or lower) threshold.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi, Is it possible to add popup and push email alert when Buy or sell entry after closed the candle? Thanks

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thank you Josi but I had already tried and it doesn't work with the rest of the code; I may have gone in the wrong direction ... I think I have reached my threshold of incompetence ... lol ... In addition I find it hard to concentrate because I have a fever, maybe covid 19 ? -)) I pass the baton if someone can make it work according to the rules established here. Basically this EA was developed by sangui on this file: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=976730 I modified it so that it works according to the rules established here what it seems to do except for the order to pass only in the event of closing of the candle beyond the threshold; there will be someone competent to resolve this. Adjust the time of the correct period in the parameters according to your time zone. I put 5% beyond the range, you can change it. By displaying 0 for the stoploss, it is placed opposite the zone. By displaying 50 in TP, it will close the position well at 50% of the range. To have a second order at 100%, a solution is to place the EA on another graph with another magic number and 100 in TP. Good luck

Hello everyone There is an error in the EA published yesterday on lines 111 and 112. It is 1 and not 2 that must be put for the shift. Here is the corrected EA; please accept my apologies for my inattention. To visualize well on the screen after having made coincide the periods I put back the indicator "!!! - MT4 BREAKOUT BOX". No one has found a solution for the order to be executed only if the candle is closed above or below the level ?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi Emma, at very first i want to thank you for this cool system. It looks amazing. I have some questions. In you first Posting your Boxes are differs from your later postings. It confuses a lot. How you calculate 50% TP, when you enter on the closed 1 H Candle wich is near TP1.... It can't be 50% of the box range anymore, so when the trade go against you you loose 105 - 130% ... did you respect that in your Backtesting? Often the trade don't retrace back to the breakout box and that don't give you chance to enter with the second Limit order of the second half of your busket for TP2 . In this case you gain just &gt;50% in this trade but can loose 100% and more in the sesond. How do you handle this and calculate this?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi emm, Thz for yr trading plan.I just want to suggest exit plan. In term of Pips, when price reach Tp1 (50% of box), our entry 1 is close and tp2(same size of box) entry 2 close. lets say box size is 50 pip&gt;&gt;&gt; tp1 is 25 pip and tp2 is 50 pip..We booked 25 pip if we hit tp1 and 50 pip if tp 2 hit. But in terms of Dollar amount, it is not the same like u calculated in pips. If we risk 50$ each trade and divided into 2 entry&gt;&gt; 25$ each &gt;&gt;eg .box size is 50pip and we trade 0.1 lot each trade. IF Tp1 hit&gt;&gt;we r not getting 25$(although pip is 25 pip) we only get 12.5$ If tp 2 hit&gt;&gt; altough 50 pip for tp2&gt;&gt;.we get only 25$.. If we both hit TP1+tp2&gt;&gt;&gt;we get 37.5$.. IF we hit FUll SL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; we lose 50$ So, our risk:reward is 1:0.75. I wanted to point out is if we lose 2 streak in a row, we need 3 full Tp to recover that loss. In terms of pips calculation, the numbers are good. But in terms of Dollar $, we would be struggle to get consistency if losing streak are kick in. May i know yr suggestion Emma??? Regards, Ice

New version "3Tier London Breakout V.5.0-GMT" Hello, Emma, I have installed in indicator a "proprietary" signal filter. If you have time, one can test whether some wrong trades can be avoided. (On D1, the close of the previous day will be compared with the pivot and middle of the bar, as well as the smash bars. Further details are now unimportant).

Of course! If the indicator is applied and no comment is posted in the thread, the indicator will only deliver wrong trend signals after 99 applications ...

--- 帖子 #227 ---
LOL yes... thanks my friend and wait a moment I will make a comment...as every indicator also that indi is a trade-off, it will avoid good trades as well, if applied by an EA, for instance!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
With the interpretation you are right, you can not sell the idea on and become rich without you including me, even if it is "not" a patent. But if you take my formulation so strictly ("the producer has set restrictions on use"), you cannot use the indicator either, and I will miss your analyzes ...

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Yes, I know that some good trades are missed. In principle, this is not a problem, because with a DashBoard one gets enough trading opportunities every day. I don't have much time to test, and before I started programming a DB I wanted to see if the idea was okay. In principle, good trades are confirmed, but you also have to determine how many bad trades have been avoided. With 28 pairs, one should not trade all daily and be able to make a reasonable selection.

The new indicator looks great! Even tho the market is closed it shows much better the idea. No excess information. Better TP! Keep up the great work guys! Stay GREEN $!

Hello @Emma 7788-FAN thank you for opening this interesting thread. I like to use this boxing method because it is clear and simple via "Daily LineBoxes" with thanks to @hanover in H4.

Dear SwingMan, would you please check what caused the box to be mistakenly expanded last Thursday (under the red line)? Many thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #233 ---
As far as I can see the "proprietary signal filter". cannot be turned off (only by setting colours to none). That's a bit unlucky - especially if one already uses a "proprietary signal filter" of one's own. Maybe this false/true-option can be implemented in possible future versions.

Then use the previous version, is the same.

Hey Emma, thank you for sharing your strategy. I'm still a little confused about the entries, maybe you or someone else can help me. So if a Bar closes below the Box and isn't too close to the 50% tp do I immediately open the first Trade and set an Pending Order at the Low of the Box or do I set two Pending Orders at the Low of the Box and wait for them to be executed? Hope someone coul help me with this. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #238 ---
If I understand properly Bar closes below the box -&gt; open sell market order and place a sell limit order @ Low Box Bar closes above the box -&gt; open buy market order and place a buy limit order @ High Box Stop @ opposite box side

So if I do as you suggest, do I set the TP of the market Order at the 100% TP and the pending order at 50% TP?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
This is what I see in the first post 1- BUY position with Take Profit at 50 of The range of the BOX within SL loss if any 1H BAR Close Below the BOX . 2- Set a Buy limit Order at the high of the BOX with a Take profit same pips of the BOX and SL Loss if any 1H BAR Close Below the BOX.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi, Thanks for sharing this strategy. Do you ever find that if you have a losing trade on GJ, you have a losing trade on GU on the same day? Or do they appear to work differently? I've also been looking at the 8am-9am 1 hour bar (UK time). If you trade the break of this, it seems to yield good results too. I've tried it on GU, GJ, EU and Gold. If one side breaks and fails, the other side will usually bring in the pips. I would move on if the trade has failed twice on one day (so if long and short both fail, try again tomorrow).

Understand. Btw yesterday GU has made TP1-2. Anyone has stat about this setup when box range &gt; 150 but made the tp?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Should be two reasons. 1: box range is &gt; 150 2: Breakout bar is near the TP1. But I dont think box range is the reason why dont trade at that moment, because the box range is unlimited( my personal thought ). we never know the what exactly true range is. I am just saying

first of all Thanks a lot for your great job i like GU &amp; EG looks perfects but to look behind the chart and backtesting there is a big correlations between each analising the grafic going together up &amp; down https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...1#post12841411 that´s why i like GU &amp; EG the correlation is interesting even back testing Thanks @jarin9

There are some bugs in EA, I'll fix and upload.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Have you noticed that a lot of big moves happen when the 9am bar starts? Might be a good to make the box 6am, 7am, 8am (3 hours), and trade the break of the box with the 9am bar. Don't wait for it to close. Enter the trade as it breaks the box. Just a thought.

Is it something that prove to be more profitable to keep the trades running until TP or SL?

New version "TradeOutsideTheBox v6.0" This version is a continuation of the existing version "3 Tier London Breakout V.5.0-GMT" In the meantime I have adapted the code to the TOTB strategy of @Emma7788-FAN , and I might make some changes later, which is why I have also changed the name.

Hi, what is the improvement over 3 Tier London Breakout 5.0? Could you little bit explain? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
New version "TradeOutsideTheBox v6.1" There is now a parameter in the new version: "EntryLimit_Factor = 0.25" If the close of a bar is within the limit, you can trade. ( - The changes that are made in the source code are programming problems, and maybe I'll make mistakes until everything is tested. - Please do not send PMs for programming help because I don't have time for new projects. )

I think the problem is the end of session time. If at your timezone the London session starts at 5:01, then end of day at 20:00. I think the auto GMT doesn't need to set true.

Hi SwingMan, I'm testing the indicator (thank you very much for your work), but is this hour setting correct? That setup seems to start right at the open of London, not 1 hour before the open... The idea of the Box is between 1 hour before London session to 1 hour after Asian session, right? Maybe, if possible, can you upgrade the indicator with a stop loss line, that works over percentage of box? This is helpfull to put an order. Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi Swingman if possible in next version could you add popup &amp; push alert. Great work thanks..

--- 帖子 #316 ---
- Level Resize Factor can not be 500! 1.0 or 1.2 would be OK. - I have a "zero divide" message on DE30 and have to correct it

--- 帖子 #317 ---
- The hours are GMT, we have an option to Auto calculate or no the offset, and you can set or test your broker GMT offset. - "Over percentage of box" please check the parameter "LevelResizeFactor" I only adjusted the existing "3 Tier London Breakout" indicator so that I didn't test all the original functionalities.

So far I have not seen any trading examples where the indicator would be helpful, so I see no advantages for alerts ...

I'm trading manually my own strategy and hence also do following my own rules. When you always copy what others do...it gets very difficult to become successful IMHO! You must find the rules which fit to your trading style/time/risk bearing. My daily goal is 100 EUR per day with 1:1 risk on 7-10 trades , trying to be in the market as short as possible during these chaotic times. I'm trading mostly on M30 timeframe und exit positions on a Close-All script or a separate EA too. That is also the answer to "armaros".

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I am not copy your positions. This thread is about TOTB strategy. If you share a pic about your closed trades, many member here imagine that your trades were following this thread strategy. Including exit rules. That's why I asked trailing stop. So please don't mix TOTB and your own strat on same picture. Deceptive. Thx.

Hi @Emma7788-FAN, Im also on those same pairs you're trading today BUT my time is shifted 1hour behind, but I am following the rules you stated on post #1 can you confirm your marks are in line with the GMT?

@ emma7788-fan why have you not adjusted your trading box times, europe and london are now in day light saving GMT+1 so do you not need to move your box to start from 7am instead of 6am ?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
yes, but London open is 1hr later regardless of gmt, so you should have changed the gmt offset in swingmans indicator, otherwise (as in your charts) your box is covering 2hrs before Frankfurt open. i changed mine this morning as im in london, as my broker is now london open +2 instead of +3 due to daylight saving, so both euro and london are opening 1hr later. So now my charts show different to yours. it looks like you have not changed gmt offset or box start time. as per 1st post, box needs to start 1hr before euro open, please check. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
You are probably right, but from the +2, +3 etc. I understand that I have to calculate the offset, and that is too difficult for me. If the offset changes and I sleep, everything is wrong! Therefore with MT4 you can read in the server (broker) time and the GMT time, and subtract them. This creates the calculated GMT offset = 3 hours (in Germany). Here is a current comparison of the program values and the GMT-Greenwich time. Where is the mistake? In any case, one may not deduct the local time from the broker time. Then the offset would actually be 1 hour (in Germany)

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thanks guys I am not using MT4 I was coding the indicator on cTrader and noticed that different even though my time is right offset with summer time. either way I manage to make the indicator similar to @SwingMan, all credits to this fantastic gentleman, what I did was not as complex as his indicator, is basicaly a box wrapping the opening candles and a fibo with targets, I still need to add the text on lines not sure how to do it yet but I will get there eventually, here is a peak.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi Swingman, i dont see any issue with your indicator, its great and it works fine and we can all adjust the time to suite our broker. once gmt offset is set, thats it, finished. but once London open changes we need to move the start time and finish time of box. I was just pointing out that leaving everything as it was on Friday causes an issue this week because London and Europe opens 1hr later so we need to take that into account. Broker gmt offset is still the same, just London/European open has moved.

For your better understanding...my trading is based on the TOTB strategy and I do appreciate the OP's work and also SwingMan's support explicitly! I only made small adjustments according to my ideas and desires. That' all and nothing special. I also say thanks to OP for his understanding. I know that is not always naturally. Moreover I think no rules are set in stone for ever. BTW, I'm a fan of emmanuel7788 too! Happy trading, jdva

I don't understand why we always trade 06.01 : 09:59 GMT. London opens @ 8 GMT+1 instead of last week 8 GMT, so the big money flow comes 1 hour later in GMT terms. Why don't we condiser this?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi pedrobhs - about cTrader, I also have one pepperstone acct running on ctrader - I checked the ctrader community and although there is a large amount of indicators I could not find a box style indi.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Great question, been asked before https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...2#post12797422 OP says trade GMT , nothing to do with when markets trade!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Why ask so many? Because @Emma decided so, see #Post 1! @nihilist wrote also: "but once London open changes we need to move the start time and finish time of box." Why should we change the start time? I have recommended several times to use my "Happy Hour" indicator, which statistically determines the hourly volatility. If one does that, everyone has the opportunity to choose a favorable interval for "his" broker, regardless of GMT.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Not everyone needs an indicator to tell them that volatility will be higher when the market is open than when it is closed, it's called COMMON SENSE

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hi Swingman Thank you for all.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
As always young man, you're right, but I need something like that! I cannot know as quickly as you that on March 8th the lowest volatility was at 06:00, and today on April 1st at 07:00. These are brokerage times, so if I have for my unbeatable system an entry at this time, I know that the volatility increases and does not fall as at 17:00. For me it is important that I do not have to think about whether and which market is open or closed at 7:00 a.m., whether daylight saving time is, where I live or what is happening in London. It may also be that my Australian broker has different dates for the Australian platform in Sydney than the English platform in London. No idea.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Great explanation Swingman...we can never know to much information. That is how we learn. Thanks for your valued inputs for I don't know how many years. Appreciated by many.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
So I have made an EA for this system, its still not ready for any kind of live trading. I'm attaching it here for the group to test out and hopefully provide feed back to improve. The time should range should be calculated automatically, let me know if its now There are 2 main methods to open trades, Placing pending ordered at the top and bottom of the box As soon price reaches the high or low it will open that position and delete the opposite position TP is set at 1x box range SL, will be triggered if bar opens beyond the opposite Limit There is a fail safe SL, should be larger than box range Waiting for the candle to close above below the box TP is set at 1x box range SL, will be triggered if bar opens beyond the opposite limit There is a fail safe SL, should be larger than box range max pt outside box is the % of the range that the bar will close beyond the range to open a trade, so if it is set to 0.5 that would be equal to the TP1 value Current issues: If SL is triggered, should an opposite trade be permitted? no partial close

--- 帖子 #352 ---
If you can follow OP's rules precisely with patience you should be able to make money with this method especially during these volatile times. But as always note: No gain without pain! I'm mainly a ultra shortterm impatient trader hence I'm trying to make profits very quickly. Therefore I try to take advantage of the breakout momentum as early as possible. So I'm watching all 28 pairs and make most entries on M30 close outside the range. That may be sometimes dangerous and because of it I cannot recommend to do it...if you do not have good experience in technical analysis and pattern recognition. You have to find the daily trend with SwngMan's indicators, for instance. Also you should have a certain feeling for the markets/pairs which I'm unable to describe. If feeling wrong on entries I exit them at once. Therefore my method is very discretionary ant not suitable for everyone. Moreover I have a daily goal of 100 EUR with 1:1 risk and a hit rate of 70-80%. If achieved that daily target I exit all positions and enjoy the day. I don't want to mislead people by my strategy/method and do expressly recommend OP's strategy and rules which are successful as well! Good luck, jdva

--- 帖子 #353 ---
you are correct, volatility clearly starts at market open, and in post 1 it clearly states, 1hr before European open, op charts now no longer show this because adjustments have not been made. ive adjusted mine and i will be trading from original box time set, 1hr before Eu open, this makes more sense to me.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Nice work. I will be testing. Many thanks for your input and contribution.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I think the box should always have been the way it is right now. 3 hours before UK open and only 1 hour after UK open. All the big moves usually start happening after 9am UK time and the box is set to take full advantage of these movements now. That's my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi @jdva, With your own expierence with TOTB, have you made a statistic of the pairs that have achieved the most times the TP? thx

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I have also made an EA today, been testing it on EG and EA, with slightly different rules: I use a 1:1 TP /SL, based on volatility (ATR). Reason is, depending on where the candle closes, the SL at bottom of box (for a long trade) makes the R:R really skewed, sometimes risking 1 to gain 0.35 for example. I set the open order function only at the open of the candle, like the initial rules (so not a pending order like you suggested). Also, another filter I added is a limit of 4 hours before a trade is triggered. It just makes more sense to me in this way, to get away from PA stalling in the box too long. Anyway, on both pairs the results were convincing for the last quarter, especially EG, really consistent growth. So I made the exact same backtest on both pairs, for 2018: - EURGBP: -18.6% (-1861€ on a 10k account), 36.7% WR, 68 trades. - EURAUD: -15.8% (-1587€ on a 10k account), 37.9% WR, 58 trades. So seems nice in the short run, but you get rekt in the medium / long term. I know a lot of people don't like when you demonstrate that an idea has ultimately a negative expectancy, but I'm just sharing my results for those that are interested. If you do get a rising equity curve slope, please share what settings or rules you used, we can compare 2018 like that. And if you don't get a PF&gt;1, please also share as it might save some people a lot of time doing research / manual backtesting for nothing. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Why are you sharing this screenshot? Looked at the trades and it has nothing to do with the method described here, so what's your point?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Some did others did not, he shared with other system thread too, maybe he's into profit porn

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I haven't had good long term testing with my setup yet. If you read my post again, you'll see that I have two methods, one is based on the candle open the other is pending orders. I believe SwingMan added a filter to his indicator, from observation it could be Ichimoku based, Could anyone confirm?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Yeah never mind, I checked his profile and he just spammed this screenshot randomly on different threads. He got insta-removed from Davit's thread with the exact copy-paste message. And those types of posts are completely useless, they bring nothing to the discussion, especially when the entries - exits have nothing to do with the thread.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Yes I know, that's why I specified that I only used the initial entry rules, unlike you. Although I thought about using pending orders at some point, but for now just stuck with the original rules, at least for that. Would you mind sharing your results for, say, 2018 like I did, just to compare &amp; discuss, and maybe build on different experiences? Also if the results aren't "good", it's especially important to share so that other people can have an idea of the outcome of the system. Just a suggestion as I like sharing ideas and experimenting, especially when a system isn't working.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I have here https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...1#post12829371 briefly mentioned that after the first enthusiasm it would be good to have a directional filter, because the market energies do not move brownian, but according to patterns we do not know. - The position of daily open opposite the pivot and the middle of the previous bar is very simple and powerful. - One can then also take the presence of a smash bar (Close over previous bar). These two filters favor long or short trades, and do not consider them to have the same winning chance.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Thank you SM! can you clarify a bit on the mid of previous bar; is it the day open posit of previous day Middle point? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #368 ---
For the current day, the pivot range consists of the distance between the calculated pivot of the previous bar and the middle of this bar. (Shift=1). This zone acts as resistance or support for the price developments of a day, because the traders play their games during the day, then go to sleep etc. Only the EAs have to work ...

The filters are On/Off only and you can chose which one you want, if all filters are off then the EA will trade when 1hr candle closes outside box but inside max pct outside box value and if the previous 4 1HR bars do not break the max pct value. Updated with lot size fix

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Thank you for providing a practical optimisation lesson.

New version "TradeOutsideTheBox v7.0" Two new parameters requested by some members : For @mrafzal : "BoxOffset_Pips = 0" or other values. For @Isabella_D : " Show_TradingLevels_Text = true" or false .

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Thanks. I've been looking for and asking for an EA with the option to open at a close within a range outside the box for ages! Great. Will test this now.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I want to request the following adjustment. Total 9 levels. Based on these levels, I want to specify two orders for each direction. Based on backtests 2020. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
TOTB looked to "rock" when the markets were going COVID crazy. Last week, not so much. The fundamental flaw for using long-term is that winners are consistently smaller than losers, which ultimately relies on an unrealistically high win percentage. All of the OP's profit projections assume entry at the break of the box, but the method calls for entry at the end of the hour that closes beyond the box. As other have pointed out, this results in R:R of less than 1:1. And while I really appreciate the efforts of Swingman on the template, for me at least, it is very buggy. From one day to the next it never opens up and looks the same. Probably something on my end, but irritating. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
yes think this is true as its not working well for hourly close outside the box. I wanted an EA for a 15min timescale and trade taken at first close outside the box at a % of the range for a 4hr box size. Also able to set SL at say 50% of the box range and TP at 100% of the range.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
A strategy I've been testing with promising results (and could use help coding, so to backtest). divide total risk % into three positions. Set SL to one pip plus spread outside of box. Then set tp @ 161.8% 261.8% and 423.6% of box When price reaches the 161.8% mark move one sl to B/E and the other to 38.2% to be in a free trade. Then if price retraces and closes the position @ b/e, move the other positions tp down to 161.8% If price were to continue to tp @ 261.8% then move remaining sl to 161.8% The box time I have been using is 2330-0130gmt taking advantage of a Tokyo fix beak. On EURJPY Using 15m close outside and entering only within 3pips of break. I feel this mm strat w/ fibs would offer higher realized potentials w/ any breakout time. As it offers 5 possible outcomes, only one if which is a loss. Again, I need more data to verify. @ 4% risk the 5 results are about : -4% 0% 1% 2.5% 5.5% Thur ~ 2.5% and Fri b/e I find the most trouble being human error and inability to execute in proper timing. Looking back over the past year it looks good, but executing in real time and figuring in transaction costs has had it's challenges for me.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Thats the type of BO I was posting about and have seen similar trade management also discussed. 80% sure it would work. Maybe this EA could be altered to allow it for 15min candles and a box across the time. I think i was trying 2200 - 0200gmt then a trade on the first if any 15min candle to close within a certain max pips or % range of the box pips.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
The EA have the range hard coded to use the 1hr bar for the but if you change the TF to 15min it will trade on the close of the 15min bar

--- 帖子 #400 ---
"Show_TradingLevels_Text = true" or false. oh thank you @Swingman. I hope the Easter Bunny comes to you soon Attached Image

Hi guys, i have been following this post and the strategy looks interesting, i have back-tested this TOTB system for the last quarter and its a little bit good. though an new to trading can someone in the house give me instructions on how to get a chart history for previous quarters in 2019 to further back-test this indicator as my broker can only provide a chart data history for this first quarter of 2020

Nice Indicator. I have 2 questions. For example, if I trade the London session that means my box should be 4 hours before the London opening? Secondly is there any chance to add an alert when the prices break the box?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
No. I think you need to read the thread.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Of course, this does not mean it is a constantly winning method. It could be market conditions were very good (I think they were), and also the way I handled the trades.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Massive thanks to Swingman for the excellent work on the indicator ! evolving very nicely, well done.

Hi Emma, Your open is 3 hours before mine.. Are these your standard settings and I need to change them? Thanks a lot..

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi Emma, several members would like to have a dashboard for the indicator. Here is one of the texts: "I was wondering if you could implement desktop and push notifications when price closes above/below the box? I don't have time to check the charts all day, even though I could just check charts every hour but alerts would make things way easier. Maybe if possible to get alerts only when price closes 50% of the way between the edge of the box and TP1." Because I don't do private programming, please describe if and how you would have alerts and a dashboard, and maybe I can do something in the next few days.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
How long have you got? Seriously I apply some common sense to the method. In a strong uptrend I would not allow the short side. If we are trading inside yesterday's range I would be careful about risk. I set 1 : 1, 3 : 1 and 10 : 1 trades, moving my stop loss to BE +1 after 1 : 1 hits. Stuff like that. Sometimes I will close at a smalll loss if there isn't enough movement/momentum. I find Thursday is best? Not sure why.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
hello Emma, you are using different settings. As u see attached, u were using GMT 3, now GMT 0. Of course if u change it, the result would be different. (so u share more positive trade but with different settings and different entry candle). After 22 page and with new automatic indicator, would be great to have clear this point.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I am just wondering that during 3/11/2020- 4/9/2020 you have changed time box 4 times. (based on my broker: hotforex Winter: GMT+2, Summer: GMT+3) 3/11 7-10 (HF broker) 3/18 8-11(HF broker) 3/30 9-12(HF broker) 4/9 6-9(HF broker) Do you use several broker to trade? I am just confused. Thank you

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Lol You have same questions of mine.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Yep..! But I think is the most important bz with different time, we have different trade.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Yep! He mentioned that he is using GMT+3 which is same broker server time of mine, but use different time bz of mine... and also changed 4 times... I just need answer..

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Same broker here! GMT +3 settings the chart is attached. We have different entry.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
set GMT +2, if broker has GMT +1 there is the difference. First caldle start at 8 AM? You need to set your indicator with two hours before the London session begins. Just adjust.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
The one you attached is same as my setting.. But When I check his chart... different entry

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Love the images. Fantastic...

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Well I didn't mean any private coding I just didn't wan't to spam the thread with this issue. By all means if you decide to add alerts make it public. Anyway here is an example of yesterday NO alert and today's alert that we should get. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But you already have something like this implemented you have red/green circle for confirmed trade and a blue skull for no trade. What rules does this icons follow? Maybe just add alerts to whatever you are using and it's done.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Emma, it is correct that last 2 days your box is drawn 3 hours earlier...take look - shaded box is what we been working with for the past few weeks, box between two lines is what you are displaying last 2 days. Perhaps you are not aware of it.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
In #Post 258, version 6.1 ( https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...8#post12845638 ) I wrote a short explanation. You might see that I'm just trying to program Emma's recommendations. There are many other ideas and possibilities and I don't want to spend too much time on them. For this reason, I also wrote that Emma should write his opinion about a DB because some members in PMs suggested it, and especially for alerts, and that's a good thing. Actually I am working on another interesting idea related to Box Breakouts, maybe also in combination with Darvas Boxes, so that I could have little time to program further functionalities.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Thats why so confused... I dont know which box should I follow ...

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I foretold these time dilemmas way back in Post 3 Why anyone is fixated on GMT is a puzzle to me The answer is so simple Just say draw the box 1 hour before London market opens Market opens at 8 am all year long, DST on and DST off Frankfurt opens 1 hour before London, makes sense to me It’s not rocket science

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I see you are having a. Last with GMT questions across multiple threads

--- 帖子 #454 ---
If you can't understand the Time Space Continuum, how can you expect to be able to trade?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Personally I don't work in time domain, I use the Laplace transform to work in the S domain; no GMT there!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Well I hope you find time to code in alerts into your existing visuals that you implemented in version 6.1

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I think the best way to build the box is placing London open in the middle of it. So the box starts from 6 London time and ends 9.59 London time , each and every day, no matter of GMT or GMT+2, DST bla bla bla. I seem it works well.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
you have to changed box when you think it can changed. forex price changed. you need to think where you can changed your box .. look for patterns like H&amp;S , triple tops , triangles. if it is trend then follow it.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
The problem is the way the explanation was where the box should be. It would be way more simple if we would know how many hours before London open we should draw the box. Because London open starts all year at the same time, so you just adjust the box when time savings comes 2x a year. @Emma7788-FAN can you once and for all finish this doubts about the box. How many hours before London open should we draw the box? Is it 2h or 1h or?

--- 帖子 #461 ---

Ok, so I've refined my EA that gave me the results I posted earlier in this thread. I adjusted the money management rules, because initially I was just going with a single unit, and a 1:1 R/R. This time, just as the rules state, I have 2 units (one for each TP), with a 0.5% risk on each unit (so risking 1% per trade). Just to give an idea, here are what the results would be for this week, on the 3 pairs mentioned on the first page (GU, GJ, UJ): - RESULTS GBPUSD FOR PAST WEEK: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) - RESULTS GBPJPY FOR PAST WEEK: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) - RESULTS USDJPY FOR PAST WEEK: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) So overall a pretty meh week, averaging -0.3R over those 3 pairs.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Following my analysis for what the results would be for the current week, by following exactly what the rules state on the first page of this thread, I decided to backtest for the whole year of 2019, on both GBPUSD and GBPJPY. Again, through my EA just following the rules: break of the box, 2 targets, moving SL to BE when half the target is reached, etc... So, what would have been the results if you followed exactly that strategy through 2019? - RESULTS GBPUSD 2019: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) - RESULTS GBPJPY 2019: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see (and not very surprisingly), in both cases the equity curve is sloping down, in other words it's a losing strategy. (Same goes on other pairs BTW). Let's have a look at a portion of the GU curve, where it takes a deep dive around half way: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's what it looks like on the chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see, it's simply 6 consecutive losses, where price breaks out of the box, to finally go the other way without even reaching the first TP. A few times it gets real close, but that's just the reality of trading. So you might think, well 6 losses isn't the end of the world, and of course it isn't. Any strategy will have losing streaks, and here I just picked an example out of 115 trades for the year. Which brings me to the reason its expectancy is negative: The biggest weakness of this strategy is it's money management. More specifically, it's R:R ratio. I've hinted at it in a previous post, but nobody has pointed it out, so here it is in graphical terms: Attached Image (click to enlarge) A typical trade: Price has broken out of the box, so good for a long. But what many don't realise, is that you risk 60 pips to make 20 pips!! That's for the first unit of the trade, for the second you risk the same 60pips to make 45pips. So in an ideal trade where you enter at the top of the box (which never happens), you get AT BEST 0.75R (let's say you risk 1%). Again, that never happens because the entry is always above / below the box, so the actual best case is actually less than that. When it goes just to TP1, you get 0.25R . When you lose, you get -1R. So even with a positive winrate (GU has around 60% in 2019), you still lose money. And that's money management 101, but for some reason people don't like to point out the obvious. My thoughts are, if you were to make this strategy actually successful in the long run , you have to tweak the SL / TP rules, or else it just doesn't work.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Barraka, check your PM

--- 帖子 #471 ---
You therefore only have to reverse the orders as well as the TP in SL and SL in TP but you will have to subtract the spread multiplied by the size of the positions multiplied by the number of orders and the final result will also be ... negative ... and back to square one !

@SwingMan Have you considered that you would implement alerts for your red/green circle? I and I'm sure a lot of other members would greatly benefit from alerts. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
New Version "TradeOutsideTheBox v7.1" OK, I tried to program the alerts a few days ago Unfortunately I haven't had the time to test properly and I think there are still some problems. Please test and report if there are bugs.

I was always a fan of fibo levels (knowing that most bank programs use them as well). Here is another great example from today: Attached Image ..cannot be coincidence...

--- 帖子 #490 ---
All alerts work like a charm. I'm using M15 for entry. It's just this happened a few times today that I get two alerts candle after candle. If you could fix this, other than this it works great. Good job.

thx @SwingMan for v7.1 could you please change parameters for signal? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I don't understand what you mean, but I suppose that you mean the cross. The author recommends the open after the close. One can make a switch in the program and no private changes, other than the author used. Something like this: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...9#post12878479

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Thanks for the observation! It is not easy to correct the bug, but it is not bad to draw your attention twice when you fell asleep ...

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Thanks Swingman, the addition of the position sizing calculation is a great addition. this indicator is nearly perfect, Whats the chances this can be made into an EA in the near future as it seems to have everything it needs?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
But you have @jado's EA https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...8#post12858138

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Yes, but the position size calculation per trade for an ea would be awesome and its all there in the indicator ready to go. All I know is forward testing using the indicator has been very positive so to get exact same results from an ea built on this indicator makes total sense. What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
If so, the easiest way for me is that @jado implement money management in the EA...

--- 帖子 #498 ---
My Stop loss is a fail safe fixed value, the EA will close the trade automatically when a bar closes on the opposite side of the box. How is the risk calculated now? No one came back with positive feedback from the EA testing yet.. why not try that first before worrying about lot size. Also, guys I'm not a programmer by trade I'm an EE who like to program and no where near what SM can do

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Position/Risk size will be important for the success of this EA. it will need to be implemented as OP has stated. This needs to be traded across at least 5 pairs so you cant be trading same lot size on different pairs with varying box size. No point in winning 5 trades and one big loss will wipe all the gains out. Risk needs to be managed and Swingman's calculation works well and forward testing has been positive so far. Maybe you guys could collaborate or share code between you. You have both done great work, just needs bringing together. wish I could program, total respect to both of you.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
SM, Would you share the equation for the lot calculations and I'll do my best to implement.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I mean alert concerning the boxline (upper or lower). Signal via indicator is too late. I would prefer signal exatly at BoxLine. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Here is the naked source code for version 7.1 where I removed my test lines. Now I am trying to solve the problem of double alerts, but I have not yet succeeded.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
New Version "TradeOutsideTheBox v7.2" @Degolep made this statement: "It's just this happened a few times today that I get two alerts candle after candle." I think that I fixed this bug. When I test the indicator in the StrategyTester, a NO signal appears at the beginning of the boxes, and I have so far been unable to correct this error. Please report whether this or other problems appear in live trading.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Added risk based lot size, this EA works on Demo and Backtesting only.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Why have you restricted ea to only work on demo Please ?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Works fine, good job. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
It need to be tested and proven out before i remove that restriction.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hi, ea lots size percentage not calculating properly, also ea tp is tp2 can we not use tp1 ?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi Swingman, can you check version 7.2 please... seems the lots/risk calculation not working correctly. older version 6.2 is fine.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
For such comments please add an example/chart with the calculation, otherwise I can not determine which error can be. It would be even better and desirable to post the correct calculation!

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Thanks Swingman, im not near my computer till Monday, will send then. If you have time before then just run version 6.2 and 7.2 with same set file on same pair and see what a huge difference between lots size calculation. For a rough example, v6.2 was showing 0.63 lots and 7.2 was showing something like 7.2 lots that was on USDJPY v6.2 being correct. Will send images on Monday, Enjoy your weekend.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
That's a good idea! In principle, the same function is used for the calculation in both versions ...

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Jado911, thanks for the EA, which I am testing at the moment. I used the default settings last week on several pairs, but the ea started only one (audusd), dont know why. I changed the default time to start the box to 6.00 as per the thread’s first post (should be ok, as I am in the UK), but maybe I should also move the “Hr to start trading” to 11 as well?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Thanks for your hint, it was useful! Because the indicator was not programmed directly by me, when I make changes I sometimes overlook the original logic and this is how the bugs arise. I have made some adjustments for the alerts in "Version 7.2.1" . Please test if there are any new bugs ... --------------------------- I added three new parameters for the display of the charts (Background, Foreground, OHLC) so that one can draw the charts standard. color Chart_Background=clrWhite; color Chart_Foreground=clrBlack; bool Chart_ShowOHLC =false;

I will post the source code of the indicator "TradeOutsideTheBox v7.2.1" just for you. Lines 870 and 884 contain the correct formula (in which I found the bug today), for calculating the lot number.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Thanks, I got mine fixed now. I still need to figure out how to close half the position at TP1 as requested before I upload it again.

Nice work Swingman, seems to be working lovely at the moment. Thanks very muck for your effort. Jado911 Is it possible once you have solved or solving issue on the ea, to leave us an option in settings so ea closes closes full lots at tp1 ?? Ive been trading like this for the month with positive results using swingmans indicator. I know the risk reward argument is against it but proof so far is the hit rate far outways the losses so would be nice to use the ea to catch the closes when im a sleep. Thanks for your work and effort.

Ok I think I got it, by default it will open 2 position at half the calculated lot size, with TP1 and TP2 as targets. Break even is enabled for this option only if you set "TP at TP1 only = true" it will open one position at the full calculated lot size and close it at TP1 as always thanks to swingman for his work and offering help.

Doe is open position in back testing? anyone else have the same issue? change pct out box to be &gt;0. if it is set to 0 you are telling the EA to open a trade if the bar opens exactly at the box.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Lovely, thank you, missed that completely ! Also, could you explain please, if we want risk at 1% do we need to put in 0.01 in percentage field ? if i place 1.0% its opening 7+ lots. Also is it based on account balance or equity ? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
1% risk is entered as 0.01 , lot size will be determined based on the box size 1% risk on $1,000 is 10$ but again the EA does not exit a losing trade unless a bar closes on the opposite side so the loss will be more than 10$

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Not sure the ea is calculating the lots size correctly compared to indicator. Indicator has my account balance placed in settings, shows 1% at 0.10 and ea settings percentage set at 0.01 and its took trade at 0.05

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I'm sure you can figure out how to reduce that, let us know it the EA preformed and I'll take a look when I get a chance.

--- 帖子 #528 ---

--- 帖子 #532 ---
EA Took to rouge trades today, one on gbpusd and one on gbpjpy No idea why, all settings can be seen on picture and magic numbers are different for all pairs. trades occurred outside of set hrs. I closed manually. hope this helps you find the bug. thx.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Its possible make an Expert Advisor when the box its broken (after hours) open a trade with the TP1 and TP? its so good for backtests

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Please ignore this, had a gremlin in my mt4 platform which i think caused the issue. Sorry for any trouble.

TOTB is an interesting trading system. I'm not sure how to use it. Is there a manual for it or can someone explain how to use?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
on this page it explains how it works, nihilist23uk ( https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=985026 )

--- 帖子 #537 ---
interesting observation, Only looked at a few pairs but the success rate of when the price hits tp1 that it will go on to tp2 is very high. Wonder if a modified ea exactly the same but opening at tp1 with target of tp2 might be worth considering. Have not had time to go right into this yet so if someone else could take a look as well and see if it has any legs. That using a box that starts at 1hr before Frankfurt.

[quote = jado911; 12906714]修复了在框{file} [/ quote]的相对侧闭合时，错误关闭的位置 Hello Jado911, Thanks for the update. You can improve the risk calculation settings based on V10. The existing risk function function settings are not what I want. I hope to add a comment function to facilitate the simulation test statistics. Thank you Cheers brothers

hi thank you for all. I have a question ? as I understand that we have to count 2 hrs before Asian close(6 GMT)and 2 hrs after London open (London open at 7 GMT and that make the 2 hrs is 9 GMT) so from 6:01 to 8:59 GMT that's make the total of 3 hrs is that right or I have to count from 6:01 GMT to 8:59 GMT

--- 帖子 #540 ---
2hrs of Asian close and 2hrs of London open on your time zone.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Many thanks for this Indicator, its so good!!!! its possible convert on Expert Advisor!? many thanks!!!!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I thinking to make and expert advisor, but i dont have the knoweldge, anyone can help me? my idea its the expert advisor have this: Range to set fibonacci: Start hour and minute for make a fibonacci (High and low of the range) End hour and minute for make and fibonacci Start trading hour and minute End trading hour and minute Delete all orders at end trading hour (true or false) Introduce the fibonacci levels with comma separate values: Fibonacci levels buy stop Fibonacci levels sell stop Fibonacci levels buy limit Fibonacci levels sell limit If one order enter, cancel all others orders (true or false) Magic number EA start trailing stop at fibo level first place of trailing stop (for got a minimal profit) in fibo level Step of trailing stop

Hello. How can I learn how to trade with indicator ichimoku boxes? Do you know the educational source? I mean boxes 9, 26 and 52?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Had a look at this thread and was wondering why it didn't get more traction as the concept seems very good.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Here is a trade I had yesterday. Took 35 pips at TP 1 = 1/0.5 R/R. The R/R isn't great but I have reviewed trade after trade and if you get the direction right you win about 9/10 trades.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
