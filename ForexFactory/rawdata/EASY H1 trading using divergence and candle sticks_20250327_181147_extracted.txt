This system does not use any indicators except for the RSI as an oscillator.   The RSI is used as a divergence "leading" indicator to "predict" possible price reversal point.  In additon we will also look for a candle stick reversal pattern to solidify our decision. To make things more concrete, we will also look to see these reversal levels are occuring at a logical reactionary price levels, making our odds at winning the trade that much better.

I am not sure if someone else has already covered this way of trading in another thread, but if not and there is interest out there, I can certainly post some pointers and examples.

of NZDUSD H1 chart

For short setup:

1- We look for the price to form a pinbar or bearish englufing candle stick pattern.

2- We now look at RSI(7) of the price close to see if there is divergence between it and the price. i.e the price has made a higher high but the RSI either stayed level or made a lower high.

3- Look to see that the RSI has gone above the 70 level where the first point of divergence is drawn.

4- now, zoom out a bit and look to see the level where all this is occuring. Is it around a round number, or previous support/resistance level? Is it at a fib ratio? This gives us more confidence in the trade, but it doesnot have to be present.

For Long setup:

1- We look for the price to form a hammer or bullish englufing candle stick pattern.

2- We now look at RSI(7) of the price close to see if there is divergence between it and the price. i.e the price has made a lower low but the RSI either stayed level or made a higher low.

3- Look to see that the RSI has gone below the 30 level where the first point of divergence is drawn.

4- now, zoom out a bit and look to see the level where all this is occuring. Is it around a round number, or previous support/resistance level? Is it at a fib ratio? This gives us more confidence in the trade, but it doesnot have to be present.

I will discuss entry and exit and trade management tomorrow if you guys care to read

Here is a recent setup from a few hours ago on AU H1 chart ...

--- 帖子 #5 ---
before i go to bed ...   Here is USDCHF

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Absolutely. Very interested to read more. Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Some of you might know my other threads, I don't like to do historical setups and love to show these setups in realtime, and I would be doing the same in this thread if we continue on.

As it is getting late here (NY time zone) I am heading to bed and would carry on with these setups and more specifics of the trades, if there is interest.  Please let me know.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I'm in. Definitely interested in seeing more.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Sort of reminds me of the Jankone method.  He used a 6 RSI for divergence

combined with Pinbars. Also BB's and some MA's I believe...

Basic, simple trading like this pureprice is definitely another useful tool in your trading toolbox.

Cheers

It's just RSI(7)

Nothing else on the chart!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Pure and simple, I'm in.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I'm especially interested in the money and trade management in this.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
the system is like jankone ... definitely beneficial!

basically is what I use ... the only difference is that instead of RSI use CCI

I have found over time that the simplest, most beneficial

engulynf, pinbar and divergence (rsi or cci) ... not need anything more

--- 帖子 #14 ---
just helped with the zigzag, overbought-oversold, engullynf, pinbar and differences .... nothing more

look ...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Check out those two pairs as they are setting up for a long trade

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thank you for your comments porfirio and I look forward to more

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Nice to have you here bluesteele

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Yep, just RSI(7), you may also use CCI instead and it would pretty much give you the same results as was commented above

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Very good, welcome aboard

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Appears that AU  is hesitating at the 1.0500 figure and having a tough time getting above it for now, as expected

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Am I missing something cuz I don't seem to be seeing the divergence

--- 帖子 #22 ---
No, you are not missing anything.  It is not that easy to see it I guess given the two points are not that far apart.   But here is a chart in case that may help.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
So I moved my SL to BE and closed 1/2 already since Bernanke is speaking in 30 minutes according to FF calendar, and I don't want to lose this because of a speech so I normally moved to BE, that way I can't lose the trade. If the reaction to speech goes in my favour, it is a nice bonus then

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I see thanks!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Stopped out at BE.   However, we may still have a chance to get in Long again, if we go above the high of the hammer candle, as we still have divergence in place on NZDUSD

--- 帖子 #26 ---
These have NOT setup yet, but it appears as though  we "might" see setups on EU or EJ or USDCHF.   Why?  Because those are already showing signs of divergence on H!.  We need to keep a closer eye on them to see if these setups materialze.

Also, EUR AUD is setup for a possible short entry below the candle formation.  I however do not trade this pair and know nothing about it, as my spread is 5 pips, I would not trade it.  But if you trade this pair or are familiar with its personality, check out the chart below.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Can you give more specifics on when you are entering your trades once the criteria are met? Do you wait for a bar to close above or below the pin or engulfing bar as confirmation or do you enter at the close of the signal bar? Where are you setting your SL/TP?

Thanks again for sharing.

Scott

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Entry is a couple of pips above the high/below the low of the bar.  I do not wait for another bar to confirm as the pinbar or engulfing bar is already a good enough sign for entry.

I set my SL a few pips below/above the opposite side of the candle.  TP1 to be the same as SL, and TP2= 2 X SL or next support/resistance level and moving SL to BE.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
here is what i mean

--- 帖子 #30 ---
chart to show entry, SL and TP.   As said before I dont trade this pair, and I don't trade the Tokyo session, but those are examples to demonstrate the setup and trade management basic ideas

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi PurePrice,

You may want to check out Razormans Range Breaker method. It is similar to what you are doing. On the first post are several videos which you may find beneficial.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Not sure why you need a template.  It is just RSI(7) that you need to pace onto your charts.   The divergence lines are drawn manually by hand.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Nice call biDc

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thank you Chriss

--- 帖子 #38 ---
That is one of the threads that inspired me to do this  actually and thanks for pointing that out.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
The things i don't really understand is how do you know that divergence has taken place or not?

and what are the entry and exit rule??

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Very nice system. Seems to be a descent amount of setups.

Which pairs are you watching?

Thanks for sharing this. :-)

--- 帖子 #41 ---
ZieG,

You know there is divergence when the price moves one way and the oscillator, in this case the RSI moves the other way... In the chart below, look at the orange line.  See how the price made a higher high  and formed a pinbar (not so perfect but close enough to demo purposes) and RSI made a lower high?  That is Divergence.  So now you have a pinbar candle signalling possible reversal and at the same time you have RSI making a lower high, also signalling reversal.   Also, RSI was above the 70 level and headed downward.  So this is the setup we are looking for.  Now we set a pending order Short a few pips below the low of the pinbar.  SL is a few pips above the pinbar, and TP1 is equla to SL or nearest reistance/support level.  That is all there is to it  ...  Very simple

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hope you find this system useful Carol.

Normally I watch the majors plus eurjpy and gbpjpy.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Thanks.

sorry kamugi ... is that I am entering the forum, which is why you had not read

This pair is now around previous support level.  We may get a setup here so keep an eye on this pair for the next H1 bar to see what she does

--- 帖子 #47 ---
LONG trade triggred as we had a bullish englufing candle right at previous support, which gives us a "triple A" setup

--- 帖子 #48 ---
We need AU to get above 10457 (previous minor support now turned minor resistance) and it is lunch hour in NY.   IT may be slow moving until these things occur    keeping fingers crossed

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thank you so much! for taking the time.. I'm greatly appreciate it sir! thank you!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thank you for showing this way of trading.

For the people having problems to identify divergence, maybe this might help.

Install the RSI indicator and after that install the divPeak indicator in the rsi windows.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Well it is almost closing of NY session, and just now, we are back at 1.0457.  As expected, this price level did present a bit of challange and caused the price to drop about 20 pips from there down to 1.0437 or so.  However, it bouncing back now and it has been very very slow as it was just at NY lunch time that the trade was triggered and as expected, market really slows down after that point in time.  So, as it stands now, this trade is at +10 pips for me, but it is soo painfully slow moving

--- 帖子 #52 ---
This trade is now +30 pips for a TP1.  SL moved to BE on remainder and TP2 would be 1.0495 just shy of the 1.0500  round number

--- 帖子 #53 ---
How we know that price won't go down more? ( for AUDUSD ). Should we wait for bulish candle for next candle?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Divergence trading is actually one of the most basic trading method out there, but sadly few people know its powers. I've been using nothing but OsMA, fibs, trendlines on h4 and daily with success for the past 10 months.

Beats MA anyday.

It also helps you to build some market sense. In what ways? U'll have to find it out yourself.

Hi Pure Price,

Thank you for a such a simple system. One of the few systems that worked as soon as I tried it.

I tried it Yesterday on EurJpy and it worked like a charm.

Thank you RPV for your indicators, I did not use them yet, but will try them.

Pure Price, Is this okay to also try it on daily charts?

thanks

--- 帖子 #58 ---
what do you think sir Pure price?

thank you so much!

http://i42.tinypic.com/m0v7m.jpg

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I am glad you feel that way.

This works on daily as well, of course if you have the patience and ability to withstand a large StopLoss.  Daily is likely even better than H1 because you filter out all the intraday noise, and you dont need to watch the charts during the day, which is perfect for someone working fulltime job and wants to trade.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
This is done perfectly

--- 帖子 #61 ---
We dont know if the price will continue or reverse as no one can tell the furture.  That is why we place an SL in case it goes against us. When we have candlestick patterns and divergence, we are hoping this will give us a small edge, but that is all it will do.  you WILL have losers and that is part of trading.  As long as you control your losses you will be around to trade the next setup when you get it.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
for "possible" LONG setups. As things stand now and we have 10 more minutes to go for this candle to close, we are getting nice hammer formations on EJ, GJ and UJ with clear divergence on RSI. I see that EJ and GJ are at previous resistance levels which may become support now. So this would be a nice setup if we trigger long. The only bad thing about it is that we are in NY afternoon time which is generally super slow.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
This level may give us an opportunity for a short trade as the pair is sitting at parity which "should" be an important psych level... keep an eye on this level

--- 帖子 #64 ---
The Loon being worth more than US Dollar.....can't have that

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Nope  -- gotta short this sucker  LOL

--- 帖子 #66 ---
If you took those Long trades, you should be at TP1 now. Close partial and move rest to BE as it is end of NY session also.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
As expected, the USDCAD hit the parity level like it just hit a cement wall and dropped 15 pips.  Now that it is end of NY session, who knows what will happen with the dead trading period until Sydney/Tokyo open.

good calls PP. Please keep posting your charts for us ignorant of this pure trading style  Even if after the fact that way I can check and see if I saw what I thought i saw....

what is the best method to place our TP ? thank you so much sir Pure Price!

http://i42.tinypic.com/23vm5gm.jpg

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hello Komugi,

i would look always for previous support and resistance for possible target points. I have attached a H1 chart (TP = gold price label), there you can see the neckline of SHS-pattern, this is a strong support area (TP1). If we break this, we have a broken trendline, where we may can expect a possible bounce and retest (TP2). Equal how the market will go, on this trade i would advise very tight SL as we had a straight upmove the last hours and a continuation is anytime possible.

Hopefully this helps a little bit :-)

Chriss

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I generally like to place a first TP at the same amount as my SL. SL is normally a few pips above or below the high/low of the pinbar (or englufing) candle depending hther you are going short or long of course.  So that should be eay to do, and will give you a chance to make some money on the trade and would be a 1:1 risk.  If you are a trader that would liek to stay in the trade and get more out of it incase it continues in your favour.  Then as your trde hits first target(TP1) as above,  close part of your position (1/2 or 1/3, that is up to you) and move your SL to Break Even that way it is a free trade now.  You next TP could be support resistance zone, nearest round number, high/low of the day, Although i never use this but some peopel use Fib exentions and levels, OR possibly could be just a set amount of twice the amount of SL this way you can have 1:1.5 R:R trade if you hit TPs and TP2 and close 1/2 at each.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
My pleasure.   Hopefully you guys got in  on the Yen pairs as they soared up nicely to hit (TP1= SL) and (TP2 = 2 x SL) and maybe beyond.   The USDCAD went nicely down for about 30 pips but bounced back up agian, so hit TP1 for sure but that is about it.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I am not seeing anything jump out at me as upcoming possible setups, except for USDJPY as it nears previous support level around 82.30-82.40 zone and may possibly setup a long trade... lets watch this one closely. If YOU are seeing anything, please feel free to post.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
this pair looking to put in a hammer candle with divergence maybe if it continues in the next 10 minutes.

It is Friday late morning so be cautious

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Good afternoon @ all,

What pairs to watch?

Me actually looking at:  USD/CHF - it has to sink a little bit more

AUD/USD - it has to rise a little bit more

but on both the RSI looks promising. Also E/U has made a divergence on M5, sitting again at hourly resistance, is also on the screen.

Chriss

--- 帖子 #77 ---
AJ is the winner in the race to TP1, but EJ and Beast close behind. Another good call by PP. I am getting older and have noticed dementia setting in, but that is no excuse for trading like a moron for the past 5 years

--- 帖子 #78 ---
The EJ is not divergence but the AJ i thought looked better than the Beast. Because of the length of the candle I cut my TP1& 2 in half. Demo still as I have never been sharp enough to even spot divergence let alone trade it. But after a few days of practicing this method it's getting easier

cheers and good weekend

Hi

I see a little divergence on the rsi on the daily chart of EurAud.

Nice Posting, Chris.

Postings like this really helps.

Some times, there is or there is no divergence depending on your drawing skills if the divergence is very small. Is there any customizable RSI divergence indicator?

I already have the MACD ones and the one posted in this forum. the one posted does not draw the divergence lines.

An indicator that can draw the divergence will be great.

thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hey Chriss, good eye

This is the only pair I was seeing also. But looks like price action did not fall below the nice pinbar we had on the 9:00 O'clock (EST) candle.. too bad cuz that would have been a nice setup    MAYBE we will get another pinbar here and still have a chance to enter short on a tweezer trade setup like some people like to call it

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hey,

@ forexnubie: if you're not that good in spotting the divergence, then simply compare the peaks and mark them with vertical lines. They all have a value and then it's obvious. It will not take much screen time and then you will find them automtically.

I'm in. Why? Jes, there is no pinbar on H1 but we have divergence on M5 too. Second, we need to retest broken resistance (breakout) on hourly timeframe.

So,

Entry: 1.33295

SL: 1.3349

TP: 1.2990

Risk:Reward:Ratio -- 1:2

(additional the div on M5)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Regards...

Chriss

Edit: Sorry, there is a pinbar on H1, but as we have div on M5 i entered this way :-)

--- 帖子 #92 ---
This is OK for you to enter if you are using M5 charts, however, you are entering based on M5 timeframe, not H1 timeframe, just so that readers are aware of this and are not confused.

for this Short setup on EU. I would normally wait for the H1 timeframe to form a bearish enguling or pinbar candle and then enter 5 pips or so below the low of that candle given that we have divergence with RSI, and RSI reading was above 70 level (thereby signalling possible overbought level).

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I'm out right now with +7 pips. Market runs sideways and in 20 minutes Mr. Draghi is speaking.

Looks like market is waiting for these news, as we are running sideways now since nearly 2 hours.

I don't want to raise my stop, so out and waiting for the news.

PurePrice, have you put a pending order under the candle? Maybe the news will send it fast down.

Greetings

Chriss

--- 帖子 #94 ---
No, I dont have a pending order.  I am waiting to see candle formation on this hourly candle first .

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thank you for your reply, Pure Price.

So, to clear it up, we just wait for a bearish/bullish engulfing, pinbar or an inside bar, then look for divergence in the RSI, preferable 30/70 level, and enter the trade in the direction of the divergence of the oscillator?

Is there any other things that we had to watch for? For example the EU showed a little divergence on 1 hour today, a few candles ago. The price made a high but RSI was almost flat. Was this a valid signal?

I like RSI than MACD. Is MACD divergence any better?

thanks, once again for a good system, Pure Price.

thanks

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Your understanding is correct.

The signal was a valid signal on EU, but we didnot get price action follow thru below the pinbar candle to trigger a short trade.  Eventhough the RSI was flat, the price itself made a higher high, which means divergence between the price and the oscillator.

If you can make MACD work for you then that is up to you, but basic divergence is the same, and the idea is exactly the same.  What I dont know about MACD is where the indicator might be considered overbought or oversold as with RSI those levels are clearly defined.  Some traders use 70/30, some use 80/20 or whatever you wish with RSI. With MACD, i just don't know where that would be

--- 帖子 #97 ---
It is certainly the end of the trading day here in NY session, but there might be a good setup coming up on USDCAD (maybe save it till Sydney/oyko session) around 0.9900.   Watch this level closely for a possibility of a Long trade setup, as this level is not only a pysch round number but also it is where the hourly rising trendline hits.  So, I expect a reaction around this level.  If we get a pinbar and divergence there too, it would be like AAA setup

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Well, another pair of possible setups at end of day here in NY. The RSI on those two pairs has been well over the 70 level, and it dropped and now going back up to maybe a lower peak than the previous one, while the price itself is looking like it will put in a higher high, and thereby possibly creating divergence. If we end up with a nice bearish candle formation and divergence, we may see a short trade setup on those pairs in upcoming Sydney/Tokyo.

Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thank you for the reply.

I like the RSI, somehow MACD does not work for me.

On USDCAD, what time frame we have to look for?

Thanks for posting upcoming trades, Pure Price!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Pure Price,

You are doing great!!!

Again just to confirm, when you say end of the day, you mean daily charts or what time frame should we be looking out for, on AUDUSD AND NZDUSD?

Once again, it is very simple and easy to follow!

thanks

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I use H1 charts for this method only.  So, if I dont explicitly mention timeframe, I mean  H1.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I mean H1 again. sorry about the confusion with "end of day" phrase. I just meant it is the end of trading session in NY not the daily candle ... my apologies

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Well, it appears that we do have a short setup on AU after the close of the 16:00 (EST) candle as expected.  The price went back up to the same exact pip as previous peak creating a possible doubletop at 1.0544 and headed down to form a pinbar, while the RSI headed down, after reaching a value of around 85 (overbought).   The only issue I have with this setup is that is happening now after 5pm EST and markets are pretty much dead now.  But in terms of the ingredients of our trade setup, this qualifies very well and we would trigger a short trade below say 1.0530.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
This one is playing nicely for now. As expected the price went down and headed toward 0.9900 while the RSI slightly went up (while still below 30 in oversold territory) creating a divergence for now, but we still need to see a bullish candle formation on the price to consider this a setup, as that is one important element of our trade setup. Will be looking for a bullish engulfing on the 17:00 o'clock candle for now

Here is the chart, with trendline and divergence drawn

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi Pure Price,

Thanks for the update on AUD USD AND NZD USD pairs.

The divergence was little, but I took the trade.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks for the update!

Pure Price, again, thanks for taking the initiative to post it.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Traders,

I think a divergence could be setting up on NZD JPY on the hourly chart.

thanks

--- 帖子 #107 ---
setting up for a short on H1 .. Why?

1- Price made a a double top (same peak as previous) and put in a Pinbar candle formation signalling bearish bias.

2- RSI made a lower high, therefore we have divergence.

3- RSI was over the 70 level, therefore we have oscillator in overbought territory.

4- We now will place a pending order  a few pips just below the low of the pinbar, as marked by the magenta rectangle in the chart below.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
i like to user AO as my indicator to detect DIV..and it also give me a signal whether it is a retrace signal or reversal trend signal..

--- 帖子 #109 ---
You are most welcome.  I hope you find some of this stuff helpful in your trading.

the AU trade is shaping up nicely I think  and now we have a very similar, almost identical setup on GU.

Good work Kumugi,

The 5:00 EST candle formed a nice pinbar and we had divergence in overbought area above 70 level, making this a good short setups  Looking at the price now, this is a +20 pip trade if you actually took the trade when it triggered.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Well, due to the bad habit of sleeping  I missed many trade setups on the major pairs. Pretty much at the same time as the setup that Kumogi mentioed above at the 5:00 (EST) O'clock candle. Again, good work Kumogi for alerting readers to the setup, and the many other setups that were happening at the same time if you were to check the other currency pairs.  See the GU chart below.

It would be great, if whoever sees a setup coming up can alert the readers here to watch out for it, especially during Frankfort/London, as I am sleeping during these times. Thanks in advance.

Good luck trading today

It's just my pleasure! i took the trade after the first confirmation candle. out with 25+ SL to TP. 1:1. Absolutely stress free! thanks to you too for the powerful system!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Just wanted to show my AUDUSD trade from last night. Being in the US, I took the short trade on an earlier pin bar. The first half of the trade went to TP1 within a few hours. I moved the second half's SL to break even and let it run. After a few more bars, though, it was apparent it was headed for the stop, so I closed it out manually for a small profit. This was my first trade with this system and was on a live account. Made a bit over 1.7% on the trade.

PurePrice, just wanted to get your thoughts on pulling the trigger right there... thanks again for the simple but effective system.

Cheers,

This was done correctly on the first pinbar last night.   That is the same trade I mentioned at the end of NY closing yesterday.  Good work Scott  and congrats on the 1.7%

--- 帖子 #120 ---
although it is very early in the 10:00 oclock candle, we already have overbought RSI levels, and it is looking like the RSI is not making the higher high that teh actualy prices have made, so we may have divergence here.  So, we just need a bearish candle here, either pinbar or bearish engulfing to setup a short trade, and then we will trigger if price actions follows through below those candles (IF we get them).  Watch those two pairs closely for the next hour to see how the candle will close

I will be back in an hour for an update if I can ...

--- 帖子 #121 ---
IF anyong is holding AU long position still, consider taking profits here as it hits the rising trendline.  See chart where the arrow is.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi

Thanks for the update.

Just a clarification.

Consider taking profits because it hit the trendline? Bullish hammer on the trendline, is it not considered as a bullish formation? Buy chance

or is it due to RSI bearish divergence, that takes precedence over the bullish hammer on the trendline? Sell chance

Buy or sell here?

thanks

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi Pure Price,

Love those setup updates. Gives us more confidence and going to try it after the bearish engulfing or hammer forms.

Thanks!

Once again, these live updates are excellent!

thanks

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I think he meant to say "If anyone is holding AU short position" rather than "long position". It's probably heading back up from here.

Scott

--- 帖子 #125 ---
You are correct Scott.

I apologize for that mistake. The AU trade was SHORT, not long. and hiting the trendline would likely cause the price to bounce UP from there and this is a good place to lock in profits on a SHORT position that we were holding.  I get a minute or two at work to update and while in a hurry i screwed up .. sorry about that.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Well, they certainly formed a bearish engulfing candles here and that gives us a nice short setup

--- 帖子 #127 ---
While we have the setup, we do not have a trigger on EJ yet and it is getting to the lunch hour in NY.   GJ looks like it has already hit the trigger point but she is retracing back up again.  Hopefully GJ will dive soon but make sure you have your SL in place just in case she keeps going up

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi Pure Price,

Can you explain on what trigger you are mentioning about on EuroYen?

There was bearish engulfing candle and there was divergence in the RSI.

What else we require? Are we missing something?

I thought that was all to take the trade.

Please explain.

Once again, Pure Price, thank you for all help.

thanks'

--- 帖子 #129 ---
That is what we need for a short setup.  You forgot to mention tht RSI had to be in  overbought level above 70 too    BUT We still need the price to follow through and actually go below (I like about 3-5 pips below) the low of the engulfing candle.  That is the trigger point.   In the case of EJ, price never went below the bearish engulfing candle, and thus there was no trade trigger.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Porfiro,

could you describe your system ? Especially which TF (1H or higher ?), entry and TP position.

Best regards from Poland

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Follow the leader i guess....see what happens

--- 帖子 #132 ---
All of these questions have been answered. Just read the thread from the beginning.

Scott

--- 帖子 #133 ---
PurePrice,

I see EJ has still yet to trigger, and it's been over four bars now. I still have a pending trade set. When do you no longer consider it a valid trade and remove your pending orders? After a certain number of bars or when the price starts to clearly move in the opposite direction or something else?

Thanks,

Scott

--- 帖子 #134 ---
PurePrice,

I also have a question. On my charts, all of the engulfing candles on the Yen pairs were pretty large. Is there a length of candle that would discourage you from taking a trade?

Thanks.

Carol

--- 帖子 #135 ---
If we still have divergence it is still valid, although i dont like to enter at end of NY session.   I would watch price action in Tokyo to see how that works.  But generally 3-4 bars after setup is more than enough for a trigger, if not, let it go and look for something else.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Very valid question.  Usually when there is a large bar, it will most of the time retrace a bit then go back to original direction.  So, if we put in a large bearish candle like we did with yen pair, i would expect it to retrace  a bit before continuing which happened in EJ.  However, with most pairs more than 40 pips is getting too risky.  However with GJ i would say 50 pips is good as this pair moves more pips than any other I watch.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
@ PurePrice, I've dragged this from my chart it shows a move from the other day on EURUSD, notice the red lines drawn on, would you call this divergence?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
hi all

curious to know if this was/is a valid setup

a few bearish candles in there too now
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #139 ---
GDR3k, I could be wrong here, and we definitely should have PP weigh in on this, but I don't typically draw my trend and divergence lines over such long periods (5 days) on an hourly chart. Seems if you go out that far, the information is probably less useful.

Heads-up on possible long trade: AUDCAD

Slight divergence under the 30 level and a possible bullish engulfing.

Scott

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Yes, it's called Bullish Regular Divergence and is counter trend following.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Nice high probability Bearish Regular Divergence counter trend - reversal type trade with confirming strong resistance candles and double pin bars below a round number (1.600).  The cross of your 5 & 10 MAs could be used for entry.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi I'm new here. I like the simplicity and logic of the set ups.

It's late in the Asian session and NZD USD looks like it is setting up nicely

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hello traders,

EJ is going smoothly atm.

On the watch list -possible long setting up on AUD-USD

all the b.

chriz

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Aye, I've never looked at using divergence before in my trading however this thread has changed that, I took a trade before on audusd showing divergence on the 30m.

USD CAD also showing divergence.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Hi,

Looks like a divergence may set up on EURNZD.

Thank you traders for posting setups and upcoming setups.

Let us chat and hope we are helpful to each other.

Comments welcome on EurNzd.

thanks

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I hope it's not on a live

a good pinbar has its open & close between the previous candle

Right now you can see a good pinbar on AUD/USD 30m and H1. good luck!

Note: just to make it clear.  you're trading based on 30m not H1. So be cautious, lower time frame louder the noises!

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hello GDR3k,

Thanks for posting.

I normally do not go that far back.  I usually look at the two most recent peaks/troughs to draw my lines.   If you would to go that far, then switch to a higher TF like H4 or daily, and trade off those charts.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
yes, very valid setup, and I would enter this short trade after the break of the low of the pinbar(s)

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Pureprice, can you show me where is pinbar candle that you mean? I just want to be clear about pinbar candle in this case.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi

Played a buy on today morning pinbar and with RSI divergence on NZDUSD. Currently on a loss, 3 bars after the trade.

RSI below 30, Pinbar, price followed 7 pips above the pinbar, took the buy trade.

Looks like the trade will go against us.

Any comments, advise, suggestions, reasons that i should have avoided the trade etc, welcome.

thanks

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hello Alpine,

I dont know how to draw on a chart that was posted by someone else. But i was referring to the two consecutive pinbars on the chart that went betweeen hi of 1.6000 and low of 1.59500

--- 帖子 #153 ---
The trade looks valid to me, and you just happen to hit a loss. As long as you had a proper SL set for you position, that should be a small loss.

Do not kill yourself over one losing trade and don't ever let anyone tell you that you will win 100% of your trades. This is no holy grail. We are hoping for a small edge to win some trades, not all.  Losses are part of trading and you should always be ready to expect that, and if they happen, you should be ready to accept the losses, take them in stride and move on to the next trade.  Go in each trade expecting to lose and knowing how much you will lose before you even hit the trigger button. That is how this business is run. Consider your loss to be an expense of running the business, no business is run without expenses, and no business makes money without spending money. As long as you control your losses, and your trading system gives you an edge and you exercise sound money management you will be in the black at the end of the month.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
thank you pure price.

Good explaination on Money Management.

I am not very concerned about the loss as I trade only Micro lots. Just wanted to confirm if I was trading it right.

Your reply gave me confidence because my entry was right. I am not too concerned about the loss.

Just wanted to confirm if I was trading right, in the first place.

I would rather take a small loss with right trading because there is always another trade.

thanks

--- 帖子 #155 ---
We still have about 30 minutes to go for the close of the candle, but this is the only pair that looks like it may have a potential setup.  The pair is at parity (again) which should present a barrier to the upside. I looks like we may have divergence in overbought zone on RSI.  We just need that nice bearish candle formation now (likely in the form of a pinbar) ... lets wait and see what she does

--- 帖子 #156 ---
You traded according to the rules and followed the plan, and that is about all you could do really. Will get em next time as I think so far we have picked way many more winners than losers, and some of the winners went to TP2 giving us an overall positive outsome.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Great reply, Pure Price.

Full of confidence.

Great that you are helping traders and analyzing their trades and training them, helping them understand the divergence.

I really appreciate it.

thanks

--- 帖子 #158 ---
You are most welcome.  I am glad to help, and certainly hope you are getting some trading tips out of this thread that might come in handy with your trading career.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi there is this a valid but failed setup on AU H1 today? Thanks

Please ignore those MAs

--- 帖子 #160 ---
would anyone have any comments for this set up, a trade from support?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Binyamin,

I also took the aud usd and also EurAud earlier, and they both failed.

But, I think we will have more winners than losers.

Also, correct stop losses and 1:2 risk to reward should make you profit.

You have to win only 40 to 50 percent of your trades to be profitable if you use a 1:2 RR

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I would also like to thank you PurePrice  for taking the time and effort to create this excellent teaching resource.

It's a great help when you point out the differences between a good trade which didn't work out and a losing trade which was a wrong entry.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Finally this pair moved as expected and is now sitting at TP1.  IF you took the short trade here, you may want to consider booking some profit here at TP1

You are welcome.  I will try my best to comment on setups when I can, but I have the curse of having a fulltime job (9 to 5:30 NY time)

Here is the chart of H1 NZDUSD showing divergence in oversold territory and hammer candle formation.  Note that it is a small sized candle and it is just before NY open ... so something to watch for as I, myself, do not trade just before a session open.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi,

I appreciate you posting the charts.

But please remember that you are posting MACD divergences that is totally different from what Pure Price started. He started it on RSI.

The issue is that if tomorrow, someone brings in CCI divergence, and someone else brings in Schotastics divergence, the whole thing is now a different trading method and will confuse traders.

Too many additions and variations to the original concept will distract traders and not give them enough time to practice one concept.

I do not have an issue of you having the MACD, but the issue here is absence of RSI, the main indicator of the whole concept.

I have no intention to confront you, please do not take it personal.

Just include RSI also, that is the whole idea behind this method.

Pure Price can feel free to comment.

thanks

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Pure  Price,

thank you for sharing your method. What I liek about it and whats different from all the other threads is that you post live charts instead of after the fact ....  really helps us see what you're seeing ...

I was hoping you could tell us the pairs you trade and since you've been trading this a while how may trades you get on average (roughly) each week

thx again

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Now that it has moved +20 pips, I locked profit as the trading day is getting late in NY and usually dies at about this time.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I normally look at all the major pairs, plus EJ and GJ.  I dont look at the exotic pairs.  That should give you about 8 pairs, but you only need to glance at those charts for about 2 minutes every hour to spot a setup.  Once you have a setup, you could place a set and forget pending order.   You can always look at the historical charts to get an idea how many setups you will get, as I do not trade all the time and wont be a fair measure of the system to use me as a gauge.  I sleep during frankfort/london and I work full-time during NY session.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
This position is now sitting at about +40 pips and close to TP1 as the NY session closes down, it is a good point to cash in your TP1.

Also, if you have taken AU or NU long positions, they are also sitting at TP1.  you should consider closing part of your position at this point as these trades hit TP1

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Good morning @ all,

mini divergence on hourly e/u... if i'm right, we have to wait if this hourly candle forms a nice pinbar, inverted hammer or any other reverse sign.

Me already entered, as we had also a bearish divergence on m5.

The only potential setup I see for now is GBPUSD.  I am starting to see divergence in overbought territory.  Lets see if we get a bearish candlee to confirm our reversal.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Also, watch the usdchf chart for possible long setup

I was in meetings all morning, but looks like GU actually triggered a short after a nice doubletop pinbar tweezer bearish trade setup around 1.6005.

It is now at TP! and whoever took the short trade might want to lock in some profit as TP1 (about 25 pips)  is getting hit now and it is Friday

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Good work text     looks like you just hit your TP

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thanks for following up on this setup as I was not able to and have been in meetings all morning.   This one seems to have worked just fine and hit TP1 so far.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Yes sir Price and thanks  #2 postion at break even and free ride. Swissy had a nice pin bar but not the best divergence but still tradeable imo. I'll probably exit with a small loss in the next ten minutes or break even with the swissy.Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Stumbled across this little RSI Divergence pattern the other day. I call it the Itty-Bitty-Tiny-Little-Winnie RSI Divergence Pattern because it only involves two bars... and because it sounds funny.

This RSI Divergence pattern comes when the price makes a new High/Low,  but the bar displayed is a down bar (if new High is made) or a up bar  (if a new Low is made). While at this Divergence Bar RSI is showing a decrease (if a new High is  made) or a increase (if a new Low is made).

This might sound a little confusing, so I made you a picture (blue lines  show the  Itty-Bitty-Tiny-Little-Winnie RSI Divergence Bars). You can see that it can point out a number of tops and bottoms pretty well.

Couple of rules: If you make an entry using this pattern, then enter at the High/Low of the Diverging Bar (the bar that displays the pattern; basically the same rule that PurePrice applies to his Divergence Bars). The Diverging Bar should be the opposite colour of the previous bar This Divergence pattern should only occur between two bars P.S. Like all things in the market world, this is not 100% right all the time. There are false signals out there, so be sure to cover your $$$ with a stoploss, or some other fail-safe method.

hi

today a double top in eur/usd in h1 timeframe in asia zone.

So, we dont use RSI anymore?

I know any of these indicators like RSI, MACD, CCI, SCHOTASTICS can be used for divergence.

But what is this system based on?

thanks

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Dear trades,

Thank you all for posting and sharing your trades and setups with the group.  However, there has been a few questions about what indicators to use for divergence and why pople use different ones.  You could use any of the oscillators you wish for YOUR trading (such as RSI, MACD, CCI, etc.), however this is confusing some traders here and I am getting some questions about it.  I would respectfully ask that when you post setups, to please post with RSI (7) as the only indicator.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #197 ---
yes it is.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
in my experience trading divergence works really well. I'm curious as to why, anyone know the theory behind whats happening in the market while trading off of divergence?

I like your system.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
When divergence occur the market

1) Decelerate

2) Pullback and make lower/higher highs/lows

When a market trend and then gradually slow down divergence happen.

Hi everyone,

Thank you PP for this strategy, I'm looking forward to implementing it. I haven't read all pages of this thread (I've only read 6 because it's late!), but I Only have one question. Does it work only in H1 timeframe or does it work too in m15, m30 or smaller tf's?

Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Bro.. Divergence works well in Every TF but like every indicator it will also get some whipsaws in lower TF basically Recommended using from 15 Min TF...

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Divergence works in all timeframes, but the smaller the time frame the more noise you will get.  The bigger the time frame the longer you have to wait for a trade setup and the bigger the stoploss value.  H1 seems to be in the middle of all that.  M15 might be a good option if you want to go to a shorter time frame and H4 would be my next choice for higher timeframe.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
The market has not been very generous to me the last couple of days and there has been no setups really that I have come across.  It has been a couple of dry days (in NY session at least) and that is the reason why I have not posted.  Hopefully we will get some setups during the rest of this week.  But I would rather be on the sidelines than in the market with a loss.

Agin, if you see any setups, please share with the group.

what about Bullish engulf today on au ? not yet triggered similar on nzdusd also blended 1hr pin on cable off support with divergence anyone take any of these ?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I took the AUDUSD trade on Wednesday on the first bullish engulfing candle. Maybe I will post a chart tomorrow (sorry, time for me to head to bed). Wouldn't say it was one of my better trades, and it was in a losing position most of the day. However, it did not hit stoploss and has managed to climb halfway to TP1. As a result, I went ahead and moved the SL to breakeven. Don't really want to take a loss on this one. Will see what happens overnight.

Hi Traders,

Looks like a divergence in Eur JPY on both 1 hour and 4 hour charts. The price is making lower lows but RSI is not. There is also a bullish hammer.

Please comment if it is valid.

thanks

--- 帖子 #209 ---
there is also a mini divergence at Weekly and a proper Divergence On Daily as there are also another 2 bullish rejection which tried to make new high 2 times but failed this is confirming the first divergence as a valid signal. this is a strong divergence. Nevertheless enter trade with your own risk!

regards

Edit: as you late to jump into the train on the first signal there was another chance on bearish engulfing as a signal for  2nd chance but now i don't know if there is a 3rd chance! good luck

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi,

Took the trade on EURJPY BUY on 1 hour RSI divergence and made 20 pips!

Very good reply, Komugi. Really appreciate it.

The daily time frame has a more prominent divergence on the RSI. The price almost is flat, did not make new highs, but RSI made a dive, showing bearish divergence.

The weekly, the price had a little high, but RSI did not make any high.

Both weekly and daily show bearish divergence.

Please tell me if my observation is right and what will be optimal price range to place the trade?

thanks

Hi

The divergence concept seems to be simple to follow.

Do we also consider the trend of the pair? like for example, only bullish divergence on uptrend pairs or only bearish on downtrend pairs?

Or do we just trade the divergences with the correct confluences no matter the trend?

thanks

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Good question

Generally when trading divergence you are looking at possible reversal points, and in most setups you would be going against the trend for the time frame you are trading.  That is why some traders do not like trading this setup because it is counter-trend setup in most cases.   You could possibly look at the higher timeframe and only trade divergence with the trend in the higher time frame, say H4 or Daily when you are trading divergence off the H1 charts, or H4 and H1 when trading off M15.   Now that begs the question, how do you determine "trend"

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Thank you Pure Price.

I am not very particular about with the trend or counter trend as long as the method is profitable most of the time.

There were many times in the past where I traded the so called "with the trend" and lost money.

Trading with the trend can make profits quickly, but as long as any method is profitable, that is what matters.

thanks

I took a trade on CADJPY earlier today and was successful. I actually saw the trade late (I am at work during the morning hours, so it is hit and miss when I can look at the charts), but it enabled me to get a better entry. I ended up risking only 1% and made around 4% on this trade. A nice one. Chart attached. Anyone else do any trades today?

Scott

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Here is one that I caught too late today and didn't get to enter. Would have been another win, though. Anyone grab this one?

Scott

--- 帖子 #221 ---
You suppose to enter at a pin or engulfing. Your last 2 trades was neither.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
looks like divergence, right? is this still considered divergence if we have a triangle?

thanx, great system!.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hmmm... well, the CADJPY was clearly an engulfing, and the NZDUSD was for all practical purposes an engulfing candle also (the close of the previous candle was 0.82329 and the open of the engulfing candle was 0.82325, so less than half a pip of difference. It's not like it gapped down 3 pips or something. Not sure about PurePrice's thought on that, but I'm comfortable taking that trade. I have attached both charts again with the engulfing candles marked so they can be easily seen.

Scott

--- 帖子 #224 ---
No that is absolutely not an engulfing. The whole of the previous bar have to be covered by the engulfing bar. But if it makes you money in the long run fine just keep trading it.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hallo Traders,

my english is not so good (sorry). I have a Indicator that shows automatic divergences on RSI. Can anyone set a Alert to this indicator. Look todays M15 Divergence on the chart. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Here the indicator.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
There were a couple trades in the overnight period (US). I caught the EUR/USD short before going to bed. Divergence plus bearish engulfing equals another win. Good week thus far!

Scott

--- 帖子 #228 ---
So I identified these 2 setups from the 9/4 and 10/4. They seem like perfect setups to me - the GBPUSD trade is triggered by the pin bar marked, entry occurs 2 bars later and the SL and TP levels are marked. Half closed at 12.8 pips, the rest closed at 25.6 pips.

Likewise for the USDCHF chart, the bullish engulfing bar marked triggers the trade and entry occurs 2 bars later. Again the SL and TP levels are marked. Half closed at 16.3, the rest closed at 32.6.

So these look great on paper - now I just need to catch them happenning live!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Traders what do think about this one?

Possible recovery in the stock market  i.e good alcoa results and very oversold

I might have spoken too soon. Yes the double bottom has gone. The divergence on the hourly is still intact and the current candle is just about to engulf the previous candle.

How does it look on your charts?

Unfortunately, I just got out of a meeting and missed that setup. Looks like a pretty good one, Olu. Good luck.

Yeah they both look promising trades. Im new to this thread and the RSI Divergence system, but it looks very promising.

How are you guys getting on with it?

What the win/loss ratio like?

Im looking forward to getting involved in this thread and sharing alerts etc...

Think Im gonna jump in on the EURUSD

Good luck

--- 帖子 #238 ---
The close was a qualifying candle. But we have not taken out the low of the candle. IMHO as long as the high of the candle is not taken out this is still a possibility

Olu

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Yeah Ive got my pending order in place.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
This system is excellent. I am only able to trade it infrequently or in the evenings in the UK as I hold down a full time job. But man master this and you will be 'stemming' some serious pips

Olu

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Sounds Good Olu

Do you think the GBPUSD is also now a potential setup??

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Where abouts are you in the Uk? Im in Leeds. Ive been trading full time for 6 months with no real consistency yet. I have done many courses but am still looking for regular results

What the best time to trade this method?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thanks for posting guys.  All setups have been valid and looked great.

Now we have usdchf, eurusd and gbpusd looking for potential trades.  It looks like we have divergence already and we need to break the  low/high of the pinbar candles on the eurusd and usdchf to trigger those trades.  The gbpusd setup has a bearish engulfing candle close and we need to beark the low of that candle to trigger a short.  I usually use about 5 pips buffer for my entry.

Good luck traders!!!

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Its already triggered me in. I only use 2 pips.

Fingers crossed!!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Can you guys who have been using this system tel me where you would take profit on the current GBPUSD trade.

Is it just above the next round number of 1.5850? Would you scale half out at this level and then maybe half out at the previous days low? Do you think it will make the previous days low?

Would you guys even scale out at all and just take out all profit in one go?

Opinions appreciated

I am in Essex UK. What we need for this trade to work is momentum. So I will take the trades during the Europe and US sessions. Or if it is aud, jpy, nzd I can do it through the Asian hours

Wish you success in finding consistency. Its what every trader wants.

By the way the gbp trade is good once the low of the signal candle is broken

Olu

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Thanks Olu

Yeah the signal bearish engulfing candles low was already taken out, so im in a short position. However my stop is been tested to the max as i write this post. Seems there is a lot of market confusion.

I was wondering if there was some kind of indicator or EA that alerts you when these trades set-up? It would be very handy and would make sure you got in on all possible trades.

If you didnot take the EU or GU or UC trades earlier, consider the setups in NU and AU for now

--- 帖子 #253 ---
consider this level seriously as price may bounce here.  You may want to move to tight your SL or TP, it is up to you, but be cautious of this level

--- 帖子 #254 ---
GU at 15900 and EJ at 106.00 may help the price go up also.

I was just going to post about the audusd possible short

I am happy we are all getting this. This strategy has earned a permanent place in my arsenal. The sheer simplicity of the system. A true KISS

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Can i ask a simple question please? Are we determining exit/TP on previous S/R levels etc at our own personal discretion or would you suggest a set TP pip rate etc....  for example, close position at +50 whatever happens?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi,

Please see attached screen for nzdusd divergence. The RSI indicator showed a bearish divergence and I placed a sell after the hammer and made some profits.

The chart has both regular RSI and the RSI divergence indicator.

Can you please explain the indicator? Your indicator almost shows both BUY and SELL and it did not plot the latest divergence that is plotted in Yellow on the chart and on the regular RSI.

I am trying to understand your indicator, please explain.

thanks

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Couldnt agree more. Im loving this system. Simplistic yet powerful!!

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi Pure Price,

Thank you for the nzd usd call. good one.

thank you so much for posting. I have asked my wife to look for your postings when I am at work.

thank you once again.

Keep it up.

thanks

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Good deal

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I usually place TP1 = SL.  TP2= 2 x SL

SL is place a few pips above the high (or below the low) of the setup candle

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Lucky you that your wife can watch these

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hmmmmmmmm,, I see a BUY on your NZDUSD chart and we are setting up short ... Am I seeing this correctly on your chart or am I confused??

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Glad you like it.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Pure price. Do you always keep your stop above/below the signal candle?

Do you ever place it slightly above/below 50% level? Especially on larger candles?

I was just wondering as it would increase risk reward ratio!!! However im guessing it would lower your win/loss ratio. Im new to this thread and system and i am impressed with it thus far. Im hoping it will revive my intraday trading......otherwise ile have to go back to the mundane day job lol

Thank you very much for sharing this pure price. I am going to be posting alerts myself for other traders.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi Pure Price,

You are right. It was setting up for SELL and I have made some pips from that after your posting.

What I was trying to clarify was with Schirka, that his indicator was not showing the bearish divergence as we spotted in on our chart and our regular RSI indicator.

thanks for the posting, again.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi Pure Price,

EURUSD bounced from 3100 as you said!

what a guess! great!

I sold SELL eurusd on the divergence as posted earlier, now price has started to bounce, do i close it, or let it run? what did you do? are you out of the divergence sell on that pair?

thanks

--- 帖子 #268 ---
If the candle is larger than 40-50 pips, i would likely not take the trade cuz the price is very likely to retrace a bit before going in the correct direction. I like to keep my SL above/below the high/low of the signal candle until I hit TP1 or a level I believe to be a strong support/resistance or round numbers at which point i will move the reminader position to BE

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hmm, good question.

If i believe this is a support level (which it is of course), I would close partial position, move rest to BE, and let the rest ride as this is TP1 (for about 25-30 pips if you got in around 13130, SL would be 13160, TP1 would be 13100) .. BUT this is just my style, it doesnot have to be yours

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Have you got or Know of an indicator or EA, which could alert ones self via email of rsi divergence??

It would mean that we could catch every set-up and maximise profits.

Do you use this system for the Tokyo session?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
If it was me id stick to aus/nzd/jpy pairs for that session. Me on the other hand will be snoozing in bed during Tokyo.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I was thinking the same thing Mr burns lol.

But i have my metatrader setup to text me alerts so i would be willing to get out of bed to catch a trade. But defo would not be willing to sit in front of computer all night.

Where you from? Im from UK Leeds

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I do not have an EA or indi that will alert.  There was a posting in post #227 that had an indicator, but I have not tried it and donot think it alerts automatically.  I don't even know if it draws divergence properly.

As for Tokyo session, I personally do not trade it as it tends to be really slow moving, and not alotta pip movement usually, with some exceptional sessions of course.  However, the best pairs to trade would be EJ, UJ, AU and NU during the Tokyo session, and look for small profit targets.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Thanks PP

Do you carry on trading the us session though if there are set-ups, as late US Like around now can be quiet too?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Im from Birkenhead, Liverpool mate, but live in Wiltshire near Bristol, im ex army so thats why, was based close by to Bristol and had a kid with a local by the time i left the army, so no going home to mummy for me!

I trade of Oanda FXtrade, but have MT4 also with another Oanda account, dont use it that much though. The RSI and charts are fine for me on FXTrade

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Oh and just check up regularly on your charts at certain times of the day to do some analysis before certain markets open etc and at points through the day. Also make a note of any up and coming news that might effect price and cater for it in your stop.

That text alert thing would do my head in eventually.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Yeah the system seems sound. Just hope it stands the test of time.

So your a fellow northerner coool!

Hows your trading going with this system?

Ive been trading 6 months with a live account. The first 4 1/2 month i managed to wipe half of my account out. I have done many courses. The first one I did in London at a place called knowledge to action, which give me a good foundation but no consistency with the strategies i learned.

I have started to get more consistant in the last month and im hoping this method will help me along the way.

Intraday trading can be though to crack and if i dont manage intraday consistency soon, i will be forced back to my boring day job, leaving only time for end of day trading.

Are you trading with a demo account?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi ST

I did the knowledge to action course and found it ok. How come you didnt like it?

Olu

--- 帖子 #279 ---
no just a small live account, first account ( i say that as there may be a few lol).

I have found that my patience is the hard i need to reign in, thats why im drawn to this kind of trading. Yeh northern boy born and bred.

getting more consistant as the days go on, just make stupid trades sometimes and regret it

I have access to trading during work hours so just keep an eye out during the day for set ups, its good stuff

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Not too sure about the EURUSD Olu, so think im gonna leave it.

Yeah the Knowledge to Action course was very good, an excellent all round course. But the strategies i learned did not give me consistant results in my intraday trading. Could never guess when you would get the bounce with the sniper strategy......Pivots were good but again not a high enough win/loss......snap back i did not rate.

How did you find Knowledge to action? did you get results from there strategies and consistency?

What it did give me is a really good foundation and introduction into forex......but didnt make me any money

EURUSD DROPPED!

I would like to clarify where the divergence in nzd usd is? I could not find any. Can you please post the chart, if you can, please.

Also, there is no bearish candle stick price action.

On eurusd, there is a bearish railroad track, well, almost.

Can you please explain nzd usd?

thanks

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi guys (PurePrice nad rest of participants),

First time posting here. I was always interested in dev trading but could not find good teacher.

I have one question and this is about your SL and targets. I find out that on EU, if differance in pips fro high of dev to low of triger bar is more then 40 pip i would not take the trade. I set SL above high of dev formation and but not more then 35-40 pip and aim fo 35 pip profit. If differance is smaler, like 25 pip I set my SL and target acordingly.

I just noticed GU div close to daily R2 and at 62.8 fib.

Please check the picture and comet please. SL 40 target 45 (GU needs more room than EU I guess). This is live trade.

Thanks and best regards.

sasa

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi, one more dev is forming. lets see how the clos of the candle will be. It would be better is daily R2 was hih but lets not be misers. Market is deciding.

I will put sell stop order if it close as dev.

BTW I believe we will be getting lots of divergences later on because of the run up in price today. All because of a rumour??? of stimulus from china. If this rumour is denied in the asian session then down we go

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Possible setup.

What do you think??

Fernando

--- 帖子 #306 ---
imho it is a real signal. gbpusd had a massive, divergence busting upday today and is in need of some retracement. I am overall bearish long term on this pair so I will be taking the break of the low of the signal candle

Hi PurePrice,

Just a comment off the topic but are you the same PurePrice that competed in the Sure Fire Trading Challenge a while back? If you are then how did you make out there? I was cheering for you....Why? because I'm originally from Vancouver, yup another Canuck!

Nice simple system you have here and we haven't even talked about hidden RSI divergence yet showing trend continuation patterns

Good Stuff..... T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #308 ---
hi guys,

I think nzdusd is setting up for a good divergence on 1 hour chart.

comments welcome.

thanks

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi

The one hour candle just closed, looks like it is not a bearish candle. But RSI did not make any new high.

So, waiting for a bearish candle formation and if it does, may be then the divergence can be played.

thanks

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi T-Wolf,

Yep, it is me , the same guy that competed in SFTC.  Unfotunately, id didnot go so well cuz i got myself disqualified by making a trade against the rules. Oh well.

But I am glad you are digging this system.  Canucks always welcome

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Yes, we have what looks like divergence on NU, RSI in overbought area, but no bearish candle formation.  Being the Tokyo session, this will be slow moving but who knows, this might surprise us.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi Pure price,.

nice to be here with your simple method

I want to ask you,

am I correct to short on EU?

cause i'm junior, please you teach me how to draw short line?

I'm just able to draw trendline, not the short one like you did and others.

thanks,.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
this is my chart

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hargiyo,  Looks like you are drawing rays. Double click your trendline and go to properties then to parameters and click on the box where it says ray.. You should not have a check mark in the box. Then you can draw your line as short or long as you want it.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi Pureprice and all,

I found your system just the other day and I must say its the most brilliant and simple to understand divergence system I have seen, this one will really entice me onto longer time frames. So well done and thank you PurePrice and others for your contributions.

Was wondering at 1 on my chart do you consider flat RSI to be a valid signal, it did produce a nice trade of 92 pips, but is this coincidence, do you prefer the RSI to be sloping down for short or is flat ok.

I traded the Aussie down (2 on chart) last night altho i know my entry was too early i didn't wait for bearish candle, got excited about the divergence. Had to sit and sleep through a long period before divergence was confirmed but turned into a nice trade with a little help from China this morning.

If people are looking for good exits I find pivots to be excellent for tp1 and tp2. also stop loss if combined with top of candle and a high/low/or pivot it can provide wonderful resistance/suport.

oh and now at 3 divergence and bullish momentum for aussie, anyone going long?

Thanks for input

Julie

Divergence is a great leading indicator if used correctly, but i`ve noticed most people read the oscillators wrong..

If your oscillator is set to "close" then you must measure the closing price of the bar not the high/low of the bar.

Easy mistake, done loads myself. Hope that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi forexubie, sorry i have not seen your question.

I'll try to explain to you and i hope you understand me because i don't speak english very well.

For see a  divergenge, i look the chart like PUREPRICE said, and, for help me, I look the chart with the price line, not with candelstick.

I use that with a resistance with some candelstick.

Yesterday, it doesn't work... but holy graal doesn't exit.

I hope you understand now?

Try this on DEMO first!

edit: look on aud usd at the resistance 1,0442 yesterday... the divergence was'nt clear but, with the priceline, it was look better

Have a nice day!

Here an example nzd usd :

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Good point. This might mean earlier entries... I wonder if PurePrice considered this

Olu

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Good point Gez.

Hi Pure Price,

It will be great to have your take on the oscillator settings and price parameters.

If I have oscillator set to low high, then do i draw the line on the Price action to low high? If I have the oscillator to close, then do i draw the line on the price action from close to close?

Great to hear from you, pure price.

thanks

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi Julie,

You made a good point and I cannot resist replying.

Any change in price action should be reflected by the oscillator accordingly. If price makes new high, oscillator should.

If oscillator does not reflect price action, it is divergence. The oscillator is diverging from what price is saying.

Oscillator does not necessarily have to show the opposite, but as long as it does not agree with the price action, it is divergence.

If RSI is flat, and price has made new highs, it is divergence.

All this are my opinion, I am willing to learn from Pure Price if it is anything different. He is a better trader than me.

thanks

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Switching to line chart could eliminate this mistake as it shows the closing price, not great for entries though.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hi guys,

I had a very good first week of live trading last week using this strategy as my sole criteria for trading.

Some lessons learned:

I made 1 losing trade on the GBPUSD on Wednesday this week. In hindsight it was not a good trade to take - the entry was right on a strong, longstanding and many times respected support/resistance level going back over the last week or 2. My take profit would have required it to break that line and the momentum just wasn't strong enough for that.

New personal rule: no entering trades that depend on the breaking of existing support/resistance to hit TP1.

I am currently trading at 4% risk per trade, it is a small account and  losses do not worry me, as long as the strategy is sound long term. The other thing that came back to bite me was the way I placed my orders. I set 2 sell limit orders each at 2% account risk, TP1 was equal to SL, TP2 was equal to SLx2.  TP1 worked well every time, it got hit, made me money, the end. TP2 is troublesome. I set a trailing stop equal to the amount of pips of the SL, so that as the order moved to profit I locked in a positive return. The problem was that in the course of trying to close at TP2 there was always enough volatility or uncertainty to hit the trailing stop and take a smaller than TP1 level profit.

What I would love to be able to do is set an order so that once TP1 is hit, stop loss moves to breakeven, but as soon as the order clears TP1, the stop is set to TP1. Basically guaranteeing that from that point on no matter what, I've locked in TP1 on both orders.

Until I can work this out I think I will stick to placing 1 order and using TP1 as the profit target. I'm not worried about getting a little extra on reversals that take off, I'd much rather lock in 4% per trade.

TL;DR: This week I will be using a single 1:1 R:R ratio as it would have locked in more profit for me last week.

Thanks very much for all of your ongoing discussion, happy trading for the week ahead.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Vixs, I have been using 1:1 from the very beginning for the very reason you state. With 1-hour charts, most often you are going to get enough bouncing around that it will be difficult to regularly get a TP2. And this ends up actually hurting your R:R. I feel it is better to get the quick TP1 and lock in your full percentage gain. As long as your win/loss rate is at least 50%, you're golden.

Probably ill advised, but I went straight to live trading on this method with my first trade. After two weeks, I have a positive return overall. Hopefully can keep it going and refine my entries a bit better.

Scott

--- 帖子 #325 ---
This is an excellent point and something I thought about a few days ago though I had not yet implemented any changes. I think this coming week I will pay attention to this. Thanks, gez.

Scott

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Thanks for your response Scott. Hopefully next week will see enough solid trading opportunities for some double digit growth.

I've just got to not get excited everytime I identify a divergence, as there is often not a reversal indicator that follows it.

How many bars after your 'divergence' do you wait for a reversal indicator before you cancel it as an invalid trade? Personally I'm happy to wait a couple of bars (though ideally the immediate bar following the new high/lower high or new low/higher/low indicates a reversal) but at some point I just have to look at it and go 'nope, this isn't valid anymore' and walk away.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I think someone asked Pure Price about that earlier, and he mentioned that the signal is probably valid for 3-4 bars but after that, one should move on to another trade possibility. Obviously discretion and experience come into play in that case. I am much more likely to keep looking for the breakout if the immediately following bars are inside bars or similar.

Scott

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yeah, if the trend has lost momentum but hasn't indicated a reversal I stay with it. If it has shown signs of continuing I discard it. I'm in the process of reading the rest of this thread at the moment so I'm sure I'll pick up some insight.

Cheers,

Vixs

I use MYFX for trade management and would not be without it. I paid for the first years license but since then my account with my broker (GO) allows me a free license, they do have arrangements with a quite few brokers.

Anyway MyFx allows me to manage the trade so easily and set tp targets, stop loss moves, trailing, etc etc all with a few easy clicks. It runs outside of Mt4 as a separate interface so is not an ea as such and must have mt4 and MYFx to be running on your pc to function properly. But it is excellent tool for trade management of the kind you are looking for.

An example of a trade, once entered say 0.03 micro lots - with default sl at 30 pips and tp at 50 i then click manage trade,

tp1 0.01  - 20 pips,

tp2 0.01  - 40 pips,

tp2 0.01  - 60 pips

set break even at 20 pips,

move sl to 25 pips behind market price at 30 pips

or whatever you think is good for that trade.

can then walk away from the trade and let it play out.

I use pivots as tp points, sl is preferably just behind previous pivot level and signal candle, move sl once its cleared next pivot level. using pivots we can see exactly where to place tp and sl orders.

I find execution to be very fast, faster than i could do it myself by far, so if price just touches a level for a second it takes the profit and moves the stop so if we get a significant bounce off a pivot as often occurs you have locked in profit.

Regards,

Julie

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi,

with regards to tp targets and split profit taking, I agree its a very thin line and very debatable whether to take profit on full lots or split and let run, I vacilate between both options regularly. So i am going to assess some of last weeks trades to see how they would have performed with each method. Just finished EURUSD.

based on entry at 0.03 lots

Trade 1  tp1 - 30 pips

Trade 2  tp1 - 20 pips

Trade 3  tp1 - 20 pips

Trade 4  tp1 - 30 pips

equals 100 pips at 0.03 lots = $30.

or with tp targets at pivots and moving sl to each pivot once confirmed break and previous tp taken.

same 0.03 lots, tp = 0.01 each time.

Trade 1

tp1 - 30, tp2 - 50, tp3 - 30 = $11

Trade 2

tp1 - 20, tp2  - 40, tp3 - 20 = $8

Trade 3

tp1 - 20, tp2 - 40, tp3 - 20 = $8

Trade 4

tp1 - 30, tp2 -  0,  tp3 -  0 = $3

Total = $30

lol exactly the same,

Ok so results would only have been more if we moved the sl to 10 pips behind or in front of pivot so as not to be knocked out during a retrace back to pivot.

Trade 1

tp1 - 30, tp2 - 50, tp3 - 20 = $10

Trade 2

tp1 - 20, tp2 - 40, tp3  - 10 = $7

Trade 3

tp1 - 20, tp2 - 40, tp3 - 10  = $7

Trade 4

tp1 - 30, tp2 - 50, tp3 - 80 =  $16

Total  = $40

So result is if there is a trade where it runs significantly we would be in front, but is it worth the hassle, each to his own I guess,

Please note pips rounded to nearest pivot for ease of maths, not allowing for spread costs, slippage, late or early entries etc etc. Theoretical only.

Regards,

Julie

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi again, here's my assessment for GBPUSD take profit at tp1 or split and let run.

based on entry at 0.03 lots

Trade 1  tp1 - 30 pips = $9

Trade 2  tp1 - stopped - (-30) = -$9

Trade 3  tp1 - 20 pips = $6

Trade 4 tp1 - 20 pips = $6

Total = 40 pips x 0.03 lots = $12

or with tp targets at pivots and moving sl to each pivot once confirmed break and previous tp taken.

same 0.03 lots, tp = 0.01 each time.

Trade 1

tp1 - 30, tp2 - 45, tp3 - 60 = $13.50

Trade 2

tp1 - (-30) = -$9

Trade 3

tp1 - 20, tp2 - 35, tp3 - 20 = $7.50

Trade 4

tp1 - 20, tp2 - 20 - $4

Total = $16

So a little more profit in this case with split profit taking. Trade 1 actually went for over 100 pips before returning to daily pivot, but I don't use trailing.

Trade 4 technically not really divergence if using gez info of only use close price for candle, but I thought it looked ok for a quickie.

Going to look into theories of close vs high/low for divergence next. I did find one website which says flatline divergence is not as strong as angled divergence. Strongest indication is if price and rsi is angled opposite to each other. Which would make sense to me.

Trade 2 price was flat using close and it didn't follow through so there may be something in that theory.

Julie

Thanks for the info on MyFX Manager, I'll look into that tomorrow (time for some sleep now).

I wouldn't mind the in-trade management at all except that the duration of these trades means that usually some are still playing out while I'm at work and it just isn't practical to micromanage the trades with my phone while I'm working.

Goal for this week is 4 days worth of trading this strategy using a 1:1 RR ratio and seeing what results I come out with. Then I can analyse which trades would have benefited from letting some profits run.

Fingers crossed for many fat divergences this week.

You have some very good trades there, well done!

Actually, right now I'm using RSI divergence to exit trades. They usually come on a very good timing, without too early or too late exits.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Interesting idea. Are you still keeping your stoploss at the other end of the signal bar or is your SL even dictated by the reverse divergence?

How have you found your R:R doing it that way?

Scott

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thanks for the info. What is the cost? Does it do lot size calculation for you for various pairs based on a percentage of your account? That's the thing that always takes me the longest when setting up a trade.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
In this kind of trades I'm keeping my stoploss at the other end of the signal bar.

However, I'm trading the bounces of the trendlines, going with the flow.

Not crucial reversal points of the market.

I have a post ready where I will explain how I do it, but I'm still a junior member, so I can't create threads, yet.

Possible setup in EU according to the 15 min chart.  Obviously, in the larger timeframes, the setup hasn't formed yet.  Any comments?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi Scott,

I checked the website and its $249 py or $85 pq, there is a video intro and a trial for demo accounts available and a list of brokers that will pay for it for you on the website.

And yes it does do lot size if you use the place order method, (i use 1 click with preset sl and tp) but here is a pic of the order page, once you set sl you can change the risk you require and it calculates lot size.

Regards

Thanks, Julie. Looks like a nice tool, but for that amount of money, I will probably continue to do it manually for the time being, at least until I get my account built up a good bit more.

Hello !

Divergence on eur/aud.

I wait a candelstick pattern for enter.

divergence usd chf

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Well USDCHF is entered but I'm not happy with the close of the last bar. A hammer at my entry does not bode well for my short position.

I had a buy order placed on the EURAUD but cancelled it after the bar closed slightly shy of the open of the bar before it. I wanted to see a full bearish engulfing bar but I'll wait and see how this next bar closes.

In the interests of identifying more possible trading opportunities I've checked just about every pair and am watching for possible long positions on EURCAD and NZDUSD, and possible shorts on CADCHF and GBPNZD. So far all of them are very questionable and would take a clear setup for me to take them.

I started to testing, had a look at historical data on about 20 pairs, and this gives as abou 3.7 signal per day since jan 2012. That is quite amazing.

Have a look I think it is a really nice setup

Also quite strange/amazing If you look at the charts on friday and you see div, there is a BIG chance we will open with gap on monday. Go through your past charts and see it for yourself.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
But surely thats the point of divergence, you are always going to be going against the prevailing trend.  Staying out because of news is sensible, otherwise surely just look for hidden divergence instead which should get you back into the prevailing trend.

I am going for it

Buy 08196

SL  08174

TP1 08247 I will see what will happen to candles @ this level

TP2 08300

Reason:

1. Nice bullish engulfing pattern

2. 200SMA acting as a support lol

3, End of the drop from 0,8300

Hey Kempo

How is your nzd goes? mine was stoped, Like cad/jpy I am also long on geepy. I found it usefull to go through all TF from 1H up sometimes H4 shows signal when there is nothing on H1. Same rules just different TF

--- 帖子 #359 ---
hey tomspin;

I am on nzd .

Here i work in H4... my stop loss is 81,50.

for cad jpy, i'm long too.

Yes, sometimes you have nothing in h1 but in h4 yes, and dayli too.

Example for cad jpy, see divergence in h1, h4, and dayli. (for dayli, the candelstick must be closed like PURE PRICE said).

Just woke up and checked the account - USDCHF hit TP and the EURAUD order I cancelled made a strong reversal in what would have been my favour - it's ok though. Discipline. It didn't show me a signal of reversal so it didn't meet my criteria.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
hello SteelerKeith,

I don't know why. oO

I see the same thing with the indicator ichimoku with other traders.

I trade with a real account and with others demo accounts just for see.

Sometimes, there are differences with  candelsticks with the same times frames but with different brokers...

So, for us, the most important is the divergence. If the divergence is clear.

good trades

Hi, just to add a little spice, we can also use MACD setting to see divergence, I have been using MACD for some times and the result was quite good, its all about willingness to wait for the right settings.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hello everyone,

I want to start by apologizing for not keeping up with the thread questions, however, it appears that you are all answering each other's questions, which is great to see.   But, I think the only outstanding question is what settings to use with RSI and how that relates to price and divergence.

I use RSI(7) of the CLOSE, and I look at the full candle including low and high and not just the close of the candle.  The "text book" definition of divergence should dictate that we either change our price to look only at the close of the candle to match the RSI setting, or change our RSI to look at high/low or whatever to match the price candle. I, however do not do that, and that is how this system works, RSI is set to close, but i still look at high/low of candles to determine "custom divergence" if you would care to name it that.

Why would I do that instead of the classic divergence?

Because we do not only look at classic divergence to enter the trade.  We have a few rules that need to be met before we trigger a trade.  Having said that, it makes the rules of entry "unique" and nothing says we have to use anything that is done by the text book. Additionally, which is more important is the fact that one of our rules of engagement is to wait for a pinbar as a candle formation as a signal candle. If you were to think about this one, and check your charts, you will see that there is a considerable percentage of those pinbars that would make a new high/low and then reverse and close on the other side of the pervious peak/trough to where you actually draw the divergence line.  If you were to consider where those pinbar candles CLOSE, you will not get the classic text book divergence, as in the candle close did not make a higher close/lower close while the actual high of the candle made higher high or lower low.  Please see the chart below where the magenta line shows "custom divergence" and the yellow line shows no divergence if you were to look at the candle close.  I hope this makes sense, but if not, feel free to ask more questions.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I got lucky this time and actually happened to catch this one a bit late, but still got in about 5 pips late and managed about 27 pips profit on partial position.  My remaining position got stopped out at BE, but now looks like that same signal pinbar is pushing the price down again and possibly going back down to the big figure of 1.3000

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Just thought I'd post this chart to make you aware of some trendlines that I am watching on EU hourly chart  that may give us a clue where the price might react.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Agreed.   Let's see how this setup will work out.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
check out this pair for a possible setup at the end of this 10:00 am EST candle, which looks like it may close as a bullish engulfing.  with price action forming what looks like a double bottom at previous support point.  Very small divergence, but it may play out nicely with the bullish engulfing.  LEts see what happens with this one.  You can also see divergence on H4 with pinbar on h4 charts (on my platform anyway, and I know that yours may be diffrent as differetn brokers have different open/close time for the H4 normally)

--- 帖子 #389 ---
sell gbp usd now

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Why now?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
We need to break the low of the setup signal candle before we go short.  I can see why you would want to sell now at the high of the candle to get a better price, but price may not drop here and you may have to chase this one for a long time if 1.6000 gets taken out strongly and breakout to the long side.  Yes, 1.6000 is a very big round number that will provide resistance, but it has been tested just previously and it held and this maybe th etime it actually gets broken.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
please cancel GU pending orders if you had entered them.  We now have a higher RSI reading and no divergence anymore.   consider the NU long setup instead as it looks like USD is weak across the board

Hello Pureprice,

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Thanks Olu, nice catch.

GBPJPY  has also had to test 130.00 many times and 130.00 has held up nicely as either support when price going down, or resistance when price was going up.  It might just hold again as reistance here.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi PurePrice, thanks for sharing.

On GBPJPY, if no candle pattern like pin bar or bearish engulfing, would u still look for something else to short?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Go back and look at your charts mate. Mark every div you can find and study PA at these points, pin bars hammers I found railway track very often gives us signal, the best is dojo imo.

Good luck

I took the trade because of doji it is on m30 we are close to TL, 200SMA may be a no no for some but I'll try TP 20p

Dear Traders of this awsome thread!

I want to share an indicator with you that I have found sometime over the Internet. Maybe you know it maybe you don't but it is very effective and useful. It puts your candles according to the RSI on your chart. It is great to see divergences and to see the strength of each candles.

I hope you will find it useful and will make many many pips for you.

Best Regards to all.

I generally would not go that far back to draw my divergence.  I  usually take the two most recent peaks/valleys to draw the lines between.  In your case, you should likely look at H4 instead oh M30 if u want to go that far back

I am not sure I see this correctly but I do not see diveregence in your chart.

Thanks for posting.

In the indicator windows for the indis you posted, it draws "candles"  but they are not exactly the same as the normal price candles in the chart.  What are those candles and how are they calculated and based on what exactly, and why do they look the way they do?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi all,

since i have been trading this divergence style ( and loving it) i decided I might need to check out hidden divergence,

I hope you don't mind pureprice but i think we may need to look at  hidden, to a) help with exits if we get opposite divergence, and b)  trading with trend may give safer trades/ less fakes and in the end more  pips to us.

i found it much harder to get my head around for some reason but hopefully its just clicked in.... so

I think we have hidden divergence on GBPUSD sorry its a bit late notifying.

From my understanding hidden divergence is with trend, price makes higher low but indicator makes lower low.  Has to be with current trend on that time frame. So we have long trend on pound, price made higher low and and indicator made lower low.

If we don't want to talk about hidden I won't mention it again. It can be confusing, its taken me awhile to "get it".

But thanks for everyone's input and help with this divergence trading, its been a great way to really learn divergence.

Regards

Julie

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi Julie,

I use hidden divergence too. I'll like to use it when we have a regular divergence in h1, and hidden divergence in h4.

See the post 374.

For gbpusd, i'm stay out because we have regular divergence and hidden divergence in the same times (h1 and h4).

I prefere look another pair.

good trades.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Dear PurePrice,

This is a 4in1 indicator. If you check the settings of the indicator you will see at the colors that all lines are black. Give them color any you will see that there are 4 CCi lines. One for Low, High, Open, Close. According to these lines position it draws a candle.

That is why it is so effective. Normally when some trader draws a trend line between candles high they do not us the CCi in "High" calculation mode. So the drawn trend line on the CCi will be false. However, here you can draw your trend line however you want. Using the Open price or the closing price, it does not matter cause you can see all 4 ways.

This is the best indicator that I have recently found for trend line drawings.

Basically that is all I know of it =)

If you have any experiences with it please share it =) I am really looking forward for your comments.

Best Regards

--- 帖子 #424 ---
hi guys,

Nice thread PurePrice.

Looked at charts on the way to the end and just notice that you use your RSI(7) in the close of the candle but take the high of it when draw divergences.

Have you tried to put the RSI(7) setup on high ?

Sometimes it makes a bit of differences (for me at least), between taking the trade or not. After i did not take in consideration the S/R, fibo, etc...

The first chart is with setup close, second one High.

Wanted to share it with you.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
thanx for all your hard work on this...

i'm getting a lot of errors when i open this.

what's the conclusion from your backtest?

profitable? 58% winrate?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Try not to focus on the % rate, but the system is profitable as it is yes.

The conclusion is to have a good MM. But every knows that.

I would say after define your entry (plain like i did, or verification candle), you need to have a good exit and pretty much not too far. Most of the time we do operate on the counter trend. Trail is attractive but a lots of whipsaw...

Basically not one answer but if you can manage to take a good exit, it is very profitable.

Gil

Hope did answer your question

PS: it was a fast backtest i am sure, you can do better.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Thanks for posting this.  I was going to cover hidden divergence after the readers got a good handle on regular divergence first.  It seems like the thread readers are making excellent progress with the basic system using regular divergence and it this may be a good time to start talking about hidden divergence, as there seems to be enough interest already.  Hidden divergence is a bit more "confusing" as Julie has already expressed, and it is a bit harder to wrap your head around it.  But really, it is very basic and it is just as mechanical as regular divergence, but somewhat opposite.  Let me explain by comparing the two types ...

When using regular divergence, a trader is looking to open a position against the prevailing trend and basically looking for reversal levels at which regular divergence occurs and possibly signal a counter trend move.  When using hidden divergence, a trader is looking to open a position with the trend in hopes that the prevailing trend will continue from the level of hidden divergence.

When using regular divergence we are looking for a trend to end and reverse.  When using hidden divergence, we are looking for a trend to continue but picking up a position at "pullback" or "retracement" levels within the prevailing trend. For example, If we are in an uptrend, we may look for a hidden divergence setup at the bottom of a rising channel. Thereby we are looking to go Long with the trend, but picking up a position at a retracement level and better price.  If we have bottom of the rising channel and have confluence of hidden divergence, we have better odds that our trade will succeed.

So, what constitues hidden divergence?

In an uptrend, the price will make a higher low, but the oscillator will make a lower low or stay flat.

In a downtrend, the price will make a lower high, but the oscillator will make a higher high or stay flat.

To trade this, you are likely to look for price continuation candle formations, at hidden divergence levels along with possible reactionary price levels such as support/resistance, pivot points, round numbers, channels and trendlines.

I am not sure if I made this clearer or more confusing for everyone

thank you for posting about hidden divergence. So to stay within the methods of your thread, when we are looking for hidden divergence we need not pay attention to the 70 or 30 line on the RSI?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Likely with hidden divergence you are not to be at overbought or oversold levels.  So, yes, we will not look for those 30 or 70 levels with hidden divergence, but if it is there, then that is bonus

Hi Julie

New to this hidden divergence can you post a chart?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I can show you the chart but it didn't play out - there was no momentum for the long during Asia. I took a couple of pips loss on it.

But hidden divergence is now showing again on euro with a doji/pinbar and possible confirming candle developing. I would want a close above S1 though.

The hidden divergence is with the overall trend (uptrend currently) and  price makes a higher low but indicator makes a lower low. As I type its bouncing off the S1 so i am not entering yet.

Julie

Hi Julie,

Hi,

Hope this has not been mentioned before..............

You may find it easier to pick out divergence if you use a line chart instead of the usual bar or candle etc charts

The line chart is based on the closing price, as is normal for the RSI, so you are comparing like with like

This is great for picking out any kind of divergence,

BUT the bar and candle charts are best for analysing price action

There is divergence showing on 4h, 1h and 30m audusd.

Pinbar on 30 min. I'm in a bit late but may be another entry on a pull back to S1.

Ill start testing divergence entry next week, so didnt take the trades, just posting potential trade setups here for now.. Please correct me if im wrong..

I just saw a reversal divergence in the making on H1 gbpusd. Might enter that setup with small lotsize on my main acc, just for the sake of testing.. Will post the outcome if the setup plays out..

Hi All

Can anyone confirm hidden divergence on Eur/Usd and a continuation of the up movement with a wedge forming?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Just wanna follow up on my earlier post. Set buy stop GU at 43 sl at 73 tp open depends on pa at .6100 (if the price reach there of course lol)

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Regular divergence on GU  with pin bar.

div also on  4h

--- 帖子 #458 ---
no sorry i cant see any hidden divergence at the time you posted, on the 1 hour,  but not sure what time frame you were looking at.

Its easier if you can post a chart marking what you think is div so we can see what you are looking at.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Yes looking at 1 hour charts and will post chart in future

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Just found out that there is a div on H4. Might keep the trade a little longer than planned.

Thanks julie.

hello buddies

This the first time to subscribe through this thread and i like it very much

i think there is higher high which is a regular divergence on TF4hr for GBP/usd

i think may be what u mean please confirm .

--- 帖子 #462 ---
welcome fxzullo

yes you are right; higher high on price but lower high on the indicator.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I think divergence is forming on H1.  A beautiful pinbar is forming now.  Comments accepted.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I vote yes for it =)

Nice work to pick out the divergence Kempo .   Sorry I couldnt post earlier. This one had a bearish englufing candle following the post by Kempo (although it appears that he entered early before candle confirmation).  The divergence plus bearish englufing gave a nice short setup around 12823 and trigger below 12820 and SL at 12840 and now is sitting at TP2 at 12780 ( for around 40 pips)

gbpusd Reg div vs hidden - which will win out?

I just got stopped out on my reg div trade from last night. Took my stop then reversed, praps it was a little too close to R1 ggrrrr.

Anyway here is a chart of this weeks pound showing all the divergences i could see. hidden divergence with the trend is the clear winner.

Regards,

Julie

edit:  60 pips trade with trend is actually regular divergence not hidden although it was with trend. so hidden pips was 206 and regular was 76 plus 60 plus the 50 i just missed = 186. so either regular or hidden is great way to trade if we stick to the rules.

Wait for confirmation and place pending order under the signal candle (as PurePrice says)

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Went down this time...

i have no words, if i use words they won't be pretty ones, i have been stalking this short all week, lol omg. i was just looking at eurusd and when i clicked back .... well lets just say take a deep breathe, and move on ... next

--- 帖子 #473 ---
my short trade for GU got stopped lol.. price hit my sl (73=70+spread) and dived when the news came out haha..

ah well need to work out on the sl placement, and yeah move on..

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Did you catch it? Did anyone else?

Lessons i learnt from this trade -

1. i moved my stop closer during the day as it seemed "safe" to do so. My original stop would not have been hit.

2. looking at the trendline the upper wicks make for divergence, might be good idea to keep stop above that while it takes its time to decide. Divergence seems to take a few candles to play out.

3. place entry order when divergence spotted otherwise you can blink and miss 50 pips (apparently)

--- 帖子 #475 ---
thanks for the pointers there julie.

skimming through the majors, some of the have diverged some in the making.

starting to love trading div lol..

--- 帖子 #476 ---
hi,

the first hour in london session ,pair swings more than expected thats the reason it has triggered ur sl.otherwise you catched a highway runner today of bad news from uk.

Div in eurusd H4 but no div on H1.. Quite scary to enter.. What do u guys think bout this?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
reg div in eur usd 15 min time frame is evolved.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Aw got it thanks..

Anyway just asking, whats the max period do u guys take div setup? I mean do u take a div that occurs in the period of like for example 5 days, or less than that?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I am seeing div on 1 hour and nice pinbar

and 4 hour divergence with double/triple top.

I would take it. But I am no expert - still learning this system.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
pretty glad i didn't take it early, thanks to pureprice rule not to take until price breaks signal candle low, that rule is there for a reason and we just saw why!

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I think that zone is a preety strong res zone.. With a div, maybe it will play out nicely.. But yeah need to wait fir confirmation before entering.. Ah nasty spike haha..

Ps: now imo H1 is making a div.. Looks like a potential trade there, i'll keep an eye on that..

--- 帖子 #483 ---
If I may make a first post to this thread. Shorting the Euro is a bit counter trend. A look at the weekly will show bullish engulfing candle rejection of 1.3. Better then to look for the (rarer) divergence play on pull backs to join the overall trend? The trade may well work out. For me, it would not be ideal.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Ah makes sense.. Anyways im in the process of testing the method.. Imo what i can do is take continuation div on the lower tf and look for reversal div on the larger tf.. What do u guys think bout this?

--- 帖子 #485 ---
That's the way to do it.

Incidentally another one has cropped up on the euro...

--- 帖子 #486 ---

Be cautious today as it is FOMC day today and that tends to cause some really nasty reactions in the currency markets and some spikes sometimes, so be careful and trade smartly, as we approarch noon and then 2:0p PM EST today.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Thanks PurePrice you are very correct.  I personnally do not trade at all during FOMC . If I have a trade going I'm out of the trade when it becomes 2 hrs. within the news.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Yeah its whipping up and down for now.. Closed half of my trades and let the rest run..

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Madscientist,

Kempo trades this way, please see post 374 for an illustration and good example

--- 帖子 #493 ---

Yes i just studied the trade kempo showed us and it made about 90 pips, note it was hidden/continuation div on larger timeframe ie with trend and regular divergence on shorter timeframe, not the other way round. This would provide an overall safety of being with larger timeframe trend.

It was hitting upper trendline of the 4 hour when the divergence occurred.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Thanks for the pointers pureprice.. Dunno how i can miss the post..

Anyway just to update yesterdays trade, sl hit for the other half.

Just asking, for example there is an uptrend in H4 with a reversal div and the same reversal div occurs in H1. Is it safe to take the short trade?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
hi

bearish divergence in gbp /jpy in 15 min timeframe.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I think this if for only h1 timeframe.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Ah well, eur usd is developing a regular reversal div on H4, yet again.. See how it pans out later on the day..

I think its good for 40 pips or so, we'll see about that..

--- 帖子 #498 ---
pic of the trade

--- 帖子 #499 ---
That a nice trade to take vasude.. Personally i didnt take that trade because of the spread on gbpjpy on my broker is quite big, not good for my rr..

Still waiting for H4 eurusd pinbar to break..

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Actually this is NOT regular divergence.  The price made a lower high and the oscillator made a higher high, thereby causing a hidden divergence.   As I do not have my platform here, I am not sure what the trend was there so i can't comment on the validity of the hidden divergence setup.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
vasdude,

I notice you take full screen pics and then have to delete/scratch out your account details, just thought you might like to know an easier way.

Once you have your chart loaded full screen in metatrader, click on File, Save as a Picture, active chart as is, save to desktop(or wherever you want) as a gif and then upload to FF. That way you don't get any account details only the chart.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
hello all

i am snapping a div can someone confirm it

--- 帖子 #503 ---
short on aud usd :regular divergence in h1, hidden divergence in h4,near round number 1,0400.

Nice trade there.. Missed the train, didnt really monitor audusd.. Really need to learn to anticipate div from a lot of pairs and focus to the potential ones..

bullish hidden div with possible pinbars developing on EURUSD and AUDUSD

--- 帖子 #506 ---
yes bull divergence in eur usd,but momentum is less.any1 taken this trade.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
eurusd div with double pinbar on H1 and possible div also on H4 with pinbar/doji.

Edit: took another long trade eurusd for the div on H4 at .3216

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Entered at .0397 as per kempo's analysis earlier in the day.

Long eurusd short audusd, aww scary haha..

Edit: closed audusd manually for a couple of minus pips.. Just dont like the momentum that is going on.. And Julie already point out the bullish div, so stupid of me.. Anyway, what do u guys think of correlation between major pairs in taking divergence trade?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
long on usd/jpy :regular divergence in h1

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Quite valid setup.  I would be cautious with JPY trades now with all this talk about BOJ easing etc.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
both those pairs are at critical resistance levels now.   eurusd at the falling daily trendline and sudusd at previous daily resistance level.  Keep an eye on those areas

--- 帖子 #512 ---
have a look at this one :o)

regards

--- 帖子 #513 ---
very nice setup on the EU there Madscientist.   Looks like (in hindsight for me of course) that this trade gained a nice 60+ pips and hit TP1 and TP2 if you held on.  I, naturally, missed this setup due to sleeping   .. (** Note to self ... need to move to Europe or far east to trade propely**)

Happy trading everyone

--- 帖子 #514 ---
What oscillator are you using and with what settings?  Also what time frame are you looking at?

On my platform, it doesnot show divergence with RSI(7) set to Close

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Yeah the economic data that came out from US helped the trade.. Anyway closed all long trades at .3250. Dont want to be greedy, i just take what ive got and run.. Gained 90+ pips for 2 long eurusd trades..

Im outta here, good luck trading everyone.

Ps: saw a reversal divergence on eurusd H4. Price have a tough time breaking and closing above .3260, the trade might work. But its friday and its late already..

Personnally, I prefer stop the trade before a big news.

I am a little gamer....

have a nice week end.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hello,

I know it's different from PUREPRICE's rules...

I just show you what I see.

Good trades

--- 帖子 #520 ---
I dont know about the other broker but theres a reversal div on my chart on H4 eurusd.. Im outside now, ill post the chart later.. Cheers guys..

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Thanks kempo. Basically I just following PurePrice rules of entering, but I seperated H1 and H4 and trade them independently.

Anyway, to follow up on my earlier post, basically H1 chart should be the same as kempo's chart, maybe there is a slight difference on the H4 chart.

Will think about it over the weekend. Cheers

Hi Pureprice,

Thanks for starting this thread. I, by chance, happen to read this thread about a week ago and have started to use it for some for my entry especially when there is a divergence. So far it has help me in my entry.

Also must thank you for explaining hidden divergence which i always find difficulty  understanding.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I trade divergence on H4 using OsMA and stochastics.

H1 is a little harder as there are more fakeouts but candlesticks formation on support and resistance do give a decent run

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Spotted this on the Usd/Cad 30M chart also the 4H chart is showing a divergence. Went long offcourse on a demo account

--- 帖子 #525 ---
very nice system and approach. but i dont rely on paint indicators i more rely on true facts trading.what pit traders and banks do i belive they move the price and not the indicators and they use very few indicators. 50-150 pips per day is more than enough.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Yeah i agree with the fact that the the banks and institutional parties that moves the market. But we only can predict the levels of price that they usually place orders, supply and demand levels etc. but from what i experienced the levels sometimes were ignored ad the fundamentals change ie what the investors think, risk on or risk off and so on. For a newbie like me its hard to incorporate all those things together, still learning up until today. Im glad that you made 50-150 pips a day, it does not often happen to me.gj

For me no matter how much indicators that you use in your trading, it all comes to the basic of price reading ie candlestick analysis. I might use this method to strenghten my reason to enter trades. Maybe i might not catch trades everyday, but my target is around 100pips gain a week, therefore i think its ok for me.

Anyway, did a simple visual backtest run on eurusd for a year, looks good to me.

Took all divergence trade r:r ratio more the 1 for all trades, and i dont filter it with other technicals or fundamentals. Averages 30pc gain per month.. Too lazy to have a detail backtest haha sorry..

stoch 8,5,5 on the 1h (but I also trade on 15min).... I also use rsi 7, I look to take trades into sup/res areas I also like to trade with momentum.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
hi guys.

taken a divergence trade on gbpusd H1, take note that there is no divergence emerge on H4, so its kinda gambling taking this trade.

also kinda have a long bias on gbpusd, but bias has crushed me a lot of time, thus i just trade what i see on the chart lol.

anyway, the pic of gbpusd H1 divergence trade (the bottom one)

--- 帖子 #530 ---
trade taken

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Morning!

well I like that trade, it's got alot of things going for it...

@ a nice big number

@ historical resistance

@ stochs & rsi rolling over on 1h 4h and dailys

@ range upper limits

oh and divergence lol

it is against the trend so not sure if it's a keeper...tp near the daily pivit and leave a bit on the table to run (not not)

kind regards

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hope it goes well. Anyway traded eurusd this morning for the divergence we talked about last friday, but i guess its late to post the screenshot. But it seems to go well, 30-40 pips on eurusd is enough for me..

Regards

--- 帖子 #533 ---
yea I remember very well the chart you showed on Friday did you take the trade? Great going

Regards

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I took one before my broker closes and one more this morning. Its not really following PurePrice's rules (sorry PurePrice ) but i monitored the price from friday's rally and i love the fact that after such a strong momentum upwards price cannot break the .3260-.3270 level and still its a divergence up there. here is the trade on eurusd.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
whats ur target? 3190-3200?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Yep around that level. but its not into the US session yet so will keep the trade and see either they will push the price back up or continue to drop. I'm also eyeing for potential hidden divergence on eurusd H4. Need to be extra cautious here..

--- 帖子 #537 ---
ive been observing these banks drop the euro in the euro session and buy in US session

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Aww bad US data, kinda scared to hold short especially on cable.

Closed gbpusd short trades at .6240.. Still holding eurusd shorts though.

Ok closed eurusd. Saw a hidden divergence on H1 but i dont know it is valid or not.

--- 帖子 #539 ---

--- 帖子 #543 ---
nice trade and it hit the daily pp to a pip :o)

the hidden divergence will be confirmed on a close above the high of the last bar but i'd be looking for abit more on my 15min chart

kind regards

I've attached a chart with a few of the stoch divergences shown

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Pure Price Im seeing this Div. on 1 hr. Could you please give me your opinion. This is on the eur/nzd. It has come back up to almost touch previous S/R area.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Very weak.... I would not trade this just because I have to look "too hard" to see it

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Taken eurusd long on the break of the pinbar. Also waiting for gbpusd to break the pinbar.

Just asking, is stock showing the same divergence as rsi?

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Thank You for your response!!!!

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I don't see any divergence on eurusd stoch or rsi? can you put up a chart...

--- 帖子 #549 ---
or a pin bar for that matter?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Neither do I actually ...   what TF are u looking at Madscientist?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Im sorry im outside right now. But u can try to find the divergence. The low of 27th of april and todays low..

Looks like a flat line on the rsi

Regards

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Same here, unless we are looking at different TF, or another currency pair

--- 帖子 #553 ---
AAAH, you are talking Hidden Divergence. I think we will need to be more specific from now on and indicate which type of divergence we are looking at. We will call them either 'Hidden Divergence" or "Regular Divergence"

We all know that both of those are actually "custom divergences" becuase we use Close on the RSI but look at the hi/low of the candle itself ... This is not to confuse the issue of course but to be specific

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hmm, I should have listened to my own advice on this one     I hope somebody did

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Aww sorry i didnt specify the divergence.. Anyway pureprice, do the setup valid if i took it?

--- 帖子 #556 ---
booked profit on Gbp/Usd short taken earlier on in the day

--- 帖子 #557 ---
It was a hidden divergence setup yes.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
good work

--- 帖子 #559 ---
thanks man.. cheers

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Gracias Pure Price!

So here´s my little contribution:

Take 2 trades on each valid setup-(H and 4 H)

Trail (auto)  stop from the other end.

Each TP at 1 R and 1,5 R respectively.

Basically it´s the originall idea (correct me if I´m wrong)...except for the auto trail, which has advantages and disadvantages.

It will reduce the size of the loosers, BUT, it will sometimes kick you out on winners.

In theory, by the time you hit  first TP you should be at BE on the second leg.

( Brokers love to hunt trailing stops though...)

Extra bonus, set it and forget it...less work.

I will run it with mini postitons, real money, for 2 weeks or 30 trades.

Will post results for everyone to evaluate..

Having the system split in 2, we could get a fair idea of which TP is more profitable..

Sure 3o trades and or 2 weeks is a very small sample...better 1000 trades...but have to start somewhere.

I have pending orders on H USDJPY and GBPJPY (I know they are correlated and it´s Labour day...still I´ll run them if hit)

Enjoy Labours day

--- 帖子 #561 ---
keep an eye on Eur/Jpy and Gbp/Jpy looks like there might be long trade setups coming in the next few hours

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Also regular divergence to go long on gbpusd on both H1 and H4.

Edit: oops sorry its a hidden divergence on H4 and regular divergence on H1.

Beware of big spread and stop hunting on Labour Day...(Broker don´t sleep)

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Wow quite a potential pin bar on gbpjpy. I think its still tradable later in the day. Did setup buy stops above the doji+pinbar sl couple of pips below todays low, will update if it plays out.

Regards

--- 帖子 #570 ---
gbp/jpy bull divergence is almost forming ,so any1 going long on this pair on labour day

--- 帖子 #571 ---
true but unfortunately there wasnt a great bullish candlestick confirmation

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I did lol. Hit buy stop at .29 just now. Counter trend trade is kinda killing me but hmm but indeed market dont care what im thinking so i just go for a long trade here haha..

hi guys

long triggered in gbp.jpy

what about gbp .usd is shaked by negative data.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Yeah but for me im looking for a deviation of 2.0 (quoting from henry liu's website) on the data for gbp to go with strong momentum. So i will be eyeing on usd's ism figure later.. But anything can happen, i just need to figure out some 'if then' plan here for gbpusd to take some pips out of the market.. Cheers guys

i'm currently short eur/gbp and bearish with the euro in general. lots of div about today best of luck everyone.

closed half for a nice little proffit letting the other half run with stops at b/e

slooooooow day

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Looks like (on my patform at least) that there is a bearish hidden divergence forming on eurgbp on H4 with pinbar forming for now.  I do not talk about H4 much because different brokers are likely to have different candle start/complete time and thus will look different.  The pinbar candle has made a lower high in a downtrending channel however, the candle is nto closed yet and anything can happen, especially with Europe being on holiday today too.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi Guys,

Looks like there is a divergence in EURAUD. Classic divergence for a sell. Comments welcome.

Have to go to work, no time to attach the chart.

thanks

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I would like to thank the posters for posting potential setups and actual trades and keeping the discussion going and this thread alive. Keep it up guys and gals because that is how we all learn

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Same here. I also want to thank to you guys for helping me learn about this method. I'll be posting my trades till god knows when, hope you guys will drop comments for me. Thanks and cheers guys.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
If you trade M15, take a look at eurjpy for short divergence setup  right at 1.0600  which was previous support now should be resistance

--- 帖子 #586 ---
hey PurePrice have you tried using the Macd divergence apart from the Rsi?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
thanks for taking the stand first and starting this thread

--- 帖子 #588 ---
long setup confirmed on Usd/Jpy any takers?

--- 帖子 #589 ---
For the "most part", it gives the same outcome, but some traders like to see both divergence at the same time as a double confirmation. I normally only look at RSI.  But again, you are free to make this system your own, and add/take away what you like to be comfortable with trading it and be confident in the system.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
hmmm, not sure i see what you see, cuz I dont see anything that signals a long on USDJPY, unless you are referring to the setup from 5 hours ago on H1

--- 帖子 #591 ---
EU seems to be stalling around the 1.3275 area again.  Looking at RSI thus far, it appears to be making a lower high while the price is at the previous level of 1.3275 (creating divergence) which happens to be the touch point on the daily falling trendline. This makes this level interesting to watch for a possible price rejection and break down if the trendline holds. But, we may alos get a price breakout to the upside to possibly touch 1.3300 and may get some resistance there in the short term.  I would say keep an eye on this area between 13275 and 13300 to see if we get a potential short setup.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
AU M30 forming Bull Div, H4 seem just started to play too

--- 帖子 #593 ---
the trade from earlier. its seems like its hard to break the .50-.60 area.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
That is a good trade, and it might be that EJ is having trouble with 10600 that is keeping GJ down too.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Aww make sense. I also saw a hidden divergence on gbpusd with a tweezer (that;s what I called it lol), might play it, and I'm expecting gbp pairs will go up even for a while.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
hit tp at .80. ah well enough for me today. how about you guys, still holding gbpjpy trades?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
also got enough from eu,gonna take a rest

--- 帖子 #598 ---
tmr will focus on the ADP non-farm to see how it goes

--- 帖子 #599 ---
hmm, it seems that EU, GU maybe setting up to go long again ?!

also USDCHF setting up to go short ...

Not sure if those will play out as that 10:00 oclock bar was pretty huge due to ISM Manufacturing numbers being good for the greenback, but we may be lucky later on

--- 帖子 #600 ---
another good day at the office :oD

I don't look at 4h much simply because its easily interpreted  from the 1h...i do look @ daily

*On entries*

I look for enrties off s&r with divergence and pa (entry should be on the confirmation of an expected action..... not a reaction)

lol I just made that last bit up! sounds good though!

--- 帖子 #601 ---
not for me its to late in the day.

I'm closing my eurgbp short as i expect a little bouce at the pivot and I'd like to be out for the night.

regards

--- 帖子 #602 ---
trade worked beautifully my 3rd consecutive profit

--- 帖子 #603 ---
here's what i saw

--- 帖子 #604 ---
well done

--- 帖子 #605 ---
This one might be good for a potential short setup because:

1- we have hidden divergence with the trend

2- price at previous support now should act as resistance

3- price at the upper boundary of a falling channel/trendline

4- we may get a pinbar here to signal bearish bias (30 minutes to go still)

5- Everyone seems to be kicking some ass today, so why not

--- 帖子 #606 ---
y,waiting for a confirmation candle

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Thanks PurePrice for the insight. I'll keep an eye on the trade, looks promising..

--- 帖子 #608 ---
I like this one the most, but it is gonna be NY lunch soon and London is closing down for the day on a bank holiday in Europe, just not good timing ... so ttake it for what it is worth.  But, just to show the pretty setup I guess, here is the chart as I see it

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Just reverse the above for a EU setup also .. I am getting too lazy

to post the chart setup as I am sure u guys are more than capable of looking at EU

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Ermm wow I noticed after the US ISM news rally, there are a lot of pairs showing  very potential divergence trade. Eg like PurePrice stated, most divergence occurs at a critical levels (round numbers, sup/res lines/channels and so on). Can we some sort like correlate one pair to the other?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
well good day for all in gbp.yen with the help of ism data.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
gbpjpy,eurgbp moves in different direction and eurusd,usdchf what else pair.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Yeah. Same direction but at a different rate.

Anyway hope that you guys end the day with green pips. I did set up some small size stop orders for some pairs (divergence trades) and just leave it alone for tonight. Cheers guys.

where can i find this RSI (7) can tell me? thank you sir !

--- 帖子 #617 ---
it simply the RSI indicator but change the period to 7......

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Divergence and short setup on the 1H on GBPJPY. Still time to get in this one as it went the expected direction initially but has since come back to the entry and then some.

Gbpjpy also showing a hidden divergence on H1 and constuction pmi is 15 mins away.. But the downwards momentum os still strong imo.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
hi,

in gbpusd double bottom in progress.wait for another 30 min to finish candle.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Oh darn now im gambling..

Entered gbpjpy at .18, round number, divergence with potential pinbar. Awwww...

--- 帖子 #627 ---
have you entered long or short and off what time frame? I don't see anything that makes me want to risk my money

--- 帖子 #628 ---
pending buystop at 130.17 in gbp/jpy . news done a bad thing.what about ur position madscientist

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Im on a long trade from .18.. Sorry i didnt clarify what trade im taking. Im taking from H1 gbpjpy. As i said just now im sort of gambling on the trade. And still holding the trade until now.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
what is ur stop loss level.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
I set my stop loss at .87, around 40pips from my entry. Thought if the price breaks there its hard to go back up.

Edit: 1 pip from stoploss. Price will touch it eventually. Ah well lesson learned, dont bloody gamble on forex..

--- 帖子 #632 ---
true, just trade with the rules after all its hard earned money mate

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Yeah.. Need to be more discipline after this. Anyway just curious, why is it when usd getting stronger, yen is going down?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
If the USD gets stronger, everything else that is paired with it gets weaker

For example if you look at USDJPY, then if traders start demanding USD and going long on USDJPY, then that means they are buying USD and selling JPY.  This may have a ripple effect on EURJPY and then possibly GPBJPY, and so on.  That is why when you enter any trade you do not want to enter multiple correlated pair trades since you would be increasing your exposure and thereby increasing your risk.  Because very likely, as you will notice that if a trade fails on one USD pair, it is very likely to fail (or come very close to it) on the other pairs at the same time.   If I want to have more than one position open on diffrent pairs, I divide up my lots so that total of all trades equals my risk %, not each trade, but the total of open positions.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
watch this pair around 0.8120, as it is struggling with it, and appears that it has put in divergence.  We still need bullish candle formation and confirmation.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Thanks for the explanation. Appreciate it..

--- 帖子 #637 ---

Line break is also good setup. I saw many times when trying to spot divergencies.

i'm watching gpy/gbp for a long op around 129.70

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Wait for div to play

--- 帖子 #641 ---
oops, I forgot to add the most important thing here, which is risk appetite and risk aversion, which are generally judged by USD and JPY.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
i forgot to mention the short setup on USDJPY a few minutes ago, but it looks like it already moved a good number of pips (likely due to APD non-farm announcement)

--- 帖子 #643 ---
thanks 2013  i've been doing this a long time I'm just highlighting areas that new traders should be watching! there is div but without the right reaction/conformation it's worthless or expensive lol

will look for gbpusd sup @ s3 and see what we look like from there

regards

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I agree with you on GU , the div pattern is playing now. GJ@129.70 you mention is the place to be highlight as you say. Let's see how it react.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
dont know when the gu goes up ,but the div looks valid to me , agree?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
16150-16160 area should be interesting to watch as that is previous support/resistance area, and we may get a setup there

--- 帖子 #647 ---
yeah s3 is 61561 :o) i've got hidden and regular div on stochs and rsi I'm nolonger interested in gbpyen

--- 帖子 #648 ---
also usdcad audusd are on the watch list regards

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I have got in at 16180 - on close of the bullish engulfing ( I am pretty sure it was a BE). Was this a wise thing to do? thanks :-)

--- 帖子 #650 ---
I wanted more of a reaction... I like to look at 15min chart for entry and....i'm still looking.

regards

--- 帖子 #651 ---
not strong enough i think , can still do a small short before long

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Thanks for reply - so you look for a pin bar of engulfing pattern on the 15 min chart (but not divergence)  after identifying the same pattern (and divergence) on the 1h chart initially?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
also when your lookng for a PA entry the most important thing is to assess the bar relative to the previous few bars (size does matter with pa) your bullish eng was smaller than the bearish down bars!

hope this helps

Nathan

--- 帖子 #654 ---
We have divergence established

We have a bullish engulfing candle stick pattern

The above two things should indicate a possible reversal around this level, which as I mentioned earlier is a previous resitance/support level at which we "expect" a pause in price, so this area makes sense to have a possible setup.

However, I normally would like to wait for PA confirmation after the price breaks the high of the setup candle by a few pips, which is yet to happen.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I enter off both 15min and 1h charts in much the same way. I trade with divergence, range, sup & res and volume.

I like to enter on 15 min range extremes within a 1h trend

& 15 min/1h range extremes for counter trend

pa & volume entry also touch sup&res entry

I've not really got the time to go into it now but it's very similar to whats going on here :o)

kind regards

--- 帖子 #656 ---
thanks very much - very helpful

think it has now just broken the PA bar...

--- 帖子 #657 ---
I agree.... and what I said in the above post (size matters....)

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Keep eyes on AU guys could be a nice hammer

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Good job guys for gbpusd setup, looks good. Personally i didnt take the trade, closed my trade day early, dont want to be taking some more stupid trades like i did earlier. Some kind of self punishment eh haha.. Cheers guys and green pips to all.

Regards

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Agreed.  Be cautious of the 10300 figure though as it may present some resistance and price might struggle to break above it in short term

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I struggle (like many others) to know where to place my TP. Should I just aim for 1xAL, 2xSL, at obvious S/R zone etc..

I find as price pauses/drops a little I also end up bailing out... only for it to carry onwards and upwards... (in case of a long :-))

--- 帖子 #662 ---
aus/usd  nzd/usd and usd/cad

--- 帖子 #663 ---
always the big question... many answers and the all depend on what your expecting from your trade and what your stop is etc etc

try slpitting your trade in 2, 1st tp at say 1xsl or s&r then letting the other run until xxxx you get the idea.

we could be hear all day on this one, but as they say it's not jumping out of the plane that kills you it's the landing!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
thanks - will give that approach a go

:-)

--- 帖子 #665 ---
stop 3 pips below the low of the hammer.

Might get another AU long setup soon .. looks like it is diverging for now arounf the previous lo of 1.0285 for now.  Lets watch and see

--- 帖子 #669 ---
also a double bottom has formed on the 1H chart

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Not sure that it has the momentum to drive very high - will also hit downward trend line- just something to be wary of

--- 帖子 #671 ---
AU Bull div play on

GU soon

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Not seeing that at all - can you post a chart?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
I think he's expecting gu to drop a little bit below yesterday's low. If it does, we might see a divergence but quite a strong rejection aroung the .60 level. So no divergence for now.

Or maybe he's using 1st may low as a divergence? Can 2013 clarify about this? Thanks..

--- 帖子 #674 ---
see eur/usd double bottom in progress may go long in ny session

--- 帖子 #675 ---
I check H4 for confirm then see H1 start playing

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Looks promising divergence and pin bar on USD/CAD 1H

--- 帖子 #677 ---
its also happening in xauusg

Olu

--- 帖子 #678 ---
In case you were not aware of this, there is market moving events coming up in about 45 minutes in the form of ECB press conference, which usually tends to shake the market, and no technical analysis, no matter how good it is, is going to hold if the conference brings on any surprizes.

There is also ISM manufacturing out of the USA about 1.5 hours after that.

Also tomorrow, big NFP announcement, and that also tends to move the market in nice spikey fashion.

There is a few setups in play now with the USD pairs, but i would not take on any positions until after the press conference, but that is just me, and you trade what you feel comfortable with and whatever way you feel is best for you.

Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
If next candle close below pin bar's open its a fake signal imo, we need to be above to confirm

--- 帖子 #680 ---
uhm, I dont normally trade daily charts or usdjpy, but there is a nice setup that is actually already in play on this pair going LONG.  again, with different brokers we will have different candle close time and you might have different looking daily chart.  On mine, there was divergence in oversold RSI along with a bullish engulfing candle on May 1st, making this a valid setup at a good reversal area of 79.60ish where we have had price reversals before.  The price has gone up above the high of the bull englufing candle, has retraced a bit, and is now goign up above it again ... this may be a nice long term play once the news is over ... lets keep an eye on it for the long term

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Agree. Impact http://news<img data-emoji="grin" al...1.png?v=15.1">

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Great advice - thanks.

There are a lot of announcements each day - I know the NFP is the main one to avoid and also major interest rates. What others should we avoid?

Looking at the FF calendar there are 20 per day - do we avoid all red ones?

Many thanks

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hey PurePrice and Co

I am am a newbie to divergence trading but realy enjoy the simplicity of this strategy....

Would I be right to wait for the possible long and short trader setups for CHF and EUR? - see attachements below.

Thanks for your advice Ez.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Good Catch, Ezmi.

I think usdchf is a good setup. Just wait for price action to go a few pips below the bearish candle.

But beware of the support just below.

thanks

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Thanks Forexnubie - I hope so!

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Good question, Blue Mosaic.

I have not been a great fan of this news stuff. There are news everyday, and if you have to stay away, you can trade only once a week or once a month, if you have to choose a day without news.

My point is this. News, usually does not change the trend of the pair. It does on occasions, but I would emphasize more on the trend of the pair, than the particular news.

Even if there is a move after the news, it retraces and many times resumes the original trend. May be very big news like NFP, may be good to stay away, but if you hesitate because of the news, you will never be trading.

Me, personally, I dont care about the news, I concentrate more on the trend of the pair. One news changing a weak currency that has been weak for months to strong one in 15 minutes because of one unemployment news, I dont believe in that.

To wrap it up, except NFP, if your stop losses are properly placed, I wont care about the news.

Just my 2 cents.

thanks

--- 帖子 #687 ---
- is this another one?

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Again, Very close to support.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Ah yes - thanks you - just redrafting my trading plan......

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Good points. However, I think I need to clarify one thing about news. When i said be careful and avoid news, it does not mean not to trade the whole day. What i meant was do not enter into a new position just before or right at news time, unless you have a large stop loss in place and can wither the storm.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
potential setup (bearish) on EUR/JPY if current bar closes as pin:

I played short trade eurusd divergence on H1. Sorry cant post screenshot now, still outside. Anyone also take the trade?

--- 帖子 #696 ---
this might be where nzdusd will slow its recent slide and get a nice bounce up off the big figure of 0.8000, but watch and see

--- 帖子 #697 ---
...the third included.....

--- 帖子 #698 ---
it seems tht GU is finally moving above the H1 pinbar and divergence that many posters have talked about earlier. However, it appears there is a falling trendline on H1 that is keeping the Cable down for now. I think if we get and close above 1.6200 decisively, we may have a good shot at a long trade, as that means that the trendline is also broken to the upside and potential breakout

--- 帖子 #699 ---
sell? thats a strange place to want to sell?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Testing another strategy.....daily box trade.......

--- 帖子 #701 ---
you should take a look @ eurcad (1h & 4h shows it best!) perfect little trade :oD

--- 帖子 #702 ---
thats fine but to enter at just wrong side of a big number like that is asking for downdraw with very little gain esp on a daily strat .....imo

kind regards

testing is good though :o)

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Cable gets bitch-slapped at exactly the previous level just above 1.6200 around 1.6210 and can't hold above the figure (for now)

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Noted. Your opinion matters a great deal, thank you. Much in the way of green today?

Ez.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Lets hope things will pick up after NY lunch and not wait till tomorrow morning NFP numbers

--- 帖子 #706 ---
yeah I did ok :oD i'm still holding afew trades namely gbpusd.... 1st tp @ the pivot (15min entry) 2nd half of the trade stopped out at break even... re-entered @ s1 etc and did it all again lol  locked in profit and will sit on it for a while (if possible).

have a nice weekend all, I'm off to Bilbao for a friends stag..... it's going to be a looooong weekend

Thanks and enjoy the long weekend.

Well done you - enoy your weekend - I was in San Sebastian last few weeks - the North is beautiful.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
I have been looking for quite a while now to find a reliable thread on divergence without to many indicators and I now think I have found it.

If you dont mind Pure Price I will join you in this thread to hopefully start to make some pips.

To date I have only ever lost money in forex but from now I feel confident that this is about to change.

By the way do you trade on NFP DAY.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I avoid Nfp day as Market usually dead up to announcement and then erratic after. Saying that, there is opportunity at that point for the risk taker

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Thanks bluemosaic

As you are uk based the same as myself what time do you normally trade this method and what pairs do you use.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Hi

Yes am in UK - In west/south west. Where are you?

I trade this method between around 8am and 8pm UK time. This tends to be when I am in front or near a computer anyway

I tend to stick with main pairs e/u, u/j, usd/cad, usd/chf, aud/usd, nzd/usd, eur/gbp etc.. Not so keen on g/u but will sometimes look at it. Tend to stick to pairs with max 3 pip spread on my broker - igindex.

Have only been trading this method for past month but really like it so far. Have been trading forex on/off for past few years with limited success...

cheers

--- 帖子 #713 ---
I am 6 miles from the centre of Exeter.

Thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Welcome aboard, and I hope that this is what you are looking for and that you are here to stay  .. good luck with your trading.

I would trade carefully, and just be aware that price maybe spikey around NFP announcment time + 1 hour.  and before that, market usually is dead until the announcement.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hi Pure Price,

I knew you meant that on the news. I totally agree with you on that.

This is one of the good forums and I appreciate traders posting setups without deviating from the original method.

We should make this one of the most active forums in FF.

One of the best methods, very simple, well thought out by PurePrice.

thanks

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Good afternoon guys.. Quite a quiet day today eh.. Any thought on today's trades? Still holding short trades on eurusd and eurjpy for yesterday's divergence.. Going good on eurjpy but still stalling on eurusd..

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Morning all.  Market very quiet pre-NFP announcement later. I might take a look at the market after the announcement but into Friday afternoon/weekend, the market becomes quiet anyway. Also there is a bank holiday here in the UK on Monday so markets will be closed.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Oh I didnt know UK will be on holiday on Monday. Yeah the calm before the storm, thats what people say.  Anyway here's the trade I took from yesterday on eurusd. I'm not sure if it falls into divergence category.

Please, feel free to comment, thanks.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Thanks for posting. I notice that the RSI divergence start point was not below 30. Do you take any divergence or normally keep to the < 30 or > 70 rule used within this thread?

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Oh no looks like I messed up. I didnt know that PurePrice only take divergence in OB/OS territory. Thanks for the point out, need to study more.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
The divergence shown is hidden/continuation divergence - with trend so does not need to have the 70 30 rule. That rule, i believe, is for regular divergence which happens at end of trends ie extremes. PP posted about this once we started talking about hidden.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
AU Bull div forming@H4

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Thanks for making it clear.

Anyway, looks like another regular long trade divergence came out on eurusd H1. Hard day to trade today eh. Will close shorts and open long if the price reach 1.3140. If not then I just hold onto the shorts.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Very risky......very silly perhaps.....but I am testing.....

+15 on NZD and +15 on AUD...

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Aww slow nfp reaction. Anyway eurusd short hit sl for about +16. Open long to play the other bullish divergence. I entered quite late but well why not.. Opened at .3147 sl 30pips below.

Hope it turns out good for me. Cheers

--- 帖子 #726 ---
My fingers are crossed for you!!

--- 帖子 #727 ---
very good thread, thanks.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Just want to update on the trades I took just now when I when to have some dinner (sorry can't post my trades on the spot). Closed long for like +11pips,not much.

Its scary to see such a kick on the resistance. After that saw a little divergence on eurusd (note that 1st top on the price is higher and 1st top on rsi is lower), I took the trade at the bottom of the small candle.

I'm not sure the middle candle is categorized as a reversal candle/pattern. Just for scalp, Ill close it when the price goes near .3100. Cheers guys and have a nice weekend)

Edit: closed all position.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Slow ending to the week. Didn't see any trades I liked over the last couple days. But at least I ended the week a little bit positive. Hopefully see some more opportunities next week. Have a nice weekend, all!

Hey folks nice and active thread right here. From my backtest this year I have been getting good results with 75% win rate for 6 pairs on average, with 1% risk pertrade it got me 30% to date this year.(I am now forward testing to verify statistics) I just want to bring up an observation. I notice the Range Breaker method from Razorman which PurePrice drew his inspiration from draws his trend line from the close or open of the bars NOT the wicks. I notice many of you drawing from the wicks

For a while I have been trying to figure out why and I realize that the RSI you guys are using is calculating from the close/open of the bar not the wick. An equally important point, divergence detects trend deceleration which signals a trend change. So it makes total sense to draw TLs from the close/open not the wicks. Because if we measure from the wicks the RSI won't necessarily detect the deceleration.

If you don't understand me I will bring up some charts....

I look forward to hear from you all.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Hi, everyone.. This is my first post.

Possible trade on EURNZD: pinbar and bearish divergence on stochastic oscillator. TF- daily.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
In GY there was a div with a bullish engulfing for a trigger. I missed it, I was having lunch.(I should start trading it off my IPAD)

This is a good example to point out the fact that divs indicate deceleration. Notice the difference between the gradient of the yellow trend line and the red one? Well that it self triggered the divergence.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
You should also draw divergence from the same points on both the chart and the indicator to tell if there is divergence or not, your points in that chart are not drawn from the same.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Hi Binyamin.

May I ask, when you're doing the backtest, did you take the divergence including the wicks or only took divergence from the open/close of the candles?

Anyway, I saw a bearish hidden divergence in the making on gbpusd H1.. Will keep an eye on that..

Edit: opened a short trade on gbpusd at .6133 sl around .6160..

--- 帖子 #738 ---
I draw my TL only from the open/close in my backtest. Nice spot in GU btw. There is a double top in M15 too.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Yeah I am confuse to what you are trying to say. Care to elaborate?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Thats ok, I was looking at the yellow line on your chart compared to the red one on the indicator, I didn't notice the red one on the chart as well.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Hit sl. Ah well no problem..

audusd is making a hidden divergence. Just need to wait for some kind of conformation..

--- 帖子 #742 ---
AU looks good it is at a daily pivot with a round number 1.02. I will definitely take it if the right trigger occurs.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Welcome to this thread whydak.

re: EUR/NZD - I do not see a trade on this pair - not seeing divergence or a good looking pin bar

hope this helps

cheers

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi MadScientist.

Just not seeing this setup on charts. Would you be able to post a chart to show me?

thanks

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Here

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Thanks for the post. Actually I'm outside for now, having drinks with my friends. Anyway yeah thats the setup, but just wait for any reversal conformation. Like binyamin says, maybe we'll get a nice setup around 1.02 round number.. Cheers

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Thanks both - Makes sense now.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
I saw it on daily time frame (not 1H), and I also use stochastic oscillator (not RSI).

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Just asking, is there any way we can post screenshots from iphone/ipads/android phones? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
it appears that we might get potential setups on a few USD pairs for hidden divergence

GU looks the most promising as it is just at the upper boundary of a falling channel around 1.6170.  Looking for short setup then trigger sometime in the next couple hours into NY session.

Similar setups on both AU and NU also.  Draw your trendlines, and look for hidden divergence wit RSI

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Thanks for the backtest results.  This is very encouraging indeed.   Please let us know how your forward test results turn out.

Yeah plenty of them. Did enter usdcad for a long trade at the break of the small candle. Watching gbpusd if I can get a better price to short, missed the pinbar break in m30.

Edit: usdx is also showing a divergence to go long (im using trade interceptor to monitor usdollar)

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Please check out post #381

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Trade interceptor?  What is that, sounds very fancy

--- 帖子 #755 ---
A lot of time I was away from my trading computer. So I used to trade from my phone. There is a charting/monitoring apps called trade interceptor. I dont know if they can be used at the computer, but you can try and google it.. Cheers

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hmm no idea...

NP, I have to mention that from backtesting I find that in order for me to avoid certain losses I have to actively manage my trades like bringing the SL to BE once price has gone some distance and penetrated an important area for example.

In doing so in my backtest I happen to usually bring my SL to break even half way to the first profit. I also have to add that if I couldn't visually see any evidence of price deceleration and RSI happen to show a divergence I will ignore any trigger. I don't know if it will be a good idea in the long run.

I hope more people do their backtest too so that we can verify from each other. Beware of biases when you backtest though.

Last night i started to trade this good KISS strategy and my result till now is 5 trades and all 5 trades were winners.I am using different mm but think that this strategy is winner in long run.

eur/usd:+30

usd/chf:+20

usd/jpy:+17

nzd/usd:+18

aud/usd:+30

Overall score:+ 115 pips

Thank you Pure price!

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Can you post some charts on your trades.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
That is great.   Do you mind sharing your mm strategy with the group here, as that is a very important aspect of trading?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Are you using H1 only? If not what other timeframe are you using. I can't see any trades today....

--- 帖子 #761 ---
here you go

--- 帖子 #762 ---
I am really sorry Pure Price i am working with some guys and our mm is secret so i cannot talk about it,I promise them not to tell.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Yes only H1 but as I said have really good mm so i can easy cover my losses and not afraid entering in trades anymore + with this nice strategy you should be fine in long run

--- 帖子 #764 ---
What does mm mean.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
mm=money management

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Cancel the GU short setup as it appears GU is making higher highs and not stopping at the channel for now.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
this pair looks really interesting at 1.0200 where if we get a short setup, wee have double divergence both hidden and regular. if you take the 2 most recent peaks, you will see regular divergence where the price made a higher high, but RSI mades a lower high. If you look back to May 4th, you will see that the price made a lower high (going with the down trend), but RSI made a higher high resulting in hidden divergence.

Let's see if we get a bearish candle formation here to allow us to go short

Edit:  Forgot to add that AU is just at the falling trendline also, so a good place for it to get rejected.  Lets see if it happens.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Also there is a potential divergence on H1 gbpjpy. Been eyeing for like 6 hours but keep making higher low.. H4 also indicates that divergence is in the making..

129.30 is quite tough to break, but imo the strong resistance lies around 129.50, descending TL of the downtrend.. What do you guys think about it?

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Nice spot, AU is at a trendline too, so if it rejects the Tl with a pin coupled with hidden div, that will be ok to enter.

Not to mention Au is in a down trend now.

You are not the only one going through such insanity

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Haha  Glad we're the same. I thought only me who're close to going mad here.

Anyway, gbpjpy H1. Dunno if the trendline is right, comments will be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Yep, there is a falling trendline in GBPJPY and the price around 129.50  maybe a good one to watch for a rejection down, as it appears we have a hidden divergence in the making (for now anyway)  BUT it seems like the other pairs are not respecting the trendlines for today, so I am not holding my breath on this one :|

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Do we normally get trades posted through out he day uk time for this method.

Say from 7am to 4pm.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
NZDUSD H1 Divergence. It is near a swing point at 2011/12/8.

The problem is NU is in a strong downtrend so if I enter with a trigger I will be quick to take profit.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
For me I usually trade from europe/london session till around lunch time for ny session as I'm living in gmt+8 area.. Dont know about other guys here..

--- 帖子 #775 ---
If the divergence plays out I think it will be good for around 30-40 pips. What do you guys think about it?

--- 帖子 #776 ---
yes - usually at least a few a day - depends on whether there are good quality setups.

I trade 8am-8pm (UK time) so will aim to post if they occur

--- 帖子 #777 ---
What points should I be looking for, for a good quality setup.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
1. Good divergence between price and RSI - and RSI should be in overbought/oversold zone (< 30, > 70) preferably

2. Nice candlebar setup - bull/bear engulfing or pin bar.

3. price in a zone of interest - important previous support/resistance (horizontal or trend line), round number eg.. 2.00, 3.00, 3.500

4. be patient - don't take lower quality looking setups

Check out first few posts of this thread - this should provide you with main info.

hope this helps

cheers

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Do your own backtest and find out. It is just responsible trading. I prefer london and NY session because I want fast moves.

I haven't verify but common sense tells me that  divs at a trendline or previous swing points in the daily is a good signal to take too.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Potential setups on: G/U (Long) and N/U (Long)

Waiting for good candlebars to form

--- 帖子 #781 ---
NU, yes but there is nothing in GU. It is neither a hidden div nor a regular div.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Also there is a potential long setup on GBPJPY H1, waiting for some conformation candle. But be careful as the downwards momentum is still strong.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
This is what I see (bullish div) on G/U - so waiting to see if candle forms and downward momentum v. strong so need to take care...

Any comments most welcome - thanks.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
That is definitely not a bullish Div.

In a regular div the indicator lead the way. This is not the case.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
That is really useful to know - so:

1. Regular divergence - indicator is used to find divergence and confirmed on price

2. hidden divergence - price is used to find divergence and confirmed on indicator

is that correct?

thanks

--- 帖子 #786 ---
I would rather say in regular div. there must be a trend, for example in a down trend when price makes higher lows RSI will usually point to the opposite direction of the trend. It also means price is decelerating. So we take a trade against the trend.

In hidden div we are trading into a trend at a pull back. during the pull back price will make higher lows and RSI will make higher highs.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Understood - very helpful.

thanks

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Do you always wait for a pin-bar or engulfing candle as your trigger or at a swing point or trend line would an other type of candle suffice.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
I personally prefer/use pin bars and bear/bull engulfing only

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Took NU long trade at .7902 and GU long trade at .6140.. Sl around 30pips will take half at + 30pips or so.. How about you guys, anyone took the trade?

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I din take it because it wasn't a pin bar. it close in the middle of the bar....

--- 帖子 #792 ---
My trigger is always a pin or engulfing. I would prefer to trade at a trend line or swing point as I said.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
hi,

candle yet not closed,after closing candle taking trade is better.today gu has dropped around this time it swing in down direction,i will go up in ny session.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
I see.. Kinda doji there.. Aww crap took a gamble again.. Anyway sl is in place, what's done is done.. Need to wait for a strong reversal candle after this.

Edit: NU is making a bullish pinbar on H4 on my broker (cant post ss for now sorry, will follow up on this later). Might re-enter for the divergence on H4 only if it plays out.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Always wait for the candle to close for confirmation

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Just asking, is it ok if let's say there is a bullish pinbar (closed), and I take a trade at the break of that pinbar's high?

--- 帖子 #797 ---
yes my feeling is that is what you should do - look for break of pin bar plus 1-2 pips

--- 帖子 #798 ---
This has taken off on this occasion and got a quick win of 20 pips - now dropped

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Okay thanks for the help.. Appreciate it..

Cheers

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Closed all trades. Red pips today for me. Cheers

--- 帖子 #801 ---
potential short entry here at parity (1.0000) on this pair, as it is showing divergence on H1 at a very big numbr 1.0000 ... there seems to be some resistance here, and at 1.0030-1.0050 area  if 1.0000 gets taken out.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Cant see divergence on 1 hr chart with pin-bar or engulfing candle.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Think still waiting to see if we get confirmation. I have taken a screenshot of the current setup where I think divergence is - now waiting to see if current candle will form pin. My feeling is that if we do get a short, it is pullback before continuation of strong trend up (ie.. counter-trend trade)

ps: please ignore 50SMA - forgot to remove it before posting image

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Tha candle formation has not happened yet.  I was just alerting to a possible potential setup at this level.   Yes, we stil need to get the bearish candle formation before entering.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Thanks for posting.  This is correct

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Hey there PurePrice, nice spot on the USDCAD. the divergence occured at a very nice spot if viewed from the daily chart! I let it pass as well, the trigger wasn't there..

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Guys,

My first post and my first trade on this method but on H4 on UJ.. I am expecting a triangle breakout on the upside will move to BE on +20 and will ride till +50..

Please comment...

Moreover, if you guys see there is a divergence on the daily even.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
I was watching the very same. However I was a little confused on where to put entry and SL could you say what your thoughts are on this.  Are you waiting for a breakout of the trendline with a lttle retracement then confirmation.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Honestly, this is a comeback trade for me after 3 months. I was looking for a good system and liked this one. So I am taking this more for the heck of it.

Anyhow, just to answer your question: I am playing 2x on this one. My entry is at 79.80, target 80.30, SL 8 pips below the lowest low which is at 79.63 for me.. ie SL = 79.55. Other than that I will move to BE if it touches 80.

Honestly, there are better ways to get into this trade like when the price closes above 80, since that  is a psychological level, near last high, holds 55EMA Weekly and Weekly Pivot. So there is a lot of wood at that level. I took this trade for the heck of it and at present I am risking less than 0.1% on this trade... more like a comeback. So do plan as you seem fit.

All the Best

OFD

Although your trades are wins you don't seem to be entering from H1 pin bars or engulfing. Mind if you explain your rules?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hy Binyamin,

I am using a little bit different money management rules and I am more agrressive

Sometimes looking  lower tf to confirm my entries

As this is PA trading, watching few confirmations and my whole knowledge about forex, but first tool is rsi divergence.

i will not enter if divergence is not here

i hope that help a little

regards

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Though you are did not share your entry method in this post. I kind of get what you mean.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Am not sure I do..

Whilst I do not want to stray from the core strategy/rules of this thread, I am intrigued as to what the entry method is that you are using.

For divergence to occur then surely there must be two points on price and two points on the indicator (RSI) between which we observe the divergence. We can use the candles ie.. pin or engulfing to effectively indicate the point at which the second price anchor/point of the divergence is defined.

Any further info would be of interest. As I said, really not looking to stray from core methodology on this thread..

well done on your trades today :-)

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Well I don't think he is interested in sharing more than he said. But he did hint that he use lower timframes. And I can see how it can work out.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
yesterday i posted trades so you can look my criteria of entering trades. this is easy and good method just to follow pureprice rules in long run, but if you look on other tf and using good s i r lvls,draw trendlines etc. to see whole picture results will be even better

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Thanks for sharing. In my opinion I think your GU trade today wasn't a valid divergence.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
yesterday you mentioned you only looked at 1h timeframe.

Also you mentioned money management rules that were important but that you could not share

I know that you are only trying to help and it is much appreciated but it is confusing the hell out of me at the moment.

Would you be able to share a detailed break-down of one of the trades from above ie.. how you entered and managed the trade?

I know you use pureprice 1h in the strategy but further info would be great

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Why be so secretive when others are so open to help others master this method.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
hy bluemosaic,

it is hard to me tell you exact entry from my point of view.As i said i use great mm so i can let myself to be more aggresive.i cover my losses with it and have free stress trading.

Watch lower timeframes that will help you alot as Binyamin said

sorry if my english not best

regards

--- 帖子 #823 ---
It was valid divergence

--- 帖子 #824 ---
you are right bluemosaic that I said yesterday about watching only 1h tf.,but today was looking on smaller tf too.Trading for me is not just have hardcore rules,you have to look outside picture and accommodate to market.sorry for confusing you

--- 帖子 #825 ---
because i working with some guys who told me about this and i promise them not to tell,it is our bussiness secret sorry

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Zokynho I  was not referring to your mm if its a secret I understand.

It was about your method and how low a time frame do you look at was the answer I was hoping to get 30 min 15min or lower.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
This great post can help you http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...17#post5280317

--- 帖子 #828 ---
for example look this today trade on eur usd 1st picture is on 1h and we see that divergence forming but we don't know where to enter

on 2nd chart 5min we also see divergence and that was good confirmation for me to enter

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Thanks Zokynho

Info/link much appreciated. The post above explaining finer entry on 5min chart makes things much clearer.

Please keep posting your trades so that we can all learn and improve together and thanks all for making this a great thread. Am loving this approach to trading - pureprice has done a great job with this thread.

I am really busy this days with trading and do some things privately so maybe cannot post trades in real time and cannot answear right away but will be here to learn with you guys.i tried many strategy on ff factory,many fancy indies but from what i learned PA is most important thing indies are only tools to help you with decision.you have to learn watch price have feeling of it and have KISS principle.

Zokynho thanks for sharing your info.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
........ok  you clearly do not understand why divergence happens.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
I entered USDCAD when there was no divergence. In this case it was not easy to tell if there is a divergence if you don't look carefully.

Anyway the market went with my trade and I exit half at my 1st TP. Second is running.(That is 0.5% in my demo account, 2% so far. This trade doesn't count though its a bad one)

PS: If you were wondering why I don't draw my TL from the wicks, I have already explain it.

Update: SL at break even hit for my 2nd trade. There was a divergence in AU at the same time, I didn't take it because the bearish trend is string.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Can you clarify this please?

--- 帖子 #835 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...02#post5647302

For divergence to be valid there must be atrend followed by deceleration of price speed.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
What would be the stochastic setting for this method.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
USDJPY H1 there is a divergence happening at a previous price swing point. However the The daily show a very strong bearish trend. and a bearish flag.

Set my buy order above the pin.

Update: Stopped for -1% on my demo.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hi all,

I did this little pic to help clarify divergences. Basically divergence is when price is telling a different story to the indicator. So there are a few different types of divergence. Some of us are only seeing regular and some also hidden, until recently I didn't know what continuing was but have done some study and this is what I have learned.

Regular divergence happens at the END of a trend. So it is counter trend trade and can go against you for a while. It (RSI) and other indicators are basically telling us money is not coming in as strongly as it was. Indicator is diverging from price. This usually happens at resistance/support, round numbers, pivots, when news is imminent etc. Its saying people are taking profit here, exiting the market, taking the opposite trade etc. So it is basically predictive of what the big boys are/may be doing. Of course it can go against us and take sl but it seems to me the RSI is giving us an indication of what may happen. Trend is slowing and may reverse in the near future. This is why PP says need candle pattern and resistance/support as extra confirmation. Add divergence to candle pattern and support/resistance and it a safer trade.

Hidden divergence is when there was a trend and a retrace, the retrace does not go as high as previous highs, but the indicator shows a new high  so this is telling us something is not right, the divergence is indication the current retrace may come to an end and the original/overall trend may resume. In my chart example hidden divergence was followed by regular divergence.

Continuing divergence, the guy i learnt it from says, can only be seen on MACD, (his opinion I don't know any different). He explains that price continues to move up but the MACD continues to slope down. It has to have some peaks and valleys and the peaks get smaller, also the histogram stays on the same side. Personally this kind of divergence is annoying as sl will be taken out until it finally makes its move down.

Hope I haven't confused people more but if you look at the chart i have marked some of the divergences, it is a 15m chart but has examples of these 3 divergence types. Colour coded for ease of recognition.

Also there is a lot of "debate" about using wicks or close, I understand the principal of using close but I find the wicks easier to draw and see and trade. If the divergence is not clear and I am unsure I may draw the close to check but most often the divergence is there with either close or wicks, it just changes the angle. Personal preference seems the way to go with this.

Hope this helps to understand the different divergences.

Regards,

Julie

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Why is your rsi setting at 6 and not seven.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
No reason really. Thanks Julie for that post. Continuing div is something new to me.

Anyway we may get something in USDCAD again.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
excellent summary julie. thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #842 ---
At times although not all the time 1pt in the rsi makes a difference to either being or not being divergence.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
hi traders,

looks like a divergence trade may setup in usdchf. Did not setup yet, but i think it is worth keeping track of it. This may also fill the gap. We will see.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
If people are having problem finding and drawing the divergence to the close of the candle it may help to add a MA1 apply to close and connect the lines to the peaks of the MA.

Anyway this is not how this system is traded. PurePrice use the highs and lows of the candles.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Julie, Could you tell me what type of MACD indi did you used in your last post ? Is it a standard MT4 indicator? I have identical parameters (12,26,9), but my MACD histogram looks completely different (maybe it's due to time zone of my broker)

--- 帖子 #846 ---
What is the definition of an engulfing candle.

Do we just take in body of the previous candle or do we take in the wicks as well.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
nothing developed yet, but keep an eye on those yen pairs for a setup later on.  Seems like the yen is very strong against everythign else, but maybe we will a chance to trade it if it slows down a bit.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Only the body of the previous candle needs to be engulfed by the following candle

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Hi Whydak,

sorry about that I used the MACD the guy i am learning from provided. I personally don't use MACD as I don't find it easy to pick div, the peaks in RSI stand out more to me. I was just trying to show there are multiple versions of divergence.

Anyway i did a little research on this isssue and came up with this thread

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=69409

which the techies discuss the various pros and cons of MT4 macd and an indicator called MACD True, and there is a version with an alert, Macd ColorHist. It is very similar to the indi I got from my commercial forex guy.

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...8&d=1202622135

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...02008%203:05am

quote from the thread from a guy that seems to know he is talking about:

"Keep in mind, the blue MA line on the true MACD is exactly the same as the green histogram  on the default MACD.  When the red & blue MAs cross on the true  MACD, it's equivalent to the red MA line crossing the green histogram on  the default MACD.  There is no lag time with respect to crosses between  both indicators, they are identically timed.

This difference comes into play when you compare just histograms - one  represents an MA line (incorrect), whereas the other correctly  represents the difference between MA lines.   This is especially  important if one trades MACD histogram divergences (high probability  setups)."

I wasn't intending to pollute this thread with MACD stuff so if you want to know more about macd divergence trading please do your own searches. PP uses RSI and I can see why.

Regards,

Julie

Hi, Have just finished reading your great thread. I currently have 8 trades on the go all taken useing your Div with RSI and MACD.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
at the falling trendline now and making a lower high, while RSI is making a higher high, thereby creating hidden divergence (for now).   This is an area to watch for a "potential" short setup maybe

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Hi,

Thank you for this thread and everyone actively contributing.

PP, I want to ask you whether you consider context of other time-frames, whether Lower to find finer entry off H1 charts or higher tf to validate entry on H1.

For instance I see that Cable on H4 has bullish divergence, although not sure what its upside potential is. Nevertheless, worth noting when taking a short entry into consideration?

Thank you, livindaylite

Hi to all I am still in my AUDUSD trade from lastnight Aus employment figers just come out trade has go from just in profit to locked in 21pips profit

Tightend my stop on this trade. Just got taken out on frist profit stop for a gain of 57 pips. Still have 20% of position running stop is at pllus 30 pips approx 22 pips behind current price.

All my other trades from last night are sitting at BE plus spread except AUDJPY stoped out on a trailing stop for +3 pips and EURUSD stopped out for -15 pips.

So at the moment I'm positive 45 pips and counting

Hello.Does anyone here use or tried Vladimir Ribakov's LST Divergence system?It is a divergence system that gives alerts when there is divergence and a pin bar,hammer e.t.c have formed.Plus details Money Management....Thank you

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Hy smpprj,

where we can find this system?

regards

--- 帖子 #863 ---
I have that system I think that it is a good starting point. His vidos are very good.

I took two quick scalps one off a 37.5 retrace from the AUDUSD candle that formed from todays unemployment news am at +23 pips at the moment.

The other on a 37.5 retrace on USDCAD it is +13 pips at the moment .

I think that maybe the AUDUSD will turn the corner it has made a higher higher and higher low could be indication that it is starting ti head back up.

Bearish engulfing now formed

also (just as an observation) the three candles make 'abandoned baby' pattern - which is a reliable bearish pattern (apparently :-))

--- 帖子 #870 ---
i would be very careful, 4h has bullish regular divergence and pinbar so could be a battle of the bulls and bears.

personally i don't take trade like that 1 hour bearish hidden divergence as thy don't seem to go as far, i think its useful to exit a trade when it appears so if we were in long and bearish hidden appears it might be a good time to take profit.

Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
That is useful thanks.

So you normally just take regular divergence on 1h, 4h (and shorter?) timeframes ?

--- 帖子 #872 ---
i mostly look at 1h and 15 min, occasionally even 5 min, i am still adjusting to longer timeframes (1 hour is long for me) still experimenting and trying to find my niche.

But whatever time frame i see a trade i always check 1 lower and 1 higher to make sure there is not opposite signals. if signals are same eg bullish regular possibly forming on 1 hour and has formed on 15 min i jump in and don't wait for 1 hour confirmation, but i watch the trade and exit sooner if 1 hour does not confirm.

I am trying to train myself to hold for longer times. but once a 5 min trader always a 5 min trader it seems. Finding it a challenge to watch profit taken back in retraces.  I have held a few trades overnight recently, but i dont go to bed til after 2 am cos i want to watch and makes sure its "OK" lol so it really isn't my style. and to be able to sleep i had to only use micro lots, and then you get lots of pips and not much money, its hard to find a happy medium.

so i got 80 pips on my overnight euro trade - 8 bucks yippee, gonna get rich real kwik when it takes all night to make 8 bucks lol. i also held a aususd overnight - not great for micro lots as swap took a buck lol.

all a learning process, seems in forex the more you know, the more you you need to know more.

I know exactly what you mean. Am trying to focus on 1hour charts too - I still peak at 15min charts. I did start on daily and 4h timeframes but found the stop loss pips and retracements just too much to deal with.

I also like being in and out of a trade in a day - preferring to close all trades before sleeping. Found myself worrying overnight otherwise!

I really like this thread, the system and the contributors

Just hit target for +35 pips gain

big sigh of relief...

--- 帖子 #875 ---
hello all.

i identified a nice divergence on cableH1.iam not able to call it hidden divergence because cable is in downtrend and HD is continuation divergence.in any way great profit on  the chart.

easy pips for all

--- 帖子 #876 ---
The thing is with the longer time frames if you use proper

MM it's not realy much of a problem having bigger stops.

You just adjust your lot size so your percent stays the same.

You get less setups but the ones you get are better and give higher profit

Just have to get used to sitting on the side lines for longer.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
it "appears" for now that the majors are breaking out of the dominnat downtrend channel that has taken place for the past couple days.  GU with the BOE decision has now closed above the falling channel and above the previous support level of 1.6150.  Not sure if there will be contiuation of price in the long direction, but maybe worth keeping an eye on this one

Hi,

I'm trying to narrow in on just one or two trading methods that perform reasonable consistent across pairs.

Currently I trade engulfing and pin bar candles off bollinger upper/lower bands when stoch is overbought/oversold (only daily charts).  I'm averaging 64% wins, but the reward to risk ratio is low at 1.14 to 1.

Could someone share with me the win% and reward to risk ratio that you are experiencing using the 1HR method in this thread?

Thanks,

John

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Well done on this one it is the first time I have heard of this pattern I will need to keep my eyes open in the future for this pattern.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
many thanks

I did enter on the bearish engulfing (in keeping with this thread) but noticed the abandoned baby pattern had also formed which I took as a sign that price was more likely to head down

--- 帖子 #881 ---
hello here are my results for today

EUR/USD +20

USD/CHF +10

AUD/USD +15

Overall score: +45 pips

I wasn't with my chart whole day so missed some setups NZD/USD,USD/JPY, EUR/JPY

here are pictures and explanations

1.AUD/USD entry was taken after divergence on 5 min chart (i found them great and reliable for entry)

2.USD/CHF this divergences on 1h chart was little hard to spot,so i draw divergences on line chart (it is very helpful sometimes).Confirmation and entry was on 5 min chart.little late entry but ok didn't spot earlier

3.EUR/USD there was bounce from 1h strong support and offcourse confirmn with 5 min divergence.also little late entry

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Tip:

1.Look at triple divergence, there are almost sure trades (AAA+++ trades)

2.They happens rarely but with rsi they are really reliable

3.you can take more profit from them (general trends is changing probably)

4.i reccomend you too enter on 5 min chart but have sl on 1h tf so you have room if price tends to work 3rd divergence on 5 min+it is earlier entry and you can have more pips

SORRY PUREPRICE I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT PART OF YOUR ENTRIES SO IF YOU WANT ME TO STOP POST I WILL DO THAT

higest regards

Hi Zokynho I think you are a bit of a genius for this type of trading I can not think anyone could take offence to your input as it can only make us better traders.

Hi Ladies and Gents,

Whooping by to say hello to ya alll!

I recently joined fxfactory and what a lovely forum thread I found hehe. Looking forward reading your experiences and trades, there is always something to learn. I've been trading oscillator divergences@convergence levels mostly on higher time frames 4h/daily.

Here is a trade i took yday morning.

http://imageshack.us/f/210/audusd15.png/http://imageshack.us/f/210/audusd15.png/

Have a great one!

--- 帖子 #886 ---
I've been up 2.5% from yesterday with 2 trades still running.

I entered AUDJPY, USDCAD and AUDUSD

1.5% + 0.5% +0.5%

The trades are purely H1. No other tricks. I am testing out H1 1st, will add some tricks if I have time in the future to trade them.

So far I find pure H1 divergence having good edge. But as the others say, its good to look especially in the higher timeframe to avoid taking a trade when it is not right to take. I don't know if it can work long term, but will find out.

The pinbar and engulfing pattern I have been trading is according to james16 definition. FYI

--- 帖子 #887 ---
thank you for your kind words Don

--- 帖子 #888 ---
hello Binyamin,

I am interested in your tricks so would be good if you will have time to post them

thank you in advance

regards

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Hi there, wait till I get back to post the charts. There are not really tricks. I was a scalper in the M5 until time don't permit. In the choros thread. So I might try to implement it with this method.

The other one is I trade NNbob method. Just from a glance I find that this method works well with his method when the market is ranging with a up wards or downwards bias. So my feeling is, this method is good for trading when the higher timeframe shows a clear trend. Trade the pull backs. Exactly like my AU, USDCAD and AJ trade yesterday.

But of course it is beyond the original method. Right now all I am interested in is. Given just H1 and nothing else, what is the edge like.

Anyway all 3 trades hit my 2nd take profit with a 4.5% increase in my demo. To date the demo is 2.5% in the positive.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Hi today while I was dot looking at my charts T missed a good divergence on AUDUSD. So instead I took these trades useing trend lin breakout, I find it is always good to heve a backup plan that way hopefully wont miss out to often.

So far am up 55 pips AUDUSD

72 pips AUDJPY

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Hi Is anyone watching the EURJPY looks to me like it is starting to set up a divergence on it>

--- 帖子 #892 ---
well basics do work in the long run I'm witness to that. I do have a look for divergences on H4 before I trade on H1 makes me feel more comfortable. Great to know about the profits happy pipping

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Did you take it fx?

--- 帖子 #894 ---
I have a sell stop waiting to get triggerd  stoploss at 25pips, Also a sell stop on USDCAD

and am short on GBPUSD 25pip stop frist profit level at 31 pips.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Are these on 1h timeframe? I am not seeing these setups.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Yes all on one hour chart. I will take screen shots and post.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Here are the shots of my charts. The EURJPY has just triggerd.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
thanks for posting - appreciate it

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Has anyone got any trades going????

--- 帖子 #900 ---
It appears to me that the USDCAD is once again stuck at long term ressistance it has reached this level several times over the pas months.

Their also appears to be divergence forming. I think that if the price falls from here it will drrop like a LEAD ballon the trigger I think will be todays news release. Time to get ready for a hopefully profitable ride.  But then whet do I Know I'm just an old dog learning new ticks.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Correct me if I am wrong, but isnt EUR/JPY forming hidden bearish divergence on M30 with bearish engulfing candle around strong resistance area right at the moment + bearish MACD divergence (21,34,8) on M5? (I am new to the divergence world so excuse me if I got it all wrong)

--- 帖子 #902 ---
5 min to go then we know what will happen to CAD will it be up or down place your betts

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Just locked in 13 pips on the CAD news release

and took out frist TP @+30

Have closed all my trades for this week as I have to be at work in another 6 hours need my sleep.

This week has been pretty good am up 12.2%, 231 pips for ta

he week. Today made 258 pips or added 4.9% to this account.

Ithink I like  useing Divergence on the one hour time frame.

Everyone have a profitable day.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
ok here are my trades for today

EUR/JPY +24

EUR/USD +15

NZD/USD +29

USD/CAD +30

USD/JPY +12

overall result: +110 pips

usd/chf is still running (short)

gbp/usd is in recovery

aud/usd recovers

I reccommend you to watch divergences on line chart sometimes it easier to spot them

--- 帖子 #906 ---
....and the last one....

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Next week i will try do some improvements on my exit positions.You can see that my entries are goog but I cut my winners to early sometimes.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
For exits i am trying this method. I have a script that I can set risk % then place lines across my chart named SL,PE (pending entry) TP1,TP2,TP3 (set exit percent of position for each TP level)

Example if you wish to exit 60% at TP1, 20% TP2 20% TP3 the script will adjust each order to the correct lot size so that the whole order is not greater than the set risk percent or total risk lots that you set.

I am trying to set my trades so that the frist TP is 80% of total and the R/R is 1 to 2 and let the remaining 20% go with a trailing stop. For thisto work I have to set the frist profit level at approx 2.4 times the stoploss this will still return twice the risk even if the remaining 20% of your trade is stoped out at break even. You still can get away with a strick rate of around anly 40% winning trades and still be in profit. It is all about how much you risk with each trade in the frist place I usually risk no mora than 1% per trade and try noy to have more than total of 6% total risk at any one time.

This I learned the hard way only after blowing a 14K account becaus I thought I new better

If you can stick to this or something simller it may not appear as though your doing much but you eill make good profit and at the same time be saveing your account through the times when you have drawdowns

--- 帖子 #909 ---
hy fx probe thank you for your help I appreciate it but I am using different type of mm so this method would't be much of help for me but if it profitable for you great

Hey Guys,

i'm new to this method and I was wondering if there are enough trading opportunities every day from opening until closing of new york to make at least 30 pips/day. I back from school at 13:00 (1 hour before the opening of NY) so I can trade only in those hours.

Thanks,

Luca

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Definitely - obviosuly not guaranteed as markets are not guaranteed but just look through some of the posts (even recently the trades from Zokynho, Fxprobe etc._ and you will good wins each day.

I have been trading this method for a month and win rate of 75% (including several mistakes which would have improved rate more..)

--- 帖子 #916 ---
I've seen lot of pips made during this month from all traders, but i can trade just NYO till the end of NY.. That's why i was asking that question.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #917 ---
No idea about just NY but don't see why not.

I trade London open (8am) to around 7-8pm (mid US)

--- 帖子 #918 ---
PurePrice the owner of this thread is only trading ny session so there is some good opportunities every day.we trade this strategy on majors so you can see trade every day at least on 1 pair

I currently have three open trades on the go EURUSD +36 pips AUDUSD sitting +11 pips and USDCAD -12 pips .

So far today am negitive 24 pips but am working on getting them back into my account.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Just exited AUDUSD teade small 3 pip profit am expecting USDCAD to move down away from ressistance level once again.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
hi,

could you post a screenshot of your audusd trade?

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Sorry didn't tske one the trade was only to fill in time while I was waiting when I noticed that USDCAD was getting stuck at ressistance I thought it was time to exit the AUS trade and short the CAD as I have noticed these two seem to to have negitive corralation. Will post soht of CAD.

Here is the shot of my CAD trade with some explanation as to why I took this trade and where my frist profit level is.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
That's pretty much when I trade. I would just caution you to let the market come to you and don't get impatient. There are some days when there are no attractive trades, so you will just need to sit on the sidelines. Staying out of bad trades is a great move when the setups are less than ideal. Better to risk a higher % of your account per trade on great setups than take everything that smells like a trade. Like all others, this system requires some discretion.

Scott

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Thanks for this - no divergence in this trade though - correct?

--- 帖子 #927 ---
If you switch to a line chart you will see a good divergence just before the trend line break on RSI.

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Should have kept my AUDUSD short open it has now moved 20 pips in that direction .

Never mind another one will come along soon.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
I'm seeing a divergence on AUD/USD 1HR. A good entry would be this pinbar, right?

--- 帖子 #930 ---
usd -cad h1 seems hidden divergence.

aussie regular div but no trend change for now

What's going on with the GBPUSD anyone go any ideas??

happy trading all!

Can you please post chart showing divergence on this?

nice trade

--- 帖子 #935 ---
have definitely found today slow going - saying that, better to stay out of trades than to take bad ones.  Survive for another day

Well done to all who took pips today

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Have a look @ a 1h chart it's plain as day!

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #937 ---
I am really missing this one - please see image below

thanks

--- 帖子 #938 ---
I'm not sure coz i'm new to this method but i think this is the divergence.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Yes I think that is divergence.

However that is not the point that icarusFx took the short trade and I am having trouble seeing divergence at that point marked with down arrow

Thanks

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Yeah that's it! Now go to the 15min and there is another div that I entered off! Sorry I'm on my iPhone I dont work during family time. Hope this helps! Ps The thing I liked the best was the entry position being right at daily pivot and a great resistance area!

--- 帖子 #941 ---
I see it on the 15min chart

Thanks

--- 帖子 #942 ---
There are two short divergence setups in that image but i don't think any of them follows the rules by PurePrice. The first setup is a hidden divergence and i don't think PurePrice have any rule for that one.

The next is a regular divergence but do not follow the rules by PurePrice because it is below 70 on RSI.

Arctic4x

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Yeah that was my thoughts exactly - they don't follow pureprice rules.

If you switch to 15min chart then you see it.

Still the trade is not following this thread rules/method which is why I was keen to clarify - in case I was missing something . Good trade by icarusfx though .

Thanks all

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Sorry people I should've clarified my trade to avoid confusion. I don't trade according to pureprices method but it's similar, which is why i'm posting. I've been in contact with purprice who is happy to see another divergence based perspective. I can't post a great deal but with any luck I can help a couple of you guys find your feet.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Fully understand - and thanks for posting.

Your help is much appreciated so please do continue to post setups, advice, guidance etc.

yup i just took this trade.Confirmations for me is 5 min divergence also.

watch for a bounce off the daily pivot 102.60 area

--- 帖子 #952 ---
How's your trade going I didn't take it as I belive that the price will move back up. I think that by looking at M5 charts you are getting to far away from what happeens on 1 hour and that is the chart that I trade from H4 chart is more relevent to what we are looking for. Just my thoughts.

I close eur/ jpy at +8 pips at DP

--- 帖子 #961 ---
It has dropped quite a few pips - approx 45-50 now

Still - you had positive pip win!

--- 帖子 #962 ---
closed 1/2 position for +29 sl moved to +10 then closed at +35

thats me for the day

--- 帖子 #963 ---
ok this is something that I wanna talk about and hear you opinions.

When i was entering in this trade i was full of confidence that will go down.my analyzes showing me that but i started doubt when icurusfx told me that there is dp.

Before, in all my strategies (i tried many strategies believe me) there was pivots but they are always confusing me because my opinion that they are not true and reliable in market.

I mean every trader has different point of view.I talked to good traders about pivots and everyone have different number because of broker,sunday opening wrong calculation etc etc so i stop using them.Always doubt about enter not enter in trade when i see them on chart especially DP.

This was happened to me again today, i took +8 pips but could take much more if I let this trade.

When you backtest lots of strategies you see how they profitable are but you don't see pivots in past so why use then in prezent then.

Forex is not so hard,mental approach of every trader is doubtfull and could be hard.

You never know if buy or sell buy or sell but if you use only prezent and watch only today's patterns support resistance areas and psychological aspects + some of fundamentals news you never again doubt it was good or bad trade so kiss principles are the best principles and you don't need anything else, only price and divergence in this case (which is very powerfull)

how many times did we see that there is Daily pivot and we doubt enter or not and price breaks that lvl like knife in butter?

I just wanted to say that keep your charts clean and trust yourself you trade for your own money,leave to many indies and learn about price movements.

I would like to disscuss about these so feel free to comment?

sorry for my bad english

higest regards

Regular bullish divergence potentially setting up on EUR/USD and EUR/JPY.

Waiting until current candle close for confirmation

--- 帖子 #965 ---
I fully agree with you - I do not bother with pivot points as I find them very confusing. Price does sometimes react to them but often it won't (in my limited experience).

I currently have a 50EMA on my chart (considering removing but price often reacts off this on 1H) and the RSI. That is all. I think the simpler the better as it avoids contradictary thoughts and signals.

Just need to have the mental strength and confidence to analyse the trade (you are doing well here), put the trade on and leave it alone (with SP and TP ascertained).  Easier said than done I know...

Forex and indeed any trading is about mental strength

--- 帖子 #966 ---
You do make a great point. But I would say this is something to do with our individual personalities. I have traded different markets on and off for the past 12 years forex for 4, but still I don't consider myself successful. Probably one of the biggest reason is that I want to learn everything there is to and I want to see what everyone in the world is seeing. I think this is my biggest flaw.

Rather than looking at what the big boys look at i.e. Price... I look at a lot of other things like Pivots, Moving Averages, S&R at all time frames and in the end I am confused. For every trade that I wish to take I can see so many obstacles towards my initial target. Hence, my confidence drops and later on I realize that wow that was a catch and I let it run because of my so called over-reliance. As mentioned I don't use any other indicator other than the RSI but even certain price based metrics are confusing enough.

So, yes I totally agree with you that if it worked for us in Demo, why make it more confusing why not keep it simple. But, it is a huge part of our personality and how we look at things... and that is what differentiates a great trader from an average trader and that is why having a system and keep on developing it is even more important.

Well said.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
I think it also comes down to us always looking for the 'holy grail' - something which returns a 95%+ win rate - which is completely unrealistic and unneccessary given good money management.

Be happy focussing on one simple system eg. this thread - divergence of price and RSI -and trading it consistently and with good money management and you will be profitable.

--- 帖子 #968 ---
i never before have that mental strenght till now but only because one thing and that is money management (which is I think most important thing to strenght your mind)

i can let myself mystakes trade either conservative and aggresive depends on market on that period (day week month)

think about mm more I gave you some tips with triple divergences, do analyze and watch lower tf for confirmations because most of traders looks on higher tf what will happen on lower tf next and this is wrong

Lower times frames comes first and they showing what will happen in longer time frames

regards

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Hi zokynho, sorry if I put you off....

Pivots are not the be all or end all of trading by any means but I use them in my frankensteinian methods lol I give them more credence when they line up with other things such as range extremes and other sup/res (fib pivots often do this).

appologies again I'll keep my trap shut next time....

btw your trading seems to be working just fine for you! & thats the important part after all.

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Hi Icarus

Please don't stop with suggestions/tips etc.. - the good intention is there. People can either take the ideas on board or ignore. I like to keep things really simple but everyone is different.

This is a great thread - full of very helpful people and a good technique.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #971 ---
It is tough when you see people posting different thoughts, but it's all about mind set!  I firmly believe the more perspectives a trader can comprehend the better. scalper/swing/fib etc etc buy or sell that is what gives an edge imho.

nice thread & people

--- 帖子 #972 ---
No icarusfx, you didn't put me off like bluemosaic said you have good intensions.

please share your thought and knowledge we can learn from each other.

I put myself off it is that hard mental part.

My advise was only for neewbies who maybe have my personality but still didn't find right way and like to many off this fancy indies.

please share your trading skills in future

Sorry my English isn't so good, I meant, the divergence that pure price saw (I didn't spot it) was probably a hidden one because in the usdcad and EURGBP they were not yet in the over bought or sold zone. Sorry for my spelling and my incongruity :s

Is anyone looking at the EU Div on the 1H... although the trend is down.. but still is anyone considering playing this one on the next candlestick signal ?

I am looking at it. There is also regular div forming on EURJPY and EURGBP but it is against the trend so I do not think Ill jump on it.

Morning peetp & onefineday

did you take the trades? not one for me really i'd like something more to trade off like 2624 low in jan :oD should get a nice bounce off that.

have a look @ usd/chf

kind regards

--- 帖子 #981 ---
sorry peetp missed this post... think it's been covered now:o)

Regular divergence is always against the trend of the timeframe you're looking at.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
@icarusFx

I did take the EU at 12714.1,  got stopped out in profit at 12722.1 (+8pip) Now that I look at it I should have taken profit when RSI 70 was hit on M15 (close to 21EMA on 1H at 12740).

@ohammond

Correct. I got confused but researched it through now.

I got out of USD/JPY at +11 and EUR/USD at +8. Not too happy about EUR/USD but we learn all the time dont we?

Lets hope tomorrow will be as fruitful in great setups as today was.

Good luck everyone!

Sorry I'm new here and I'm seeing a regular bullish divergence on GBPJPY H1 am I right?

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Potentially yes, but u need to wait for the candle to close.  We might get a double bottom here, and if we have a pinbar it would be nice.  Otherwise, we may have to wait for bullish englufing candle, but it is really late in NY and market may not move well until Asian open maybe.  However, we just have FOMC minutes and that maybe enough to move the market

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
I wasn't sure, but now it's clear, I have to wait the close of the candle (confirmation of the divergence) then the hammer or Bullish engulfish. Thank you !

one to watch...

Yeah it looks even more promising now.

Zokynho, I am impressed from your trading of this strategy. Do you only post your winning trades or you simply do not have any loosers. I would like to see a chart with a loosing trade too.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Hi,

Pureprice , Zokynho

Can you please tell me your exit strategy? i am always confuse about this.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
hy ttitto,

it is quite difficult for me to explain you  because i use different kind od money management.Mostly of my trades are winners but i have loosers (like every trader) which I recover so they are actually not loosers.so I can be more aggresive in this way of trading and don't have to worry about loosess.

Hintlease read posts of forexcube (he is maybe the best teacher about forex I known and alorente's recovery trades) this can be much of help to you and then you merge it with triple divergences and enter on smaller timeframes (great risk reward) you will also have free stress trading and winner.

If you watch my trades you see that i enter on 5 min so when everybody think should i enter or not on 1h i am with profit already and moving on

you can increase your knowledge about reading tasayc system of fxcube to get some ideas.he use divergence and post much examples + great teaching of mm.

i hope that help

regards

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Umpats,

I have problems too with my exits i was scalper before and didn't change that mentality (altought I am working on it) so often i cut my winners but sometimes i let it and then price go in wrong direction so again i took smaller profits.

Hardest (1 million) questions on forex is when to exit.sometimes I watching strong s i r levels sometimes divergence of 5 min,but sometimes my screen time and knowledge help me but as I said still didn't find best exit strategy for this.

Pure price is using 1:1 or 1:2 risk reward i think but he uses different kind of mm

Maybe PurePrice can teach us about when to exit better?

regards

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
I know that you trade with a special MM and I am not asking you to reveal the secret. But just posting the winners without losers is not correct and leave the impression in the other readers of the threat that this is the wholy grail. If you do not want to post charts at least please write with a text  how many pips and from which pair you lost.

Thank you for the teaching recommendations. I will take a look at them.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
HINT: Also I am using less hidden divergence than regular.It is called hidden because sometimes is hard to spot her so traders don't often see her.It means that trend will probably continue but you have to confirm those on other timeframes.I use her most of the times when after long strong trend price comes back little and then after forming probably will do double bottom .

I hope you understand my english isn't best

regards

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
hmmmm..just example last night i enter on cable and go sleep. My tp was at +30 pips,price come to +25 and go down again i didn't close position.it is still open (currently -7 pips) but in long run cable will go up so if comes agains me i will add to positions or do analyses again so it is stupid to post my bad trades it will only confuse people because i do not accept lossess and people might think that this is nothing to do with strategy.

i am only trying to teach newbies to open their eyes and don't have hardcore rules.we must be adjust to market so i am trying to learn them how they have to think

strategy like holy grail don't exist only traders and their emotions plans and discipline.

sorry if i maybe confusing you tell me and i'll stop posting

regards

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
...and please see some post of fxcube,he's explanations of mm and  english is much better so you will understand what I am talking about....

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
That means you are trading live without stop loss and average down if you have a bad position?

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I am still on demo with this trying to implement best money management for this but still practising till i find best solution...

regards

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
it is really hard to answear your questions,always different,how and what market tell me i try to see and adjust.

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
No worries, testing different approaches is never a bad idea. Although please do comment on what happened with those trades which turned into a loss. As someone already pointed out, not sharing what happens with losers will create a false illusion. Handling losers are just as important as handling winners !

I'm grateful for your posts, keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Thanks Ati

Anyone following this pair? There is a slight bullish divergence if you go by the low-prices but bears seem particularily strong in the downtrend.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Hi guys..

I've just came back from vacation, didn't trade for a while.. So how is the divergence trade doing for the past week or two, good? Saw usd was strengthening like hell lol..

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
here are some learning from fxcube about money management that can help you alot

LOM - 1 Step

Loss Order Management

Fragmentation

When you go in the market with 1 Lot so cut this 1 Lot into pieces, say 10 x 0.1 Lot Sizes.

When you trade normally 0.1 Lot so reduce to small pieces 10 x 0.01 Lot.

To do so has several benefits.

(A) You could go in with one (or several) 1/10 order(s) more and moreover when the price will turn in the counterpart direction.

(B) You could set your Stop Loss not so tight by giving the market its breath.

(C) The market signalizes different options of making a profit. Some Price Levels perform a higher probability. Not every market situation "promise" the same profit. So it's absolutely stupid to go in the market every time with the same Lot Sizes.

(D) When you don't have the time to monitor the market, you could set different input and output levels, dependent at which time frame you will go in and out of the market.

LOM - 2 Step

Loss Order Management

Right Calculation - Profit per Day

When I set the target of 1% Profit per Day, so I have to earn an infinite deal more, e.g. 1.5%, 2% or 3% every day.

These trades are balanced out the losses.if you have let's say 4% today you have room for losers. This could give an area of freedom. This psychological momentum could be advantageous to traders who don't like to be stressed when they trade the forex market.

95% of all these trades will turn in the winning zone sooner or later; - so why to kill it with the feeble-minded 2% rules before? There's no sense for me! When worse comes to worse you could hedge some of these ones. Think about it!

hi,

Anyone here who has long term success with this type of sytem?

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
this pair is having a tough time getting above 0.8000 as it has been trying three times now, and looking like it may have divergence and pinbar on this 7:00 EST candle (10 minutes to go still before candle closes).  It is worth watching this for a possible short setup.

eur/gbp closed the gap and stopped @ r3 possible short from here (i'm not trading it though as i'm goin home)

aud/jpy hit my tp1 quickly then the arse fell out of it..... thats why splitting a trade is good (for my head more than anything)... Nothing worse than watching good trades turn bad and getting nothing out of a once profitable position.

looking through the days charts I can't believe I didn't trade eur/cad

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
got stopped out on usd/cad. Played it with smaller size due to ct trade (+some pairs looked really ugly at the time so was afraid of tc of usd bull)

EUR/AUD shows hesitation on longer term picture also, been watching it for a week or so now. Might be worth to follow in the coming days

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
is it okay to buy aud/usd now ? im still new to this method , still learning, can someone help me point out the divergence , so that i know whether im right or not..

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
I saw this thread last night and went looking for signals. I found USDJPY had one, but I wasn't ready to trade using this technique, so I missed out on the thirty or so pips.

Now, however, I see EURUSD has a long signal showing up.

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Balls of steel required for this one. But it might just work since oil, gold and silver are up and the FTSE100 is full of mining companies etc

nothing else on atm

just looked at eurjpy and yeah there's div at a nice lvl but it's not a trade i'd take atm as it's not conforming to the setups I look for (yet)....This is not to say it won't be a great trade but rather one i've no history of trading. I'll watch it for sure!

What would be the plan for EJ ? Is at a convergence point as we speak

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Yeah.. I did take the trade early at .70.. Like I said earlier, the fitch downgrade thing totally ruined ej trade plan today.. But luckily didnt break 102.20 barrier (23.6 fibo area). Anyway still holding, if it breaks the 102.20 then the trade invalidates imo..

fingers crossed, liked the setup so entered around .94

thanks

closed 101.91 short @ 100.28 after breaking to new lows

put a wide stop on remaining position, will see if it continues to fall in days to come.

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
I suggest for finding divergence just go to previous 2 or 3 LL or HH.....

any other suggestion welcome.

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
better to look for trend continuation signals since we have a clear risk off trend in almost all asset classes. Counter-trend plays in yen pairs is very risky, better stick to majors instead of crosses. I cannot say, i simply do not like the looks of it (your screenshot) not because it didn't work. Maybe others will give more helpful advice  Don't worry, there is always a next trade that will work

update: look at other time frames (to get a feel of what's happening around you), look for points like E/SMAs, former break out levels, strong areas - fibo levels - support/resistance in form of tops/bottoms.  Try to find similar situations that worked out before.

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
Grats nice trade.. For me I closed all my ej shorts at 101.10.. Too early eh.. But yeah its been a long day for me..

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
grats for you too, you had more pressure on you holding out and turning into profit, hats off from me

thanks pureprice for heads up, i would have missed it otherwise

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
Hi,

You just bought in a massive downtrend - look at the bigger picture. Hidden divergence is a continuation "pattern", you find this confirming the current trend - which is very strong down. Not to mention the effect of the latest JPY news...

Another things, on the divergence you spotted: I think the RSI lows are way too far away, seems like 80 bars. I think the higher the distance the lower the reliability. Try not to go more than 20-30 bars away, maybe not even this far. And the rsi was too much on the other side of 50 line. And besides the difference between the rsi lows seems to be quite small. The higher the difference the higher the reliability.

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
Thanks all for the advice on my failed trade from earlier.

Really useful info

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Actually wht you did wrong was you didnt wait for the next candle stick to form before taking a trade and also you didnt check if other oscillators a pointing to boy signal.

In general it is better to take a trade in the direction of the longer time frame that gives you 90% winning trades.

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
nice!

I gave back way to many pips yesterday turning a +3-4% day into a 1. and didn't trade eur'jpy doh!

Always look at the bigger picture, euro is solid downtrend. Volatility is going to come in pretty much soon (or already there) so careful now

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
There are bullish divergence on H1 eu, ej and gj and imo its valid if the hourly close have some reversal confirmation.. But the usd is strengthening like hell for now, it might be kinda gamble to take.. Anyway I might take it, some say better to stick to our method whether in good times or bad times haha..

Regards

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
hey mad,

Yeah based on my feelings and short term signals I want to close rest of my EJ... loads of people shorted euro on break... so a push above break down would be PAINFUl, so might just happen lol. Will stick to my original plan, will try to add to position around 99.85/95 area and close everything above 100.20

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
If can I ask you, you still keeping ur ej shorts? Holy crap haha.. I do take eu and ej long just now but I didn't want to push it as it is in a strong downtrend.. 20-30 pips is good enough for a long euro trade imo..

Edit: usdx is also showing a regular divergence (I dont know if I'm looking at the right index, ticker usdollar) with a good red candle after that rally and it is around psych level..

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
yes closed half yesterday when hitting new lows around 100.28

meanwhile well it came back to my area, added to position.  usually i do not enter on stuff like this but wanna see how it goes

time for sleep, good luck mad

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Oh I see.. Good luck to you too ati..

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
I thinks its ok to take a short position on eur/jpy but keep stoploss tight cos there might be a retracement later today or tomorrow am waiting for the signal to enter long on eur/jpy with a take profit of just 40pips and exiting the trade if i get a reverse signal.

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
I would not touch a long euro position with an 8 foot pole right now just because it sems like every rally is being sold and the euro is in such a strong downtrend, it is pretty hard to hold a long position.  However, if you are the adventurous type and you can stomach the drawdown, go for it and you might catch the bottom and have a heck of a ride up again

I personally would look for short opportunities on Euro using Hidden bearish divergence setups.   There appears to be Hidden divergencec now on eurusd and somewhat a bearish candle.  Let's see if this plays out.

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
I have a sell trade now base on my trading triger, looking to take profit at 99.23 daily pivot support and a stop loss wen i get a reversal sign.

thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
Hi there,

Since you are a newbie as you claim, the best thing is for your to put in more studies and then make sure you have a demo account and trade what you see, or what you think it is. That is the only way you will learn and build confidence in your analaysis. You have to learn to do this yourself hence a demo account is good to start with. If you get it wrong then it was a demo trade anyway, you learn slowly and before you know it, you are a master chartist. so asking some one to tell you to take a sell trade or buy trade on a chart is just not the way, Demo trade it and figure it out. Also give it time, trading is a whole career on it's own and can not be rushed. Hope you take my point and go for it.

Just my two pips worth of advice.

Thanks

exhibiting regular divergence with hammer (pin) bar at previous support levels.   May be worth taking a look at those pairs for apossible long entry

potential short setup on regular divergence below 1.0250

Don't we wait the price enter in the overbought/oversold in regular divergence?

Yes, and we have that with AU .. very close in USDCAD (but this one is at very likely reversal level)

Hey guys him new here but can someone correct me if I'm wrong but is there divergence all over the place right now?

Thank

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
Hi there... well I'm currently holding the last part of my sell position. (15min trade)

You need to wait for the candle to close to confirm your entry! there is no entry (atm) and no reason to enter long where you entered. Just seeing divergence is not enough..... think of it as more of a heads up that something "may" happen.

have another readthrough for Price action confirmation etc

kind regards

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
thats very normal

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
next support for gbp/usd is 1.55000 you should look for something there  pa wise for a possible bounce but i'd not like to be long against the dollar at this point in time.... scalping is poss but I'm looking to enter with trend... hence the short on pullback.

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Thank for the advise, yes the entry that you see are not good, I need then see a close of a pin bar or Engulfish, but my point was, is there really divergence all over the place right now and if so there will be plenty of opportunity probably

Sorry, my english isn't that good

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
So you are just entering in hiding divergence? Because hide divergence is a trend continuation but all regular divergence are divergence of the actual trend.

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
your english is very good!

yes there is divergence all over the place.... it will always occour after a "trend pause push " combo as i call it. If the push is into good support or resistance that when I get interested.

hope this helps

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
no i'll enter on both but I need my entries @ sup & res and I also like to enter at range limits on various timeframes. I'll have an area in mind for action and if i get what i'm looking for i'll jump on in!

Sup Pure Price, I'm trying to master the strategy that you're explaining in your trend, so as a mater of fact I made a summarize of some definition of divergence strategy plus some of your own post in a document and I taught that it can be useful for other follower of the trend. You can modified it or correct it as you want (My English is not so good but I copied most of the text in the document)  Attached File(s)   Divergence and candle sticks.doc

commodities devastated , bond yields hitting all time lows, stocks falling, risk off all over the place. Entering long here is just too risky for me and can't see any setup really (dollar index is just uber strong All rallies were used to sell into so I stay away or enter short only until we got a clear change of trend. good luck if you try it though

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
Now I see RSI(7) divergences on: AUDJPY, CHFJPY, EURJPY, EURUSD, GBPAUD.

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
with the USD being so strong lately, it is a good idea to stay with the trend. For us to trade with the trend, we look for hidden divergence at reactionary levels, and also wait for candle formations to tell us that the price will "probably" continue following the trend. Now is the time to look for that setup as we have hidden divergence almost on every Major pair and we have some bearish engulfing candles already formed. Bring up your charts , draw your lines, and wait for the price action to tell you that the trade is on .. good luck

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
Hey guys did you already used the indicator "TMA Slope"? It's an indicator that calculates the slope of triangulated moving average to determine where the trend is too strong to go against it. I think it can be useful what do you think?

I looked at the tma system and ran it next to the way I trade as they are/were similar. tma is a moving average with aveage true range banding. it looks good on backtesting as it repaints! having said that the current bar is always correct. you need the tmatrue which doesn't repaint to get a handle on how you could trade it, it's on ff somewhere. It wasn't an improvement on my system but each to there own.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
Yes I did trade the extreme tma but what I wanted to brought is the tma slope can help to identify a strong trend that we don't want to trade against

Hello friends,

Try to contribute and share your thought and pics. , this is very nice threads...

dont let it die.

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
I dont think this thread is dead, but it has been slow. This just tells me that people do not have questionsany more and they undertand the method well. So, the job is done

IF you are looking for setups, check out GU H1 chart for a bullish divergence at significant level of 15580 (previous support and rising TL)

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
We might get a setup here if the H1 candle close in bullish englufing .. so far it is looking good, but there is still 25 minutes to go before this candle closes ... This is a critical level, so be cautious because if this breaks down to the low side, we may see a nice run down and GU tanking below the TL.

*sorry to smertius for using his pic without asking

hi, i have one question when div does not come down.

in this pic, i have marked 1 and 2 where i see as possible entrances.

for what i have tried, i have gone into great DD when i tried to re-enter using

martingale, doubling the lot

or

not using martingale, enter same lot size

failed both ways, even with small lots like 0.01

so is it better to setup a SL?

maybe do this in small TF?

this system looks like a champ for me, but i just need a good exit/SL? with me.

thanks to y'all

Good day all - really great to see increased activity. I work full time and want to quit my day job one day and make a living from trading.

I would really apprecate feeedback from the dedicated contributors to this thread. How much time do you put into trading and for those who are doing it full time, how much preparation did you do prior to being full time.

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
Hi there,

IF you just trade the higher TF like from 1D and above, you can still keep your day job and still do really well in trading. Also, some people may be full time traders but became one by accident. I do contract work so have learnt how to trade on the hourly TF when I am not working and have also learnt how to Trade the 1D TF when I am working. So there you have it.

You just have to want it badly make a change and start learning to analyse the 1D timeframe charts. Look left at support and rsistance - structure leaves clue all the time. Trade those resistance and support points and it helps if you know Fibbo retracement and extension tools. You will be amazed how they all fit in if you start studyung them. With 1D time frames, depending on how good and quick you are at market analysis, you can spend just about 15 minutes to 30 minutes a day on your chart mark support resistance levels, draw trend lines look for divergences and set your pending and stop loose orders and off you go till the end of the day. Look at your charts 12 hours later and leave the market to play out. Demo this strategy for a few months and you will learn alot before you go live. That is how I do it and one trade can run for  3 days to a week and you can come home with 100 to 400 pips. SL will normally be from 50 - 70 pips. Draw Trend lines and most of all PLAN YOUR TRADES AND STICK TO A PLAN.

Use good MM and you will be profitable. Only have one trade open at a time till you have broken even before thinking of opening another trade. Trust me use market structure, fibbo tools, trend lines, support resistance and do not micro manage your trades. Set up your trades or pending orders and LEAVE IT ALONE to play out. Do it a few times and make some amendments. THAT IS IT BUDDY. Put in the work, leave out robbots or EA's do everthing manaully before your consider EA's or robbots. This will train your mind and your sixth sence to trade in the Zone. Also read some forex books too.

My Two Pips worth.

Hello everyone

Thankyou very much for starting such an interesting thread. I've only just started reading the thread so I must apoligies first incase I repeat questions what have already been answered.

I am new at this and I am doing alot of learning and research before I go live.

Could anyone tell me when your drawing your lines to spot divergence on your charts and RSI how do you know which side of the RSI and candlestick you start from. Example how do you know when you start drawing lines from the top of the candlestick and when do you start plotting them from below?

Does the RSI setting have to be 7 ?

From the memebers who are running this system, what is your average win/loss ratio?

Thankyou very much

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
Hi Sandy,

Yes, you are very new indeed to forex from the sort of questions you asked. Not a problem, we all started from some where too.

First, you need to open a demo account and start trading what ever you think is right, do that for a while and you will start knowing where and what to look for. You have to put in the work Bro, no short cuts here at all. Hope you have been on baby pips if not you need to go to school on  the site. Most poeple started from there. Also, stick to one strategy as you can easily be jumping from strategy to the next for months and still be no where. Read forums, read articles and read books. Yes, it is not work in the park at all. Wish you all the best.  Look webinners to attend all this will develope you in time.

My two pips worth.

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
Thankyou for responding to my post,

I'm sorry if I come across like a novice but ive been trying to take that much information in I am getting confused. There is so much to learn and understand.

Now that Ive slept a bit hahah I can see if the price is making a higher high then you would draw the line from the top and if it was making a lower low you would draw the line from the bottom. Something so simple had me so confused but I think I am trying to learn to much to soon.

Ive taken a look at babypips and I am slowly going through the school.

Regarding this topic - do we have a post somewhere what detailed the whole system and what to look for entry and exit etc!

From my understanding so far I feel keeping it simple would be the best way forward, something like price action pure and simple. Thats why this thread took my eye because it was simple and effective, the use of the RSI would also hlep in maintaining winning trades etc.#

Any words of wisdom are welcome

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
Can someone please explain lower highs and higher lows. My head hurts trying to image these and is there a simple way which side of the candlestick you draw the line to see diveregnce? why are some from top and some are from the botttom. I know its simple but ive got mind block thankyou so much.

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
bears in h1 timeframe but market is slow here is the pic

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
Welcome aboard Sandy ...

You want to look at both the highs and lows of candles. BUT, what is most important is that you draw the RSI in the same manner as your candles. So, if you draw your line as the bottom of your candles you should draw your RSI line at the lows (troughs) of the RSI. If you draw your line at top of candles, you should draw your RSI at the highs (peaks) of the RSI.

In case you are looking for a regular bearish divergence (generally in an uptrend and looking for the end of the trend and reversal down) you will want to draw your lines at top of candles and thus at top of RSI. Then you look for divergence between those two lines where PRICE makes a higher high but RSI makes a lower high or stays flat. Please see one post above posted by Vasude (thanks Vasude) where he  drew the line at top of candles (so he is taking the highs of candles) and it is showing the price making a higher highs (i.e. the highs of the price candles is gettign larger in value) and the RSI peaks are making lower highs, i.e the top of the RSI line actually decreasing in value or sloping down (lower highs).

In case you are looking for a regular bullish divergence (generally in a downtrend and looking for end of trend and reversal to the upside) you will want to draw your lines at bottom of candes and therefore at bottom of RSI. You will look for divergence of those two lines, whereby the PRICE makes a lower low, and the RSI makes a higher low or stays flat.

Hidden divergence is a bit different where you are looking for price (trend) continuation and not a reversal.

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
well, it is not there yet, and there is no candle confirmation as of yet of course BUT, there appears to be diveregence forming in EU near a previous resistance (may becoem support) zone of 12550-12530. Keep an eye out for this zone just in case we may get a setup.

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
looks like we have a setup on EJ for bearish hidden divergence and price continuation down.

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
Usually I look at somewhat correlated pairs when i trade and in the two examples above I see a conflict between EJ and EU, which I generally like to see moving in the same direction. In this case one is telling me to go long and other is short. I do not like to see that and I liek those two pairs to be lined up in the same way before I trade.  Although EU is nto there yet for a bullish setup .. so maybe it wil continue down with EJ and we never get a bullish setup on EU

WOW, news was very bad for the euro obviously and that cancels our H1 setups long.  HOWEVER, if you look at H4 now, we have hidden divergence on EU ane EJ, and 99.00 level on EJ is huge support.  so maybe we get a long setup now with  hidden divergence on EJ

Hi all. I dont get the chance to day trade all that often using this strategy and find myself looking back at the end of the day when all is done and finding simple trades. But in reality its not that simple when its live. Any tips and suggestions would be muchly appreciated. I have been trading for over a year so know all the basics but still at the stage of winning some and losing some. Unfortunately I am on my own as I know of no one who trades. So some companionship along this tough road would be awesome. Here is an example of a lost trade yesterday. I thought it was a definate winner. With divergance showing strongly and a 61 fib and a previous support i thought i was ready to print the money. But no Not so lucky. brought at the high of the low test bar and clicked me in by 1 pip before shooting down. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Love the thread and the strategy to guys.

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
Thankyou so much for explaining something very simple, ive read that much I just couldnt understand it hahaha. Ive finished reading your thread and I find it very interesting. Anything with price action interests me and using it along side divergence looks and seems like a good solid signal.

Another question for you PP

When you have posted charts or other posters I see the divergence but there is also many other divergence within the chart which didnt move in the oppersite direction straight away, sometimes it went up another 2 or 3 times before it turned and went down or up. How do you know its not going to carry on or how do you know its just a signal to tell you there is weakness in the price but its not ready to change direction? I am talking about Regular D here no HD.?

Thankyou so much

This is a pattern I've noticed as well..RSI + candle stick divergence and I was wondering if you have any specific EAs or indicators to alert you when the RSI divergence occurs.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
Sorry, but I don't know much about EAs -- I don't think an EA can trade the same way I do.

Here is the reason:

I use divergences (either Stoc or RSI) along with other stuff, such as S/R, trendlines, and big round numbers (need confluences!). Also, I check other pairs and upper timeframes. The two examples I posted this morning were beautiful in every which way!

You could trade only with divergences, but it often doesn't work good; especially when the price is in a channel (you get killed in next bar!)

Good luck

PS

Probably you can use an EA that gives you alerts for divergences. (I've seen it somewhere here in FF...)

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
Hi,

Yes..exactly the way I trade as well..just looking for an EA to say HEY...there is some divergence here...

Thanks and best of luck to you!

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
I don't know of any EA's but there are lots of indicators if you just do a search. Most however are not very good at picking up the better divergence signs, seems to be better to just eyeball it. I check 24 charts every 1 and four hours (that I'm awake). Only takes minutes.

I have a possible setup forming here on USDCAD but I'll have to wait on it to confirm. My only concern is that this pair has been moving down already and may not have much more room left to go down but we'll see. Looking for a bearish pin-bar to confirm some reverse divergence here.

--- 帖子 #1266 ---
Thanks for posting this setup jd. This might be a good setup because USDCAD is just touching the upper boundary of the falling channel and possibly at the same time hit 0.99000 round number (very close to it), in addition to being overbought and having hidden divergence. A winning combo to me, but we still need to get a confirming candle stick pattern to go short  but it is getting to the end of the day here in NY and things might be very slow now.

Hi there,

Just wanted to say I've been stalking this thread for a few months now, and demo trading this method, and have had some small success with it.

But even more than that, it's helped me understand the momentum of the market a lot better, so I'm always watching out for stalks and indicator divergence no matter what other method I'm trying.

Great stuff, thanks!

I took a -12 pip loss on the usdcad trade but I more than made up for it on this eurusd counter-trend short trade.  Closed this one out at the support line for a +37 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
Now I'm back in on the same pair but on a trend trade with hidden divergence. I entered on the break of the inside bar with a stop-loss just below the low of the red candle before the inside-bar.

**UPDATE: Just closed this one for a +39 pip profit. It's Friday and the market gets crazy around this time so I'm taking my money and running :-)  "Gotta know when to walk away, no when to run" in the words of our good friend Kenny!

Why should use RSI 7, what is the reason? if you use the default RSI 14 what happens

--- 帖子 #1275 ---
Ive found that trading divergence on 15 min doesnt really produce a long swing, but rather is the starting point for divergences that may be setting up on 1hr and 4 hr charts. Take 15 min divergences to points of resistance/support, then expect further pushes in the origional direction of the trend which in turn sets up divergences on 1hr, and then again on 4hr... obviously this takes a lot of trade management but can be profitable.

Keep watch on each set up and manage the trades if you have the time, obviously as people have said, stick to 1hrs if you dont have the time to sit and manage each trade.

--- 帖子 #1276 ---
This is a little more spread out than I normally like to see but divergence is in play so I took this trade.  Up +3 so far.

This one ran for over 10hrs before it finally took off and went into profit. Max drawdown on this trade was -5 pips. You gotta love those trades.

Anyone with a dashboard for this system to monitor many pairs.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
Thanks mate, I was searching this type of trading setup ..!

Simple and effective..!  Read every thing and got knowledge, but yet I would like to gain experience in demo first ..!

I will be thankful, if you guide me..!

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
Yeah a dash board would be great, anyone know any coders that could work on it?

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
yes i too have observed it...divergence on M15 is the starting point for divergence on H1, usually,    --combination of  support,resistance ,pin bars, engulfing pattern, doji, with divergence gives excellent results.

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
Well, in about 27-minutes or so, I'll know if I have a potential setup here. I'm looking for this to form an inside bar and then I'll enter on the break of the high of that bar.

**Update: Inside bar formed and buy stop order in place at .9767 (3-pips higher than the high of the IB)

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
Okay, trade entered and running currently.

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
I seriously want to setup a trading room where we can trade divergence only, of-course we can include S/R, channel and pin bars etc to confirm a divergence entry.

This way we can collectively watch the divergence formation as they happen.

Anyone interested ?

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
Hi,

I just wonder how can one draw on charts connections of highers or lowers prices while RSI is set for apply to close. In this case it make sense if one draw the connection of the closed prices instead of highers or lowers prices. Sometimes the final result of divergences will be different.

Just my two cents.

--- 帖子 #1287 ---

Divergence forming on h1 chart, EURUSD,  Price at supply level on the daily time frame

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
daily supply level, if anyone trades that way.

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
Hi dude,

I'm new to this system and also notice that divergence, but I was not sure of that ..!  Thanks for confirming dude..!

I'm so helpful to you..!

I'm also interested in this type of setup and would like to contribute in future But after getting experience..!

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
In my opinion, trading divergence is not as easy as it looks.... Combining with pivots may increase the provability. Recommend Forexcube's threads.

--- 帖子 #1293 ---
Well, I'm interested.  I will point out that I make it a point to focus primarily on hidden/reverse divergence. I trade counter-trend here and there but primarily with the trend.

--- 帖子 #1294 ---
Of course you need to exercise due diligence, have a method, have a focus point but it's not rocket science. Divergence is extremely reliable when combined with other things, most importantly, risk/money management. Divergence around pivot areas are very good setups. I agree with you on having more than one confirmation but I don't think we should get caught up overthinking things.

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
True but I'm looking at the div on eurjpy H1 chart. I'll go with this one since it is with the down move.

--- 帖子 #1296 ---
What indicator do you use for div? I use RSI-7 and there was not divergence on EUR/JPY today.

--- 帖子 #1297 ---
stoch 14.

--- 帖子 #1298 ---
Yeah, this is one of the troubles with divergence. AFAIK it does not show up on all oscillators at the same time. Have to admit, I have not tried to find settings which would yield consistent results though. Anyone done that ?

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
Trying to get some profit. There is div at the Fibo Pivot (Resistance-2) on H1 chart and good level on D1.

Generally it is said that divergences fail more ofthen than not. I would gladly see some hints, tips, information on how to find or filter high probability divergences. There are many kind of the well known divergences between indicator and price. The basics are regular and hidden, these may differ on several points.

There are different hints, for example not to use normalized indicators (like RSI, Stoch), indicator must cross 0 line, must cross signal line, over-under divergence, combination with Bollinger Bands, the "Missing Right Shoulder" type, multiple divergences. Class A,B,C makes difference on the slope/angle of the divergence lines. Filtering choppy markets or previous trends/ranges, filtering on price / indicator value ranges between 1st and 2nd point. How much difference may be between the price and indi. peaks, what is the best minimum, maximum distance of the 2 peaks. Combination with another kinds of divergences may also increase the probability, for example momentum div. with volume div (eg. MACD+OBV or PVT). The divergence becomes invalid on some conditions, for example when price breaks the 2nd peak. It seems it is better to consider failed when the momentum indicator exceeds the second point of divergence.

(I thought of filtering insignificant indicator peaks with added Bollinger Bands on the indi.)

There are at least 30-40 indicators or maybe many more that can be used finding divergence, some better than another. Generally the MACD and OsMA are considered the best, but there are many more which seem to be good enough.

The best entry signal or a combination of signals is also a good subject to discuss.

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
Thanks for your input. You can certainly add as many conditions as your heart desires, but the more conditions you add, the more complicated the setups become, and the thusly the less frequent. This is meant to be EASY (as the title of the thread states), and not over complicated with too many indicators , filters and conditions. We are trying to keep it simple and not fall into the trap of "paralysis by over analysis". We have one indicator for divergence (you can use an alternate indicator instead of RSI if you would like) and candle stick formation at significant price levels (R/S, pivots, round numbers, TL, etc) as our filter, and breaking the low/high of the signal candle (by a few pips) as our confirmation of price action.

I'm watching CADCHF, H1

It's interesting setup - PA right on the green, but should be careful for the yellow zone..

--- 帖子 #1307 ---
Very, very well said PurePrice. We need one indicator to show div combined with a candle formation (I use pinbars) confirmation and act!  Pure price action trading. No need to overthink. Stack the odds in your favor and pull the trigger. If you win, great. If you lose, forget about it, and move on.

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
OK, I see. I did not mean to change your strategy, only to discuss some things that may improve divergence setups. Most of the mentioned conditions are built in my divergence setup indicator and in fact this makes analysis much less paralyzing :-) by filtering out the setups, markets that are not worth looking at. The indicators are not even displayed only the setups on the price chart. These conditions are usually not too complicated, some are visually quite easy to see (probably not at first sight). for example oversold points what signal failed divergence 2-3 times before it actually happens. The result of the "missing right shoulder" (by Alexander Elder) is usually an immediate strong rally.

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
Just became a member today. Looking for a Hidden Divergence forum. I am not a full time trader and usually looking for a trade at the end of a day due to my job. Today happens to be my Flex Friday off. So, I will be looking for a divergence set-up on 1hr/4hr/Daily chart.

Look like the system is very straight forward without a lot of analysis. But I have added one more confirmation to the setup. The Trend-line(TL) break must be with the cross-over of the MACD before taking a trade.

I am using the MACD default settings. MACD provides the added momentum to the setup.

In addition, instead of taking all the trades, I look for a trend. What do I mean by a trend?

If the trend is up, I try to take only for the bullish HD.

If the trend is down, I try to take only for the bearish HD.

I have been back-testing to see how it works out. So far, the result seems to be satisfactory.

--- 帖子 #1311 ---
Thank you for your tip! I also get positive backtest result. I'd like to use CCI 0 line as an exit signal.

Thanks

Hello PurePrice,

The following EU H1 chart is showing two divergences, I am new to the concept of Divergence trading and ofcourse a little confused.

If I understand correctly (chance is I dont) the first one is regular div and second one hidden div .. which one is valid in this case and why? If one of them is not correct, what makes them wrong? Or is it me messed up drawing them?

I really enjoyed reading your thread and hopefully will be around.

Thank You.

--- 帖子 #1313 ---
Possible AU long?

It finally formed a bullish engulfing bar, rejected from a round number and 61.8 fib level of previous up swing. Any comment?

--- 帖子 #1314 ---
They are both valid, but you can't trade divergence on its own you need confirmation, there was no confirmation of the hidden bullish divergence with candle patterns.

--- 帖子 #1315 ---
Good point,Thanks ohammond. I took the EU short right after the first Div with the 2 bar engulfing confirmation. closed it for 60 pip  Now I am long AU.

The concept of hidden div is still blurry to me, I hope someone can provide some more info/examples on it?

Cheers.

Hi everyone,

This is my first post on this thread and I'm liking what I'm reading so far.

This is an H4 setup so, if anything, it has the potential to give us more pips!

--- 帖子 #1323 ---
I'm new here and loving your system.

--- 帖子 #1324 ---
Hmm this system look similar to my candlestick system and I will like Pure Price to update this thread. Look like he no longer trade this method.

Please how do you place stop loss and what is the minimum and maximum stop loss to place? Thanks

--- 帖子 #1325 ---
Generally stop loss is best placed above/below the latest swing high/low, which is the second (newer)

point of the divergence pattern. When there is not too much price difference between the 1st and 2nd point

of divergence you may consider placing SL at the first point.

Thank you. Am uploading each  now to see the one that works best.

--- 帖子 #1329 ---
Why do you even need RSI though, why not just use the chart, look for signs of outbursts followed by smaller/slower candles and higher highs/lows + candlestick pattern. there you go!

by outburst, i define price climax as any candle where the size is 1.5times bigger than the prev candle.

and the other thing is timing, only take trades around london open, new york open timings and you'll be laughing to the bank soon.

--- 帖子 #1330 ---
Man you are making sense. How do you do your timing? Honestly am tired of many indicators now and so I want to go by the price. Can you post a screen shot of this explanation and how you filter out fake signals, ranging market and spike. Thanks

--- 帖子 #1331 ---
Wouldn't want to hijack this thread, but,

check out "ramblings of a forex junkie" thread somewhere on this forum, my trading method is pretty similar to his.

In general, in order to get positive price action > negative price action, we need to enter at spots where price shows weakness in the opposite direction or strength in our favour.

so this narrows down to a few trading methods

Method 1

1) look for a trend move, i.e. huge impulse candle (larger than prev candles) up after a long down move on say 15 min time frame.

2) watch for a 50% retracement of that candle and enter.

3) bonus points if in line with larger picture trend (i.e. daily trend identified using simple moving averages)

4) more bonus points if its during london or US open timings +- 1 hour.

5) even more bonus points if its at significant areas such as asian low, daily low, weekly low, daily open etc. etc.

Method 2

1) watch for slowing momentum in price on higher time frames, such as H1 after a prolonged move, but still making lower lows.

2) when H1 candles with long lower wicks appear or a green candle appear, (i.e. in a downtrend), zoom into small time frames and see what these lower wicks are - are they from large impulsive candles in the opposite direction? If they are, look to enter immediately.

3) bonus points if in line with major trend on daily.

4) bonus points if during london open/US open timings

5) bonus points if its at sig. areas.

If you have read "One Good Trade" from Mike Bellafiore, you would have heard him discuss "Stock in Play"

Similarly, identify a few pairs that are "in play" in a particular day or session that you trade (if you trade intraday) or in a particular week/month if you trade swing.

Stick to those pairs and try to catch the obvious moves with risk reward ratios of 1:5 or greater, do not settle for anything less.

--- 帖子 #1332 ---
For example, recently, with the JPY interventions, JPY pairs have been in play for quite a while now and they offer really obvious set-ups.

The most obvious pair that is always in play is EUR/USD.

I have started a discussion on this

--- 帖子 #1333 ---
Very good divergence on H1

--- 帖子 #1334 ---
look for strategies with "Pin Bars".

similar candlestick pattern is marabozu.

"1) watch for slowing momentum in price on higher time frames"

with things like this, seems much easier with indicators, for example on macd you see this forming at once.

--- 帖子 #1335 ---
PurePrice nice thread do you still trade this method?

Thank you PurePrice for this thread and all the great participants.

Entry was off the 15 min chart. I call this an almost 'morning star'pattern. Who cares what it's called...it works. I know it's not the suggested Pin or engulfing bar but these divergences are so powerful that I find many ways to utilize them.

Hi there, is there any difference how to use RSI on up trend and downtrend?  Do we need to for an example : if trade is UP - look at bottom RSI to spot a divergence and vice versa? Or just we have to spot it in any way and it doesnt  matter where to draw the line?

....but unfortunately,

I am not able to find a realy good coded rsi-div-indi and/or cci-div-indi, which can show such good trade opportunities and give alerts. There is so many of them, but none is realy good or realy fast especially if you got a div within a few candles.

What I found (paid versions also) is not as good as check divs by myself.

Imagine this strat with rsi 5 and cci 10 div indis which are working together, hunting divs, receiving only valuable alerts.... wow.

--- 帖子 #1350 ---
Yeah I haven't found any divergence indicators that are accurate. They miss a lot of opportunities and do not draw divergence lines correctly all the time. But it's ok cause I do know how to draw them myself. I have traded the 15 min timeframe and had success but I really like the 1 hour for my schedule and accuracy.

Below is a cheat sheet I made when I first started divergence trading, it helped me big time when looking for trades.

--- 帖子 #1351 ---
Well, thank you for the cheat sheet piptime. Very nice.

I thought I am the only one who can`t find a fast and accurate div-indi. You know, indis can bring a lot of profit, but they are kind of dangerous for our mind too. I can say that I am helpless without them, even that I know about the power of trendlines and 25-pip-step-grids.

It is like when you start learning skiing... the stupid and bad moves you get used to very quickly, are deep in your mind and you can`t get rid of them. Stop smoking is easier (at least for me, stoped three weeks ago).

So I go on dreaming about a set of indis made for trading with no brain and 100% winners... lol and lmao

Anyway, divergences are a huge help.

Thanks again.

Please have a look at the thread " rag to riches" or something. That man shows how real traders think and trade.

He uses only rsi 3 divergences in the M30 timeframe and a bit of candlestick-petting like pinbars, engulfing stuff, thats it. I wish I could be that cool...

As I said earlier, examples with settings can be good for all of us.

wildhog setting 8 and T3 cci setting 20, 5, 8, 0

If you look at the H1 chart, you can see we are in a very strong and long lasting downtrend. What I realy like about

wildhog and T3 CCI is, that they even do show the divs in trenddirection. It is very often a hard decision, will the trend go on right now or turn into a pullback, or into a  new trend.

--- 帖子 #1359 ---
I have actually read the thread and was seeing how well I did with trading divergence and start trading his way. I have a friend who started doing his "rag to riches" method, he has been trading for a few weeks now and has grown his account by 400%. I use candlestick analysis with my divergence trades as well. I like the hourly cause of my schedule but at the beginning of the year I should have the time to trade london, maybe then I will drop down to 30 min time frame and trade. Also Supp and Resist is a huge player in my trades. So far good week!

Trade I took based off of multiple reasons. Price came back and tested support for the first time, inside candlestick printed, and hidden bullish divergence printed all at the same time!

--- 帖子 #1361 ---
Guys this is the importance of confluence. When you have multiple reasons like above to enter a trade you greatly increase the probability of success. I do not trade every divergence setup..you will lose more then you will win if you do. I trade divergence that has confluence, multiple reasons to enter the trade. Every trade you take should have more than one reason to enter the trade, I like more than two just like the above picture.

--- 帖子 #1362 ---
Hey piptime,

great how this old thread about div is going on, don t you think.

You are absolutely right with all you say about more than one reason to take a trade.

We can not blindly jump on every div a indi is showing.

--- 帖子 #1363 ---
.... I know about a veteran trader who learned a lot from his father, a trader also.

He says, look for the five "forces" which will bring you the most possible success.

TREND, MOMENTUM, S+R levels, Fractals (meant is MTF) check by looking for example in the M15 if a early entry in H1 is developing and the last force is....can`t remember, have to search....maybe whisky for get the balls to get in the trade or something...

I will check his name, some pics and all 5 forces for you

--- 帖子 #1364 ---
Nice example with actual trades when

three reasons come together. H4 Channel-touch, importand support D1 and the two div indis.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1365 ---
....by the way momentum...

With the  T3 CCI we have a nice momentum indi too.

You know, crossing -100 or 0 or 100 are important momentum....moments  so to speak.

And a strat in itself are divs above 100 and below -100. Check it out for example in the pic I posted

(last Aqua line with arrow up) below -100 aaand up it goes.

This strategy is normaly shown by the regular cci in MT4 setting is cci 10.

Hi Piptime and all. I've been using this method for a while now and i must say it great. The problem I've found is that it gets some awkward trades when going against an established trend. The rules don't say a thing about how to manage those kinda scenarios, so piptime, pureprice, everybody, what do we do in situations like that.

--- 帖子 #1368 ---
Hi Wahnone,

When deciding to take a trade make sure there are more reasons to take the trade then just divergence. Use divergence as a heads up so to speak. After you see divergence is occurring look for where price is at...is it at a place of interest like support/resistance. If so then great...next how is price reacting to that area...what candlesticks are printing. If a certain candlestick prints that has a high probability of making price reverse...then good! Also know when to get out...I hate being in trades for a long period of time...actually I love when price moves 100-200 pips in my favor and getting out. Im usually in a trade for 1-2 hours at most, especially if the trade is against the overall trend. Learn all those things and it will be really hard for you to lose.

--- 帖子 #1369 ---
Wahnone,

Here is a current situation on CAD/JPY. As you can see divergence has printed. I have yet to enter the trade though due to price action. I am patiently waiting for the right candlestick to print before placing my sell. Since there is so much volume to the upside at the moment, once I get into my trade I will be looking for a really quick exit. This has to much upside which means the TP has to be smaller. We will wait and see what price action does to confirm a trade. This is how I approach Divergence.

Well as he is a very successful commercial trader/marketing expert, I won`t promote him here.

But he is one of the very rare good guys (Barry B.)

So his trading is always spinning around the 5 forces:  Trend (MA 50 exp., close), Momentum (any momentum indi),

S+R levels, Fractals (he is checking the next higher tf) and

Cycles of PA (not sure about that because I did not buy his system/course, but I guess it can be a oscillator like stochastic 5,3,3

--- 帖子 #1374 ---
Hey Wolf,

Yes once I see divergence print then I start looking for more reasons to take the trade. Price action (candlesticks), support resist, trend lines, news (if any is coming or just happened). I am a student and continue pursuing knowledge on trading but if someone asked me what to learn to trade divergence I would suggest learning in this order.

1. Support/ Resist

2. Candlestick Analysis (Price Action)

3. Divergence

4. Money Management

After you have learned those 4 things I would then suggest demoing for a few months for practice.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is another divergence example on this pair. This would have been a great trade as well.

--- 帖子 #1375 ---
Piptime,

let us talk a bit about the rsi settings, please.

There are many different settings and nobody knows which one is best.

I use rsi 5, close because 5 periods are a fib-number (fib is important in timing too), 5 is not too quick and not to slow, but the most important part is the levels. I use 15 and 85 as over S and over B. Very good trades are coming from these levels (any tf) and very, very good trades if you get divergences starting from those levels.

--- 帖子 #1376 ---
Actually there was a higher high. You draw the divergence lines on the candle wicks. The second high was made when price went higher than the previous high. Do you know what divergence is? I have posted a cheat sheet chart on divergence a few weeks ago in this thread. I will post it again so you can learn how to spot divergence.

98% true.

To be realy successful we need the 2% missing. Trading with real money makes this little difference. As you know it is the mental hurdle that keeps us away from the money. Technical a 10 year old boy could check the trades and pull the trigger.

Even if you trade with very small lots, but real money on the table is the best mental training you can get.

Hey Wolf,

I also believe 5 is to fast. I am currently using 10 and have had success with it. In terms of levels I never really thought to trade divergence this way, I know those levels represent overbought/oversold but I like to look at the chart and see where price is at (suppor/resist). Usually when price hits these levels rsi is around 85/15 which adds another reason to take a trade. Wolf thank you for your input, I like to try and learn new things from other traders.

--- 帖子 #1379 ---
....you are welcome.

I am sure this is the only way to learn... input from other traders...different views. That is what makes this platform so valuable.

Another thought about rsi 5 85/15... if you work like barry b. and check the "fractals" in more than one tf and look for touching the levels in M15, M30 and H1, you will find some good trades. Check it out please.

--- 帖子 #1380 ---
I agree completely. I have a friend who turned a $1000 demo account into $10,000 in 9 months trading. He then made a deposit with real money and failed because of the psychology of trading with real money was different then with fake money. If your going to trade with real money maybe make a small deposit that is meaningless to you. That way you can truly trade without the mental difficulties of trading with large money. Once you get to large money make note on how you feel when trading. Learn yourself and then make adjustments. Everyone feels differently when it comes to money.

hy piptime,

could you please post your indicator that shows support and resistance lines ?

thanks in adance

--- 帖子 #1384 ---
Hey Piptime,

please have a look at this example of rsi 5, set to close, by using the level 85 (15) and checking three timeframes if price touches the level (blue rectangles) . In this case we got a kind of divergence only on M5.

(It is not about beeing right, it is about exchange of experiances )

Hi Wolf,

That looks good. If you can successfully trade divergence on those timeframes then do it!  I am more comfortable on the hourly and its working for me so im not gonna mess with something that is working .

Below is my trade for the day. I made a mistake on this trade, I went against my trading rules to test something out and ended up losing out on some profits. But the good news is I still made pips on it. Cheers everyone!

Piptime,

that was just a simple example of the settings we talked about the other day.

Divergences in the H1 are the core we are looking for.

What did you try and where did you make a mistake on your trade today?

And could you please post your S+R indi please? That would be nice.

....BUT ONLY IF IT IS A FREE ONE.

Maybe you paid a lot of money for it. In this case, please tell me where you got it from, thanks.

Hey Wolf,

I have attached the indicator that I use for support and resistance.

I made a mistake of taking trades on the 15min tf. I knew that divergence was printing on the hourly but my impatience led me to try and catch the reversal on the 15 min tf. Unfortunately the reversal didnt happen at the time I took my first trade. It took a little over an hour for the reversal to happen, this causes me to put in my trade to soon.

--- 帖子 #1388 ---
Hey Piptime,

thank you very much for sharing your indicator

I had the same problem about impatience today (again....and again...and again, oh boy). 77 bucks gone, great.

Same old story, losing is only about mental weakness, grrrr.

But with our little strat we will make the money back quickly.

--- 帖子 #1389 ---
....but it is not wrong to take the trades in M15 at all. Finding a early entry in M15 is great when we are trading in H1...BUT..... (there is always a big but, they even made a song about it years ago)

...the art is to wait patiently and widen the stop to let the market breath a bit, just in case...

As I said, a ten year old boy could do it, if only our mental hurdle wouldn t be so high....

I don't believe there is anything wrong with taking the trade on the 15min tf but I know that waiting for my entry on the hourly works for me. So for me why fix something that is not broken.

I can't help you with the indicator not working, someone who knows how to code will have to.

Hey everyone. Here is a classic divergence trade that could have been taken.

Entry at 121.888. Get in right after reversal candle prints, I highlighted the reversal candle.

Exit (for me) would be at 121.678. Would be a nice 220 point gain.

Reasons to take this trade:

1.Divergence

2.Reversal Candlestick

3.Price hit 122.000. When price hits these round numbers it typically likes to reverse for a bit before making another run at it.

Reasons why I exit when I do.

1. I fear the market, yes it is not my friend. How many times have you got in a trade and it goes your way for a bit and then boom it reverses for a loss? Happened to me often when I first began trading. Get your money in and get it out with profits because making money is all that matters in this game, ego does not!

2.The market dropped 200+ pips in one hour, that is more than enough profits for me, I am very happy with that amount and you should be too. Don't be greedy, that will get you in trouble.

3.I know price is going to make another run at 122.000 but I don't know when it will decide to reverse and do that. Therefore I want to get out before it does.

Awesome Kumetto! Yes this would be an example of Hidden Divergence.

Forming divergence or no?What do you think?

--- 帖子 #1401 ---
Very interesting thread

I base all my trading on the divergence between price and indicator as well as the price movement.

This is the only way of trying to create a leading indicator with decent results as I see it.

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
Hey Kumetto,

On  your eur.jpy trade I would have waited for price to clearly be in resistance area and for a reversal candlestick to print before entering the trade. Remember you need more than just divergence to print to take a profitable trade. I like to have 3 reasons or more to enter a trade.

1.Is price in support/resist area.

2. Is divergence printing.

3. Has a high probability reversal candlestick closed.

Those are the 3 rules you need to live by when trading divergence. There are a few others that can be added in but they are a little more advanced and don't happen as often as these 3 do. These are the main rules that should never be ignored if you want to be a successful divergence trader.

Also I would recommend focusing on one indicator to spot divergence. I personally use RSI with setting 10 on the hourly. It's a little slower than setting 7 but it has served me well in spotting true divergence.

Also I see some problems in your CAD/JPY trade.

I have a chart of CAD/JPY posted below so we can reference and see the mistakes made.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Ok your RSI setting is a little too fast for the hourly. Adjust it to 10 so you can get a clearer indication of Divergence. 7 is good for lower timeframes for other types of trading. I do not recommend anyone trading divergence on anything lower than 1 hour unless they are really really good at trading divergence. If you are here reading this and trying to learn then this is not you.

Also if you are going to use two indicators to spot divergence make sure both are printing divergence clearly. Your CCI is is printing divergence but your RSI is not. Since both are not printing divergence in the same exact areas then I personally would not take this trade.  You cannot go that far back on the hourly timeframe to try and spot divergence. The divergence you have on your RSI is a high from Nov 4th which was last Wednesday. Alot has happened with news and what not. You cannot go that far back and make an accurate divergence trade. Remember divergence is from the last swing high which is where I have my divergence marked on my chart which shows that no divergence has printed.

Keep studying charts and spotting true divergence, if you keep studying charts you will eventually know where divergence is likely to print before it even prints. Thank you for posting your charts with your trades, although they didn't end up being winners for you it will help others greatly in studying and learning what is divergence and what is not.

When trading divergence, do you consider the trend of the current time frame, and the trend of higher time frames?

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
Great thread..love Divergence!! First time I saw this..Glad you started it and that it is still going.

--- 帖子 #1408 ---
I will be glad to help. I am a step further, where I have the divergence plotted to the chart as arrows. Look for the divergence at several time frames for confirmation.

I found that the 1h and the 15m is most relialble. The 4h can mislead you. The 1h is following cycle of the market in a good way. The Daily TF I believe should have just 5 days in a week to use. One major drawback with the Daily, is that divergence can arise and vanish during the period. This is only to be used for long term trading.

EURUSD currently looks like this.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Also bear in mind when trading after divergences, that the opposite is convergence. This will always succeed divergence. The divergence spots on the chart are giving a pull in that direction. Afterwards, be patient and follow the convergence.

Try differenct indicators or make you own. Test different ones, when you settle for one stay with it. It will never be 100% correct. If it gives you the right direction at the majority of times (>60% or higher), stick with it. The first ones that pops up in my head are RSI, CCI, OBV etc. Those are used for divergences trading. Also the MACD is often glanced at.

Learn to use it and to see its signals. Also the trickiest part with divergence is the entries. Also be patient here. I have found traditional support- and resistanceareas as most useful for this. Also compare price and the indicator at the peaks and the bottoms. This is very often a good suggestion for entry. Things will turn at these points.

--- 帖子 #1409 ---
Below are some charts that shows why you should look for divergence on several TF`s. This increases the likelyhood of the divergence beeing correct.

Also strong divergence on several TF should be plotted to the chart for later reference. When making trading decisions afterwards it is useful to know that the divergence exsisted. If there is a pattern of divergence in the direction this is a good signal/confirmation of the direction of the market.

I have highlighted the areas were the divergence has occured at the same time at the 1hour and the 15m TF. The pair is USDCHF.

Also the 3rd picture is of the calculation of the indicator on the 1h chart. I have attached an MA to that chart and the other chart of the 1h. This MA is a good point of reference for price and the indicator you use.

What will happen with USDCHF the coming week? I don`t know. The pair has moved close to 100 pips from the last good bullish signal. There has been a row of good bullish signals on the pair. Now it is close to resistance. I will wait for more signals on the pair.

--- 帖子 #1410 ---
The next is of a pair where I am strongly considering a short position for the coming week. The pair is GBPUSD. Look for the same confluence of divergence on the 1h og 15m TF. Also the MA(white) off the core calculation of the indicator and price.

Here the divergence is not alligned. We also see that divergence not neccessarily is an entry signal. It primarily tells you that the solidity/strenght of the current move is weak and that price will turn the other way.

PA (Price movement, LL, HL, LH, HH etc) and support, resistance as well as trendlines can be areas to look for entry. If you find divergence near such areas it increases the likelyhood of this as a turning point.

One last important thing to know when trading divergences is:

At the lower TF the divergence needs to be stronger. It means that price and the indicator should mathematically goes opposite of eachother (Rising/falling, Falling/rising).

When at the higher TF (>4h) a divergence can be spotted even if both the price and the indicator is rising/falling. By plotting lines you could still spot divergence this way.

--- 帖子 #1412 ---
To get the ones interested started, here is a simple template for MT4 with RSI. I don`t use RSI myself but I consider it to be decent enough for the purpose.

Explanation to follow:

This is a chart of GBPUSD. It shows what to look for. Mainly three things:

1) RSI (blue) in the indicator window and how price behaves. Plot lines where RSI and price is comparable (same levels).

2) The moving average of RSI (black) and price (white) in the indicaor window. This might reveal divergence of the last period they are measuring. Bear in mind that the price MA is sharing the window with the RSI. These are two different entities. The price MA will change afterwards to fit in the window. It is the present signal given this way you look at.

3) How is price related to its MA in the price chart compared to how RSI is related to its MA (black) in the indicator window. If one is above whilst the other is below this is worth noticing.

Nothing is 100%, this will not always be correct. Still this by itself should be sufficient to show correct the majority of times. When used with support/resistance/trendlines and PA. When swithching to the 15m TF, it will automatically change the setting accordingly.

Even though this is a system, use your brains as well. As important is what you see on the chart.

Good luck

Hey all!

So just have really started divergence trading, and took this Regular Bullish Divergence. Just curious on what you think Piptime?

--- 帖子 #1415 ---
Hi Pipdreamin,

good news, you can change your name into "Pipmakin" now.

Setup couldn`t be better. Price came up from level 15 in rsi 5, which means realy OS, into divergence. (level 85 and 15 are key on rsi 5 for me)

Candle shape was good (pinbar), market opening was around and closing level was on fibo 50 from last swings too. (mesured from close to close)

Imagine we would get an alert when all those conditions happening...wow.

As you can see price dropped another 100+pips from my tp. I could have held out for more profits but how many times has type of thinking gotten you in trouble? Its important to not be too greedy. We never know when the market is gonna turn, get in and get out. I am very happy with the money I made off this trade and wouldn't change the entry and exit regardless of the outcome.

--- 帖子 #1420 ---
It is nothing wrong in executing a plan. To use the planned entry and exit. It is an reccomendable approach.

Still, if possible to scale out of the position, close parts of/majority of your position at the exit level. Set the stop to BE and let the remaining live. You have already bagged you profits. The rest of the ride is as close to risk-free as you can get in trading forex.

Never use the TP for the remainder of the position. Move the stop after the price. Set it where it will triggered when the direction changes. Takes some practice, still in the end if you get the hang of it, it will make a huge boost to your trading.

This is just an small addition to your excisting set-up. I glanced at your TE , even though it is an demo account, it is impressive numbers. The sharpe ratio is impressing. A steady climbing equity curve, with low DD and a good Sharpe is what investors are looking for

--- 帖子 #1421 ---

If.... you master the one and only reason we don t make money in trading..... fear.

Or pull the trigger, call it what you want.

Not that I mastered this hurdle yet, but if.....

Only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Oh boy, I wish I could turn this one into reality. = Millionaire

Go Pipmakin, go....

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
What can help in reducing the fear, is to risk a very small part of your trading account. For example < 1% of your account to be risked with any trade. Be modest when leveraging and set reasonable stop loss.

Also it can help to know consider that the current/last trade is not the last trade you are going to take. It is just one of many. If you win or loose on that one isn`t important in the overall picture. The important thing is to be able to grow the account on a monthly/weekly basis.

If you trust your system/methods/edge, you know that with proper risk management you will win more than you loose over time. You will also know that some trades you will loose.

All of this could lead to reducing the fear of a loosing trade. If you can get to the state of mind, where you allmost doesn`t care if the current trade is a winner og looser, you are getting closer to eliminating fear.

It takes time, as well as individually suited techniques, in the end fear can be reduced.

How to you determine TP and SL levels? Do you use a fixed TP? And in this trade the candle at the SR level is more of an indecision candle than a pin bar.

--- 帖子 #1433 ---
Yes i want to know too?

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
Hi Samanfx,

Typically I use price action for tp and sl. I understand and know when I am wrong so I mentally have a SL in place. Also same goes for TP, I have a mental Tp in place but I will sometimes change it if price action tells me to. For newer traders I know this does not help since they probably dont have the amount of hours invested in learning price action as I do. So I recommend studying price action, yes read some books, blogs, forums whatever but also have actual time invested in live price action trading. Once you start seeing the same patterns over and over again it becomes like second nature and somewhat easy.

Also yes this isnt a perfect pinbar. But price is at a hard resistance and has been very bullish for the last few hours. I knew price was going to get to that level eventually and that there would be a sell off. Now how big of a sell off that I do not know for fact but a sell off is almost guaranteed since its a hard resistance. So therefore I knew my trade was high probability in multiple ways, hard resistance, rejection candlestick, and divergence. I made some good pips off that trade.

--- 帖子 #1435 ---
Thanks for explanation.

Do you use SS_SupportResistance_v04c  indicator that you posted in a previous post to determine SR levels? Is it enough so that you don't need to draw SR levels manually?

--- 帖子 #1436 ---
I do use that indicator. However I will make sure the lines it draws are correct and there will be times when it doesnt draw lines where possible support/resist may be. Overall it helps out a lot but always make sure what it draws is correct.

i mean does the divergence occurred at any verified support/resistance line? go to post number 1388 in this thread you will find an indicator shows resistance/support lines, uploaded by PIPTIME

You nailed it on the head fxtradex25. I would have critiqued this trade the exact same as you. There are multiple indications that this is a retest of broken support that was rejected with confirmations of candlestick analysis. This is not a good divergence trade, this is exactly how not to trade divergence that has broken support. This was a great chart to learn from if you are new to divergence.

On NU trade set up:

• My oscillator of choice is Stoch 833, which showed no clear divergence on those candles. However it did show divergence on following HH's, which also failed, maybe because there was no immediate reaction.  Either way, 100% wins (without use of a time machine) is probably out of the question. Having a positive R:R should keep you in the game.

This is UJ on H4. I took this hidden bullish divergence trade yesterday @ 121.30. After a day and half of price not reacting, and breaking previous days low, I bailed loosing 50p.

halk,

i only trade when divergence is confirmed in both rsi and stochastic(high probability), yes individually rsi and stochastic gives their own divergence signals if both the indicators show the same divergence then take the trade.

In the above chart NZDUSD the divergence occurred at normal zone there is no resistance/support.

Better to opt divergence formed at verified or proven resistance/support zone and that divergence should valid in both RSI(10) and stochastic(15,5,5). so that you can avoid false signals

--- 帖子 #1453 ---
Thanks for your reply!

But im using the indicator from piptime (support and resistance lines), its appeared one resistance level when i see the divergence on RSI.

I will try combined with stochastic to see my results.

--- 帖子 #1463 ---
Hi Halk,

I can see multiple problems in taking this trade. I will make the list numerical.

1. Price is on a downtrend so now you are countertrend trading the major trend. That is ok to do but your TPs have to be much smaller.

2. Do you know candlestick analysis? I can see multiple signals to take the counter trend trade right after divergence has printed that would have yielded 100-200 pip gains.

3. If you are new to trading divergence please stick to trading with the major trend. Price action analysis is very very important if you want to be a profitable trader.

Now I have no idea where your trading is at in terms of knowledge but if I was to teach you I would make sure you knew these things like the back of your hand.

1. Support/Resistance. Know how to find it and draw your own lines before adding an indicator that does it for you.

2.Candlestick Analysis. This is huge. Combine this with support and resistance and you have profitable trading.

3.Price Action Analysis. If you want to really reap all the rewards of trading know this. Once you have this down you will be impossible to beat.

Once you combine those 3 things with divergence you will be a forex assassin! Buy books and study study study. Once you have memorized those three things start looking at charts. Dont trade just look at charts and study study study. I promise that if you do this you will get so good at spotting trade setups you will do it without even thinking about it!

Thanks for your answer!

Yes i know about support and resistance lines, but i tried to follow that indicator what i said and i made the trade on one support. The candlestick what i see, it formed one pinbar, not closed full but the main idea what i see on the candle is it, thats the second reason why i bought in this example.

From 2 months until now, im studing much price action, how the market move, i see have several forms of trade price action...

For example: harmonic patterns, wolf waves and others... but im trying to find one easily one to trade

Because is hard to find one pattern, of course, for who trade with, combined with support and resistance levels, have great results.

Thanks

These are 3 places I learned about divergence trading. Over at James 16 thread I came across a trader named Ryanmcd whom I first learned about trading this way. The link below is to his charts. Just plow through them...hunt around and you'll find lots of info.

The Jankone link is to a trader who learned from Ryanmcd...he too is a good source to learn about divergence.

Range Breaker is right in the ballpark. Enjoy

As you can see from the long wicks that this is a heavy supply and demand zone. My expectation based off area, divergence, and candlesticks is that it will reverse and hit tp. But only time will tell!

Hi Piptime, welcome back! This is exciting news, as your thread helped me in learning to identify divergence. It's the perfect tool, and best of all, simple. So, thank you for your selfless contributions. Here's a trade that I took earlier that worked out perfectly on eur.gbp. Although I use TDI, it's still based on the 13 period RSI. I love divergence!

--- 帖子 #1472 ---
Hi Kei78,

Makes me happy to know that this thread and my post have helped you become a successful trader. I use to trade with TDI back when I first started trading but I didnt use it for divergence. I had no idea what divergence was and used TDI to trade a mechanical system called Trading Made Simple that I found here on ForexFactory. Since then I have stepped away from "Systems" and trade only divergence with chart structure. Although I did not recall TDI having RSI in it but at the same time when I used it I really knew nothing about the components of it. I see that you are already following me if you would/could contribute to this thread to help others like I have helped you that would be great. If not no worries I will continue teaching!

--- 帖子 #1473 ---
No problem, I'd be happy to post potential setups or trades that I've taken myself. So that everyone is on the same page, I can use RSI. So, you have switched to the 10 period from 7?

--- 帖子 #1474 ---
Hi Kei78,

I do believe I have always used the 10 period on RSI.

Ok for people who are newer I wanna show you an other indicator that is great for spotting divergence easier. Below is a picture of the Awesome Oscillator printing divergence on the 4hr chart recently. And yes I did in deed take this trade.

Hi again, looks like your trade was a success! I don't trade that pair, but it was beautiful. I agree, I think that the AO indicator is really good at detecting divergence. I didn't really trade today, but I'll check and see if I see anything later on today.

--- 帖子 #1476 ---
This is the USD.CHF on the 4H chart. It's a trade that I actually saw setting up, but I forgot about until I came back to look at my charts and I saw that she moved to the upside, as predicted. It would have been good for a good 50 pips, and would have been the perfect end to the trading week. In my opinion, support and resistance, price action, and divergence combined are a BEAUTIFUL concoction. Rather you have dreams of catching as little as 10 pips a day to over hundred pips a day, this method can get you there. I hope that everyone has a safe weekend.

Price is at support CHECK.

Valid Candlestick. CHECK.

Divergence. CHECK.

Lets see how this plays out!

Remember to always manage your trades, I will often pull my trades before desired TP because of price action analysis.

Ahh I love this example of when not to trade Divergence! Sure divergence has printed and a valid candlestick has printed. BUT!!!! Price is not yet to resistance. If you zoom out just a bit more.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You will see price is close to a really strong resistance. Personally this is not a trade for me, it is to risky, I can see price running up to 1.31400 to 1.31500 before reversing.

I am personally eyeing the 1.31400 to 1.31500 area, lots of confluence in that area if you look back in your charts.

And tp has been hit. Nice divergence scalp!

OK now that I have bagged some pips let me tell you what I think this pair will do. Based off of my technical analysis I believe this pair will continue up to the 77.000 area and then find resistance. Now the reason why I didn't set my tp in that area. First off the time of day it is for this pair. The Yen and the Aud are no longer in their time session, which means less volume, second reason is my time in front of the screen. I know I wont be in front of the screen after the London closes, so If this pair still hasn't made it to the 77.000 level and its ranging I would have to close my trade per my rules ( I do not trade if I am not in front of my computer screen watching). 3rd reason is I had strong belief that this pair would indeed go up and hit or come near my desired tp in the time frame I have to trade.

You see sometimes you have to be reasonable with yourself and take reasonable actions to be a winning trader. Set your rules and follow them!

My analysis is possibly wrong here. As you can see the USD/CAD is now dropping. If you are a divergence scalper like myself you would have bagged some pips. BUT...I had a plan and I stuck to it and that is important to me. You can have a plan and be wrong and not lose...just like I did. I didn't take the trade, sure I would have hit my TP on this trade BUT per my analysis and rules I didn't take the trade and I didn't LOSE! Forex is constant and your learning should be to. I am fine with not taking the trade...there will be much more trades that will line up with my plan that will be winners! Stay positive my friends!

Guys here is another divergence example I want to talk about. Looking at this chart you can see that there is clearly divergence from the .75500 level all the way down to the .75000 level. Now im sure some people would look at this and not really know where to get in the trade at. Or maybe they are new to divergence and would get in as soon as they see it print. BUT I want to show you how many people can make the mistake of getting in to early and losing. I will say that just because Divergence is printing that doesnt mean its a good trade. and this would be an example. Now I will show you exactly what you could have done to get a better idea of when to take the trade.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

As you can see I have zoomed out so that I can see what the bigger picture looks like. Now after zooming out I could clearly see that the support was around the .75000 level. Now with divergence already printing and the market dropping from .75500 I would be looking for a trade at the .75000 level not at the .75500 level. Guys sometimes divergence is not as easy as it seems, sometimes you have to look at the big picture to understand. Remember confluence is key to being successful divergence trader. Stay tuned!

Called out yesterday that price would return to the 77.000 level. Although I would have bagged some major pips on this one I do not regret getting out of my trade when I did.

Although I had a intuition that price would return to the 77.000 level I wanted nothing to do with holding until it did because its not my trading plan!

hello piptime

i think you are doing excellent...

i am trying since some weeks with the divergence (the only set up with good propabilities i found is on 4 hour timeframe ..) i ..try also the hidden  which is very interesting also...

as you look  very experienced on this matter would be very usefull for us to gice some explanations of your trades... because not all divergences are accurate

anyway   any help on this very interesting maatter would be appreciate...thnx  in advance

--- 帖子 #1498 ---
Hi KouKou,

Check your message inbox.

My trading style for Divergence is simple. I will list them below in order.

1. Structure. Find support and resistance

2. Wait for price to enter into support/resistance.

3. Verify Divergence has occurred.

4. Find valid candlestick to enter trade.

5. Set SL and TP.

6. Monitor trade.

7. MAKE MONEY!

Seven easy steps to be successful! I know there is a lot to those steps, like understanding market structure, understanding price action/candlestick analysis, understanding divergence, where to set SL and TP. I have considered teaching my style and might possibly do so if there was enough interest to do so. I will continue to post in here, on twitter and my blog in the meantime. If you would like to post charts and ask questions I would be more then happy to give my opinion.

--- 帖子 #1499 ---
thnx for the reply piptime.. hardest thing of  my world step 2

--- 帖子 #1500 ---
Patience is key. Divergence trading is not a glamours style of trading. You will take less trades then most traders...but that also comes with higher probability trades. I use to trade systems that would have me in the market all the time....I was not successful, I blew accounts. It wasn't until I started studying structure and candlestick analysis until I became profitable. Once I learned divergence and added it to my trading I stopped losing. Sure I take a loss here and there but might be 1 out of every 10 trades, honestly.

--- 帖子 #1501 ---
Hello pipitime, how are you?

you are using a really great strategy. i have some questions in my mind regarding it.

1. what are the things which we should keep in our mind when the price is at support and resistance

2. if we observe divergence which says for a LONG but it is at a strong resistance what we should do

3.what is your opinion about about weekly pivot points

Thanks in advance.

green pips to all

Hello Andy ...anytime you can any comments on this trade would be helpfull

--- 帖子 #1503 ---
Thank you Piptime for the indicators

--- 帖子 #1504 ---
Hello Samartha2,

Those are great questions, let me answer them. When price enters support or resistance its now time to start looking for divergence, usually it is already in the process of printing on your RSI. Once you notice divergence is occurring you start to look for reversal candlesticks. Examples would be pinbars, inside bars, railroad tracks, engulfing bars, etc etc. Im not sure I completely understand your last question. If you are saying that price is below the 30 on the RSI and divergence is printing but its at resistance then I would avoid this trade. It doesn't follow my trading rules so its not a valid trade setup. I think pivot points can probably be useful but I don't use them. I am in no way saying do not use them all Im saying is that I dont use them because I have been fine without them. Thank you for your great questions, if you have anymore please do not hesitate to ask.

--- 帖子 #1505 ---
Hi KouKou,

You have alot of different analysis going on in this trade which is good! So based off divergence this would not be a valid setup and I have attached a picture as to why. You draw your lines on your chart and RSI from the last swing high and or last swing low. So as you can see in the picture below you have your line off a tad on the RSI and chart. But with the analysis you have drawn and there being a resistance at the 0.73000 level and a valid inside candlestick printing in that area this is still a great trade for scalping. I do trade divergence but I also trade based off price action and structure and based off of price action and structure this is a good trade, good job!

As you can see the candlestick to enter the trade at first is not so clear. So what you do in this situation and actually I recommend doing it all the time, is to switch to a lower timeframe. By switching to a lower timeframe you can find better entries and sometimes more clear entries. Below is a picture of the 15 min tf and how you would have spotted two entries before price took off.

thanks for your constant updates, was reading through this thread all yesterday and plan to back test over the weekend. Will try my look from Monday.

--- 帖子 #1519 ---
Happy to hear you will be testing out divergence. When back testing remember to use the rules of this style of divergence trading.

1. Price needs to be in a support resistance zone on hourly chart or above.

2. Divergence needs to have appeared on RSI.

3. Reversal candlestick has printed.

4. Set TP and SL to your trading style. Some people like bigger targets and others dont. I personally dont shoot for the moon but like to grab a small piece of the move.

--- 帖子 #1520 ---
thanks for the tip, I always set tight stop losses. I will be using pivot points to decide on TP. Will keep you posted on how I'm doing.

I entered after the second pin-bar candlestick printed. Set my SL and TP. Did a classic 1:1 SL and TP with SL management. Once price hit 70% of my tp I moved my SL to half of initial stop loss giving me a 2:1 at this point. Once price hit 90% to tp I moved SL to break even which eliminated risk.

Took this trade yesterday on the 4 hour charts. Classic Divergence trading, came close to 75% of TP but didnt make it so trade is not at break even yet.

Hi all, here is my take on this strategy:

I built a python backtest system and checked this strategy, looks like it's something there. I guess manually it will be easier to handle (if you see it turns out into a trend you can take advantage of that) but even if you go full mechanical you can get good results, at least with the time period I tested: GPBUSD: 02/2023 - 11/2023, it depends on your tp/sl ratios but for me it was around 40% win rate with 3:1 RR which is great including commissions, there is always the danger that it might be overfitted but I think it's still something there worth of exploring.

--- 帖子 #1540 ---
Thats excellent! I have had great results in the past, better than any other method I have traded. I use a 1:1 RR or use structure for TP/SL which is greater than 1:1. Just depends on the market.
