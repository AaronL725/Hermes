Strategy Summary

✡ Trade without Emotion ★

Entry:

Maximum Leverage for the 1st Entry with reinforcements on 90 pips interval--> 5:1 (on leverage account 500:1)

When price is far far away from Ichimoku Cloud, or equivalent (MA70), do open trade expecting approach to it.
TP 30/50/70 pips -- LOOK ONLY on high Time frames to find this, on 4h TF and daily TF combined....

If you can, try to enter on trade after sharp fall of 45/90 pips, when you are longing/buy. --> TrailingBuyLimit

I only reccomend trading this type of pairs:  Europe vs Australia VS America (1)*

When price is against you, use pyramid on:Automatic pending reinforce on standard level price, interval of 90 pips...example 0.1+0.1+0.2+0.4+0.8 LOT. change TP accordly in all positions to get jump off => BreakEven

(1)*don´t use pairs like eurgbp, eurchf, eurjpy
use it on eurusd, audusd, usdchf, ...

Example of finding reinforce point (90 pips gap), after break the "neckline"
http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1372888396you should use this EA to pyramidate...it changes the TP of all open position if the pending order is triggered! after TP hit it creates TrailOrder * thanks to Gumrai and chjungen* http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=6826033#post6826033 The EA will not open 1st trade automatically, you have to manualy start the trade by pending or trailing or simple market, because of that reason, it can´t be backtested the way it is made. If you have doubts, contact me or search and test on link above how to switch on the EA. Please note Im still improving some minor bugs. Examples of other Pyramid (0.2+0.4+0.8+1.6)

Example of changing TP to BE on Pyramid

"you buy 0.2 at 9200, with TP 9250...

...price goes against you...

you buy 0.2 at 9100, you change the TP of both open position to -> (0.2*9200+0.2*9100)/(0.2+0.2)=9150

...price still goes against you, and TP is not hit...

you buy 0.4 at 9000, and change TP in all 3 position to -> (0.2*9200+0.2*9100+0.4*9000)/(0.2+0.2+0.4)=9075 "

Patience, understanding, love...most of all, we need love ♥

medium margin used

SL just below trend line:

--- 帖子 #4 ---
looking to daily,weekly and monthly, the cenario still bearish, because price arrived top of downtrend lines, and even if it´s going to break it up, before of that we should see price giving the ideia of continuation of downtrend, at least until 50% fibo...

if this this support 1.2830 (edit 1.2827) doesn´t hold, prepare too see, 1.2740 and probably lower, near 1.2600 at 50%fibo, since this type of retracement to only 50% is usual to see in pronnounced mooves like that climb up...

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I´ve consider also horizontal support, and because 26 Setember the low was 1.2827, I´ve just

Changed my SL to 1.2824

--- 帖子 #6 ---
incredible, stayed on trade by 0,5 pips...or at least it seem to be...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
sleeping already, staying alive, risking 18 pips to try to win 100 pips or more, justified this trade...the big picture is as decribed above, maybe before going already to the fibo´s area,  price continue inside of the triangle on 8 hours, before big decisions!good night

good luck

SL mooved to 1.2996

--- 帖子 #14 ---
price will keep mooving inside the traingle, and I´m pointing this "new change" on the zone...the upper line could have lowered, the previous high was only a shaddow, on 5th October, so this can be our actual picture...

the things are tightening up

It was not famous, the triangle was broken, but with no much confidence, but as we are using HighTime Frames, it´s not mean necessarily the breakout is ended...i´ve been without cpu this week, i will try on sunday reavaluate our scenario and post more accurate and precisely!! have a nice weekend, friends

--- 帖子 #29 ---
it´s not normal seeing after a engulfing bull two candles which when together represent indecision...ally this indecision to the fact we are in presence of double top, and even a butterfly sell on weekly, as previous user mentioned, and we are trapped in risky situation...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
weel, because of this:

I´ve:

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Well, soon expect to raise SL to BE...I´m expecting hold this position until the end of the month...we are now at cruising speed....

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Really nice Xandi....

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I like the fact that you move to BE and you let it ride...... that's how you make money in forex....

--- 帖子 #34 ---
yes, and holding positions medium period of time also... but last times I´m not achieving my favorite trades of above hundred pips...that because last month we were inside of a triangle, and that scenario is better indeed for scalping...once that area is definitly broken, we may enter again on that trading strategie, go with the flow buying dips, until the target we idealize...

thanks bro!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
my friend...!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I would like to see a little stronger sell off....to the round number to 3050....it would be healthier for me to jump on....since I missed the train....

--- 帖子 #37 ---
ok, price is at 1.3078 and 50 pips of profit when you are inside of triangle/norrowing zones was already great...but when you are not inside consolidation zones, we can achieve a lot more going with the trend!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
so good fellows, after 3/4 losses in a row, the better thing to do it´s stop for some days...now I´m back and with new toy Trade Explorer...the fact is we still in that triangle, and many were trapped like me thinking we have just broken it...this day I manage to achieve some pips because have cut the shadow with trend line on that triangle, on 8hours and above...expect next week tests to 1.3000, expect also price going above that level and after coning back to inside of 1..2944/1.3000...today price will end above that 1.2930, everything explained by leaving the shadows out of the triangle!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
well, indeed this triangle/narrow zone is in the last days/week and the range is so tight that 50 pips can fill from the bottom to top...big mooving is coming because traders are anxious but in other hand we have to beware of traps that are occuring...

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Qual triangulo?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
this body triangle..but this on weekly, and I have doubts that it hold till the end of the week in this context, but it´s possible...maybe try a long at chart 2 on fibonnaci 50%, but indeed is risky, so tight your stop loss, or wait for a positive breakout..

So, let´s pick up again this baby, and start to post here my entry´s and my meyhod, with Trade Explorer to show how to manage account of minimum 2.000€ // 3.000 USD

1st trade

Long AudCad = 0.1 Lot 0.9625

TP = 75 pips higher

SL= pyramid..will explain later

&

Long AudUSD = 0.1 Lot 0.9445

TP = 75 pips higher

SL= pyramid..will explain later

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I am here bro.....spying.. on you.....

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Having issues to put trade explorer working, sent email to FF, still have the trades open plus 0.2 Lot Eur JPY since 128.00.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
with this issues on TE, better to close all, until I can put here a Trade explorer working to document my trades.

Closed now Audusd at 9546 = 100 pips profit

Closed now AudCad at 9700 = 75 pips profit

Closed 0.2 Lot EurJpy = 25 pip profit

After leaving work will fix this.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Since I can´t connect my Trade Explorer from real account here, Forexfactory still working to make available my broker, I´m using this Demo as mirror of my Real account, even the balance is more or less the same...

I will make my analysis here, and entry points no needed since I use Trade Explorer.

Started with 3.000,00 USD

Enjoy the ride !

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Nice thread xandi, I will follow it

--- 帖子 #56 ---
heeee Tommmoney!! I usualy open 0.1 and 0.2 positions for starting...Don´t know why opened 0.4 on this audusd...can get me in trouble since to reinforce would need Double and triple..hopefully will not need.

Anyway..that talk the other day about not longing AUD pairs because don´t want to pyramid on break belows, forget it...I´ve been longing these pair of days AudCad and AudUsd always with good profit.

I enter any trade who is faraway from MA69(+/-)  or ichimoku cloud on 4h/8h/daily/weekly...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
As you can see, I´ve pyramided today, when everyone could thought it was a nightmare trade, I was able to close it on BE, with discipline, we only need a retracement of 50 pips to close any position on Breakeven:

--- 帖子 #58 ---
...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I´m waiting a surprise until the end of day, and it can be regarding longs..this green daily candle cannot close like that..or close substancial higher, or close in red

On other hand, price reach exactly the Supply Line drawed on chart, which is drawed when the candle shadows start...so, it can be the begginning of another swing down..let´s see, I´ll be here to pyramidate, although in this case I´m with wrong position, should be 0.2 or 0.1, intead that 0.4.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Did yesterday red daily candle canceled the meaning of the last morning star? I checked the daily history on audusd and usually we had two green days after it or even more after some bounce.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
cancelled the meaning since the low was broke, but don´t give much importance to morning star..I have to check it on netdania charts, because on mine I don´t have it, and in yours I can´t understand what day was that (with arrow)..saturday?

Anyway, this present move can go to 50% fibo, 9445, or simple break down all the way, because the swing is clear, price touched that line coming from body shadow candle, line coming from the close of 06 June, and the open from 07 June..next time I must draw that body line.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
That screen was from XTB. I checked it on armadamarkets and it looks different. Have a look

--- 帖子 #63 ---
because of that I don´t give much importance to morning star, speccialy on Sunday´s. every broker has different chart..When I have doubts I use Nedania charts
http://www.dailyfx.com/charts/netdaniachart

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I already saved this link. Good to know

--- 帖子 #65 ---
expect an ultimate drop to 9455, and then, let the the swing up begin!!!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Fractal printed on daily...next will be on 1hour Time Frame...like to be on their side!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
1 hour, fractal will be printed next hour

--- 帖子 #68 ---
nice 1st day..also, I like to scalp news...

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Good morning!!

For those who were talking that ! "If AUDUSD breaks down the History Low, 9390, the line on the sand, will be a nightmare fall" I´ve just only have one word to say:

wrong...

This swing up was easily predictable, I´ve pointed 9455 has the minimum before the climbing up, missed by 15 pips...now price reached the cloud on 4 hours. Finnaly we should stop buying this pair, for a while!!!!...

--- 帖子 #70 ---
You're perfect trading this pair xandi!

I made +50 pips and was prepared to build a pyramid, but it was no need to do this

--- 帖子 #71 ---
ahhh, if you were awaken on asia you have built for sure...I built it, but my problem was not to keep the pyramid base longer, since I bought after news as base 0.8 Lot at 9440(considered basis because price had drop 100 pips from my initial trade) , and should have keep it longer, with trailing stop...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
free style Pyramid last night

--- 帖子 #73 ---
after that trade holding 13 hours, since that I´ve only pure scalp with price action rules...Until we reached the Ich cloud on 4 hours and printed a short fractal, I was only longing, all the time..after that, I started to only short...now I´m going to pause, and think in the next real Pyramid!

ps: sorry to not post chart (fractal & cloud) but I´m out and seeing that chart MT4 on phone...

--- 帖子 #74 ---
You are right here  I had a buy limit 0,04 lot on 9400, but it didn't went so much down. Sometimes it's good to sleep and let it play without emotions.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
everytime!!

automatic trades/pending orders is our Bible!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Understood

--- 帖子 #77 ---
ok, trying a short where Supply line is drawed, as described yesterday on some post of body candle..TP 20/30 pips

--- 帖子 #78 ---
...

--- 帖子 #79 ---
closed..once it was only scalp trade.

If this Supply line work, we can a assist a retrace to 9500. I advise to wait the short fractal to be printed.

ps: since we are looking at 5h candles TF, and this last one started 1 hour ago, many things can happen, if this hold, the fractal only will be printed and we only trade accordly to that after NY session close...MT4 fractal indicator

Of course that in 1 hour we can see it faster...but incredibly, as we are only in the 1st hour of that 5h candle, when I say many things can happen, I´m focus in bulls, which they can have another 70 pip long ride, to reach the previous top...

I´m out this afternoon, I´m at work and at this stage, we can assist 70 pips up or down with same chance of probability..

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hello!

I see you are long from 9637 xandi, I tried to buy lower and my enter was on 9588. Keep thumbs we will go up to make your order profitable.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
heyy brooo!! was a bad entry, I kind was predecting this crap, happened the same days ago, when I posted that "how to draw "supply line" on body candle ..posted this on today US session, before fall happened, with chart below:

...after I will entry the related pyramid orders.

Enjoy weekend

--- 帖子 #82 ---
This week I used less automatic entrys than what I wanted..I used automatic TP, but few automatic entrys...Because that I missed the rally from 9500 to 9600..trying to do better next time, with more automatic planes drawed!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
other strong signal was build on Daily, Bullish Divergence..At maximum we can see a touch near 9520 (user Namitak007 garlet chart) and after bulls will return with strength:

--- 帖子 #84 ---
heyy Tom

good night! preparing for an exciting Asia session, although this time I´m compromised to pyramid!!have to only watch  and see pending trades working(have to wait market oppenning to insert them)! cheers bro, good luck!

good morning crew!!!

NIce one Tom, if I remember well, you are +85 pips this month, which is good!

I´m now focused on eurjpy, on afternoon and night will update charts here on EURJPY and AUDUSD, both pairs I will be trading this week.

keep cool

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hey, you are right xandi  I am glad that its going on a good way.

At the moment I keep two short positions:

EJ @ 126.218 and AJ @ 91.080

--- 帖子 #97 ---
hee.. I have to look better for all pairs again, and try to find one which is farway on higher Time Frames from cloud, and PA levels, as you can see on my MT4 charts.

The chosen last 2 weeks were AUDUSD and AUDCAD..they payed well, if we play it expecting approaching to the cloud, building pyramid.

Now trading eurjpy but not so sure...yesterday Asia session was too much exciting, so no the end, and with profit of 15% day, I ended oppening this short, I don´t remember very well the reason, only know that I build the pyramid pending orders...

Have to study chart better after work...

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Still trying to find a script/EA that allow me to open "related orders", I created a post asking if anyone knew about it, but with no answer...my live broker as that, but it´s not MT4, there I can open "pending Orders" if other "pending order" is activated..there I can also change TP of "Open Order" if the "pending Order" is activated..

If anyone can help, I appreciate!

thanks

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi xandi, I remember you from stevewalker thread. I am subscribed to your journal, how are you?

I had made this trade manager, please go to http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=430310, maybe is what you are looking for, please check it in demo first, I am using it in live, how ever, I think I have a newest version in my other computer in my house, If it what you need I will send you the newest one when I can.

Anything else just ask, maybe I can help.

Best Regards.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
heyy brooo!!! nice to see you!! come aboard!! long time no see steve, Mok1, thodie, budii, you and others..

Many many thanks for your help, will test at home this night!

Regarding my actual journal, I´m showing a well knowed strategy but consistently profit...

pass by! cheers

--- 帖子 #101 ---
thank you for that warm welcome!.

it's a pity that stevewalker thread is closed, I was following his new thread in other forum but does not have the same activity, I don´t see the others too, but always read interesting threads here in FF and I'm in the forex race.

well congrats for your journal, I will following closely

best regards!

nice xandi , my pending order was 10 pips away and did not triggered

--- 帖子 #107 ---
test today that with patience and waiting for the right moment, we can close looser position  in profit..made some mistakes this night, fortunnelly was able to profit...

I have much to learn on this system, or simple leave it on automatic all the time!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
if you don´t, the best strategyr is indeed to play between Price Levels(zone shadowed), on 15tf and 1 hour

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Nice my friend! Go on continue....I like it....

--- 帖子 #110 ---
bro, the day when price go in only one direction about 400 pips, without any retracement of at least 30 pips, I´m out!!

until then, I´ll keep suming!!!

ps: I hope when that day happenned, I have withrawed on this process sufficient funds.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I will start diversify risk, trading aud and yen pairs simultaneous, maybe 0.2/0.1 Lot each!

Open trades now are not example

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Smart solution. I remember that when I started my way with forex, one of my first mistake was that I focused too much on one pair/currency. Will observe how will it work on your account

--- 帖子 #113 ---
the secret here is oppening lots according to size of our account.

I´m with 0.2 and if goes against me, it is not hard to jump off on breakeven, in one pair...

If I´m 2 pairs not correlated, I think I can have also 0.2 each...

more than that, it´s much more difficult when it goes againt your position.

If we have larger Deposit account, with smaller position (0.1 lot), we are always safe, and we can profit every moth a salary (at least  on Portugal earnings , and I think Poland is not different! )

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Same in Poland xandi  In Poland minimum salary is 353 euro. Medium size salary is about 870 euro.

Strategy Summary

Entry:

When price is far far away from Ich Cloud, or MA200, or equivalent, and open trade expecting aproach to them.

TP 30/50/70 pips -- LOOK ONLY on high Time frames to find this, above 4h TF --> Weekly

When price is against you, use pyramid on:Automatic pending reinforce on standard level (interval of 90/100 pips) Reinforce using and on Price Levels Supply/Demand on 15m TF or 1h TF, necessary skills on PA (used by Julexo) -- DANGEROUS MODE, in this mode we trade with emotion, can unbalance the Pyramid Harmonic and Account Margin change TP accordly in order to jump off  > BreakEven

--- 帖子 #116 ---
shorting here, Price action as descibed above:

--- 帖子 #117 ---
closed in good profit! PA movements works good! best trade style by Julexo!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
trading with pending orders it´s beautiful...when you are not expecting, your trade already gone! It´s less exhausting...emotions stay outside while trading!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I´m not with much time during London and US session to post often..I´ll do that on Asia today, post some charts and trade in real time

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hey

Your trades are really emotion free  Many people would not let the game play and waste their time keeping eyes on the screen. I earned today some money on Kiwi and Aud, so at the moment I am out, but I will be back on Asia to look for some extra pips.

Btw, do you use RSI? How do you evalute the usefulness of this indicator?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I don´t look much to it, maybe in the future will.. I use fractal, Ichimoku Cloud, and IL SUP DEM(those levels shadowed)..tonight I attach it here, even you can found it here on FF.

On the future, one brilliant user from here is helping me and he is coding an EA/script in order to enter related orders and pending orders, changing TP when pending is triggered!! It means, all the process automatic in few days! he desearvs a warm

--- 帖子 #122 ---
ok, it seems I will have to Pyramid that f"#$% trade JPY..but since I´m not at home, and busy, I have to pyramid it with pending orders automatic. If I was at home with my chart, maybe I could try to jump off at BE mannualy..but that it´s not the best solution...

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Thanks for the answer

About script it was one of my few findings, after my first pyramid gave mi a profit. It would be extremely usefull  It's a pity I don't know how to do that, but maybe my friend who is more experienced in forex knows something about it and will help me to write it. I will post it if it works. In the mean time I keep thumbs for your succes!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
thanks for trying to help, we are helping eachother..when I mean "on the future", I mean "there´s already" one user here on FF helping on that issue! hoppefully he can code that! on my live broker, SaxoTrader, they have that tool, called "related orders"!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Ok, understood  My broker is armadamarkets and I use MT4.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
in 2 hours we will have important data which will moove and agitate the market for sure, as you can see this afternoon almost without movement...so, maybe I close the aud, don´t know, and focused only on 1 pair...let´s wait and see...

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Big move down bro :/ It would be better if you closed it.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
ahh, was stupid, I had the TP for AUDUSD 9550 and in the last minute I changed it...bahh, should have closed it as I wanted..

The other one I was mentalized I had to pyramid..I´m trading on smartphone, so, it´s difficult to take fast actions...

the AUD indeed don´t look good, it´s mooving on 50 pips, 9550--->9450--->9350...so the best spot to reinforce are on first touch those levels!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
..it´s called pyramid, it has to be built sometime!!!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
ok, have my pending..128.8 on eurjpy and 9350 on aud...

sorry, I cannot take actions on phone, only at home I can do something, will be on asia, until that, let the pending orders work per si!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
see ya on asia!

--- 帖子 #133 ---
these mooves happen very fast, because of that I need the script working, because having to change mannualy all the TP of the open positions everytime some pending order is triggered, is has to be done fast because price in these cases retrace very fast and come back again even more faster...

--- 帖子 #134 ---
ok, AUD long triggered, going to calculate the BE price and change it on both open position...

--- 帖子 #135 ---
TP changed on both to BE, 9397.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
220 pips in less than 1 hour  !

--- 帖子 #137 ---
hmm...was far away 10 pips to activate my pending short reinforced on eurjpy..sniff! could be already closed on BE.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
WELL, FINNALY GOING HOME!!! expect aud on 9250 and then retrace, and YEN at 128.9 or 129.50 and then retrace..until now!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
ok, nothing like being at home!! EurJpy already closed in profit with pure pyramid...

it is missing aud..the pyramid is not harmonic, it was not build so correctly...fingers cross!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
the eurjpy chart..using S/D zones on 5 min TF (on exceptional moments like this with huge volatily I change to 5min, instead of 15 or 1h TF), was easy to reinforce the pyramid on a good level price

--- 帖子 #141 ---
the AUD is being more difficult becase it has no floor(was broken), at this time, so it has to be created...

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi amigo, you don´t use SL?

Hope you recover your positions.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
This aud trades looks risky at the moment. Hope you will go straight xandi!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
you have to read the strategye...it is some posts above or previous page...

It´s called pyramid, built from the top, there is no place for SL..

this time I can enter SL on BE of the last entry, since it´s 10 pips above, and that only because I cannot double anymore..this pyramid was not very well built, but in the end, I have no doubts I will jump off on BE...only 28 pips away!!...

--- 帖子 #145 ---
After falling 300 pips in a row, it must have a retracement, at least of 50 pips...we are not on war, or something!!!

--- 帖子 #146 ---
the final assault!!15 pips away!

--- 帖子 #147 ---
update

once more the zones shadowed working pressure!!

--- 帖子 #148 ---
probably after this I´m going to raise TP to 9320...hoppefully!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
It seems I´m going to be here all night...FOCM is the hardest test I ever seen to this method..the hardest!! even eurjpy which has too much volatility, days before felt 300 pips in 1 hour and after obviosly recover 100 pips...the experience I have on FOCM is that event has direct consequence on 2 days in a row..so tomorrow(or asia) will fall more...a retrace is needed, or I have to close partially some position in order to balance pyramid...

--- 帖子 #150 ---
..

--- 帖子 #151 ---
this Supply zone is being hard to break...only need to go top of it!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
no words to describe...!!! it´s the method working at his best!!!! even in the more hard conditions!!!!

when I start this with 3.000$ wasn´t by chance...on this market and with the size of position I trade, and the leverage account I have, we need at least that, or more...

balance (orange) vs equity (blue)

--- 帖子 #156 ---
both AudUsd and EurJpy jumped off on > Breakeven when natural retrace occured...EurJpy was more easy and gave profit

--- 帖子 #157 ---
now I can enter on the right path...FOCM has consequences on the next day also...AudUsd will test lows, and EurJpy and UsdJpy will test relative highs...

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Tom!! Peepooo!!

I´m not able to show you better how this works on harder conditions than this day!!!

a normal day is peace of cake compared to this!! this is and was the toughest!

the market can twist us, but it cannot break!

Good work

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Was a little exhausted on asia, in other situation I have kept my short on AUD longer, it was a question of minutes because I had to sleep relaxeddd...

This FOCM still being a repetition, everytime does the same move, on the same period of time...

Good morning conterranean amigo!!!

I´m only interested on closing trades => BE...(emotion factor)

...Someday, somewhere, it´s not about how it starts, but how it ends!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I was doing some charts based on Sharpe indicator to my bachelor about investment funds and it was so exhausting that I felt asleep with my head on a keyboard. When I woke up it was after all. Just like a movie

Pyramid works, it's proven and I completely believe into it  Thank you for this lesson xandi

--- 帖子 #166 ---
thanksss!!!   it´s good to hear some friendly and credit words, after hard work!

Points to take:

the difficult task it´s to find where you start scaling, and the interval between orders (FOCM day the best thing is only to start scaling after 150/200 pips against you)

In order to do this difficult task, use Supply Demand Levels (On FOCM I trade on 5 min, other days on 15m and 1h TF)..you can find on attachment.

the great advantage of this method is, when price start to go against you, you are not afraid anymore, because you have a disciplined plan, you smile, and you think "I´m going to Pyramidate"

--- 帖子 #167 ---
11 hours ago, I did open short on AUD near 3300 and long on EurJpy near 128,00...I stupidly closed it on 30 pips profit  so I could go to bed relaxed!!! at least 200 pips missed..

I´ve seen this happen all the times on FOCM, with Asia and London and even US session after FOCM giving to the "Moove" a continuation.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Friends, this started to be a Trading Journal, now it is a Trading System!! So this thread will be mooved to "trading systems" section...Although this thread had 5.000 views this week, almost I´m the only here posting..need to interact in order to improve & amuse!!! keep following

tomorrow(maybe) and next week I´ll start buy again Audusd...:nerd:

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hello xandi, nice to see your thread upgraded , can you explain us how do you calculate the lots in the pyramid ? let's say if I am goin to start with 0.01 lot where to add a second lot and what size ?, the third, etc.

Best regards.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hello peepo!! yesterday was searching you, to share my torment and after the celebration

I have on the previous posts the method, as in the 1st page...

in normal days I use for example an interval of 100 pips between reinforcing double..in your example, imaggining it will be Buys:

Lots     Price

0.01 -- 1000

0.02 -- 900

0.03 -- 800

0.06 -- 700

0.12 --- 600

0.24 --- 500

this is one example..in days like yesterday FOCM, I only start reinforcing after 200 pips, and the first after 200 pips was not double but triple or 4X (example)...the following reforcements always have to be doubling...if you have 3 lot open in the sum of positions, you will open a 3 LOT position...as described above...

there are other Harmonic Pyramids, profitable, like tis one:

Lots     Price

0.01 -- 1000

0.01 -- 900

0.04 -- 800

0.08 -- 700

0.16 --- 600

0.32 --- 500

and so on...the interval can be also not static, should be between 90 pips and 100 pips...or mannually, if you use Levels Supply Demand as described on 1st page

you must test couple of pyramids and find the one who fits you and your account!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
and the most commom pyramid I´ve watched closely these 5 years with huge profit was this one:

Lot      ////     Price

0.01 --   1000

0.01 --     900

0.02  --    800

0.04  --    700

0.08  --    600

0.16  --      500

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I was here when the great movements occurred, Even I post in this thead, fortunaly I was out of the market by then,I was underwater also and could get out with minimal loses with a similar approach to the pyramids

So tell me what is your target with this pyramids ?

becouse for the next one:

Lot //// Price
0.01 -- 1000
0.01 -- 900
0.02 -- 800
0.04 -- 700
0.08 -- 600
0.16 -- 500

is a total of 0.34 Lots, I think you should have at least 1.000 US$ per 0.01 initial Lot.

and this one:

Lots Price
0.01 -- 1000
0.02 -- 900
0.03 -- 800
0.06 -- 700
0.12 --- 600
0.24 --- 500

sum 0.44 Lots a min 1.500 US$ in balance maybe ?

and the last one

0.01 -- 1000
0.01 -- 900
0.04 -- 800
0.08 -- 700
0.16 --- 600
0.32 --- 500

sum 0.64 Lost, at least 2.000 US$ if I am correct,

Or how do you define your target, and balance per trade. As i see in this method is very important money management than entry points.

Sorry if so many questions

--- 帖子 #174 ---
My Target is always 30/50/70 pips...many many times i don´t have to build any pyramid, my target is achieved...

When price goes against me, and I make my fisrt reinforcement, my Target changes to Breakeven (average of all positions)...In some cases I can catch more than Breakeven, as occured on EURJPY yesterday...

You know forex, you have experience studying charts and trading, so you know that there is no such movement of more than 300 pips without retrace at least of 50/70 pips...even in the worst day(like FOCM), and even if the pair has the long term support broken (like Audusd)...

You are right when you say we have to choose well the 1st reinforcment point..normally should be below 100 pips, but if you see something better or that that point is out of swing, you can change it...normally price mooves on interval of 50 pips, or 100 pips, you must watch the reaction and find the swing in order to choose the 1st reinforce...it´s not difficult...I have to put here examples on the following ocasions...

So, that example that I gave, I rarely/never saw it happen, so you only need account to support -300 pips with reinforcements, and depending on you LOT size and leverage level account...

...so, you have to do very well your math to choose the best decision on first entry which leave you confortable!!!

You can also mix this with PA trading, as I shown to you, after a fall of 300 pips it´s more easier to choose the next reinforce/scaling using PA..believe me it´s easier, because you saw the behave of the fall, where Demand/supply zones where created...I´ve shown here some examples on MT4 charts...

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Only to add this note...that pyramid that I´ve been following, it´s a rigid pyramid, totally automatic, always with initial TP 50 pips and reinforcemnts of 100 pips  below...and still is the most profitable account I´ve ever seen...and I see/follow a lot of accounts, not only on free time, but also at work...

ps: the only conclusion I took over this years watching all this, is that Emotion can ruin you...it will make you earn less when you are gainning, and it will make you loose everything, when you are loosing!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
shorting on PA levels on 15mTF, easy and giving good profit! reached 50% after 2 weeks...

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I think I don´t have to explain why I shorted again on the same spot, PA level

--- 帖子 #178 ---
plus, the pinbar on 15mTF failed... down...

--- 帖子 #179 ---
bad choice did not took the profit..now it seems it wants to jump up to the other area 9280..

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I was thinking why you shorted again in the same level

--- 帖子 #181 ---
ahh forget it!!! yesterday was with friends at home, and showing this method, and we end scalping PA hard (opposite of this method), and when I had opportunuty to close both on profit, and after on BEven, a didn´t do it, emotions took care of my decision... as expected..

Now I have the geometric shape ruinned, and because I have 0.4+0.8+0.8=2.0, I´m going to short 2.0 at 9280...

This was a terrible example, when discipline is substituted by emotional trading!!

I will close both 0.8 at BE if I have chance today!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
sorry, in order to do this correctly, I´m going to change TP in all positions (of course if the pending order is triggered, I have to change again all TP)!

take care

--- 帖子 #183 ---
ok, near to close all at BE..one last breath

--- 帖子 #184 ---
doneee!!

so Good Morning, dear friends! I´m new at this section, hoppefully we share knowledge, good ideas and fun and enterteinment!!!

Please read first page and jump to 4th page, because this method is being documented since 4th page.

You are all welcome, feel free to post & interact, have amazing trades

Well done!  End for today?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Don´t know Tom, now that 2 days past gone from FOCM, I want to start longing AUDUSD...as I said before FOCM refects on 2 following days...then, it stops, and since AUDUSD is already far far away from ICH Cloud on Hight Time Frames, I want to go long...so maybe I start today the pyramid, with 0.3 LOT

--- 帖子 #187 ---
warm welcome music:

Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Ok, I understand  At the moment I am short on usdcad @ 1.04755 and long audusd @ 0.92155, both 0.01 lot.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
yahh, it makes sense!! and we are in same side!

expect positive things next week!!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
It sounds very good

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hit my TP @ 92455 +30pips

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Also hit TP @ 1.04455 +30pips  No need to use pyramid  It was good end of this week.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
alsoo mine!!! +50 pips!! CONGRATSssss BROO!!!!!

but..I´ve reentered again below, I´m liking this moove!!!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Great  You had much better entry  but I don't complain, I'm happy of my +30

--- 帖子 #195 ---
next week I´ll be on holidays, is going to be hot hot hot, 35º celsius here, so I will be inside of water everytime, prefereble with a cold drink near!!!

My pyramid positions will be totally automatic, so it´s also a good chance to use the 1st statement:

"When price is against you, use pyramid on:Automatic pending reinforce on standard level (interval of 90/100 pips) ...or...Reinforce on Price Levels Supply/Demand on 15m TF or 1h TF, necessary skills on PA (used by Julexo) -- .... I´ll try to post sometimes, to make you guys jealous

--- 帖子 #196 ---
heeeyyy xandi!

impressice results, subscribed!

I´m not often online, changed my trading similar to you, 4h and above, which give me similar/more pips with less screen time

greets thodie,

ATM i trade only AUD/USD; AUD/JPY; USD/JPY, it gives a great overview of this pairs.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Welcome homee bro!!!!good to see you!!

!keep in touch, we are together, we have lot of fun & amuzing time here to share!!...besides hard trading!

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Nice xandi u r a genius , I was scare after my last big draw down this week, but I am getting the confidence again

--- 帖子 #199 ---
get the confidence bro!!!we´ll tune here the strategye* together!!

I will summarize again our machine:

Entry:
When price is far far away from Ich Cloud, or MA200, or equivalent,  open trade expecting aproach to them.
TP 30/50/70 pips -- LOOK ONLY on high Time frames to find this, above 4h TF --> Weekly

When price is against you, use pyramid on:Automatic pending reinforce on standard level (interval of 90/100 pips) ...or...Reinforce on Price Levels Supply/Demand on 15m TF or 1h TF, necessary skills on PA (used by Julexo) -- DANGEROUS MODE, in this mode we trade with emotion, can unbalance the Pyramid Harmonic and Account Margin change TP accordly in all positions to get jump off => BreakEven

--- 帖子 #200 ---
ok folks!!! closed the position, my TP was 50 pips, I catched a little more, reentering on retrace...and once I´m starting 1 week holiday, and speccially because Monday is St. John Festivity, with huge party Sunday night, I don´t want to hold position by weekend...

If I was inside pyramid, obvious I would have to hold...

it seems also AUDusd has room to go up, so next week I will try to long again and again this pair!!!(automatic trades/pending orders, between dives on the ocean!)

have a great weekend, relax and enjoy! thanks for supporting & following!

Hello Xandi my friend

Very good job !!!

Keep it up and see You around

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Thanks for supporting, bro! I love to have you here

Ps: Thodie, take a time to read the strategye, you will realize why im longing!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
xandi i did, distance to EMA 200 (AUD/USD 4hTF) is huge ~450pips.

Your system work similar to a bollinger bounce system, not every bounce is a success so you increase your position size accordingly.

i added the EMA 200 to my screen, usually i use "only" EMA 5, 20(+ bollinger), 50 and 100.

As a long trader i would like to see a test of the upper descending TL but the wicks of the last candles show a good supply zone.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
You are getting the point...this is more wide and deep than bollinger bands...and do not forget that if you increase/scale/reinforce you have to blink an eye of closing on BE...no be too much ambicious,and maybe with art, you can catch more there!

And if it goes from beggining to your side? Enchanted of life, take your 50 and prepare to another, prefereble better price

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi tom! How re you doing mate?

I bately dont have network here, neither pc..my summary is almost done with explanation on post above...I was tinking on script, for all IF conditions..soon we have this all in aitomatic, we will only have to decide the 1st. entry..paradise!

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hey xandi! I have completely crazy day today and have to do a lot of things beyond tradeing, but I made some nice +30 pips on audusd between different activities  At the moment I have opened short position on ucad. It's underwater now, but don't care, because I have pending order and I can build pyramid

As I promised I will start testing script tomorrow and I hope it will work well on my demo... As soon as I will recognize it's good I will post my feedback.

One more think, but it is about my trading habits... I used to set TP +30pips, but when I started to analize where went the price after it hit my TP I saw that often it could be more profitable, just not to get out from the train which goes in the right direction.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Entered long on audusd @ 92744, TP at least +30 pips, will see if there will be a possibility to catch more.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi X,

Thanks for the pm.

Edit:

Will see if I can get up to speed with your system.

Cheers mate!!!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi X

thx for the PM

i haedly open FF nowadays, but i will give time to read your thread

--- 帖子 #217 ---
i guess price will make one more dive, i have placed a pending long at  91.01. additional a half size at 91.51

4h / 8h / 12h TF

2nd picture, comparing fractals, on 6h chart, looks similar, especially the wicks on MA20

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hit TP @ 93100 +35 pips

--- 帖子 #219 ---
good morning folks!

Sorry not posting much this week, but as you are aware, im in holidays.

Yesterday was here 35*celsius, i had only my head out of water..

Regarding trade, that pinbar on daily show us the way, as expected, north..

Good long Tom, nice trade free emotion

Thodie, that pinbar toldus we dont need another dive!

CHEERS bros

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Thanks  What I said I wanted to take more than usual +30pips. 5 more looks good, but I see I need better entries if I want higher profits.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
nice catch!the secret in this system is also catch this 30/50 pips, if we want more, than we use SL to lock the profit

Im writing down all IF conditions, for example, now I could have go long again only more than 20 pips below last Max.,preferable 50 pips in order to reenter..depends if is trending or not on low TF.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
See what ive told you? Price reached max at 9315 on uk, then retrace 50 pips(9265), and there we should reentered again...simple! Preferable with pending orders...

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Bro's!!! sincerely, on vacation better that pyramid not appear!

Since strategye summary is complete with posts above,i start to share fotos on holidays

--- 帖子 #224 ---
The account still growing!those who keep go long are not bad, for sure! Cheers

--- 帖子 #225 ---
What I said I wanted to improve my gains. It took 3,5 day to reach the level of +45 pips on this trade. There would be no problem to close it earlier with less money, but I was curious how long could it take. I had set pending order in the case it would go wrong, but the price did't activate it during this 3 days. Good entry point is a very good security.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Perfectly traded!you're becoming an egypcian bro!

--- 帖子 #227 ---
HI xandi !

I hope (and it seems) that you are doing well !

Do you think that your strategy could be translated in an EA ?

If so, would you give me clear rules to entry, pyramid and exit ? I could write such EA and do all the back-tests, it could be interesting to see what parameters work best and on which pairs...

Let me know.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hello brotrader!

Yes, thats the proposal, to code this to ea/script...half way is done, i havr written all the if conditions to related orders,that.s all it needs to be coded.

It can be traded any pair, check the strategye summary...I think you use a similar strategye, as I told you before about your Non-cume return chart.

Now im on holidays and writing on phone, next week we talk better!

Cheers

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Okay man, profit from your holidays.

I hope you have warmer weather than us. Here in Switzerland, it's coldly.

first Pending hit actually floating +12

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Nearly 60% down today. Does this call for some kind of tweaking to the system. Do you have the same trades on your live account?

TF

--- 帖子 #232 ---
hey bro´s, how´re you doing?

arrived today from tropical hot, just in time to see mY TP working!

I took a small loss -70$ this time, I desearve it, since I made 2 mistakes disrespecting the Strategye Summary, on the entry and on the reinforcment (I don´t know why you guys didn´t point it):

Entry: I entered when price was touhing te ICH Cloud on 4h TF

Reinforcement: the last one, I scaled only 50 pips below, when should be 90/100 pips...price went down 100 pips and was difficult to jump off on Breakeven.

Hi TF, yes I have similar trades on live account, the dropdown was higer cause I also disrespected a little the lot size entry, should have been 0.3, but I´m at my own risk! it´s supposed to work as it did!

At the end, the system worked simple again,and we do learn and improoved it, that´s the proposal!!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_e6qw8-rprQ...mais+forte.jpg

--- 帖子 #234 ---
exit now +44

@xandi, your last positions were risky and able to destroy your account. Maybe you should add some exit/reentry rules?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
no Thodie, there´s no exit rules, the rules are all written, and if played by the rules was nothing like risky!

I should have entried half lot size for account size (yes I agree), and should only had reinforced 100 pips below and not 50..

even in that way, still worked, because price can´t drop 300 pips without significante retrace after that, everybody should know that!

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Example of reinforce/scaling:

when level is broken, on this pair, count 90/100 pips, like is written on Strategy Summary, like happened on the last friday moove..that should be a reinforcement strategy:

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Another TP hit, +50 pips!

keep rolling, this week I will focus my energye on developing the EA, so I can be enjoying while machine is trading by my own!

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hello everybody,

Today I could see another time how excellent works this pyramid system  I entered long on nzdusd on Friday. The price went down and activated my pending order 90 pips below the first entry. Three hours ago I closed both trades where the second, earned twice what the first lost. Have a look

At the moment I am short on ucad targeting some 1,045 areas.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
fantastic!!! I pyramidated last week with a little torment in the middle, that happen when your trading on the beach!!

You give us another lesson how to pyramidate smooth, with skills and on cruise mode!

you even close your pyramid greater than BE!!!  I´m delighted to see

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I´ll try to reenter long at 9220 or 9200..still have room to go up..if anyone see other good pair with strategye conditions, please advise..

Tom, later will check that USDCad..I´m posting this asia more, it will move harder☆

Thank you, it's nice to hear it xandi!  I am glad that my trades are profitable and what more I can show here how I understand pyramid system. Hope it is useful for viewers and proves the power of this system

--- 帖子 #242 ---
yóó bro´s!

good morning!!!!

I probably wiil have to pyramidate this time, so I´m enthusiatic!!!!

ps:note the difference if we have not a plan...here when we are in bad situation, we turn excited!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Some pyramid on ucad, but closed manualy

--- 帖子 #244 ---
ahahaha..looks good!! don´t remember any trade of yours ended in loss since we meet together!!!days ago I remembered those days on AudUsd thread, when I was trying to show that having a plan and trading without emotion, we will achive profit consistently..you may have joke the secret of Pharao at first, but indeed you were the "fidel amigo" who gave strenght and motivation to start this corner of guide light! we are building pyramid together

by the way Tom, the EA worked yesterday night, go check the other thread you have there explanation how you can make it work, and the fist step is done!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
hi xandi,

today without chart...

possible ending diagonal on AUD/USD on 4h actuall wave e, what do you think?

entered long here... 91.45

--- 帖子 #246 ---
You don't remember my bed trades becouse we met in the best moment  Since we met I had no loss

In the beginning of 2012 I lost some money, becuse I was to greddy. It took me a year to understand all my mistakes and build my mind for another try. My main conclusion was that I trade to emotional. Then I met you who show me how pyramid system helps to throw away emotions. I tried it and it is the best thing in my case  It's great that we found each other in the moment when I needed somebody to push me in the good way and in the same time you could have a motivation to start something what at the moment evolved to a great system

About the script,  thank you for the information, I am glad that it works!  I am going to rest for a couple of days now, but if I have interent in the place where I am going to I will test. Otherwise I will just post from my phone

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I enjoy a lot to meet you!!!as you said, in the right moment!!that´s life!!! keep rolling, enjoy your weekend holidays

hi thodie!! still good pattern on audusd to build pyramid,,,so your longs are safe!!join

ps: looking to monthly, we may expect a 3rd red candlestarting atm.. let´see, if so, jmp off be...

--- 帖子 #249 ---
xandi,

looked at your last opened trades 0.3 lots @ 0.9186 and @ 0.9125

thought that it should have been 0.3 lot @ 0.9186 and 0.6 lot @ 0.9086?

your leverage is high......

just suppose price carries on down from 0.9186 without any retrace.

you average in every 100 pips down with 0.3 0.6 1.2 2.4 4.8 lots etc., where would your last average in be before your account blows up?

don't forget that averaging in and get out @ BE is waisted time and opportunity.

if you trade WITH the trend instead of trading counter trend, your TP could be higher,

don't you think you would be more profitable?

good luck.

Hi yonnie!!welcome!

nice questions!

"thought that it should have been 0.3 lot @ 0.9186 and 0.6 lot @ 0.9086?"...please read 1st page strategye, when I show you examples how to pyramidate, this is not static: "Examples of other Pyramid, used on FOCM (0.2+0.2+0.4+0.8+1.6)"

"don't forget that averaging in and get out @ BE is waisted time"... no bro, wasted time is to lost money, I explain before and you have multiple examples on these 10 pages showing that sometimes you catch 50 pips and other times you catch 0 (BE)...so the balance is always growing, and far away from wasting time!!

"your leverage is high"...for the type of movement of AUDUSD and the levels of reinforcment and the needed retracement(+/- 50 pips) to jump off on BE, I can be on a sharp fall of 500 pips without retracement and even jump off on BE after, tickling only the account!!
BUT ANYONE SHOULD MAKE THEIR OWN PROPOTION AND PLAY CONFORTABLE WITH THEIR MARGIN

look for example to the FOCM action when I was building pyramid, with the sharpest move on the market...I think is on page 7 or 8.

The last but not the least, when I build pyramid I jump off on => BE, don´t forget I can profit also huge on that situation, without being waste of time, again as you said  read careful the Strategye summary!

Thanks for asking interesting questions!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi thodie!

I have a pending reinforce at 9040, as explained before I count  90/100 pips after price break the consolidation line (significant break on previous relative low), an shown on example:

--- 帖子 #254 ---
the counting of 90 pips WOULD gave me the price 9052...could reinforce there, if so, I would be only at +/- 20 pips from BE...Since not, I have other plan...

--- 帖子 #255 ---
pending reinforce triggered at 100 pips gap!

--- 帖子 #256 ---
xandiiiiiiiii

Good luck my friend.

if you dont mind I would like to tell you something.

not offensive. friendly.

I assume that you have an exit strategy > %DD

dont want to tell you this but if not it may destroy account.

pls say yes

--- 帖子 #257 ---
thodieeeeeeeeeeee

how you doin

hope all good

--- 帖子 #258 ---
hi steve! welcome back, nice to see you again

--- 帖子 #259 ---
yes I have the "Strategye", and the only exit strategye in the middle is called Withdraw when I want!

Read careful the Strategye Summary, there´s no SL, only TP => BE.

This has being tested 5 years ago in account that I have access, and it´s account never was destroyed, far quite the opposite...This have some mine adjustments, but the Strategye is done, and coded on EA! I only have to choose the entry point, and the reiforcement point(standar 100 pips below of the broken neckline) (like happenned in this reinforcement on AUDUSD at 9040), and so on...read the pages while there are not so much, it has been amusing time!!!

bro, I trade without emotion (don´t want that again on my trading), I only use pending orders, and I realized that before I used to trade Price Action only to get adrenaline!!

I knew this system and everyday I look over it,  now it´s been tiime to put this into action!

as told before, TP should be => BE.. BE=9098.

This time going to close it 15 pips above, or put SL after price go above BE on BE.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
has shown on both quotes regarding 2 different trades, the best spots to entry orders are 90/100 pips below the neckline..look examples:

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hey xandi!

Rules are easy so why not to earn easy money?  Posting here my tickets I want to show that it just needs to be well set. Good entry point can make trade only more profitable and for sure it is worth of discous here.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Yap, agree, you have refered that on previous post...it´s worth discussion, but at the end, the entry point is not so relevant..applying the pyramid balance and equilibrium, it´s more important than entry point

--- 帖子 #272 ---
hi xandi,

I just made a quick calculation and your account certainly cannot handle a 500 pip  price fall without a retrace.

starting capital $ 3,000 - position size starting with 0.1 lot - average in every 100 pips

0.9200 0.1 lot down to 0.8700 = DD $ 500

0.9100 0.1 lot down to 0.8700 = DD $ 400

0.9000 0.2 lot down to 0.8700 = DD $ 600

0.8900 0.4 lot down to 0.8700 = DD $ 800

0.8800 0.8 lot down to 0.8700 = DD $ 800

0.8700 1.6 lot                           = DD $    0

your DD would be $ 3,100 - account blown up, not even counting margin requirements.

I have been kind to you: on page 3 you said to start with 0.1 or 0.2 lot with a capital of $ 3,000.

obviously had I used 0.2 lot to start out with, your account would have gone much sooner.

also I pyramid in every 100 pips, not @ 90 pips.

again had I used 90 pips, your account would have gone sooner.

also your average price is getting higher the more you pyramid in.

with the 0.9200 and 0.9100 positions, your average price is indeed 50 pips away.

@ 0.8700 your average price has grown to 97 pips away from your last 0.8700 trade.

very risky system in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
and when was the last time you saw a hard fall of 500 pips without the needed retracement to jump off at BE (+/- 40 pips)???  and specialy when your first entry on trade is after a big fall, like I say in the Summary, enter when price is far far away of cloud/MA200 on 4h TF... ??

I have the answer to you, you didn´t see it, because this is forex, not some casino of Vegas...

My experience, that can happen on 300 pips, no more than that, and that is extreme!!

But you are free to have your opinion, and search a more profitable way of tradig

--- 帖子 #274 ---
in my opinion trading like this is like being in a casino in Vegas........

you cannot have these big profits without very high risk.

I wish everybody trading this system lots of luck.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I had already price on BE...expect something higher this time, but let´s see, perfect is to be able to put SL on BE, if price goes upper than that!

--- 帖子 #276 ---
maybe you are new to this market or something, but I´ll draw a paint to you:

In Vegas, the RED can appear 20 times in a row..

On Forex, price cannot drop more than 300 pips without the needed retracement...

Trading like this can be like being in a casino, but if you are playing a totally different game, which reacts in different way!!!where´s the connection? seeing the picture? you can take advantage on that way, if you want..

If you are concerned on risk, make your math and proportion and open LOT adjusted to your Risk Managment...

I wish to you more than luck, I wish you a plan!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
done, pyramid completed, new Balance High!!!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Xandi I have only to clap your system, it's amazing!

I read every page today, unfortunately my $103 account with a minimum of 0.01 lots aren't able to support the DD.

I will start test the Pyramide with a demo account.

Some doubits,

Are you using only the rules of the first topic? If yes you trade against the trend right?

But when I saw some of your trades you trade following the trend, what is the right way?

Thanks for share this and I wish you so much money.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
thanks bro!! welcome!!

you should find your equilibrium in Demo account, because as this system is nearly automated, means trading without emotion with pending orders, there´s no such difference between Live or Demo.

I´m using the Strateggye summary, with some details you can find on some pages, like that one of finding the reinforcement 100 pips below neckline, as I showed this night, why I had the pending buy at 9040!

If some pair dropped a lot lot of pips and it´s now faraway from cloud or  MA200, specialy on 4hTF, less (but) relevat on daily TF, I start to think in only long that pair...ON Focm I switched to following the trend even being oversold because I know how the event works...but in other situation is always buy with TP 50 pips, if achieved, wait some drop of 30/50/70 pips and buy again, and so on so on until price reach cloud on 4hTF...

I will detail even more the summary these days! any doubt ask, and make your risk calculation to find your Pyramid equilibrium and balance..

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I was watching this thread for a few weeks. I feel this system is more like Roller Coaster than Pyramid

--- 帖子 #284 ---
It seems you missing points here on thread...Ohh, I get it, you mean it´s like a roller coast, but without the loop!!! ok...

Hi Xandi,

Appreciate if you could review the period from May 1 to end of May when there was a huge sustained drop for AUD. The price was also "far away" from cloud since about May 10 to end of May.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #287 ---
No bro, first of all, in that period price were above than ICH cloud on 4hTF and higher TF, so I would never long that pair...

that´s the 1st condition on the strategye, you cannot make the opposite!!

and by the way, even on that drop huge, you have to search on 15minute Time frame of that period to have sure that price never did the needed retrace to jump on BE...I may answer to you, price did it, after at lest 300 pips of direct fall...

ps: tonight I´ll answer to your question with chart! thanks

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Haha, roller coaster without any loop is boring!

I have few questions:

"Entry:
When price is far far away from Ich Cloud, or MA200, or equivalent, do open trade expecting aproach to them.
TP 30/50/70 pips -- LOOK ONLY on high Time frames to find this, above 4h TF --> Weekly"

Do you have exact pips of "far far away"? Are you using 9,26,52 ichimoku? Are you fully manual trade or using EA?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I´m using EA to build pyramid, to change TP automatically on all open positions when Pending orders are triggered, but I choose mannualy the TP and Lot size...the far far away pips I´ll try to explain by chart this asia session, now I´m tight with time!

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Interesting. I am looking forward your examples with charts. I am learning ichimoku since 2 weeks ago but it's not that easily to spot on trends.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
...and a very very special thanks to Gumrai, brilliant coder who made this beautiful EA!! thanks for making my dream possible!! we´re still improving, broo

--- 帖子 #301 ---
for those who asked, on those circles you had opportunity of more than 100 pips to jump off at BE  of course you need to follow other rules, that broken neckline...I will update Summary with that precious tip!!

--- 帖子 #302 ---
hey xandi!

Pyramide:

i have an open position @ 9145 + a pending order @9033

we have a 4h downtrend channel with doji on weekly ATM

6h 8h 12h timeframe points down on OANDA (disclaimer different 4h candle rollover... to MT4)

so i also use a shortterm short position SS @ 9144 TP/@9033 SL/@9182

all posted trades are real

--- 帖子 #303 ---
relax, even if was not, the principle is to share!!!! I might put other pending buy equal lot at 9100..and other 0.6 at 9040, i think...

and plusI like your analysis! being haapy you are joinning the pharao troop!!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
hey xandi,

i don´t like those explorers, they add some psycological pressure to me - daily goal / weekly goal

and i had serious troubles to close loosing trades early... its a "monk"

it improved my trading

--- 帖子 #306 ---
bro, in this strategye, this is not how it starts, not even the middle, but how it ends....you have no pressure on TE.

...but I respect!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
thank you! but i´ll try to post (when on screen) all entries / TP / SL that belongs to the pyramide system

--- 帖子 #308 ---
changing my next entry to 9094...

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Please explain why it's long instead of short? Because what I see is bearish on both 4h and daily charts.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
you can see that, but this strategye don´t see that at all...this is not related to Ichimoku trading or something, we trade on approach to Ich Cloud, so we can only be long this:

"Strategy Summary

Entry:
When price is far far away from Ichimoku Cloud, or equivalent (MA70), do open trade expecting aproach to them."

--- 帖子 #311 ---
hey xandi,

adjusted TPof the hedge and SL of the short position just above EMA50 on dayli ~92.05 that should fit with the ichimoku cloud.

in worst case i loose the spread, in best case the TP of my short triggers after reaching ichimoku...

we´ll see.

i´ll open a new account for pyramide with TE soon.

regards thodie

xandi, thanks for the explaination, I am getting the picture now. Is it SMA or EMA?

Do you avoid news time? For example, NFP announcement just now makes GU down further as I expected.

Hey xandi nice thread.

thanks bro, let´s see if I have to go on weekend with cement powder on hands, and back monday to continue the building!

ps: I´m 20 pips from BE...

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Xandi, don't worry about cement on hands during the weekend, I started today two pyramids. Both have at the moment two steps. One is on ucad and the second one on our favourite audusd  I only regret that I didn't closed my trades before datas from USA, but don't think about that too much. We will have another profitable pyramids

--- 帖子 #319 ---
heheheheheh!! bah , the market closed 9 pips below my TP...we are here for that, building pyramids, and with time, we will start profiting more in that occasions, not jumping off on BE but considerable 30 pips above (like you´ve been doing)...now, the sunday gap, it ´s like throwing coin in the air, and if goes down I´ve 8950 ready!! nice to hear you, enjoy your weekend bro!!

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hello xandi,

What you think about start a pyramid at EURUSD at sunday?

Its already 190 pips since the last significant retract and the pair is kicking at a support:
Attached Image

--- 帖子 #321 ---
yes!! that´s good logic!! but consider high probability that price drop more 100 pips, because cloud Ichmoki is still "drawing down", be prepared, that's pyramid!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
here are older EW counts from AUD/USD

maybe they are helpfull, as you can see price is curling around the .38 fibo for a while!

BTW: explorer is activated but actually no funds on this account

--- 帖子 #323 ---
good morning dear fellows!

another pyramid concluded with sucess, this time I should have kept my TPhigher, in order to profit as wanted...now I´m searching "100% all time" in less than 1 month, since this topic oppened, at 11th June!!!!

BTW: my pyramid is also done...

time to add some funds to the 3rd (pyramid) account

--- 帖子 #331 ---
"3rd pyramid" accounts?? you´ve tried already 2 pyramid accounts before??

...make your calculation on porportion basis well bro, if so, put here your leverage and balance and we achieve the lot size!   Also start entering only when Price is already on you IchCloud side(far away), and after price make a sharp falll, like past friday..in that situation, you start building pyramid with double confidence!!!! best tip I can´t give you!!

you must have "patience, understanding, love..most of all, you need love ★ "

--- 帖子 #332 ---
TheUltimateTradingSystem - search it on FF see what you think.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
WOW!!! Thanks a lot guys!!! All the brothers in one place, it is starting to remind me of the good old days......and Xandis pyramides!!!! Double party

--- 帖子 #334 ---
hey xandi,

the 3rd account is only for pyramid...

i was short last friday exit was a bit early throug trailing stop but the pyramid pending has triggered.

i have 50 leverage and use generally small start positions. So i won´t be able to make 100% a month without

max. risk.

usually 3 to 5% a month...

so pipa why don´t you stay for a while an help building pyramids

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I usually start position with 4:1 leverage.. my broker allow me 100:1...I didn´t risk much,  I was not even near of margin call once, so the risk for me was also reduced...the risk management was perfect, and now, I can make the only SL on this strategye, called withdraw!!!

ps: But thodie, how much margin you will have, moree sucessfull and relaxed will be the strategye..if you are pleased with 4% month, perfect bro!!!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thanks for sharing Xandi. I have learnt a new way of trading. Im planning to start trading again in a few weeks so i will definetley be using pyramids

--- 帖子 #337 ---

If anybody is interested in trading ucad, have a look at the daily graph. There is an evening star marked in a blue circle. Also we are far away from clouds, so I think it is a good oportunity to sell it. Even if it will not fall sharply we have our pyramid system

take note of the trades, almost all were LONG, in one month, even with price dropping, we can profit hard being coherent, having a plan and trading it, without exeption, and I really mean it, without emotion...It´s less enthusiastic, less adrenaline, but gives you consistent money, the propose of trading!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
hehehe..I was just writing about that!! it´s a bless we have found&developed it!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
ok, with reaction to falls like we saw on asia, and also because of farfar away quote from yesterday, TP above is even more possibly!

--- 帖子 #357 ---
new pending positions...it´s a pitty if none is triggered...with market finaly in our side,I change to this kind of pyramid

the TP of 1.2 and 0.9 are provisory, didn´t done the math until...

--- 帖子 #358 ---
hey xandi,

not at home ATM so can´t post the chart.

€/$ 4h looks like a clear buy...

Stochastic stack looks quite good.

Started pyramid with small position 1:1 today...

--- 帖子 #359 ---
1st pending buy was triggered and already hit TP... 75$ profit while I was meditating on yoga!!! lol

this is cruise trading ship!

--- 帖子 #360 ---
hi thodie!!go straight ahead , 1st pyramid started!!

1:1 levverage!! ok!! understood!! the best bro!

--- 帖子 #361 ---
My TP was 9180 and I use to trade like this, I´ve explained before, use Price action, look at my previous charts with that shadowed zone, use the SUp/Dem indi on 15min TF or 1hTF. I draw the line on body candles, not on wick/shadow...it´s explained on Price Action Julexo, and also some manual I put here also...

--- 帖子 #362 ---
just wondering this: why when you start the pyramid the target is to break even instead of using martingale?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I´m not familiarized with term/concept martingale, but my logic is this:

when price goes from the start on my side and hit TP, ìm happy.

when price goes from the start against me, I´m happy with => BE..So BE has to be assured, if price goes above BE, I can put a SL on BE and profit 20/30 pips or more with the all positions from pyramid...

ps: note that many time price only retrace to Breakeven..and the only thing matters is that your balance keep growing...

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Martingale is where u double after every losing trade.  Usually casino players play like that.  I think it might work well in the pyramids

--- 帖子 #365 ---
great... 2nd pos. 99pips below

but AUD/USD shows relative strenght!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
man, I showed you examples of my pyramids, and how they work perfect, and they are not that rigid of doubling thing, or something..theres´s rules like the "start counting after neck broken", and it can be:

0.3+0.3+0.6+1.2+2.4...

0.3+0.3+0.3+0.9+1.8+3.2...

etc..there´s various types, depending on situation, if we are on begginning of trend or not, if we are in FOCM or NFP, and other principles...

you shlud read careful the entire pages, and contextualize all the time posts with chart, start read post 1# and after jump to post 50# and read all examples in different sittuations, as important quotes!

ps: if martingale is that, it can also wright work even better here in this market than in casinos, because in casino the RED can appear 20 times in a row, on Forex price can´t drop more than 300 pips without the needed retracement to jump off on BE, I´ve explained here with examples many many of times!!!

--- 帖子 #367 ---
heehehe..great!!! and there you start your 1st pyramid!!!

I didn´t look to Eurusd, but I doubt that it is so good than AUDUSD respecting the far far away from ichcloud on 4h and daily TF...

Even so, let the pyramid work, drop down the TP of both positions to BE, and put already other pending position 90/100 pips below...you use the "counting after neck line broken" principle?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
My friend I am always here when I am at FF......but always for a limited time. I am not manual trading these days all my trading is with EA's.....

For me to start "building pyramids" witch I would honestly love to do it with you guys I need to learn the system the right way first and spend the time to give it a fair try.........maybe soon , it would be fun....

But I am here spying on you guys .....

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I am sure it will not take you much time to learn the system. It's quite easy, especially for advanced trader

--- 帖子 #370 ---
true!! and I like a lot how the "strategye summary" was developed here!! it can be even improved in minor details, but in my opinion, it´s already a great pocket trading mini-manual!!!!

--- 帖子 #371 ---
This summary is perfect to me. When we serve people to much information it is not good. The better situation is when somebody have this system as a frame and he works on details in his own way. I think so...  Of course we can share and I see we share our ideas, so we can learn each other and this is awesome here!

--- 帖子 #372 ---

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I´m testing crazy things on the edge...I´m desrespecting the "summary", especially on Lot entry, reinforcement gap, and IchCloud on 4hTF...

AUDUSD is already on cloud, so it might be not so good to entry long, but as I´m expecting 9260 when looking to daily, I´m all in on that, to see if catch bhoopalan with his leverage....

--- 帖子 #376 ---
i m new in this thread ....aud/usd is on the cloud , and gbp/usd is far away from the the cloud so i think it is good to build the pyramid ... what you guys think ?????

--- 帖子 #377 ---
good idea vimma,

my "pyramid" account is a GBP one, as i think GBP is a bit undervalued ATM compared to €.

i canged €/GPB @ 0.86120

--- 帖子 #378 ---
What is the amount of margin used for the 6 full lots in trade? Apparently you are using 1:200 ?

TF

--- 帖子 #379 ---
You can breathe a sigh of relief now.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
In my real live account I can choose between 1:100 or 1:300.. this Demo account I think it´s 1:200, but let me check at home, the margin required on 6 was 2000, I think..

--- 帖子 #381 ---
yes you are right ...

--- 帖子 #382 ---
bahh, stopped aggain on Breakeven...bro, we approeched the cloud on 4hTF, but we have a gap of 400 pips on daily to reach the cloud...because of that on 4htf, this will happen, but Im with more confidence that price will drop down less and will continue climbing up, so I can reduce the gap between my reinforcement...After a month, price finnaly is coming on our way!!!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
don´t forget to use the combination between "4h TF and daily TF"..you cannot only see in one of those, but if so, choose the daily

--- 帖子 #384 ---
9260 here we go! new balance high..

Thodie, where is your BE on your pyramid?? will you try to profit?? update us bro!!

--- 帖子 #385 ---
congrats ....

--- 帖子 #386 ---
back to deserved place:

--- 帖子 #387 ---
yeah yeah yeah  Congrats!!

Exit first position , new entry... + Pending

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I remember you start a pyramid on eurusd, closed it at => BE? suppose yes  all the matters is that at the end of the journey, your balance is more positive!!

closed all for now, if I had let flow my pyramid with large basis at 9150, how much I would have be winning..hmmm...it´s the future step, for now, I´m pleased with this type of jump off...and reentering later, as I did...

--- 帖子 #389 ---
oh yes, sorry €/$ was finished in the past days earlier as expected with  BE + 0,2% gain.

The news has taken out my starting position @ AUD/USD now reentry @.9090 Pending double size @.9040

--- 帖子 #390 ---
pyramid finished, started the next one, actually the 4th one!

sinnce yesterday I´m tolding you...9260 achieved, even more!!!

i wish i was trading this night...would be long, as you know

--- 帖子 #394 ---
80 trades in AudUSD till now,all them longs, not even a single short!! it´s called coherence, and also having a plan when price is going against you...that´s the difference!!!!

Hi xandi,

I'm glad you are doing well, and I don't wish you good luck as it appears that you have a plan and a plan is better than luck

................ Beware of the man with a plan  ......................

You are right, don't get distracted by other things or threads when you are doing right, instead continue to fine tune your system and find the holes where the risk is hidden and try to attenuate it. Any expense to remove risk is a good expense.

Good success to you !

Maybe one of these summers we could drink some beers near Portugal or Spain on your boat or mine , I'm from Spain . and no problem if you would like to invite all other Egyptians here

Anyway, I like your attitude and the way you present things and if you agree, I will add you to my buddy list.

See ya !

--- 帖子 #399 ---
ok thanks..

--- 帖子 #400 ---
bro, liked a lot to read your post!!! it´s full of assertive things, like the management risk and the fine tunning of the strategye!!! You are also in the right path bro, you concept are similar to mine, keep following and reading strategye summary, so we can share experience and possibles improvements!!

By the way, we have also much to talk about our EA money machine!!!

regarding the "magic reunion" together with Pharaonics here, it will happen, Spain or Portugal! I studied 1 year on erasmus Murcia(Granada (dé puta madre ) and I lovely enjoy the Almeria Coast (Cabo de Gata Natural Reserve) and Cadiz coast (Doñana and below)...

I´m from Porto, I live 1 hour from Galicia and I love to be there also for long journeys!! From Portugal, I have so much to show!!!

keep in touch compañero!

--- 帖子 #401 ---
hi Tomoney!!! how´re you doing bro?! I was thinking you´ve already gone rich with pyramids and left to Seychelles!

Everytime i see this pair below of what i´ve seen before, I long it, I can be at lunch, on party, driving, by night under bed sheet , If I seen it below, i buy it...

until daily approach IchCloud...

By the way, 4.000$ in one month, I can live with that...so I will not increase Lot size than this, and leverage will drop down as balance growths!

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hey xandi!  Seychelles... sounds good...  But can't afford it now  I must build more pyramids bro  Btw. I didn't post anything, because I built last pyramid two days ago. From this time every trade brought me profit without using Egyptian power  At the moment I am long on audusd and short on ucad. It's standard

--- 帖子 #403 ---
beautiful!!!after this golden egg chicken left we have to find another with same eggs!!

It´s the time when price is on our side, after being so far away on 4hTF+Daily, now when 4hTF approach, is when price is with strenght in our way!!!

by the way, I didn´t put the TP on the open positions, price already was above BE, and now dropped...hmmm, first time I didn´t follow the rule of change TP immediatly, and you see I miss the chance that price gave me (BE is 9173), now hope I can get away of it without injuries!!!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Few minutes ago my trade on ucad hit TP +30 pips

The other one on audusd did't go as positive. I started building pyramid  I have 0,03 lot long @ 92245 and 0,06 @ 91345. TP @ 91795. We will se how will it go

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Btw. have a look at audcad. It's far away from clouds on h4 and d1

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi, I read carefully the thread but I still do not correctly understand how do you update the TP when/while building the pyramid.

Could you post an example to make it more clear.

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
hmmm...you´re being lazy for sure!!! it´s described in many examples on these 17 pages...it´s fulcral you read it careful and contextualizing the examples with chart at that time...example asked:

you buy 0.2 at 9200, with TP 9250...

...price goes against you...

you buy 0.2 at 9100, you change the TP of both open position to -> (0.2*9200+0.2*9100)/(0.2+0.2)=9150

...price still goes against you, and TP is not hit...

you buy 0.4 at 9000, and change TP in all 3 position to -> (0.2*9200+0.2*9100+0.4*9000)/(0.2+0.2+0.4)=9075

cappisci

--- 帖子 #408 ---
hmmm, well english is not my primary language ... could be something I didn't catch ....

Anyway thanks a lot ...

--- 帖子 #409 ---
hehehe..I was joking abou lazy, but for sure it´s very importat read the pages trying to contextualize with charts at that period of time!! It´s a pleasure for me to help you and trying to explain better and better!

ps: I´ve put this example on Strategye Summary 1st page! thanks for advising

--- 帖子 #410 ---
no problem ... we are all here to learn new stuff to improve our way of trading ...

--- 帖子 #411 ---
if price goes above my BE=9173, after that occur I will put SL at BE...TP at least 9215...It can be very useful an EA who does this automatic..going to check that!

--- 帖子 #412 ---
I love this system!

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I love it too!!! you don´t get satisfied with BE! you are profiting right on the time of jumping off pyramid...

my pharaonic:

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Nice xandi, you earned more than $100  The best thing is that it don't consume our time. I was playing billard with my friends when I just opend app on my smartphone and saw that my trades hit TP  Any ideas now? Have you checked out audcad? What do you think?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
heheheee..happen the same to me, using pending orders, TP automatic, are definitly a revolution!!

Bro, audcad is similar to audusd...as opposite of usdcad!! I have some more trades long on audusd, when I see a sharp fall of 50 pips I will buy!! at home I will look to charts in all pairs, but aud still have room to still going up, until daily TF is at 100 pips from cloud... on that situation, I will think twice...

--- 帖子 #416 ---
going long again

--- 帖子 #417 ---
missed..my smartphone run out battery, and I don´t have mt4 on this pc...

the entry was easy, price was mooving slow, on small interval, so here a fast drop of 20 pips it´s sufficient to pull the entry trigger...

--- 帖子 #418 ---
You're right  It can be treated like an alternative for bored with audusd

--- 帖子 #419 ---
you right, this system is boring!!! I want to trade with adrenaline, emotion, euphoria, more than I want to earn money...majority of FF users, even they don´t realize! been there, done that!

well, going home, if I see this near 9150 I will first entry, not too leveregge this time, possible tricky times since 4htf is already on cloud, I´m expecting other 100 pips up and there the torment will start...

--- 帖子 #420 ---
BORING!!! You got my attention now.....if it is boring I will try it out...

I will start reading the tread on the weekend and Monday I will become a "Brother Egyptian"....

looks like it could be general a switch to buy the dips on AUD/USD...!

Nice pipa! It´s both simple an effective!

Xandi i don´t know, are you totally crazy or a genius...

Had a few small trades this week: Margin used not more than 5%

actually 4% balance gain...

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Once I forgot about one of trades, because it hit TP and went to history. The only thing which reminded me about it was my pending order prepared to build pyramid  If it is thats way of being bored I like it

--- 帖子 #426 ---
nice first steps, baby!!

"it could be general a switch to buy the dips on AUD/USD" ---> I´ve been doing that the all month, and once price still far away from cloud, I will still keep longing&longing in every sharp drop!!!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
yeah  4% a week over 52weeks or more...

but as written maring used less than 5% i´ll slowly increase the size of next pyramids...

--- 帖子 #428 ---
hehe, i know but i sell the peaks in the last weeks

--- 帖子 #429 ---
thodie, do you did 1+1=2 on your entry 9174? the leveragge seems the same, but indeed you can try flexible pyramid as better fits you, and maybe start doucling after -200 pips  yes, go find the pyramid who suits you, on different moments and distances of aproaching cloud..

--- 帖子 #430 ---
you were selling this pair in different strategye..in this one you could only be longing...or better, you can pyramidate this pair doing shorts, but in my opinion, you are increasing risk, playing with risk....the Entry Rule is fulcral to reduce risk...

--- 帖子 #431 ---
still 400 pips far way from cloud on daily...

800 pips far awayon weekly...

...the price is prepared for pass by to upperside on 4hTF, and trend for 100/200 pips on long...

--- 帖子 #432 ---
lilbit confuse please clear it..... if i sell and prize goes against me and after 100 pips i make another position and still prize is against me now i double my lot on another position .... and if now i there is a bounce back and prize come to my side    .... what (how many pips) should be the minimum take profit ????

--- 帖子 #433 ---
you have example on strategye summary...you can jump off at BE, or > BE...that´s up to you, the fundamental is to assure the BE, if you catch more 10 pips, with large basis pyramid, you profit hard!

it´s simple, you have to make ponderation math (example on 1st page) to find the BE..simple

--- 帖子 #434 ---
nice &  simple system bro!!

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Too bad we cant add music to the thread. "Walk like an egyptian" by the Bangles would be ideal!!

--- 帖子 #436 ---
thanks you very much .. now i wish to apply pyramid on my real account...

--- 帖子 #437 ---
even in the tough conditions, pyramid is always there to give us an hand!!! the other traders don´t have it, so they fall more...

conclusion to this last pyramid, price on audusd still moving on 50 pips gap/interval...I reenter only 10 pips gap on the last position, and it could be run wrongly...I should have only renter at 9000 with 2Lot, replacing the last 2 entrys

--- 帖子 #438 ---
the effect would have been the same, with less risk:

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I would say your last few pyramids were impulsive.  Why do you need to do so? This cannot be an integral part of a system which can be termed as "tension free". Do you also need to take such decisions in your live account?

TF

--- 帖子 #440 ---
let me clarify you...the system is writen and summarized on 1st page, you have there the Strategye Summary, and it´s 100% tension free, as it easily observed since is all pending orders, automatic TP...Once you have made your analysis and choose entrys, you become on "cruise mode", with EA working on changing TP´s....

As I told you before (you seem to forget that), I need to test it sometimes to the edge, in order to improve and take my own conclusions, and so I can fine tunning the strategye summary on 1st page!

"last few pyramids were impulsive"..you are refering to the only both pyramid you commented here..I´ve done it much much more, and following rules strictly...basically, I´ve margin for 5/6 reinforcements, depends on gap/interval of reinforcement, and I´m calculating the Lot entry size to assure always those number of reinforcement if it´s needed....

By the way, I´d like to see you here posting more often, sharing your opinion and thought, and not only when things get tighted up!you can be part and make this system even better, and maybe you read better the dynamic of the thread!!

--- 帖子 #441 ---

made some mistakes today, with my entries and get the bill immediately...

1. pip distance between the positions to small

4. impatience

Conclusion learned my lesson!

--- 帖子 #445 ---
i´m going to check your trades, but for start, I don´t reccomend trading equal currencies, like eurgbp, in this method...you know why?? because that type of pairs have no retracement, really, they can be all the week in the same price, and after jump 100 pips and stop there...I never seen this strategye used on equal curriencies like eurgbp, euraud, eurchf, audnzd, even usdcad I don´t like...

use it on eurusd, audusd, eurjpy, usdchf, usdjpy...

I update the summary with this information....why you guys try allways to be different??? audusd in not good enough??

have a nice weekend, we will recover that when you change the name of your TE

ps:I read your update post, and I ask to you:

where´s your pending orders and tp automatic? try the EA, will be very useful...

but serious, the mistake was the pair you choose to pyramid!

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hey Xandi,

EUR/GPB is only the exchange rate where i switched from € to Pound as this is a GBP Account.

The last trades where on AUD/USD. As i said many mistakes and i know it...

not proud about that

ahhhhhh.ok!! even so I updated it on summary...pending orders my friend, today I had 3 triggered, mannualy I wouldn´t have it, you know why?? emotion!!!

i changed some of my entries manually...

--- 帖子 #449 ---
bro, belive me, if you are starting this method, try it on Demo or use Micro Lots, in order to you to test it, and to get confidence on it!! and you test more, and you let the the saara spirit flow like the wind...

ps: you are using the right leverage, i´ve just looked at your TE.

Thodie, only now I realize you didn´t close the positions!!i went check you TE, and that´s perfect, it´s pyramid! the only thing its really important is Leverage and balance, equilibrium! Yours have it! and also jumping off on BE automatically, or using EA...didn´t you had chance for that?

As egyption bro said: "Theres no problem going with cement on hands during weekend! Just keep building and jump at BE."

sorry for the confusion, Monday you are in profit!!sometimes im too high, specially on friday night!!!

ps: lot proportion:

you used 1;2;2;3;7

I usually use 1;1;2;4;8

Yeah.

I just finished reading the thread with the important posts. I am interested in your pyramid trade management. Not going to talk about how it perform, because i know how it is and you have mentioned it in post 1. What i am trying to know is where/what kind of scenario do you apply this method? I know that if one system cannot provide a good signal to activate and deactivate the trade management, then the risk of blowing one account is higher.

Add: You have clearly mentioned in post 1 for where do open trade. What i mean here is how you manage your subsequent pyramid with price action(Not the math calculation). You are buying the reinforce/counter trend, but how valid is the reinforce? So your pyramid has the potential for not to keep open position until no ending.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
reinforcements with price action is optional...you can see I wrote 2 points...use the first one, 90/100 pips after you find neckline(read summary about it) on 1h tf!

"So your pyramid has the potential for not to keep open position until no ending."...No bro, you have experience on forex? (I´ve posted many times...)jumping off at breakeven you catch that no more than a week!300/400 pips maximum, 4/5 reinforcement...it´s the price nature, as some other user said!

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Ops...i overlook that.  I thought the distant between previous and next position is less than 100 pips. So this is a 100% winning system.

One question, what would be the minimum of fund for this case in order to earn x return per period? What is your thought?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
nice thread

--- 帖子 #471 ---
agreed! i suscribed awhile ago and check it 2 or 3 times a day!

--- 帖子 #472 ---
"i went check you TE, and that´s perfect, it´s pyramid"...by your logic, you miss the entry at 9015 or near below with the sum of your leverage, 15 Lot...it makes all the difference, as I´ve been saying, if you use this rules, you can jump at BE no more than after sharp fall...now, it´s like you starting th pyramid again, price already gave you the opportunity to close but you were not there

undrestand, but you gan´t give up at pyramid on middle, special in sharp sharp falls

...I´ll be here at night to trade wit you!

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Thank you xandi!

That was some circumstances which wasn´t optima on friday

see you later

--- 帖子 #474 ---
hehehe!!!you only miss that order, so next time use pending, even if is a hurricane near you!!!hehehehe

So now you have to re-balance your pyramid if price still go against you...I don´t know your Levverage limit, but at this point,and if it is 100:1, better you make your entry near 8970 or 9000, and other at 8870/9000...price probably will go again to 9030 and react with strenth to upside..let´s see how price react, you can also entry at 9030...we will wait!

--- 帖子 #475 ---
There is still headroom for 2 additional positions.

Actual Margin used14%

Max: 50%

Margincall at 100%

--- 帖子 #476 ---
the waters start to be agitated on bottom...probably because we are talking of a bottom!!!nice view to start another pyramid on my bullish sentiment for audusd for this week!

I´m looking 9040..

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hello everyone here! Let's start another profitable week

--- 帖子 #478 ---
let ´s praise chanting the texts of pyramid!

--- 帖子 #479 ---
so, I went long...my idea is to reinforce the same lot at 9040...or TP hit...

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I have two pyramids, both two step at the moment. One on audusd and the second one on audcad, so I am waiting for closing in profit

--- 帖子 #481 ---
H1 and H4 on the AUD are out of sync........

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Entering the AUDUSD piramid with a toy account of $5, starting with $0.005/pip TP at 0.9123

Lets try that with Xandi.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
i tried to enter too. It worked out but not sure if I did the settings right. It opened 5 orders at the same time. Can you please share your sample settings for this ea in this instance so I can get confidence in the settings.

I tried entering a buy stop 5 pips above market, but I think this is not right. i must have a prior buy order above which didn't go my way. Then I put some settings into the ea. Sample would be awesome if someone would be so kind.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
good morning egyptian followers!! thankss for your enthusiasm!

Thodie, how´s your pramid?? very near to BE, already jumped off??

Whil I was sleeping, I catched more 30 pips, 100$, as you could see...

minute, what EA ae you using??

now I´m using this...going to explain:

you have to open position and set pending TP.

after you use EA, and relate the pending orders to the existing one...after EA is created you can cange the TP on all pending, it will work..for example if you want TP will drop 50 pips every pending is triggered(step) :

ps: read post#23 on http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=432927&page=2

--- 帖子 #485 ---
ok, it was near but not enough...of course dispite the circunstances, yesterday we should have oppened trade and balance your pyramid with entry at 9070...let´s expect the best!
http://blog.anarebelato.com.br/wp-co...olho-grego.jpg

--- 帖子 #486 ---
first I oppened long, with TP 9130...look how I set EA now...and after I can change the Entrys Price and the TP (correctly to BE), when the pending is triggered, all the TP on OpenPosition are changed!

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi Xandi, thank you for your detailed explanation. I'll go thru it. Im using Gumrai's EA latest version. Looks like the same one in your example.

Love this thread.

Think I get it now. Will practise again!@

--- 帖子 #488 ---
it should look like this...

now you have to do your math and find breakeven for every entry so you can change TP if activated on pending. basic!

ps:note that when pending ordr is triggered, all the TP in all open positions are changed to the TP of that pnding order triggered...that what the EA does!! besides oter things...

--- 帖子 #489 ---
hey xandi,

i exit the base position with ~27pips as i saw price would not make it above 4h EMA50 now. The pyramid was near BE.

i have pendings lower @90.52/ 90.05

regards Thodie

Edit: Xandi, actually i use no EA, but i download your´s and try it on demo first just to get sure all options are correct...

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I see now. So it's important that we chose the right level, where a likey like retrace occurs or will occur in that zone.

In this case the pyramid starts 150 pips down with 5 levels with a new take profit every 50 pips geared to the lot size.

So you are straight away going into the pyramid here or do you only use for recovery? Or sometimes straight away and sometimes recovery.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Xandi correct me if I'm wrong,

I entered buying AUDUSD at 9096 with 0.0005

My first reinforce is at 8996

So if me reinforce is trigged I must change my take profit to:

(0.0005*9096+0.0005*8996)/(0.0005+0.0005) = 9046

Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
no, it´s not important because you can change after EA is working you can change the entry prices on every Pending!

flexibility bro!!!!

!I´m refering to the First entry..the reinforcement or you use standard or have skills to find Demand on PA.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
exactly!!

--- 帖子 #494 ---
ok, it can be worst!!in your situation I only might jump off also because the equilibrium of pyramid was ruinned, since it was missing the entry near 9000/9050...and price gave 2/3 chances to be at BE, if Pyramid was balanced...

I noticed your account does not allow much leverage, what is the maximum 30:1 or 50:1 ? you were not cosy with it....In that cases starting with 1:1 it´s not the same...

try the pattern 1;1;2;4;8;16 on reinforcements ... it´s more cofortable!

--- 帖子 #495 ---
In my opinion, you have to do your math in order to hold a dropdown MAXIMUM of 300 pips without retracement...using you gaps/reinf of 50 pips or 100 pips, do your math deeply, and after choose the 1st entry lot size..

if I can hold 5/6 reinforcements I feel safe

better you test it on demo or something until you find your Proportion

--- 帖子 #496 ---
you are right, when i look on the pyramid the mistakes began with first position because this position was near the cloud!

overall sentiment was tooo bullish.

Edit: Pending hit!

actual margin level 14%

TP moved to BE =9114

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Ohhh I seee..you closed your basis position in profit and reentered again lower the basis!!!! smart, you are balance things again

ps: when do you say max leverage=50%, it means the maximum you can achieve with your open positions is 50:1 ? now you are at 14:1...correct? that´s the first margin call, or it´s the point that your broker close your positions?

--- 帖子 #498 ---
exactly, position was +27 3minutes to 4h candle close and direct below the EMA50 so i decidet do exit and entry lower. It worked...

50% means i cannot open further positions; 100% is the margin call.

But If the account stays longer than 5 working days above 50% Oanda will close all open trades, no matter if 50.1% or 88%

--- 帖子 #499 ---
let´s see how react now!!!

--- 帖子 #500 ---
And it reacts like charm!!! Having an Eagly Eye to find Demand/Supply will help you...this one was basic, and we will see soon 91xx again...

--- 帖子 #501 ---
and repeat, exit base position +25pip and exit top position -183pip giving (0.1% balance +) as i don´t like 5min and 15min chart.

but now looks like i was wrong...

new Pending @9050

some sort of exit strategy...

--- 帖子 #502 ---
no bro, you are driving sideways of pyramid like that...you are mixing 2 trading styles, and disrespecting rules of strategy summary...

imagine if this time price break up with strenght and you have jumped off < BE? this strategye it´s much more simply than what you are using, you can use price action only to find reinforcement zone, and you must jump off => BE

you need to get deep confidence in the system, it´s noticed, sometimes you are half in/half out!!!

the first time you did it this morning, was smart, because it was 1st time price touched resistance...this time it might not be smart...let´s see

--- 帖子 #503 ---
here you go!!! nice you work you done bro!! the pyramid is merciless!!!..well, next time will be better!!! you know it now!

--- 帖子 #504 ---
yes! thats not pyramid im aware of that.

I saw Priceaction1 with 100:1 positions oppened, and 315% profit this morning...I saw fxbick in the same situation....mine was at 10:1...bad luck I have no possibility to trade until Asia...

with high leverage from the TOP, easy come, easy go!!! cheers competition bro´s!!!!

--- 帖子 #507 ---
eyes it is "test2" so testing is going with different set up and ideas.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
yah bro, I know, I´ve just take the opportunity to remind all the viewers that with high leverage from the TOP(1st entry), and without disciplinated plan, they can achieve high profit several in a row, and after in one trade blow everything up!! been there, so that I took the chance to advice!

ps: it´s easy to see you have talent and skills trading PriceAction, and it´s nice you´re testing it up, you´re doing right, so you can put together that talent in some sort of strategye plan!

--- 帖子 #509 ---
yes true as you can see my first demo once it hit about 1800% but within no time it come to 200-300% and now it is about 450% no trade in it (I just forget the login info LOL)

--- 帖子 #510 ---
hoppefully in 1 hour I have already battery to open my pyramid...

anyone thinks 9040 will not hold the sustained move to north??

--- 帖子 #511 ---

God, AUDUSD went to 8998 and my order at 8996 has not activated.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
You had a normal pending order or pending which aim was to reinforce some opened trade - build pyramid?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
use less 2 pips next time

if you tunned to the moves in this pair, I may enter mannualy for 5 pips I wold say!!!if I´m online looking at, and by my own, it´s out of God´s speeches!

6 weeks only longing AudUsd = top Rank Profit ! can you believe it ?!?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
That was my first bro, closed with +2 at 9098

Early I'm not able to piramidate because my toy account was not credited.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I just believe, because I'm in here  Good system, high return = top place in the rank

As you can see when I started to post my tickets here you could see 0.01 lot as a first trade and next in case of pyramid 0.02 and so on. Now after this time me account gave me something about 100% return and I start with 0.02

--- 帖子 #520 ---
arrange that!! you will be the one who profits!

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Doesn't matter, closed in profit is always good. You will soon recognize this system as your favourite if you only want to bulid pyramids as it is written on strategy summary

The least that I could say is that my EU trading and returns are pathetic comparing to yours   but anyway I'm happy and have to go to the end of my journey before deviating from it and becoming another pyramid builder. So no other words to say than rinse, repeat and continue.

I will often be there spying on you guys, so be good and do well,

Good morning brothers!! I´m with a terrible hangover this morning...mamma mia!!slept out, I had again no battery to reenter long this asia session, at least I was partying all night...now at work ruinned!

so, I didn´t like to miss the train, since I was expecting this last night, I posted on Audusd thread & here it will blow up, and it did...

SO conclusions folks, of these weeks longing AUDUSD!!!!!!:

This is/was the type of movement we want to catch in the future, in any pair we choose(on that list)

The price was far far away on 4htf and daily TF combined from Ich cloud, and that´s it´s unique for our trading...after that, we start longing expecting first the 4htf aproach, and after be on cloud, we expect some volatility (*) , high profitable pyramids, and price climbs above Cloud on 4hTF, which tell us that we may expect again big move long in order to aproach also the daily TF to Cloud...

(*) on this stage, we buy the dip, every sharp fall of 30/50/70 pips is bought from us!

this is what happenned on these 6 weeks, and we must save this pattern and movement to catch again in the future in other pair...

now, we will continue to see price goying hungry upside, maybe to 9450 (cloud on daily), and there, we will see again huge volatility as we seen on 4hTF, but this time worst, because it´s on daily...

expect you understood this swing, in order to catch it better next time, with all the surfing...the smart solution was to hold position yesterday night with SL at BE and TP oo...

I start the week writing price will drop maximum at 9040, I draw here the Horizontal line on that price, explaining why was the really Demand Line, and why it was the bottom (when waters start to be agitated on bottom), I´ve asked who think it will not hold, and on the end, it work´s perfect...I took my notes, I´m writing down all the move we´ve presented these fabulous weeks...

--- 帖子 #533 ---
beautiful post!!! I´m tempted!!!fun to see you left the building without injuries, your pyramid had the basis on quicksand, but you jump off from the roof!!!

beautiful, and congrats by your 1st pyramid!!!!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
it might be difficult to pass today this price 9230...like you suppose to know how to draw at this time, the lines on body candles, like I did at 9040, you can see on daily TF our Supply line is at 9230

--- 帖子 #535 ---
looks like a diamond reversal pattern to me...

especially on 4h

--- 帖子 #536 ---
that´s mean bull? I don´t read those patterns anymore, once you know what to do, only try to find Demand(for reinforcement) and Supply(for TP) line as described above..since we are in extreme bullish moment, this is the time we catch hard, as told before, finnaly price is on our side, after that 1 month swing, we have to take it..next target 9300

--- 帖子 #537 ---
a diamond is a reversal pattern see chart below!

a small one red and (maybe) the bigger one orange.

we could see one more downmove, but as always in trading nothing is for sure

Edit: the total height of the diamond is usually the range reached during the breakout! So if this monster triggers we should see round about 97...

but that can last until end of juli

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I think I´m going to stop here...price will go to 9260 at least, but can be  whiped out there today..this time I entered on double size because all of I´ve written today..was pretty clear we were on extreme bullish day, and maybe week!

--- 帖子 #539 ---
hmmm..not really...

Hi Xandi,

i didnt know u open thread here for au. im gonna follow this thread now. and hope can make profit from au.

ohhh...noo?? been here for a whole month, posting everyday while developing Strateggy Summary!! This is not AudUsd specific, it´s any tradable pair on list, but yes, I´ve been trading only AUDUSD because its conditions were unique...

--- 帖子 #542 ---
hey broketrader, thanks for your nice words...you are achieving great on EurUsd too!! as I said to you early, you are on right path, you know the plan and how to trade it, and you are and will be positive for sure, ever!

--- 帖子 #543 ---
oki dokie!

so, what do u think of au? im thinking of quitting ej since latelt its only gave me nothing but headache.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I´ve been longing 6 weeks in a row AU, so I might say you coming a little later on this pair...but read careful and every point of Summary Strategye, and when this AUDUSD finishes, we will find another pair which combine our requirement to trade.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
finnallyy, some fresh air to breath

--- 帖子 #546 ---
wowow and the price rise, open a small position 0,5:1 Leverage seems price won´t stop here, and with the last rise you can throw the diamond pattern into the recycle bin...

@Xandi your equity curve is frightening! it´s exponential  my deep respect for that!

--- 帖子 #547 ---
love your words bro, thanks ★ we are grateful to the Desert spirit ★

regarding price, still having difficult to end the day above the LINE (black), so...I don´t know if will play us some trick and close today below 9200 again, and on asia broke up definitly that supply LINE..it´s not being easy, let´s watch careful...

ps: I´m reducing leveragge at this stage...3:1

--- 帖子 #551 ---
ok folks!! no-one laugh about jokes...it´s a pitty, oh well...

let´s trade...

you know guys, we´ve been talking and today I wrote an important post describing the move we have just seen on audusd this month...and realizing that, we know the requirements to find other pair to trade, since this one soon will start to be more risky, but even tradable with sucess, of course...we will keep taking note what is going to happen when price reach the cloud on dailytf...

So, after a quick search, I find this pair which have the same conditions of audusd when we started to trade it...but the market is different and I never trade it..and worst, in 2 weeks is august and price has tendecy to go up with hurricanes in states..so I don´t know if I´m going to start pyramid also on this..maybe...this time short!

ps: more interaction bro´s!!!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
on other hand, audusd will probably draw this characteristical move on forex!! the most common and the most seen...and 9050 will hold...so there´s margin for another 100 pips up...

going to sleep..be active

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hi Xandi, couple of questions if you don't mind.

1. How do you decide take profit original 30/50/70, is this from SD zones above below?

2. How do you pyramidate and make profit when you jump off? I understood it was to get to BE.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
hello minute..questions:

1. I can decide TP on Supply/resistance lines(if long)...or I can put it automatic, it´s irrelevant, depends on your mood

2. I rarely make profit when pyramidate, I more focused in jump off at BE...but you can profit in that situation also, if price go above BE, you can put immediatly SL at BE, and let the profit run free...and in that situation 20/30 pips have much more return!

--- 帖子 #558 ---
today I´m not trading, I have no battery on phone again, and don´t have mt4 where I am...I will miss the last climb up of 100 pips advised yesterday...that´s no worries, yesterday I´ve posted my analysys with charts, describing the all move, and haven´t received feedback..so...

--- 帖子 #559 ---
hey xandi,

thats the reason why i use both MT4 and Oanda i can log in everywhere to adjust. MT4 is only on the Trading desktop.

realized pyramid entry... and shifted the pendings.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hello Xandi!

First time post. Just wanted to say thank you for reviving this thread. You have helped me find the missing piece of my trading. I have pyramidated two times now, and thankfully BE instead of taking losses on both. This could take my trading to the next level.

So Thank you, and please keep your positive attitude. I enjoy reading your posts and learning from this thread.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
thank for your words!! thanks for taking the step to post, that´s rewardable for me, because being many times here without receiving feedback, it´s not so funny...of course I am grateful for those who are keep following and supporting, but comparing the views received with members posting,I expect more from them who are not posting here...

Regarding the strategy, I´m pleased you understood the most important thing this is about...it´s how to handle with negative trades...it´s a whole new world...now you have a plan how to handle and recover your negative trades!! having like a robot machine behind you to deal when you are in trouble is Revolution..★

--- 帖子 #562 ---
trendline in charge...

downswing should be smaller than first time. Retest of the descending TL?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
no doubt you are NO 1 and your system is truly working! but I don't know why I use all my skills to do this! may be I act as a pace runner for you.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
...nooooooo!!!! I was starting to be relaxed, with you a couples of miles behind, and...bip bip!!! vrrrruuuumm.....

well,  I´m already preparing another trap to you

--- 帖子 #565 ---
ok good, now come to the trading as I am not using any indecator/EA only candlestick did 69 EMA have any special thing as you use it as a key point to enter in a trade( i.e when price is fair away from 69 EMA) I notice a  thing when price move very large in short time in any direction it goes back fast, when price move slowly in one direction is goes and goes did you or some one figure out the relation of time and price ratio of diffrent currency pairs. it should be a EA that can be work on price move and time. opss english is NOT my native language so may be I can't express  idea

--- 帖子 #566 ---
yap, i have the same opinion regarding the moves you described, as you described when price mooves very fast, for example sharp fall, it will be far far away from MA69....if price come down slow, the MA69 will follow it , so price never be far away from it...so we entry on the first scenary, counter trading..

I use cloud instead of MA69.

But bro, this is only the principle for us to start trading, because regarding all I´ve seen on forex, there´s less risk starting building pyramids on really  bottoms in those combined circunstances of being 4htf and mainly daily&weekly far far away from cloud (many pairs above 400 pips)...

this is only risk management, tring to avoid movements of 500 pips in a row without the needed retracement of  +/- 50/70 pips, in order to be able to jump off on BE...

--- 帖子 #567 ---
your diamond stil valid, as the W formation I posted yesterday on weekly...this night I´ll reply to you better, with charts & time!

--- 帖子 #568 ---
[10]invisible doesn´t post that much... they are hiding

--- 帖子 #569 ---
heyy broo!!!after reviweng charts, I still pointing on the picture below, so it´s promised another 100 pips up, before the bottom retest... W formation!

saw also your pyramid pending orders, seems good, I will enter some similar...even I can´t see your lot, but I´m going to 1;1;2 .. so I bought 1 lot at 9240, and pending 1 lot at 9210 and 2 lot at 9175...the lot size are example, it´s the proportion that matters...

--- 帖子 #570 ---
AUD/USD showed this behavior in the past, so why not in the future!

Lotsize compared to Balance is 2:2 as i don´t expect a big downswing, selles seems exausted => wicks on 4h

the descending TL should be a good ground ATM

And i like those weekly candles as well.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
when I say 1;1;2 it´s the pattern of reinforcement, not the leverage..

I will use 1-1-2-4-8

this time what you will use? I´m using EA, speccially if you building pyramid on 50 pips interval/gap...there you need a reracement of 20 pips to BE, so you must be fast, and EA (the final version) is highly reccomended...

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #573 ---
same here!

--- 帖子 #574 ---
by asked by many familyes, this time I will not close Pyramid at Breakeven...I´ll try  to profit 20 pips...(I had chance already to close at BE)...

today we will revival where to insert the most important reinforcement, 100 pips below the broken neckline, like occured this morning...

--- 帖子 #575 ---
when you combine the best of 2 worlds, you have to catch it (the 2nd reforce on the same spot with very careful and SL)...price at 9150 was 100 pips below of the broken neckline occured at London open... price return on the NY open to the Demand line created UK open (you should be able to draw it at this stage) after I will post again the Neckline example...

--- 帖子 #576 ---
ok, price wanted to get those missing pips to the Demand line and to the lowest point of the wick/shadow...SL smart should be just below the wick by 5 pips, in one position that´s umbalancing the pyramid proportion 1-1-2-4...now its 1-1-4 .... if things went wrong I´ll close that last position to get 1-1-2...

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hi Xan.. how r u today?

any suggest for au? im so struggling for this month

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hey xandi,

look at USD/JPY it is bilding a wedge! and got a very high correlation with AUD/USD.

and that fits pretty good to your W View from yesterday!

Pendings in Place.

don´t know...It´s only 100 pips from the cloud on 4htf and on daily tf..It´s out of the 1st condition of strategye, but of course you can build pyramids there with sucess, but maybe with more risk...

hey Mahasti!!like I said to you, you are arriving 1 month later to Audusd, but it´s still room for 200 pips up next days..what strategye are you using??

--- 帖子 #580 ---
last day was stress full. today I know the price will visit 1.3080 area and I put buy at 1.3080 area when price was 1.3111-07 area but did not short it WHY I am asking my self WHY I can't short eur/usd when price action is indicate  that move. only trade for some % gain to go above pumpkin59!!!

200 pips for up or down? i only use ichi and fibo. but tbh, most of it i only saw candle

--- 帖子 #583 ---
i´m telling up, but I only use pyramid!!! I´m embrassed by the egypcian power!!!

--- 帖子 #584 ---
yes i read ur first page. my question is, how u determine ur sl?

--- 帖子 #585 ---
how I can xandi!!!! you are at top because you play like a master. and it is the way to do trading NOT AS I DID. and I just see the daily chart of aud/usd. what else we need, we are at down move price stop going down from 90** area volumes are high so this the where long position can be bullied. you are doing so good I will enter long as per my price action. for 9758 area.  http://charts.mql5.com/2/67/audusd-d1-forextime-ltd.png

excelent analysis and symplified view..so assertive!!simple as the market is!

--- 帖子 #587 ---
By the way, where are you, disciple Tomoney, and your spiritual pyramids?

miss to see some pharao´s buildings...

today I could had close my pyramid at 9185, it was perfectly at BE, but I was greedy this time..but the context, the swing, and the view is on my side to start build longs on pyramid, like Priceaction1 described above! so, relax

--- 帖子 #588 ---
as the market is!!! LOL  but yes I think if we play safe in this area of aud/usd we can some thing from it.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
you have the right experience of the market...previous you described those spikes vs slow mooves and the consequences...exactly as I seen it.

Now you described simply how to form a bottom with volume...I spoke the same on Sunday when mentioned that "waters start to seem agitated on bottom", and that was precisily because being a bottom!

my strategye is also simple, even if I mix sometimes Priceaction, as you do, it´s still simply...

I can only tell you I´m not fan of complex views of the market, with complex technical and mixing all up! Elliot waves with harmonic patterns with butterflys garlet mixed up with priceaction, divergence and so on...

I´m much more a fan of having a coherent simply consistent strategye...

--- 帖子 #590 ---
me too 100% with you. I am going to see eur/jpy and aud/usd. for live trading.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi Xandi,

Your strategy looks very promising. Do you have latest code of the EA?

I find on Gumrai's thread but there's only the old version.

I've just started practicing Pyramid.

Just buy AUDUSD @  0.915, TP = 50

Hope me luck

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hi xixi!! welcomee to the sands of Sahara!!!

the latest EA from Gumrai I still didn´t tested, but minute tested it and it´s working smooth!!!

I use the second version, there are 3, on my 1st post I have 2 versions...

on the thread they are there! please thanks to Gumrai

SL? read careful the strategy..after reading and imagining the scenario, do you find space to insert SL?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi xandi! I am here and everything is ok with me  On Thuesday I defended my thesis on University (got best mark)   I wanted to rest a bit in silence, because last time was nervous. At the moment I have opened 4 trades and as you now me it means two pyramids  One on audusd as usual and the second on audnzd just for fun

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Btw xandi I like that you decided to close pyramid with profit. I always had two step pyramids and what you could saw on my tickets they were never closed on BE but in a profit, smaller or bigger but profit  Often when I closed it the price went more in my way.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
congratulations friend!!! that´s important mark!!!

you were nervous last time? maybe also because the thesis!!! you know our path, "trade without emotion"...the summary is there, I´m studying many details, until now, noone is better than the Strategy already written...

the only thing I find important is " after the moove start(or break line), count 90/100 pips to the reinforcement...

look the example today at UK:

have a nice relaxation now bro, and celebrate

--- 帖子 #597 ---
I know that...but today for example I could have already closed it...now, I´m risking another step on pyramid, 100 pips below ..

And don´t forget that I use to close on BE all the building, but immediatly in few minutes I start another(first brick)...persistent trading!

the original idea was to close every time the position with TP 50 pips, being the first brick or solid pyramid...after we will talk eachother and compare our pyramids too see if is more profitable that way, without more risk involved

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I was thinking about my thesis when I wrote "nervous"  Pyramid system is totaly emotion free as you said  No problem with this

About closing trades on BE or profit you are right. The difference is made by risk and profits which are a bit hard to compare and count because they work in different conditions when one is closed and the second can lead to open another pyramid step.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
finished my pyramid as visible in my explorer! But i have changed the entry of my "base" position up because i saw the wicks on 1H chart.

Profit this time on my side with proportion 1:1:2

Stats after 4pyramids: 3 succesfull / 1 "unsuccesfull" => BE because of bad entrys, emotion, and impatience!

Xandi i love this system, when i get more experience with it i´ll use it on my bigger accounts.

Selling at start of supply, expecting approach to 70 MA. Pyramid on top 50 step. Any comments.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Thanks Xandi,

Actually, I referred to source code of the EA, not the compiled one.

I'm not totally confident if using an EA without understanding how it works. That's the reason why I ask for source code.

Anyway, I think the EA is rarely used because price can't go against us 100 pips in a few seconds.

If needed I will write my custom one.

Thanks again for sharing your brilliant idea. It's really emotionless.

My trade last night is already +30. If target hits then it's nice. If not then I already have a pyramid below.

hello

regarding eurusd, it´s legitime to short eurusd, but dailytf,weekly, and 4 htf are inside Ich cloud, so price can go everywhere...good luck, you have everyth set..don´t forget you can change on Pending Orders the entry price and the TP, the EA still work if you do that!

now you wait price drop near 30/50 pips from maximum and you buy again..that because we still are below Ich Cloud on daily!!

ps: in this move, since it´s still not ended, I entered again in only a drop of 15/20 pips of previous maximum...let´s profit more!!!!!

seemss good that audnzd...on daily and weekly is indeed farfar away from Ichcloud...never notice in this pair...

ps: the only thing I don´t like it´s because is 2 neighbour currencies, like Eurgbp or EurAud...I only like to trade this method on specific pairs...but it desearves a look for next week trade!!

bro, sincerily, it was only the last trades...you can see by the chart of returnby trade, and you´ve been following here...next week I´ll trade by the book and show you the right proportion...I been trading with correct leverage unil the last couple of days(i´m testing on edge)...I trade that on live account..I´m only perhaps waiting the end of the month to start atach new live account with MT4((my actually is SaxoTrader, don´t have connection to TE.

I started with 3000$ and lot 0.1/0.2...with 6000 should be 0.2/0.3, and with 9000$ should be 0.3/max 0.5...that with my levverage account...with your I suggest half of my Lot!!!

I enjoy your charts, simple and well calculated harmonic...feel free to post bro, enjoy having you here, everyone sharing!

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Sure thing my friend, I have been thinking of building a pyramid of sorts on this one due to harmonic and potential, but tough to trade a monthly chart.

Enjoy your vacation, looks beautiful.

it´s seems great! and also I mix price action on building the pyramid, so armonic can fit also!!! the most importat is, we become to have a plan...it takes back the stress on trading..at least, reduce a lot!!! once more, let me "salut" you: welcome!

Thanks for your hints!

I realized that I've learnt a very good money management strategy from you.

I will combine it with my entry strategy which is based on what I've learnt from 'Similarity' thread.

At least, I feel my trading plan is clearer now and I can't wait for next week to experiment

Have a nice vacation

--- 帖子 #641 ---
thank xixi!! it´s fair you use divergence to entry on trade, but take care to not break any Principal Rule, for example shorting AudUsd because you received an entry short term signal on your system...the Risk is prepared to be minimized on the Pyramid Rules...

Regarding trading,  the W chart still valid on weekly, and cloud on daily is now very close (not so good for longs), so I´m pointing 9320 at least this week...

--- 帖子 #642 ---
hey xandi,

this Asia session could be interesting! => JPY

we´ll see!

AudNzd paying good!! take note it´s fullfill the requirements of approach to IchCloud...thanks Tomoney and PriceAction1

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I am glad that you like it  We should have our eyes opened and look for some other oportunities than audusd, but it is correct what you observed that moves on audusd are bigger than on audnzd.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
you should study

AUD/CAD

AUD/CHF

AUD/JPY

all except A/CHF have better R&R than AUD/NZD

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I had some trades on audcad but didn't look at audchf and audjpy last time. Thanks for call, I will check them

--- 帖子 #647 ---
yap, still in love to Audusd, bought with TP 50 pips, after all, the previous maximum on friday was 9230, we are 50 pips below, and expecting approach to 9320, so perfect place to re-entry...

--- 帖子 #648 ---
after a quick check, no-one of that pairs is so faraway from Ichcloud on daily/week than AudNZD..so just for start, today, audnzd is climbing up much more than any other Aud pair...and more volatily.

you use SL!! in our case it would have worked with reinforcement!!

ps: going to pack the baggage, this week I will use reinforcements on 100 pips, 1st entrys TP 50 pips, I will reenter again 50 pips below previous max, and jump off Pyramid > BE on 25/50 pips.. enjoy!

tp hit,+50 pips....reentered again...this tp was easy,look to daily chart..

Im on paradise algarve, hot&great beaches...

Where are you?im disapointing with your participation here...

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hey xandi,

I am preparing to my vacations this weekend but I still have my trades on audnzd in play. It looked good on charts, because it was far away from clouds but you were right with its bigest disadvantage: neigbour currencies like this gives small moves. They are so small in this case that it is difficult to close trades even on BE. I will keep them at the moment, but it is a good lesson for me and for other viewers not to make same mistake.

This night I made some money on our favourite currency - audusd  I didn't post it because it is nothing special I think here. No pyramid, just a normal trade with profit  I must think abput trade explorer after my free time

Besides this audnzd trades I reentered long audusd in the morning. Bought @ 92358 with standard TP of +30 pips. In bad case (what is in pyramid system a good case No.2) I have pending buy 90 pips lower, so let it go where it wants to be

Btw. what a sunny day in Poland

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I took a bad trade this morning at Asian session (buy AU at 9267, yeah right at a top of M15 chart, i know ) and after that news dragged price down about 70 pips. I have a pyramid right below but wasn't trigger. Let's see how it goes at NY open.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
AUD / USD position and pendings open,

last trades no pyramid, first position allways hit TP, Pending yesterday overnight also hit TP.

one open Trade ATM.

have a nice week.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
hmm.. had a chance to close at BE but was greedy

the second pyramid is ready

--- 帖子 #662 ---
if you have a pyramid with suboptimal entries it is better to close it BE than to make a loss...

just take a look at my TE

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Yeah, that's right. I already set TP at BE but finally I changed it. Need to be more disciplined.

Thanks for your advice!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Pending is now an opened trade - started pyramid.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hey guys! Nice to see you active here! Done another pyramid,look to my last 2 trades..was perfect, 90 pips gap by the book, reccomended to vavation...I even didn,t know I had it open,  i changed the tp before sleep, and wake up on profit, as expected...the Tp was find like that 9320 on daily, but this time on hourly Tf=9180..

Take care, pyramid brothers

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hit TP here. Have a look at the ticket

My entry is not good but this is pyramid, so I still end up with +5%. My first live pyramid

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Was the entry on the first long bad because it was in the cloud?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Congratulations btw : )

--- 帖子 #673 ---
^^ first entry wasn´t that good because it was the finiesh of the retracement => that should be an exit.

i (and i quess xandi and tomoney too) use 4h and above TF to determine above/in/below cloud.

nevertheless 5% with one pyramid is great

i needed 2 weeks for the same return.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Yeahhh! That,s the way i like, great disciples of Pyramid!

xixi, there,s no bad entrys, since specialy if on daily is far away from cloud and approuching...,but 4peeps reminded well,if was talking like thodie say on 4h tf above..even so, its good sand to build!

now you wait retrace 50 pips from last high amd reenter again..rolling&rolling...

ps: algarve is the sea/fish food paradise,and hot summer beaches...if i had EA here, i would trade..in this conditions is difficult...target 9400@audusd

Happy congrats you bro's

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Thodie,ive been watching,  what a great week you had! 250 pips, few pyramids needed! You know what it is! You getting confidence on the system! Beware of the man with a plan!

--- 帖子 #676 ---
you enjoying with hot summer and sea food!!! just want to thank you. as I adopt one of your idea, which save me two time i.e no stop loss but add a position and close it brake even. I leave the demo and first week of live. it is sweet 150% on very low fund going to with draw the profit so now house money is to play for.

best regards.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
In the future you will also adopt the low leverage on first brick you build!(3:1 or 5:1 on 200:1 account) Soon...rules bro, in order to nothing goes wrong!congrats..go easy...thanks bro!

--- 帖子 #678 ---
thank you xandi,

yes i get more confidence, especially with the entries, thinking about to raise initial position size to 1.5 of account size.

nice weekend to all pyramidators

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Hello  I am going at the seaside this week, so probably I will not view the thread so often. Have a nice week to everybody here!

--- 帖子 #680 ---
No 4peeps, the cloud is just a reference on higher TF as xandi said.

In this case, the entry is bad because I longed at the retracement of a very bearish move. If you look few bars back your could see a bar with very long wicks up & down, that means all orders on the way have been filled. Following that bar is a very bearish one. So high chance is that it is the start of a very bearish move afterwards.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
I think it depends, 5% on my account means almost nothing

--- 帖子 #682 ---
yeah, xandi. That's a way how Pyramid work. In a very bad case we can still end up with profit or at least BE.

Nice vacation! Hope I'll have a vacation when my pyramid growth. Will see...

--- 帖子 #683 ---
xandi  many thanks for posting this system, and congratulations on your success.

can i ask if the ichimoku cloud you use has the default settings for mt4? would it be possible to also further clarify some of the entry criteria for a trade?  are there any additional indicators/criteria  you use apart from ichi, MA and sup/dem?

a template and indicator/s would be handy. sorry if i am asking newb questions.

jejejeje  and welcome to the hot sands of the sahara!

To show how. this system works without needing to be on screen, works without emotion, lets say that in 7 weeks of trading i was 3 weeks on holidays, trading even without pc..

--- 帖子 #693 ---
this weekend i will summarize the entry issue,with all details written on these 30 pages....foe example, this time i entered with more leveragw on my 1st brick...why? Because price already dropped 200 pips fast,and i was not building, so i can enter now better...also because W formation posted on previous chart weekly tf...and also because price still faraway on above 4h tf from cloud.

Ps: reccomended leverage is max 5:1 on 1st brick.

Going to the beach...

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hello Xandi,

Great results, nice method. I have implemented it on my system, i trade on 5 min watching 15, 60 and 4H. I used normally a 10 pips SL, that I used to move whenever I noticed that I entered to soon, never more than 20 pips. last week instead of the SL, i have been entering trades to recover the same way you do, although much closer than you. So far is has been good, I had to use only twice, but both recovered well and got profit.

The biggest advantage for me is stress that is much less. I will not trade this week, starting my vacation. I´ll follow the thread. My turn to go south.

Best regards,

António

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Hi aduarte!welcomeee!nice to have a conterranean bro here, on this desert spirit!

Your method can be similar if you apply proportion calculation to mine... for example, if i enter with 5:1 with reinforce at 100 pip gap, if you want to reinforce at 20 pips gap, you should enter 1:1 on that 5 times until you reach 100 pips gap... than you can start doubling, and so on...

We.ll talk more about! All the best, have nice holidays, bro, here at south is hot and paradise...carvoeiro beaches and alvor reccomended, seafood festival on faro...delicious!

Ps: ended on 2nd on ranking, started a pyramid yesterday and still on, so it dropped the equity...excelent result!

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Jejejeje...upsssss...i prooved myself how can this system fail...entering with leverage above 10:1 on first brick, on account 200:1...

On this example i entered with 50:1 on 1st brick, and reinforce on 50 pips below doubling...only 80 pips destroyed the account... last day of vacation, last day trading on this demo...with the month end, therevwas no morw motivation...next week ill start live! Cheers bros

Ps. The last night pyramid workwd sweet, as always...

Great works Xandi!

I've just spent a week live trading with mixed results, made a lot of mistakes with entries, psychology control, discipline,...

Now I understand that live trading is different. It really taught me many lessons and I have come up with some new ideas for next weeks which I believe will improve my performance better.

Wish you go live with great success!

he got too greedy and did not follow his own rules.

as I posted earlier his lot size is far too high and this time he went even higher saying A/U dropped so much,

so I can trade even higher lot size.

his distance to the next trade was not his usual 90/100 pips.

this is a way of trading which WILL fail at some stage, even with his usual system.

hope Xanti you will change your lot size to survive long-term.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I think this is a great concept.....minus the martingaling of the lots(for me).....that sooner or later will cause troubles,

cause we are going to make a mistake, only GOD is GOD......

I am sure in the end my buddy will perfect it.....

lolll bro´s!!!

the month was over!! I had not more enough motivation to keep going the demo!!!

yestrday I pyramidated with firts lot 9:1(1 lot), double lot 80 pips below with 2 lot, and the last lot was 60 pips below, doubling again = 4 lots...worked fine because even the starting leverage was above 5:1, I respected +/- distance between reinforcements...conclusions on that pyramid, If I keep following the rule, I had more than enough to hold a direct drop down of 300 pips (minimum requirement)...and I jumped off at BE, it worked as always here all the month...

After that pyramid, today at NY open, I had/wanted a moment of free stupidity!! I was stopped out on the first fall of 80 pips, I think that tells enough!!! hoppefully we have learn a lot with this experience, and following this time!

... those who are here most of the time, knows how this can work..and it´s written!!

yonnie, that pyramid you are talking I closed it with 10 pips profi, I explain it above... the last trades xixi was refering I enter on a gap of 50 pips with 24 lots...

but yes yonnie, the thing more important in this system is leverage/margin account, and that we already know from beggiing...so I have my conclusions, it´s called testing!! the rules are written quite time ago:

"Patience, understanding, love!...most of all we need love!

bro´s, a pic of my spirit returning today 600 km from south holidays!!!!! uuuuuuhhh...trance rolling...going forward!!!!

ps: will start live hoppefully next week as soon I have leverage account 200:1 open working witMT4.

the trade explorer here from ForexFactory is perfect!! It shows you the leverage of each open position, so you must have to use the right calculation of leverage use...it´s the most important thing!!

My own experience tell me that

5:1 on 1st position

GAP/interval of 90/100 pips

double the LOT size (leverage total used +/- 20:1 in all open position)

GAP/interval of 90/100 pips

and so on...in my own risk it´s safe, but it´s the maximum possible!! I might start live with less...

Thanks Xandi for yr time and for sharing this great system. I have learned a new way to trade!

Xandi with all due respect, are you aware that you're taking massive losses or am I missing something?

hello! yap, i think you´re missing something...maybe an entire jouney of trading, 7 weeks...this last example was the exception, as you can see on multiple charts of TE...testing till the hedge, it was explained above...keep cool

I thought something was odd, thanks.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Hi Xandi,

I see that you exploded your demo account ?  I look forward to following you live.

Just to say, why don't you get a broker with higher leverage than 200 ? This is not to say that you could trade more lots from start but a higher leverage broker needs less margin to trade so more room for the drawdowns that you inevitably experience with your system. Think about it, it could be important !

For your info, I use Roboforex (who provide 500) since 3 months and I'm happy with them but there certainly others out there.

Good luck and trade well on your new account.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
yesss!!! I´m saying 200:1 at least, because is the maximum I´m achievieng here in Portugal on MT4, and without microlot...going to check Roboforex, and if I can open the account...

I´m only with half of the balance I want to deposit in the new account..so I´m using more leverage than it´s supposed to!

Do not forget that in the 1st brick we should use 5:1 leverage and only reinforce 90 pips below (it means 90 pips below your first entry you should be using only 10:1/~/15:1 leverage, before the reinforce)...

I posted before the scale on previous post...I´m using 500:1 account!

...

or make your calculation in order to your pyramid can hold a sharp drop of 300 pips / 500 pips without needed retracement to jump off at BE...

it´s running well this night!!!! keep running

You rock my friend!! Keep going.....

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Xandi,

you are using 1-2-4-8-16 sequence now instead of 1-1-2-4-8, so your total position will grow a lot faster.

what is the reason you changed to the new sequence?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
because price was farfaraway even on 4h from ichcloud...if price was close on 4htf and faraway on daily, I use 1-1-2-4...in this scenario you know what I think...and I was wright...4 TP hit this night...

ps: anyaway, like i said before, i have to wait 3 days in order to upload more balace again, so I using more leverage while I still don´t have the funds deposited...this strategy it´s a marathon, not velocist...this 40% in 2 days are not real, it should be between 10% and 20% in 2 days...

hehe, yes but with equity problems on the last pyramid...

was too confident and started 2-2-4-8 so i add more funds to the account for the 16size position...

as the pyramid closed BE i remove them today. so return is about 25% on inital capital.

the next pending pyramid stones are layed in the sand with exact 1-1-2 equal account size.

our whole life is builded on a pyramid

--- 帖子 #739 ---
for what i´ve seen, it seems your account is only 100:1 leverage? can you confirm? when I use 5:1 leveragen on 1st brick (respecting 90 pips gap reinforce), I done those calculations to accounts above 400:1 leverage...how much is yours on oanda?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
thats right,

i start now with 0,5 or 1 equal position size

--- 帖子 #741 ---
that´s right is only 100:1 account leverage? and you don´t want to change that?? it´s highly reccomendable!!!!

you are saying you will start with positions 0.5:1 or 1:1 leverage on 1st brick? it might be proportional to mine, don´t know, try to calculate how much you can enter on 1st trade, reinforcing 100 pips below, to hold a sharp drop of 350 or 500 pips without being stopped out...with that you get your safe entry, assuming reinforcements on every 100 pips, and after you can make your adjustements to your reinforcement strategy...

if you have a account above 300:1 leverage you did not have to deposit more fund on 16th stage...

this is all about riskmanagement, leverage used on open position control....

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Xandi,

Can you post a chart with one of your trades? Also, are you using the same trading system(not pyramid)?

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I only use pyramid...if price goes from the start on my way, perfect...if not, I pyramidate...you have to read more bro!

chart? what do you mean? the only chart needed is that on 4htf ichcloud is at 9200, on daily is much farway, not to talk on weekly...

if all my positions reach TP (like it happened this night), I wait a retrace of 50 pips from last relative high and I reenter long again (just like I did)

ps: I´m searching an EA that works as Trailing stop, that create pending buy order 50 pips below from the last relative high, like trail stop does to close position...but in this case, I want to open position...if anyone knows if is available, I´ll appreaciate...

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Have a look at this tread bro....there are a couple of trail EA's......maybe you will find something usefull......

look how the "trailing limit buy" i´m searching about would have worked beautiful on this example...price went this morning to 9000 (it was the relative high), retraced 50 pips below (the Traling buy would be triggered) and now price was reaching again your TP...

this trailing EA combined with the Pyramid EA = ROBOT  machine!.. it will be my next step gathering this toy!

would you recommend roboforex?

yap...I choosed pro-standard, the only doubt is if fix-standard is better..the difference is between market execution or instant execution..choose 500:1 ... to deposit money there you have to upload with paypal or skrill, it´s easy..

I have market execution, but spread 2.2 on audusd...on fix-standar we can have Instant execution but 4 pips spread...

--- 帖子 #760 ---
ok, i clarified my doubt! Instant execution is much much better than Market execution...I have to change that in this account...Even EA do not work correctly on Market execution....there are no requotes on Instant, going to change, even having a large spread on audusd, 4 vs 2.2

Hey glad to be on board with the pyramid crew.....first full pyramid and it worked a treat......I'm still very much getting used to things and trying to get my leverage etc optimized.

Thanks for introducing this method....I look forward to learning it fully.

you will enjoy bro!!!

regarding leverage is as Ive been tolding...5:1 on first brick --> 90 pips reinforce below..that´s +/- the proportion!

and you have Trade Explorer which is excelent to see the leverage used on each open position...I love it!!

ps: forget it, im trying some long from here, asia session!!!

--- 帖子 #765 ---
ahhhh..it not seems good scenary to enter long here...the 8900 is indeed best place...well, let´s see if im going to give up this pyramid, and let pending orders work as i am sleeping...on 4htf and dailytf price is approaching fast of ichcloud...only weekly is faraway!

--- 帖子 #766 ---
it´s being difficult to upload the remain deposit to the account!! have to wait a confirmation code in my account...so I still have to be more exposed to risk, with more leverage...but I´ve warning, 5:1 on first brick -> 90 pips gap, more than that, is by your own risk...

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I´m not liking this move, yesterday night I warned about the better spot to enter long should be 8900...now it seems 8840 the best place...so I´m trying to close the pyramid at BE, 8952, speccialy because Im too way leverage!

--- 帖子 #768 ---
bahh..jumped off at BE, but was not very smart...this question of upload deposit is affecting my trading, hoppefully next week I have everything settled!...

...even so, this is called "protect your balance"

--- 帖子 #769 ---
hello folks

i hope im not being a sponfed newbie  here,  but can somebody clear up the entry rules? also i'm struggling to understand what a pyramid is - is that sort of like martingale when price goes agaisnt you?

thanks folks / xandi

--- 帖子 #770 ---
a little more respect for the great pyramid! ..but yes, it appear to us when price is against...

the entry rules you didn´t get it? I think it´s well explained on summary, even I have to detail it a little more...

short version, if you use the right leverage (which garantees a direct fall of 300 pips without retracement), and if you enter on the right side (by 2 monthe LONG on AUdUSD), on the end you will profit or jump off at BE..

...it´s simple...you have to read more, and experience more, test it more, share more,  and after you go LIVE! best advise I cannot give you...

entry rule:

enter when price is far away from ichcloud on 4htf, daily & weekly combined...contrarian trade, expecting approach to cloud...

use the TP you want, after your TP is reached, reenter again 50 pips below last previous high, on audusd...

use the right leverage...

if price goes against you, pyramidate following the rules...

Hi Xandi,

Welcome back from holliday, I hope you did enjoy :-)

Question: How do you manage several trades at the same time? It seems that sometimes you open more posisitions? (and I dont mean pyramidate positions)

--- 帖子 #775 ---
hello xinix!!! a happy welcome to you, bro!!!

I enjoyed a lot vacation!! and I will be more&more&more in that stage!

"It seems that sometimes you open more posisitions?" -- not relevant, it´s all a question of proportion ponderation...I manage trades setting automatic TP...always..in all positions

so imagine, if I 1st entry with only 2:1 lev at 9000...I can enter again with another 2:1 at 9010...so my "1st entry" ponderated is 9005!! so I change TP based on that ponderations, to all open positions...basic math! get it?

ps:my old broker had that information, called "price medium" of all open positions...maybe in MT4 there is some tool that show it...

--- 帖子 #776 ---
ok I think I got it :-) So an entry with low laverage allows you to add more trades. But at the end you close all open trades, using same TP.

So your EA is able to manage more entries? (is that: add pending and modify open trades EA?)

--- 帖子 #777 ---
no, that´s the 1st version, I´m using the last one, it´s better to see the respective thread where it was created...test it on demo, and use instant execution account..., ask your questions there about the EA, I´ll answer! but the EA is able to change the TP in all open position, when pending order is triggered...

--- 帖子 #778 ---
4th temptive to break the top..it will break! i was expecting a small retrace to 8950 in order to reenter again, maybe i will not have the chance...

--- 帖子 #779 ---
as expected...now i´m counting the time to the retrace so I can jump in on the wave!!it´s difficult, this day triggered me out because the leverage issue...I choose to close on BE, in normal conditions and being only the 2nd step of the pyramid, I would not have closed it!

--- 帖子 #780 ---

maybe more 2 hours...it´s forming bullish pennant on 1 hour...with employment news it´s possible to raise another 100 pips...if not, pyramid calling, so manage your leverage, no more than 10:1 maximum!!!that if your account is 500:1 leverage...

But at least it is only demo at this stage so I can play around as much as I want.....but I am trying to treat it as much as I can a live account.

If I knew what I was doing and more confident in my method I'd contribute more so it's not just you updating all the time.....but keep it up coz your posts are always of value!

Where will you look for next opportunity when/if AUDUSD daily gets to the cloud? Will you look at the other pairs listed on the summary page for opportunities? (USE on eurusd, audusd, eurjpy, usdchf, usdjpy...)

I would like to present an alternative EA for this system. The idea is to make it even easier to place your orders

and build your pyramid. You don't have to enter the ticket number of your base trade, and you don't have to modify the lotsizes

of the pyramid.

The lotsizes are calculated from your base trade. The pyramid used, is 1-1-2-4-8-16. You can change the pyramid multipliers of course.

(A value of zero means, that level will not be set).

All you have to do is, put the EA on the chart of the symbol you want to trade. Then place a trade manually and set the takeprofit. The EA does all the rest.

The step size of the pending orders is set to 100 pips, but you can change this of course too.

PLEASE DON'T USE THIS EA ON A REAL ACCOUNT NOW!! THE EA HASN'T BEEN TESTED ENOUGH YET.

Feedback is welcomed of course

--- 帖子 #814 ---
hehehehehehe...thanks for your help bro!!good work!!!!! I´ll try, it seems more STANDARD by default!! less flexible, but more strategy standard!! thanks

We already have other final version (attached), where we don´t have to put the Order Number, only the comment to link to the master  trade, and it works also if the Master Original Trade is a pending order.your does that also?

we also are creating the Set in Motion part with Trailing buy limit..the idea is on thread...have experience on that?if you can help, send pm to work all together!!

many thanks !

so bro´s, test also this version, and give me feedback on both, from gumrai and chjungen...

Good job Xandi.. You seem like you are good at picking your entries.. Besides from price being far away from the cloud, are you looking for anything else before you enter the market?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
retracements...read post #803 yesterday night!

Because of that we are building a "trailing buy limit", it means when price drop 50 pips from last high, I reenter..or use other technique...

that happen yesterday night, price was on afternoon at 9140, so I put pending buy at 9090!!! I do this when I have strong convicton price is really approaching on time frames above 4h!

some day we will have to change the pair, because daily already on ichcloud...it ´s missing weekly, but, until then, price might retest the bottom, so I´m not sure any long about longs since 92000 was hit...

ps: First of all, I start to build long as you said when price is far far away on 4h TD/daily/weekly...but if price approach on 4htf, it doesn´t mean I stop entry long...do you get it? we have to catch the approaching moove itselfs also, combinning 4h&daily TF..

--- 帖子 #823 ---
heheeeeee!!!!!!

broo, I´m still in doubt on Pro-standard or Fix standard....To use EA (and I will use almost 80% in the future) the fix is better...on the other hand, the spread is the double, audusd 2.2 pips on Pro, 4 pips on Fix...but as we don´t scalp, those pips issues is not much relevant....FIX is Instant Market(you click and always execute, and spread is fix), the Pro is Market Execution sometimes it might take long to execute, or requote, and spread not fix...(I did not have any requote, util now perfect, but that question of EA is bothering me...)

IIn the future I´m going to change, until  that,  I keep using Pro...finnaly you have the tool!!!!

Hi Xandi,

You made my day. My strategy is totally different from you. But thanks to the idea of break-even points, I can develop my strategy to the next step. Thank you so much!

From beginning, I thought it was another strategy of Martingale system. However, it's different and less risky than Martingale. But still, for example, I only trade 0.01 lot in my 1000E account. It gives good result.

All best wishes to you!

Cheers

--- 帖子 #829 ---
of course is different, we are smart guys, we have to take advantage of the best that any system can give us!!! good luck bro, all the best, keep posting your experience!!!

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Here it is, ranging market makes me blow my head. But, thanks to your idea, I can solve the problem. Still much work to do. However, better result than before.

P/s: Just tell me if my picture makes your topic be complex. Just wanna share my strategy.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
you have here a place to share your ideas!!! feel free to do it bro!, alwayss! I get your point by your chart...Im only worried because you are using 30 min TF, possible reinforcements on few pips interval...so you must control very very well the leverage!!!  that´s why my strategy has that specific condition, buy on extreme oversold on high Timeframes, because the chancs of still having a sharp dropdown more than 300 pips are few....

but keep trying your method, keep gathering ideas and experience, we will win with that behaviour!

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Totally agree with you. 30m TF is so dangerous. As you can see, it changes so fast and can reverse the trend immediately. I also use 4H TF. But u know, from the view of newbie, it takes sooo much effort to look at the hight TF chart(And I know it's not good at all). But, later on, I will change to 4H TF.

Thanks for your reply, bro!!!

Btw, u just use trend line? From the 1st post, u mention about Ichimoku, but I dont see it in your chart captures

--- 帖子 #833 ---
bahh..you miss the part when I say, "start from page 3, post #50"...have to put it in higher font??

that with trendlines was my first trading journal, I started this method only on page 3!!!

--- 帖子 #834 ---
for the 1st time in 2 months, I think Ill stop from buying this pair...9200 was my target, now it might retest the bottom, creating double bottom, and after recover again all the way up...I will wait and buy it again near 9000...have a nice trades

ps: trying the new&improved EA

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Hello everybody! Hello xandi! I just came from 2 weeks at the seaside and I see a lot of happened here  I was reading thread in a free time on my smartphone, but didn't trade. Now my batteries are full and I am going to continue my existance here with profits as usual.

Xandi, CONGRATULATES

--- 帖子 #836 ---
yó yó yóóóóó!!! brooo!!!! welcome back!!!!!   did you build many pyramids on beach sand on your holidays!?! hehehehehehehehehehe

at this moment I´m giving a break to audusd, I´m full commited testing the new Motion EA, and I have to test it on Demo, and I have to wait aud at 9000 again or search another pair, this I still haven´t done yet...but there are some around the corner!!! after we will search and start trading again!!!

--- 帖子 #837 ---
hee peepo!!!!!how are you bro!!!?! I see you have Trade Explorer attached, and nice return by trade, as also nice technique!! I kind of find familiarityies in your trading style...going to check it better!!

all the best bro, and Please bring back Oscar Cardozo from my squad!! it´s only doing non-sense actions this pre-season!!

--- 帖子 #838 ---
please give a huge welcome to our brother, Gumrai!!

Give a stand ovation and an ocean of thanks regarding is brilliant work here together with us!!!! he is making things I only dreamed about!! "anything is possible, until when he tries it"

love you bro

--- 帖子 #839 ---
I hope that you mean  "anything is possible, when he tries it"

You give me too much credit mate. I fumble my way through this coding lark and seem to get there in the end, simply due to determination.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
And I am only coding according to your plans, so if it works, it is down to you Xandi

--- 帖子 #841 ---
If you are fumbling now and coming up with this kind of work I can't imagine what you will do when you really get the hung of it

--- 帖子 #842 ---
good job gumrai and welcome back to tomoney

--- 帖子 #843 ---
!! oooppssss, sorry my bad english!!!it was funny * going to amend it!!!my grateful thankssssss bro * !!!

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Thanks 4x,

Is it OK to use your first name?

You have to remember that 2 months ago, I knew nothing about coding, I am very much a novice, so everything that I post should be tested thoroughly on demo.

I hope that there will be feedback from the people here if the EA does something unexpected. That will help me to make the EA better.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...82#post6884582

for those who want to try...but this new one only works creating trailing limit buy from the 1st trade... we´ll create another to work from the beginning with manual/pending, and after tp is hit will play motion with trailing buy...and we need to have the 2 options!!! ...

if you are not getting now, on the future you will..the audusd is not good to trailing at this moment, it was this past 2 months as you have seen!!!

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I see that chjungen offered an EA some posts back,

This could be an opportunity for 2 brains to work on any further developments.

chiungen, if you are interested in working together, please post in the other thread

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Xandi,

Just post my trade today. Break-even trades. Ranging market in G/J

Without your idea, I may loss some today. Thanks man!

--- 帖子 #848 ---
nice to hear that! but keep in mind this concept is much more way deep than the way you are using it...and if price still going against you when you have those 0.07?? will you reinforce or use SL?? and how much reinforce can you do until the margin call??

understand that the written rules on my strategy summary were fully tested and everyone should know and feel confortable with them, knowing his own account...measuring the leverage in the open positions it´s a great tool to know if we are doing the things right!!

keep peaceful trades bro!!!!

--- 帖子 #849 ---
My friend Gumrai.....you can call me even "Wilma" if your coming out with EA's like these.....

Hey don't you call me Wilma...

Now let me get serious ..... I spoke to Xandi about the option I pm you about and he really likes that idea....he thinks it is imperative....

The idea is if the system initiates  more than 3 recovery trades the EA automatically arranges all positions to close at BE.... at whatever price it has to be....

I hope I explained it clear this time....

Thanks again

4x

--- 帖子 #850 ---
wilma!!!  I´m thinking on let that issue to the end of the process!!!!! I´ve spoke to Gumrai, we have to arrange the TP issue of the created pendings, the perfect should be all the pending which are created were with TP at BE...so when they are triggered, they always change the TP of the all positions in orders to us achieve the BE...

it´s going to be made, it been taking care...but now 4xpipa, we are finishing the most important part, the play motion in 2 separated EA, or other idea gumrai and chjungen can have!!!

Hi,I need help with money manager

I'm using Oanda started with $400 leverage 1:50

if I'm using 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08

I'm try to caculate how much I need for 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16 next

or Table Charts O_o

--- 帖子 #852 ---
1:50?? can´t you get better account?? this calculations to the 1st position 5:1 in order to hold at least a drop of 500 pips without retracement are made to accounts 1:500...

so you can imagine the difference...

so your 1st position at maximum must be 0,5:1 leverage...look at Trade Explorer, try it on DEMO, and see the size lot with account of 400$ in order to get those 0,5:1 on your 1st open position...it´s not going to be easy to check, because the leverage don´t have decimals on TE...but you will find it, and share your calculations here, I help you...

--- 帖子 #853 ---
sorry, now I see you have already TE active!! nice decision, much easier to help!!!ok, you are a little above, 3:1, but you can´t get lower than 3:1 because you are already with 0.01 lot...so use those  0.01 lot on 90 pips interval, and use this pattern to protect you:

0.01 + 0.01 + 0.02 +0.02  + 0.04 + 0.08.. and so on...maybe is better to your account risk!  90 pips interval!!!!!

ps: in order to profit without risk, think on change your account to at lest 1:400 leverage...

ps2: you are longing eurjpy?it  is below ich cloud on higher TF? have to check that...

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Thanks Xandi

I'm using Oanda because minimum deposit and accept paypal deposit

--- 帖子 #855 ---
ok, there are a lot other brokers which don´t have minimum deposit and accept paypal deposits! and with leverage account higher...don´t want to suggest any, but you should search information about it, because 1:50 it´s difficult to trade with so few money...you might be in risk while build pyramid, bro! and this is quite the opposite, the principal rule is to hold a sharp drop of 300 pips without being on margin call!!!!!and your broker is happy with perspective!!!

ps: you don´t need to deposit more $$$$ ... you have more than enough!!!take that clear! you need more leverage...

--- 帖子 #856 ---
might try eToro but spread on EU is 3 and minimum position size 0.1

most of them don't accept US resident

any suggest or warning?

sorry I discuss about broker in here

--- 帖子 #857 ---
don´t suites you!!!!!! it´s a good to debate here (not brokers)..because more important than price action trading, is good risk management...

keep searching, on asia I´ll help you on this...

ps: choose "instant execution", the spread is not relevant, we are not scalping!!!!

Xandi, nice to see you get 100% return in short time. If my memory still recall, you put in $1000 in the account,right? You're earning 460 pips, meaning average starting lot = 0.2?

--- 帖子 #878 ---
"meaning average starting lot = 0.2" ...hmmm, more 0.1 average....and the important is to get in your TE 5:1 ...I´m getting a little more by my own...(soon it will drop)

--- 帖子 #890 ---
that´s good..we can also divide by 2 our proportion...I mean, instead of reinforcement on 90 pips interval, I used this time 45 --> with corresponding instead of entering with 5:1 on 1st trade, I entered 2,5:1...

It´s our flexible pyramid..we only have to use proportion...in that way, and if we think there´s high probability of price going down from our 1st trade, we catch more mooves on that way...only if we have the suspicion price might drop, like I was, expecting near 9000, because price was already above of cloud on 4h, and near near on daily tf...

Xandi thanks for welcome

We trade similarly.I trade price channels stacking my orders
80% of forex is not trending.Instead price is stuck in a channel.We should buy or sell bottom/top 20% of the channel.If the move is in the middle skip it not a high probability trade instead look for another pair.

..."We trade similarly" I had noticed that, the few times we talked, I remember somes debates, one rispid one at AudUsd thread, with a few moralist &naive or disrespectfull users trying to get over me...there I realize you use also specific some kind of scale in...now I get it better, and with your journal even more perfect!!!

and most important, the EA doesn´t work on Market Execution, so keep that in mind...

Hi Xandi,

You are doing a great work.

I got interested and started reading your thread.

Then I adopted your strategy in a play account which is doing well.

I am thinking of raising the stake in a different account.

You can see my trade explorer-- I think Cad Jpy and Usd Chf also are good for this approach.

All the best and long live the Pyramid power!!

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Keep in mind that swissy trade left the boat sort of speak.At 9326 its 132 pips late entry.Ideally you should of gone long at 92 or lower.

I have my limit orders waiting at 92.5 92 91.50

I kind of anticipate a retrace from 94 back to 92.

--- 帖子 #899 ---

going to take a look...don´t know if im in the mood for more, maybe..thanks for your call, wish you nice trades brooo..

ps: I´ve looking, only on my htc, and for 1st impression, the conditions are not met to enter in gbpcad or gbpusd..the conditions regarding the approach to ichcloud on 4hTF,dailyTF & weekly TF combined....it could be better, I still prefer audusd long!!!  On Asia I´ll post the chart so I can support my review...but all the best trades&luck to you friend! i´m not familiarized with those pairs and type of mooves...

Yes Xandi

Its always good to show restrain and discretion.One does not need to have lot of pairs to make money.

I am looking good spot to go long on Aussie as well.

On Aussie I am looking more on down side because price failed to break 92(does not mean it can't ).Most likely it may go into range.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
yep, exactly what I think and I´ve been posting, probably will test again the bottom...but because the bottom is only 200 pips far away, and is still the chance on dailyTF go above to touch the cloud (9260), I still consider solid ground to build pyramid..of course the best choice will be near 9000 and 8900...and because of weekly chart I still being only long here...

I will deeply study your suggestion on gbp pairs and other in your gret journal!!

ps: I have to take relaxing time to read it and drink a glass of wine with you meanwhile

--- 帖子 #914 ---
One way to maximize immediate gain is to assume for example tonight news is positive on cable on retail sentiment.

We assume price most likely will spike 70-100pips during London.With average ADR that's about right.

So you can set you limit "pyramid" at 80pips above present price say 56 and add your usual increments whichever you like I prefer every 50pips.

This is my thinking process hence I look at news differently.

Most news other then major ones are usually retraced to starting point.

ok, i took the night for scalp with pure price action...on best pair to do that, eurjpy! more risky but I´m not so rusty on that!!

ps: same logic: short short short eurjpy... long long long audusd...

for those who think market execution is good for scalp, because has lower spread...

i shorted at 130.30 and for my surprise broker gave me at 130.24...ridiculous...not for talk on the eternity that last to order be executed...

After following you guys for a couple of days , i think i am going to build my first pyramid on that sharp eur/usd fall , hope the pyramid spirit will be with me

--- 帖子 #927 ---
wee keep trying, and noone type of reeinforcement is better than the original Pyramid rules (1st page summary)...

...price fall from 9150, what´s the best spot for double pyramid reinforcement??

ovious 90 pips below, 9060....

If needed I will reinforce strong only  90 pips below, 8970...

what a bag of bad trades of mine...

ps: only after close the trades i will read your post...but leverage is too way much, mainly because I still don´t made the remain deposit upload I want...you know the rule, 5:1 on 90 pips gap

Isn't this strategy like martingale strategies? With your entry rules, one black swan will blow up your entire account. Is the goal to amass capital and quit before the black swan happens?

Hi xandi,

Have you made some new reaserch for any other currencies to trade (not only aud/usd pair)?  To be honest after my free time I don't feel aud/usd. At the moment I am long an ucad @ 1,03461 with usual TP.

--- 帖子 #952 ---

hmm, I stiil holding aud usd, this time it will go above cloud on daily, it might happen...

after Ill swith to eurjpy, i think..but I will patrol all the curriencies this weekend!!!

True story my pharaoh   I am quiet, because I have so many things on my head that it is good to me when I can do my best on forex and read the thread, but then it is not enough to write. I have to drink more coffee!

I don't know why but I like ucad, you could have an eye on it. About EJ it is tricky, I will observe it for a few days to see how does it move, because I have never traded it reguraly. I am sure that if you are going to switch to EJ after audusd there is a potential there. I will just try to notice it

Hello, Xandi, Thanks to this knowledgeable posts of yours. It opens up new idea of tradings for me.
I just wonder if you've ever used this strategy on Hedging ? ie : when buy is losing you turn to sell with certain martingale....

take care.

In your worst experience, how many layers of pyramid you had to deal with (only 1time...... 5th time ... ??).... In other words, how many pips down from the first trade, and how many days did you come out of thiese series of trades ?

--- 帖子 #965 ---
300 pips down in a row, before the retracement....

3/4 reinforcements on 90 pips interval following the strategye..

Regarding AudUsd or other pair used (read 1st page), and being below ichcloud or (MA) on 4htd & daily TH when I´m longing, the maximum I saw was 300 pips --> to jump off at Breakeven.

I´ve seen guys having it open 3/4 weeks, and at the end closing it with hughe profit, but they were not concerned to close it on Breakeven, they had leverage to hold 10 or more reinforcements, 1000 pips fall sharp...and it´s by far the most profitable account I ever seen....

On Strategy Summary, the minimum required is to hold a sharp fall of 300 pips..easy like that!

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Hedging has its place Xandi, but not the way that most people on this forum approach it.

Hedging is supposed to reduce risk and the normal way is to take a position on a derivative, ie a different instrument, such as an option.

Most people consider that they are hedging by taking the exact opposite position, of course, this offers no advantage.

Would these people go into a casino and play roulette by betting on both red and black?

I would hope not, because it should be obvious that it is impossible to win that way. All the times that black or red come up, all that happens is that you get your money back.

When 0 or 00 come up, you get nothing back.

0 and/or 00 is equivalent to the broker's spread.

exactly!!!! absolutely agree 100%...thanks for explaining in such a great way!! even on fx pairs you can hedge...if you trade bolth +/- opposite correlated pairs, like long audusd and long usdjpy... great explanation bro!

--- 帖子 #969 ---
After such a nice post, I am sorry to disagree with you

If you trade  long audusd and long usdjpy.

It boils down to that you are just trading long AUDJPY, but paying more spread because of the 2 positions.

ps: Gumrai, if I buy audusd and buy eurjpy, since these pairs lately has negative correlation, it´s considered hedging?

thanks for your words, thanks for following, we we´ll be stronger together..

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #980 ---
The way I see it, no.

I believe that correlation in forex should only be noted for assessing risk.

Eg. if a strategy indicates taking a long position on both EURUSD and GBPUSD, you may consider reducing position size, if entering both trades.This is because they are considered correlated.

Actually they are only correlated because sudden strengthening of the USD would negatively affect both positions.

If they were truly correlated, then the EURGBP chart would show an almost flat line and this is not the case.

Say that you wanted to buy shares in a pharmaceutical company that is quoted on the S&P500.

Now, you know that, at times the S&P500 may tumble and this affects the price of companies that are performing well, not just the poorly performing.

This doesn't really make sense, but it happens.

So you may decide to limit your risk by buying the shares in the pharmaceutical company and also either shorting the S&P500 or shorting the pharmaceutical sector.

As long as the company out-performs its peers and/or the index, you will make a profit, but will be protected from losses if the index falls dramatically.

THAT is hedging.

--- 帖子 #981 ---
perfect explanation!!! hopefully now this issue is clear...the type of "hedging" which many uses here at FF, with cross position on same pair, is useless (imo)... the real Hedging, by opposite, is very useful! thanks for clarifying things!

ps: other thing useful is, for example, if I realized that 2 pairs are positive correlated, I can enter  half position on each, to assure I realize profit at least in one pair!...basic concept, using correlation to divesrifiy risk...

hello, txs to share your strategy but i'm not sure to understand how you proceed with TP

if you have TP @ 50 pips from entry for example and if price goes 30pips in your direction and after changes direction, what's your reaction ?

depends of the market situation and if we are at beginning or end of the pyramid i guess? or you have absolute confidence in pyramid and you let it run ?

money management is the key so i would like to be sure to understand

and congrat for your results

--- 帖子 #997 ---
hello thomasz!!! the strategy is/will be all automated..if the TP is 50 pips, I´ll wait to reach it...when we mix the strategy with emotion, it goes bad..for example this morning, I wanted to catch those 50 pips, but because badly issues on my trading lately (high leverage), I jumped off with only 10 pips...now I´m scalping with only price action, and I hate scalp, it´s completely out of the strategy!!! I have to left this bad habit I´m readquiring lately...

as you said, money management is the key, and my focus is on that!!!!

Xandi... Most people will tell you martingale/pyramid doesnt work.. But you are living proof .

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
they would be right if the probability of the colour of next candle was 50/50%...but in forex it is not, as also showen by mathematical users here like Eurusdd...

They would be tottally right, if they were talking about casino games, or the simple flipping the coin on the air (only inlimited funds will win)...

this is forex, and I don´t have to explain it more...

the other funny thing on a lot of guys who furious "attacks" martingale is that they talk with totally sure, many based on studies (money game/bets), but they don´t have other plan or system of trading with consistent profit...

there are many here!!! for those I simply tell, there are 90% of traders that loose all the money...and for sure they don´t all use martingale!!!... quite the opposite

The drawdown from 200% to 81% cumulative return just now reflects the tail risk embedded in this strategy. No offense to Xandi, as I believe there is an edge here, but I think the exit rules need to be more refined. The dangerous aspect of this strategy is that the leverage used is maximized as the unrealized lost increases. I don't think having embedded tail risks is good risk management because it limits the leverage that you can really use.

I've backtested a simple mean reversion strategy on AUD/CAD, NZD/CAD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD myself. Profit factors are above 3 but the issue is that there are substantial intraday drawdowns. Adding in any stop loss negatively impacts the results subsntially. These pairs have a strong tendency to eventually mean revert, which is the same behavior that your strategy profits from.

I've been folowing Your thread and method for a bit mate, already wrote something to You in private before but I think it's time to write it here

Don't rush for the $, focus on pips as You did before and it will work as it should be, making 200% in a week is cool but it's not the right way to do long term.

Your system is based on probability of price turning, dipper cuts make You load more onboard and lower Your BE price and You can't do the same while You want to play with such huge leverage.

Best wishes on Your way back to the green side as fast as possible.

what a great recovery (very impressive !!)

what cos the big drow down ?(i didn't read the all thread and i saw that you toke trad not according to the sys roles? am i correct?)

correct me if i am worng , you are looking for 100 pips movement and then start to bet a gains it while you looking to take 50 pips counter trad ? and if it does not follow your wish you jut white and open double position 100 pips again but than you

looking for  "be" for the all trad in total, and so on up to 4 or 5 trades .

did i get you right ?

keep doing the good job !!!!

thank you bro´s!! and sorry!!!

EliteNatt sayed it all, after a night of celebration, champagne bottles (damn you 4xpip) and all the party, I ended the night pure scalping price action with huge leverage, as elitenatt saw, I suppose I was trading with 400:1 on 1st open position...so I decide to trade free, long/short whatever, I traded all my eyes could forecast, speccially on 1 min TF, fear controlled me and rapt me for 2/3 hours!!!! it was a helll!!! yesterday more sobrious I decided to try to rescue the account but walking on dangerous shortcuts!!!!! It´s the problem of high leverage, when you see price against you are with hands tight, so many times we end closing position and even after oppening the opposite side, and there you know the story, price recover all the way, and you are doomed!!!!!

well, this is the opposite road I want to follow...

sorry for any inconvenient, I try to recover slow and keep my self on the trill, without so many parties...and you know, when you see me celebrating on asia, please give me a word remembering that fear night!!

thank you

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Yeah, ok. How are we supposed to track the performance of the "strategy" when you go rogue trader on us and start trading 400:1 leverage on different signals??

Xandi's "mysterious" pyramid is a PYRAMID SCHEME. It's right there in the title for you. Never trade this strategy as it is an account blow up waiting to happen. Xandi has failed to address the obvious tail risk here.

Rule #1 in risk management is to mitigate the risk of ruin. Xandi instead makes short term profits by amplifying the risk of ruin. It's like selling deep out of the money options. Sure works great for a while!

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
man, give me a break, while I traded strictly by the rules, weeks&weeks, I´ve already shown you the potential and how to trade, I´ve written down the strategy summary and the leverage rule, follow it if you want, don´t follow me...

after that, my account is own my responsability, it´s your task to separate the wheat from the chaff...you want free trainning and a perfect account to teach you and you to follow all the time?? go knock "goldman sachs" door....

and by the way, remove the word "scheme" because it´s unworthy and dirty trick..

Have fun selling out of the money options. One day when your account is gone you'll see I was right. It seems like you don't even know what "black swan" means...

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
You still haven't addressed the ludicrious tail risk in this strategy. How many times has the AUDUSD gone 300 pips without retracing 90 pips in history? You said "never" but have you done the backtest to confirm this?? Even if it hasn't happened before, that doesn't mean it can't ever happen. All I see in your profile are blown up accounts that confirm the fact that your strategy does have inherent tail risk.

Any risk manager (I'm one myself) would tell you this strategy is a failure waiting to happen. I don't need you to "teach" me as I'm doing my own  backtests. Yes, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, AUD/CAD, NZD/CAD all mean revert. That's the edge here. However, your approach is averaging losers and risking ruin.

I start to have few patience to stiil reply to you...I´ve told you in the past, read careful the 1st page, and you are not interested on that...so or you have an honest talk here, pointing things are they really are, or if you keep trying these diversion acts, I have to take some action:

strateggy summary:Only buy on oversold moments, when price is far away of ichcloud on higher TimeFrames combined...it means you are in oversold field, and yes, never occured a dropdown of more than 300 pips without needed retracement on that conditions!!! understood or want some painting chart??? The leverage I point in Summary, is 5:1 on 1st brick (90 pips gap)...and with that leverage, you can even hold a lot more than a DD of 300 pips.. by the way, smartass, if you are doing you ownbacktests, keep doing that at your corner, give a break here...only to give you an idea, the original strategy is running up on account SaxoTrader since 2008 with consistent profit, and there was not any "failure waiting to happen, or black swan"...

since you keep using dirty tricks regarding to my blown account on demo, or regarding this DD, when I clarified specialy to you it was OUT of the Strategy, starting for the leverage used on 1st brick, 400:1 (instead of 5:1), you are out of here...sorry, next time try to have a honest conversation, you can try to promote yourself but with honesty

I don't want to sound bad but it looks like You don't understand what I've wrote m8, if 26 pips today gave You 40% then You're still abusing high leverage, and thoose entries doesn't look like something planed and executed with that plan in mind.

Even if You are scalping then I'd not advice You to use such crazy amounts as it's an stright way to blowing Your account.

Even if You are pure technical trader as I am, You can't rule out someone opening it mouth about tapering for example and then an trade like You took will blow Your account in one second.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
bro,  of course I uderstand your words and deeply are in my veins!! it was an option the huge leverage yesterday, it was out of the strategye, but until I reach the minimum required balance on my accout to pyramidate in cruise mode, I will risk sometimes when I think (?) there´s less risk! once I am focus, once i´m without booze  , without changing side like the wind trading with PA or worst, I might do this (no more so leverage)....I appreciate a lot your concern, hoppefully soon I starting use again my usual levergage 10:1 on 1st position, no worries!

it doesn´t matter if you call a trader or not, you are so profitable and so coherent,  you are really shinning, you can call yourself a gardner,if you want !! you are surfing the wave of sucess!!!sunshine bro

f#$kkk!!! I missed my pending order by 1 pip...I didn´t calculate well the spread!! now I had to enter 10 pips above because of the slowliness of my htc...

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
was there on the line where I wanted to enter, using Price action Julexo, and I usually give 5 pips of deviation (spread included)...this time I missed

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
so.... 9032.....anyone surprised???? basis from price action pure, are you learning it already??

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
the leverage here was much more controled, 40:1 ... next days will be lower! imo, audusd has lot of room of rising up, soon I have time i´ll check it again and post charts!

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
Amazing recovery!

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
I like the term amazing!! but I have to admit it was not the best way, at least half way!!! many years only trading price action helped, but the best way is indeed the relax of a spiritual Pyramid!

next level can be perfectly possible at 8915...be aware of that, i´m aware of that!!! high probability, hold on bulls!!!!

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
and first will be 8962...can we do it there and jump off on BE???  im in, there!!

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
good morning folks!!

ahhh, I was already missing the good pyramid cruise mode!!!! I´m waiting 8906 to reinforce, but price can even not go there...let´s see...cheers

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
this is the monthly chart, 5 days until it close, and it is already on DOJI, it make sense, after 3 months of fall, to create a kind of bottom, it is has to be with doji...but too soon for price being already here, so we will see probably a shake of 100 pips up or down and after price will try to return here at the end of month...

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
Well done xandi! it sticks what you are talking about. I am long @ 0.90212 with 0,8 lot, so it is quite big trade for my account. I will wait to see green pips here with a lot of patient

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
last analysys, 5h tf:
IF this line was the neckline (it is variable depending on TF), we should count 90 pips ---> 8930 ( already reached????? )

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
0,8 lot ? or 0.08 lot?

last time I see you were trading with micro lot, below 0.1 lot...

bro, don´t suffer like me  !!!

...don´t forget to manage your leverage, 20:1 on 1st position is already far away leverage like I´m using now, but I still have lot of room to reinforces... it´s better you set your trade explorer (even if you put it in private) so you can control better your leverage!!! it´s easier!!! best wishes for us!

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
I lost one zero  It's 0,08, so I think I am safe here

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
ahhhhhhh!!!!!......

but good the posts above stickk!! I was missing to return to this peaceful trading!

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
Haha love your reaction

To be honest from time when I was encouraged by you to pyramid system I have never done anythink stupid. My the most risky trade now could be the less risky in the time before I met you with your strategy and all this rules from our 1st page

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Hi Xandi, A silent lurker here. I find a lot of merit in your strategy. I have used variable lots sizes as well but not constructed a Pyramid like you do. I will try to incorporate your strategy into mine. Patience and right risk management is the key. More profitable pips to you!

Am I blind or I see a W forming on daily chart aud/usd?

I´ll see that!!

entered on gbpcad...daily&weekly tf combined... ich cloud 600 pips below!!!!

ps: don´t know why, but the leverage on gbdcad is greater...with some lot, I have much more leverage used...watch out

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
Hi Xandi,

Best of luck, this what I had.

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
Hehehe! I saw your harmonic bro, just before open position! I saw the target already reached! Awsome work bro*

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
ahhh...guess my reinforce at 8905 was perfect...changed it last minute to 8886 and miss the entry by 10 pips!!

now Im babysitting this reinforcement 30pips above...even so, not bad!!

and that cad trade that is absorbing my leverage, even Im with small lot??

if I need I will have to close that!! good morning bro´s!!

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
I reinforced my trade at 8931. At the moment it is +3 pips in green. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
hey guys!! this is being a tough day, no?! lucky me that I was right in all predictions on gbpcad...

this audusd for some reason I have my reinforce at 8887, not triggered yet!! I had many chances to close it at BE, when combined with gbpcad...

and this morning also I had reinforce at 8905 and changed it...the most difficult part is to find the reinforcements balance equilibrium...it´s to find the point/level..we know we can reinforce on 45+45 pips, we have to know where, and for that I use the broke neckline...but sometimes it´s not easy to figure it...

ps: already regretting closed the gbpcad short from 6275...it´s going down...I hope audusd stop the positive correlation with gbpcad

ps2: the best still coming!

Hey bro they are missing a "special" smiley for parties...

P.S. I will have to talk to TWEE.....

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
thank you xandi ( and cool music ^^ )

with 5 levels i can hold a 450 pips movement in wrong direction but i must use little 0.3 lot approximately for first entry ,

so with 50 pips i win about 1% ,

to reach 100% i must make 100 pyramids ! it scares me enough i must say... :

that's why i've thought to make only 4levels ( and so, hold max : 360 pips ) but i'm more confident with 450

is there a problem you think in my way of applying the system ?

for eurcad we've broken the range H4 and i hope the price will bounce on top bollinger band on M30, if not, i will close

bro, you close the pyramid =>BE....there´s times you close >BE some pips, and it´s profitable...other time you hit TP on first position, you wait for retracement of +/- 50 pips, reenter, the money flows!

ps: bollingers? i prefer ich cloud and rules...

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
yes i think  i've well understood that mate

at each new level i'm changing TP  to be  BE ,

i'm using your 30/50/70 TP  to place my trades  ,

here i remove my TP of 30 pips and let the price go down because i was confident in the breaking of 1,40  and now i must find the best place/moment to go out, no ? that's why i use BB,etc .

if i'm wrong let me know, like that i can adjust my way of trading from the beginning of my pyramid

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
I´m not following the market now..when I saw it you could already booked profit...but are your first step...

bro, on the pyramid the standard is close it at BE...but some times you close it higher... you will experience that...you are only with 2 days of TE!

ps: until now you are doing great, seeing your TE!!!!

another typical buy the dip...I was writing to trailing buy again, this time to use 30 pips only on step, because the moove was sharp...I had no time to wright, and since I´m not trading today also, it´s better this way...nice catch pips to you all  bro´s..this moove will carry us to another high step, no doubts about it...

ps: on audusd it´s always better to wait a sharp retracement to enter on trade...how much sharp (fall of 30 pips on 1 minute), the better and safíest is to enter, on this stage of evolution of the pair...

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
S / R 0.90700 well respected by now if there is a close above 90700 can lead AUD / USD up to 0.91000/0.91010 next S / R.

hey bro, let´s try to not mix themes, don´t take me wrong...

I find harmonic pattern and ratios extremely useful but very difficult to draw, and easily mistaked drawed...i would like to have it here but only if they were precisely drawed, and there´s few guys I know who does that..Mr Scott and few!!!he usually post sometimes his charts here...

in other hand, I liked your notions on price action, but you were only talked about resistances so you can write only "Resistance" instead of "S/R"...

but other thing, you say if price "closes above"..but in which time frame? 15 minTF? if so I understand, it´s an option to trade on 15mintf, I like it, not bad for catching these 30/50 pips TP.

9010 can be the next level, but we don´t have to know much about price action, we know Audusd usually mooves 50 pips by 50 pips...the best thing still trailing buy step 30 pips...cheers bro!

bad trades of mine on asia..I´m a countrarian trader, I have difficults on catch this 100 pips all in one direction..I have to change this, because I knew the time was not for counter trade on audusd...

and after action started, I choose wrongly another pair..

About ucad what I noticed is that it doesn't give so many chances to trade as for example audusd, but if you see one it will give a nice profit. Rules from our 1st page about clouds and time frames work here excellent.

but...the size of account on this time conduced me to gamble..sorry, that´s the way things are, I wanted to reach at least 1000 to start openning positions of 0.1/0.2 LOT on 1st entry and follow the interval gap of 90 pips...thats the minimum I will trade in the future, and that´s the minimum it pleases me...so as I went having problems mading the deposit initial because of paypal, I just keep rising and rising account. and told everytime and everyone I was overleverage, 60:1 on 1st trade, not respecting interval gaps, and not even catching the 30/50 pips standard TP...and also, why I longed eurjpy, was oversold on high time frame?? I did not even saw that..gambling...

...obvious it going to go wrong!!!! wasted month....

all the best bros..going to give a break! .. and return this time with only automated by the book trades!! this time will be so!! thanks for following another month to reach 300%, and to wtch the dive!! at least I still had the swimming googles and flippers from the tsunami missed yesterday!!!

take care friends

joking bro, but really thanks for your help, amigaoo!  ..I just only pitty that my trade explorer this month does not honoured the Pyramid Manuscrit..I looking forward to trade only with automated pendings and TP, with EA , change the account to instant execution, and whatever happens, never disrespect again the leverage rule!!! that´s my resolution for next challenge!

discipline & patience (Patience = trade with all automated orders, TP and pendings, all the time, without emotion, without being watching the market everytime)...

Next trading plan should start by a check up at MM in my humble opinion.

I've programmed a dashboard indicator for Xandi's mysterious Pyramid system. It displays the pip distance of the selection of pairs you choose to

the Ichimoku cloud in H4 and D1 time frame, so you can spot good trade opportunities more easily.

The parameters are easy enough to understand - I think. Just add the pairs you want to watch in the "pairs" parameter

and separate each with a ";" - don't use spaces. If your brokers uses suffixes  (e.g. EURUSDfx), the suffix ("fx", "m") will be added automatically.

Don't consider the default pairs in the indicator as a recommondation!

I hope, somebody finds this helpful

Chris

Thanks so much Chris. This will come in so handy. I will test it out over the weekend

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
too bad. you lost your live account. at least, you learned something.

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
Hi Xandi

Sorry about the account loss.We learn most from our mistakes more then from our successes.

If I may suggest trade with limit orders and this way if they get triggered then you have a great number if not then you are too early.

Think in swing way.If you catch a great trade twice a month you can consistently hit 10% a month.You you just compound that 5yrs you will be surprised.

Regards

welcome back!, always following ur thread. I had 2 previous successful months with the pyramid in demo, now I am going for the third month, but i am using a lower initial Lot, and different entry point.

Good Luck this time.

whats happened to xandi?? come back!!

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
Heyy bro´s!!!!

still on testing and I have good news for you, bad news for me!!!

My bad news is that I overleveraged again on eurjpy and went wrong again...i was able to rescue something, but my net balance on both live accounts here is -210 €

the good news is that I´m going to combine and start trading based also on Bollinger Bands, on 5h TF.

So I´m going to trade in this way, start pyramid with CORRECT leverage counter trade when price reach the bollinger bands...have to think in a way to combine with the rule of approach to ichcloud...

but...when bollinger bands up and down are too close eachother(less than 100 pips on eurjpy), I will not trade based on pyramid, I´ll follow the break of the channel and follow the trend(at least 200 pips on eurjpy)...

on the other situation, I will always use pyramid starting on the bottom or top of the bands...

..look at the example, it´s easy to understand!!!

I will activate my Trade Explorer when I finnally have the deposit funds balance I want, it means at least 1000€ so I can trade with position 0.05 / 0.1 Lot safely, respecting Leverage rules... keep well my dear friends, and have a nice weekend!!!

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
thanks for the update. i thought of using bolinger bands when someone else mentioned them. good luck my friend!

--- 帖子 #1209 ---

my target is 134.00

like said before,i´m trading on bollinger, 5 hour, on the approaching to ichcloud,and giving special attention when bands are separated by less than 100 pips

risk managment  is the key, keep it simple

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
I´m changing my pending sells, 1st level reinforce is at 135.50, it´s easy to see it with bollinger...

also you can see why I jumped off initially at 134.60, I expected a retracement for this fall on the middle band, and it happenned....!!!

chjungen!!! nice too see you bro !!!

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
broooo!!I just checked how´re you doing and I want to congratulations to you!! nothing new, you were already consistently profitable before I left for while,and you still are in awsome shape!!nice too see you friend!! looking forward to follow and share a path together!! cheers and "abrazo" !!!

thanks Chris! very nice to see you again!!!another journey begins, and it´s warmful be sided by friends!!

looking forward bro!!

ps: traders,watch out when BB upper and down are only separated by less than 100 pips..I´ve explained before, and now it seems be the case..aalso, the ichcloud is below, so I won´t dare long this eurjpy when thinking on pyramid.

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
welcome back! we missed u!!

--- 帖子 #1227 ---
Xandi, can you please tell what grid pip distance and what lot-pyramid you use this time?

--- 帖子 #1228 ---
good morning bro´s, I miss you too !!!

ok, my grid distance is Bollinger on 5H TF (I know this is hard to set on MT4), with this BB set.

My pyramid trading still the same, only this time not too worried with only longing to approach Ichcloud...this time grid beetween BB, but still having in mind the main bias taking in cosideration the approach to ichcloud on high  time frames.

the other important variable on this trading BB is when upper and lower band became to close eachother, by less than 100 pips and almost horizontal lines...on that situation expect a TREND direction move almost 150/300 pips, so that time I will not Pyramidate.

the Lot of initial pyramid depends on each trader, I want to use the written leverage, I´m still finding my way, for now I´m using 1000€ --> 0.1 LOT on gap between 90 pips... like exactly the trade I have oppened...

On my present open trades I mislead and did not understood properly that BB was not close between or even not stabilized. but we should have the sufficient to hold on a drop of 300 pips or more.

From the shape of BB I´m expecting lower ban to become horizontal and also the upper band, so I think price will move between 136.00 and 134.50 next days...

Ive only tested this on EURJPY, extreme volatile pair! on other pairs I might prefer the old method without grid!!

cheers bro!

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
just in f"$% time!!when you see the maximum broken, in these cases, you immeaditily close the position..(for those who usually scalp (out of strategy))

now we can start recovering..

on both live accouts showed, indedd the psyhological on these scalp trades trapped me before, this time I was able to jump off, as soon the max was broken. i  don´t reccomend don´t like scalp,..

one EA for buy, other for sell..testing both EA

--- 帖子 #1237 ---
seems you've already burnt several accounts with grid/pyramide/martingale system

what'different in this one from each other?

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
hmmm...all them testing many styles, similar to pyramid only 1 or 2,  all of them on Demo and micro accounts... I was trying to find the best direction to enter the trade, with divergence and other indicators like bollinger..no great conclusions on that... I don´t remember following the written rules on 1st page... and using traling with help of EA, also did not that, until yesterday.

now Im using automated trailing buy/sell with pyramid on background, using EA, so as you can imagine, totally different, because humanily you cannot  do trailing as a robot does...this was my original idea and EA developed on that way, so lets finnally test it fulltime..

if you trade the right pairs, with low leverage scaling and position, is extremely difficult to be burned.

if you start with micro account 100$, and if you want to start living with its profits, you will risk a lot more and be exposed to burn off much more easily, obvious,

and if you do withdraw often , when you reach 50% and 100%, you can also burn someday your account beause you will be on high profit eitherway...

ps: despite that, this TradeExplorer is not the perfect example I want to share, specialy on setting parameters like gap on scaling, etc..because of that reason I still have the pending orders private..soon it will be normalized..

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
Hi xandi

I hope you are well.

For me your first system was the one to go with, but I think that some rules were missing or they were there and you were not following them.

I'm not judging you, you know that I did the same mistakes.

Clear rules/conditions to enter and exit and very important when martingaling, pyramiding, not use too much leverage on your first trade.

Now, I see that you have two open trades going over the week-end with too much leverage. If you have a gap on monday, this can just blow up your account. Think about it.

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
Hi Broke,

please, could you recap exactly all the rules you're talking about or when I can find it?

It's not a problem to me being disciplined if the system works and it is PROVEN.

thank you very much

--- 帖子 #1241 ---
Hi jimi,

It's all on the first post of this thread but xandi could certainly explain them to you better than me.

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
heheh nice to see you, ma friend!! i´m finnaly trading with the EA developed from the first idea..but this time Im only stress checking the trailing robot,,,of course  on live i will not trade with this leverage...i will compare this week also the results of this ea with other from xtilang and maybe another...and after I will give to this a properly month test also, following leverage rules and withdraw...
