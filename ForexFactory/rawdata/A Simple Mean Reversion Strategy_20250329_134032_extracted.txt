Today I would like to share what I consider, the most fun strategy to trade that I personally use. It’s simple, it works, and anyone can do it. Not only that, you can use it on any timeframe, depending on how much time you’d like to spend in front of the charts. Some people really enjoy spending lots of time on the charts, while others only want to check in only a few times a day to adjust their positions. Regardless of where you are on that spectrum, this strategy can work for you. Although, on the surface, the strategy is very simple and easy to get started with, I will be diving deeper into the inner workings of why it can work from a market structure perspective. With that being said… Let’s start with indicators. There is only 1 indicator that is required, and that is the 200 MA (Moving Average). This is what we consider to be “fair value” for any given currency. We know prices will always return to their “fair value”, so this is where we want to GET OUT of the market. When price is above/below it’s “fair value”, is where we want to GET IN the market. So the entry and exit rules are simple: If price is above “fair value”, we can sell the asset. We exit our shorts once the market returns to “fair value”. If price is below “fair value”, we can buy the asset. We exit our longs once the market returns to “fair value”. Beyond these core rules, you can season the strategy how you like for specific entries be it using price action, RSI or other indicators. I will share more on my personal seasoning later… At this point, most of you reading this are probably thinking, “This guy can’t be serious…” But, I can assure you, I am. Below are my own results from trading this strategy on EUR/GBP last month using the 1H chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The quick overview is, I have maintained a winrate of about 80%, I made on average 5.9 pips per trade, and my Value At Risk was -187. My median win is about 15 pips, and my median loss was about 20 pips. And this is how it looks month after month… There is one caveat to this strategy though… It will only work if you manage your account like it’s a real business that is buying and selling perishable products for profit. I will dive deep into this later but what it essentially boils down to is this, you need volume to consistently make stable returns. Not volume in size, but volume in deals. This means you must do 2 things: Stay Small Trade Often A short example to illustrate the point. Imagine a grocer who is selling tomatoes. Based on current market demand, they estimate they can sell $100 worth of tomatoes over the next week, and for every tomato they sell, they expect to make $1.00. But they have $3000 of cash. Their expected value of each tomato transaction is $1.00, so mathematically, why not buy $3000 worth? Even though they could try and buy $3000 of tomatoes to sell over the next week, the probability of $2900 worth of tomatoes going bad is so high, that it would be foolish to buy that much. The expected value of the first $100 worth of tomatoes is very positive. However, the expected value beyond that point goes straight to -100%, the further you go beyond it, the fast you eat up the gains from the first $100 of tomatoes. They have to stay small in tomatoes and use their money on other products. This strategy is the same way. There is only so much you can bet on any single position or leg depending on when you get in the market, if you go over that, you are removing the edge of the system by taking on excess risk that will almost surely not pay off, similar to the extra $2900 worth of tomatoes the grocer could buy. This would be a kin to planning your risk around the size of your mean or median loss. Now even though the median loss is very small, you can see the Value At Risk is actually quite large. It’s very important to know this because when you are thinking about your risk, this is the number you need to make all of your decisions around. If you used the median or even mean loss instead, you will take on excess risk that will almost surely not payoff, resulting in you losing money so fast it will make your head spin. Mainly because you will quickly find yourself way over-leveraged when drawdown inevitably hits. So when you are planning your risk, assume the risk of every position is the VAR, not what your mean or median loss is. This will keep you small, which will allow you to trade often. This is enough for the introduction. I will be posting my trades here going forward to provide a live example of how to use the strategy. I will also post deep dives into the areas mentioned above as time permits. This will include things like: Hidden Risk Estimating the rate of “inventory” perishing. Handling the portfolio like a business. Theoretical modeling drives the advantage of this strategy. And more!

As I dive deeper into the strategy, and post about trades I am taking, you will start to see some terms that it’s important you understand. The most fundamental ones are: Fair Value: This is what is considered the fair or true price of the underlying. It is the value of the 200 MA and it is what we trade around. Spread: This is the distance between the current price and/or your entry and it’s fair value. Premium: This refers to the positive spread of an underlying. When the spread is positive, the market is trading at a premium. Discount: This refers to the negative spread of an underlying. When the spread is negative, the market is trading at a discount. Theta: In option theory, this is the rate at which the option’s price declines over time. In our model, this is the rate at which the fair value is converging towards our entry or the current price. This is the rate at which our position will lose its premium or discount over time. Traditionally, Theta was used as a shorthand for the Greek word meaning death (Thanatos). Here is how these ones tie together as it relates to entries. As for when to entry, I will get very in depth on when, but to put it simply, you want to enter when the spread is large enough that there is a good amount of premium or discount, but not too large as this is often where the drawdowns will strike. This is also way you need to stay small and trade often. As you enter, you are trying to capture a premium or discount from the underlying’s fair value. This premium or discount is going to decay at the rate referred to as theta (the speed at which the MA is moving toward your entry). Theta is almost always working against you. As it does though, you will typically have the opportunity to average up. Never average down even if you can. Otherwise you end up like the tomato seller buying $500 of tomatoes when you can only offload a $100 worth.

Very interested! Following!! I really like the tomato analogy

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I think that the use of the word "spread" to describe a condition that occurs in this method will cause mass confusion, could be just me. Carry on, interested to see how it all works.

i'm in too, waiting more

Thanks for an interesting strategy.Would you be able to include charts and your buy or sell areas.Much appreciated.

Risk, Why is the price at the 200MA considered "Fair Value"? Is this what the majority of large traders and Bank trading desks use as a de facto baseline? Best, Dave

--- 帖子 #9 ---
There are different strategies based with return on 200 EMA, the problem is when the price does returns and it is a problem not yet solved. I am very curious to read about you and your strategy. If you know when the price will come back to the fair value, I guess that you have the holy grail.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
This is a great question Dave! And I'll explain below. I was also asked some similar questions by another trader that provide context around this answer so will share that below as well. His questions were in the quotes below. I use the 200 because I like the “speed” at which it trades and the size of the premium/discounts it provides. It’s also a very popular one that is commonly used by both retail and institutional investors alike. You could use any period you want though, the thing is, the smaller the MA, the smaller your opportunities will be. They will be higher in frequency but you need to weigh that against the cost. Vice versa for larger MAs. I also like the 200 for the reasons you mentioned, other people use it, so in that sense, you can have somewhat of a shared view on the market as a lot of retail and institutional traders alike. This is true, and exactly the point. Price itself is stationary, meaning, by definition, it’s “fair value” will move, relative to any period you are looking at. This is not a novel concept, but is the backbone of the entire option pricing industry. What is “fair” today, will not be “fair” tomorrow, and this will always be true. To improve your understanding of this, let’s look at how options are priced using the Black-Scholes model. All the black-scholes model does is essentially this. It takes the assumed distribution of the underlying, factoring in a risk-free rate. It then takes any given strike price and uses the distribution to calculate the AVERAGE payoff for all possible payoffs according to the distribution. It then discounts this payoff by the risk-free rate. The average payoff of today is not the same as tomorrow, this means the fair value of an option changes from day to day, decaying with Theta, just like our model. The options price over time is the moving average of all possible payoffs accounted for by the model over the duration of the option. Different durations result in different prices, from a mathematical standpoint, all are assumed “fair”. Does the fact that the option’s “fair value” changes day-to-day mean options can not be priced, sold, and managed by market makers? Our “fair value” is just like that of an option pricing model, it’s a theoretical value with the explicit assumption that all things will remain equal. Depending on the volatility of the market, the true price after the chips fall can be smaller or larger than what the model says is “fair”. Does this mean the model is broken? Not at all, all it means is, you need to understand the risk associated with the model’s error, and what conditions result in which direction the error occurs and it’s magnitude, as these are what you are actually betting on when trading the system. In options market making, and all options trading in general, its volatility… I’ll expand more on what they are for our model, but for now, I think this should answer what you are asking. I hope this clarifies the strategy/rational behind it for folks, and please post any other thoughts/questions you may have and I will answer as best I can. Will also be posting more about detailed entry strategies soon! Just need to find time to get everything clearly laid out between keeping the kids busy and getting stuff done around the house.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
These will be coming soon! I will also be posting charts with my actual entries this week as the market unfolds to show a better picture of how it's traded in action.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Just my opinion, but if I was to present an actual trading method, I would prepare all the documentation and charts beforehand.. Same thread and name on BP so not sure what you are selling but I'm sure it's coming...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Wanna bet on it?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I agree, and find it odd when people post a strategy and wait several days to post charts with clear entries...what's the point of this?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Oh guys... You are missing the entire point of the strategy by focusing on specific entries and waiting for some specific indicator that will give you them... And you wonder why most people lose at this game... They have no idea how the long-term winners actually play it... We aren't trading the specific entries, we are trading the price as a whole, oscillating around a modeled fair value while staying small and trading often, to benefit from model error... The MA in this strategy is strictly for modeling price, and using the model's error as your advantage, just like a market maker uses the Black-Schole's error in either the market's or the model's volatility assumptions to make money. By definition, if there was no error in the model's or the market's assumptions, you couldn't use it because the price would be truly fair at all times and there would be no reason for anyone to ever deal in it... If you are struggling to understand this, I'd recommend you read this post here: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14490815 You are like a grocer thinking about which specific tomato to buy... measuring them all against each other, trying to figure out which one is the "best". By the time you finish your measurements, they are all rotten... It's not so much about which specific tomato you want to buy, as much as it's about just buying the tomatoes when there is a high probability you can make a profit selling them at a "fair price". Most of the tomatoes are more than good enough. The ones that aren't are obviously rotten... The reason I haven't been eager to post specific entry methods beyond what's shared already is, it's really simple to find potentially good ones. This is what makes the strategy very simple to grasp on the surface, but as I mentioned in the first post, the power is in the inner workings as it relates to market structure and managing the trades. I could just post a couple of pics and call it a day. Another surface-level thread on here that provides no actual insight or discussion around the fundamental concepts that actually make people money... We could just throw it on top of the heap of all the other useless trading system threads in this forum... Sorry to break it to you, but that is not what I am bringing to the table here... If that is what you like though, there are a lot of other threads on here that should fit the bill! I will give you a little red meat though... I've already told you when you know the price is discounted or going for a premium via the spread. The larger the spread, the better. The higher your potential margin... Just like when you boil crawfish... Season it how YOU like... When the spread is large, the water is boiling... Here is some seasoning that I like. The RSI on default settings (14). I know I know, another top-secret proprietary indicator for Erebus to chew on . Not sure if he has heard of it before! Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you can't figure out which tomatoes are most likely be ripe vs which ones will be rotten by the time you can offload them in the picture above, knowing everything shared thus far, let me know and I will try and clarify it further...

"It's not so much about which specific tomato you want to buy, as much as it's about just buying the tomatoes when there is a high probability you can make a profit selling them at a "fair price". Most of the tomatoes are more than good enough. The ones that aren't are obviously rotten..." This reminds me of the M1 Countertrend Scalping Strategy. Hedging your bets that price will "eventually" return to its mean, but then we get into this on going debate about draw down.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
very interesting i supose the money management is the key

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Interested in following the thread and how to solve the mean reversion. About the MA200 I would distinguish two cases. 1 when the price returns to the mean. 2 when the mean returns to the price. Obviously case 2 is a problem when we find a trend.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Good thread.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
case 2 is the definition of Theta. The rate at which our potential for profit dies. It’s usually working against us (90%+ of the time). This why the size of the spread is important. The more margin you have, the longer it takes the theta to eat your position.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
And then I'll say the same thing again. 30% hard stop lol. And I was about to say that this reminded me of the M1 Countertrend Strategy as well, along with the Hedging Averaging Strategy.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
hey brother 30% feels steep haha, that’s how you guys do it over there??!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
@Riskcuit Interesting thread but I must confess I've got lost. How to calculate theta and all other probability parameters to make the right decision?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I’ve played around with this concept a lot, the theory of trading back to the 200 ema as mean and found a profound way to spot ideal times in the market when this would be most effective. I can share if OP permits.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Nice thread, RC. How would you go about identifying the ideal "spread"? Finding the percentiles is easy enough, but how large is too large?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Sounds like some seasoning I and I can imagine others wouldn’t mind hearing. Please just keep it in the context of the thread.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
That’s a great question, however, I want to note, there is no singular “ideal” spread. It’s a dynamic position that you are adjusting/building into. there are “non-ideal” spreads as mentioned earlier though, and it’s when spreads are small. We need to remember the spread is our potential profit, and it is usually decaying/shrinking. Because of this, you don’t want it to be small. Additionally, if you enter in really small spreads, the larger your VAR is, because when the market makes a run away from its “fair value”, which it will, you are closer to the beginning of that move. As a good rule of thumb though, the larger the better, but you can’t sit around waiting to play the deviations that only happen 1% of the time. I mean you could, but it’s boring and you lose a lot in opportunity cost. The reason the larger the better is because of how price is distributed. In a normal distribution, the probability of price touching a level in a certain timeframe is always 2 times the probability of price closing above that level in the same timeframe. Markets are not normally distributed though as I have posted about many times here: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...heres-the-edge ? the main thing is, it’s fat tailed. And an interesting side effect of this is, the probability of touching prices beyond a certain range is usually more than 2 times the probability of closing above them. That structural fact about how price is distributed is very helpful for us.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Awesome, this is just some personal seasoning, and some food for thought (no pun intended) I too think the RSI is very powerful in mean reversion systems. I use it in a different way however. Most traders look for reversals when the market reaches oversold or overbought conditions. If you study the RSI you'll actually see it bounce off important levels quite bit. Traders rarely use it like this, but there's a lot of hidden potential within it that can really highlight the current strength of trends of whatever asset your trading. I believe however, at least in in the short term, when the RSI can finally break through the Oversold or Overbought level (no bounce) there's a true sign of strength, and when you combine this with the idea of "fair value" you can really start to see where price wants to go. Here's an example...price breaks below the 200 EMA and starts trending downward for quite some time. If you notice - during this entire trend price doesn't break above the overbought level once (green line) - When it finally did cross, and when you take into account "fair value" it's evident that price will revert to its fair price or mean and you can take a position back to the 200 EMA. The problem with this concept is that the "Spread" will typically be very small in most setups, but you do get many trade opportunities. In the rare event price doesn't make its way back to the 200 EMA, then this is when you hit draw down and add another position at the next OS/OB level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks for the response RC, I appreciate it. I was wondering if you could elaborate more on this point actually: "not too large as this is often where the drawdowns will strike" - How you go about identifying this, if that's what you were alluding to.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Starting to build a position in AUD/USD with the 15 min timeframe. The current spread is about 50+ pips so we have some pretty good margin to work with. Theta is roughly -1/2 pip and is accelerating. It could accelerate all the way to 1 pip. In other words, our potential profit is decaying at roughly 1/2 pip per candle. This means it will take roughly 50-100 candles to lose it all depending on how much theta oscillates. When the trade moves against us, it accelerates, and it slows down when the trade moves for us. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will keep adding to the position as it moves down, but not super aggressively since the initial spread is so high. Deploying too much capital too quickly is just taking on excessive risk that can do more harm than good. Will post updates as it develops.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Makes sense to me , The arrow Indicator is basic RSI also

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Overall, not much changed last night. Had a pretty good run toward fair value but has since reversed. Theta has eaten roughly 10 or so pips of our potential profit but we still have a good amount of meat on the bone. Looks like the price will run further south so will probably add slowly as it does depending on how far it moves.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
This is a very interesting way to enter indeed. I think the biggest issue is it's sort of a single-entry kind of thing. It probably works, but the biggest issue is, the spread is very small on entries, so your theta risk is higher. You winrate is higher, but so is your risk. This is always the balance you are striking. The higher the win rate, the lower your expectancy is and the higher your risk (both var and theta). The higher the spread, the the lower your winrate, the higher your expectancy, and the lower your VAR and theta risk is.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks for the clarification. I understand that the entry is looking for a point at which the spread rises and with RSI in an overbought/sold situation, with this a large number of occasions may be in profit. But what requirement or idea does he use for a second or more entries in case the benefit is consumed by Theta?, understanding that he maintains open positions and looks for the average of them until he leaves with a profit as a whole.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Guess the term "Spread" in this thread means something else than normal meaning in trading

--- 帖子 #36 ---
You will want to read this post: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...1#post14533611 I'll be introducing some additional terms soon as we keep building on the initial concepts.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Do you calculate all these probability values manually/auto before making the decision to enter or you just eyeball the charts to have a decent estimation of their values?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Out of this position now. Starting to build some in AUD/NZD, GBP/NZD, EUR/NZD, and USD/CAD

--- 帖子 #39 ---
They don't. I do because i use riskier money management.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
So the system works with a $100 account and doesn't work with a $1,000,000 account? Or is there any value how big of an account do I need for 1 lot trades? "I will dive deep into this later but what it essentially boils down to is this, you need volume to consistently make stable returns. Not volume in size, but volume in deals. This means you must do 2 things: Stay Small Trade Often A short example to illustrate the point. Imagine a grocer who is selling tomatoes.

Here i applied Zig Zag and it has more neater entries !!!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Due to high correlation between EUR and GBP, this strategy could work. The hard part is to hold your trades when the correlation breaks. The money management is particularly important with this strategy.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
A statistical look at the spread (gap) vs theta (speed) would be interesting. Data can be analyzed daily, weekly and monthly. Max gap, max speed, max acceleration. Avoiding entries when SMA Slope is accelerating could improve the system.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
For 99% of people, it will work on any account size depending on your broker. Smaller accounts will be harder depending on your broker because you will probably be forced to take on more risk than you should. Oanda is the only broker I know where size (on the small end), won't affect you because they will let you buy/sell literally a single unit of currency. If your smallest lot size is 0.01 (1000 units), you will want to avoid small time frames, and definitely won't want to enter while spreads are small. We always hit bad runs where our first few entries are DOA, so if you go too big, too fast, it will be really hard to offset the early positions.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
ZigZag repaints so it will look super good after the fact but using it in the present can be dangerous.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I like how you think! Lots of stuff similar to this will be coming down the pipe soon! Wish there was more time in a day haha

--- 帖子 #47 ---
it’s a pretty logical concept - if price can reach over bought conditions (extreme trend strength) while below the 200 EMA - then price was very oversold - and a natural rebalance to fair value is due - safe bet this is using Ema based rsi on a length of 8 i will delete if this doesn’t align with OPS concepts Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yes the Repaint Nature of zigzag is the strength because rarely zizzag obey its first leg, the zizzag indicator i used just prints me the repaints prints, so all eyes on the first print , as shown in this pic

--- 帖子 #49 ---
It's a good entry method for returns you may want to add to but again, the size of the spread and the goal of going for a very high hit rate can be concerning. Mainly because we don't want to assume any one entry will be profitable, as this will cause us to take on too much risk for that entry. You really want to assume the opposite. The smaller the spread, you should assume there is a higher probability of this entry going into drawdown than if it was larger. And the smaller the spread, the larger that drawdown can be. You want to stay small, know that you are likely to hit drawdown, but you are small and ready for it so you can build your position, and average down your entry, rebalancing the position so it will be profitable once it returns to fair value. This is also why we use a MA, because at some point, the price has to return whether or not you are in the money so you technically can't average down to infinity. There are a lot of ways you can approach the averaging down, and I will share how I typically approach along with the data on why I use this approach later. Currently working on the best way to illustrate everything I have talked about previously regarding using models, knowing their errors and how we take advantage of that. Then will dive deeper into managing averaging down in addition to the concept of "rolling the trade" (essentially the same concept as rolling over your strike or duration in an options trade).

--- 帖子 #50 ---
As long as the re-painting is clearly acknowledged and accounted for, I like the seasoning!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Interesting idea to start small and with decent spread, in hopes of moving back to MA 200. You should post how you managed that AUDUSD long trade, entries and exit.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
This is exactly why you need to stay small. Additionally, is why you don't want to take every entry signal. You need to weigh the risk. The 2nd and 3rd entry signals mark, provide almost no reward to taking on the access risk... If you were using a fixed lot size so would triple your risk on those entries for almost no cost average advantage. This will only make it require more capital to cost average in the future. After your initial first entry, you don't want to add to the position till the spread between that entry and the fair value is essentially 0 or negative. The only reason you ever take on more risk is because it significantly increases your POP. If it barely moves the needle, it's almost certainly excess risk that will not payoff.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
thanks for the reply, I guess my brain is stuck on the other entry model of trying to produce the highest strike rate possible while protecting the account from as much DD as possible. It’s a fundamental shift from how I trade and would have to re program my brain haha i may open another thread that looks at this methodology - thanks for opening my eyes to different way of viewing the market

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Yeah, it will probably be a pretty big change for a lot of people who try it out. It's like that by design though. We aren't trying to "snipe" entries, but instead are playing a larger game and letting CLT do the work for us. This is also why it's important to stay small and trade often. If you don't, CLT can't kick in, even if you have a strategy that is +EV mathematically. The trading should also be very slow and calm if that makes sense. Even when you are in a bad drawdown. If you're small, it shouldn't matter too much and should be relatively easy to trade out of/offset with other occurrences in other products. All you are doing is managing risk while letting the model, and it's assumptions and errors drive the profits.

How did you judge to skip marked entry points 2 &amp; 3? Is there an objective way to determine it?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Explain your meaning of calculation and use of fair value for AUDUSD or give other example or ""Forever hold your peace"

--- 帖子 #57 ---
please re-read 2nd post in thread. Fair value is ma. Spread is distance between current price and/or entry price to fair value.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
yes, I pretty much explained it above. The pip distance between those 3 entries is all very small. Theta would eat up that distance between each candle pretty quickly. Additionally. If you add there it will be more capital intensive to average down later on should market continue to drift against you. it’s not with the risk as any increase of potential profit from averaging down will be quickly eaten by theta. This is why you typically don’t want to be adding until there is basically no potential profit for your first or average entry price. It will protect you from trading too aggressive and keep your risk small so you can weather the larger moves.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Your first entry on AUDUSD was 50 pips below Fair Value, does next entry needs to be 100 pips below Fail Value? Can you quantify when it is beneficial to enter the next trade? Do not "theta us " , just explain 2nd entry as it relates to AUDUSD chart.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I did explain it, but may be easier to show it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I said: "This is why you typically don’t want to be adding until there is basically no potential profit for your first or average entry price." I have marked the same entries but have added a horizontal line showing where first entry would be. Once the MA crosses the horizontal line, the theta has eaten up the entire profit opportunity for the first entry. Notice how on entries 2 and 3, if price returned to fair value, the FIRST entry would still be profitable. There is no need to add risk on these entries because you will be paid off for current risk should fair value returns. This is also the case for the 4th entry, but the profit would be tiny, so that would make sense to add there. And for the 5th entry, if the price returned to fair value, the first entry would be a net loss at that point (theta ate the entire opportunity). There is no need to add excess risk if you will be paid out should price return to fair value... Adding the excess risk at entries 2 and 3 would reduce your cost basis by nearly nothing. By strategically averaging down, you can extend your potential profit and defend against theta.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Following your thread with interest, RC. I noted that in your first post you mentioned that "Theta is almost always working against you. As it does though, you will typically have the opportunity to average up. Never average down even if you can. Otherwise you end up like the tomato seller buying $500 of tomatoes when you can only offload a $100 worth." - You mentioned about averaging up, but so far we've only seen discussion around averaging down. Do share your thoughts on this when you have time. Cheers.

thanks for pointing this out! This was a typo, was probably thinking about being short so we would be cost averaging to raise your average entry. you never add to a position when it would move your average entry closer to fair value.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thanks for clarifying RC. An additional question - What are your thoughts on lot size as your add to your entries? (Same lot size vs increasing lot sizes as your scale in)

--- 帖子 #64 ---
This amazing strategy will work for crypto pairs via spot trading with no leveraging , i think so !!!

Well I have been using this strategy for about 6 months. I have actually seen videos of KOF on youtube and made a research myself . I have found scientific researches which are made over price actions of many asset group including stocks,fx, commodities etc. It has been proven that the market returns to median. In this case median is calculated by everyone differently. After screening many different time frames I have seen that it works best with 1m and 5m. I have seen during my trading days during last 6 months that you have to adapt this strategy everyday based on market news, volatility and sentiment. On data light days, the deviation from the median is about 10-20 pips. It can be extended till 50 pips. On important data days deviation from median is generally between 50-100 pips. In this case you make your plan and your risk management accordingly. %99 works and %1 human error . Lost no single trade for the last 6 months thanks to this strategy.

It doesn't work like that. You add a new position only when the EMA 200 absorbs all the profits from the first position.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
@Riskcuit How do you manage situation like this?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Below are max spread (gap) between SMA-200 and price action over a period of 3 to 8 years on different pairs. I hope this data can be useful for the system users. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Edit : updated image to correct figures. Values are in pips.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Yes, I believe so, whenever you "build" your position, you are adding risk and moving your entry further away from fair value.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I think that is the one minute, mean reversion strategy being played out, as promoted by the "King of Forex" on Youtube etc. His idea of "fair value" is the 20MA I think and ultimately the 50 and the 200 depending on price action. Risk managed by only adding a new position when an MA catches up with the previous candle.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Wouldn’t it make more sense to short when the average price is getting smaller or in other words when the 200 MAs slope is negative? So you could have shorted that spike for example.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
enjoying the thread thanks Riscuit I am wondering what kind of return on account do you get doing this since you can only risk bits at a time ,?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hello abokwaik, May i know where you got this data? Any chance you can share, would like to conduct more research on this. This helps alot in opening reversal trades, managing risk and controlling lot size Thanks,

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hello all. I would like to share my thoughts on this subject. I believe that the most important factor in having success with this strategy is the spread (in the way that RC described it). In order to open a position the spread must be at a minimum price. So you would ask how can soneone decide about what this minimum should be. I would calculate it based on ATR or in percentage of price change. Otherwise I would calculate the maximum spread during the last x candles and the minimum spread that I must have would be a percentage (eg 95%) of the maximum calculated spread. Adding RSI indicator to these criteria would potentially increase the possilility of win. But there are so many other factors that are of very high importance in order to create a winning strategy like where to put the stop loss, take profit, trailing SL. Would you close the orders in a certain lvl? (eg if RSI goes to 50)? Many questions that only programming and thorough backtesting could answer.

EURUSD Daily almost back to the 200MA. Not a huge loss from theta (rising MA) after its little excursion. Around 100 pips, assuming it continues on its merry way! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #79 ---
You need to enter in chop conditions. So the speed is important. The faster it hit the minium "spread" the better. Dont want a long slow trend.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi, I made a bit of stats on A/U H1. Nothing very surprising. - The max gap is approx. 1200 pips (8 oct 2008). - Theta is correlated to the spread. This makes sense because of the lag of a moving average (distance to the MA is the trend times the lag). - The curvature of the ema200 is also proportional to the spread. Also makes sense since an EMA corrects proportionally to the distance. From this you easily conclude that the safer the less premium and vice-versa. A tradeoff would be to take a trade when the spread is wide but the slope is decreasing; what numerous traders would call divergence trading. I also made some stats on the swings. Again no epiphany. - The contrarian swings a slower and shorter than the swing with the trend. - The most likely speed of a contrarian swing is ~5 pips/bar. (not the average because the histogram is skewed) - The most likely move of a contrarian swing is 50 pips. This implies that a bigger spread will most likely not be recovered is a single move but a zigzag. Using this stats one can project (blue dotted line) the EMA200 (black) and project (orange arrow) where the price and EMA200 should meet then draw the expected price (green line). I added a few orange arrows rising 5 pips/bar over upswings to show how good/bad the approximation is. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The indicator below plots the distance between the MA-200 of EURUSD and the MA-200 of GBPUSD. I've added Bollinger Bands to it to observe when the distance is "high"... here are some entry points.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Good thread RC.if there are statisticians.......for example, what is the probability on AU after a spread of 100 pips to retrace 20 pips? look for interesting proba then trade if proba is for us

--- 帖子 #83 ---
You could use this signal but there will be very few entries overall. Also, the goal isn't to have "sniper" entries for scalps. It's to manage risk and be paid for it over time through a large number of occurrences.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
EUR/GBP setting up nicely to start building a long position.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks for dropping in PipMeUp! Have enjoyed a lot of your work around the forum in the past. That is correct, the "safer", defined as a higher probability win rate, the less meat on the bone there is to capture. This is built into anything that has a distribution that is remotely similar to a normal one. The larger the spread, the lower the win rate, and the larger the reward.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Let me get this straight. The strategy rules are: 1. Price needs to be away from the 200ma by a x number of pips (adequate "spread") 2. RSI or Oscillator of choice needs to be overbought for SELL and oversold for BUY 3. Only average down when another signal is generated AND 200ma passes through previous entry 4. Exit at return to 200MA or other money management techniques. This can be somewhat easily coded and tested.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
@Riskcuit ,what is VAR? value-at-risk? what is its importance ? how do we calculate?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
VAR is the max you can lose at any given time. You use a MAX value instead of an average/median and assume it's going to happen. It's important to keep your sizing small and adjust it as you add to your position.

I can write the code for this strategy if you like in mql4. But now I am in vacation so I will be able to write it in a few days. Also we must discuss about the stop loss levels in case the trade/s go against us.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
No SL as you are averiging down

--- 帖子 #93 ---
As soon as we see at least 50 pips spread/deviation from MA, I started and continue building long positions.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
If I have several entries losing, I would look for a higher TF liquidity point to add. The RSI since the downtrend began is indicating oversold with possible entries...

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Like, how do you guys get several entries losing? If you follow the "only re-enter when fair value hits your first entry", you get just a few entries. I been backtesting this strategy with my stuff and the max open trades I had was 3, on the 1 minute chart, having, on average, a profit factor of over 2 each month. It's mad crazy, if you follow the rules. If you start averaging down every time the rsi goes OB or OS, you're done. And yes, I use RSI for my testings.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
It was an idea as a possibility, I have not tested the system yet, but I think that being able to get out with profits is as it says, letting MA reach the first entry before averaging

--- 帖子 #97 ---
And don't trade after red news (if you trading the 1Min). Almost everytime sets up a huge trend that causes drawdown.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Did you use any filter for the first entry, such as a certain separation, price action, etc, in addition to the RSI? And once he had two inputs, would he let the 2nd MA reach his level to average a 3rd?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
ATR bands on the MA and only buy when below them (vice-versa for sells). Only trade during certain hours and not the all day. Once i enter, I either wait for the price to return to the FV or the FV coming to my entry. If the FV, comes to my entry and the price in below (buys) the ATR bands, i enter again, adding, let's say, 0.01 lots to my size. Then I wait, and I keep doing this until it gets out on the 200 ema. Some setups will be a loss, but mostly are wins. So far, on average, 70% win rate, with close to 1:1 average win/loss, which is great.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
The core of this strategy is really good, specially the re-entry rule, which saves you a s**** ton of drawdown.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
OK, thanks for the answer in detail, I'll try it and show you in case I'm not doing something right

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I remember having already tested something similar with my mid-priced robot, I did some tests here and it passed so far I think for this test period, if you have any ideas I can try to test it but I have little data history Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Yeah I can code this in MQL4 as well or at least, i should be able to. I would put in a Global TP and Stop as additional money management options. This would be better suited in MQL5, though, since backtesting is so much nicer in MT5.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Didn't @Riskscuit mention a VAR (Max Loss) instead of just relying on the return to the median when in drawdown?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I would welcome ea to be done with mql5 and will run optimization and test it on mt5. I been live trading on MT5 for the last few years, it is great. I suggest we have input field for the least amount of pips allowed for deviation for the first and next entries.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Deviation will definitely be an important input as you would probably need to optimise this value for different pairs and timeframes. Along with the RSI period and timeframe. Typical money management stuff in an EA of this sort would include number of averaging entries, martingale and how to exit (exit at MA or global TP/SL). I should really get my ass on converting to MQL5.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
If you are adding at all those lines I hope you are staying small, otherwise DD could kill you.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
You shouldn't have added until theta ate up nearly all of the original opportunity. I will post about rolling soon to try and get out of rough spots.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
This guy gets it! This is why I didn't want to get into "entry signals" at the start, people go crazy and just want red/green lights to click the buttons. It's also why the entry is open to personal preference. RSI is just one flavor of seasoning for those who need a hard/fast rule to pull the trigger. But don't get trigger-happy with it! Manage the trade properly and don't take on excess risk if you don't have too. It's all about managing the trade...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
What is your approach for the subsequent re-entries? That's the missing piece I'm hoping to hear from RC as well. Even if you scale in when MA has breached ur original entry in subsequent trades, you will still need a min. distance between each re-entry to avoid a cluster of too many open trades.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Based on what i've read on this thread, there are 3 conditions to fulfil to add the next entry: x number of pips from MA RSI in OB/OS level MA breached previous entry Riskcuit also mentioned a VAR which is basically max stop. I assume its a global equity stop like 10%.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
yes. Even with these 3 criteria met, without a min. dist. between each trade can spell trouble. U can run a backtest to see what I mean. I guess for now I'll wait for RC to get into the details

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Indeed, indeed. Rule of thumb I'm using is: price need to be lower (buys) or at least touching the atr bands of the 200 ema for my re-entry. If it doesn't do both and go for FV, just take the L.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
for the re-entries if you are using x distance from previous entries than will become normal grid that can lead to high DD.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
On a 4000 dollar investment you get 669 dollar and 50 cent, over a timespan of 7 years and 6 months. Yup, time to give your boss the finger and finally quit that day job.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
In the meantime, 2nd and 3rd entry are in profit and most likely the whole position in profit.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
It is similar to this what you use Baiao1906. I imagine that you configure the atr multiplier depending on the pair? The way the price is relative to the channel, would you make an entry? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Only use EURUSD and trade it from 9 am to 12 am UK time. Would have had 2 entries this morning, both of them profitable. Your bands should be tighter tho. Filtering entries that much would cost you a ton in opportunity cost.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
More like this. Red rectangles are the entries.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Feel free to show results with a risk based lot setting instead then. abokwaik and PipMeUp even showed the max gap/spread historically. 1200 pips (2008), need to be able to bleed some money if you scale up. How much are you willing to bleed money wise before you hit that stop button?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I don't think these ideas are what @Riskcuit is going to present

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I understand that it enters when the price re-enters the bands, through the marked box. I have the ATR by multiplying x 10 And in case of 2nd entry, let MA return to the level of the 2nd to make a 3rd entry?, increasing the lotage in each one, for example: input 1: 0.01 input 2. 0.02 input 3: 0.03...

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Thanks for the answer and details.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
It just work in progress, it is interesting concept, but definitely needs optimization and backtesting of at least 500 trades before I even consider going live. I do like expansions(hello FireScape ) and reversions techniques.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Well, not like i'll be doing $200 at 0.01 lot if i know that the max DD is $145 from statistics. If I use $1000 for 0.01 lot then i'll be getting an average of about 7% per year (per pair, i have more figured out =P) I will then set my equity SL to a max of $200 which is 20% risk. The probability of hitting this SL is extremely low and has not happened for the last 7years. And duhh...max gap spread are very different depending on MAs, Period and Timeframe. Heck why am i even bothering my time here. I'm gonna delete my previous posts. Not really feel like sharing anything anymore. bye bye

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hope it all works out for you.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I have another thought about this strategy. Since there will be a theta loss, why don't we trade it on two timeframes with a straddle to make up the theta loss? It's like "gamma scalping". Two opposite positions still could be managed as always. Nothing's changed but we might have less theta loss. Either leg's profits could cover opposite leg's theta. One thing's different from gamma scalping is that we add positions to deviate from delta neutral. We close a leg and build a new leg to become delta neutral. It's just an idea that needs to be proved in practice. But is it theoretically correct?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
A very hard DD management is when you meet a trend like this. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Yep, something that can be misunderstood about this strategy is, it's not supposed to be some 100% win rate martingale type system. There will be losses. The larger the spread you use to enter, typically results in lower win rates but higher expectancy, which intuitively makes sense because if the spread is larger, there is a higher probability the market is running, or in other words, a higher probability of theta eating your position BUT when it doesn't the payoff is larger.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Easiest way to play this system would be to scan for the maximum average distance from the MA, then trade from there. asw

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Interesting approach but will result in essentially little to no tradable occurrences so it will be very hard to see the benefits of CLT. Think of the 08 numbers posted earlier by abokwalk. If you are waiting for that distance to be exceeded, you'd have made 0 trades in 15 years...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
The main issue would be to discover the optimal values of spread and VAR in order to determine the best equity curve - in essence, optimising this strategy. An EA would be best suited for this. I should really get on it lol.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Not exactly Like in the picture above, the spread is not so high but DD is killing you because price and MA are raising in a parallel way. This kind of price action will not give you any chance to come up in profit. So, your money management needs to survive scenarios like that.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
This a long Saturday post to hopefully nudge you so you start changing how you think about trading. How to use a model and profit from errors... I have written about it many times in the past but never as clearly as I want to lay it out here and it's how to use a model in order to trade. Many people on Twitter will often post about "entry models" or "smart money" models but can't actually articulate what the model is. I am not saying they don't work, they might. But what I am saying is, they aren't clearly articulating what they are actually doing with the vague representation of the "model" they are trading. That also goes for nearly every thread of FF. To keep this post simple, we are going to look at the Black-Scholes model, specifically for pricing European Options. For those that don't know, a European option is simply a contract saying, after some amount of time, the holder of the contract has the right to purchase some number of shares or units of an asset for an agreed-upon price. A simple example of this would be a 60-day EUR/USD call option with a strike price of 1.11. Whoever owns this contract has the right to buy EUR/USD at 1.11 after 60 days. If 60 days pass and EUR/USD is above 1.11, the owner of the contract would be able to buy the shares at 1.11 and instantly show a profit from the difference between the current price of EUR/USD and their execution price of 1.11. Now that we understand what the option is, and how it works, the most important question to ask is, what is an option like this actually worth? This is where models come in, particularly the Black-Scholes model. The purpose of the model is very simple. Given a set of inputs, what would be considered a "fair value" for an option with those parameters. In this example, the parameters are: Probability Distribution for EUR/USD: Most economists typically start with a normal distribution. Risk-Free Rate: This is typically the interest rate difference between the 2 currencies. Current Price: We will use 1.09 in this post. Strike Price: As stated above, we will be using 1.11 Duration: In this case, 60 days. Volatility: This is typically the annual volatility for the pair, but you can really use any period. Now what the model does is, it takes probability distribution, and modifies it so that it accounts for the risk-free rate. It then calculates all of the possible results of the price of the EUR/USD using this assumed distribution over a 60-day period, using the given volatility. For all of the possible outcomes where the price of EUR/USD ends higher than 1.11 after sixty days, you take the difference between the final price and the strike price as your payoff. For all of the outcomes where EUR/USD ends below 1.11, you take 0 as your payoff. You then average all of these possible payoffs together, discount it by the risk-free rate multiplied by the duration of the option, and just like that, you have a theoretical "fair value" for how much you should sell or buy this option for. This is also the expected value of the trading activity that would manufacture this option (dynamic hedging). In other words, if you bought or sold this option a thousand times for this fair price, and all of the model's assumptions remained true, neither the buyer nor the seller would make any money because the price was "fair". I want you to re-read that last paragraph so it really sinks in. The main idea is, if your model's assumptions (or inputs) are correct, neither you or your counterparty will make or lose any money transacting. This is where risk and opportunity lie, in the assumption that your model's inputs are correct... Now in our model above, there is really only 1 main input that is a risk for someone using this model, and it's volatility. We know the current price with a very high degree of certainty, the same goes for the strike price and the duration of the option. We also have a relatively high degree of certainty when it comes to how prices are distributed. But one thing we do not have a high degree of certainty around is what kind of volatility EUR/USD will realize over the next 60 days. That is anyone's guess... Knowing this, think again about how we calculate the payoffs using the provided distribution and its assumed volatility. If volatility is actually higher than what we used in this model, the model's price for the option will be lower than what it is actually worth. This is because the probability of EUR/USD ending above the strike will be increased. If the volatility is actually lower than what we used in the model, the mode's price for the option will be higher than it's actually worth. This is because the probability of EUR/USD ending above the strike will be decreased. So even though a call option is inherently a long trade directionally, at the end of the day, it's actually just a volatility bet. If you are buying the call, you think the price you bought it for was essentially calculated using a volatility input that is lower than what you think the market will realize over the next 60 days. If you didn't think this, you'd be explicitly buying the option for more than it's worth. If you are selling the call, you think the price you are selling it assumes more volatility in the market than what you think will actually take place. If you didn't think this, you'd be explicitly selling the option for less than it's worth. In both cases, you are betting on the model being wrong, or the model having an error in regards to the volatility input. If you didn't think the model had an error, there would be no reason to engage in the market at all because every price you transacted would be fair. This is extremely important to understand. When you trade a model, you are betting on model errors as it relates to the inputs that are most likely to error... The point of any model is to calculate what some kind of trading activity is worth (its expectancy), in order to price it. You then need to understand which inputs into the model are most likely to be wrong, and in which direction they will be wrong. You then need to understand how these errors impact the expectancy of the model, and this is what you actually should be trading. The opportunities are in the errors. Everyone trading is doing this whether they formally recognize it or not. The problem is, they are betting on the wrong input for the model they don't even know they are using and this is why they consistently lose. Most retail traders are assuming the price will be more skewed in one direction or another if they use a certain entry signal, which is why they are either going long or short in a pair. So in their model, whether they recognize it or not, they are betting that the expectancy of a fair market, which is essentially transaction costs, is wrong because the market is going to go up or down via skew. They think it's higher than that using their entry signals. But in reality, you can assume with a high degree of certainty that the skew of the pair's distribution is essential right at or near 0 overtime. So if you are betting that the skew of the distribution will be well above or below 0 consistently over time using your entry signal, you will never make any money because that input is one of the least likely to error in the model they don't even realize they are using... There is also a bit of a fallacy in this line of thought because, if there was some signal that if used would consistently result in the skew being significantly positive or negative, you wouldn't need the signal because the "edge" would be built into the distribution itself. Thinking about trading MA crosses on SPY over the last 100 years... It's not the MA crosses creating positive expectancy for "trend-traders", it's the distribution itself. This is why timing SPY almost always will perform worse than buying and holding it. By timing it, you are actually handicapping the one thing that is driving your expectancy, the distribution itself.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I think what really could skew distribution or shift fair value are news and sentiment. Some old stats indicates that market only trends 20% of the time. In other words, most of the time fair value doesn't move much. So, 80% of the time trader should fade the extreme moves (model errors) and follow it when fair value is shifting. A trader once taught me "worry about your forecast first rather than your entry" which is opposed to what most retail traders do.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I have heard the 80/20 rule as well and have always found it interesting. for me though, I have always found it hard to determine what is a trend and what’s just a tail move in a distribution with no skew? Hard to tell the difference, at least for me. the skew is like the sample paths, in that even when it’s perfectly fair, it doesn’t mean that the paths are likely to have 0 skew it just means 1/2 of them have positive skew and 1/2 have negative skew.

Thanks for sharing, I'm new to Forex Factory and delighted to have found a community with so much helpful and valuable information and support. I've been trading for about a year and I think I've followed a pretty typical journey so far, initial low cost disasters, learned fast and improved a lot (or so I thought), enjoyed some amazing success, became overconfident, more much higher cost disasters, now cautious, treading carefully and determined. I hope it's Ok that I refer all the way back to the chart you posted on Aug 14. I'm able to replicate that almost perfectly, but I can see your RSI settings provide much greater clarity than I can see with the TV default settings. Do you mind sharing the changes you made to create the less noisy graph as shown on your screenshot? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
That's very hard to tell. For me, multiple timeframes analysis is analyzing a distribution within a distribution. A tail move with a skew must be a move that moves away from lower timeframe's distribution and affect higher timeframe's. If higher timeframe accepts the move, then it's not just a tail with no skew. The distribution is developing to left/right. And vice versa, if the higher timeframe rejects it, lower timeframe is a noise and it's time to profit from this model error like you said. When timeframes sync, the sentiment is strong and that's when big trends happen. But it's very exhausting to watch this in real time. What usually happens is m15 align with m5 and there's a opportunity on m1 but h1 is blocking on the way.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
@RisKcuit Thanks for your long post where the content is about option theory. How do you translate that into normal forex trading and the discusions we were having since last week?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
that’s a good question and I will explain when I get time to write another long post. the reason I started with explaining it in option theory is because everyone believed and knows market makers make money. they do so using the ideas in first post. Now that we understand how they make money using models, we can start to dive into the model of this strategy, find the parameters that are most likely to error, and how we can trade them.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
To confirm validity of this method, all you have to do is: 1. Create ea and optimized on at least 500 trades finding the best inputs 2. After finding best inputs, trade forward 500 trades with these inputs 3. Results forward trading will clearly show "Yey" or "Ney"

--- 帖子 #143 ---
the method of optimizing is a bit flawed. You can always data mine perfect parameters for a sample. But that will result will only stick it all of the inputs stay the exact same in the forward test… which they won’t. better to make a model, play with the parameters that are likely to change to see the effect it has. understand the impacts these changes have, and then essentially trade the errors of those parameters.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Good ideas but playing with parameters will only hinder and clout your ability to trade forward. I like to play with statistics because it is all you have. 500 trades of optimization should cover various market conditions. 500 trades forward will qualify or disqualify this method. I bet even after 100 trades forward, one will realize if it is a Go or no Go.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I think what he means is building a factor model and trade the mispricing opportunities. You surely can create a strategy based on the model, backtest it and generate lots of trade samples to analyze.

I wrote a simple Expert Adviser* following the basic rules from the first posts: - SMA200 - RSI14 - Scale-in only if SMA200 breached entry price of last trade - Close entire basket of trades when price crosses SMA200 On AUDCAD with a spread threshold of 60+ pips that gives the equity curve below (Monte Carlo analysis suggests a 18% risk-adjusted return per year): Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am intrigued by post #135. Indeed, you could simulate thousands of random walks based on historical volatility from the current price forward. This gives a "cone" that is symmetric around the current price. From that we can calculate the corresponding SMA200 responses and get a probability distribution that helps to judge whether it is wise to scale-in or to wait. Definitely something I am going to experiment with... *) No, I won't be sharing the EA here, because I have no energy at the moment for the usual questions after posting an EA on FF (e.g. how do I install, I am getting no trades, can you port to MT4, can you add this new feature, etc.). Sorry.

Can you please elaborate why you used these MAs rather than the EURGBP MA-200 versus its current price? It surely looks more smooth, but does it compare to @OP’s spread?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hello Yoriz, The indicator in question was developed by me some time ago with the intention of capitalizing on the positive correlation between the EURUSD and GBPUSD. Given that these two pairs ideally exhibit a positive correlation, my concept was to execute a strategy involving buying one and selling the other when a significant deviation occurs. In essence, this strategy can be equated to trading the EURGBP pair (Mean Reversion strategy). P.S.: I attached the indicator below

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Ah, I see. I just thought that perhaps you used a novel way of smoothing the "spread" using A/X - B/X instead of using A/B directly. Correlation trading is also an interesting topic, but not for this thread of course. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I see your point! Even though the thread isn't directly about correlation, I thought it would be prudent to mention it. Buying the EURUSD and selling the GBPUSD is essentially equivalent to buying the EURGBP vice versa. For this reason, it's essentially a matter of measuring the distance from the EURGBP to its ma(x) value. Here you can see the aforementioned indicator alongside an indicator that measures the distance to the moving average for current symbol (in this case EURGBP). They are pretty much identical.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I get that this is just a quick and simple EA with the basic rules. But if you would have traded this live and after 1-2 years you still don't have any profits, what makes you think you would have continued the strategy for another year and finally become profitable as the graph shows?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Good question. I have two answers to that. First, you never trade 1 strategy/setting, you trade a whole portfolio. Other settings or other symbols might already have given profit earlier. Here are some other symbols with the same EA: AUDCAD, 32+ pips spread, risk-adjusted return 88%/year (note the high deposit load!) Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURAUD, 131+ pips spread, risk-adjusted return 12%/year Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUDJPY, 104+ pips spread, risk-adjusted return 26.5%/year Attached Image (click to enlarge) Admittedly, the strategy probably needs a different tuning during 2020-2021, and only started to shine the last part of the backtest.* This brings me to the other answer: to do this properly, it is not wise to backtest like this. It is not hard to curve fit even a very bad strategy to show a nice curve. However, what were the chances you actually would have picked these settings a year ago? For example, see the " Myth of Averaging " thread for good examples of curve fitting random(!) strategies that still look good. Instead, you should run a Walk Forward Optimization that dynamically determines the best settings over small date ranges and uses that for the next trades. I am currently rewriting the EA to do exactly that. I will post once I have results. *) Yes, the backtest is only up to April. I never backtest until today's date and do all my tests and optimizations up to some "older" date horizon. Only right before I am actually going live will I run a last sanity check on the most recent data to make sure the strategy actually works and was not curve-fitted.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
You're pointing out several weaknesses with this strategy. First off we have the high deposit load you have on one of the tests. Even if the curve fitted backtesting show it can be done, you will never know in the future. Even with a walk forward optimization. When trading larger capital you will never get that high leverage, thus getting even higher deposit loads when scaling up. By using several pairs at the same time that are correlated you will crash and burn sooner than later. Of course you can pick pairs that are non correlated and get an overall better outcome. By using any form of martingale you will have the same bad outcome. Martingale will never be safe, unless you use some sort of stop loss. But then it will probably not be profitable anyway. By just using a 200 moving average as a mean reversion, you are missing important levels and micro/macro structures. The importance of fundamentals that usually can’t be programmed in a usable way. The lack of volume in forex that show hard traded levels and reversals. There are of course ways to get real volume for major pairs, but most retail traders don’t know how. Most people on this forum use Mt4, which is a flawed platform to begin with. Both trade wise and backtesting wise. It’s popular just because it’s rather easy to learn programming on and there are lots of indicators and EAs already done. Mt5 is much better, but still flawed in some ways. What I see here is just a retail dream. Maybe you will make this into a profitable EA, just don’t quit your day job in the process.

The real edge that a discretionary trader has over a systematic trader is trade management. Most discretionary traders like to set and forget but that's a fatal error. They literally give up their true advantage. This strategy works if you know how to manage the trade properly. Entry is always an easy part. If you want to do automated trading, you should focus more on trade management, too. It's a layer that rare people know how to do it. Here is an equity curve of a counter-trend strategy that I trade since April or May, 2020. For motivation only. EURUSD 2018 to July 2023. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

reading the market like an open book

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Note that I tuned the lot sizing of the AUDCAD backtest such that it exactly matched the dotted-line which is the Monte Carlo risk-adjusted return scaled at max. 35% drawdown at the 95th-percentile (which is just some arbitrary personal risk limit I use). It resulted in using 0.0831 lots per 1k equity for each entry or scale-in opened which is quite high indeed. When combining more strategies into a portfolio, the equity curve becomes smoother. This means we can crank up the lotsizes even more with the same risk levels. You are right that deposit load becomes a problem then. Can you please elaborate what you mean? The brokers located on tropical islands and in tax havens offer leverage up to 1:2000, but I don't want to deposit my hard earned money there. The better regulated brokers only offer 1:30 to retail traders unless you can prove you are a professional trader (which they say you can prove by trading large volumes ;-)). So that suggests that trading larger capital will actually give access to more leverage, not less. Absolutely! I think we are all looking forward to the next post of Riskcuit that adds more seasoning to the basic recipe. Not sure if this is relevant to this Mean Reversion thread, but yes, most trading platforms have their weaknesses. AmiBroker, Ninja, JForex, Zorro, etc. also have their problems. I have an Interactive Brokers account, but their trading platform feels like we are back in the eighties. No platform is perfect. As long as you know how it models the market and what it ignores, you can do useful backtests. I don't think there are many professional traders here on ForexFactory. This forum is targeted to retail traders (and their dreams ;-)). Most of us here should keep their day job, and do Forex trading as an interesting side job.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Depending on your accounts leverage and your brokers stopout level, 35% drawdown can be ok or risky as hell. Most people here are retail traders and have accounts between 1k and 5k. They cant open that many orders before they have run out of margin on a 1:30 account. Then again most people here strive at getting a high leveraged account in a bucket shop that allows them to overtrade. A couple of years ago the normal leverage was 1:500, new regulations made it harder for retail brokers to lure traders into getting to high leverage. Now the norm in Europe and Australia are 1:30. As you say, if you can prove you are a professional trader you will get higher leverage. But the higher leverage only applies up to certain amounts, then it gets lower again. When trading large orders there will be other factors that come into play, but nothing most people here will ever experience. Why I brought this up is that most people here will use EAs and do backtests on mt4, which will give false outcomes. Almost everybody in this thread are waiting for somebody to make an EA out of this strategy. And then the circus begins.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Taking the ideas from this post, let's extend them to this strategy... We will start with a very simple base model with the following inputs: - Price Distribution: We will assume a perfectly normal distribution for now. (0 Skew, Kurtosis of 3) - Current Price: AUD/USD Current Close - Fair Value: 200 MA - Volatility: Starting with the standard deviation of 15000 AUD/USD candles, we use this to determine the volatility for a price distribution of a series that is 150,000 candles long. So starting with our base inputs, our expectancy at various entry levels are as follows: Sample 1: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sample 2: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sample 3: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see a pretty clear trend emerge, this system gets beaten down pretty badly in a true normal distribution. In this case, you'd pretty much want to trade the opposite. But there are problems with taking this to the market in that way. The price is not normal. All of the sample paths above assume a Kurtosis of 3. The problem is, AUD/USD 60-minute kurtosis can often be as high as 13. Skew is basically 0. So in the model above, the input that is erroring when you apply it to actual market data is the kurtosis assumed by the price distribution. Because of this, here are how the same volatility entry levels look on the market's fat-tailed distribution. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Think about why the error in kurtosis would produce this result... I'll post why it does this later but want to see if folks can think about it and figure it out. To help, here is a visual aid of how this kind of kurtosis changes the distribution relative to a normal one (red line): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also, think about what increases/decreases in volatility would potentially do to this model...

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Because higher volatility leads to fatter tail. The hit rate of higher volatility entry levels increases and brings more profits when the market reverts to its fair value.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Essentially yes. Larger volatility means larger expectancy in terms of pips, not necessarily in terms of % of risk. Something I want to make sure is clear though, volatility itself does not lead to fatter tails. You can have low and high vol in a normal distribution. It essentially just describes the size of the distribution's standard deviation. Kurtosis is what drives tails to be fat or thin.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Another way to look at it, is to consider each M1 bar in the last years and measure how far price has drifted away after 1 hour, 2 hours, etc. Here are the stats for AUDUSD over the last 4 years showing the 1 sigma range (p16-p84) and the 2 sigma range (p5-p95): Attached Image (click to enlarge) So in 68% of the cases (=1 sigma), the price has not drifted further than +/- 40 pips away from the current price after 24 hours! In almost all case (95% of the cases) price has not drifted more than +/- 75 pips. The MT5 script below measures exactly this. Store the .ex5 file in the Scripts/ folder and just drop it on a M1 chart and grab a cup of coffee (might take a while...) while it calculates the statistics. It writes a .csv file in the data folder that you can open in Excel to make a plot. Attached File(s) yzPriceDistribution.ex5 22 KB | 180 downloads

So when price AUDUSD drifts at +/-75 pps, we can almost mortgage the house?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi Yoriz, This is a very nice work, congrats..... However personally I would never do calculations based on pips, only percentages. For example 50 pips on EURUSD when the rate is 1.5000 is totally different than when the rate is 1.0800... I often see that everybody somehow stuck on pips. If one is doing a calculation based on a day or a week than pips are fine. But when you are doing the calculations based on multiple years, pips are futile... My 2 cents...Good luck to all....

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Excellent point! Indeed, I generated the stats based on the last 4 years which is a long time. Below is the corrected version using percentage return starting at each M1 bar of the last 4 years going forward up to 24 hours. Note that I added the 3 sigma lines also to add to Riskcuit's point about Kurtosis and fat tails.

Glad you find it interesting! Just as it has been this far, nothing in this thread or system is secret, propertiary or sold by me. There is nothing to buy. Everything is and will always be clearly explained and given for free in the thread. And any questions will be answered!

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Here is my version of the same data but going to 4th sigma (red). Solid lines are reality and dotted lines assume a normal distribution. I think fat tail is clearly visible ;-) Also visible is the covid-19 effect on the negative 4th sigma Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note: I made the data using pips not %-age because it was way easier for the code.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hi Pip, incredible work as usual

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Same stats but for 2014-2018 to not include the covid period. Now the negative 4-th sigma is due to the downtrend of A/U over this period. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Great that you added the normal distribution for comparison! It is clear to see that price action is not a normal distribution. But now the main question: how can we benefit from this knowledge?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
beautiful chart PipMeUp! The tails are very easy to see here! The higher the timeframe the “smoother” the distribution will be. The lower the timeframe, the larger the tails will be. As kurtosis grows, most of the distribution will cluster more around 0 with larger tails further away from zero, The closer it is to 3 the more the distribution will snap into the normal bell curve. Kurtosis helps trading deviations from “fair value” because price is more likely to get much further away from fair value faster than it is in a normal distribution. And because there is no skew, it is also more likely to return faster than it normally would (chop up, and chop down) from these far off places. If you try to take advantage of the difference in the distribution from what is normal, one move at a time, it is very hard, it’s more about what effect these changes have at a cumulative level when trading. This is why you need to stay small and trade often to let CLT take effect.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
To continue the look at price as folks like PipMeUp and others have been doing, I want to share the concept of "fair value" candles. I have written about it in the past in my other thread regarding indicators and how when you use them, you are essentially just re-slicing the data to form a new type of candle, that is hopefully easier to trade than traditional candlestick. Let's take the opportunities in this system as an example. What we are doing by trading around the MA is we are essentially removing time from the equation, redrawing the candles using only the price itself and a theoretical "fair value". Even though time is removed, the candles are still similar to traditional ones in that we know the candle will always start and end. It starts when it moves away from fair value, and ends when it returns. What happens in between is anybody's guess... Below are some good visuals to show what I mean. First, we have the normal candle stick chart for AUD/USD 60min timeframe, looking at the last 15,000 candles. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Next, is the exact same price charted with "fair value" candles". Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice how different the candles are. Especially the wicks... Which candle do you think is easier to trade?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
"Fair Value Candles"! Truly inspiring and a novel way of plotting charts! Interesting to play with to see how to trade them. I am going to create an indicator for this...

--- 帖子 #171 ---
what is the fair value candle ??

--- 帖子 #181 ---
It's drawing the candles where the open price is first close above/below MA to start an opportunity to capture a premium or discount. The high/low is the same (MAE/MFE for the move) and the close is the MA value of price returning to "fair value".

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Thank you, Is it possible to code an indicator for fair value candles?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I think yoriz is going to code one, so if he wants to post it that will likely help. Anyone with decent coding experience should be able to easily do it in MT4 or PineScript (Trading View). I do all my coding/modeling in Python so my scripts will not really be of much use for folks here. Also, just adding the MA to the chart, you can see the "candles" as they are drawn by pricing moving around the MA. The images above are essentially just that movement compressed.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Can you share the algorithm so we can reproduce it?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Here is an implementation of the Fair Value Candles indicator for MT5*: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) yzFairValueCandles-1.0.ex5 14 KB | 259 downloads Here is an example screenshot: Attached Image (click to enlarge) *) No, I am not going to port the indicator to MT4. It is 2023. About time you upgrade to MT5... ;-)

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Sure, here is how I calculated each OHLC for the charts I posted. - OPEN = (Close &gt; MA &amp;&amp; Low &lt;= MA) || (Close &lt; MA &amp;&amp; LOW &gt;= MA) - One or the other - CLOSE = (High &gt; MA || Low &lt; MA) - Depending on what triggered the open. We aren't looking for close above/below fair value, just a touch. - HIGH = MFE from open. Since we are drawing the candles the MFE would be MAE when traded. - LOW = MAE from open. Since we are drawing the candles the MAE would be MFE when traded. IMPORTANT: The opening trigger does not determine if the candle will be green or red. It's important to understand that openings above the MA can produce both red/green candles. The same goes for opens below the MA. Additionally, the open use High/Low to determine "cross" vs. open because whenever fair value is returned, the next leg starts regardless if the candle has opened above/below the MA. Many candles return to fair value in their wicks, so if you don't use high/low you aren't compressing all of the normal OHLC candles.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
A man of the people! Thanks for sharing! When you draw price like this, hopefully, it becomes very obvious that fading wicks seem like a pretty good idea

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Ah, thanks for the details! I had to guess a bit, so I will double check my implementation against this later today and fix the rightmost current candle... Din-dins first....

Indeed, each wick that returns to the "plateau" is money earned. But how about the sometimes huge shifts between plateau heights? That is where theta catched up with us, costing us money, right?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
yes that is exactly correct. The large bodies in those big candles are those huge moves where theta eats up a ton of pips. As I said earlier, this isn’t some insanely high win rate strategy so there will be losses. It’s all about managing the trade and capturing as much wick as possible, averaging down to try and move your average entry as close to the peak of the wick as possible.

Hi yoriz, Firstly thank you for your valuable contribution to this interesting topic thus far. Unfortunately I am unable to keep up to date with this interesting project now because I do not have an option to upgrade from MT4 to MT5 currently. I am running a 2010 Applemac and I cannot upgrade to the operating software required to run MT5 without purchasing a newer Mac which due to financial constraints is not possible at the current time. I know you have said... No, I am not going to port the indicator to MT4, It is 2023 about time you upgrade to MT5? I agree with you wholeheartedly and would if I could but unfortunately I am unable to do so at the moment. Would you kindly consider if it is not too much trouble for you to upload a version of the 'Fair Value Candles indicator' for MT4 as well please? Thank you for your consideration. Kevin.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Are you sure? I am a Mac user myself and MT5 is running just fine in both VirtualBox (on very old 2013 Intel Mac) and using CrossOver (on the newest M2 MacMini).

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi yoriz, Thanks for getting back to me. I have a 2010 Mac Mini running OS 'El Capitan' via 'wine'. The earliest version of applicable OS software for running MT5 is 'High Sierra' according to my google search. I am not sure what 'VirtualBox is? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi yoriz, Having just googled VirtualBox it appears that this might be the answer to my problem? If I downloaded and installed this programme onto my Mac it appears that I could then run 'High Sierra' independently on my machine, is this correct? Thanks. Kevin.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Thank you for sharing. But it didn't make much sense to me. Because prices do not follow the average, averages follow prices.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi yoriz, Tried downloading VirtualBox but it will not mount on my Mac. Also downloaded the earliest version of Mac OS needed to run MT5 on my computer but unfortunately it is incompatible with updating from my current version of OS! Please can you reconsider uploading an MT4 version of your 'Fair Value Candles indicator'? I would be extremely grateful if this was possible. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Yes. So in the cone-shaped graphs I made that showed the price distribution, I should also draw the MA closing in. For each of these “random walks” we can also calculate how the MA was updated in each step and when price crossed the MA. With an EMA200 this is trivial, with SMA200 a bit more involved because the random walk bars must be preceded with the last actual 200 bars for the SMA to be correct. From this we can calculate the expectancy: given a certain “spread”, what is the average profit/loss. We use the same calculation to determine when to average down/scale-in: simply calculate if the expectancy improves, taking the improved average price but also the larger lotsize into account. Don’t average down until the stats show the expectancy improves by ‘x’ percent.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Sorry to hear you have no means to run MT5. But no, I am not going to spend hours of my time so you can save money and keep using your 13 year old computer. I hope you realize that to make money by trading you need capital to start with? If you can not afford to replace your old computer, I worry you can only trade using extreme leverage. Please be careful!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi wingate, Don't get blinded by wanting to use one specific indicator. If you are not able to run it, accept it and look for a strategy that fits your current situation and means. There are so many good ways to trade even without any indicator. After all, every indicator is just another representation of price. Nothing more, nothing less. It's never a holy grail, only a way to help us see things more clearly if we have the need. Keep at it, this forum is full of great ways to trade. The best of luck to you all!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi Yoriz, In your percentage distribution graph, I think SquareRoot Of Time works perfect for future boundaries estimation. I did a rough estimation from your graph. Here is how it goes: From 1 hour percentage figure, the 24 hour estimation would be SquareRoot(24/1)*1 Hr percentage From 6 hour percentage figure, the 24 hour estimation would be SquareRoot(24/6)*6 Hr percentage, etc etc..... Very interesting..

--- 帖子 #206 ---
to add to this, you don’t need a special indicator to see the candles. You can see them visually with just regular candles and a 200 MA, the custom candles are just the same data compressed into 4 data points per opportunity. the purpose of them is just a visual aid to see what we are trying to do with this strategy. When trading though, you should use normal OHLC with the 200 ma.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Good observation! This reminds me of this excellent thread by @AlphaOmega where he uses the same formula to model the price distribution over time throughout a single day: When I asked about the rationale behind the sqrt(t), I got the following reply from @StayFoolish:

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I’ll add to this as well, It’s not just price movements, it’s just built into any kind of process that has unique outcomes that are equally likely to occur. The more possible outcomes there are, the more unique pairs of outcomes there are (different sample paths). If you compare the unique pairs of one level to the previous, the ratio infinitely converged to 4. An interesting side effect of this is, if you want to double the volatility of outcomes, you have to quadruple the length of the process. this is why in any time series that is normally distributed, it takes 4 times as long for the series to move twice the distance. Example: - 2 possible outcomes = 2 unique pairs - 4 possible outcomes = 12 unique pairs - 12/2 = 6 - 8 possible outcomes = 56 unique pairs - 56/12 = 4.67 - 16 possible outcomes = 240 unique pairs - 240/56 = 4.29 - 32 possible outcomes = 992 unique pairs - 992/240 = 4.13. as you continue to double the possible outcomes, the ratio converges towards 4. So if it takes on average 5 candles for price to move 20 pips, it will likely take 20 candles for price to move 40 pips (assuming it’s perfectly normal).

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I haven't read the book unfortunately. But from so many articles I have read square root of time is an excellent predictor for volatility. For example to estimate weekly volatility from daily data, we would multiply the daily volatility by squareroot(7). Or 1 minute chart volatility to daily by multiplying it by squareroot of 1440 (number of minutes in a day). This rule will holds no matter what. I did so many tests few years back and the results are astounding... Alphaomega's quote is very correct. I even started a thread here few years back https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...the-unbeatable ?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Riscuit, The method you recommend looks good except the averaging down part. Eventually averaging might get out of hand. I am thinking about combining pairs so that they hover around certain mean and have a natural tendency to revert to the mean. I haven't tested it, just thought about it. For example: Long EURUSD Long GBPJPY Long AUDNZD Short AUDUSD Short EURJPY Short GBPNZD If you look carefully we are market neutral on all currencies but we have to find certain weights for each pair in order for this to work. We could equalize them by their volatility maybe, I honestly don't know at the moment. But they should hover around around a certain mean in theory. All ideas are welcomed

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Have a look at this thread by @7bit where he does exactly that: make a linear combination of symbols to create a mean reverting synthetic symbol.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
The sum of N draws from a normal distribution with mean µ and variance σ² is N times the mean (N.µ) and its variance is N times the variance (N.σ²). The standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance, is √(N.σ²) = σ√N.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I really like the idea of this approach of using multiple pairs to create essentially a “delta neutral” portfolio so there is minimal to no directional exposure on any one currency. This way, you are removing that volatility from your portfolio returns and isolating what it is we are actually trading (excess kurtosis). This would create a much smoother equity curve and reduce risk. this is exactly why I wanted to share the strategy. It has a lot to it already, but it is and never will be 100% complete so contributions like this, exploring different areas how we can optimize our results is just what this thread needs so thank you for sharing! I am going to explore this further and will share what I find on it here. this all being said, you are correct that you can not just average down indefinitely or else it is guaranteed that you will get over your skis risk wise and most likely blow up at some point. this is why one of the core tenants is to stay small. Keeping this in mind will save you from 95% of blow outs. there are also some strategies to handle this I will be sharing shortly, first will be “rolling” the trade to extend durations and reduce risk but again, the main thing is to stay small. Second is to understand you will not have 100% winrate. There will be times where theta eats your whole profit opportunity in the big moves so that you lose money based on average entry once price returns to fair value. You can’t avoid this just like in business there are times where you having losing SKUs or spikes in cost that produce loses for some products or for periods of times. It’s never about any one trade or move. It’s about the big picture, letting CLT work for you.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Another thought on how to optimize this, when exploring ideas, don't let perfection be the enemy of good. Will likely be impossible to maintain a completely delta-neutral position but even a 10%-25% reduction in portfolio volatility would be tremendous over time.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I totally agree Riskcuit. That should be the initial goal.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks Yoriz, I will be checking that thread....

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I checked it Yoriz. That seems to be using some kind of linear regression I think or optimized values for weights. I would rather have a robust method for weights which are based on current volatility, not optimization. Here is a rough idea: First of all calculating each pairs volatility starting with LN(close1/close2), say in 5 minute timeframe. Than take least squares moving average of it for a week long, so that would be 1440 bars. Now we have the volatility of all pairs that we are interested in. Convert the volatility to dollar amount using pip dollar values. Total the whole thing and divide each pair by the total. Now we have a percentage weight for each pair. After we get the percentage weights we should get the inverse, in other words highest weight should be the lowest weight so that our basket volatility would be reduced. I think we should be getting somewhere

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I think this method is a great way to start the weighting approach. Regarding the previous post mentioned AUD/USD, EUR/JPY, GBP/NZD as baskets, the challenge in this is assuming direction for each. There will be many instances where you can't be short all 3 pairs because of how the system works. What if on 2 pairs price is trading at a premium and on the one, the price is trading at a discount? Are you creating some synthetic price similar to the thread linked so you would trade all 3 short till they returned to a synthetic "fair value"? I could be misunderstanding your suggestion though so please correct me if that is the case. I think what's more important is, that you want to find as large a basket as possible where the correlation between all of the pairs in it is all as close to 0 as possible. This way the drawdowns and run-ups won't be correlated so the curve should smooth out and you trade each pair using the fair value model independent from one another (letting CLT take control) vs. letting the direction you hold on one pair, influence if you would be long/short another in the basket.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi Riskcuit, Long EURUSD Long GBPJPY Long AUDNZD Short AUDUSD Short EURJPY Short GBPNZD This combo is close to market neutral if we have correct weights. This is a basket index, 6 pairs in total. As you can realise all the currencies (not pairs) are neutral. we have 1 long and 1 short of each currency (again not pairs). The logic would be create the index chart, than wait for it to go above or below certain MA, than enter the trade with the whole basket with correct weights. Once the basket index touches the MA, you exit all positions. I hope I am clear To make it clear here is the basket summary: Index= (EURUSD*Weight)+(GBPJPY*Weight) + (AUDNZD*Weight) - (AUDUSD*Weight) - (EURJPY*Weight) - (GBPNZD*Weight) Longs are plus, shorts are minus....

--- 帖子 #220 ---
ahh I see! Thank you for clarifying this.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Don't even bother, it does not work. Distance to MA stays so low, no way to exploit it, unfortunately. One theory down the drain. Because the basket is very balanced. Sorry...

--- 帖子 #222 ---
In the thread from @7bit, he first tries to make a stable linear combination that is ranging around one price. Indeed, the deviation from the MA is small, because that is exactly what you try to minimize when calculating the weights. Later he realized the linear combination doesn’t need to be stationary but could also be rising. If you buy-and-hold the linear combination you are making money. Turns out the cointegration is too unstable so you are adjusting the weights all the time. Very interesting thread but out of scope for this one… However, I do agree with @Riskcuit that building a portfolio of symbols that are as much uncorrelated as possible with respect to the distance to MA can help to smoothen the equity curve.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Interested to know the strategy and following.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yeah, I was thinking about this more last night, and this would essentially just be creating a synthetic pair to pairs trade. In this case, the model error you'd need to watch for is the cointegration coefficient as this is what you are trying to profit from. In this case, it would be that the 2 synthetic pairs remain cointegrated consistently. I think 7bit hit it in his thread/demonstrated it well between his convos with OldDog, that the coefficient tends to be random similar to skew in that half the time it cointegrated and half the time it's not, so the result is a wash since you can't predict when it will or won't be with any accuracy greater than 50%.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi all, very interesting thread Riskcuit. I have a very basic knowledge about stats, so my contribution will be quite poor I suppose. As far as I know, the goal of getting a Delta 0 portfolio is to prevent from great deviations from the mean. Provided that here we are not looking for the great ones but for the "middle" deviations, if we try to reduce Delta we go in the wrong direction. Please correct me if I'm wrong. I would like to know how much Theta affects the strategy. One way to reduce Theta is to only open trades in the direction where we can get positive swaps. This will reduce the trade opportunities as well, but maybe the benefit is greater than the cost. This is something I'm not able to calculate, but some of you guys is maybe able to do it.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Unfortunately like the previous poster my knowledge about stats isn't the best (Maths wasn't my strongest subject lol). I have however attached a couple of indicators that I hope may prove fruitful to this project? They are self explanatory but if not clear then please just ask.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Initiating position above/below MA(200) I think improves the odds, but simple averaging is just too simple. Please consider hedging your position against trends. For that I find BB and a slower MA(365) helpful. If your position is running away, use MA(200) and BB bands to average the other way.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
This is a great suggestion and one I totally agree with. A lot of times it can be beneficial to manage the trade early. BBs are one way to do it, another way is at some percentage of the potential profit (50% is usually a good starting point for this). I will post some data on how this changes results whenever I get time. Obviously, on face value, you thought it would increase the win rate and reduce the average size of winners.

Rolling The Trade: One of the Risk Management Tools in Our Kit One thing very common in the world of options trading is this idea of "rolling" your trade. You can either roll your trade by changing its strike, duration, or both. And the purpose of rolling the trade is to re-position yourself to increase your chance of profit again. Or keep the dream alive that the position will payout. In our strategy, the concept is the same. We know it's not uncommon to get caught on the wrong side of monster moves. In these cases, it can sometimes make sense to "roll the trade" to a different "fair value" period. By doing this, we are typically able to reduce risk by booking profits on our most recent entries and lowering our overall exposure on the pair. This gives us more dry powder to re-add should price continue to run relative to our rolled "fair value". The whole point of rolling is to reduce risk and increase the probability of exiting the trade at least at break-even or with a small profit. Below is an example of a trade I rolled recently on EUR/NZD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see my 3 entries on this pair as price continued to ramp up. On all of these, I was targeting the 200MA as my exit at "fair value". But price was running pretty hard so it became obvious that exiting at my current target would result in a small loss. So in order to increase my probability of profit on this trade, I rolled my target to the 4HR chart's "fair value" (800 MA on the 1HR chart) and closed at about 50% max profit for an overall profit on the position. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Again the purpose of rolling a trade is to decrease risk. You can see by rolling to the 4HR's "fair value", I drastically increased the probability of getting into profits on my average entry, because I re-oriented with the market giving myself a large profit potential that will take theta a long time to eat up. This gives me the ability to turn a profit on the position without needing to deploy any additional capital. In a lot of cases, once you roll, you can usually book profits on your later entries, which will reduce your risk even further and allow you to average down at an even higher price should the run continue. As with all money management though, you can not roll indefinitely or else you will eventually pinch yourself with too much risk. Personally, I never roll more than 1 time, and once you have rolled, the real goal of that position is to simply get out at least break even. You aren't looking to turn a huge profit with the new large spread you have made available. You are looking to extend duration so the probability of you turning this potential loss into break-even or better is increased. I have also recently done this on my GBP/NZD short. On this roll though, I was able to book my 2 most recent orders with a small profit, while reducing my position size by 1/2. Attached Image (click to enlarge) By doing so, I know have a much smaller position (less risk), and I also have a much larger potential profit that will take theta a good amount of time to work through. And because my risk is reduced, should the price continue to run, I can average down at a better price than before, overall putting myself in a much better position to turn a profit. And again, I will not be looking to get out at the 4HR chart's fair value. I will get out before then, most likely at break-even for the average entry of my 2 orders that are still on (assuming I don't need to add any more positions to the trade).

--- 帖子 #230 ---
@Riskcuit I agree that shifting to 800MA you will get better chanse to close everything in profit or at breakeven but You had 3 entries → yes these 3 entries will give you the same DD for both MA. Your risk to blow the account is still the same. so, how are you able to reduce your risk in strong trends?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
the difference is I don’t need to add more risk in order to get out at break even. if I tried to size up so I would be BE at the 200MA, I would need to add a very large position to increase the probability of getting to BE or better. If it continued to run even more, the DD would worsen. By rolling to the 800, I can increase the probability of profit without adding any new positions, and because the potential profit to the next MA is very large, I won’t need to add any additional entries for sometime.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
try working backwards. Let’s confirm which timeframe the market is reacting to the most. Which time frame is respecting basic market fundamentals. Is it the 1 hour, 4 hour? If it’s the 4 hour let’s change to a lower time frame for basic entry models and use the HTF h4 for rolling when needed. This means in absolute worse case you’re rolling to a time frame that is already fundamentally supported and aligned with our targets. This could be an extra step to creating more profitable tools for the system

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Firstly apologies to Riskcuit if my contribution below is considered to be 'off subject' and unhelpful, that is not my intention. Please advise if this is the case and I will refrain from posting further no problem whatsoever. I have no intention of gate crashing this interesting thread, I will continue to follow from the sidelines and remain silent. As previously mentioned I do not have the mathematical mind of you guys. My approach is very simple, applying the two indicators previously uploaded to generate 'buy' and 'sell' signals based on 'the average candle sizes' in 'real time over any given period' (in this case 200). Signals can be taken in either ' one direction only ' as per religiously following the 200EMA as per this thread OR in ' both directions at the same time ' closing either the 'basket' of buys or sells once the opposite signal has been generated and the current basket is in profit (hope that made sense). Attached are all indicators required and a template. I suggest you experiment with a pair of your choosing on a 15m timeframe and monitor for a couple of days, you should get a clear idea by then. Make sure you change the candle size setting in the ' Body Size Indicator ' to the same number that is shown in the top left corner of your chart and you're good to go! This 'average' candle number will constantly update of course so make sure to periodically amend in the 'Body Size Indicator' from time to time. I think everything else is self explanatory, please ask if not.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Forgot to mention. If you open the ' Custom Indicator-Average Candle ' you will see the timeframe is set to the 1HR timeframe (and not the 15M). This is deliberate and has the effect of reducing the number of signals generated on the chart. When the trend ultimately goes against you, less signals are generated therefore less positions are opened resulting in reduced drawdown.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Buying and selling simultaneously is challenging, especially when trading on lower timeframes. Higher timeframes become easier albeit drawdown can increase. The chart below illustrates the various options available to 'take profit' whilst maintaining a comfortable margin relative to your balance. Profit can be taken by closing the 'whole basket' of buy's and sells OR close the 'Buy' profits and continue adding positions as per the signals until such time as you are able to bank more profit before starting again. I hope these ideas are food for thought moving forward albeit slightly off topic. I will remain silent on the sidelines now as I have no interest in high jacking Riskcuit's excellent thread. Kind regards.

I have created a new toy for you guys! The indicator attached to this post is for MT5 and looks like this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It mainly does three things: It predicts how the SMA200 will develop in the future (red and gray lines, median, +/- 1 sigma, +/- 2 sigma respectively) It shows after how much time and at what price the market did intercept the SMA200 in the past (red dots) It calculates at what future price the market will most likely intercept the SMA200 (blue line) I created a short movie showing the indicator in action: Inserted Video The gap between the current price (green line) and the predicted intercept (blue line) is your potential profit. I find it interesting to see in the movie that a large spread is not necessarily a large profit. Sometimes the spread is large but the blue and green lines almost overlap! Also, sometimes the blue line is at the "wrong" side suggesting not mean reversion but mean aversion! Here is the indicator: Attached File(s) yzMA200Reversion-1.1.ex5 17 KB | 205 downloads For those interesting the technical details: 1. It draws the SMA200 moving average of the past price data (red line) 2. It calculates the current "spread": the distance between current price and the SMA200. 3. It searches backwards over the last 4 years ( "LookbackDays" input parameters) to similar occurances of that same spread. Similar is defined as occurances where the distance was within +/- TolerancePoints points (not pips) of the spread we see currently. 4. It calculates how the current(!) SMA(200) would develop if price would move similarly as it did during these occurances. Note that this means we combine the last few recent bars, with the old bars we saw in the past. The old prices are scaled accordingly towards the current price. The SMA200 is calculated using this mix of old and new bars. 5. Of all these occurances, it draws the median (red line), the +/- 1 sigma and +/- 2 sigma lines (gray lines). 6. Of all these occurances, it calculates the number of bars it took before the SMA200 was intercepted, and at what offset relative to the starting price (again scaled accordingly towards the current price). It will draw a red dot showing where the current market would intercept if price action would be identical. 7. It calculates the average price of all the red dots and draw a blue line at that average price. Note it does not use the median price (most likely event), but the average price (the expectancy) because the outliers of the past could happen again and can pull the average away from the median. Naturally, next on my list is to embed this algorithm in an Expert Advisor and see what that brings...

--- 帖子 #237 ---
how to use this Indicator in trading ?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
The indicator "predicts" the future (or actually projects past price behavior onto the current market). If you would make an entry right now, the blue line shows where you most likely would intercept the SMA200 in the future. So, if the gap between the current price and the blue line is large, that means you have a good chance to make some money. If the current price and the blue line are close together, there is not much to gain. Obviously, this is all based on the statistics of the past behavior so no guarantees. All the red dots are possible outcomes, so these include both winning and loosing trades. The blue line is merely the average of the red dots. For single trades there is not much certainly, but when repeated over many trades you can expect the average return of the blue line.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Thank you for clarifying this.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
This is really a fascinating tool! Thanks a lot, yoriz!

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Update : I realized the calculation of the blue line in the indicator above was not fair. The indicator stopped searching for "red dots" (intercepts as they occurred in the past) when it reached the end of the red/gray lines (the MA forecast). However, there can obviously be intercepts that have taken longer than that. By omitting these red dots, the average was skewed towards the intercepts that were fast. I have updated post #236 with version 1.1 that keeps searching for the intercept of each occurance beyond the right side of the screen until it has found it. I believe the calculation is now correct, but unfortunately I noticed that the blue line is now also much closer to the current price. Regularly the blue line is even at the "wrong" side of the current price suggesting not a mean reversion but a mean "aversion". Check the updated video for an example.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Does anyone have a similar indicator that has a variable to disable the audio notification?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
you can modify the indicator so that it displays the number of points between the green line and the blue line on the chart ?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Interesting request! What information are you trying to get from that? Practically: the number of points varies each time the indicator updates itself (~every 5 seconds), so perhaps a percentage of the total number of points is better? In my experiments I have seen anything between 17 and 3500 points. It obviously depends on the time frame and how often that specific spread occurred in the past 4 years.

How do you roll-over/manage the trade when the 800 MA is on the opposite side of your positions and keep running away?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
If this is the case, you have been way too aggressive trading the 200MA. You should really only be rolling to the 800 if you are caught in a really large move (the kind that occurs &lt;5% of the time for any sample), which would essentially guarantee the 800 MA won't be on the wrong side. Additionally, you need to manage your risk/size as if every move was one of the &lt;5% moves, which means, staying small, so average down against big moves is not capital intensive, or stressful. The trading should be very smooth and relaxing. A good rule to help this is to ensure no single entry uses more than 1:1 leverage. This is harder to do if you are trading smaller TFs but on the 1HR &amp; up charts, this provides plenty of opportunity for profits. For example, here is a CHF/JPY trade I entered last night that looks like it's going to go pretty well... BUT it could still turn at any moment. Currently, the 800MA is on the wrong side, but I won't be rolling to the 800MA unless the pair sinks to at least 160.00 or even lower, and only if the move down is so strong that I get over my skis on the 200MA and want to try and get out at BE. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The thing with rolling is, that there isn't a hard rule of when exactly to do it, and ideally, you very rarely ever do need to do it. It's really just a way to extend the duration with the hopes of getting out at BE or a little better for the times when you may have gotten a little aggressive a little too soon. It shouldn't be a regular occurrence and if you can get out at the 200MA with even jut a small loss, that is probably better to do than roll to the 800.

Here are my results for August with this strategy, The Month started slow but ended well Many will turn their nose up at 4% (which is a lower monthly return than usual) but 1.04^12 = 60% annualized. So I'll take 4% from stress-free, low-intensity trading any time! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Lastly, look at the breakdown of the trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Booked over 1000 pips with a win rate of 78% and I had an average loss of 36 pips and an average win of 47 pips. That's money dude!

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Congrats! Around August 20, you had DD of around 10-11 %, which is not bad...would you cut positions if DD was 15%, 20%? Did you take only 36 trades or you counted each time you took profit/exited on the basket of trades as one trade?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I have similar statistics so far trading your ideas. I trade on M15 so might become more stressful. This week was easy.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
There were 36 total trades (unique orders/entries) for the month as shown in the last pic. I would definitely be defending positions a lot harder if DD was approaching 15%-20%. Something to understand is DD will always be pretty large relative to run-up. If we are looking to make 4% a month, we should expect to have draws ATLEAST the same size, if not double or triple depending on how high our rate is. Many trades will spend the majority of their time in draw because we are waiting for returns to fair value, we aren't trying to predict turns in the market. Also at that time, I probably had positions in anywhere from 6-8 pairs, so 10% spread across that many pairs is pretty low per pair (and once you are in multiple pairs and have rolled trades, you are likely trading some currencies both ways so the drawdown between those positions will level off/hedge each other out a bit).

--- 帖子 #251 ---
All below is based on your numbers for August, the month you deem to be satisfactory at 4% in profit. Let's say that average profit is 4% a month, regardless how many pairs you trade. It is easy to get to 15% DD at which point you may have to cut the whole multiple pair position. That would take close to 4 months to get it back, considering every next month is on average is 4% Win. If you increase position size, your DD will be even larger meaning you may have to cut it quicker. 15% DD a month with 4% in profit is a tough sell. Those are the facts...still much work to be done.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Not what I meant. Say you enter somewhere in the orange bubble: Attached Image (click to enlarge) But theta is consummed and you add somewhere in the second orange bubble: Attached Image (click to enlarge) How do you manage/mitigate this? Attached Image (click to enlarge) In this example the price had a nice pullback to close on the red MA800 at -450 pips but it might not have happened. The max DD was -850 pips on this example. The winners are relatively much smaller. Note: There are 760 H1 bar between the first entry and the MA800 crossing the price.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
The risk may not be as tolerable for others but I find it to be fine/easy to deal with. Also if you understand risk/reward and probabilities it should be fairly obvious that if your win rate is above 50%, your drawdowns will almost always be larger than your run ups for any sample period. If that isn’t intuitive for you, I’d recommend reading more on probability theory.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Yeah, so this is an instance where you'd almost certainly end up with a net loser across all the positions for this move, whether you rolled or not. This large of a move is a &lt;3% (probably even a less than 1%) of the time move, and these are the ones you need the be careful about. As I have said many times, this isn't some 100% win martingale strategy. You will have occasional losers, and they can be very large (this is why I mentioned VAR being very large, and you should assume every trade can draw down to VAR). Below is your image marked up, The black lines show where theta needs to eat your opportunity away before you should consider re-adding. It also assumes you rolled after the 3rd entry (which it really probably would have been better to just take the net loss on the return to 200 after the 3rd entry on all 3 orders). Attached Image (click to enlarge) As I mentioned in the first post about rolling, when you roll, you typically want to take risk off after doing so by reducing your positions (like I showed in GBP/NZD). So after that 3rd entry (and you roll to 800 MA), you are looking to close that 3rd entry at BE or small profit to reduce risk, because you know you have just extended your duration by rolling, and should be expecting the drawdown to continue (this is why you rolled in the first place). You had many chances to also as it was trading around that 3rd entry for at least 12 or so hours a few days after the entry (when it returned to the 200MA). Also, once you roll, the management technique of using theta rolls to the higher MA as well, so you wouldn't re-add for a while after the 3rd entry. So in this instance, assuming you were super mechanical, you'd end up with 2-3 losers and a winner, but an overall net loss on position. It happens, this is why you need to stay small so you can weather these storms that occur 1-3% of the time. Lastly, typically when you are in these moves, you know it, so you are more cautious to add in general as you know you are in a tail move that can run run run. In these cases, you typically aren't trying to add as soon as possible at each possible entry. You should think, "This thing is running, even though I technically could add here by XYZ rules, I probably shouldn't and should look to at a higher price, which will almost surely occur because I rolled the trade, extending my duration, therefore extending the possible levels price can reach in either direction”. You never roll the trade because you think you are timing a turn in the market. It's the opposite, you roll the trade because you have no clue when it will turn, and you don't think it will be soon, so you are being less aggressive once you roll. Rolling is not a get-out-of-jail-free card and if you struggle with risk management, you probably shouldn't do it as it can cause more harm than good if you use it too aggressively. You roll for a last-ditch effort to reduce the loss you will take/give you a chance to turn it into a winner or BE. That doesn't mean it works in your favor 100% of the time. If folks are looking for something like this, they will never find it in the trading business.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Probability theory, You are wrong here and I will be gentile, it is Friday, any technique that has 4 times DD(I know you have 3 times DD but we have to account for WTF moments) of the potential monthly profit, is technique that is very close to failure. If you have $100,000 to trade and you are $16,000 negative in DD hoping to make $4,000 at the end of the month, the probability is you will not place another trade.

Thank you riskcuit for this nice and simple strategy. I tested it on a small live account. I used too much risk, I know , but I know what I do, since I am trading since over 15 years now. Here is the result from the last 3 weeks: Attached Image (click to enlarge) i can only suggest everyone to live test this strategy. Especially I like riscuits analogy to a real market store . A whole different view to the markets. But as he said, the power of this strategy is to trade often and many markets. The losers, which will appear are than not big anymore… thanks again riscuit.

Mean reversion has a higher-than-expected relative drawdown based on the posts here - something amiss. Try VWAP or TWAP with progressive entry(ies) instead. It helps to reduce floating dd at the moment. Additionally, mean-regression model for smaller accounts sub 250k can look at higher timeframe time-bars to follow the trend while regressing back to WAP. Cheers, PDX

Hi everyone. Really interesting topic. a question: can the distance indicator be modified so that it updates automatically when we change currency pairs? The one I have must be updated manually every time I change pairs. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Like yoriz did (btw thanks for the details and the video!), I wondered if it would be interesting to trade the future fair value instead of the current MA. My idea was to use the standard deviation (over 200 samples) to estimate where the price has a good chance to meet the moving average in the future. A picture explains better: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The formula used is (forecast is a user input, I chose 24 bars): Technical note: the lag of an EMA depends on the price action so I replaced it by a LWMA which lag is constant to 1/3 of its period. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Adding a bit of smoothing to the result and surrounding with 1 ATR: (black=MA200 and red=MA800) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #265 ---
it seems to work like this... 4 successes out of 4. you need to put some pips before the sma 200 as tp. maybe instead of using the sma 200 close you could use the sma 200 high and sma 200 low channel to set the tp

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I am a little confused what exactly the bands are showing if you don’t mind clarifying. Is it saying at this point (a close price and the bands at this index), the MA will meet somewhere in the bands range within 200 candles approximately 68% of the time?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
It replaces the MA200 a bit like the blue line in yoriz video. It is the target price. I use the MA200 to project the trend (trend following component) and the 1st standard deviation is a kind of the mean reverting component you expect the price to stay in... I'm not 100% sure it makes complete sense TBH. A simple idea is to buy when below the band and sell above with a TP at the opposite side. I'm not sure at all about the SL. The relative position of the bands gives a bias about the trend like the two MAs.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Looking at the bottom chart that you posted above, the model is effectively assuming that the moving average will continue with the same slope into the future. This assumption is generally valid when the market is trending but makes the estimate overshoot when the moving average changes direction. So the cumulative errors keep getting bigger and don't fully offset and thus the bands tend to not be centered on the price and don't do a good job representing future value. The estimate's error is measurable at a given point (price - estimate). You could add a fraction of the error (1/n or 2/n * error) to the estimate at each step to at least center the bands on the price. However there will still be lagged overshoot and your bands will be noisier. But it may be somewhat more useful in giving an estimate of potential future value.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Thanks for clarifying! Very cool stuff. something I think to be careful of, is not getting back into the habit of trying to forecast directionality of price. as soon as you do this, you are back to betting on skew more than anything. And if you add a TP or SL that will make it a binary outcome, you have essentially “flattened” everything else out (volatility, kurtosis) and are only trading skew at that point, which is the hardest to trade over time in my opinion. The goal is to isolate kurtosis or volatility as much as possible as these are easier to trade.

I know a lot of folks are tired of hearing me harp about option theory as it relates to dynamic hedging, but it’s really an amazing example of isolating a variable to trade that isn’t skew. it’s also the core inspiration for this method. Instead of isolating volatility, we are trying to isolate kurtosis. We like volatility to a degree but it’s not the “driver” of profits or losses like it is in dynamic hedging. when folks are thinking about ways to improve or tweak the model to their liking, I would encourage them to try and do so in a way that is isolating something other than skew for all the reasons stated previously. To help again with what this can look like, let’s review trading an option pricing model combined with dynamic hedging to target volatility. We will simplify the inputs to: - distribution (assume normal) - volatility - strike - duration we then use our inputs with the model to generate a price for the option. let’s say it comes out to $4.00. So we sell the option for $4.00. Now we need to isolate the volatility so that is the only thing we are actually trading by using dynamic hedging. This means we will match the delta(probability of profit) of the option with shares throughout the life of the option. Because we sold the option, we will have negative gamma exposure, simply meaning, as we modify our hedge, we will always take a loss on the adjustments, except for the last one to close out the hedge, that can be a winner or loser. This is where the magic happens. If you are able to operate at the limit (small possible price increment with no friction), the combined PnL of the profits received from selling the option (the $4.00), plus the profits from managing and closing out the hedge, will always equal the payoff of the option contract for the path price took, regardless of what path that is. I’d re-read it so it really sinks in. Because of the dynamic hedging, it doesn’t matter what path price takes, the combined PnL from selling the option and managing the hedge, will always be equal to the payoff of the option contract for the path price took during the contract. if you sold a ton of options, and delta hedged them all and none of the inputs we used to calculated the option price has changed, then averaged all of these payoffs, guess what they would equal? $4.00. so if the inputs never changed, the combined PnL of the selling and hedging would be 0. The cost of hedging will always average out to -$4.00, the price you sold the option for. The only way this changes is if volatility changes, which is really the most likely thing to change in the model. if volatility was higher than what was used to calculate the option price, the profits from selling the option and hedging the delta would be negative, again regardless of whatever path price took. This is because you would have collected more negative gamma than expected while managing the hedge. if the volatility was lower than what was used to calculate the option price, the profited from selling the option and hedging the delta would be positive, again regardless of whatever path price took. So by delta hedging with the proceeds from selling the option, you are zeroing in on volatility and trading specifically that. You can even zero in on the volatility with just the delta hedging (with out selling the contract), but by doing so, you are exposing PnL to the skew of each path (just like a single option contract). This is because an option contract by definition is a volatility bet, even if you didn’t dynamically hedge it. So dynamically hedging alone is also a volatility bet since that is how you “manufacture” the option. This wont necessarily affect expectancy since the effects of the skew would even out over time, but it will impact the volatility of returns, making them much more choppy than if you sold the option in addition to the deploying the hedge. This should blow your mind if you haven’t realized that this is how a model can work to isolate a variable to trade other than skew. it truly is an amazing application of probability theory. Again, the variable we want to try and isolate is kurtosis and/or volatility, and we are trying to use the MA in order to do so. P.S. An option contract is simply an f(x) and it's price is the expectancy of f(x). Every f(x) has a delta (probability of profit). This means every f(x) has gamma. Theta = gamma * -1.

Hedging options with shares is one thing, hedging in forex in another. Is there hedging in your strategy, or just averaging?

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hedging as described above is not part of the strategy. Above comments are to illustrate other attempts at isolate variables to try and trade, besides skew.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Wonder to know your exit point,thanks.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Absolutely true. I tried adding the curvature of the MA but the result is very unstable. Also the MA200 has nothing special and any MA would have its own slope. I know not objective way to select the "best". I don't even know how to estimate the error, even in long hindsight. What was the fair value at a given point in the past?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
You also do! Betting the "mean reversion" is a already directional forecast. With options you can build a straddle which is a bet that the price won't move far away. This already is a directional forecast (except you also trade the volatilty short). In spot trading you cannot profit from a "non-move". When you short at the time the price is well above the MA you do bet the direction. The skew is the current trend and it happens to be the prevalent statistics in price. Mean reversion is close to non existant in the data. A mean reverting process looks like a noisy oscillator. Yet the data looks like an expanding cone (post #169). You trade toward the fair value (the MA200) but this value drifts over time. Going in the direction of the drift is safer.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
In this situation the price is mainly below the black EMA200 line. You will mainly enter long trades during this down trend and the price will often require that you average down. Attached Image (click to enlarge) With the "forecast" -- which like FXEZ underlined I admit is crap -- you mainly sell during this period because the price is more often above the band. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Haha yes on the surface it does appear directional, similar to an option contract. But at its core, it’s not a directional bet. Lets think back to how the price of an option contract is calculated. For one contract in isolation, it’s a directional bet, but in aggregation, the only way the buyer of options can make money consistently is if they only buy options that have under priced volatility. Otherwise, the accumulation of all bets will result in $0.00 profit. The seller can only make money if they can sell the contract with overpriced volatility. The path of any one result does not matter in aggregation. Someone can buy an overpriced contract that does payoff for some paths (many possible paths even) but it doesn’t mean volatility was priced right, so in aggregation it they over paid for it, the winners won’t matter because the volatility of the losers matters as well. This system is designed to be the same way. For any one opportunity, direction matters because you have to trade one way or the other. But in aggregation, it’s not what we are using to drive profits/actually trading or “forecasting” to be more specific. if you get wrapped up in anyone opportunity or the idea of trying to predict which path will be taken, you are missing the forest for the trees. also regarding the idea that “skew” is the most prevalent part of price, I would push back this pretty strongly in 2 ways but I am open to changing my mind depending on the arguments. But for me, the real big issues are: 1. If skew is so prevalent (true skew) in any meaningful/consistent way, why is it essentially impossible to trade? Traditional trading would be extremely easy if this were the case. 2. Skew is going to manifest itself in long leads. This doesn’t mean it’s actually real. Think of Brownian motion drawn with coin flips. The results have long leads, meaning it rarely even ends where it started, and will spend most of its time “trending” one way or the other, ending above/below where it started. when you look at the paths in isolation, they all have skew one way or the other, but in aggregation, we know there is no actual skew in the data, and all the observable skew on any one path is cancelled out by the other paths that skewed the other way. This idea of skew manifesting in long leads but actually always averaging out to 0.00 between all the paths, is why it’s so friggin hard to trade consistently.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
How do you know this single path is a true representation of population skew and not just a long lead on a distribution with no skew? I have tried to solve that problem for years and years and years but never cracked it… For every path like this, there is one going up. and many many many more that chop.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
What you describe is an option straddle. But you cannot build a straddle with longs and shorts. You can't trade volatily directly this way.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
No no no, it’s not a straddle. I am talking about a single call or put contract. Even with a SINGLE contract, you are trading volatility in the aggregate of your trades, not direction. A some example: Here is a call price with following inputs: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The price of this call or fair value is $6.30. This is the price because if you were to hold this contract 1000 times and price mirrored the inputs used to calculate it, the expectancy, or expected value, or average all of the wins and losses, would be exactly $6.30. Here is what happens if volatility was under priced: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The expectancy, or expected value, or average of all wins and losses of holding this contract 1000 times has risen. Nothing has changed in skew. The only thing that changed was volatility. This is why even a single contract in isolation is really a volatility bet when aggregated with all your other trades. You are betting that the contract mispriced volatility. The directionality is built in the contract so your PnL will be more volatile based on the direction of paths your observe and the order you observe them in, but it’s only doing just that, affecting the volatility of returns, not the expectancy of the returns.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
To test that hypothesis, I changed the script from post #169 to only measure the price drift at each M1 bar if price has changed at least +3% in the previous 24 hours. If skew is not real, you would think averaging over the last 4 years (=1.4M bars) would give symmetric price distribution cones similar to post #169. However, this is what I measure: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That seems to suggest price is indeed mean reverting! However, price rarely moves +3% in 1 day. It happened only 73 times in the last 4 years, so the above is based on only 1893 M1 bars. Let's look at the price drift after a -2% change in the previous 24 hours (which happened 625 times in the last 4 years, giving 11696 M1 bars): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Interesting! Now there doesn't seem to be mean reversion, however, the cones are much wider suggesting after a -2% change the volatility of the markets remains a bit higher than usual...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
very cool graph. With the +3% and -2% graphs, are things changes of + or - 3%, etc? Or only looking at +3% moves (not -3% in last 24hr moves)? can you draw the graphs with no filtering, so it captures all 1.4m data points?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
The +3% graph picks all M1 bars where price has increased 3% or more during the previous 24 hours. The -2% graph picks all M1 bars where price has decreased 2% or more during the previous 24 hours. Starting from that M1 bar, it looks forward to the next 1, 2, 3, etc. hours and keeps track of the price change. It then selects the 0.135-, 2.275-, 15.865-, 50.000-, 84.135-, 97.725- and 99.865-percentiles from the list of price changes at each hour. Obviously many of the M1 bars will be "clustered" or adjacent because they all had the same strong move in the previous 24 hours. Assuming there are at least 48 hours between "occurances", then the +3% case had 73 occurances, and the -2% case had 625 occurances. That is the graph in post #169.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Thank you! The 3 charts together paint a good picture of what I am trying to describe with skew. If you slice certain parts, it appears like there is some kind of skew. However you are simply slicing down to small sample sizes, where the illusion of skew is only going to grow larger and larger as you slice down to a single path like one PipMeUp has posted where it appears to be obvious that forecasting skew is the way to go. but once you account for the entire picture, the symmetry or lack of obvious/consistent skew is hard to argue against. It’s very similar to how a median and mean are different. The median is what you observe in time, where as the mean is what you converge to over time as you increase sample size. you my never actually observe the mean result in a single sample path, but you inevitably will arrive at it in aggregation. You may never observe true 0 skew in any sample paths, but you will inevitably arrive to it in aggregation.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Initial thought: This system will work until your counterparty gets tired of you and then it will suddenly claw back everything and then some. Reference: the waste elimination volumes of elephants versus the caloric intake of birds. Second thought: if you are truly trading small compared to the account size then you are earning the risk free rate at a greater risk than holding bonds. What do you estimate for an annual return on average?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Unfortunately you have to slice because despite the trend is overall zero it is made of a succession of up, then down, then up trends... You don't trade the average, you average the trades. In math terms the limit of the expectancy is different from the expectancy of the limit. You are absolutely right when you say that no one can distinguish a real trend from a fluke move. It is even worse. Using excel you can generate normally distributed random walks with a positive expectancy (a controlled environment of which you know the parameters). Hitting F9 you get new ones. In general it goes up but sometimes: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The sample is so small that the estimated mean is negative instead of the true +0.05. (you need at least 10000 samples to estimate the mean of a normal distribution with 1% tolerence). I personnally think that even if this a fluke move better be short than right when it happens!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
If you are so excited about the success of these simple mean reversion strategies.....then just wait until you (re)discover grid trading! It will blow your mind! Given enough (infinite?) capital you don't have to worry about statistics, directions and predictions. Why? Because you can exploit the entire price curve. Now I know some people will jump here to tell me how the numbers don't add up and martingale is hopeless and so on.... And this is the problem here - How to get the right answers if you don't know the right questions? It's a bit like this new "AI" hype with the language models. It's only as smart as the person asking the questions. If you ask dump questions you will get dump (useless) answers. Not to mention the quality of the database. As the saying goes "garbage in, garbage out". Ask yourself this: How the market makers can afford to take the other side of every incoming market order at any price level? And even more important - Why the "regulators" tried so hard to enforce the FIFO rule on retail FX a few years ago?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
That's exactly what I mean by "You don't trade the average, you average the trades". And indeed martingale is not the solution except for people who claim they are so smart they can beat the math until they no longer claim anything when their trade explorer suddenly stops updating...

--- 帖子 #289 ---
This is exactly what I am saying.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Thanks for dropping in alphaomega! Big fan of your work! You guys are really missing the point I am making though. I have explained the exact question quoted in detail multiple times in the thread. Specifically, the information around delta hedging to isolate volatility via gamma accumulation (you don't even need the initial contract either to do it). This is exactly why they can take the opposite side of any trade and don't give 2 shits about the result of any single path... Please re-read the post. The accumulation of delta hedging in aggregate covers the cost of any and every path the price can take, whether it's up or down, so your PnL is only influenced by volatility. They do not care about any particular path and therefore the result of a particular contract. They care about the number of occurrences as this is what allows you to "trade the average". CLT through a large number of occurrences is precisely how you "trade the average". Here are some examples showing how this works for certain price paths, using same inputs: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see how the delta-hedge payoff snaps to the contract's payoff at the end of its life. Whether or not this snaping lands above or below the payoff is the result of the path's volatility relative to the volatility used to price the contract, NOT the direction the path took, or if the option ended OTM, ITM, or ATM. Over time, if the paths consistently have more volatility than what was used in the initial calc, on average, the seller would have spent more buying the contract back than they made selling it. Vice versa if it is lower. So the only thing they are trading is volatility, they do not care about the result of any one path, or where the next path will go (will be bull or bear? Who cares!). As long as you are concerned about the result of any 1 particular path and trying to predict or forecast it, you have completely missed the point...

I think most of us in the mean reversion camp. For my part I hope to learn more tricks.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Do you know the history of LTCM and the end result of their "dynamic hedging" strategy?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Yes sir! They were “highly leveraged” which caused them to blow up. It’s the same thing that causes anyone who has ever blown up in the past or will blow up in the future. Nothing new or revolutionary about it. A tale as old as time. Even with positive EV systems, you will blow up if you don’t stay small. I am curious though, are you arguing that option market makers don’t dynamically hedge to synthetically sell/buy back the options they trade at mid prices? Do you think MM firms are forecasting skew to transact across the bid and ask?

Hey parisboy, Do you mind clarifying what you are trying to show in these? I assume the bands are where you are looking to enter to trade back to fair value, but am curious how you are calculating their widths?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Width of the "Band" = 1/4 of your screen Price Range Roughly Price can be represented as a Sinewave oscillating around the Trend The Centered Moving Average = The Trend 256 Days = 1 Year in Daily The sinewave explains the 50% retracement

--- 帖子 #304 ---
sinewaves

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Because you're using a non-causal smoother (=uses data from the future) as opposed to a filter. The dotted lines project the bands forward and will correct with every new bar. With a usual MA the price doesn't return to the MA. It is the MA that catches up the price when it slows down.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
No use of data from the Future

--- 帖子 #307 ---
The centered moving average is a MA shifted backward in time. At a given bar the value of the MA is the value the MA will have in &lt;lag-of-the-MA&gt; bars. The current bars are a linear projection which will repaint.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
no the last Centered Moving Average point calculated is calculated with real price (see solid Envelopes and Centerlines) the dotted line is just an extrapolation

--- 帖子 #314 ---
By the way the "exactness" of the extrapolated boundaries has just to do with the methodology of the calculation of the "width " of the Band which encloses "most of " Price oscillations around the Centered Moving Average (the Trend)

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Pretty sure it's just taking the last slope of the known MA and projecting it forward from that point in a straight line. This assumes the future slope is going to be the same on each bar. It's a simplistic assumption but you know that the price will generally stay inside the 2 standard deviation bands, and that's the governing principle. The centered moving average for a given length can be used as fair value. As you know, you only have the last MA value so error can only be computed up to the current bar minus the lag amount of the MA. So it won't be available for for real-time analysis.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Of course it is what he does. It looks good in hindsight or when the price waves nicely like on the right hand side of the screnshot. But doing the same thing in real time when the price is like the left hand side right before the MA turns sharp the envelop will overshot. The price in this situation will be far below the projected envelop. The envelop will later self correct and look nice like it does on the screenshot.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
100% agree. These approaches are usually red herrings. Would be interesting to see chart if it showed all of the projected values at each step so you could see the differences between projected and realized values.

Hi Riskcuit - reference you example of the 3 trades in post 229 (before you rolled) - i am curious to understand if you used the same position size on trades 2 &amp; 3 (as trade 1). If you are applying different trade sizes, could you explain how you calculate the size?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I typically use a fixed lot size for each entry. If it starts really running you can break your "entry" in 2 legs so you add 1/2 of the new entry at a time. For leverage, I wouldn't start with anything larger than 1:1 per entry. Especially when starting out with the system, you should probably 1/2 it just to get a feel for what it's like to actually trade it.

Interesting concept, a while ago I programmed an EA with very similar logic to carry out tests, but the results were not satisfactory. I tested only on EURUSD M5. The backtest result for 2023 is excellent, for the last 5 years it is not so good and for the last 10 years it is bad. I think that in my free time I will test other assets and maybe test oscillators as reversal indicators.

I made this tool some time ago for research purposes to see how exactly the prices (high-Low) are distributed during the 24 hour cycle. You can place it in indicators folder and see for yourself. It's a bit CPU intensive because of the way I code it.....but it works and the data is accurate. You can point at any level and it shows you the distance and the exact time and date. So you can go back in history to check how this day looks and what is the shape of the curve. You have to click on the button "Calculate" to draw the data. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Personally I think that mean reversion strategies work well in the forex market, by nature countries strive to make their currencies strong, which makes trends in this market not so long, so for me it makes sense to use strategies that revert to the mean or to its "fair" price. I think the main thing is to stay with small positions, open trades every time the price moves away from the fair price and if you have to open new trades (having some open trades) you have to do it with enough distance between trades. Below I share the results of a mean reversion system (with a backtest of 100% data quality) the following results over a period of just over 6 years following the principles mentioned earlier in this thread. these are the results of a backtest of a mean reversion system from 2018 to 2024, you can see that it has a considerable maximum drawdown period, but by keeping it small you can overcome that difficulty as well. USDCAD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The point is that I agree with Riskcuit about his trading and the advice he gives on how to stay in the game with this type of strategy. It is worth noting that this strategy by its nature (uses stochastic indicator) can have buy and sell trades open at the same time, making the impact of the drawdown in strongly trending markets easier to handle.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I remember an expert once said, use a logarithmic scale for prices to ensure symmetry. Percentage increases and decreases are not symmetrical in finance. I also remember a teacher once said that if the price is ranging, then trade inside. This means from outside known average observations to the mean. When the price is trending, then trade outside. This means from the mean to whatever the price would be, until the price reversal, either at the top or bottom.
