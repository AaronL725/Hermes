Hello Guys: I wanted to share this strategy that I have been trading on my live account for about couple months. It has been very profitable and safe from all of the market movement and allows you to make daily swaps without having 2 broker accounts of risk a major drawdown. Anyone can start with this and gradually increase their position. Basically you will set the following order and they have to be in the same ratio and placed within seconds of each other for maximize stability. I usually do this at 4:55 PM EST just before the swap being calculated: 1 LOT BUY (+)GBP/JPY(-) 1 LOT SELL (-)CHF/JPY(+) 1 LOT SELL (-)GBP/USD(+) 1 LOT SELL (-)USD/CHF(+) Now this is sort like a combination hedge but using 4 pairs. If you separate each pair, you will see that you are SELLING and BUYNG All 4 currencies at the same time, see the (+) and (-) that I placed Next each currency? You will see that I am buying GBP, Selling GBP, Buying CHF, Selling CHF, etc... This will net you about $11.00 USD in swap per day if using FXDD. The margin requirement for a 200:1 account is about $2500, so u need to have a $3500 account to do this. You must get a 200:1 or 400:1 leverage, so make sure you ask for it. Now $11.00 per day is about $330 per month, which is like 10% return on your $3500.00. Combining with Compounding you positions, you are looking at 200% return in a year. (every $350 gain, start with a new set of hedge using 0.1 Lot sizes) Once you reach about 20 standard lots, you are making $220 per day, and that should be a pretty comfortable income, not even counting the positive gains on the GBP/JPY pair. Some of you might ask about the drawdown on this, I have seem a maximum of 15% drawdown. The market might be a little more unforgiving at first, but once you start to spread out your position, like entering a new mini-lot set everyday for 10 days straight, you are actually minimizing your exposure. Always use discretion to do this and once you are in profit with your GBP/JPY pair for about 100 PIPS, put your stop/loss at 1 PIP profit, only use stop with GBP/JPY pair, and if you are not at your computer all the time, setup the EMAIL function in MT4 and send yourself a text message telling you that you got stopped out on the GBP/JPY. If the market moves against you with the GBP/JPY, you will get stopped out at 1 PIP, but your CHF/JPY, USD/CHF, and GBP/USD short orders will be profitable. Another thing to watch out for when doing this trade is to do it on Wednesday, which is triple interest day. So it will pretty much cover your spread and give you a positive swap the very first day. And it might take up to 4 days to see your account being positive, but again, your initial entry is the most important entry.

Neo, q about your system? When would you close any of your trades? Would the gains from the swap enough to cover any of the loses from the open positions? does it matter if the market is ranging or trending? thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Did you take the different lot sizes into account? I'm not sure about FXDD but all my GBP pairs are just 70,000 units per lot instead of 100,000. That should leave you short 30,000 units of USD/JPY. Just something to consider...

--- 帖子 #4 ---
that sounds very interesting and similar to the freedom rocks system. But I don't know that much about hedging systems so anything would impress me.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
The only downside to this system is that you do need to be attentive to what's going on as even though the four way square you have set up might be tightly correlated, there will always be that one time when it's not; and what will you do about that? Your system has a good setup out the gate, but I would like to pick your brain about your worst case scenario solutions? At the same time, do you ever actively close and reset positions that are just too profitable to leave alone, like being up 150 pips or so in a pair? Like I said, it seems like a more "ground-level/passive" system, but what are your active maneuvers with the system?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Basically you will let your system run and collect SWAP indefinitely. You will not close any trades. But then, when you are making swaps and making PIPS as well, like I am in my 50K account, when I am up 20%, I will just withdraw that out of my bank. Just remember, you have to close by sets. You cannot close the winning pairs and leave the losing pairs running. You open a set of 4 pairs, and when you close, you must close the same lots of the sets. This system is relatively safe, and since GBP/JPY has been the focus of my carry trade, you just have to enter the market at a good time. I suggest after a major retracement then prepare your entry.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I do all 100K lots. Maybe you have a different broker? You just have to make sure that You are buying the same size and selling the same size on all pairs.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I don't use FreedomRocks. This system was first presented to me by using an original 2 Pairs hedging. Then I read somewhere that you can actually do a 3 Pair Heding, and I digged a little deeper, even created myself a 10 Pair hedging, but the interest was very low, like $4.00 per day or something. It involved AUD, NZD, CHF, JPY, GBP, USD, and CAD. I guess from an Institutional view of that strategy, a 50% return per year was good enough, if you trade big money. SO I tried different combos and finally I found the best combo is what I have listed in my first post. Again, if your broker use MT4 and pay good swap, then this will work for you. This is better than the 3 pair Hedging, which is devastating for your account in the event of a drawdown. The best combination that I have found and most stable is the 10 Pair Hedging that I have deviced, that will only create a 3% drawdown max. A relative safer way, if you ask me. Anyways, sorry for the ranting.

The problem my friend, is not correlation. We are not depending on correlation to hedge our position. Lets say that you BUY 1 LOT of EUR/USD and Sell 1 LOT of EUR/USD, what correlation are you depending on? The same rule apply here. You are basically creating a perfect circle that eventually comes back to itself. If you further examine the idea behind this hedging, you will see that it is absolutely dependent on the market's supply and demand. But sometimes the market is not perfect, or people will overreact to certain events or sentiments, and that is when you start to see unbalanced market pricing. The whole purpose of this is not to gain the pips, but to create a constant swap payments. I have to admit that is it tempting sometimes to want to cash out, but then again I don't sit in front my PC all day and watch this. This is one of those "set it and forget it" type of thing. I would recommend that anyone doing this, to enter a 10th of your position and gradually add to it so you can spread out your position. This will add more security. Now during the recent selloff on the GBP/JPY where the market went 1600 PIPS in a short amount of time, my system was able to keep the maximum drawdown to a NET of 200 PIPS, because the GBP/USD CHF/JPY and USD/CHF were all positive, the relative drawdown on the GBP/JPY of 1600 PIP was effectively cancelled by the positive movement of the other pairs. Now that is taken the worst scenario into account and say that you entered the market at the absolute top. If you have entered sooner, like I did, you will have placed the 1 PIP stop on your winning position, and the movement would have been positive, since the other pairs are gaining. The only part where you will actively close your positions will be that when the GBP/JPY position is stopped out, you have in essence an unbalanced equation, and you will need to close as soon as they are positive, or trail stop them. That is done by experience. Just remember, if the GBP/JPY is dropping, the CHF/JPY will drop too, because generally the JPY is strong. The GBP/USD will drop, because there are too many GBP in the market, supply and demand laws will make GBP weaker. The 4th Pair USD/CHF will be stronger, but you will have 2 Pairs hedging against 1, so you are still a 2:1 ratio on that. This is just the scenario if there is a selloff on the GBP/JPY. My current position on GBP/JPY is about 560 PIPS in profit, I entered on the 28th of March and I just added to my position yesteday, which I am up about 16 PIPS. But remember, you are not trying to cashout the pips, you are trying to stay in the game long enough and get swap. But if you are going on vacation and you need to close all positions, then do it, you might actually net couple hundred pips. neo

Without taking any strength away from what is being discussed here, there is a group trading a dual hedge that each day they place one micro lot in the direction of positive swap on two particular pairs (GBPJPY and GBPCHF). I wonder how something like this might work into what is going on here? You mentioned taking 1/10th positions to build your portfolio/trades. Maybe doing something like a micro lot each day per each pair would gradually let one into this and gain confidence in the process? Doing so, as per the particular group's testing yeilds the following: Interest earned on 400:1 account is approximately as follows: Month 1 $90 Month 2 $288 Month 3 $478 Month 4 $667 (now 1.2 lots long 100k each) ...so there might be some use to such a build up. By the end of month one you would have built up to 30 micro lots on each pair as you do a tripple each Wednesday if i've got the figures right. Just rambling and interested in seeing other's succeed! Cheers, Thom

Interesting, you've obviously put a lot of thought into this so thanks for sharing. One question I have is about pip value. As each currency pair has a different dollar cost for each pip, GBP/USD pip is $10 but GBP/JPY is around $8.50, if you're using the same lot sizes on each pair doesn't that make the hedge unbalanced? Just for an example, say you entered all the trades on Jan 1st 2002 and left them alone. You would be up in terms of pips (1,368) but because of the different pip values you'd be in the red. I'm just starting to look at hedges so if anyone can clear that up - great. Cheers

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Well, if you have been in for that long just the swap will probably make you a rich man, provided that you have been doing some spreading out of your position throughout the years. Remember thats $11.00 per day x 365 x 5 years = $20,0075.00 in swap alone, if you started with a $5,000 account doing only 1 set of 4 pairs. As far as PIP value, I guess that is an interesting question. This strategy may need to be fine tuned a little bit to take into account of PIP value and actual LOT sizes, but since many broker offers only standard 10K or 100K sizes, it will be difficult unless you trade at OANDA with unit sizes. Last time I checked, OANDA does pay good SWAP for GBP/JPY, so it would be interesting to get the exact Unit size. But then let's not be too anal (excuse the expression) about that, the market is not perfect, if the market was perfect, then this hedge will cancel out all movements and give you what some people refer to "impeccable hedge"

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Yes. You are absolutely right. The only problem with the GBP/CHF and GBP/JPY is that you are not covered 100%. You always have higher risk exposure because you are now depending on correlation of the currencies. I have been burned by that and that is why I decided to do it this way instead of the other hedging. Remember, all these hedging ideas work fine until there is a selloff and then is either you blow up your account or you lose all the profit gained. My system will protect you far more than that, but then again you are not making the $22.00 or $17.00 swap per day.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
At the risk of sounding more "anal" (I tend to be about hard cash ) Taking pip value at $8.5 for the yen pairs, $8.1 for USD/CHF and of course $10 for cable a 4 trade basket would look like this: G/U - 10 mini lots (1 standard lot) G/J and C/J - 11 or 12 U/C - 12 ---------------------- G/U - 15 mini lots G/J and C/J - 18 U/C - 18 or 19 So obviously the higher you go, the more you need to be aware of this difference.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
thx for the kind regards bhoy : ) . . . and it looks like you are onto the right idea on the pip factoring. It's fairly simple math, and some trade stations such as FXSol's (demo and live) have pip value tables to make it even easier. Neo, you are right on the risk. My intent on mentioning that particular hedge was only the ramping up concept that you had touched on with your 1/10th entry in lue of full lots at a time. Again the idea of adding say one micro lot or some combination of equality-in-micro-lots thinking of what has been pointed out in the above posts on getting the market-presence equal between pairs with the differeing pip value. Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hello traders and Neo1001, I love the concept, and have worked on similar projects before. But with all due respect, I can not understand how you are receiving swap on this system. When I run the numbers with some of the brokers I know of, I find the swap to be either negative OR at the best it is break even. An example from MIG shows the following: Long GBP/JPY gives you +1.90 Short CHF/JPY you pay -0.55 Short GBP/USD you pay 0.00 Short USD/CHF you pay -1.35 TOTAL SWAP = 0 interest paid! That is the best example I could find. I tried the broker you mentioned, but their swap rates where not posted. IF there is a way to do this, I am extremely interested. Thank you for your response. Good Trades, Yukoner

From IBFX

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Great work! So BUY 1.1 Lot of GBP/JPY SELL 1.0 Lot of GBP/USD SELL 1.2 Lot of USD/CHF SELL 1.2 Lot of CHF/JPY That about right?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
What I would recommend is that you open a DEMO account and do it on a DEMO to see how my concept would work. Open a DEMO with FXDD and start with 1 lot of each pair. Some of the swap rate posted are based on the Base Currency, so you have to really calculate it and find out. The best way is to do it with a DEMO. BTW, the Short Pair GBP/USD is not 0.0, is actually receiving positive swap due to last rate hike. Its like 0.03 per lot. Low but nevertheless positive. Neo

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Based on this rate, you are looking at $8.10 per day. If you look for better brokers, you might achieve the $11.30 that I am getting.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Ok, makes sense as long as you have a broker who will allow you to do it... and your position sizes are properly correlated with each other for pip movement. I like the idea of arbing capital gains should the positions give you positive NAV. It would be interesting to consider the use of options in this strategy. I haven't really had the time to think it through, but a person might be able to be long a put in the high yielding currencies of gbp and usd. This would give you a hedge, WITHOUT paying interest... but obviously you pay the premium for the put. It would drastically increase your daily swap!! AND it gives potential for capital gains appreciation in the spot forex. The premiums on the options would determine if this is viable. (I'll try to sit down and figure this out over the weekend). Good Trades, Yukoner

I have a question about the payout of the swaps. I thought they are only paid (or subtracted) if you actually close your positions. So they are accumulating, just like your P/L, but you don't get the results until you close. If that's the case than you would have to close every now and then to benefit from the interest payments. I believe that OANDA works differently in that they pay interest even if positions are open. I thinks that's why they now have a rule that limits the length of open positions.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Swaps are paid or charged to your account on a daily basis as long as you keep your positions open overnight.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
You have account balance and account equity. Your equity value will actually increase while your account balance is the same. What really matter is your equity. So if you have enough equity to cover the margin, you should be able to withdraw funds, even if your account is low. But if you want to see your account reflect your equity value, then you can close your positions and see it. I for one, have done withdrawals and there is no problem whatsoever, and my equity accurately reflects my swap balance.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thx for sharing ur strategy, its worth trying but i just visited fxdd.com and it doesnt look like they pay swap on any pairs check it out http://fxdd.com/rolloverrates.html

--- 帖子 #26 ---
They sure don't on the weekend. Check tomorrow.

Using FXDD Demo account swap rates, these will net $8.95 swaps daily. Interesting. From where I look at it, you are: GBP Neutral (0 GBP position) CHF Short -100K CHF USD Long +98K (or 0.98 standard lots) JPY Short - 1.947M JPY Which effectively means at current closing prices after Friday13th: Long USDCHF 0.82 Lots = +$5.30 swap Long USDJPY 0.163 Lots = +$1.913 swap Total : $7.21 The discrepancy between $7.21 and 8.95 is from the lower swaps FXDD give on USDCHF ($6.46) and USDJPY ($11.74) whereas other brokers give as much as $10 for USDCHF and $13 for USDJPY... So neo, once you see a big USD sell off vs CHF and JPY, you will get hurt in pippage.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi, Neo1001 Thank you for sharing your system I would like to add a suggestion I am demo trading GBP/USD and USD/JPY this is kind of a hedge system, the Ratio I do is 1 GBP/USD, 1.5 USD/JPY. Then if GBP/USD drops 60 pips I buy 0.02 lot which is 1/50 of the original purchase and immediately set a take profit of 60 pips. If GBP/USD gains 60 pips I close 0.02 of the original lot purchased and take that little profit. I do the same with the USD/JPY so that way when one pair gains the other loose but then when the reverse comes I gain. By trading 1/50 of the lots purchased does not offset the hedge too much. And increase profits considerably. I was thinking if you apply this concept to your 4 pairs it would be twice profit from my 2 pair hedge system. My suggestion is GBP/JPY lots to trade 0.02 @ 100 pips CHF/JPY lots to trade 0.02 @ 100 pips GBP/USD lot to trade 0.02 @ 60 pips USD/CHF lots to trade 0.02 @ 60 pips I will personally demo this system because if it is working with 2 pairs I think it will work much better with 4 pairs.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
when u buy 0.02 lots to take profits at 60pips where do u place ur stop or u dont put stop infact the same question goes to neo and u too......for the hedging strategy u really dont use any stop losses at least initially right??

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Don't forget kids, swap is paid triple on Wednesdays. The reason it's paid triple on Wednesdays is because even though it's a "spot" market, trades are declared to be settled up two days from their transaction date, and thusly you have to be able to cover the interest rates for the days of the weekend, and Wednesday is...two days after the weekend! Ancient chinese secret...?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
You don’t set stops, because some pair will be in profit and some will be losing so they balance each other, but you got to have enough money to cover any sell offs a good rule that I use is never use more than 5% margin with 1:400 leverage or 20% with 1:100

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi there Muniz I am new to hedging and don't quite understand fully your system here. Do you place a buy and sell for each pair? you mentioned 1 lot to 1.5 lot. And what are the 100 pips, 60 pips you are talking about? I thought we are after the swap with neo's stratety, waht does these pips have to do with it? thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I am demo trading GBP/USD and USD/JPY this is kind of a hedge system, the Ratio I do is 1 GBP/USD, 1.5 USD/JPY. I understand from the underlined text above that you go Long GBPUSD 1 Lot and Long USDJPY 1.5 lots. 1.0 Lot GBPUSD = +100KGBP, -198.66KUSD 1.5 Lot USDJPY = +150K USD, -17.886M JPY This equate to almost going Long 0.8 Lot GBPJPY. You all should understand the underlying fact on your hedges. This hedging works because GBPJPY is uptrending after the Feb crash. There is no MAGIC why it works. And Munizdivisas suggestion is plain trading GBPJPY. And neo's suggestion is just the same its purely long USDCHF, long USDJPY. If you want to trade Munizdivisas system, I suggest you to open position when GBPJPY dips. And to trade Neo's system, I suggest you to open position when USDCHF and USDJPY dips. Safe as you might think these hedging pairs appear but these all have drawdowns if you look at the underlining fact. So Hedge carefully. It is not SAFE as it seems. Freedomrocks has been a long running success; alot of traders went it with big money. Yet they all lost huge money when the Feb CHF, JPY rally last late February - why? because their underlying fact in the system was based on bullish EURCHF and GBPCHF. It is so easy to get Novices attracted to systems when "SAFE" is attached. How come Long GBPJPY is not called SAFE when in fact, for 2 years, its nothing but uphill climb?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I don't quite follow the 0.82 LOT and 0.163 LOT reference. I know that I am doing 100K LOT on 4 Pairs. I am LONG only on GBP/JPY I am short on the other 3 Pairs. CHF/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CHF Well, are you logging into FXDD and see what Swap rate they are posting on their platform or are you actually following my strategy and see the 7.21 swap? I am in the trade live and I am telling you, its $11.30 per day. On a USD Selloff you are going to have USD/CHF going down, where your USD/CHF Short position will be gaining considerably. Your GBP/USD position will gain as well, which will go against you since you are going short, but your GBP/JPY will get a boost because of the stronger GBP. Your CHF/JPY will probably also go up, but this pair is so much more timid compared to GBP/JPY, the movement on GBP/JPY will probably cover all your losses then some. Go ahead and try my hedge for a couple weeks, then let me know what you think. Please, do it on a DEMO account, as I would advice anyone to start out with.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
u dont place stop losses even for the additional 0.02lots u add later for 80 pips profit taking, wat if it goes against u like 100 or more also, did u mean 20% for 400:1 and 5% for 1:100 leverage??

--- 帖子 #36 ---
You don't use a stop/loss because you are hedging. Many people might have concerns on the movement that think that it might wipe you out. But remember that the market is purely supply and demand. It will always workout. The biggest fear of this strategy is with GBP/JPY. But understanding the idea behind carry trades, you will see that it is very unlikely for this pair to drop, since that just does not make sense. There might be a short market sentiment to drive the pair down, but it always comes back due to the major difference on Interest Rate. If only GBP/JPY is going down, and you are seeing the GBP is strong against all other currencies, such as GBP/USD. Then you can definitely bet that the market will come back and consolidate its losses. Just remember, many Japanese big names were secretly going long on the GBP/JPY during the recent sell off that took more than 1600 PIPS. But then again, you might ask, what make this system so interesting? It is because the fact that you are really dealing with the Major Currencies in the world, and like the law of Relativity, that you cannot destroy energy, but simple transfer the energy to another medium. Same with the Forex. When money changes medium, it will tend to balance itself out, there might be times of unbalanced moments, but it will always work out. By Hedging 4 Pairs, you are looking at spreading your risk. That is what this is about.

I understand u neo, i was actually referring to the gentmen/lady who said he buys extra 0.02 lots for 60 pips whenerever a pair goes down 60 pips.....my question is for d single extra pair of 0.02 lots how do u place stop loss for that or u dont and y?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Well said. I have to say that nothing is "SAFE" in forex. However, if you enter your position right, and you lock in your 1 PIP as I suggested, you are pretty safe, even considering the Feb. Selloff on the GBP/JPY. Is just how you do this. Remember, giving the same signal, same strategy, same broker, same account size, and even using identical PC's and Internet Connection, 2 people might take the same trade and one will come out winning while the other one come out losing.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
You don’t place stop/lost you just wait until the market corrects and take profit, it might take some time but it will correct. What I was try to show neo is that it might be possible get extra profits by buying small lots (Which yes is the FreedomRocks concept)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Correction to my earlier post, i thought it was +GBPJPY, -CHFJPY, -GBPUSD and -USDJPY , when it was -USDCHF! I appologize for the error! My mistake back there.. you can verify that my number back there were referring indeed to short USDJPY.. These 4 pairs can be broken down into the bare numbers: Long GBPJPY means Buy 100K GBP and Sell 23.68M JPY Short CHFJPY means Sell 100K CHF and Buy 9.814M JPY Short GBPUSD means Sell 100K GBP and Buy 198.66K USD Short USDCHF means sell 100K USD and Buy 121.46K CHF According to the above, you are: NET zero GBP as you bought and sold the same amount of GBP in two different pairs. NET BUY 98.66K USD (from short GBPUSD and Short USDCHF) NET BUY 21.46K CHF (from short USDCHF and short CHFJPY) NET SELL 13.866M JPY (from long GBPJPY and short CHFJPY) to have net short 13.866M JPY, you have to buy 1.16 Lots USDJPY to have net long 21.46K CHF, you have to sell 0.177 lots USDCHF Therefore: Long GBPJPY Short GBPUSD Short CHFJPY Short USDCHF is equivalently: Long 1.16 Lots USDJPY Short 0.177 Lots USDCHF With these knowledge, you can now plug your SWAP rates for the LIVE FXDD account and see you are getting more than NET $10 daily swaps on your original positions. 1.16 Long USDJPY alone would now net you $12.76, while the miniscule short 0.177 USDCHF might deduct just 3 quarters a most so you will still be $12 in swaps based on this broken down lottage. I beleive traders like mrMikal, smjones, merlin will agree to these blue highlighted bare lottage numbers. So to take on Neo's hedge, position yourself when USDJPY dips and when USDCHF rises. neo, to confirm my 1.16 Long USDJPy and short 0.177 USDCHF vs your 4 pair positions, can you post your sample positions and I will give you the corresponding pip profits using my USDJPY + USDCHF pairs. No thanks. I'd rather go LONG USDJPY when it drops below 115 and per every 100 pips below but not now when it is sitting 119+. Trading USDJPY is far more dangerous than it seems. Im currently hedging EUR, GBP, CHF, USD, NZD instead on live account (10 standard lots variants) - not the freedom rock scenario though but something similar. My biggest winner is NZD as shown. Of course I also have big loosers like GBPUSD as I shorted it below 1.94.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Neo, Can I just confirm that you only exit gbp/jpy when you go into +100 pips profit? When you are in a losing position with gbp/jpy you sit it out and wait for it to come back? At that time (could be months) do you continue to add to your positions using the swap profits? BurgerKing, Would love to hear more on your hedge system using the different pairs you just mentioned.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I have been doing carry trades live with real money since more than one year My open positions are: Buy GBPJPY 1 lot Sell CHFJPY 2 lots Sell GBPUSd 1 lots I have seen a swing of negative as well as a positive difference of about 1000 pips i.e my account at a time was about -$ 10000 and another time was $ + $10000

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Based on current rates: (ie after April 13th) Buy GBPJPY 1 lot = Buy 100K GBP, Sell 23.685M JPY Sell CHFJPY 2 lots = Sell 200K CHF, Buy 19.628M JPY Sell GBPUSD 1 lots = Sell 100K GBP, Buy 198.66K USD Effectively, * GBP neutral, you do not hold any GBP in your hands as it is fully hedged USD Long 198.66K JPY Short 4.057M Short CHF 200K which is equivalent to: Long 1.65 Lots USDCHF = (+165K USD, - 200KCHF) Long 0.34 Lots USDJPY = (+34K USD, - 4.05M JPY) These lottage are dependent on current currency prices. Do not be mistaken to assume that these lot ratios are valid for last year but only from this day. By Wednesday, the ratio will be different. If you could tell us what are prices of your GBPJPY, CHFJPY and GBPUSD positions, I can better give you your actual equivalent positions.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Once you understand how to break down a position or several positions into bare currencies like i was doing in my last posts, you will have better idea how good/bad a hedging system works. Perhaps I'd give you a simple idea: Go Long EURCHF. Trigger, Plot Bollinger and RSI on H1 Wait for price to touch bottom of Band. Confirm with RSI &lt; 40. Proper Money Management is required. If you plan to expose 50% of your money in this system, expose only 2% on your 1st position. additional 2% everytime the price kept touching down consecutively. once you are in profit, close em and wait for the next opportunity. Remember, 2% only each time even if you are willing to risk 50% in the long term. Heck I'd be happy with just 1%.. A hedge fund is not a sprint. Its a Marathon! In case yo managed to find a good profit (ie, a short cut path to your marathon) TAKE IT! Hedge Fund is giving consistent albeit small profit to clients.

Burger King and others, Just wondering if you have ever traded options as a combination with your forex trades? I agree with you about properly structuring your trades to truly reflect a pure hedge. Let me throw out an idea from my earlier post regarding how a trader might setup the same hedge but use put options instead of shorting high interest pairs. These are rough numbers, but close to current conditions. Long Spot FX in GBP/JPY giving + $20.55 in swap. Short Spot FX in CHF/JPY paying - $3.35 in swap. Short Spot FX in GBP/USD giving + 0.30 in swap TOTAL SWAP $17.50 Long one June usd/chf PUT option at a strike price of 1.2100 would cost $1270 to buy. It would expire June 14th. This is like owning 1 lot, or 100,000 units and having the right, but not the obligation to be short usd/chf from 1.2100 anytime before June 14th. The cost is based on buying at market, not trying to trade into it. For the sake of time, I haven't gotten into the exact amounts of spot FX you need to own to balance out the position to neutral cash risk. This was pointed out in an early post. I just wanted to throw out this concept and see if anyone is doing this............? The reason for going with an option is that you don't pay $9.40 per day which up to June 14th would add up to approximately $550 of interest. The option costs more ($1270) and that could be somewhat covered by the interest that is made from the other pairs (Approx. $1032 by June 14th). Another potential loss is the pip movement from wherever usd/chf was when you setup this hedge idea. Currently 1.2133, so minus 1.2100 and leaves a "potential" loss of 33 pips or $271.92. SO WHY DO THIS? It leaves you long USD, where your account can capture any potential bullish movement in the USD, and worst case scenario you are going to lose $541.92 (Disclaimer: These numbers are very close, but don't allow for slippage, spread cost for entering the trade, or my tired brain) Because you have the right, but not the obligation to be short usd/chf from 1.2100 it also leaves you short gbp/usd. Pretend that USD rallies 200 pips in about 59 days from now. June 14 here is what happens: The put option you bought on usd/chf expires worthless. GBP/JPY is wherever it is, and chf/jpy is most likely range bound (Should CHF get some crazy bullish news, you might have to exercise your worthless put option in order to balance out the hedge) The short GBP/USD is in the money by 200 pips, which is now putting $2000 in your account. Total profit of the account in 59 days, would be about $1750. Giving you a risk/reward of approx. 1:3 Obviously you can calculate the same thing happening, with a 20 pip gain or 400 pip gain, instead of a 200 pip gain. This example has a direction bias, which is bullish USD... but you could easily do the same thing and be bullish GBP or NZD or whatever currency you pick. AND if your broker pays better swap, then that might make up for my rounding off calculations. However, when I look at this, because of the directional bias it might be just as well to do a bull call spread in USD/CHF going long 1.2100 call and short 1.2300 call for a net cost of $660 and potential gain of $1340. This example isn't the greatest one, but I wanted to take the time to throw it out for discussion, poke holes in it, etc. If someone wanted to be LONG USD with very low risk for the next couple of months, this is one way to do it. Good Trades, Yukoner

It was extremely unfortunate that Forex Factory crashed just after I posted some heavy numbers supporting my claim about Neo's 4 pairs vs my 2 pair equivalent. But for the sake of everyone not in the know, I'd post those numbers once more. According to Neo's statement: I'd like to put that to the test by taking positions during Feb 26 to Mar 2 when the currency market had a big selloff. Neo's 4 Pair Hedge Open prices of the following pairs as of Feb 25, 18:00 EST Long GBPJPY 237.74 Short GBPUSD 1.9643 Short CHFJPY 98.23 Short USDCHF 1.2315 Close prices as of Mar 2 16:00 EST GBPJPY 226.97 = - 1077 pips @$8.56 per pip = -$9219.12 GBPUSD 1.9432 = +211 pips @$10 per pip = +$2110 CHFJPY 95.99 = +224 pips @8.56 per pip = +$1917.44 USDCHF 1.2165 = +150 pips @$8.22 per pip = +$1233 TOTAL P/L = -$3958.68 I was wondering why USDCHF did not bail you out as you strongly worded above? Please do not give such "unfounded" statement not knowing the numbers to back such claim. Novices are so easily tempted only to loose big time.. BurgerKing's 2 Pair Equivalent Open prices of the following pairs as of Feb 25, 18:00 EST Long 1.16 Lots USDJPY @121.04 Short 0.177 Lots USDCHF @1.2315 Close prices as of Mar 2 16:00 EST USDJPY 116.81 = -490.68 pips @$8.56 per pip = -$4200.22 USDCHF 1.2165 = +26.55 pips @8.22 per pip = +$218.241 TOTAL P/L = $3981.98 Difference is less than 1%. This is an extremely accurate equivalent. Is it Coincidence? Is it Magic? Or is it plain and absolute fact? Be noted that I am not discouraging anyone about Neo's 4 Pair Hedge. What I have been telling people is WHEN to enter this Hedge. Based on my 2 Pair equivalent, this 4 pair hedge is 85% Long USDJPY and 15% short USDCHF. Therefore, what I have said before and I'd said it again, enter when USDJPY makes a dip because this is predominantly Long USDJPY. Should USDCHF make 6 times more volatility than USDJPY then and only then would I tell you to watch for USDCHF instead.

BurgerKing: I have to say that I am very impressed with your work, and I think you have done a remarkable job in shooting holes in my trade. But I have to respectafully disagree with you on your comments on what I have posted here. You have taken my strategy out of context, and you have created a scenario that is highly unlikely and extreme prejudicial in looking at my trade. As I have pointed out before, if based on your theory, that someone would enter the trade at 2/25 18:00EST, which is not the time that I suggest entry, nor the exact manner which I suggested entry. As I matter of fact if I recall, my entries were timed just before the market close, and to be entered at a mini-lot or 1-10th of position per day if the final goal was to enter a full lot set. After 10 days, instead of seeing red, you should have been seeing profit. If you do you numbers on a daily basis, which I really don't have the time to get it done right now, I would post a daily P/L based on 10th entry for 10 days, and you will see that after 10 days, we are still out with a positive income. To further explore my options, if at 2/25 the orders are already in place, then a stop of 1 PIP protection will be placed on all GBP/JPY long orders. Based on your own number, at the end of day 3/2 you will actually see + $5,260.44 PLUS whatever swap accumulated and $8.56 for that 1 PIP I guess it is very easy to look at a theory or strategy and tear it down for kicks. But if you do not follow the manner which the strategy is meant to work and enter the protective stops as suggested, then why would you want to follow my strategy in the first place? You cannot pick and choose parts of my strategy and say, "hey, I like this part" and ignore the others. What you are posting here is misleding the novice traders as you are accusing me of doing , and at the same time you are practically taking my words out of its context and twisting it. If I were to use your straddle script on multiple pairs and then I say "BurgerKing's script don't work, it caused my broker to lock my platform", Don't use it because you will get stuck in a trade and can't get out. You would probably call me an idiot and say to read your post about that and your warning of what might happen. But what if I choose to ignore that and do it anyways and show you proof that your script don't work (screenshots, video recording of platform lockup, etc..), how would you feel? Furthermore, what you are doing here is curve-fitting the results with my strategy. The same thing you are doing now I can do as well and show you a remarkable return by picking a period on the chart. And I am sure if I were to do that, I can absolutely show you a gain of more than that $3981.98 number you end up with. Anyways, I do not appreciate being flamed at for sharing my strategy, especially the flamer does not even take the time to read my post correctly in the first place. I respect you and what you have contributed, BurgerKing, but I have to say what you are doing here I do not agree with. If you feel that your "Hedge" is a much better option than mine, then by all means please start a thread and show us, instead of hijacking my thread and use it to show your hedge. Thats just how I feel, I apologize if I used any harsh words there, but sometimes I get a little heated in an intellectual debate such as this. neo

Hi everybody. Nice thread and nice system neo. I'm glad to see that we have trader who realy understand about hedge working out together to make a nice system! Hey Neo don't get me wrong but I have a little question and i won't make a thread just for this question =)... Here it goes... What if we Buy EUR/USD and Buy USD/CHF looking for $2,05 swap at 1 standard lot each? Cause U/Ch and E/U is extremely correlated about 93% 1 year trailling... And dollar should go up at sometime since U/Ch have a daily range greater than E/U we will be in nice profit at sometime... I'm just want to know if you guys think that is good enought for a hedge Thanks for any reply and lets keep this thread rolling up Regards

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Neo1001, I'm curious what broker are you using to get the postive results. I'm currently using Interbankfx and all of my hedged positions have a overall negative affect in swap? I use hedging on a daily basis, but I'm loosing swap $'s daily. Thanks for your insight and posting your thought on Forexfactory. I'm always open to new ideas. Especially if they can make profit. yezbick

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi i like your system, and i agree on the theory that you have in affect created a loop effectively 100% hedged but not 100% correlated. Unless a country decides to print more money the system should remain quite stable. Some questions below - 1. - I guess you Equalize all lots sizes? 2. - What lot size is the ratio per $1000 in your account (eg 1 mini per 1000 in the account) ? to acheive 10% a month. 3. You mention you set 1 pip SL then you say you shouldn't close trades, im confused? do you have a seperate system running taking profit? 4. - Can i see the setup for the 10 hedge system? 5. - You also said you do i tenth at a time. i guess so you spread out the trades through the different stages of draw down/ profit. 6. - How and when do you compound, weekly monthly? If you have 10 sets running i would guess you could close out one that is break even and open a new one with the bigger lots running. 7. - If you do take a profit on trades can you take profit on both sides. meaning you can come into the market many times taking profit without burying your self in the corner? Thanks

Hello: Thank you for you kind comments. The reason why I am doing a short with USD/CHF is because that we are shorting the CHF/JPY. If we were to use the EUR/JPY, then we have to go long on the EUR/USD, which will give you 2 negative swap on a daily basis, both the EUR/JPY and EUR/USD pair. Remember, as a basic definition of hedge, we are trying to cancel out our positions and gaining a positive swap. Also the fact that shorting the EUR/JPY will definitely cost you a higher swap. Let me illustrate: Original Scenario 1 Lot Long GBP/JPY $23.87 1 Lot Shor CHF/JPY -$ 3.34 1 Lot Shor USD/CHF -$10.46 1 Lot Shor GBP/USD $ 0.29 Total Swap per day = $10.36 (For today) Rates varies. Alternate Scenario 1 Lot Long GBP/JPY $23.87 1 Lot Shor EUR/JPY -$12.85 1 Lot Long EUR/USD -$6.66 1 Lot Shor GBP/USD $ 0.29 Total Swap per day = $4.66

I use FXDD and I think even FXLQ do pay good swap. I heard someone talking about Oanda being good at paying swap, but they have a limit now on how much swap will be paid or something like that. So far my experience is with FXDD and they are pretty decent. I won't go out and endorse them, but I am just telling you my experience.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
WOW, thats a lot of questions to answer. I will do my best to answer them. 1. I trade one standard lot per currency pair per SET. That means when I enter a trade I enter 4 orders, with 1 LONG GBP/JPY and 3 Short (CHF/JPY, USD/CHF, and GBP/USD) 2. I have a 200:1 leveraged account. The total margin is about $2800. However, I will not get a margin call unless I am at 10% equity, which means that for $2800 margin, my total account equity will need to fall below $280 to be get margin called. I would recommend that you get at least $3500 in your account to do this to achieve 10% monthly, but it will be much safer to have at least $5000 to start this set. 3. Since this hedge is dependent on GBP/JPY, when you are in profit of 100 PIPS or more, you need to place a SL on GBP/JPY at 1 point above your entry. This is primarily to prevent any market crash or overreaction as seen recently. You only have to place this on the GBP/JPY pair, and once it is stopped out, all your other pairs should be positive or close to be positive. Then you can close them manually. This is not a separate system, but the same system but with a different exit strategy. 4. Yes, I will show them in a different thread once I have done forward testing of them. 5. The idea is to enter 1/10th of your position and take 10 days to enter them all. So that each day you might enter the market at different price and spread out your risk. Just make sure that every GBP/JPY order when they reach 100PIP of profit you do lock in that 1 PIP so if the market comes back, you can then close the remaining 3 pairs that you entered along with that order. Do this as the market stops your GBP/JPY. 6. Actually you do not close any sets. You just keep on adding to it. Lets say that you will set aside $3500 for each FULL LOT SETS. So everytime you have a $350 of profit, then you can do a mini-set. Just keep on adding to your position and set that 1 PIP stop. Also DO NOT close positions when break even or little profit, HEDGE is a different beast all together. You are not there to scalp the market to quick profit. You are there to stay in the market and make swap daily. All of your margin and equity should be used to handle the movement. The only reason you would close a hedge is when you are going on vacation, there is a major news that can affect your hedge tremendously, and/or you just couldn't resist the temptation of the huge money your are making and you want to cash out. Also remember when you add a new position, you gotta pay the broker spread. SO don't close your positions so you can consolidate a new bigger position, you will end up paying double spread. 7. It is possible, but the market is unpredictable. Hedge will give you the illusion that you are making money on one pair, but once you close the profitable pair, the market might keep on going, so the loser pairs becomes bigger, and you will eventually lose money. Even if you are able to time your exit right and make money on both sides, all it takes is one time for you to guess wrong, and the losing pairs will eat you alive. So don't do it, open as a set, and close as a set. Or don't hedge. neo

Hi Neo, If you don't close your trades, where does the $350 profit come from? Thanks! Ann

--- 帖子 #55 ---
From interest you recived.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks for that neo. that cleared up most of it. Still unsure of the GBPJPY SL. It worries me that you have to protect it. I gather you have so much margin used that you have to be careful. Can you let me know is it 100 pips account profit or just 100 pips profit on the GBPJPY pair. before you implement the SL. If it is the GBPJPY then what if it never reaches a profit? Market drops for a long trend just after opening the hedge trades? Be great to know the boundaries of the Hedge too. How far each way have you seen it go? One more thing opening new trades continuously can't be good long term can you have a read below and let me know what you think. Open 10 or even 20 sets over 10 or 20 days. When you wish to add money to your account (eg fund) or compound swap. Then you can close out the nearest to break even and replace the set with a new set higher in Lot size then for get it. Accounts with FXDD go down to micro so why not use it. This will mean you get hit with an extra spread but a very low one (1 20th infact). You then know you have 20 trades no less no more. I can't see the longevity in a system that continues to add trades (very messy) Let me know your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Neo just a thought but i have an EA (will need some alterations) but you can dial in a negative % of equity (eg -50%) and it will copy the opposing trades effectively locking the account. FXDD has a Zero margin policy ( not a margin offset policy) so you get all your margin back. Let me know the side effects of this as your account is locked but you could turn a negative into a positive and ride the move away for profit?? Or you could just wait till it returns and close it at break even ??

--- 帖子 #58 ---
This hedge strategy is GBP/JPY weighted; it means that when GJ goes up you have profit and when it goes down you lose, that is why you should place a stop on GJ if you get a 100 pip profit and therefore the hedge should be entered at GJ dips, in the hope of a rally to be able to place the protective stop.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
what is this 1 pip stop you are talking about?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
You can see your Equity and your Buying Power Increase. Instead of seeing the account balance increase, your equity will be actually greater than your balance, and when you enter into more trades, it will deduct from your equity as margin, not account balance.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
To answer your question, first of all you will put the SL at 1 PIP when your GBP/JPY, not the sum of all your order, is up 100 PIPS. It is a possibility that your GBP/JPY will never reach the 100 PIPS, that is why I have stated that entry is key for my system. You can plan your entry when the gbp/jpy dips, and there are many other suggestions out there, including using a bolinger band, murray math, pivot point, and even fundamental analysis. I cannot possibly cover all of that, but the good thing about my trade is that even if you enter the market less than perfect, by spreading your risk out in 10 days, you will end up fine. I have seen many times that my order didnt reach the 100 pips initially, but once it is, I will lock in 1 pip with my Stop Loss. Once it is in the 200/300, you can pretty much relax and let it ride. The problem is getting it thru the first few days, (yes, only a few days, although it could seem like an eternity) and once you are there, you are there. As you can see that the market will be unforgiving at times, my first entry to the market resulted me up to 200 PIPS of loss in my gbp/jpy, but my other pairs hedged my position so I was able to handle that storm, I was down to 15% drawdown on my account, but now that gbp/jpy order is up almost 700 PIPS, and my total equity has increase about 25%. This new set was entered on 3/28/2007. Again with my previous explaination, it is financially unsound to close your position and just to pay double on spread. When you are in this hedge business, it is not unheard of to see people having 100~200 orders standing. If merely 20 orders will look messy, then I guess either do it on a demo and get yourself ready for it, or try other methods. One thing will probably help you is to sort your orders by DATE. Since you are entering one set per day, it will be pretty easy to manage your orders and close them accordingly. Its all about getting used to. In scalping you are trying to limit yourself one trade and never leave a trade open overnight, this strategy you want to leave them open for as long as you can.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Neo, if I understand correctly, you open a new set every other month and you are doing this for 10 days ?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I open them when I see an opportunity, and I close them when I am ready to cash out or take a vacation. Usually I will stay in the hedge for a few months, and once I am in I will stay compounding my position as soon as I make enough swap. I will stop when I have about 20 Sets, or $220 per day, then I would wait for my last hedge to get stopped out on GBP/JPY, then I will start closing them. I would then withdraw all my money and leave only my initial amount there when I first open the hedge, and wait for another opportunity to get back in, sometimes I will wait a couple weeks, or sometimes a couple days. Right now my hedge which I have started on 3/28 have about 15 sets, so I am still about 5 more sets to stop entering. Once I am there then I will stop entering new positions and just collect swap. When my last position gets stopped out, I will start to liquidate my entries with profit 1 set at a time. When I do my own hedge, since I am a little more experienced, I do 1 standard lot set at a time, instead of 1 mini lot set, but the idea is the same, I enter on a daily basis. Hope this helps. neo

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi neo im getting my head around this. It seem you have no more than 20 trades approx open at anyone time? which is cool You main goal is to keep trades open to make profit (of course) and to compound. Just looking at the hedge set up and the Swap payout and swap is quite large on the Buy USDCHF. My point is what do you think about protecting your account with a Buy USDCHF instead of a 1 pip SL (this would come on at crisis times run off your equity) You account would be protected and a S*** load more swap comes your way. I haven't thought this right through what do you think? Buy the way it wouldn't take much to automate this in an EA

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Neo, may I know how long have u been trying out the 4 pairs hedge. I used to have a 2 pair hedge (GBPJPY with CHFJPY) which was being wiped out during Feb where GBPJPY dropp 1600pips. Did your 4 pairs ride that one out?&gt;

--- 帖子 #66 ---
MY 4 pair did ride out with a maximum of 15% drawdown. However, many of my sets that I entered later on were stopped out at 1 PIP Profit, but the whole hedge trade overall which I started around Jan. ended up with about a 20% profit for the 2 months (JAN-FEB). I close most of my trades and cleaned up my hedges around the mid of March when the GBP/JPY start to come back, and reenter the market and started my hedge again on the 28th of March. As you can see, the lowest price of GBP/JPY was at 219, and when I restarted the Hedge the price was at 230. Even with about 1100 PIPS late into the trend, I am still able to make a decent profit.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Ok, I'm trying out this hedge system on an FXUniversal (FXSol) demo account. They allow you to change your leverage and contract size easily so I set it up for 200:1 leverage and a contract size of 1,000 units per lot. I entered this morning with these orders: Buy 11 lots of GBP/JPY Sell 10 lots of GBP/USD Sell 12 lots of USD/CHF Sell 12 lots of CHF/JPY These are based on the ratios given in post #18 but with 1/10 standard lots instead of full lots. We'll see how it goes. So far they are balancing each other nicely. Bruce

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Neo Sorry about the above figures i pasted them in from a statement. See below All opened on 17/ April 2007 at 06.24 Buy - GBPJPY - 238.03 Sell - GBPUSD -1.9894 Sell - USDCHF -1.2134 Sell - CHFJPY - 98.54 My impression here is i should have put a 1 pip sl above break even at 100+ on the GBPJPY. Just making sure we're on the same page. You would have hit the 100+ at 17 april 11.00 It would have lost about $500 (50pips) on the 1 pip stop above break even had i closed all the trades down at that time. I realise that the trades should be spaced out but that would still cost 50USD (1/10th) Or do you keep your other 3 trades open till they go into profit. If so this would mean you are making profit from other means other than just Swap?? Thanks

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Well maybe FXSol is not so good for this method. Here's the breakdown of the swap today: GBP/JPY +2.00 CHF/JPY -4.32 GBP/USD -5.94 USD/CHF -6.65 Could be because they change their interest rates depending on the leverage. Sounds like with 200:1 leverage, they might charge more of a fee for rolling over the trades. Plus now the GBP/JPY trade on this hedge is down 140 pips after the huge drop today.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Somebody explain this to me... You are depending on gbp/jpy to go up... or the usd. And as I see it, because of the difference in currency exchange. (1 LOT does not mean the same in another currency.) you have basically just created a position that is esentially long. Am i wrong here? Why not just trade smaller size, no hedge at all, and ride out the 15% drawdown. It is basically the same thing IMO. I could sit here and write out the actually exposure.... but let me leave it at this. Long 1 lot gbp/jpy does not give you the same YEN Exposure as short 1 lot chf/jpy. Good Trades, Yukoner

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Ok. So why bother with a 4 pair hedge concept? What sense does that make? I can accomplish the same thing, and tie up less margin by simply going long gbp/jpy. I can see if you are truly delta neutral, and somehow able to collect interest but not the way this is being described. Neo, or someone... can you explain the reasoning? Good Trades, Yukoner

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi, I have the same problem here. Why call this strategy hedging if it's not ? i started a test in demo 2 days ago and i'm -230 pips actually. Unfortunatly i've never had the luck to place a stop at 1 pip . I know i should wait for a good moment to enter, but that's my question : If we have to wait a good moment to enter, and better have gpb/jpy going up... why not just trade ? lol.. go long and win or loose, that's it I'm sure i didn't get all on this !! Sorry if i'm sarcastic, it's just a style , i don't want to offend anyone, especially you , neo, who share a strategy working for you ! I think it worked for you because gpb/jpy is going up for a looong looong time

Hi all, I am paper trading EUR/USD and USD/CHF. It is working well. Opening 1 mini trade every day and collect 0.3$ swap difference. Whenever I see +20 to +25 pips difference between two pair on any day, I close the trade of that day and collect the pips and then open new trade at the same time. cheers, Moneyquest

--- 帖子 #75 ---
This is exactly like trading EUR/CHF, have a look at the chart to see, you get the same swap from this pair as well.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Have you followed my suggestion of entering 1/10th of position and spread out your entry for 10 days?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
If you want to go into the market naked and trade any pair you want to trade, then be my guest. This strategy has proven to me that it works. What you have done is probably see the drawdown in the first couple of days, why not have a little more patience and stick it out for 10 trading days (2 weeks) while entering your position as I suggested then tell me the result? Obviously, now with the market fluctuation, it would be wise to enter when GBP/JPY is at bottom of the range, so try to enter it when is there, but as always, 1/10th of your desired position, and enter it on a daily basis, trying to set limit orders at the low. Once your order is picked up, then enter manually the remainder of the set. I am sure all of those people who say that this strategy does not work, will probably change their stand at the end of 10th day. neo

GUYS: Forex is very brutal and it will eat you alive and probably not even spit any bones out. I have been trading for 3 years now, and what I have found is that unless you can control your emotion, you are not cut out to be a trader. I know I have always had problem in that department, and that is why I adapted to the hedging strategy. It keeps me honest, and not to be swayed by the daily ups and downs of the market. Is it a true 100% hedge? No, it is not. Is it safe? Well, my answer is yes. But don't take my word for it, try it out yourself on a demo. Then come back to this thread and post your result. The only thing that I ask is to have patience. Do not come back here after the first day and say, wow, this don't work. If you are down 230 PIPS after the first day, you should enter again and the next day you will be up 230 PIPS because the market is ranging. I just don't see these comments are at all constructive in anyway unless, you have followed my strategy to a T and still end up losing. Anyways, happy trading. I will be posting some other things that I have been doing lately and share it with all of you. neo

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I totally agree, I'm the one who complain after 3 days trying. sorry for that! Everybody says patience is one of the keys to success and it's certainly true. Bad strategy is to change strategy thank you again for your share neo, even with complaining people, you have this patience ! congrats.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Neo, I do appreciate you taking the time to share your system. I will tell you upfront, that i have not tested it or traded it live. My point was simply this. When you break out all the positions and look at your naked exposure (your first post mentioned potential drawdown of 15%) i believe you will see that your strategy is dependent on being bullish gbp/jpy. Which is why you place a 1 pip stop loss past entry, once it is up 100 pips. The reason you see a drawdown is because your four pair hedge is somewhat weighted to be long usd/jpy as another poster pointed out... yet you are trading out based on gbp/jpy movement. SO the way I see the bottom line, it is this.... simply trade smaller positions in long gbp/jpy that will collect interest and allow for a drawdown of up to 15% in your account. You tie up less margin, and therefore your ROI is better. It is no different than what you are doing now. Good Trades, Yukoner

I am paper trading EUR/USD and USD/CHF. It is working well. This is exactly like trading EUR/CHF, have a look at the chart to see, you get the same swap from this pair as well. I think if you look closer you will find that is not exactly correct. First, the EUR/USD and USD/CHF trade above, is a spread trade looking to capitalize on the swap points. The EUR/CHF trade would be a naked position , albeit perhaps looking to capitalize on the swap points. Separately, the way the Euro moves against the Swissy can be significantly different from it's movement against the Buck. Entering a E/C trade based on E/U &amp; U/C signals or visa versa, can be an expensive mistake.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Neo, I hope that you are aware that your portfolio is not fully balanced. In above combination you actually: Buy 100,000 GBP &amp; Sell 100,000 GBP Sell 100,000 CHF &amp; Buy 120,900 CHF Sell 23,700,000 JPY &amp; Buy 9,800.000 JPY Buy 200,000 USD &amp; Sell 100,000 USD (This is as per today's rate; 7 PM EST) If you want to have properly balanced combination in respect to amount of currencies, you have to trade with different lot sizes. Then you can't make money on interest. There's no guarantee that your portfolio will always get back to positive once it is in minus. Your account can burn out. You simple trade in one direction and market can turn against you. Your portfolio depends mostly on movement of JPY and USD. They are the most unbalanced. I think your portfolio will have similar behavior as BUY 1 lot USDJPY. My two cents. Take care, Jas

--- 帖子 #83 ---
In short, the day when carry trades flat out, this method should be avoid. JPY, CHF carry is the key of the method. Just my glance, correct me if I am wrong. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Samuri, u beated me to it...hahaha thats what i tot...may this method came a little too late?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanx, neo1001 for your system! I'm testing it with success on FXDD. What did you do with first positions of the set when GBP/JPY dropped by 1600 pips? Do you still hold them? What would you do if for example GBP/JPY dropps again for 1000 pips? Or it can hardly happen because of fundamental factors ? Regards

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Find herewith trades taken for EUR/USD and USD/CHF (open trades as well as close trades). I am adding one trade (both pair every day). Collecting swap as well as closing the trade when I see price difference of 20+ on any pair. I open the new trade to replace with closed trade. Neo, I am not trying to be smart or hijack your thread. Just posting my trades based on similar method. Moneyquest

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Well, let translate that: In Short, when the day whole Japanese Economy goes KABOOM! or UK got Taken Over Completed by Communists, then this method should be avoid. Current interest rate differential between Yen and GBP is so huge, any drastic change will bring chaos in the world economy, affecting Japan's export, upsetting Europe, United States, China, and all of the big players in the mix. I don't think carry trade is going any time soon, do you? Obviously when the method is going to go, there were be signs and ways to protect ourselves. That is why we gotta keep our eyes and ears open. Just my 2 cents. neo

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Thank you for your input Jas. However, it does not have the SAME behaviour as buying 1 Lot of USDJPY. I am not going to repeat some of the same information posted before, but just to say that there are always risks involved when you trade FX. But the bottom line is to minimize risk and maximize gain. If you follow my method, you have a good chance of achieving the above goal. neo

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I would be stopped out at 1 PIP profit, then immediately I would be closing my set (chfjpy, usdchf, gbpusd) when they are positive or close to positive. I would wait and time my entry for the next day or the day after it. If I see market sentiment geared to more selling (remember I get in on the trade just few minutes before market close to gain on swap or set limit orders when market is ranging) I would stay out of the market. You can see this by comparing the JPY against all other currencies. If you see that EVERYONE is buying JPY, then my suggestion is to wait and see. And the answer to the last part of your question is yes, because of fundamentals and the basic fact of interest differences, it could hardly happen. neo

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi, I am new to this forum, but I have been trying this strategy for the last three weeks on a demo account with Metatrader; I get the same swap rates for trading minis (10K) that I do for trading standard lots (100K), which works out to about $11 bucks per set. Does anyone know whether this is the case with a live account? It seems too good to be true.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
i demo this method and my account was up about 20% in 2 days.now i already open my 3rd mini set.but my first 2 set GBP/JPY was opened at almost same price.and both set's SL=+1pip now and both set and about 130pips above my SL.so if the price hit my first 2 set's SL,should i close all my set? what happen if interest rate change between these pairs?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Well i think this works good lol The fprices beside the pair is price as of closes on April 18, 07 and the second price is current price i noted...(1.13 am East time) and u would have made good profits + swap... on 1 main lot traded chf/jpy - 98.45 SOLD --99.17 = -720 usd/chf - 1.2046 SOLD -- 1.2048 = -20 gbp/usd - 2.0064 SOLD -- 1.9945 = 1190 gbp/jpy- 237.95 BUY -- 238.41 = 460 im currently just entered the market and trying this .. i will post results after...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Ok - I opened a position on April 19 and my results (granted I haven't followed the system perfectly - not adding the .1 lots, or taking profit) are pretty good. Hopefully folks can use this as a reference. 1 lot Swap: $90.13 GBPJPY: $1162 +139 CHFJPY: - $702 - 84 USDCHF: - $141 - 17 GBPUSD: $630 + 63 Positions: $949 Total: + $1039 since 4/19 at Noon - 4/30 10AM EST

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Your group here are you buying or selling ?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Neo Can you tell me what your risk tolerance has been over the last few months. I realise that you enter the market in 10 steps but what is you full margin used on the 10th day. 70%?? Also i had a look at Alpari's swap rates and they pay both ways on some currencies anyone got any info on that. If its true then you could put a buy and sell on the same currency and earn Swap with no risk. ????

--- 帖子 #96 ---
what are the ways to enter these correlation trades when the correlated pair are out of correlation than enter ? are you just entering at the market open ?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Risk tolerance is about 15% of the account. In which case I would be looking for area to exit trade. It hasn't happen to me yet, because I do time my entry correctly. My Margin for my initial entry is 50% after 10th day. So I would see 200% margin. (i.e. $25,000 in margin and $25,000 in reserve). Then I would start to look for ways to add more position, everytime I am able to lock in my GBP/JPY trade with 1 PIP I would then be willing to enter more position. neo

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Enter when GBP/JPY dips. You can look at past resistance/support level and decide the best time for entry. Use 4Hr or even Daily charts to make your decision. Neo

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Guys, With all due respect... what your doing doesn´t make sense. All it is is basically trading one of two strategies 1) Net Long gbp/jpy expecting it to move up 2) Net Long usd/jpy Your not protected if either one of these markets should tank. Doesn´t matter what interest your getting per day.... and it doesn´t matter how many orders you place below the market. All you do then is scale down. I said it in an earlier post, but let me point it out again... just trade a small position to be long either usd-jpy or usd-gbp. THAT´s IT! You will create the same results, same drawdown, same expectancy. Your fooling yourself if you think having four pairs that aren´t balanced out will essentially hedge a position for you with positive interest. Good Trades, Yukoner

--- 帖子 #100 ---
. Is it? I have demo traded Neo's strategy yesterday with mini lots (10K). I got a net swap of $1.27. So for standard lot it should be 1.27 * 10 = $11.27 which is aproximately the same as Neo put in his first post in this thread.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
neo,have you ever close your set when these 4 pairs currency with positive pips? i am up 28% now for 6 trading days with 3 sets.both G/J and G/U are in positive pips

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Not really. But I have closed my positions when the NET SUM of my trades are positive. 28% is great!!! Depending on your actually margined amount, you can either take some profits or keep on riding the move. neo

--- 帖子 #103 ---
When the market start to DUMP GPBJPY, what is going to happen to CHFJPY and GBPUSD? I am assuming they will both be down, basic supply and demand? SO in essence the hedge part will work, whereas if you were only in GBP/JPY Long you would be wiped out. neo P.S. I thought I went over this...

--- 帖子 #104 ---
i think i agree with people that say, it is better to just put long in gbp/jpy or usd/jpy.... done a few calculation and split the trade to 1micro per trade only, spread it in every few pip interval in usd jpy.... i think it is better to hedge with differ currency pair, ,, we sort the highest to lowest by interest rate and pick it with the least volatile in the edge and the highest volatility in the middle..... (sorry , i forget the thread)

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Well that's what I would expect, but here are my results so far: Currency Pair Lot type Swap (P/L) GBP/JPY STD (100k) 299.15 (258.14) CHF/JPY STD (100k) -53.07 (-556.94) GBP/USD STD (100k) -3.84 (1590) USD/CHF STD (100k) -115.50 (-658) GBP/JPY STD (10k) 174.20 (102.34) CHF/JPY STD (10k) -35.36 (-50.80) GBP/USD STD (10k) -2.24 (147) USD/CHF STD (10k) -73.50 (-83.90) I opened the mini lots above two days after I opened the standard lots. The 1 standard lot set and three minis I have open net about $44 in swap per day. Could it be because of the 400:1 leverage? Or perhaps this is just an error? On another note, can you really have an account with 400:1 leverage with FXDD or either of the two brokers MeteTrader asks you to choose from?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I once read a analysis by a team of great traders. They said if the jpy carry trade were to go down, the next one for carry trades is chf pairs. So...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Neo, What is the best resourcefor the correlation factors between the currencies? PT

--- 帖子 #108 ---
http://www.mataf.net/en/analysis-cor...etVsMarket.htm

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Labrat407, Thanks. I was looking at that but the trend they give is only for 1 day. I was looking for a little longer trend, e.g. 6 months or longer. I also was looking at Oanada's but they only offer few pairs. PT

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Neo, I understand you are shorting and longing all the currencies, but I was wondering that since there is about an 85% positive correlation on the eur/usd and gbp/usd if it might not work out even better to short the eur/usd instead of the gbp/usd. You would get substantial swap on the euro short. I have been hedging a long usd/chf against long euro/usd and gbp/usd and have done pretty well so far. Do you think your hedge is overall less drawdown risk? Thanks, Midas

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Mataf only shows daily correlation now

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Is it Long USD/CHF, Long EUR/USD, Long GBP/USD?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Yes it is long on all of them, but the lots are more heavily weighted on the usd/chf. Example would be 292,000 usd/chf, 115,000 eur/usd and only 82,000 on gbp/usd. I get 400:1 leverage and a good rate that pays about 18.00 a day net interest on this amount of currencies. After 5 months of trading these, they seem very reliable, but the swings can sometimes yield some pretty hefty drawdowns, but they have always come back. Plus, when you are long these 3, you can also keep very small limit orders in play and lock in sure small profits along which add up nicely over time. I am going to demo this 1 long, 3 short system to see how it compares over time. Midas

--- 帖子 #114 ---
What is your plan of attack when they go down and do not come back? How do you prepare in advance for this to occur?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Good question. The best and safest plan involves having an 400:1 account and enough unused margin to weather the worst storms. If you have 15,000 at 400:1 and only risk 10% (1500), you can weather a very bad storm. I went in with 1 account Jan 31 and by mid Feb after the big crash and carry unwinding, my account had lost about 50%, but I still had a lot of margin left and within a few weeks, it had gained all of it back. And now has made considerably more. It can be pretty safe and pretty good return if done right.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
So how many standard lots is this?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
1500 worth of currencies at 400:1 leverage is the numbers I listed before. 292,000 usd/chf, 115,000 eur/usd and 82,000 gbp/usd. Obviously with this system, the more capital you have to invest, the more you can lower your risk level and still make good money. I think Neo talks about buying 4 standard lots with only 3500 at 200:1 leverage but this only leaves about 700 in margin. That sounds too close for me. On the one I'm doing, you have to have a lot more cushion than that.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Neo, Let me go over this again.... When the market starts to dump GBP/JPY it will probably dump USD/JPY at the same time. JPY tends to strengthen and effect most other carry pairs. Regardless of what happens, your raw 4 pair hedge depends on long usd/jpy and your hedge strategy depends on having a stop loss 1 pip past your gbp/jpy entry once it goes 100 pips in your favor. Whether you scale down or not, the exposure is still there as you set it up. Therefore the bottom line of this 4 pair hedge, is that you won´t be protected or hedged should usd/jpy or gbp/jpy really sell off. Do this.... run the exact numbers, with currency conversion and LOOK at exactly what your net exposure on the position is. Sure if you want to compare the gross numbers it can look like a way to put a hedge in, but the bottom line is that you are simply net long a small amount of mainly usd/jpy. You write you would be stopped out if it was simply a small position long usd/jpy OR long gbp/jpy should it sell off... my question is, aren´t you stopped out anyhow with your 1 pip stop loss past the gbp/jpy entry? If I take a drawdown of 15% in your hedge strategy, or a drawdown in the same position, same exposure of long usd/jpy... it makes no difference. I know i am hammering away at this point, but it appears there is a bunch of interest in this 4 hedge strategy from beginners who think they are hedged should a sell off occur. The botton line is you are exposed to unlimited risk without a stop loss of some kind in place. Good Trades, Yukoner

--- 帖子 #119 ---
use jpy as base currency, 1:1 leverage buy usd /jpy if the jpy goes strong, the equity can be withdraw as $$$ profit if the jpy goes weak, the buy position profit goes to equity.... this way, no negative swap &amp; hedged

--- 帖子 #120 ---
i didn't understand....

--- 帖子 #121 ---
what does this mean?? sounds interesting but I don't know what you are trying to say. Please elaborate.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
i still searching a better way to utilise it too: tis may good in 1:1 leverage since the equity it self is 1:1 our money. better if the broker gives interest for our equity &amp; high swap. since it is hedge and based on swap, just keep the position balanced with equity. eg : we have jpy base currency account and use USD in dailly life now the usd/jpy 100 yen = 1$ and we put buy if the usd/jpy goes to 1 yen = 1 usd we loss 99 in position, but the 1 yen left is still worth 1$ requirement : equity = price+ margin

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I´ve made an EA (which i´m testing, cos i´m not a professional codder). I contacted Neo, and if he agrees i´ll (or him) public release it. Anyway it needs improvement and some minor fixes. Thanks Neo for sharing your system with us. alex.pt (aka Carllos)

--- 帖子 #124 ---
What is this EA supposed to do?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
it does almost all that neo described in 1st post.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
lol that sounds interesting but the swap will bee veryy loww you can get the same rentability saving money

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Not only will the swap be low, it will be microscopic. At 1:1 leverage, you'd expect the APR to be LESS than 5%, which means that even though you may have a conversion advantage because you're not using leverage, you would be making WORSE than most US high-yield savings accounts... *shrugs* Why would anyone use this method?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
first of all thanks to Neo1001 and Carllos, for developing and coding this amazing technique. so, when we can expect it to be released? I would love to test it on a demo account. Thanx.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
First version is coded and working. I´m waiting for Neo1001 reply to my email. I can only release it after his aproval. Though it´s not necessary, but since it is his strategy i really would like him to take a look at it first. alex.pt (aka Carllos)

--- 帖子 #130 ---
waiting with fingers X

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Just wondering but... I use InterbankFX and their swap rates are a little lower than FXDD I guess. In total, I would get about $8.00 USD a day from the swap. Now from the spread, it would take me 11 days to recover just by the swap, is that normal? The spreads on my pairs are... GBP/JPY... 8 GBP/USD... 4 USD/CHF... 4 CHF/JPY... 7 So yeah, 11 days if I trusted that everything stayed stable and I earned swap. Anyone else see this problem?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
i have started this hedging strategy today but did not respect the entry time (opened at 1PM instead of 16:55 ) but my idea is just to see where it goes in term of swap as it is a demo account i dont care much... One point i would like to raise is when pair get decorelated in your direction (ie you are gaining from you position ) Wouldn't be intersting to close all position and reopen them just to add some more benefit. Each time your trade goes decorelated you take your benefits and wait for the next swap to open the new position. Eventually, on the next swap time, the pair will be corelated again and you can ride a new wave. edit : my bad, this point has been raised allready edit2 : btw today swap for my broker on this 4 pair combined is 30$ for 1 lot each... (fxlite which is a branch company of FXDD so i suppose the swap should be allmost the same)

--- 帖子 #133 ---
On this system (I'm testing this one since May 03) at FXDD (on IBFX it´s no good because the Swap a little lower) and seens OK, but it´s very high leveraged and requires care. The most important thing whem you entry at GBPJPY and GBPUSD. It rules your balance. O running an EA also and when It takes 6% of profit, it liquidates all orders.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Dear Neo (and all interested readers of this thread) I have reviewed your thread last night, because it kept me interested. Although I have to admit it seems appealing at first sight, I am strongly afraid that you will get into deep trouble if the market turns for a longer period. The reason is: you are only partially hedged. Burger King and others, like Yukoner and Jas did a fairly good job on calculating this. My thanks for this! To recall (with last night's data) and to make others better understanding this, I will break mentally the combined transaction into its parts: * BUY 1 Lot (100K) GBP/JPY means to have 100 K in assets and to receive a dept of JPY 23,892,000 as liability accordingly (this is what you SELL, it equated 100K GBP in form of JPY last night). * SELL1 Lot GBP/USD will annullate your assets of GBP 100K from the former transaction with the new liabilty of GBP 100 K and you will keep a remaining asset of USD 197,440 (this is what you BUY at the same time). Resume: You have, for entering those two positions NO risk at GBP (you own and owe at the same time 100K), but you have 23 something million of JPY you owe and USD 197,440 you own. Those two positions are now similar but will not stay like this as markets move on. But your transactions are leading further on anyway. Now you *SELL 1Lot CHF/JPY means selling CHF 100 K (1 Lot), which is a dept of CHF 100K which buys for your balance JPY 9,883,000 on assets. These assets are netted with your open liabilities of JPY 23,892,000 and you will still have liabilities of JPY14,009,000. *SELL 1 Lot USD/CHF means selling USD 100K, which will give you a new liabilty of USD 100K. It is again partly netted with your assets of USD 197,440 you already own. Now you have a remaining portion of USD 97,440 as an asset still in your balance. From the buying part of this deal you will receive CHF 122,000 that will be netted partly with your liability of CHF 100K of the earlier step. Fact after all: You are ending with a balance of JPY 14,009,000 in liabilities and USD 97,440 and CHF 22.220 in assets after all. These are equal, but just for the moment. A minute later on quotes will have changed and they start becoming different. There you will find your risk. Your "Hedge" will only work as long as the JPY is weakening and the USD and CHF are getting stronger over time compared against the JPY. This is and was the case over a long period and it will remain like this as long as the theme "carry trades" will fuel this trade-off. But for 100% sure, it will not remain like this for all times. Markets and conditions change, as we all know fairly well. So if the general trend changes to the opposite, your trade will run into constant losses. OK. You say that your stop-loss on GBP/JPY protects you. Good enough. But then, why don't you just BUY GBP/JPY and set a trailing stop and hold? The swap rate is even higher and you are consuming much less margin. You get USD 24.30 per Lot presently, not only USD 11.90 per 4 Lot. I think that is much more rewarding. If you would want to build a 100% Hedge, you would have to get rid of all your assets and liabilties on your balance sheet. For achieving this, you would have to structure the transaction accordingly: BUY 1 Lot GBP/JPY SELL 2.4 Lot CHF/JPY SELL 1 Lot GBP/USD SELL 2 Lot USD/CHF THIS and only this will (according to yesterday night's prices) net all of your assets and liabilties to ZERO. Which means: NO CURRENCY RISK. This means accordingly: no harvesting of pips, but you are onto swap-rates anyway, like you said. Hint: If a transaction gains you pips, it is somewhat unbalanced and not completely hedged. It is nice to harvest pips, but you are risking losses at the same time, too and there are usually much easier ways to do that. Coming to swaps: For the fully hedged position you get USD 24.30 and pay 8.40 for the CHF/JPY, 0.60 for the GBP/USD and 17.60 for the USD/CHF. This results in a negative Swap rate of USD -2.30 per day. Ergo: you are constantly loosing money on this fully hedged transaction. Ergo 2: There is NO FREE LUNCH. Gaining swaps is constantly combined with risking pips. Guess what you pay, if you simultaneously buy and sell GBP/JPY? (i.e. no pips risked). My broker wants USD -1.5 from me for that! Unfair, but this is the truth and this is how the markets are structured. Hopefully this thread will now be better informed about the underlying risk of your favoured transaction. Ride it, as long as the major trend is against the Yen. When the trend turns, you will get stopped out more often and later on when the full tide swells into the other direction, you will not be able to harvest any gains with this transaction. Your swap rate gains will be annihilated by pip losses and your equity will vanish in the haze. This is the time when you should forget about this trade and be thankful for what you have got and think of a new and better venture. Regards t. ... still building up again after having burnt EUR 50K own trading money.

very instructional, thanks a lot for working on this explanation

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Neo is a very talented forexer speaking of this system. I did as his instruction for 10 days so far, it looks good. Thank you, Neo. I guess that this partial imbalance is actually magic of your system, cos everyone knows jpy will continue weaking for a long period, and before it ends, we can always do this. My concern that i cannot work it out mathematically, is that if gbp/usd keeps rising (assuming jpy continues weakening), will this system still earning pips? So far my pips won came 50% from gbp/jpy rising, and 50% from gbp/usd dropping. Thanks for Tiku's input too. Nice insights!

Neo1001 not answering my emails. So, eitheir he is not following thread or not receiving them. If i don´t get an answer from him this weekend, i´ll post the EA monday. I shall warn you that i´m not a professional codder, all i did was my best to code with the logic provided by Neo. EA is not autopilot, you have to check it once a day and decide if you will open a new round next day (that is the only not automated thing in it). I did that since many of you may want to consider not opening new rounds (according to Neo there is a Zero round with 1lot and 10 new rounds with 0,1 lots each), or you may want to change the number of lots on each round. All of that is possible if you simple change the external variables provided. I´ll work on an autopilot version this weekend, if i solve the globalvariables problem that were placing wrong trades. The semi-auto version is working fine and is profitable. I guess that untill the GJ uptrend is over it will be very profitable. So, even considering all the warnings beeing given in this forum, it´s my humble opinion that an end of trend will be quiet visible and followed by news from yen changed rates. Maybe i´m mistaken, but that may not happen that soon. My guess is Japan economy will need low rates for a while and though GJ may correct from time to time, this uptrend will last some time more. NOTE: I´m note a professional trader, not a codder and i´m only givin my humble contribution to the forum. Thank you guys. alex.pt (aka Carllos)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEWBIES: * Open 4 charts, GBPJPY; CHFJPY; GBPUSD; USDCHF; * I use D1 (not importante); * Place 2Day EA on all 4 charts; * Go to Navigator (CTRL+N) --&gt; Expert Advisors --&gt; 2Day EA (Choose the option Modify) * When MetaEditor is open go here: extern int hr=15; // change 15 to the hour your want it //to start placing orders; extern int min1=00; extern int min2=59; // After 59 min wont place any more //orders (u can change this value. I recomend // that you don´t use less then 15) extern bool TradeMode = false; //if you want to trade, change // it to true; extern int Round=0; // Round 0 places 1 Lot orders; // Round 1, 2, 3.. places 0,1 Lot orders * After this, click on COMPILE. There should be 0 Erros and 0 Warnings. * Close Metaeditor. Note1: You don´t have to use metaeditor for this. Just click on EA properties on every chart and change the external variables you want. You have to do it on all 4 charts, not just one of them. If you use metaeditor you do it only once and changes take effect on all 4 charts Note2: After min2 expires you can place orders for next day. All you have to do is change Round to next round: 1,2,3.. till 10; (leave TradeMode =true). I´m not a codder so, hope this helps. alex.pt

I'm a little confused about this system. I thought the whole purpose of it is to collect swap. But I keep hearing about stoplosses, breakevens, and trends occurring on JPY-based pairs right now. What do those things have to do with collecting swap? Is this system trying to collect swap or get in with trends?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Carlos, nice work, thanks! Anamy, This system exploits the rollover rate of GBP/Jpy, with 3 other pairs to hedge for safety. but additionally, because gbp/jpy pair is more weighted (more monetary value compared to other pairs), when gbp/jpy rise, u also win pips. and we all know, gbp/jpy has risen for a long time, and will continue for more time.

2Day EA results: I Started trading day 15.5.07 (Round 0 and Round 1 on same day + Another Round each day) -&gt; Initial deposit: $10.000 Today (16h30m FXDD server time): -&gt; Balance: $10.000; Equity: $11.110

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thanks. So would this system still be of any use if the gbp-jpy were falling? I've made my own EA that can handle this system, but I am not sure if I should devote the time to maintaining the demo account, and subsequently a live account with this strategy. Basically, I just want to know HOW safe and HOW versatile it really is.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I've also made an EA, been fine tuning if for a month on it, and so far i find if the initial margin is larger than 160%, it should be able to handle a drawdown of 40%, and most of the time, the loating loss is around 5%. I've been testing gbp/chf/usd and gbp/jpy/usd 3 pair hedging. With the recent appreciation of gbp against the low interest currencies, apart from swap profit, it also made 18+% gain on 3 trading days, which is quite impressive, as you can see from the attachment. Most of the trades are closed in the early few hours of London open, where account profit flucutates between -10 to +3%(that's my target profit), it rarely run less than -10%, so a free margin that can cover -40% should be well enuff. In developing the EA, i've taken into consideration of 1. Margin of each pair 2. Spread of each pair 3. Pip value of each pair 4. Swap value of each pair 5. Daily range of each pair 6. TP in % of account balance (to close the hedge with a % profit that is achievable) I find if you are aiming swap only, then you have to forget about perfect hedge 'coz profit only comes when the correlation is not in balance. Then if you aim for near perfect hedge, than you have to forget about swap profit as the spread, pip value and daily range will sure kill the swap. So i've chosen sth in between. I hope to see some gbp drops and see if this EA is robust enuff to stand it and still make good profit

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Boostrade How do you calculate in the daily pip range ? What formula are you using ?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi, pls. use the attached indicator, I take it from there. Enjoy trading

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Which pairs and time frame !???

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Attached the mq4 file (i guess is from Igor)

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I under stand where and how to get the pip range for a given pair but how are you relating this to your formula for the number of lots to buy,sell ? and relating to pip value for a given pair

--- 帖子 #152 ---
larger daily range decreases lot size lower pip value increases lot size higher swap value increase lot size but of course you need to take a blance out of them with margin level in mind, and have a clear primary goal: if you want to make swap proft and treat it as a carry trade? OR if you want to close the pair in profit as fast as possible and make more profitable trades? I give you an example, in the statementi attached earlier, my primary goal is to maximize swap profit while profit from uptrend of gbpchf. so I formulate the lot size of gbp/chf the same as usd/chf. why? pls. consider this: swap of gbpchf: 16.35 swap of gbpusd: 0.3 swap of usdchf: -9.4 so to ensure swap profit, if you sell 1 lot of usdchf, then you should at least buy 9.4/16.35 lot of gbpchf, in which case you can make +0.3 from gbpusd. so that's the bottomline. if you take spread into account, then it should be a little higher, however, if you take daily range into account, it should be lower 'coz gbpchf moves more than usdchf. Anyway, as i said my primary goal is to maximize swap profit, so i make it the same, another reason for this is i see an upward trend of gbpchf, actually gbp against all low interest currencies, so i'm confident that although there maybe decorrelation, the decorrelation will favour buy gbpchf. Then if you see on the statement, gbpusd is minimized because it also has a large daily range and its pip value is larger than the other 2 pairs. So, if you combine all these factors into consideration, you'll come up with a pretty neat formula for lot size that profits! Enjoy trading

How about someone programming an EA that followed the same "hedge" rules and results, but only traded long gbp/jpy? Good Trades, Yukoner

Forgot to mention that u can see clearly each round trades if you select "comments" on your terminal. The number of Round is the last digit ex comment: 14008 --&gt; Round is 8th (8th Round of 0,1lot) Hope it helps Neo, can u give as a hint if you following this thread? Any use of EA? alex.pt

That is very easy to do, but what´s the purpose of that?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
so today now, my 1.2 lot position has a unrealised 2000 loss. I have 8000 capital now. Neo, I am wondering if I should just wait, or what? because if jpy continue to rise, my capital seems to be eaten out completely. Any suggestion?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I don't know... its almost exactly the same thing everyone is programming to do with four pairs hedged against each other, with stop losses, and take profits. I'm not a programmer. But the danger I see here, is trying to make a system so complicated that you create false security in the complexity of your EA. Which is why i posted the question... Can someone write me an EA that is simply long gbp/jpy with the same stop loss rules?? Some to think about................ Good Trades, Yukoner

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I will do it for you when i come from my weekend at Lisbon. In my opinion, having only one pair it is far better to grid trade it (one side only - Long GBPJPY). I do it in a different account. Grid trading has it´s pros and cons and has nothing to do with the carry trading strategy in this thread

hello carllos i added your ea to 4 chart daily time frame but always the trade is off in 15 to 15:59 and dont open any position. thanks

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Guys: First of all I want to say a word of Thanks to all of you keeping this thread alive. And I want to extend special thanks to Carllos for his contribution in this Hedging methods EA. I will be following this thread from time to time and answering some questions, I just have been involved with different project lately that took almost all of my time. I am planning to start a new thread exploring further on the Hedging strategy. I know people have doubts on this method, but once you put this into test, you will see that it works. Obviously one can argue that if you just go long on GBP/JPY and you can do the same results. But when GBP/JPY moves against you, eh.. lets say 80 PIPS, would you still hold on and stay in the trade? With this method, you would obviously still stay in the trade, since the other pairs will be hedging your losing GBP/JPY pair. There is no perfect formula, perfect trade, or perfect system. But I am confident that my system will work, if you give it enough time. And to all of you that have tried and made money, good job! neo

I tested this strategy with different real scenarios. And find out an optimal lot size, changing it by iteration. I think results are good enough in the medium/long term, based on empiric data. These are the rules: - Initial Balance 1000 - Swap of InterbankFX for mini accounts. - Margin leverage 1/200. - Mini lot size 10k. - Use max margin as it is possible (84%). I used $844 on margin of a total balance of $1000. (Yes 84%). - Used open price for the test. In the 2º scenario the worst price for the strategy was used. Here are the tests: 1º Scenario: The chinese Tsunami (02/25/07 - 03/05/07) OP Currency Date 1 - Date 2 Pips USD/PIP LOTS P/L Ints.

GBPJPY = 1 lot CHFJPY = 2 * GBPJPY lots. GBPUSD = GBPJYP lots. USDCHF = 0.5 * GBPJPY lots. Finally, I made a 4º test, in a year period. But prices are backward. I used prices of 05/25/07 as initial prices, and 05/25/06 as actual (final) prices. 4º scenario: backward (05/25/07 - 05/25/06) OP Currency Date 1 - Date 2 Pips USD/PIP LOTS P/L Ints.

In a wide concept of hedge, this is fully hedge. Hedge isn't strictly a mathematical matter. It also has to give the strategy resistance to the different volatility, concomitant with a positive swap return. Thanks neo1001 for your ideas. Rama

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi, Rama, Thanks for your effort of the testing of different scenarios. I would like to know how you come up with the lot sizes below? I use GBPJPY as the base currency to determine lot size of the others. GBPJPY = 1 lot CHFJPY = 2 * GBPJPY lots. GBPUSD = GBPJYP lots. USDCHF = 0.5 * GBPJPY lots. I think my way of calculating lot sizes may differ from yours 'coz I'll double USDCHF, that is 2*GBPJPY lots. This is because if you see the average daily range (number of pips moves from top to bottom), you'll find that GBPJPY often moves 2 fold or more than USDCHF, and since their pip value are almost the same, 8.2 and 8.3, the dollar value difference at the end will be huge! At least 2 times. So if GBPJPY rises, you sure can make a lot of money, but if it drops, it's also a sure to lose. My calculation of a safer hedge will be GBPJPY 1 Lot CHFJPY 3 Lot GBPUSD 1.5 Lot USDCHF 2 Lot The problem is, is you use these lot sizes, you end up lose in swaps...but you may make profit of 1-3% from time to time. More to go later with more real life test.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi Carllos, your EA is great but is there any diferrent between 2Day EA and 2Day EA V2.0b? Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Boostrade: I agree with your view point. The lot size you has calculated it quite fine to protect your position. I tested in the same spreadsheet of my previous scenarios, and it shows good results on capital P/L. I mean profits and looses in pips. The max drawdown is -6.5% of the balance. Without interests. And as you said, the swap is negative. So you are out of the strategy. This strategy looks for interests gains, protecting your capital. Lot size is perfect hedged in "currency" value terms. But it doesn't pays you interests, as you said. The lot size that I have calculated was determined by iteration: based on a specific initial balance, and leverage, i changed the sizes of the lots manually and looked for the one who reaches the breakeven in the worst scenario, with highest swap. This lot size must fulfill a positive swap, to keep inside the strategy. "More to go later with more real life test." Best regards.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
There is a small bug that some of you might have noticed, concerning the 1 pip take profit. It´s fixed now. Please download the EA attached HERE and replace the other. There is no difference between 2Day_EA.mq4 and 2Day_V2b. The last one is the one i use in my own computer and since i´m allways trying to improve things i don´t want to mess with the EA i post, so i just changed the name for my own private use.

The 2day EA has placed the round 0 (1 lot for all the 4 pairs) orders few days ago. Why it is not placing the orders for other rounds like round 1, 2......(0.1 lots etc)?. Do I have to change the input parameters?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Yes, verify that you have installed Meta Trader 4. Right click over the price panel and click on "symbols". There you can show/hide the pairs you want. If you select a pair and click on "properties" it shows you the swap paid long and short.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
YES Please follow post 141 instructions. You have to change Round to 1 and next day, change it to 2.. etc.. Check EA once a day and decide if you want to start a new round. Check lots on new round, it´s 0,1 by default. You may want to change it. I´ll work on a fully automated EA, at this momment i am a bit busy with 2 other projects and optimizing and forwarding 10 EAs i built. Sorry guys, i´ll come back to 2Day asp. This version will do the job if you check it once a day.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi guys, very good work. It´s the best system I´ve ever read here. What do you think of an EA with following rules: - check if gain is &gt;= 350 if no do nothing and wait 5 minutes than check again if yes buy (at market) 0.1 lot GBPJPY sell (at market) 0.1 lot GBPUSD sell (at market) 0.1 lot USDCHF sell (at market) 0.1 lot CHFJPY The good think on that EA is that you can let him run only when you want him to run, so you can shut your pc down over night because the EA don´t have to watch any close order rules. I don´t know meta code. Is it possible to set the gain as a variable? Regards, Jimbofx7

--- 帖子 #194 ---
It is possible yes. What do you think about this Neo?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Carllos, This is a very good system by the looks of it. Congratulations, Carllos, you have done a good job. Surely there is still room for improvement. I am forward testing at the moment, but it troubles me that the system is lacking stop-loss facilities. One can argue that this is a hedging system, stoploss-placements are not necessary. OK, good enough, but what about an "emergency" stoploss. We saw what happened in February over a period of one month or so. The same thing can happen in a day, or even an hour. Remember 9/11? Should something extreem happen and the Japan economy goes KABOOM!, what protection do we have? At the moment we have nothing....

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi, all my positions were stopped out today.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Jimbo, Did you start out the hedge with a standard and then add minis? Maybe i'm wrong, but with that size account shouldn't you start with a mini per day for 10 days?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
So I open a 0.1 lot set and wait 10 days before I open a new set?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
No. I think you open one mini set per day for 10 days in a row.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Nooooooooo. There is a minimum of brain use here ! Neo said that if you start with 1 lot you can increase by 0.1 lot every 10 days because 1 lot will give you 110$ of margin available. If you start with 0.1, it will take much much longer time to make sufficient margin to buy a new 0.1 lot. If you start with 0.1 lot you would have to buy 0.01 lot after 10 days and not 0.1 (which doubles your position)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Thanks melpheos, but if you look my detailed statement you can see, I bought 1 lot and the next day 0.1 lot and a margin call stopped me out.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I´ll implement that. Maybe a SL: drawdown of x% close all positions.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Reading your statement shows that you opened .8 lots only 7 days after the first open position. Then you opened one more .4 lot position only 3 days after. You were way off your limits in term of margin hence the margin call. In total you had 5.2 lot opened for a 3k account which is too much.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
This is from post #53: "5. The idea is to enter 1/10th of your position and take 10 days to enter them all. So that each day you might enter the market at different price and spread out your risk. Just make sure that every GBP/JPY order when they reach 100PIP of profit you do lock in that 1 PIP so if the market comes back, you can then close the remaining 3 pairs that you entered along with that order. Do this as the market stops your GBP/JPY." Therefore, my understanding is with a $3500 to a $5000 account you would begin with one mini set each day for 10 days in a row. Now you have averaged in for the equiv of one standard set. When you are up $350 in swap you add one mini set.

The hedge Buy gbp/jpy, sell chf/jpy, sell usd/chf, sell gbp/usd gives almost same swap earnings with my broker, as the triangular hedge Buy gbp/jpy, sell usd/jpy, sell gbp/usd I wonder which would be a better choice where stability is concerned.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
You are right. The swap earnings are same in both cases. I am testing both on FXDD demo. The results can only be certain after at least a month of watching. I have tried the first combination last month on demo and it gave me 25% rofit. But what I feel is that the second combination is a perfect hedge

--- 帖子 #208 ---
@Carlos, can you build a 2Day EA-version for that triangular hedge?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Sure, i´m quiet busy at moment. I´ll get to it asp.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi Carlos, Applied my 2 day EA on all 4 charts with buy only to gbp/jpy and sell only to the others. When applied it said Trade= On then gave the time as 23:0 to 23:55. This was the time of the 1 Pm PST candle which lasts from 1-2 Pm on may FXDD trading platform. At 1:55 PM it had not started to place the four orders for the day. Being as I had done the first 8 days manually and was going by Neo's .1 lot a day for 10 day to get the full lot ( spreading out the risk ). So I set the round to 9. Nothing happened as far as placing orders. We do want to use the time listed by the platform when you move the arrow over the candle that appears from 1 PM to 2 PM PST? Not the actual 13:00 to 13:55 that appears as a time stamp if you open the expert in the terminal at the bottom of the platform? So went ahead and placed todays orders manually and set the round to 10 as tomarrow will be the day I get to one lot. Would like to see it work so it will be ready to do the next set of rounds when swap reaches $350. Thank you for any help you could give me in setting this so it works. After you get it working you need to manually set the round each day? Michael

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Please post your settings. Note: "gave the time as 23:0 to 23:55" - Time in EA properties is the Broker Time. So if YOU choose 23:0 to 23:55, it will place orders in that period @ Broker Time. Remember that according to Neo, one should place orders just before broker pay swap. That usualy is before 5pm EST time (see when your broker pays swap). Note2: You place Rounds manualy in EA properties (please read thread carefully). If you want to trade Round 8 tomorow, go to EA properties and choose Round 8, go to hour and place the hour you want to trade tomorow. Better do it same time everyday; go to lots and choose lots you want to trade (Round 1-10, should be 0,1 lots). Really, the only two things to do in EA is: a) Change TradeMode = false; to TradeMode = true; (if you want to trade or not) b) Change Round = x; (everyday place the new round) The EA will take care of the rest.

Hedging strategies have always created alot of controversy. Most who do not understand them think its impossible to come up with a hedging strategy that actuallyworks. I created one about 4 years ago and have used it daily since then. Hedging is a compromise.......you're basically giving up some of your margin, for a little security. However, the key to making it work is in your hedging strategy. Not all hedging strategies work. But once you find one that does, it's an excellent way to build long term daily gains in this market.

Running with 4 lots now on my 10k demo account and down -850 $ due to the latest move... Will see how it goes tomorrow with tuesday swap

--- 帖子 #214 ---
He coach, would be interesting to learn your hedging method. Thanks

Any pointers?

Down 1300$ on test account atm i have still a lot of margin to handle the drawdown which is allready 11%

--- 帖子 #217 ---
melpeos, With your 10K demo did you begin with 2 mini sets and then adding 2 mini sets each day for 10 days? Also, is your leverage 200 to 1 ? What day did you begin? Thanks in advance.

I use your EA since 3 days but he opened only round 0?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Please look at my hedging, I have been in those trades for 4 months, it is now showing a gain of 19% on capital plus all the daily swap, but I was down 46% at one point.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
have anyone back test to see how stable is the 3 pairs hedge gbpjpy/gbpusd/usdjpy ? I think the 4 pairs is kind of bounce away from each other from time to time, im currently working on a 6 pairs and 8 pairs combo, the 8 pairs seem to be the most stable hmmm since there are no reason why u wont have a balance pips when u covers all 8 main currency but I do hope things goes well with the 3 pairs, they seem to make sense...

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Please note the position sizing on the 3 pairs for 10,000$ Long Euro .69 lot (or 6.9 mini lots) Long GBP .49 lot Long CHF 1.73 lot

--- 帖子 #223 ---
You have to change the 0 to 1 on the second day. On the third day you change it to 2. On the fourth day you change it to 3. And so you carry on and on, till the tenth day. You have to do this all manually, the EA does'nt do it automatically. I suppose this feature could be build into the EA.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Me too are waiting for this feature...hope it will out soon! Thanks

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Like I have said before in this thread, you are only partially hedged ... As the USD-JPY pair is poised to dig deeper for the next few days you will see more losses. Rgds t.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
hi Please explain the strategy Long EURCHF and Long GBPUSD (that´s what your pairs represent). Is this based on correlancy of those 2 pairs?

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Neo was working on a 12 pair version. Wonder where did he go!!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I will work on it. It´s not an easy feature though. I tryed it once and couldn´t make it, but i´ll give it a try again. PS- I´m not a codder, i just do funny things with metaeditor when nobody is watching!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Rounds 1,2,3,4,5,6 Closed --&gt; EA still making profit. Till now, Neo strategy surviving.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Down only 300$ now, seems it survives the correction but equity drawdown has been up to 30% but to be precise i enter 2.5 lots at once and not incrementaly. Otherwise, results might have been quite different.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
The strategy of the pairs and the lot sizing is based on: average daily range, price per pips and with the idea that the trade will remain positive no matter what direction it takes, or it won't be negative for very long, under normal circumstances. As mentionned before, my account went down 46% for about 3 weeks around late February but the circumstances were not normal, the GBP went nuts and far away from the others, there was no longer any correlation; but as with anything and following the laws of equilibrium, normal conditions came back and also profitability. For the moment GBP and EUR are + and CHF -, however, I was in the opposite situation when I first open the trades and only the CHF was positive, I was always around 7-15 % positive in the account (I mean by that the overall profit/loss of all trades combined). I have cashed in once only at around 11% profit but I made a lot of swap. Look at the lots it became now a simple rule of 3 (I hope this is the right translation). This is also for you Forex Coach and I give you permission to incorporate that in your course and charge for it LOL. Imagine coming in here and calling yourself Forex Coach with no record......... Have a good weeekend

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Would you mind posting the rules so i can see if i can think of an EA for it? (unless you have one, so we could test!) I´m about to finish the Automated 2Day EA (probably will be released 2day )

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Dear Carlos, The rules are already posted where I have copied my open position window, look at the lot sizes and the direction of each pair, it is that simple. This is for a $10,000 account. There is nothing more to it. You can open these position at any time, no charts to read. Wonder if you can back test this or not ? Good weekend to you

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Carlos, The market has moved a lot, but you see the gains stay relatively stable, this morning as the CHF was in -, I was at 14% gain and right now at 19% again. Also look at the same window on post 220, pip value have changed but overall gains stay the same, it has been that way for months.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
you talked about, "The strategy of the pairs and the lot sizing is based on: average daily range, price per pips and with the idea that the trade will remain positive no matter what direction it takes, or it won't be negative for very long, under normal circumstances" so, the calculation of lotsize need to be in the strategy, and it need to be in the EA. That was what i meant. I can´t backtest. The quality of my backtest is poor and sincerily i don´t trust backtests in metatrader. If i can i use excel (i´m oldfashion). Sometimes i use a simple pen and paper (and coffee) to work around a strategy, even before i open metatrader. I´m an old fashion guy, sorry!

//------------- VERSION 3 ------------------------------// ~Full Automated~ Place EA on all 4 pairs (GJ, GU, CJ, UC) Go to EA Properties and: * Select Year,Month,Day,that you want to start trading. * Select HOUR, MINUTEini, MINUTEend that orders will be sent everyday. (You can change HOUR, MINUTEini, MINUTEend, anyday if you need to) * If you skip a trading day, change (Year,Month,Day) so that Today, the correct Round will be placed * Keep computer running 24/7 (if possible) //---------------------------------------------------------// WARNING: HOUR AND MINUTES MUST BE BROKERS (check Market Watch for correct Broker Time) //---------------------------------------------------------// Wait for all positions to close before starting another set of Rounds. Lots of work on this EA, so i hope you like it! Cheers

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Well, Neo is not here to comment. I really would love to see him comment. You are obbvious following your own lot size strategy. And somehow giving up usdchf seems to make sense. Wonder which of the strategies would sufer bigger losses when GJ retrace 300-500 pips. Food for though..

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Carllos,are you able to create the EA that work same as mirekturon's approach?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Sure! Let him post the rules..

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Mikekturon, please post your strategy if you are going to post your results. It does no good to simply say, "wow, I've made a lot of money, bye." Thank you.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
TiKin, Any chance you can share your system in a logical, easy-to-understand way? And I don't mean posting screenshots of your trades, I mean in the standard way that shares your entry rules, lot sizes, exit rules.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
You´re gonna get one of those replys... ... yeap... i told ya!

I'm sorry, I don't understand what you are saying.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
That will be interesting mikejody. I´ll finally follow a eurchf strategy.. so much people doing it and haven´t seen one live. If you can pelase do the way i do with 2 Day EA (post a day screenshot) Good luck on this one. PS- Just wait for Tikin answer...

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Carllos, can you tell us what the eur/chf strategy is that you are following? What are the rules, etc.?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Guys: Sorry for not being around much. Have been busy with many personal issues. Congrats on your variation of this strategy. I am very happy for you, and for anyone who can take a concept and develop into a more personalized trading style. I for one have been still following my strategy, and so far it has survived and I have been able to cash out on it. Some times trading comes down to a personal choice, when you see the market start to correct and several of your pairs are getting closed out, then it might be a good time to close and cash out some long standing positions and wait for the correction to stop and get back in again, rebuilt your lots. The good thing about it is that once you cash out, you are more flexible and you can afford to be down 100 pips and cost average your entry position during re-entry. I find that gives you a little more room, since you don't have to be "right" immediately, you can afford to give yourself a little more room, like MirekTuron is currently at, with his Equity, his re-entry first lot can be off a little and he won't even care. Guys, keep this thread alive, and good luck to you all. neo

Hi Jones The only person here placing ads was forexcoach. She placed a lot of posts about same subject same day on diferent threads. She got attention yes. The rest of us are following the topic

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Just now EA close capital profit of about 3K of trades opened on 1 June, see attached. My strategy is to close all trades when a certain percentage of capital profit reached, usually from 3-5 percent. Immediately after the close, open trades again when FPI is not 1. My pairs are gbp/chf, gbp/usd, usd/chf or eur/usd (depends on the recent volatility of the pairs) The trades usually go into profit when the price of gbp/chf rises or gbp/usd drops. Last few days have experienced a few difficult periods where gbp/chf dropping while gbp/usd rising, however, the profit made by eur/usd saves the loss and finally turns the trades into a 6% profit. As I pointed out in previous posts, if you are following hedging stratigies, it'd be better to take into account the average daily range of the pairs, reduce the no. of lots of those pairs with large ADR. Typical large ADR pairs are those that have very nice swap like gbp/jpy and gbp/chf. So if you can manage the lots effectively, you should be safe from both rising and falling gbp movements. My observation is: Apart from collecting daily swap, you'll be profiting from either a rise in gbp/jpy or gbp/chf when they are in a rising channel OR from drops in gbp/usd when gbp/jpy or gbp/chf is in the falling channel. The other one or two pairs should play a crucial supporting role to reduce the risks of unbalanced movements and make the hedging ring a truly ATM. My two cents

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Add a "CloseAll" positions. Starting a new set of rounds today. Closed all previous positions. Profit till now: $965.72 (9.66%) Have Fun

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Sounds good but in my experience let the system go for a while to see how far in can go and you can then come up with an average closing %, but 3-5 is not enough and it can surpass 9% easy. Let it run the race.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
How are you using the daily range in you calculation of lots do you have a formula for daily range vers lots ?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Took a look at your blog. Quiet interesting! Will you release HPS EA ?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Carllos,is it possible to make this EA to be able to select currency pairs we want to hedge?Example: Currecy 1:XXX Currency 2: XXX Currecy 3:XXX etc.thus we can select any 4 or 3 pairs that we want and backtest it for best result.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Question: You guys keep saying "interest" and "Swap". Are you talking about making income on the Rollover Rates ? Thanks !!!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
YES.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
doesn't seem to work on my ibfx mini. ok on FXDD demo though.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I guess i know the problem with ibfx.. i´ll work on that l8ter.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I was thinking on a version where that might be possible. The problem will be changging the number of pairs. I´ll have to re-write the code and do some testing first. Anyway.. my guess is that no one will be able to backtest this, since i guess you can only backtest a strategy with one pair and not with diferent pairs. So, you can only forward test it. I might be wrong though.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Boostrade, obviously this is working well for you. I have a question; why are you closing the hedge out? Do you close it and then take profits out of your account? Because it seems that if you close it, and then reopen it, you are right back in the same market with the same equity only you are minus the new trade spreads . Can someone help me understand why we should close hedge trades only to open them right back up again? Thank you.

I do not know that she follows a Eur/Chf strategy.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
mikejody, long EURUSD, long USDCHF: you buy EUR, sell USD, buy USD, sell CHF So, you buy EUR and sell CHF or... EURCHF (consider 1 lot each)

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Yes, I am well aware that a Eur/Usd Usd/Chf hedge is merely a long Eur/Chf, but what I am not sure of is if Forex Coach follows that hedge or some other hedge. There are many ways to hedge, I am not sure she does only that one. That was what I was saying.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi Mikejodi, Tell me.. it´s just curiosity, but did you exchange FR for forexcoach?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Carllos, You can only backtest a strategy with one pair. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Carllos, Here is a multi-hedge EA that may help with coding logic for your EA. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Yes I did. I did not realize FR was MLM and I really do hate MLM, so I am no longer involved in FR. Thank you for asking.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
TimeFreedom, many thanks Many features i didn´t even thought about (like autoratio; correlation..). It will surely help me see new ways into 2Day EA. Anyway, MultiHeadge is diferent from 2Day in many aspects. Major one is Rounds. I´m now working on: * Fix IBFX mini accounts problem * Possibility for traders to choose up to 10 diferent pairs * Possibility for traders to go Long or Short on chosen pairs * Possibility to close all positions if a TargetProfit or a %Loss is hit. * Choose number of Rounds I guess those are the most wanted implemented features. The fact that EA must run in all pairs, is not a bug. It works better that way. I did a test on a solo 2Day EA version and refresh problems closed wrong trades.. Anyway, i shall warn everyone in this thread about something. I´m developing 2Day EA according to basic Neo strategy. And i´ll be faithfull to it. It means, that: - There will be a leading pair (in Neo strategy is GBPJPY). You will have a possibility to choose a different one, but it has to be the one that once it´s closed, all other pairs on the same round will close too. - The leading pair will close on a 1 pip profit or whatever many pips profit you will choose. That is the concept behind closing a round. - You can choose Lots on Round 0 and Lots on Rounds 1-10, but those are the two only options available. - There will be only 10 Rounds avalilable (no more) - I will hardly add any indicators (RSI, Bollinger, ATR.. etc). Basic Neo strategy don´t include indicators and i don´t think EA shall have them. I hope you all understand this. I may work on a diferent headge EA but 2Day EA is beeing developed for those who want to trade Neo´s style. I´m doing this for free and trying to acomplish all things i´ve been asked in private emails, so i hope you understand and enjoy the EA. Cheers PS- Those new features will take a couple of days to implement (i´m not a coder and.. I do have a job )

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Carllos, Here is another EA that may address the features you posed above. TimeFreedom

u can do what i did, download the monthly/weekly data up from 1990 to now and use MS excel to input the data and calculations, everything works wonder and super fast in there after u put in the first calculation =)

--- 帖子 #276 ---
a great job you're doing. Interestingly om my FXDD demo the swap adds up to about break-even!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
That's how it will work if there is no margin call for several days. That's why, one needs to keep large margin available

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Thankx once again man

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Just had a question about the 2day-EA Do we manually close trades? I have an open position making almost 12% so what to do? Tks

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Last version of 2Day EA has a (CLOSEALL = true) option. Make sure you choose the option on every chart EA is running

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thanks for that info so as I understand it we close these trades at our discretion then and not let the EA do that?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I've attached the indicator and explained how I use it in a previous post. Some other friends of the forum posted related indicators too, maybe on page 3 or 4.

Hi Carllos, Thanks for your comment on my blog, have been very busy lately and not have time to update it...but heard a lot of guys love it, the war between the airforce and the army haha;D Hope I could get back to it soon. About EA, no intention to release it now, 'coz of some bad experiences...but I'm willing to share the logics behind it which I think is even better I havent tried your EA but it looks promising too. Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi, Mikejody, In my ea I set a profit target of 3-5%, whenever it's reached it'll close automatically. This is for 3 reasons: 1. secure capital profit 2. reopen trades with more lots hence more swap profit 3. given more swap profit, reopen trades with lots of each pair that reflect the most recent adr and hence to reduce risk of margin call. My experience of developing ea is that it should not only follow your manual strategy but also your psychological or emotional preference. For this hedge ea, i'm happy to see swap profit every morning i get up from bed but it's not enuff. I hope to see more, my target is 10%p.m. more. So for every 3-5%, i secure capital profit, in other words, i'm expecting 2-4 closes every month on capital profit. Now the market conditions changes constantly, recently it has been favouring the gbp/jpy, gbp/chf rise, thus we can all make profit easily, as attached, just now it closed the trade it opened yesterday and secure a nice 4K+ capital profit. However, when it goes against you, like early last week, you'll have floating loss that can go up to 30% or more, and it may last for weeks or even months (though not likely now as the gbp/jpy, gbp/chf still in the upward channel). So my logic is if there's enuff profit to close, close it, secure it, pocket it. Why 3-5? 'coz it is a reasonable profit% to make. just my two cents. ideas and opinions for discussion r most welcomed

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I don't mean equity. I know that it starts very negative due to spreads . My point is that one day's swap adds up to -0.47 according to my FXDD demo.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
humm... take a look at picture (+ $51.3 ). It´s a 1 day swap for Round 0 (1Lot) FXDD

--- 帖子 #287 ---
it's hard to see but here's the active chart since yesterday. the swap fro round 0 is -0.47.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
cgldsmth, Please post the original picture in a zip file so i can open it and see it more clearly. Dont forget to show comments (it´s crucial to see what EA is doing). See if the EA is running on every chart with same options (properties). Anyway. 2Day EA v5, almost done. Only a couple more features to implement. I´ll do some testing before releasing it, since there were some changes in the code and some bugs may show their theets Thanks for your support

--- 帖子 #289 ---
GREAT!!! Not that there is anything wrong with the present EA. But thanks for the good news. Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
here you go.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Please explain excuse my ignorance what pray tell is FP greater than 1 as you mentioned ? Tks

--- 帖子 #292 ---
cgldsmth, That is weird!! Please check image attached. I just can´t figure out why is your swap so low. Are you sure you are using FXDD ? If so, you should send them an email and ask what is going on. Please check this link: http://www.fxdd.com/rolloverrates.html

--- 帖子 #293 ---
He Carlos, PLease try your EA at 1 World Forex and try to have a demo acc with 400:1, we will see the difference you obtain compared with FXDD. I have not used them but eard they pay better interest. http://www.1world-forex.com/ Looking forward to the results

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Tikin Anyone can do it. I´m quiet busy improving 2Day EA and testing it. If anyone is willing to forward test it on different accounts, please do. I´m doing this for the forum. So instead of saying, Carllos do testing for us, it would be a whole lot nice to say: "Here is my forward testing results"

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Yes I agree and will have to learn how to use an EA, if you don't have a link to learn this process, I will try to learn it on my own. So far, I have copied the EA in the Expert Advisor and I know I have to drag it to a chart ..... the rest I am still ignorant. Thanks

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Carlos, I know you are busy but I have a big favor to ask you whenever you have time. I am including the Linear Reagression indicator that have been programmed by an unknown person. However, the line width setting does not hold if I change time frame or if I pass from one profile to another. Do you think you can fix that little problem so that the line acts like all the others. Right now it always come back to the tin line as default. Thank you so much

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I think you've discovered the problem. I run lots of demos, most with FXDD, but that particular demo is direct from Metaquotes website. This presumably explains it. Anyway I'll restart the demo with a 400:1 broker and see what happens. I love the concept of this system and HUGE thanks for your coding efforts Carllos! Looking forward to the IBFX mini version so I can try it out live.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I just wanted to point out that with a 10K account you can risk approx. 3 large lots with a good hedging system (ideally with a 400:1 broker), that compounds quite fast. I have closed my positions yesterday as it reached 33% net gain and reopened new positions this morning and it was loosing but it's now at 1% net gain, hedging is very interesting and I have been live for a while. Your new EA concept sounds very promissing.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I´m really glad to see my work is beeing appreciated and that it´s usefull for some of you. Tikin, i´m not very good with indicators. I´ve built a couple for myself, but that´s it. I will certainly look at your linreg indicator and try to fix it. Be advised that my coding skills are limited. My college degrees include Health, Economics, Management, Chemistry, Psichiatry.. but not codding. Using EAs on metatrader is quiet easy. If you add me to your msn, i´ll explain it to you has u do it. cgldsmth, please post your results when u start the new 400:1 demo account. don´t forget the comments part on picture. It´s crucial to see what EA is doing. Anyway, i shall warn you that it is preferable to do more testing with 2Day EA before going live on real account. Sometimes a bug takes time to show New version is ready.. testing!

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Carllos, Thank you for your offer but I do not have MSN installed as my daughter was using it and it was causing me problems. However, I have found a tutorial and should be on my feet soon, as I need to learn how to run an EA on MT4. Thank you as well for your offer to look into my indicator, keep up the good work. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Beware of bugs!!

--- 帖子 #302 ---
will do Carllos. Planning on at least a month demo before trying live on IBFX. In your new EA v5.1, I see there is a money management routine. If this is to be disabled does the "o" go in the "account management" line or in the "initial money" line"? Tik: can you post your live results?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I just tried out v5.1 on IBFX mini with 0.2 round zero lots and 0.02 further lots. It opened the trades then immediately closed them and kept reopening/closing until I switched off the EA. slightly alarming to say the least.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
hope that was not live test, right ?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
no even if it had been the damage was only about $5. strange though.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
humm... strange indeed! WHAT WERE YOUR SETTINGS ON ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT WHEN THIS HAPPEN? I´ts working fine on fxdd, the bug might be on the ibfx mini or on account management. I´m buying this for now.. http://www.walmart.com/catalog/produ...uct_id=1805502 If you place "0" on "InitialMoney" it wont consider AccountManagement. AccountManagement alow you to automatic closeall positions on a %profit or %loss. I´ll place a true/false to choose AccountManagement on next version with the ibfx bug fixed Cheers

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I put 0.0 on the account management line. If this goes well long-term then we need to identify some good MT4 400:1 brokers that take minis.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
cgldsmth, 2Day EA places 1 lot on Round 0 and 0,1 lot on Rounds 1-10 by default. Did you change the lot value to fit your IBFX mini account?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
yes, I put round 0 at 0.2 and the other rounds at 0.02

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Open NEW demo account (don´t use old one) and test this. I need to fix something in EA. It use account history and sometimes gets buggy when trades are closed. You can use this safely for now (Open NEW account, ok?) Turn account management to false if don´t want to use it.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi, it means fractional product inefficiency. Basically it means if a hamburger sells for 2 USD in the states and 1 Pound in the UK, then we can calculate that 1 UK Pound is equivalent to 2 USD. if 1UK pound is not 2USD, then it's inefficient, and we can make profit out of it. So for a perfectly hedged ring of currency pairs, say buy gbp/jpy, sell usd/jpy, sell gbp/usd, if you multiplier the rates together, you should get 1, for example now the rates are: usd/jpy: 122.94 gbp/usd: 1.9687 gbp/jpy: 242.04 (usd/jpy) * (gbp/usd) * (jpy/gbp) 122.94 * 1.9687 * (1/242.04) = 1 but in reality, it's not always equal to 1, many times it's more or less than it, that's when ineffiency is in place, that means there's space to make profit and that's when some big hedge funds make money from. this is not very relevant to the hedge methods we use here 'coz with spread, we can never make money out of FPI, but I just use it as a criteria to open trades. Enjoy Trading!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I am also having problems with orders openeing and closing on the new 5.1.1

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Version 5.1.1 working fine on ODL demo, going nuts opening/closing trades on IBFX though.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Guys, start new demo accounts please. I´ll work on this problem latter. If an account is fresh new, shouldn´t be a problem. Sorry for this bug. I´ll fix it.

Thanks Carllos, your work is fast and i love your EA very much!!!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Manual results. I has quite a lot of swap to handle a drawdown now. I will continue to buy position every 10 days or so

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I really like this hedging system and I would like to start my demo using it. Being very new to the FOREX market I find it is pretty easy to understand and follow but I still have a question regarding stop loss.... "once you are in profit with your GBP/JPY pair for about 100 PIPS, put your stop/loss at 1 pip profit, only use stop with GBP/JPY pair...." Lets use the example: I bought 1 lot of GBP/JPY for 241.22. In a time price went up to 242.23, so now should I enter a stop loss for 242.24 or 242.22? Can't I just enter Take profit at the time when I'm buying my pair (using above example : set Take profit for 242.23 ) or I'm missing the point. Please help me understand. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #320 ---
beautifully sorted! quote=Carllos;1466909]Anyone here chasing bugs??? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugchasing [/quote]

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Smart2bforex, Based on your entry of 241.22 once price moves up to 242.22 (1.00 or 100 pips) set stop loss to 241.23. This will allow room for a retracement and gives you +1 pips for GBPJPY. Once GBPJPY closes out due to price retracing back to 241.23 close all positions and start over again. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #322 ---
my take on this is to look more at overall profit and decide a level to close all trades if in profit. the system will have times +/-30% and I think it's key to cash in at 10%+, then either withdraw the cash or re-invest with compounding lot sizes. The trade-off is repeated exposure to opening spreads .

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Earlier in the week, I started a new $50K demo account when I came accross this system. The account is now at $58K ... its just unbelievable. There has to be a short coming of this system. What is it's biggest weakness and the probability of that happening.

Hi Carllos, Small rectifications that could be done to EA 5.1.2[1]: 1. Although the Account Management is set to false, the following print appear on the graph page: Initial money $1000 Account TP 20% Account SL 50% 2. In the line below "ROUND NUMBER 1" there is some unreadable overprinting. This is pertaining to the USDCHF and CHF JPY charts only. Thank you for all your efforts. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
What is this for?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thank you guys for answering my Stop Loss question. Even when EA is running the show I like to know how it works My next question.... I would like to start the real account soon. This system makes all the sense to me and looks profitable. My question is: how long should I demo testing ? When it is time to "go real"? I don't want to rush into it but just watching play money to grow makes me anxious. How many of you already started the real account?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I wouldn't go live yet as the EA still has some bugs. For example, v5.1 opened and closed orders several times today losing quite a lot in spread money.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Tikin asked me to change it

--- 帖子 #335 ---
My advise is to test EA before going live. Get used to it.. test all options available on a demo account, untill u feel confortable using it. Anyway, you can do it manually. Strategy is quiet simple to follow.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
seems the 5.1 versions are not quite stable yet, opening and closing lots of orders instantaneously. v4 working well, but just need it on a mini.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
U still have the problem in version 5.1.2 ?? Wow... That is really weird.... Please post your settings I´ll do a version 4, just for mini ibfx and will get back to version 5.1 "Where is that BUG now?" http://repguine.com.sapo.pt/bazucaRG.jpg

Thanks Neo for a great system to trade the upward trend of the GBPJYP. It isn't a perfect hedge but is safer than using correlations to make a hedge.THE LOGIC AND THE SIMPLICITY is a breathe of fresh air.I've being trading it since the 25th April. Pure profit! Some of the members have been talking about doing different pairs and only doing two other currency against the GPBJYP.THERE WAS A GUY ON ANOTHER Thread WHO TRIED IT IN 2006 AND WAS WIPED OUT. In the fall in February / March the GBPJYP fell 1300 pips and that is why you need three sells against it.The longer it goes up the bigger a retracement could be.On JUNE 8 IT RETRACED 400 PIPS MY ACCOUNT WAS ONLY DOWN $400-$600.For those who are looking at the Freedom Rocks correlations STYLE HEDGE they work but as Neo explained when the market gets a problem say goodbye to all profit and capital The reason being at times of economic crisis pe ople don't buy currency they sell and buy gold. If your got three buys two will go down around 400 pips as in Late February 2007 Late February 2006 AND June/July 2006 and the one that is suppose to hedge hardly moves.Freedom Rocks blamed customer for being greedy and using too much margin on their accounts probably partly true but you need to have sell positions. The entering one tenth of your position is fantastic advice and was used by the guy who broke the Bank of England. Another thing I have found interesting is many people tried to tell you that mathematical explanation for the currencies you hold It really a Long JPY US AND A SHORT EURO CHF OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS .Mathematically technical true but these pairs don't have the SAME INTEREST RATES AND IT IS the interest rate attached to the GBPJYP 26% THAT CAUSES THE VOLITILITY IN THE CURRENCY.WHAT MAKES THE MARKET MOVE IS SUPPLY AND Demand mathematics is how we represent the movement.The rapid MOVEMENTof the GBPJYP UPWARD IS WHAT IS GIVES SUCH QUICK PROFITS. Thanks Neo for a great system. ALL WINNERS PLAN FOR THE WORST CASE SCENARIOS! DON'TTHEY GEORGE!

Hey Carloss, first great EA. Im trying to back test v5.1, but having a couple of problems... I set the date to begin back a year and when i run it it only runs for one or 2 days from whatever day I try to start it from... Im trying it on the FXDD demo. money management set to false.... anyone else having this problem or jsut me???

--- 帖子 #341 ---
i could be wrong but at the moment the EA doesn't account for weekends, so it will try and fail to open orders on saturdays.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I understand that, but say i try to back test it from 2006.05.11 to 2007.5.30 it will only show results for 2006.05.11 not any further.....

--- 帖子 #343 ---
You can´t backtest the EA. This has been discussed before. You can only backtest an EA on 1 pair. 2Day EA uses 4 pairs at least. Can´t be backtested.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
thatll teach me to read more carefully. Thanks carllos

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Well, thank you for your kind words... You have hit the nail on the HEAD. The purpose of this type of trade is actually to protect your interest more than to make money. What many novice traders don't understand is that if you can't keep your money, you can't make any money. And I am so glad that someone echoes this sentiment... Keep up the good work y'all, and especially kudos to Carllos for making the EA. neo

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Carlos, Can you post the EA here again, and would it be possible for you to give clear instructions about using it? For instance, will it allow us to enter 1/10th of our position each day for 10 days? Does it place the 1 pip stop loss above the Gbp/Jpy? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
This is kindda of embarasing.. hehehe.. I´ve been reviewing the code of 2Day EA, and there is a really nasty problem in it. First of all it tryied to place orders during weekend, so it just missed 2 rounds . Then, i tryed to understand the problem with the ibfx mini account and i found that the bug was not on the mini account problem, but on the trick EA is using to "index" orders. So, i will just re-write the whole code and the way trades are beeing indexed. i hope that will get all bugs out. Unfortunatly i will need a couple days to do it. Version 2 is the safest version. Though it is not automated. I´m really sorry guys for this problem. I promiss to work on it. Have a great week For a ibfx mini version of 2Day EA v2, please contact me throw email.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I will re-write the EA, for now use version 2. It has a 1 pip stop and u can customize the position at your will.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Thanks Carllos but I will wait until the new version comes out as I'll be going live with it and want to make sure it is correct. Will there also be a way to have the EA take positions automatically once per day for 10 days, and then place the 1 pip stop on all GBP/JPY orders when they are cumulative 1 Pip in profit? Thanks Carllos. P.S. I've not been able to connect with "ForexCoach" yet about training with her, but will update you when we do.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Carllos, thanks for everything!!!

--- 帖子 #351 ---
OK, so.. i rewrote the whole code. So far counting 1031 lines of coding.. hehehe.. I´ve been testing it and is working fine. Not even one bug: * Calendar is working correctly. It identifies weekends and won´t try to place orders. * Not opening or closing trades like a madman (i mean madEA) * IBFX mini fine. This version only uses 4 pairs. Code was a mess with 10 pairs. All major bugs are now gone. I´ll continue to test it, since i don´t want you saying bad things about my mama, when using EA live I have a picture of me after i found the bug.. http://www.vistawallpaper.com/data/m...terminator.jpg PS- I´ll write a pdf teaching how to use it. But it´s quiet simple.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
That's what i think

No problem mate

--- 帖子 #354 ---
HAHAHHA!! Loved that pic Carllos! Go Carllos go! Also wanted to know if you can add the 1/10 positions in everyday for 10 days likem Mikejody was asking for1

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Carllos, thank you! Both an EA and a PDF. Now that's a trader helping traders. Good job! Now, can you have the PDF to us within an hour?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Carllos, can you post the new EA right here? (along with the PDF? )

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I've read your posts to this site. One of your last comments you stated. "I for one have been still following my strategy, and so far it has survived and I have been able to cash out on it." When you say that your system has survived does that mean you didn't make much profit? Or that your system was just ok. When you say survived it made me wonder about your results. Are you still involved with trading your system. Thanks civil

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Thanks for the great post of your 4 pair hedge system. I have been trying it on two different paper accounts. One of them is 100:1, the other is 200:1. I am making money on the 200:1 but one each day for the 100:1 I am loosing at a rate of at least -$0.06. So after day one, -$0.06, after day two -$.12 and after day three -$0.22. Does it only work for 200:1 and 400:1 accounts? Does it work better (more swap $$ in profit) in the 400:1 account? What is the possible downside of this system? ie. If the market moves in a particular way, do I lose the $$ vested? Can the market be in a position where the swap $$ go against me? Any help here would be great. Thanks

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Mikejody, let me do more testing please. I want it to be cleen of bugs. I´m testing it on 2 diferent accounts, a mini with 200:1 (ibfx) and a stardard 100:1 (fxdd). If it´s ok for 2 trading days, i´ll release it. I´ll use it on my live acount, so.. i don´t want to say bad things about the mama of the guy who code de EA Hang in there alex.pt

You got it, Alex!

Hi well I have a 1 thing in my mind ;that buy 2 lots nzd/jpy instead of 1 lot gbp/jpy.... will it good .?I am not counted the exact lot sizes but just want to share the Idea..... Thanks

--- 帖子 #362 ---
You can test it when 2Day v6 is out. Don´t forget to place test results here.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hello guys, I was very excited about such a strategy for gathering swap, so I have made some maths based on history data which doesn't look very nice at first look. I might be wrong in my maths. This is what I did: I have calculated the number of pips won or lost by starting from different years considering the proportions from the first post of this thread. So thinking that you do these trades with 1 lot: buy (+)gbp/jpy(-) sell (-)gpb/usd(+) sell (-)chf/jpy(+) buy (+)usd/chf(-) If you have started this in 1986.01.01, now your balance would be~ -19888 pips 2000.01.01 -&gt;~ -3187 pips 2003.01.01 -&gt;~ -3475 pips And this even if gbp/jpy seems to go up forever... Now it could be that I didn't compute right(I am very surprised of these results), but at a first glance this, in a long term seems like gambling and I'm not so sure the swap would cover the losses in the long run. I don't wanna be combative, in fact I would love someone to prove me wrong and maybe show me where I am was wrong in my calculations(it is not so difficult to import the data for all 4 currencies in an excel spreadsheet and do the maths). The reason I started only from 1986 is that I didn't find any available previously history data for chf/jpy. I just used the open monthly prices for each pair, compute the differences m/m for each, etc.. Excel is great for this.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
You made a mistake. They sell the last pair of usd/chf. But anyhow, it just works as long usdjpy is in an uptrend. Once it reverses the whole thing carries losses. (see my former post). rgds t.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Great, thx a lot. I have corrected it now and the results are way more human .. Now the results are: starting from: 1986.01.01 -&gt;~ -2540 pips 1995.01.01 -&gt;~ 2962 pips 2000.01.01 -&gt;~ 4109 pips 2003.01.01 -&gt;~ 1677 pips So,in did, it seems a good strategy considering that you average the prices and keep adding small trades, as long as jpy is weak. Even the negative first result is ok, for such a long period the swap would have covered the loss many times. And back then in those years the jpy situation was much different. Anyway, now the results look more appealing..

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hello Guys, Keep up the good work. I wanted to keep you posted on my little hedging strategy. I posted before and I closed my last position last June 7 after 6-8 weeks in the market at a 33% return. I re-opened immediatly another hedge trade that is now at 5 % gain with swap payment daily. I have been doing this live for more than a year now, hope this encourages you to keep going.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Tiku, Enclosed please find four (4) charts with vertical lines on 02.22.07. I am using this date because this is a good date to evaluate the performance of this four pair basket due to G/J dropping +1700 pips. As you can see with this basket we only incurred approximately -510 pip or 43% drawdown on a 10K/standard lots or 1K/mini lots account. Bear in mind that 1. we are averaging-in for 10 days therefore we usually get a better price and 2. which is the most important criteria of this strategy is we move G/J SL to BE+1 once we are +100 pips positive. Most likely the drawdown would have been a lot less than 43% due to criteria #1 and #2. GBPJPY: -1,709 CHFJPY: +409 GBPUSD: +489 USDCHF: +301 Total: -510 Pips

Hi well I checked alpari and north finance both of them give a negative swap for total of 4 pair.I mean when you minus the positive swap of Buy gbp/jpy from other pairs it will be even a negative digit...so what is the best broker for going for this 4 pairs ..??with plus 11 $ daily fxdd..??

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I set it up on my work PC (on 24/24) and will hopefully send you forward test

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Carllos, Thank you for your efforts, it seems Vs6 has the same problem as some of the earlier versions that opened and closed, is there anyone else experiencing this on IBFX? It says under the experts tab invalid price order send function Tks Berdj

--- 帖子 #372 ---
???.. It´s been working fine here for 2 days..plus all testing on severall accounts.. alpari, fxdd, ibfx

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Carllos IT wasn't working perhaps because it was on the same account as another EA with different magic numbers. So perhaps magic numbers don't work well with this EA or the other EA. I now have it working on its own

--- 帖子 #374 ---
i can belive how simple this system is and effective...

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Better not mixed with other EAs. 2Day uses magic numbers and commentaries to "locate" the trades and shut them down when it´s needed. So, any other EA using magic numbers at same time will get into trouble. Anyone else having problems?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Seems ok on my side, it placed 1 order on the different pairs and stayed there so it's ok so far. Need to wait tonight to see if it places order with the correct size but there is no reason why it would not do so ^^

--- 帖子 #378 ---
This has been discussed a lot on forums.. Some people say there are pros and cons. Some say, that if you stay on a favor swap position for too long the broker will close your account. Some say, that the investment on 2 accounts doesn´t give you enough returns. I really don´t know. But i´d love to hear from someone who does it on real accounts.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Sorry, that broker has spammed the hell out of us and is not accepted here. Moderator

damn.. you´re fast!! How can you be so fast jones?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
LOL BTW, that is a nice EA you coded... Hard to believe you are not a programmer

--- 帖子 #382 ---
have setup EA on demo account. Question I have is will it place Orders automatically. My set up did not do this for round one today

--- 帖子 #383 ---
It has to.. please chek pdf file, see all inputs in EA properties and MAKE SURE you have the same settings (EA inputs) in ALL the pairs. Time to enter trades is brokers time. It will place orders on autopilot. Please review it carefully.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Thanks jones I think that a real programmer will laugh when he sees the code. Most of things i did in a tradtional way instead of using cicles (for.. return . I did it this simple so i could deal easily with bugs. I´ts not pretty but it works I´m really not a codder. Cheers

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I was trying to setup EA on my demo account yesterday and as embarrassed as I feel I just don't know how to do it. I tried to follow the instructions from post #141 but there are not clear enough for me. I hope there is more people like me so could some kind expert create "EA step by step setup for dummies" This could be very much appreciated. My next question is about profit. I'm using FXDD and I understand the difference between account balance and account equity. My question is :what is account equity reflects...just PIPS profit or PIPS profit and swaps ,if I want to withdraw some funds ( if there is enough equity to cover the margin ) do I have to close some position or can I just windrow the earned swap without closing anything . Thanks for all the help.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
EA placed ordered yesterday without trouble. With the GBPYEN going up, the GBPYEN orders allready has a 1 pip profit locked in automatically. Seems OK so far

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I will try to do a step by step, how to .pdf file. I´ll have to do a lot of screenshots so it will take a few days. Didn´t though that would be necessary, but i guess there are a lot of new traders using mt4 that don´t know how to operate an EA. Maybe someone else can responde to your account equity questions. I may not be the best person

I have a question about the strategy itself. Now that the Swiss bank has become hawkish and will be raising rates. How will this effect the strategy?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Don´t worry. Do the following: - turn EA off. - replace the 2Day v6 for this one (2Day v6b) - Check inputs (order lots, trading time, account management, etc..) so they will be the same has the version you are replacing No need to start new account, just replace with same settings. I found a minor bug on the 1 pip take profit code. Its corrected now. If settings are the same everything will be ok, but Check Them!! alex.pt

Greetings, I have a question for Neo, but since he no longer replies here (or to private messages) possibly somebody who understands this hedge could answer: Why do we add to our position when we are 10% ahead? Aren't we in essence always "buying high" when our hedge grows by 10% or not? Wouldn't it make more sense to add to the position when the equity is 10% behind instead? Just trying to understand. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
10% of the round 0 lot size is added because the swap interest covers that amount. It doesn't matter if the equity is positive or negative, it's the swap which allows what is effectively a compounding scenario. does this make sense?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
When I read the first post of this thread 2 months back, I was not impressed, the system looked complicated and I did't bother to read often. But, looking at this now, I can see how much it has been developed, grown this long and I am going to give it a try now. Thanks neo and all for this great system.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
OK yes this makes perfect sense. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Thanks to Mikejody i have an important question for Neo concerning EA strategy. Unfortunatly neo is not receiving pms right now, so i hope he came arround to answer my question.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
This version is using an agressive 2 lots, 0,2 lots.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
The interest rate differential is still very high compared to others. But I guess we won't know until the rates are actually raised.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Ok, remember from the perspective of the 4 pairs, when you add position, you are actually buying high on one pair and Cost Averaging on the other three, or vice versa. So when you are accumulating pips with GBP/JPY, you are actually entering the GBP/USD at a better price than you originally entered, thus giving you an overall better price. Same principle applies to the CHF/JPY, and USD/CHF. As long as you are entering your trades and spreading your risk with averaged position, your account will be able to handle more movements and thus giving you more swap per day. I hope this answers your question.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Carllos Ask away!!! I am here now and to stay!!! Sorry guys been very busy lately, Didnt mean to abandon you all, but I am back now. So please shoot away with your questions, comments, or just to shoot the breeze... neo

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Thank you and I am very grateful for the people in the forum who participated in this thread. Its the people that make this system better, and if anyone should get props for making this into what it is today, I think Carllos is gotta be the MAN. neo

--- 帖子 #406 ---
neo, thanks for returning. here are a couple of questions for you. did you end up making the change to adjusting lotsize for the different pairs as was suggested by some people? You have talked a few times about spreading the positions to mitagate against price changes. Do you have a minimum gap between trades? If so do you just apply this to to the GBPJPY, all the pairs, or just as long as one of the pairs is sufficiently different to a previous trade? Do you have any other rules in this area worth considering?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
To answer your question, I did not work out a lotsize adjustment because of the simple fact that doing so will negate your earnings on the daily swap. As you might already know this, the fact that this hedging is not 100% perfect, but it will absorb majority of the moves during unwinding of GBP/JPY trades. So I have decided to leave it as is. I don't know if you guys entered the market at 230 (GBP/JPY) when I first started to post this strategy, but many people would not have stayed in GBP/JPY long all this time if it werent for the hedging part. Now I am sure majority of you who started to test this strat back then are sitting on a very sizeable equity, and that goes to show even without the perfect Lot sizes, we can still stand to profit. As far as the entry is concerned. I have always thought to enter your positions in a 10 day series. Obviously my advice is to enter the market when your entry will be at the greatest difference to your previous entry. Try to spread your entry as far apart as possible in terms of prices. Since this trade is directly related to GBP/JPY, we will use that currency pair as the basis of our entry. But even if you were to enter the market blindly, using Carllos EA, you are still going to be fine in my opinion. The only thing that worries me is when people over leverage and over trade. That is the one single factor that would knock your account out. Always start low and add in your position slowly. You are in this for the long haul. neo

--- 帖子 #408 ---
A Big thanks to all participating in this thread, and a special thanks to Neo for starting it and Carllos for your enthusiastic input. Neo i have a question? The GBP/JPY has retreated over the last 2 days. We placed 2 new sets which never reached the 100 pips to place the 1 pip stop and they have retraced beyond our entry. How do you handel this situation ? Regards Mike

Hi Neo i´m glad to have you here. I´ve been doing my best to get an EA with your strategy in it, but this thread needs you around. Since you are here, i´d like to ask you to please post 2Day EA 6c.mq4 on first post, so everyone knows where is last version. That would be cool. You said EA enter the market blindly, that is not 100% correct. EA enter market when user choose. I build it so anyne can choose Day and Time for entering market. If anyone wants to wait for a retracement to enter, that is possible. It´s a very flexible EA. Lots, Rounds, Day, Time, position, to enter market is all configurable. It´s almost a suiss knife for carry trade (only 4 pairs allowed now). Other thing i wanted to ask you. I was looking at your post (after a PM from mikejodi) http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...1&amp;postcount=53 There is something there that it´s not very clear. The 10% profit to open a new trade is clear, but youalso say.. open new "1/10th of your position and take 10 days to enter them all". So.. now i´m just not sure what to do when we have profits in the same day, after opening a position. Basicly, i set a new position every 10 days and position size is configurable. but EA isn´t build to enter a new position after some profit. My point is, should we forget the 10 days and enter market for new positions after some profit, or keep the 10 days for spreding risk? I guess there is something here that need to be cleared. Thank you for your help neo

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Please close MT4 and reopen it. Use only 2Day EA 6c and no other EAs on charts. See what happen. This is a strange event, that happened before, but my guess is something to do with IBFX itself. I´ll take a look anyway. I have a feedback of several people using it on IBFX mini working fine, including myself. Thankx Note: i use D1

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Tnks for the reply. I'll follow your instructions.

Would this system be helped if the base currency of the account was in yen as suggested by Gwan in the thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=28080 ?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Just keep on entering the trades, as far as your new entry is concerned, your hedged 3 pairs should be absorbing most of the movement, just be patient and let the EA do its job. neo

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Neo, two questions for you. In your live trading, are you using the EA now, or do you add positions manually? So far, upto today, what was your maximum drawdown? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Neo and Carllos, I am wondering what the reasoning is for 10 days as max, if I wanted 25 days? Just wondering if the GBP/JPY takes a tumble and it lasts 30 days and I want to average all the way in why not make it more flexible? Just curious. Tks Neo and Carllos

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Carllos Version 6c doesn't seem to be opening any trades no alerts on the experts journal so it looks like it fell asleep. Using IBFX

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi Neo Thank you for taking the time to share your strategy and answer questions. Thank you to the other members who answer questions and take time to build EAs for the community. There are many of us here who appreciate your efforts. I have been manually testing this on a demo account for a couple weeks. Of course it looks great while GBP/JPY keeps going up but now that it has retraced a bit I have some questions. I had 2 trades that never reached far enough to have a +1 pip stop loss order placed. These trades seemed to only have GBP/JPY dip while the others did not pick up the slack, leaving that particular set a net negative. 1) When a trade never reaches 100 pips on GBP/JPY and it starts going down, how long would you hold on to it if it continues to fall? When, if at all, would you take action? In the following quote, are you saying not to exit any trades going net negative at any time? 2) When a GBP/JPY trade gets stopped out at +1 pip, how long would you hold on to the other 3 trades in the set? Would you exit immediately? Would you wait to exit with more profit or until they become positive? Would you hold them for multiple days? 3) During the time when you are building up your trade and entering a set every day (1/10th of your position spread over 10 days), suppose a GBP/JPY trade is stopped out at +1 pip and suppose you exit the corresponding 3 trades (exit the full set). Would you attempt to make up for the stopped out trade by entering 2 trades the next time? Or would you simply keep adding only 1 trade per day and make up that trade later? 4) When you are entering your 1/10th position spread over 10 days, if you see a few days where GBP/JPY is dropping over 200 pips per day, would you wait until it settled out before entering a set, or enter anyway? I am curious as to when it might not be a good time to enter a set. I am really excited about this method and it is my desire to learn how to use it correctly. Its my responsibility to carry it out, of course, but I want to make sure I understand it well enough first. Adam

--- 帖子 #419 ---
There is something wrong with your settings. EA is placing trades correctly on all my testing accounts including ibfx mini. Make sure you have the SAME settings on all pairs. Please post your settings.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Does anyone here still need the pdf for newbies? The one about "How to use 2Day EA" ? If i get enough answers i´ll do it, otherwise there is already a pdf file avalilable. Neo, dont forget to include the pdf file and last version on first post. Thkx alex.pt

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Tip: It sounds like people are getting the settings wrong between each of the EAs. If one just saves the setting and then reloads them for each chart, they will be assured of having them all the same.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Glad it is working for you now I have some hope! Here is my set file its OOTB Tks

--- 帖子 #423 ---
the EA closed 4 trades but unfortunately the 4 trade was not in profit If i remember well something like -68,-73,+80,-+n/s adding the swap was something like +7$ Keeping the trade open would have keep the hedge running

--- 帖子 #424 ---
What is the balance on your ibfx mini account ? Please see this link. http://www.metaquotes.net/forum/1648/ This seems to be some kind of a bug from metatrader and has nothing to do with 2Day EA. Please use last version and check if your account balance is not above ibfx minimum account balance allowed. If it still, please open a new demo account. try it.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Seems it works after I turned money management off any reason why?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hello Carllos, Thanks to neo and yourself for bringing this thread up to this point.. Anyway ive been trying to test it for the past few days, nothing seems to be happening, as in the trade is not taking place... Parameters seems to be alright, not sure on what im not doing right.. Im putting in the trade time according to market watch and the starting trading days the night after.. Possible of having that manual up carllos? would help everyone in the long run..

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Please post your settings. I got some pms with a situation like that, and it turned out to be that EA settings had a lot size too small for some brokers. Let me give you an example: broker A only allow minimum 0.1 lot and setting uses 0.01 lot, or broker B only allow minimum 0.01 lot if account is mini ($1000) and account created is normal (account balance 100k. Those are situations where orders would not open. Usualy when orders don´t go throw is due to lot size vs account balance. Dont forget to place same setting on all the pairs.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Ok, everyone should watch this. EA placed Round 0,1,2. Regular lots: 1, 0.1,0.1. GBPJPY retracement (expected since RSI was topping out) turn my 10k account int a $3500 account. All trades were closed by broker (margin call).

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Seems to make some sense. Now i have to work around an MT4 bug, Great!! I think there is a way to solve it. Anyway, it´s not 2Day EA bug. I have money management turned ON as you can see and there is nothing worng with it. Works fine. I´ll work on it. Got to get my MIB special bug terminator gun

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I just watched my earlier statement and the EA closed automaticaly not only 4*.1 position in loss but also 4*1 position in loss as well (not covered by the swap ) I think the strategy is good but one should not sell the GBPYEN with 1pip profit...

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I want to thank Neo for sharing this system. I think everyone here is doing a great job, but for the life of me i cannot see the need for an EA with such a simple to follow method. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. To me manual trading is always far better than an EA. EA's always seem to be nothing but a problem. Just my 2 cents. Thanks again Neo!

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Well said drayco, some strategies sure need EA. This is a simple and straightforward method, I like to trade this manually, that's why I asked neo if he is using the EA in live trading. Carllos did a great job here, but manual entries, exits, management seems easier to me, unless anyone can prove otherwise.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
The only problem is when your away from your computer and things start moving and you can´t do a thing. Not everyone has a computer arround 24h/day.. If it´s not that, no one needs an EA.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I agree Carllos, EA avoids emotional side of trading as well. Keep up your good job, really appreciated.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
well my forward testing so far has not shown a lot of resilience against a GBYJPY downturn.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Carllos I have been looking at this idea tell me what you think. I read about this hedge which yields positive spread, only need gbp/usd and usd/chf and since when one goes up the other goes down it sounds like a nice simple strategy. Also if you would program a take profit at 20pips or adjustable either way it would be then automatic as it got in and out of correlation . Then I would place 30min waiting period to open new orders . The example should be buy .1 gbp/usd and .14 usd/chf I am now doing it manually but it is difficult since they move quickly sometimes. Is this doable? Berdj

--- 帖子 #437 ---
It is, but it would have to be a different EA. Lets hear what Neo has to say. Anyway, i can place more options on 2Day EA that would fulfill the needs of this strategy, but it might be even more confusing then what it is now for newbies. Lets hear from neo.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I know that this is an amazing strategy since the correlation goes in and out all the time and at the right time when there is profit we would capitalize on it. If putting it with the 2 day is too complicated then we should start a new thread. Doesn't need to be complicated but I have some ideas how this would be amazing. Thanks for your help on this Berdj

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Ok, I am using IBFX for demo and currently the testing is created on 100K a account. So how do i fix this? Change the InitialMoney to 100k and lot size? I am also running another EA on a different chart, will this affect the hedging system? Magic number is being used in my earlier EA. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
couple of ideas for a modified EA: 1. put a 100 pip trailing stop on GBPJPY that kicks in after 100 in profit. 2. Enter new rounds when GBPJPY is rising out of a lower BB (or crosses the middle line), say on H4 chart. I've attached an old EA which has this BB function in the code. the EA hedges guppy with CHFJPY. Maybe you can find something useful in it Carllos?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Change the initial money to your current accountbalance. That´s whats wrong with your orders.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
This is merely a GBP/CHF trade, not a hedge.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
i'm just wondering why noone care about what i'm saying ??? i said that the EA closed the 2 groups of 4 orders and it was loosing trade when grouped (even when including the swap ) Closing the GBPYEN with 1 pip profit and the other attached 3 orders does no garantee at all that the whole batch will be in profit !!!

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Carllos, As you know, Neo does not respond at all to PMs and does not frequent this forum any longer. If you're waiting for him to respond, you'll probably wait a long time .

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I care, Melpheos

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Thank you for the sugestion. I said on post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=274 that i wouldn´t be considering indicators for this strategy. Anyway, the idea seems to be interesting and worth to take a look at. Lets hear what neo has to say. This is his thread and his strategy, i´m just the guy who plays with metaeditor. .. humm wonder if i should skip to PS3

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I care man Did you see that i watched my 10k account drawn to 3K? But that was a very good lesson. Look at RSI!! Entering Long orders when RSI is above 75 is a call for disaster.. So, neo was right when he stated that we´d better wait for a retracement to enter and if possible on a wednesday

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Im doing something like this right now. Ive written a EA that has a trailing stop on those hedge pairs.. Then wait for an hour then place a new order. it would be interesting to come up with some sort of average as to how long it takes to correlate again.. Gordon

Hello all, I am new to forex and have been demo Testing till now.will like to go to live trade soon. Been impressed by this stratergy and would like to demo test it. If any one needs volunteers for demo testing this ,i am very keen to help. Carlos, give me a shout if u need any help with demo testing. But since i am new ,i will also need some guidence as to what to do. I have started this stratergy on a new demo account on FXDD.com yesterday.Placed trades manually on a 50K demo account. Trades were : 1 LOT BUY (+)GBP/JPY(-) 1 LOT SELL (-)CHF/JPY(+) 1 LOT SELL (-)GBP/USD(+) 1 LOT SELL (-)USD/CHF(+) I have looked at most places in the account window but couldnt find where iot said how much it swaps contributed to total account balance. I can see the total loss/profit i am in due to change in pips in the 4 pairs but unable to work out how much of the profit was contributed by the swaps. Anyone using this broker(fxdd.com), can u pls direct me to find out how much of a positive balance i am in due to the swap. I know we can work it out manually..it is ok for 1 round of lots but when it starts to get 20 rounds it may be difficult to keep track of each lot .thats the reason for my asking. Then again,i will keep u guys updated on my results of testing and anyone who needs a volunteer ,pls let me know.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
A quick question to clarify! Having bought i set of standard lot on 4 pairs, the next step is: 1. wait 10 days for the swap on daily basis to accumulate to 330 dollars 2. on 11th day start buying 0.1 per day for another 10 days 3. on 21st day ,we start buying 0.1 lots per day again for another 10 days.. Is that correct? Thanks in advance. Regards, Sri

--- 帖子 #452 ---
1) you will accumulate about $330.00 in swap during 1 month not 10 days 2) you should spread buying your 1st set of standard lots of 4 pairs during first 10 days 3) you start baying 0.1 lots of 4 pairs if you will gain a profit of $350.00 in your account I hope I have this right

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Thanks for ur reply.Thought i was missing something...u are right about the swap gets to 330 $ in 1 month and not 10 days...so 2nd round buying starts in another month,i assume. now just wait and watch as i accumulate swap.Well, that could be a bit boring but who cares as long as its making money. My account is +600 after 48 hours.May be mostly becoz of the bounce of GBPJPY for 200 pips in last 48 hours. Will keep u guys updated on my results

The only problem is that buying 1 lot of GBP/JPY and selling 1 lot of CHF/JPY isn't a true hedge because the volatility is different. A true hedge might be something like 1.5:1 for example.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
For those of you that emailed me, and downloaded the app, Email me again. There was a problem with the file on the FTP server.. Ive fixed it.. Re download it. Gordon

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hi, Anymore new update on this EA...cause i am thinking to go live soon. There is one issue i want to ask: After the 1 lot entry for 4 pairs, do we wait for the next month to start the 0.1 entry for the new entry or the next day? Thanks

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hi There is no new update at momment. All have been implemented and is working fine. I´ll work on a new pdf file for newbies but at momment i´m quiet busy. You can go live with it at your own risk. If you use MM, make sure InitialMoney is the same as your AccountBallance or you will have a problem with server. You can turn MM off if you want it´s optional. My most precious advise for those using neo strategy is "Wait for a retracement before getting in". I personaly would wait for RSI (Daily) to go under 50 to get in, else certainly under 70. if you use EA it will place all orders for you, if you do it manualy you enter 1 lot first day and 0,1 lot second day... till day eleven. On a mini account that would be 0.1 lot first day.. 0.01lot from day 2 to day 11. Take care and have fun. alex.pt

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Thanks for the reply.... Last question, usually when do u close all trades? Thanks

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Trades close when they are stoped. After all trades are stoped start new round. I´ll be away in spain for some hollidays. Hope you guys stay well.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hi Carllos, Thanks a lot for your EA. Maybe c an you modify your EA to 3 pairs ( for example: (+) GBPJPY ; (-) GBPUSD; (-)USDJPY ) instead of 4 pairs ? Best Regards, Viatoris

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Sorry, on hollidays. No need to modify. Go to EA properties and configure it. You can change pairs and if you want to go long or short. It´s all there.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I am still a little uncertain here with this entry for Time2Go. Alpari has a time of +3.5 GMT. I have placed 3.5 for Hour: "extern int HOUR=3.5;". Is that correct or should I then add the Rollover time to that, or does the EA do that for me? Thanks. Frank

--- 帖子 #466 ---
OK, Here it is , and totally re-written. I got Zero feedback on the last release, so here is what I came up with. I consider it a beta version. Dont base your trades on my softwares results.. You know the deal, trade at your own risk, blah blah blah. I contains 3 years historical data, it 10 min. It will test up to 6 pairs right now. www.hammstring.com/hedge/setup.exe Install it.. When you run the app, go to "File", then Login. To log into my server, use Name="forex" pass="forex" I'll be fixing some bugs.. the software will automaticly update itself when you run it. Gordon

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Gordan, thanks alot for your work i'll have a look and play with it over the weekend. regards mike

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I will be adding Interest calculation..Next couple of days. Only reason I havent yet is cuz Im still trying to figure out how my broker figures it.. Gordon

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Ok, I just added Interest calculation.. Seems to work fine.. but again..its a beta.. Gordon

--- 帖子 #470 ---
some one is probably gonna roast me for askin a stupid question, but Ive loaded the EA, got smiley faces, but it says trade: OFF on all 4 charts. How can I turn it to ON?

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Or does it only show ON during the time set to place orders??

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Gordon Great job on your calculator, works well I am to new at this to give you any real life feed back but thanks for sharing your program

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi Gordon, I am new to this system. Your backtester software is cool! However when I try to run it, I got this error message. Any suggestion? Thanks. Cheers,

May i know which reliable broker have leverage of 400:1? currently using oanda which only has up to 50:1 leverage..

--- 帖子 #475 ---
IBFX has 400.1; North Finanace has 500.1

--- 帖子 #476 ---
i'm trying to long gbp/jpy n short eur/jpy 1 lot each wit levrage 200:1 account start wit 300USD. any comment? is tis hedging?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
no it is not, both of these currencies usually move in tandem together. up or down the same so you would win one, Lose One.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
i still duno how the hedge can make u earn. i had long for gbp/jpy short for gbp/usd, usd/chf, chf/jpy. i'm now like - 300pip and it hit my margin call...

--- 帖子 #479 ---
right settings, i am down 500 pips. unfortunately, caught us as gbp/jpy is unwinding, recommend waiting until this is finished and gbp/jpy is going up again. probably in 239.50-00 area. hope this helps

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Shld i bring the exposure of the currency to zero? regarding lot size, izzit 1 lots for all pairs? but the units needed will be different rite? wat shld i do?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
first, i would wait until gbp/jpy finishes unwind/retrace. if you look at day chart, it shud be pretty obvious. then start hedge ea. on standard account, use 1 lot for round 0 and .1 lot for all other rounds of each pair. on mini, use .1 lot for round 0 and .01 lot for all other rounds of each pair. all other settings same as before. Rod

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I'm using oanda . so mean 10k unit on 4 pairs? but the pip per value will be diff. is tt okie?

--- 帖子 #483 ---
pip value difference is okay. round zero is 10k buy on gbp/jpy and 1o k sells on the other three. All of the other rounds would be set up for 1k buy on gbp/jpy and 1k sells on the other three.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
pip value is ok. done.. but -500pip is alot. tot tis system suppose to hedge. currency offset each other. hw come still will haf -500pip loss... means i cant open a account using tis system of 1k deposit. if the pip kp building up up to lets say -2000 to -5000 pips in long run, wun our account dry up b4 we could actually gain the swap?

--- 帖子 #485 ---
normally it works great. 2 things have happened. unwinding of gbp/jpy carry trades (which is what generates the positive swap normally) and the failure of the other pairs to match its momentum. it will work once the gbp/jpy slows its downward march and will really work well once the gbp/jpy goes back to the longterm trend which is up.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
so, tis system muz allow to withstand hw many pips drawndwn? will it be like nw the situation for me, i dun even haf enough margin to open .1lot?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
i don't know how many pips average drawdown is, i did not make the ea. i just use it and this is the first time there has been such a drop in the gbp/jpy. dont know what else to say. maybe the long time users or developers will be on this thread shortly and can help you more than i can

--- 帖子 #488 ---
haha... means we r unlucky... i juz try tis system last wk n BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!! everything is falling like mad... i tot tis will be a profitable hedging at 1st when i c some swap earning.. den suddenly there's like few hundred pip loss n i was like, ( stare in blank to comp for few min) wondering izzit my comp lagging...

--- 帖子 #489 ---
it happens. as of now, i am only down 340 pips now, and have $76 in swap added to my account this week. i have it on mini account. good luck

--- 帖子 #490 ---
which platform u using? wats the leverage? u start with hw much initial balance? u use tis system for hw long?

--- 帖子 #491 ---
fxdd, 200 to 1, used system for 2 months, small 4 figure initial balance. just trying it to see if i can pick up 2-300 in swap each month.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
so is ur account balance increasing despite the unwinding? btw wats unwinding mean?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
account at moment is down due to unwinding. unwinding has long full explanation, short version is that low interest currencies that pay good swap can unwind (fall drastically, 1000-1500 pips) at times after large long increases ( see gbp/jpy weekly charts, 3 severe drops shown) then the carry trades starts to wind back up and go higher.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
so when is the time the unwinding will stop?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
hard to tell and you would get many different opinions. next support i see is 241.50 and if broken, 239.50 area. depends on financial news as well. if us economic numbers start looking better, investors won't need to cash in profits from carry trades to cover other debts, obligations and carry trades will resume. hard to explain in short emails. you need to google carry trades or go to forexfactory.com threads on gbp/jpy and other carry trade currencies. thats about all the help i can give you

US dollar recovers ground in midsession Asia on carry trade unwinding SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) - The US dollar was recovering some ground against the yen and euro in Asian trading midday Friday following the Wall Street-led global equity market sell-off arising from heightened fears about the US subprime mortgage market. At 1.00 pm here (0300 GMT), the dollar was at 119.22 yen, up from 118.88 in early Asia trade, while the euro was softer at 1.3743 dollars, from 1.3750 earlier. Currency traders remain focused on developments in the equity markets as well as the unwinding of carry trades as risk appetite is slashed. CMC Markets chief analyst Ashraf Laidi said despite the deterioration in US housing data, the greenback has been relatively stable as positions were reduced in the carry trade currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars, as well as the selling in the sterling. This flight to low-risk assets was clearly shown in the 11.3-basis-point fall in US 10-year bond yields overnight to 4.785 percent, its lowest since mid-May.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Carry Trades Pressured as Equities Sell/Bonds are Bought Carry trades were pressured to a degree as positve equity markets turned negative. The DOW, which had been up 90 points early in the session reversed course all the way to -130 by 10.45AM. The GBP/JPY, which had been as high as 251.07 dropped to a low of 248.6 as USD/JPY approached 121.0 The fall in equites was mirrored by world-wide falling bond yeilds as traders apparently fled stocks for safer investments. Yeild on the US 10y lost nearly 10 basis points to 4.95. Some of today's movement was attributed to sub-prime difficulties, but disapointing earnings from Google, Catepillar and Microsoft also weighed.

i'm using oanda demo to trade tis hedge strategy. leverage is 50:1 so means instead of $11 per day swap for 400:1 leverage, i shld get ($11/8=$1.375) swap per day rite? rollover int : 1lot Long gbp/jpy +1.305 1lot Short gbp/usd -0.265 1lot Short chf/jpy -0.278 1lot Short usd/chf -0.425 total swap collected $0.337 per day. Even if i ($0.337*8) only $2.696 is collected. may i know how u guys get $11 per day per basket?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
any one using tis hedge?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
no, it should be: $11 per day swap for 100:1 leverage....

--- 帖子 #501 ---
can you show me hw much swap u get for each pair? i cant get even $5 per day..

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Guys... correct me if i'm wrong.. i tink i know wat went wrong.... u all 1 lot is 100,000 units rite? i'm doing 1 lot for 10,000 units. haha... if i follow 100,000units, 1 day my swap is 20 over bucks...

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Seems like you struggling a bit there with the maths... I don't know how you get 20 bucks. And I don't think Oanda would pay that much. On Friday the swap (rollover rates) for FXDD were as follows: GBPJPY Buy +27.02 CHFJPY Sell - 5.62 GBPUSD Sell - 3.70 USDCHF Sell - 8.58 Nett result + 9.12 Therefore: At a 100:1 leverage = 9.12 At a 200:1 leverage = 18.24 etc. Hope this will help. I have been demo trading the system. Will post the results later. It did very well. I got out right at the top though, almost doubling up in a month's time.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
May i know ur 1 lot is hw many units?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Standard lot i.e. 1 lot = $1000 representing a $100 000 worth of currency In other words 100:1 gearing...

Where r u guys who post message in this thread? have u all gif up tis system or u all had gone rich n abandon the thread? to those newbie who juz happen to read tis thread, i can assure u tis is a system tt really works... i have been demo for 20days n i like the results... u will c ur balance increase everyday.... plus i had try modify tis system abit. if lets says all pairs of the same currency is in profit, i wuld close them n reopen them again... tried on oanda using 400USD capital n now i had 460 in balance... results will be better if u have a 200:1 leverage but it means u nd more starting capital... can i request all those who r using tis system to reply ur feedback...

The most recent unwinding I had horrible drawdown.

does your calculator still work , when i try to log in i get errors

--- 帖子 #513 ---
but didnt hit margin call rite? balance kp on rising?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hello, You must be a nut to trade this basket without hedges or stops. Good time to enter now. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...5&amp;d=1186578197 Maybe something like this would be more appropriate. Interest is less, but the equity curve is headed in the right direction and it does not suffer sudden drawdowns. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...6&amp;d=1186578197 Coder

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Ran these 4 pairs into my backtest indicator. From 8/1/05 till now 8/10/07 STarted $2000 full account, RISK 25% of capital. Biggest drawdown $-700 Current balance $3701. Interest total approx $905 I guess if you start with big capital and risk more you will make a killing Seems stable!

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hi Neo, Thanks for sharing the interesting system. ... I have a quick question. You stated 3 pairs are devastating in the DD (drawdown) time; however, you weren't so negative about, when someone posted his/her 3 pair results in the thread where USDCHF was excluded. Infact, the negative swap of this USDCHF pair, which variies -8 to -9 dollars depending on who you trade with, gives a huge positive effects to the overall daily swap gains. For example: FXDD ........... 11 (4 pairs) will improve to 19 (w/o USDCHF) IBFX ............. 8 to 17 ODL ............... 19 to 28 Velocity4X ........ 12 to 21 My question is: Had one excluded USDCHF from your 4 pairs and traded, what negative effects would it have caused during the DD periods, such as end of Feb 07 and just recently since around 20th July, compared with standard 4 pair trades. Would it have been so huge that it would have cancelled off the substantial addition of swaps by the USDCHF exclusion? I am forward testing your system, with the 4 pairs and it will be an easy task to compare and get the answer myself after several months because I simply exlucde USDCHF and compare on spreadsheet, but it is too long a waiting, hence I want your opinion early on as a creator of the system. Many thanks in advance for your attention.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi, u start off with only $2000 u buy 4 lots n u use up $2000. how you have enough margin to withstand the draw dwn? and also, if u buy 4 lots in day 1, day 2 u dont have enough money to buy .1lot. please explain... now there,s another i wuld like to trt n need u guys opinion. if u start an account with $2000, u buy G/U 1 mini lot n .1 mini lot everyday, will tis work out? because u r averaging the value everyday. plz bombard me with answer...

--- 帖子 #518 ---
No I did not buy 4 lots they were see image. This was on a full account of $2000. Spread and interest calculated

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi Fab4x, Very impressive, but how did you figure on those pairs as well as quantities? Do you just leave it on indefinetly do you choose any triggers to enter or exit? Please share with us. Tks Berdj

--- 帖子 #520 ---
No i just enter at the start of the day and leave it. You could takeprofit when ever you wish and start again. The number of lots is calculated by unique formula from freedom rocks system. It takes number of pair, capital and risk % into account and gives you a lot sizes based on this info

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Fab4X, Are you willing to share your backtest indicator? I have a similar basket backtest indicator, but yours looks more effecient. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #522 ---
i suppose every1 tt was into tis type of hedging basket bought GBP/JPY. currently it had drop more than 1000pips since its top. So does tis affect the basket? I'm curious about something. will GBP/JPY keep dropping forever? forex is very volatile. so i'm wondering, all pairs cant keep go bulls/bears forever meaning GBP/JPY cannot be drop until the rate is 100 right? if instead of hedging a basket, can i just buy GBP/JPY everyday to average out the price and just collect the interest? your opinion is much appreciated.. plz contribute with ur answer.. any1 also can..

--- 帖子 #523 ---
If you put the Guppy on Monthly chart and zoom all the way out you will see that the bottom is about 10,000 pips down from here! Be careful!

Hi all... whats the situation u all in now?

--- 帖子 #525 ---
i am in a horrible situation. All accounts got margin call.

Wow, this thread really ought to be re-titled, this is not safe at all! So sorry this happened to you.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
This is always the issue with carry trade .. point of entry is crucial .. plus you need to have the account balance and the stomach to withstand unwinding.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
but then, no currency will kp on dropping forever..

--- 帖子 #529 ---
izzit u over margin? r u using tis hedge system?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi Boostrade, I am trading with your method. I do the trade according your criteria...what happen if i only close the winner positions and replace it for other position at the same caracteristics and leave open the loser position until this be winner...i am founding witn this, take profits and don´t close loser positions... This is correct or not? Thank you very much!!!

--- 帖子 #531 ---
have worked someone NZD/USD USD/JPY and NZD/USD???

from tis method, taking tis recent unwind for example, u r losing alot of pips when yen r strong...

got some question to ask some genius. You know people hedge currency like buy 1 lot gbp/yen sell 1 lot gbp/usd sell 1 lot usd/yen. becoz of price diff, end up it's actually usd/yen. so mind as well long usd/yen. swap will be much more also. correct me if i'm wrong. plus if i buy 1 mini lot with margin need is $50 per mini lot, i get $2.86 swap if i long gbp/usd alone. lets say i got balance wit $100000, i buy 1 lot everytime it drop 100 pip, wuldnt i be very safe? lets say i bought at highest which was 250.00 den it drop to lowest 220.00, i wuld haf entry about 30times which means 30lots. i use up margin $1500. avg bought wuld be ard 242.84. unrealised P/L 46500pip which is also $46500. 46500+1500= 48000. u still left 52k to play with it. plus the swap u take everyday is 61usd per day. 1 mth which means 1.8kusd. will tis work? isnt tis better than hedging here n there? any opinion?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
This is only if you have really deep pockets.. you are absolutely right.. because buying mini lots with $100,000 account means that you are only using 0.05% margin per position. Even through that credit market crash you would only have used 1.5% margin in total. This is still less than what most systems would recommend. It would definitely work if people could actually STICK to it....but with human nature we have fear and greed, and when those come into play, everything will just fall apart. But what if the average investor only had $5,000 to invest with? We would have to go with 0.5k lots, which are not available. I believe the smallest available lot size is a micro lot, which are 1k lots. This strategy would only work with $10,000 minimum... But when you look at it again, what if it keeps going up? Do you keep scaling up? Because buying one mini lot with $100,000 is not the wisest way to invest your money. I think your strategy would only be valid in a downtrending market. Scaling in while you see your losses keep growing is definitely NOT for the faint of heart... Just my 2 cents..

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I think the GBP/JPY is a really good pair to have in a mix of currency pairs just for the interest alone, but it is way too volatile and to solely trade the GBP/JPY is NOT the way to consistent profits... Warren Buffett didn't accumulate his wealth by making big wins here and there....he did it by consistently compounding around 22% a year. -Dickens

--- 帖子 #536 ---
To all the traders who actually tried to implement Mr. Genius' hedging system, I hope you didn't trade with real money because you would have been slaughtered... And I wonder where Mr. Genius went???? -Dickens

--- 帖子 #537 ---
If price goes up every 200 pips, i put in 1 mini lot too... i putting mini lot becoz of my balance so that it is able to withstand all market crashed. if u trade oanda , u can even trade with the smallest unit which is 1. lol.... having earn 1.8kusd per mth means 21.6k per yr which is ROI 21.6% frm the invested $100,000 thats alot right?

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I want to make a simple comment, there is nothing that prevents GBPJPY from easing back to 200 level.. even If it does not make sense that carry trade will suffer that much, but we have to put all possibilities here. I just can't hedge based on that GBPJPY will always recover and carry trades remain safe. With that noted, I do not want to see a big drawdawn in my account. I tested this on demo some time back, and the loss was increasing, over what I actually gain from swap. Now, I have fears that GBPJPY will run another extension below 219 and I can't long it here. Do you suggest other safe-hedging method?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Holypendant, 21.6% ROI is pretty good, I would say, but for the kind of risk your account is put at, I think you would deserve more than 21.6% per year. The market can easily reverse on your position one day, and believe me, GBPJPY is one of those pairs which you don't want to be on the wrong side of.... Let me ask you a question, are you the kind of trader who likes to take a lot of risks and go for the big trades, or are you the kind of trader who wants to be consistent and wouldn't mind small consistent profits (and interest)? -Dickens

--- 帖子 #540 ---
i wan to find a trading system which is simple n dun haf to monitor chart everyday. i dun mind small int tts y i'm goin to use the method i suggest on oanda. buying 100unit for every 100 pip chge . i had already make an order for gbp/yen range from 250 to 190 every 100 pip. thats about 60 entry.

What is the average return on this strategy yearly? I have a managed account manager that hedges and I get 50-70% yearly on my money. Can this beat that?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
u get 50-70% a yr n u asking for more? lol invest in 1million n with ur hedging account, u dun haf to work anymore... wat manage account u using?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Cant post websites here.. pm me for traders info. I'm not asking for higher returns than that. .. just wondering what you could expect in returns from this strategy. I've been with the manager for 6 months personally. I am always looking into diversification no matter how good an investment is doing for me.......

--- 帖子 #544 ---
How much management fee is your account manager charging you? I'm assuming that the 50-70% yearly return is before management fees, but I could be wrong. Personally I still don't like the idea of turning my money over to someone and relinquishing control. It just doesn't make me feel comfortable. I think you should always be 100% in control of your own trading capital, but that's just me. -Dickens

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I'm testing tis method of trading and i had some doubts. if ur profit is over 500pips, shld i close it and open another rate or shld i leave it open n collect swap? lol...

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Am I missing something here? I've found the ibfx mini &amp; standard swap rates, and if you take this system with those rates you would have a negative swap. I'm a newbie so if I didn't get it go easy on me

Hi forexwoman! Looks like you've changed your strategies from carry trades. I wanted to start a strategy provided by neo1001 I'm curious to know why your not doing it anymore? Too slow? Losses? Any feedback would be greaty appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hi neo. I saw your website about trading when news releases. I recently took a big dip (drawdown) the other day because of an economic meeting... G20 ? I hope your still profiting from "the safe hedging system" I want to do this for a long time... long term. Do you think it's possible... Are you still using this system? Any feedback would be helping me to succeed. Thanks

--- 帖子 #551 ---
The strategy is no longer working as swaps are very little for these pairs

--- 帖子 #552 ---
what about usd/zar pair? Nice to hear from you!

--- 帖子 #553 ---
if you want to try this system then using status monitor to see if broker will pay you swap. however most of broker do not paid swap, they want you to paid for it.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hi every body Can some one explain how they calculate swap they must be changing swap + to - and - to +! Or If any broker give swap $1 one day then are they paying $1 all months how it work sorry for english thanks

--- 帖子 #555 ---
At a set time every night your broker will add or subtract the swap. The interest rates for aud at the moment is 3.75. The interest rate for jpy is 0.1. If you have bought audjpy and you are holding it overnight you will recieve your position size + 3.75% for the aud you own and pay 0.1% on the jpy you are selling. Brokers are well known for manipulating this figure and I'm sure they don't all pay you exactly what they should but an honest broker will pay you something in the ballpark of the above calculation. Of course if you are selling aud and buying yen then you pay them the interest.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
An interesting hedge at the moment is to wait until audjpy and nzdjpy have made a swing down and look like moving up then buy audjpy and nzdjpy and sell usdjpy and chfjpy. You are more or less hedged on the pairs you own, you will collect positive swap for every day you hold it open and as audjpy and nzdjpy appreciate the hedge goes positive due to imperfect correlations. The downside risk is fairly small and you can set yourself a limit you are willing to risk on the hedge and close out if it hits it. Rarely does, I do this every now and then when the conditions look right.

rate interest everywhere are almost at zero, so it's not possible to make good income from the swap. Let's wait until rate interest rise .

it is interestingthanks

Yes, alot of rates are at zero, but there are still rollover being paid daily if you pick the good pair. The original basket is probably not applicable anymore, which is normal as interest rates change through time, but possibly another basket could be chosen that is "near" hedged and pays daily rollover. I was trading a larger basket before with nearly the same idea, but with flawed money management. I will try trading this in a small sub account and see how I go. Anywone still trading this out there ?

Hi Guys. I'm very new to using hedge strategies but I know the basics. I love trading but I love it when I don't have to stress about it. I was browsing around when I've found this thread and must I say I'm glad I did. Yes this stratey still works perfectly. I'm using a demo account at the broker OctaFX. I'm trading on their cTrader platform and the best thing is I pay zero swap. Literally nothing and thus making this strategy up most profitable with little to no stress. Yes you will get a draw down but the reason therefor is that during the day and the different sessions in the world the swap reduces and increases. I've found that during the New York trading session the swap is most valuable meaning you can take your profits. During the Tokyo session I've found the swap to be at it's lowest meaning your account is currently in a drawn down or it is the most perfect time to enter. This up and down motion keeps repeating itself. So yeah this strategy works like a charm. Here is his way a bit more clarified: You don't have to start trading with $3.5K (you can actually start with $80 on a 500:1 account but then you are going to start off with very small profits but trust me if you leave your portfolio to grow it will become big.) You put your orders in on the pairs as he says in his first post but with 0.01 lots per trade if you are starting of with $80 if not and you are starting with the 3.5K then put them in exactly as he posted. (hence you must try to put the orders in following each other as quick as possible) Now keep in mind this order is set to find the most optimal time to enter the trades. (you keep an eye on your P&amp;L and the time to see when during your day or your time zone is the most optimal time to enter.) Now that you have found the average time your P&amp;L is at it's highest and lowest, you now know when to enter the market (your opening trades should still be open)) When your P&amp;L is at it's lowest you open 1 more set of trades but this time with a 0.1 lot size($3.5K) or 0.01($80) You keep doing this for about 10 trading days straight Then you can decide if you want to close all the trades when you are in the Highest profit time of the day and start the 10 day cycle again with bigger lot sizing or you can add more sets of trades the following days. (just remember when you want to close a trade to take profits you must always close the whole set of the same set of trades to be able to close the one specific trade otherwise you might lose a lot of equity) So there is it. Always start of with a demo account. I hope this helps a lot of people struggling to make profits in trading. #Remember you can lose your money just as fast as you can make it. And if you don't work for you money you will never get what you want. So being patient with this can make you a lot of profit. Happy Trading Rico

I think you always need to trade live as soon as possible in Forex, it is the only way BUT, always with a micro account to mimise your losses, and for the first 5 years of trading you will lose your money :-( For this strategy I think a key is keeping a close eye on your equity, only taking a new batch of trades at certain levels, not every day as suggested, and regulary taking profits when a bathc of trades is in the black; the swap is a happy side effect

I hate to say it but yes it works but once again it turns out to be more fundamental than just sitting back and enjoying life. The sad thing is I can't seem to find something that can make one less stressed about having a good life without draining your mental state to a point where trading or even life is no longer possible.

Interesting hedging strategy using swaps, but need to manage 4 pairs, which can be difficult, if all the trades are not in your way. Most of the times, we encounter more paper losses than winnings. If you have 4 pairs, then your loss will be quadrupled if they don't go your way. We tend to let losses run. This strategy needs a cut loss for each pair. If you win, your winnings will be small, as we tend to close them too early, due to uncertainty in the market.

You can use the swap strategy and earn a minimum of 5% profit per month. I can not show this strategy in public. But this strategy is stable profit actually

Hi chithanh_85, Thanks for the post, so can you share with us your strategy? Look forward. TQ!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi Chithanh! Is there any way you can elaborate more on the swap strategy? I am looking at correlations and interest rates trying to find pairs that can make the strategy work at this present time. I'd like to private msg you but I am not able to due to my profile being a junior member. If you can and if you ever see this message it would be greatly appreciated if we could discuss this. Thanks

I had been looking into this too. Instaforex has a video on this system. Inserted Video I found a broker that allowed me to have a swap free and a standard account. I had a carry trade strategy going on demo with the eurtry. Unfortunately the broker liquidated. Is it possible to purchase eurtry cash without margin?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
What if you bought straight from a money exchange and hold hard currency. Short EURTRY via leveraged account to collect swap. The rate on XE is not far from my broker https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter...rom=EUR&amp;To=TRY

It is unlikely this strategy will work. If it was possible, the broker would be doing this all day and night. For the reason one poster said in this thread, it is likely the net swap of the hedge would equal to zero, presenting a no-arb condition. The OP's method is theoretically good, given the right conditions it would work but the broker is aware of this and ensures that swaps are set such that arbitrage opportunities are not possible. If they were, they would be doing it themselves and take away that opportunity from you, by using your positions (or more accurately, the exposure) to collect the profit and not share any with you i.e. net swap equal zero for you, but (perhaps) not for them as real swap rates might be different, where there may actually be a differential that could be exploited, but have you pay that differential by showing you different swap rates that net out to zero. However, the great thing about this thread is that OP and others are thinking outside of the box and enjoyed reading this one.

Free Hedge EA from me

--- 帖子 #268 ---
@TSecRepublic The EA had a compile problem on line 798. I fixed it by changing the final return value to false instead of -1. Inserted Code //not enough money message to continue the martingale if(TK &lt; 0) { if(GetLastError() == 134) { err = 1; Print("NO MONEY!!"); } return (false); } } I didn't fix the other 4 warnings, or do a deep dive into it's operation. I will play with it as time allows. Thanks for the share.

basic plan now would be to sell jpy and buy usd aud and gbp , but this has been going on for a few years now, with chances of further rises muted moving forward you would need to guess which one of these might raise rates into the future and buy the dips now possibly selling chf/jpy as a hedge or play with TRY and ZAR?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
With the recent dip in GPBJPY, is this a good time to hop in and start building a LT position with this strategy?
