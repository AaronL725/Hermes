Marrey Math is so genius math for trading based on support and resistance

Great work, bro. I will practice this method.

Thank you so muck !

Just took a trade using the 1 minute settings for Murray Math S/R, and it went for +15 off the -2/8 bounce, not sure if luck and what not but surely an indicator is only as good as the amount of people looking at it / the S/R level. It was weird too because there was no visible 1 minute S/R, next to the -2/8 level but it bounced right off and price took off. Looking forward to testing some more.

Two more bounces -2/8 from GBPAUD, and -1/8 from EURCAD. I find that bounces are stronger when in confluence with trend lines, from AutoTrendChannel.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Here price broke the +2/8 line which is why you see my sell order appear to come in at 7/8 line, it just recalculated once it broke, but nonetheless another good trade taken from the 2/8th line. I'm a little baffled as to why this actually works, at least for the last 3 hours that I've been monitoring it (on and off since I'm trying to do homework right now). Compared to indicators like Fractal S/R, and TLB which is my go to, this one seems to get the levels spot on. Kind of shocking too because I've been watching it from about 10 pm est to now, which are usually dead hours for the market but have still given me some pretty good trade set ups.

After reading up on Murray's theory, and watching some of the video the only reason I can conclude as to why it works is that price of course always pulls back after a strong movement. The +- 1/8 and +- 2/8 lines represent the "extreme" S/R for each of these strong movements. The video and other websites claim that 95% of the time price will pull back if reaching the +- 2/8th level. While these lines don't vary that much from the lines the TLB indicator gives me it does a good job of getting it right the first time. Previous indicators would draw S/R lines that, although appear to be good areas to buy/sell, merely get broken and then redrawn till they reach the level where price bounces.

At last a new thread on MurreyMaths, great stuff following with interest, good luck

nice

murray math graf & quantum

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Just to keep the thread ticking over, 2 charts from today, to be honest not sure what the quantum side of the thread is about

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I don't really understand the point of, or how to use the quantum indicator either, it just seems to paint lower lows and higher highs. I just look for an extension to the -/+ 1/8th and 2/8th and then wait for rejection.

This statement comes from most of the sites I have visited regarding Murray Math Lines:

"Now, if price moves beyond the +1/8 or -1/8 lines, then 95% of the time it will reverse when it hits +2/8 or -2/8. Remember, the market was already in overbought (8/8) or
oversold (0/8) mode, so once we push that to the extreme (+2/8 or -2/8) it is extremely unlikely (95% chance) to reverse."

This makes some sense because whenever I trade off the 2/8 lines stochastics show that price has been overbought/oversold for a while. I would like to know the calculations that go into each line however. Do they factor in time versus price movement and thus assign a level of extreme support and resistance? Or is it really as simple as the video says where the market always pulls back in 1/8ths? That seems a little ridiculous to me.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
lol me too i dont understand it but it sure sounds cool though

Just my 2 cents! Just place price alerts near overshoot areas and wait for price action. I took a long on Eur/Nzd on the 22nd. Its in plus but I will wait till it goes to 3/8 levels before I adjust my sl.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Do you use the same Murrey number for all the different timeframes you look at  or stay with just 1, Murrey numbers 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 here would be 2 extreme setups 1st a 1min scalp trading chart followed by a Daily long term view of how I would look at your pair, let me just add I am self taught so still learning about finding the best way to use MurreyMaths

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thanks, definitely a good read.

His post and many others claim that these 1/8th levels are how big money (or at least some funds) mark their trading levels, which is a brave claim to make yet these levels do seem to validate those claims since price does respect them very well.

The best way I see this traded is to look to the daily and hourly levels as a guide, and then trade the +-2/8 overshoots on the one minute time frame in the direction of the hour/daily, based on what that post says. The reason this interests me is because it is the first Support and Resistance (to me at least) where the S/R actually means something. Anyone can draw S/R lines, but whether or not price will bounce off them is a whole other game. Even if they bounce off them, if the interest isn't high enough price could break through them right after. The Murray lines actually serve as levels and a guide for price direction.

In addition the only lines that really matter for higher time frames in my opinion are the 0, 4/8, and 8/8 lines the rest are trading ranges. If you use the other lines to gauge direction I think it gives too many signals.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Well thought out reply thank you, what I try to do is to try and gauge the possible range for the day and use the levels as targets trailing my stops behind me also at levels, dependant on your Murrey setting the lines (Octaves) will be 15, 31, 62. 122, 244 apart, Murrey says the markets like to make 3/8ths & 5/8ths moves

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Gonna demo trade these levels this week. Only trading 1 Minute +/- 1/8 and 2/8 levels when extremely overbought/oversold and strong price movement/volatility.

Also trading initial bounces off of the 8/8 0/8 +- 1/8 and 2/8 levels on the hourly chart.

Only trading bounces because after that the probability of trades from these levels decreases significantly.

First trade is off the 1/8 level  (it recalculated hence why it looks like it is in between the levels rather than off of it), heavily overbought and strong price movement prior to the trade indicated volatility and interest. Generally if price is slow to reach a point it is slow to bounce off.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Sorry I didn't see your post , just saw It now.

I use murrey_math_line_x eng indicator.

I use only 1hour time frame and I change the input mmperiod to 240 min(4 hour) .

I have these settings on all pairs. I place price alerts on the extremes. If a price alert gets triggered I check for price action. If there is a strong rejection from these areas I enter a position and use proper sl and mm.

That's all, I don't want to go crazy with all the other different levels. Its impossible to successfully scalp these levels IMO.

So stick to high probability trades with proper mm and risk.

Just by studying the system over the weekend and making trades tonight, I just have a few takeaway points about Murray Math Lines...

-They are extremely accurate and well respected. They are the only indicator, S/R-wise, that I am running right now. No daily pivots, or anything and they work fine.

-Fresh bounces are obviously the best. Meaning it hasn't been hit recently.

-If there is strong movement to the level then it means a bounce is likely, however wait for the pullback. You can see if people are looking to sell or buy based on how much price is whiplashing before it actually hits the level.

-Only the +- 1/8 and 2/8 levels should be used for minute 1 scalping when price is extremely overbought/oversold, these represent extremes and increase the likelihood of a profitable reversal. These bounces are usually at least 5 pips, unlike other levels. I use stochastics to see how long and how much price has been oversold/overbought. The more stochastic has been sitting at the top or bottom the better. That means price wants to reverse, and if it is at one of these extreme levels, the probability for a good trade is high.

-Fresh 1 hour bounces at the 0, 8/8 and +/- 1/8 2/8 levels are the strongest, wait for a pullback though because price could just burst through. Nonetheless, these levels can produce 10-20 pip bounces in less than 10 minutes.

EDIT: I previously stated that I would trade the 1 minute in the direction of the one hour and daily lines, however I find that it doesn't really affect profit for scalping the 1 minute levels. I only use the higher time frame levels for higher probability and profit scalps.

Hello Hibra68,

Thanks for your inputs on how you trade. When you get a chance, could you please a chart. It will be much appreciated...

I echo aaven post thank you and good trading

Thank you, I'll try to keep posting charts every night until I decide whether or not to go live with the system. Then I'll start a Trader Journal. I have always been a high leverage scalper type, and these lines have really been a game changer. If I go live I think a 3 step martingale money management system would work pretty well given the high probability trades. Since the probability of a profitable trade is about 75% off key levels on the 1 minute chart, and 95% for 1 hour bounces, I think martingale might actually work. Ex: First trade would be .5 lots, if I lose I go to 1.0 lots. I have yet to lose twice in a row with this system, and trades that are lost were always in profit at one point. I just got greedy .

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hy...which setting are you using for Murray math at 1 minute tf?

Thanks

Regards

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Rnsfrd,

Thanks for extra effort in posting the charts.

You have noticed a high probability trading off hourly charts. Is it restricted to +/- 2/8 levels or as well +/- 1/8 levels as well?

On a side note, I am curious as to the introduction of martingale [I have a very basic idea of how martingale plays out].  Any specific advantages the introduction of Martingale offers in place of the traditional MM that comes with the standard trade of either Profit or S/L?

Good luck with Going Live... Will be looking forward to your journal.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I use the 1 minute levels for the Murray Math Lines, so under period you should put 1 or 0 (this automatically sets the period to whatever chart you are using). I would advise you to have a second chart open with the higher time frame Murray Math Lines like the Hourly, 4 Hour, and Day lines so that you aren't trading near those levels, since price might spike near them. Hourly, 4 hour and Daily take priority over minute levels. I just scalp the minute levels until I reach a higher time frame level.

I don't use 5 minute or 15 minute because those give less signals, and the one minute levels provide accurate enough signals, with minimal draw-down. This is just my personal preference. I'd rather risk 1 or 2 pips for 5-10 pips because I scalp with high leverage. The only time I will check the 5 and 15 minute levels, is if I see that a 1 minute level is ambiguous, meaning I think price could turn at several points, and am not really sure which one. Then I would look for confluence with higher time frames like the 5 or 15 minute.

No problem

OAPDave posted a link (http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...52#post4201852) where a member outlined a high probability strategy for trading the hourly levels. I'll just outline the main points and what I took from them.

"Lets trade from Level +1 to Level 8. This one scenario repeats itself over and over and over. 8-9 times out of 10 as Price will hit the Level +1 the first time, it will move back down to Level 8."

"What if, you only made a trade based on the first time the Level +1/8 was hit in an hour's time period or even during a session such as London or New York. Meaning, the first time up to bat at level +1/8, the odds of it moving back to Level 8/8 is like 95%. The second time it attempts a move back from Level +1/8 to Level 8/8, the odds are greatly reduced."

"So you take the first hit, but don't take the second hit (Million Dollar Tip There). Or if you take the second attempt, reduce your lot size to represent the higher level of risk."

"Its a way to make great gains, the trend is down, go for it. WHOA.. STOP. If your reading this, and the market has moved down to level 2 and is looking as if it is about to break going down to Level 1 and Level 0; DO Not Be A Seller. When you are a bit more advanced, you can trade the break of Level 2/8 to Level 1/8. But until then, don't do it. The worse thing that will happen is that the market will move lower and you miss the trade. But there is only a 5% chance of success here."

"If during this sell down this is the first time down to Level 1/8 or 0/8 or -1/8, particularly -1/8 then expect the bounce to occur from the -1/8 level. If you only made this one trade 1 time a session x 1 session per day x 3 days per week at +40 pips per trade (remember we are on a EURJPY 1 hour chart) x 2 standard lots x 50 weeks = about $120,000 usd per year not including potential slippage, commissions etc. Here is what we know: This occurs on all time periods, all pairs multiple times per session per day providing a multitude of opportunities."

What I gather from this is that the hourly +/- 1/8 levels are the most important if you want high probability set ups. I have also noticed that price often goes through the 8/8 and 0/0 levels often and bounces from the +/- 1/8, so I don't think I would take the bounces from 0/0 and 8/8, but as I stated before I'm scalping with high leverage so I personally am looking for the best possible set ups.

I took the -1/8 level on GBP/USD1 hour chart last night and it went to +50 with a 2 pip draw down.

If you have a higher tolerance than me then the important hourly levels are 8/8, 0/0, 4/8, and +/- 1/8. I am only looking at +/- 1/8.

As for the +/- 2/8 levels, I suppose those do provide higher probability set ups, however the post from the thread did not mention them in terms of the hourly chart. As for now I look at the major EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, +/- 1/8 levels on the hourly charts for 95% set ups. I look at how much price is bouncing before it hits it. If you see price trying to go up but slipping down a lot, that means there is a lot of interest in selling or a lot of stops built up there. Watching price before it hits a level is key. You should want price to be going crazy, moving a lot --> increased interest.

I also conclude that you must take the bounce from these levels the first time, the second bounce your chances are reduced. I also gather that besides these +/- 1/8 levels on the one hour chart, it is fair game for price to go up or down before it hits that level as he states and your chances of a profitable trade are reduced. Trading breaks is always risky, I rather wait for that +/- 1/8 bounce on the hourly chart and take my almost guaranteed 20 pips for the day. I scalp the 1 minute +/- 1/8 and 2/8 1 minute levels while I wait for the hourly level to get hit.

As for martingale strategy, I only consider it because the probabilities for profitable trades is fairly high. Meaning if a +/- 1/8 level has a 95% chance of producing a profitable trade then a martingale strategy should be fine. But that is gambler's fallacy, thinking that 2 isolated events share the same probability, thinking that I have to win the next one because I lost the previous one, is false. I would probably only apply a martingale if I was using the same pair. I.e. if price did not bounce from the +1/8 level, I would double my lot size and trade the bounce from the +2/8 level. That is an edge because the chances that price doesn't turn at both the +1/8 AND +2/8 on the same pair is very slim. It would not make sense to have a losing trade on +1/8 from EUR/USD, and then go double my lot size on USD/JPY since they are isolated pairs (not technically since they are correlated, but this is going to end up turning into a statistics class so I'll just leave it at that).

The basic idea is that I think losing twice in a row with this system is pretty rare so why not use a martingale system to compensate for the previous loser AND make a decent profit on the second trade. But to be fair I probably won't employ a martingale for this, because when using a martingale you have to set it up for a worst case scenario. Meaning I would probably need to make sure the account survives at least 5-7 losses in a row to be safe, and this would be less profitable than if I just used basic MM with a fixed lot size, since a martingale would always start at a low lot size, decreasing my profits.

Thanks vgyuszko for sharing an interesting system.

Below is my Axiory demo results NU M1, com 10$ (high for demo 6$ real). Only two days running the EA as is - seems running 24/5.

What is your pair selection and TF criteria? Is the running time during London session suggested as the EA name implies?

Am testing UJ M1 as well. Will upload results after a week or so.

Cheers,

Akira

Best to stay out when the market runs flat like this, no clear levels to trade off of, no clear trade plans or set-ups = getting stopped out by random movements. I suppose there is a small trend here but if you notice price is moving pretty erratically, flat then spurs of price, no clear pattern.  Going to wait till morning.

Rnsfrd,

Reread the post again. Great Insights!!!

Could you kindly help me in better understanding the following:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1. Trading the 1st bounce: Highlighted in Red

Does the bounce has to be a virgin?{for a lack of a better word}

I mean, Within MM lines for a setting of 64 Periods, does the bounce has to the first time? In other words, do we only take the trade when we shouldn't be able to find a bounce off +/- 1/8 when we look back at previous 64 bars?

(or)

Can the bounce can be fresh? Example: The previous bounce was around 32 bars back, and as it is a bit long, we consider the current one bounce as valid?

2. "I also gather that besides these +/- 1/8 levels on the one hour chart, it is fair game for price to go up or down before it hits that level as he states and your chances of a profitable trade are reduced."-->Highlighted in Black.

Could you please elaborate more on the above?

I mean if price crossed 8/8, but did not touch +1/8, but fell down a bit and now if comes again to +1/8 the chances of winning is reduced as opposed to directly bouncing off +1/8 after crossing 8/8?

3. Do you take the trade once price touches +1/8 or wait for it to cross +1/8 and stall (or) look for any other confirmation?

Thanks for you patience...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I would say yes, but I believe you could have gotten in at a much better price. Your chart shows that you bought when price bounced back higher than the -1/8 line, unless you were trying to catch the -1/8 bounce. If you look at the minute one chart you will see that price burst through the -1/8 line and bounced at the -2/8 line twice. I would have wait to first see if price bounced from the -1/8, and if it went through I would have surely taken the -2/8 bounce. Was your intention to enter at the -1/8 or -2/8 line?

Note: The first pink line shows the -1/8 level, and the second pink line shows the -2/8 level on the hourly time frame.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks for answers... My intention was to enter at-2/8 level but with spread enter was in the middle... My mistake maybe is entry at second attempt and not before... Or not?

Regards

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi aaven,

I'm as new to this system as anyone else is so what I say is just based off of what I have studied and examined this first week trading it.

1. The bounce does not have to be the first in the 64 periods. He stated that it should be the first for that session, preferably a New York or London session. First bounce for the day, not the week or month, or whatever period setting you choose.

2. This is very tricky and something I still struggle with when it comes to scalping. What happens if there is a strong reversal before price reaches the level. Let's say it comes within 1 pip of the level and then has reverses strongly? I would suggest to not re-enter the second time, and even worse do not enter the bounce after it has made a strong move. Even if price did not touch it, there was enough interest to sell at that level, and if you re-enter that interest might not be there since they already entered the trade. At the very least, I would not re-enter if all of this happened within a few minutes.

If you look at the chart I posted in my reply before this one, you see price ALMOST hit the -2/8 level and reverse strongly. A couple hours later it actually hit the -2/8 level and did not reverse nearly as strong, despite the fact that it was technically the first time it was hit. What happens here is that whoever is buying or selling during this point decided "price is close enough, I'll front run and buy/sell now even though the ideal price hasn't been hit." These buyers/and sellers are not there to push price the second time if it gets hit, so reversals have a lower chance. This is not to say that these reversals never happen, but the chance are reduced in my opinion.

3. This is tricky as well. What I look for is first, increased interest around a level, which can be shown by large bars leading to that level, or price whipping back and forth before that level. That signifies interest. As for the level itself, once I realize there is interest, I generally want to take trades where price stops or either goes through my level and starts to reverse.

Because what happens is, lets say price does not touch a level and starts to reverse. It very well could be a good idea to enter now, when price is 3-5 pips away from my desired level since it could go for another 10 pips, BUT what if price decides to reverse and hit the original level, well now I'm down 5 pips and price could go higher, to the next level. This has happened to me a lot. I have a fear about missing out on the reversal so I enter before it reaches my price. Then it turns out price reverses and reaches my original price. I could have gotten in at a better price but I did not wait, and the 5 pips that could have been profit are now drawdown.

I realize that not every set up is going to be ideal, and price is not always going to reach the level I want it to before reversing, but in my case, I'd rather wait for the ideal set up where price reaches, or goes through and then pulls back before entering.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Ah, yeh GBPCHF spreads run high, which is why I've been trying to avoid them. Once you account for commissions and spread you're already down about 3 pips. But if your intention was to enter at the -2/8 level, I'd say that's good. I personally might have not taken it because there was an extremely strong reversal near that point an hour or so before, and you would notice that price did not pick up as fast the second time around when you entered, it stalled a little before. I wouldn't call it a mistake because it is the appropriate level to enter, I think it has to do with your risk tolerance. The post I linked before  mentioned if you want to enter on a second bounce to perhaps reduce your lot size to compensate for the added risk.

Discipline at it's best. You have given me something to think about...Grateful for this...

Thanks

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Exit strategy is still tricky for this, I find that on the 1 minute chart, 5 pips is reasonable, and if I'm trading off 1 hour levels, then 10 pips is reasonable to catch from a bounce before it retraces. Catching 4-5 of these moves a day isn't too hard.

I am aware that a lot of these 1 minute and hourly bounces can be scaled into larger trades, but again I'm just scalping the initial bounces. I do not have a system for re-entering trades, or deciding what happens to price after the initial bounce. I cannot predict that with much accuracy. Sure I might miss out on a 50 pip move, but I'd rather take my 10 guaranteed pips over and over.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Rnsfrd,

The movement from +1/8 to 8/8 should be more than 10 pips, correct? Does it not take a toll on you vis vis the stress levels of watching continuously?

Please give me your take on this:

I am thinking For sell: Entry on +1/8; Exit on 8/8 and S/L on +2/8

Thanks

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Trade 3 off a 1 minute scalp. Strong price movement up, stochs up above the 80 level so more than overbought, and clear previous resistance. Exited with +5.

To some I guess the Murray Math Lines are a glorified S/R indicator, but to me they aren't necessarily that. They kind of assign weights to each of the S/R. I could draw many S/R lines, and use other S/R indicators, but the lines they draw are often broken and redrawn. With the murray lines I can usually go into a trade knowing, "Ok the +1/8th line should give me a decent move, the +2/8th line should give me a stronger move, etc etc." I have never been able to look at a S/R with as much confidence until these lines. Usually I would go into a trade saying, maybe I can scrape 1 or 2 pips off this scalp, even if it looks like a good S/R line, you never really know what you are getting.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Yes it should be more than 10 pips, however psychologically at least for me, someone who scalps and likes to keep as much profit and get out, I don't like waiting or seeing if it will hit the 8/8 level. The +1/8 to 8/8 level might be 20+ pips depending on the pair and levels, however when I say the initial bounce I mean the movement of price before it stalls or retraces and rallies again. Price from what I've seen, bounces 8-10 pips from hourly levels and then will either return to the +1/8th level and go down to the 8/8 or stall and then push again. Again this is completely up to how you wan to trade it, personally I just rather take my guaranteed profit and get out and look for the next trade.

As for continuously watching price, I don't spend that much time watching the screen. If my laptop is around I will check on the hourly levels and make note of what is close to my key levels of +- 1/8 and 2/8, and set alerts for those, and then scan to see if there are any good set ups on the minute chart. If not I check again later. I find that if I sit and try to wait to find trades, then my trading is bad. I look and force myself to see things that aren't really there, because I am itching to trade and make a profit. If something doesn't pop out at me, I simply just check again later. There are enough set ups on the minute 1 and hourly chart to take at least 5 trades without having to spend all day staring.

As for your strategy, I believe someone developed an EA with those levels in mind, and I myself was considering doing that. I am sure that strategy would work just fine, myself scalping would not risk the +1/8 to +2/8 stop loss however, if I see price go through or start heading the other way, I would exit. But my strategy requires me staring at price which I'm sure many are trying to avoid. I tend to avoid placing orders at levels and waiting for profits to get hit and such mainly because I feel like it is a very subjective area. What happens if price gets within 2 pips of your TP and then turns, and goes past your S/L by .1 pips and then turns. Just because price never really stops dead on to levels, and at least for me, when using strategies like that, I still end up having to babysit my trade because I need to feel out where I'm exiting and placing stops.

Ok what about eurcad and euraud? Are closed by sl right? My order on tf 1h in eucad was stopped..

And what's happen after murray line are changed? Wait for next setup?

EUR/AUD I closed with +3 because I didn't want to risk anything during news. My EUR/CAD trade had a burst down to +12 and then started to pull back a little so I exited with +10, but yes you would have gotten stopped out if you stayed in. That's kind of what I was saying in my earlier post, is that I can't tell you for certain that price will fall all the way back to the +1/8 level, what I can say with a high certainty is that there will be a bounce.

The EUR/CAD trade also was at the +2/8 level and not the +1/8 level where the bounce back to 8/8 is more common.

As for minor pairs, like EUR/CAD which I did trade today, I follow the idea that minor pair technical analysis can only be exploited in the short-term. This is my theory and my idea so you don't have to agree with it. With the exception of news releases, minors like EUR/CAD, EUR/AUD, GBP/CHF, GBP/JPY, are directly affected by the movement of the most heavily traded pairs EUR/USD, GBP/USD. Meaning those minor pairs won't make a large move unless the "master pairs" make a large move. The minor pairs do not affect the majors, the majors affect the minors.

What this means is that, yes I will still scalp the minors off the minute chart, and off the initial bounces on the hour levels, however I will not expect a big move UNLESS the technical analysis from EUR/USD or GBP/USD tell me that a big move is coming, and in that case I would be trading EUR/USD and GBP/USD instead. I do not expect the bounce on a +1/8 minor level to go all the way back down to 8/8, a possible 20-30 pip move, unless the major pair technical analysis agrees with the minor pair analysis.

I will scalp minor pairs, and look for big profits from the major.

For example: Today we both saw EURCAD hit the +2/8 level however one would have gotten stopped out in a few minutes if they stayed in. I was able to keep +10 pips from the bounce because I did not expect it to push much lower than that. However if you looked at the EUR/USD chart, you would see that EUR/USD did not reach it's +1/8 level, so there was no reason for it to have a strong reversal. The strong reversal which is occurring now on EUR/CAD is likely related to EUR/USD hitting it's +1/8 level. If you were just looking at the EUR/CAD you would be baffled as to why it decided to turn at that +1/8 level because there is no apparent resistance near it, but if you look at EUR/USD it would be obvious.

My advice, which you don't have to take, is to still trade the minors but to scalp them, and don't expect large moves unless technical analysis on the majors is in line with them as well.

Rnsfrd,

That's a subtle yet potent nuance you have shown vis a vis the strength of the pair.

So the expected behavior of bouncing from +1/8 to 8/8 is apparent in EUR/USD and GBP/USD, can we include the pairs with USD like NZD/USD or USD/CAD?

Do you consider EUR/GBP as part of the group of EUR/USD and GBP/USD?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Well if EUR/USD and GBP/USD are hitting the +1/8 levels I would advise to trade that pair to get the strongest move. As for NZD/USD, yes, if you saw the +1/8 bounce from EUR/USD, NZD/USD followed it as well, USD/CAD made a move too, but not nearly as strong on the USD/CAD. EUR/GBP will run opposite of what EUR/GBP and GBP/USD are doing. If those two are trending, then EURGBP will run flat, if they are ranging, the EUR/GBP will trend.

What I am trying to say is that the only pairs I would trade confidently for over 20 pip gains are EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY Because these are the majors, and the volume and trades from these pairs are the most, and directly affect the movement of minor pairs. So, since these pairs are the "master pairs" I would have more confidence in technical signals because they are leading, and not affected by the minors. Technical analysis on the minor is affected by the movement on EUR/USD and other majors which is why I only use it for short term gain. If you looked at EURCAD, it did not have as strong a move as EUR/USD it stayed flat. EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD all had really strong reversals from the +1/8 line.

Didn't get to trade today, busy with school but I took some off time to study the system some more. One important thing I came up with is the importance of taking trades only when the price has reached the level for the FIRST time. Notice the 4/8 level, which btw is a very strong hourly level.

Both GBPJPY, and GBPCAD hit the 4/8 pivot level during the New York Session but only GBPCAD reversed while GBPJPY went through. Why did this happen? Well if you look at both charts you will notice that GBPJPY hit its 4/8 level at 23:00 (broker time) and had a significant pull back, where as GBPCAD did not hit it until the New York Session, and that is why it reversed and GBPJPY did not.

Finished a EURAUD trade. First I entered at the +1/8 hour level, but this was dumb because they +2/8 level was very close to it, and the +2/8 level represented a more obvious resistance level. Secondly, I entered the trade about 6 pips early from the level, which I usually preach against but I was so confident that the trend would bounce hard because of how over bought EURAUD was. It reached 150% of its ADR, and would have been crazy to keep going higher. Sometimes a little more analysis allows you to be riskier. I kept adding sell lots the better the price I got in. The +2/8 level was at 1.1.3885, and I sold 3 lots, one at 1.3879, 1.3882, and 1.3886.

Price has dropped almost 20 points since reaching the +2/8 level.

There is no doubting you are on top of your game with the use of Murrey, Brilliant trading my friend, all my charts have Murrey set to 64

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Two trades I just took, one was off the EURUSD, but price action kind of fizzled out before hitting it and bounce did not occur. Exited with -2 pips. Note: I exited really late because my internet died for a bit, but I would have exited early once the break and price action stalled. Bounces from the -2/8 should be pretty quick so if price stalls, something is up.

Second trade was GBPAUD and that was off a clear S/R line from the +2/8 and strong movement towards that level. Exited with about 11 pips.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I believe you have the best set up, to get the daily, hour and minute lined up, I however am not nearly as patient to wait for those trades lol

Later I will post some analysis on Price Action surrounding profitable trades since I believe that is a key factory before taking trades. What is price doing before it hits a key level, or what is it not doing before it hits a "fake level?"

Also noticing why some +/- 1/8 and 2/8 trades on the 1 minute are better than others.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Wonder if you have ever given any thought to looking at a Daily like this, Murrey says he can predict a turning point to within 4 days

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Just wanted to highlight the one (or two) things I have noticed from my winners and from my losers. The first is price action, which I have mentioned many times (sounding like a broken record), and the second is psychology.

1. Price movement/Price action before a level is one of the most important things you could check for before taking a trade. Price movement = interest, that means there are many traders interested in the current price, or wherever price is headed. It means they are likely looking at the same thing you are looking at. The strongest bounces are almost always after the strongest pushes. Think of it like this, how many times do you see price (non news related), suddenly shoot up from a flat range and go for 10-20+ pips? Almost never. I have noticed that almost all of my winning trades were after a big candle.

Pictures A-C show strong price movement before reaching the level.

Picture D shows my recent EURUSD that did not profit because as you see price movement was kind of stalling beforehand. Yes there were 3 strong candles down but then price stalled right before hitting it. If it was a really important level price would have pushed that extra 1 or 2 pips and bounced strongly.

D) - No strong price movement, stalls right before reaching level and then flatlines.

2. Psychology is important as well when it comes to trading. And I am not really talking about your own psychology. I am talking about the collective psychology of all traders in the market, most importantly those with the money. My profitable trades in my opinion are always the most obvious. Professional traders I would imagine don't have many fancy indicators on their charts. I imagine they use basic S/R, and most traders use basic S/R. In addition most of the stops, which= liquidity are made at the most obvious points, highs and lows.

How is this useful? Well there are many +/- 1/8 and 2/8 levels on the 1 minute chart. But not all of them should be taken. In addition the +/- 1/8 and 2/8 levels are often close to each other, which one should you trade off of? Well ask yourself this before going into a trade. If you were any trader, any new trader or seasoned veteran. Where would you place your stop, where would you sell. Where is the most obvious area of support and resistance. If you can't figure that out, and it is not clear to you, chances are it isn't clear to everyone else and the movement will be choppy or not as strong. Finding areas of Support and Resistance isn't hard, but choosing which ones are valid is. The best S/R are the most obvious ones.

For example, today I took a short on the EURAUD +1/8 hourly level when I should have taken it on the +2/8 level. Why? Well if you look at the 1 hour chart, the +2/8 level represents are more obvious area where one might draw resistance. Blue is where I took my first trade (loss) at the +1/8, and the red line is where I entered again for profit, at the +2/8. As you can see if you entered higher than that you would have profited even more.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is an example of my GBP/AUD trade. The +2/8 level was at an obvious level of resistance, anyone would have drawn resistance there hence the strong bounce off of it.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

My last example is again the losing EURUSD trade. Here, besides the lack of strong price action you will notice that the area of support is ambiguous, it could have been drawn at several points, none of which are really clear. If the minute 1 isn't showing you a clear level of S/R, I would advise switching to a higher time frame, it would be clearer.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Takeaway is that if a trade is not obvious to you, it probably isn't obvious to everyone else. The biggest fault of traders is that we over complicate everything. We add indicators, crazy pattern analysis. The more factors you add into a trade the less likely it is to provide an edge in my opinion. What are the chances every trader is thinking the same way as you and your 10 indicator system? Probably very low. What are the chances most traders are looking at the same obvious S/R line, very high.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I never include daily price action in my trade taking. I believe you can only exploit price in the short term. There are many factors that play into price movement within a day. Daily price action is good for scaling trades but at the end of the day you must still use smaller time frames to time exits and entries if you are scalping. For example, if the trend according the MM lines says that price is heading towards the 0/8 level, yes it would make sense in theory to only sell but you might miss out on a bunch of good trades because lets say a 1 hour -1/8 line gets hit, that could be a 30+ trade opportunity that you missed because you are trading in the direction of the daily.

Daily MM lines are good for in my opinion, scaling. But again, there is added analysis required for taking into account the daily. Price could drop 30 points and you might think "Hey it is going to hit the next daily MM line, so I'll stay in this trade for another 50 pips."But then it retraces 40 and hits your S/L. This can happen within a day.   Buying and selling off the retracement into the direction of the daily might help since more people are looking to trade the larger trend, but which retracement will extend the daily trend? You don't know, at least I don't. I cannot figure that out.

Time frame to me is relative to my risk. If I want to risk less than 10 pips I'm not trading higher than hourly S/R levels. I will keep the daily and 4 hour levels in mind, however I do not plan to ever scale my trades into the "larger" trend. If I can exploit levels for 5-20 pips and get out, then that's my plan. Trying to figure out where price will continue is another headache.

I've been into forex for about 3 years and I can tell you I have not been as serious about my trading as I have could been until this thread. Knowing that I have to explain my entries, my exits, my losses, really forces me to define my rules and think before I trade. Knowing that I will post my trades in a thread forces me to take only good entries. Having other members to hold you accountable is a priceless tool to get better at trading, and the discussions you guys contribute really helps me think and forces me to explain everything rather than just coming up with nonsense.

If there is anything I would advise to get better at trading any system is to post EVERY trade you take. It will force you to take only good trades because who wants to post publicly their losers? If you post your losses publicly it will stick with you, and you will naturally try to do better the next time.

Up until now I would just demo and half-ass my entries, basically gambling because it was demo and then expect good results on live. Even if you aren't on a live account, publicly posting your trades can simulate the pressure of a live account.

Great thread. I was introduced to Murrey by @OAPDave on the noise free system. I am very enthusiastic about learning more regarding these levels. It seems that price action and levels are the way to trade. Understanding these are crucial.

I am unsure about all this quantum london stuff. It seems the EA is from the quantum london trading, but not sure how this relates to Murrey. I will solely focus on Manual Murrey trading.

Hi vgyuszko,

I used to use Murry Math Lines a lot in my Trading until I realised what is more important is where the Banks place their Orders to be filled.

I have found they use the .800 / .000 / .200 and .500 Numbers a lot to Accumulate their Orders.

I think, where the Big Institutions place their Orders CREATE the Murry Math Lines rather than the Big Institutions placing their Orders where the Murry Math Lines formed.

The Chart below is the H1 GBP/JPY Chart I have Marked the .800 / .000 / .200 and .500 Levels on the Chart and you can see how closely the Murry Math Lines match these Levels.

Put up any Chart and you will find the same thing.

It's the Levels Big Institutions Trade from that create the Murry Math Lines rather than Murry Math Lines influencing where Big Money Trades from.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
With all due respect I disagree with your observation, you may have a very valid point about the .800 /.000/ .200 and .500 that the Big Institutions use but I fail to see how you observe Murrey is calculated from them

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Dave,

Murry Math Lines are derived from the Rhythm of the Market.

The Market dances to the Rhythm of the Order Flow within it.

It's the Market that dictates where the Murry Math Lines will form not the Murry Math Lines dictating where the Market will go.

The Market only becomes "oversold" or "overbought" when the Institutions have Accumulated their Orders and there is no one left to take the other side of their Positions when this happens the Market will go to the next Level of waiting Orders.

Who ever has the most Orders (Buy or Sell) at any one Level will eventually win out.

Order Flow dictates Market Structure and the position of the Murry Math Lines

MML with Quantum?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Note: example above applies to a long cycle only but a short cycle would work in a similar way except from the top down.

How far have you gone in terms of testing this approach?

Have you looked into making mods to the EA to perform similar tasks that I've outlined in the screenshot above?

As you know the MML lines are difficult to backtest (in MT4 that is) due to the resetting of MML's once the extremes are breached by price/PA.

This suggests that either another far more advanced testing approach be developed and applied (eg. Python and Matlab .... C++ come to mind etc).

Have you dug into this type of analysis at all or do you simply choose a random Quantum depth entry value that is 'fitted' to the current chart and then you turn the Expert Advisor off once enough trades have been generated or you have reached a pre-determined risk level based on your trade details (such as risk per given trade summed over all trades in the Quantum Cycle.

At this stage I can see an approach developing both from a Quantum perspective and by simply trading the MML's by a purely manual approach.

I would tend to think that longer term or hard core manual traders with very good PA trading skills would simply reduce the 'complexity' and trade either a 1 trade at a time appraoch or as another trader commented on here to think about applying a type of martingale approach ay the extreme MML levels such as +1/8, -1/8, +2/8 and -2/8.

Understanding what action to take as a trader under an array of different PA at or near these MML levels is the critical knowledge needed.

Money management and trade management are also crucial but easy enough to apply.

I look forward to a much deeper discussion especially to what level you have gone applying the Quantum method.

Masterrmind ..........

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Wow if we could get you interested this thread would go along way, I only trade manual, I know it obvious but if you start from a big picture you can then just break down the Octaves into smaller sub sets which then become Octaves in there own right on smaller timeframes

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Very nice charts.

I'll be interested to hear what the thread Op has to say mainly from a testing/knowledge point of view of applying Quantum with MML.

The biggest issue with Quantum is the developing DD that is generated due to it either opening more and more entries at higher highs or more and more entries at lower lows.

This is fine until your available margin runs out and then you hit the wall hard.

So money management plays a very big role along with proper risk management.

Ofcourse these can have limits placed on them but if the trend continues the ultimate result is stop out.

The saving grace is a deep enough retracement to draw the Quantum cycle into net profitable territory.

So I can see why the thread Op is attempting to 'mate' Quantum with MML because of the reversal zones out in the +- 1/8 and +- 2/8 MML's.

The combination of Quantum with some of Ganns methods makes sense from a 'reversal of trend' point of view.

Given the 'very high probabilities being stated' for reversals from these outer MML zones.

At first glance it looks super promising for a Quantum Trader because they thrive on an initial trend that collects multiple entries followed by a nice pullback in PA that produces a net gain either per trade or at least net cycle.

My intention is certainly not to come into here and throw complexity into the mix.

Being a manual trader (also use EA's) it appears to be simpler to look for 1 to 2 trades per setup at these extremes and use PA entry techniques.

But I am keen on a discussion and an application of the 'method' since I also trade Quantum albeit from a different perspective.

Hi Dave,

We need to understand that it is the Markets Flow that causes Market Structure.

When we see the Market fall, like in the AUD/USD example below, and then stop and reverse we need to understand the forces that are operating to make this happen.

For every Seller there has to be an equal Buyer to take the other side of the Trade (Zero Sum Market).

What we see, particularly  in the H1 Chart, below is when there are no Buyers left to take the other side of the Sellers Orders the Market falls fast.

It keeps falling until it reaches the next Level of waiting Buy Orders it's here Sellers can off load their Short Positions and build new Long Positions.

This is what the Market does every day simply look for the next Level of waiting Orders to off load old positions and build new ones.

The MMLs are formed by the Rhythm created from the Markets Flow the Markets Flow is generated by the waiting Limit Orders that are placed by the Big Institutions.

It's not the MMLs that move the Market it's the waiting Limit Orders that does this.

I hope this isn't disrupting the flow of the thread I'm simply trying to help people understand what makes the Markets move.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
You are quite right stevepatt. What MM lines do is allow a trader who does not quite see things at your level just follow the lines. Eventually as they get confident with making money the will start to observe patterns around those lines. At some point, they will start looking at every bar for information. All indicators are crutches, including candles. But MM is one of the better ones. Would you agree?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Jmn,

Yes, I would agree it does help with finding extremes in Market moves.

Using the MMLs in conjunction with Market Structure will help with finding turning points.

I preferred using this one.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Not trying to debate whether or not Murrey Lines influence where trades are placed, however I would like to know how people account for the dead on accuracy that they provide. Supply and Demand can really only provide zones of reversal, Support and Resistance is arbitrary, you don't know if one is stronger than the other, and again can only provide zones most of the time, and candle stick analysis is also subjective.

I think to say these lines don't "influence" trades is kind of confusing because then what else explains the preciseness of these reversals, down to the pip? I can use other analysis to give me an estimate of where a decision might be made, but again, if I want the precision required in scalping why is it wrong to say that the lines influence trading decisions? At least in the short term?

--- 帖子 #124 ---

Hi rnsfrd,

I'm not knocking MMLs, I just think it's important to understand that it's the Market dictating where they will be placed and not them dictating where the Market moves to or from.

Big Institutions are not placing their Orders around MMLs but MMLs can form where Big Institutions are placing their Orders this is why they can be spot on at times.

If you take any Market and divide it into equal Segments, which is essentially what MM does, it's surprising how good it is at picking up Trade-able Levels.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi Dave,

I don't know why that is it should be set to 64 like the one posted by vgyuszko.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Supply and demand zones can be rather arbitrary and have wide ranges.

The octaves on the other hand are showing rather uncanny accuracy.

From a manual trading perspective only, we need to ask at least some of the following simple questions:

1. What is it in trading these levels that we wish to achieve?

2. How large of a TP do we seek from our trade entries?

3. At the extremes -+1/8 and -+2/8 does MML offer any advantage over any of the other MML levels or even Pivot Points for that matter?

Based on pre-determined parameter settings it does not take all that long to notice how large some of the pullbacks are from these extreme zones.

I don't know about other traders but what I enjoy from a manual trading perspective is to get into a reversal trade (after reading the chart structure, looking at the order flow and yes I use harmonics too) from within the zone and nailing multiple good trades.

Ofcourse there will be trades that overshoot and smash your SL that's just part of the business.

But over the longer term if we seek the best entries from these extreme zones and seek to minimize as much as possible our DD per trade then surely we are headed in the right direction.

At the end of the day if the MMLs are reasonably easier to decipher (yes they are!) and apply (yet to be seen!) then perhaps all that really matters is how profitable a trader can consistently be.

Why don't all the serious traders load up a TE (demo or live) and let the fun begin just like the thread Op has done.

ps. further discussions can be made on anything to do with this topic however would it not be ideal to discuss some of the winning trades but focus more on the losing trades and why they failed so that all traders get to gain an insight.

Oh yes I agree with the fact that the Murray Lines are a result of big institutional trading, creating the hi and lows for the levels to be calculated from, I just think it is weird that the 1/8th levels are able to pick out areas of buying and selling so well.  I know Murrey Lines do not necessarily control price entirely, but when they hit these important levels we notice that price respects them fairly well, and often in accordance to the probabilities associated with them. In the picture you posted, price had a short reversal at the 4/8 pivot and then a strong reversal at the 8/8, the strong resistance point. I guess what I was trying to say is that, although big money ultimately dictates these calculations, I do believe that they do pay attention to these trade-able levels shown by the MML. Of course these lines get broken and recalculated all the time so it is not a "holy grail" but surely someone with money is paying attention to these 1/8th levels. I could have picked out at least 3 other areas of resistance on your chart, but it decided to reverse at the 8/8th level which is what I consider the benefit of MML; as you said it helps you identify the tradeable levels.

I think a few of us, myself included have shown how they can be applied for scalping and exploiting reversals in the short term. Not many trades have been posted involving long term potential however. I do plan to trade this live on a small account this week or next week, after having pretty good success on demo and continue to post trades. But I agree with you, that the best thing to do is post trades, including, or more importantly the losses.

Very much appreciated.

A functioning dashboard that alerts to multiple zones of interest is highly valuable not to mention a real time saver.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Was hoping someone would provide this!!

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Yes indeed!

Your commentary is what makes this thread great to read so thank you very much for your involvement.

I'll load up a TE specific to this thread with say a 10K demo start (live later) with the main objective to learn from the trading frenzy.

My trading will be a manual approach initially but depending on how I see these levels a Quantum link might be sought.

But manual only trading from me for the first several weeks.

I think a variety of entries from different TFs might be useful.

I think MTF analysis may prove to be useful in MML but lets see.

For the trades that I post here I will endeavor to explain any discretionary trade entries if they veer away too far from the MML mechanical approach this is because I will look for an order flow, PA and candlestick breakdown analysis at and near the zone of anticipated engagement.

ps. thanks for the charts that you post here and especially the annotations they are highly useful.

Quantum with MML

Observation only (I am not trading this setup).

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Plan is to simply allow it to unfold quietly in the background and see what happens.

Whether or not the outcome is favorable does not prove anything one way or the other but it will give me something to think about.

It would not suprise me if the AU pair dropped back down to retest the lows again before charging up.

Option to simply open Quantum trades between the -1/8 to -2/8 zone which would mean that no entries would be currently open.

It should be noted that when price just enters the MML trade zone that I am 'fitting' a Quantum start value.

Simply put it means I am increasing the entry Q box value in the indicator until I get a Quantum box to paint.

Once I get this Q box to paint then the Expert could be set to simply continue opening trades at lower lows provided they remain within the bounds of the MML trade zone.

ps. If there is such a way to reduce the DD in a typical Quantum generated cycle of trades then I want to know about it.

pps. The end result would be to apply a tight cluster of trades entered in the extreme MML zone using high leverage.

Masterrmind............

Great Going Rnsfrd.... Good luck with your going live...

I agree with Master Mind, your commentary made this thread very special...

Thanks for the effort...

--- 帖子 #139 ---
It should also be noted that a Quantum cycle is not necessarily required.

Some other simpler EA or script options may include the following:

1. Apply a constant lot sequence (CLS) grid mapped out within the MML Trade Zone.

2. Apply a progressive lot sequence (PLS) grid mapped out within the MML Trade Zone.

3. Apply a martingale lot sequence based on trade A outcome (If trade A fails apply trade B @ 1.xx*lot Trade A etc etc).

Success will depend on how well the account is preserved (MM perspective) and whether price charges favorably out of the MML Zone.

Afterall no matter how good your MM is there are only so many attempts that can be made before multiple losing trades milk the account dry.

An even simpler approach can also be applied purely by manual trading approach.

The manual approach is what I plan to start trading later today which can include at market and limit orders.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Looking forward to your ideas/analysis.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Yeh I would have to agree with that. I originally thought that using martingale would work with such a system and an EA given the high probability of reversal at the extreme 1/8 and 2/8 lines, but decided that it would reduce profitability since you would have to start at an extremely low lot size, and even then it would probably blow up. I think manual trading with, candlestick, order flow and market structure as you mentioned combined with the accuracy of these lines will produce the best results.

Dash Output ??

UJ Chart [M15; MML: P=64, MMPeriod=240 and StepBack=0]

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Anyone else seeing a difference?

I am assuming that the difference is in the MMPeriod value assigned.

If so might need to address the logic in the Dash especially the period to which the Murrey Math lines are drawn.

Might be useful to include both a P and a MMPeriod as per Murrey_Math1 indicator.

ps. need to make sure the MML calculations are correct as per standard MML.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Lets find out.

What I will be looking for is larger pip pullbacks and I'll start off trading the M15 chart as its central (ie not M1 and not a HTF).

However, at the zone of engagement it is highly likely that a lower TF such as M5 will be used for the actual entry because it shows much more of the PA.

Hopefully I can post in a timely manner the process of entry.

The advantage that I'm looking for in MML is to get a bigger pullback meaning a greater pip count than what I would from following PA and order flow from anywhere on a given chart otherwise it will mean little additional value to me or any other PA trader.

Keep the stops reasonable and realistic and a greater than 1:1 reward to risk ratio.

I also look at actual DD pips per trade compared to the actual TP however when trading at higher leverage I tend to lock in profit sooner rather than later which means this ratio is never that ideal.

The exit will be the interesting part because you can never really tell in advance how price will travel to your stop or your TP.

Interesting times ahead.

The Dash

It looks like the MMPeriod is set=0

So on an M15 chart with P set = 64 and MMPeriod=0 we get the following:

Dash shows this:

So the Dash shows correct data given TF and P provided MMPeriod is set=0.

ps. perhaps an option to input MMPeriod would be useful including the Stepback parameter.

Nice contribution stevepatt. In my view the MM idea is a good structure to build around. It takes a while to see order flow on a naked chart. But with the lines, they sort of frame the picture. I used to use MM also and even had his software for awhile. Like you I eventually just took them off the chart because I started noticing and learning what clusters of wicks did to price action coming from above and below.

In MM parlance trading from 7/8ths to 1/8ths and back is a novel way to use Quantum. Sells at 7/8ths, 8/8ths, +1 and 2/8ths, and hold for the ride down. It's a pretty good idea. You are buying low and selling high, and you're scaling in with a definite stop for the whole position if you are simply just wrong.

It meets every hallmark for a good trading plan.

That's kinda harsh Soros. MM has made no attempt to be commercial. Why persecute someone you do not know?

Hello MasterMind,

If it's not too much trouble, could you post charts of the trade you are going to take or have taken with the reasoning...

OAPDave was the first person to have introduced me to MM and the gist of his posts were to treat MM Lines as a game jumping from One time Frame to another-->MTF if you will....

Rnsfrd did give me a primer for trading the extremes on a single time frame...

When it comes to MTF-Example: Hitting 5/8 level in Daily and now seeing 4HR charts and price near 8/8 etc etc... along those lines...

Trying to get a framework going, but overwhelmed with the lines and the time frames... Looking to learn from your experience...

Thanks

Excellent modification.

If you can provide for each pair Change in Pips/Percentage (selection input for both options) from Daily Open, it will add a lot of value and act as a confirmation for ADR/Daily percentage traders as well as those trading on momentum expansion by comparing Currency groups.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Any indicator that applies the correct MML line segments would be fine.

An mq4 file is better though because you can check the formulas being applied in meta editor otherwise you can't (if only supplied ex4)

I would suggest that you read some of the Murrey math documents towards the start of the thread in terms of typical settings to apply when trading on different TFs.

Try refreshing the Dash a few times or remove it from the chart and reapply it.

Sometimes it plays up and I've looked in the code and noticed a few errors but most of the output (results) appear correct.

Note that the MML Dash applies only a TF and a P setting, it does not have an input setting for MMPeriod or Stepback although one could be coded.

Such a setting would be quite useful since I could match it to my M15 charts as they apply a MMPeriod = 240 NOT 0 as the Dash applies.

This makes a huge difference in terms of location of MMLs.

At the end of the day though the idea will be to seek out major runups of momentum to these extreme levels in the form of large aggressive candles followed by a stall in aggression and signs of strength being trasferred to the other team (bulls to bears or bears to bulls as the case may be).

Note: Check out the fibonacci ratio at the -1/8 level precisely where I'll be looking to get into the market (if price ever makes it there).

This is what I've been patiently waiting for however it is still not in the zone.

The little bounce up from near the 0/8 level was also tempting but I decided a lower drop would be ideal.

No guarantees it will be today in any case ... 1st trading day of the week can be slow at times when there isn't alot of data coming out.

However, PA can come out of nowhere so you need to be aware at all times.

NY Open only about 15 minutes away so lets hope the market moves a little in our favor.

IF not then I am still happy with the 1 trade.

I stick to my original Murrey Indicator, hence do not use the one posted on page 1, what I do is use Murrey sequence of numbers 4,8, 16 ,32, 64,128,256,512,1024 etc then my aim is to match a number to a timeframe that gives me 15,31 or 62 pips difference between each line, it usually matches by using the though pattern of how many mins in the day, how many 5min in the day, 15min in the day, or how many hours in the week always taking the nearest murrey number to the answer, most of the stuff I read seems to use a broad brush of the number 64, I have no problem with that, just try it out until the chart makes sense to you

--- 帖子 #192 ---
If a trader finds another pair with a good setup that is not on my watch list by all means speak up.

I'm willing to trade just about any instrument not only the 10 I'm currently watching.

UJ is an outside chance but I'd need to see it rise about 70 pips before I looked at it so not that likely at the moment.

Market rather quiet at present.

Not bad, and H4 looks good too.

Only reluctance is weak currency strength at the moment. However I am not sure if this makes a huge amount of difference if you intend to keep the trade for the longer term, and put in your stops. However I would potentially wait for more momentum.

AUDUSD looks in a good position as well, and has a strong currency strength for buy as seen below.

Exactly right!

The pair is that weak currently that making an entry could mean being in it for a longer period of time and certainly not ideal.

Basically it does not fit the general criteria of being a good trade (does not mean it wouldn't go to TP though but the journey might be chaotic.

Leave it alone would be my call unless some positive PA takes hold of it.

There is a chance it does not hit the 8/8.. and it decides to go down after hitting the 7/8 mark... right?

What will be the deciding factor that would mean you enter a sell trade from the 7/8 going down to possibly 5/8 - top of trading range..?

Basically, when do you know when to wait for it to hit the 8/8 or when do you decide to sell after it hit's the 7/8..?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
One technique I'll be looking to apply under the right conditions is to lock in profit at say BE + next level but only after price has moved to the 2nd level.

For example, if I shorted EU at +1/8 I'd move the stop to 8/8 once price hits 7/8.

This approach will work fine on a teending pair to the downside without whipsaw activity.

Ony problem is no-one knows how the PA will trace out over time.

But if I have 1 level of profit locked in I'm not going to be too disappointed.

The MML has plenty of literature on this however I would say that any trade taken away from the extremes will have a higher degree of risk attached to it.

I have been looking at taking trades in the internal structure of the MML because I'm a PA trader so I see opportunity.

I would look for a push up to the level (for example taking a short) and a rejection and a transfer of strength to the bears however I would apply a much tighter stop than at the extemities due to the perceived higher trading risk.

An alternative is to enter under ideal conditions as stated above but to trade in the UP direction when above 4/8 and in the down direction when below the 4/8.

There are multiple options to this and the chart structure is something I would analyse thoroughly ... the trade could still lose though but I'd be willing to accept that if I made the entry.

When I take an internal MML trade I will do my best to explain my entry criteria and thought process (whether the trade ends up hitting TP or not).

I tend to also look for reasons why the trade should not be entered and if I cannot find any reason then I may enter the trade if there is some minor doubt what I do is reduce the risk by applying both a smaller stop and definitely a smaller lot size.

Discretionary entries are sure to enter the traders arena so sometimes the trader has to come up with reasons to enter or not to enter above and beyond any rules.

Rules are simply a general guideline and they do not apply to all situations ... not even close.

Observe how price has been pushing up with a number of pullbacks.

Do you really think its ideal to short from 7/8 under current conditions?

There is some minor rejection at the 7/8 level but not enough to convince me to short it.

I would want to see a big rotation type candle similar to a bearish engulfing candle before I got interested.

I would not even be interested unless some serious bear strength enters the chart then I'll reassess.

To top it off the PA is currently at a snails pace which is another reason to avoid it.

If you really wanted to short this pair then place your stop about 5 pips above the recent high and a TP no deeper than the next level down @ 6/8.

Very often price makes a move back to test the DO line but no guarantees this will occur.

ps. increased bearish intent and stronger momentum to the downside then reassess forsure.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Didn't really get to trade today bc of school, so kind of just watching price at the moment. I think something important to note, especially for those scalping lower time frames like myself, is to be careful when your 1 minute trades are not in the direction of the 5 and 15 minute trades. You decrease profitability like that as shown on this potential EURUSD trade. The M1 is at the -1/8 level but hardly bounces because as you can see the 15 minute is not near any significant level to bounce off of.

I'm usually not an advocate for trading with the daily since I don't believe that provides any advantage for minute 1 trading, but if your M1 trades are against the 5 and 15 minute trades, you are likely just trading a retracement that probably won't produce as much profit as fast. The best M1 trades either trade back into the direction of the 5 and 15, or are in line with the 5 and 15 minute levels, meaning all the time frames are signalling a bounce. While these are a lot less trade set ups, you really want to avoid those trades that burst right through your level, and continue with the higher trend.

At this stage I'd use the following but there are many other combinations.

I would also check the instrument its TF and the PA across the chart to make sure the levels actually make some sense.

Note at this stage all with settings of 64 but this can be altered to other Murrey Math alternatives if desired and if suitable:

All with P=64 (I may seek alternatives at a later stage but 64 provides good enough levels for me)

M1; 60 and 240

M5; 60 and 240

M15; 240

M30; 240

H1; 240 and 1440

H4; 1440 and 7200

D1; 7200 and 28800

Recall that:

1. 60 minutes in H1

2. 240 minutes in H4 (4*H1)

3. 1440 minutes in D1 (8*H4)

4. 7200 minutes in W1 (5*D1)

5. 28800 minutes in MN (4*W1)

6. HTF's calculated in a similar manner.

On a given MMPeriod value such as 1440 you can always drop the charts TF down low to observe more of the PA but remember that although the MML gaps will be identical the stops that you apply on a smaller TF may not be appropriate on such a wide gap.

If however, you are able to get into a good trade with a small SL when using the higher MMPeriod settings then keep going because your reward to risk ratio is going to be outstanding.

Hint 1: Usually a smaller TF applies smaller stops and smaller TPs and a higher TF larger stops and larger TPs, the choice is always the traders!

Hint 2: To be in and out of trades on the same day trade with M1, M5 and M15 as any higher TF may have your trades running into the next day!

ps. although I have given some values above please be aware that there are an enormous amount of variations and the sky is the limit meaning at the end of the day a trader needs to find a TF, a P setting and a MMPeriod that they feel comfortable trading since some traders like smaller scalping type trades with small TPs and other traders like larger TPs that play out over more than a day.

Hope this was of some use to you.

Have you got yourself sorted out?

Please refer to the above post for additional information.

It is advisable to apply different MMPeriod settings in the MML indicator but keep P=64 constant.

This will soon show you how the gaps created between MML octaves change on your chart.

I am currently only trading on an M15 TF with P=64 and MMPeriod=240.

By having MMPeriod set=240 what this does is gives me the same levels as a H4 chart.

By leaving the indicator settings unchanged as above I can simply change the TF say to M5 and see plenty more PA or drop to M1 near key reversal or engagement MML levels to fine tune the entry.

If you are trading on a H1 Chart then I would apply P=64, MMPeriod=240 or 1440 so throw these settings on your chart and see which ones you feel comfortable trading. On H1 though your trades are likely to run for more than a day in general based in part on your TP level.

Hi Masterrmind,

Long time since we chatted . The level will change if something changed in the lookback period as it is a repainting indicator - so if the highs or lows were different then it will redraw I think. I use it on the 240 setting also and mainly look at the T15 with the odd T! and T5 check. I am using the Murray Math 1 indicator (not the one that prints the info top left of chart - and it has no baby lines either).

I also have instance that I use the on the weekly setting (10080) and have it on a daily chart which is nice for my longer term trades. Yesterdays EU was a very good example of the shorter term trade setup.. Let me know if you want more info on MM and will send it for you.

All the best

Yes I just thought the MML would reset after extremes have been breached.

However, as you say I also believe it is the period that caused it.

GA my chart DRL = -2/8!

-2/8 turn round?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Apply the following:

MMPeriod (default = 1440 but I use 240)

* 60 for hourly pivots,

* 1440 for daily pivots,

* 10080 for weekly and

* 43200 for monthly.

If the setting is greater than 0 then the indicator will apply a P value of MMPeriod (minutes) to calculate all the MMLs.

If set = 0, then the indicator will use the P value of the current TF of the applied chart and calculate all the MMLs.

NB. I also use different values for the W1 and MN but each to their own ... the chart structure has much to say about the choice IMHO.

Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Yes I've been observing GA most of the day.

However it lacks the high probability component (no real momentum to the upside and basically ranging over the level b/w 500 to 700).

Chart structural view it looks good for a long.

78.6 Fib of the main leg is also a favorite of mine.

I'll keep a close watch on it and if price makes its way back down say 15-20 pips to the lower level again then I'll look for a long since this will get me into the trade at a better price.

Until then I'm observing only.

Hi Mastermind,

For me the 1.60000 is more significant as a turning point.

Trading from (-1) (-2) (+1) (+2) Levels from H1 and above and Trading from those Levels on M15 and M5 increases chances of success greatly.

Particularly when used in conjunction with Market Structure, RN and PA.

At the moment more Orders are being Accumulated around the 1.6050 Half Number.

We don't know yet if the Accumulation is to go Long or to continue down to the 1.60000 RN.

Pending order @ 1 lot now deleted.

New Buy Limit @ 0.5 lots (identical values) has been set.

PA is rather rangy (tight) at the moment suggesting market direction is uncertain.

Note 1: The blue rectangle below pending order is there as a visual reference that if price hits it I'll drop to an M1 TF and seek to exit the trade.

Note 2: Just because the SL is placed right down at the next level does not mean I will eat that much of a loss ... certainly will not.

hi what's the use of symbol changer indicator?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
The option is there to cancel the pending order if its not triggered in the next few hours.

A smaller lot size is now applied with a cancellation of the first pending order but a long trade will still be sought.

Based on the direction that price takes after the order is active in the market then an earlier manual closure may be made just under the blue rectangle shown on my screenshot above.

If the trade is closed out prematurely then ther is always the option to re-enter at an even lower level.

Time will tell how this unfolds but I'm still willing to take on a reduced risk at the 50 level since it still represents a reasonable opportunity to get into the long side.

ps. these MML gaps on GA are nice too @ just a touch over 60 pips so to get 2 levels would be super nice!

Yesterday's trade.. on the AUDUSD.

Initiated trade at 1533hrs BUY, based on the currency strength of AUD, weakness of USD

Breaching the 1/8. Positive movementon H4 chart as well. This was a mistake, as price lowered, but thankfully it rallied on open on AUD markets.

I placed a TP at 2/8, which price tested, but did not want to reach. Before it has now dropped down to 1/8 area.

I was lucky and certainly a poor trade I would not want to do again.. Captured 19+ pips

I think what I did wrong was I should have waited for clear move from the 0/8 to the 1/8 for certain. Anyone else see where I went wrong?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
USDCHF M15 - MMP=240.... Another to keep an eye on. Currency strength is good for dollar and low for franc. It's bounched off the +1/8 and looks to test the level again.

On the daily with MMP=1440 price bar has just breached the 6/8 level. Could this head down towards the 5/8ths??

--- 帖子 #260 ---
We certainly do.

At least all my trades are on display putting me in the spotlight.

But that's more than ok with me.

My contribution is my preaching all over this board. Get small! I have a five figure account, and I trade pennies!

Something we learned in the Similarity Project a few years ago is that price will return to any point within 90 trading days. If you trade small, you can ride out any DD. Pennies add up. Sure, I can trade 2 standard lots, but why? I will just vacuum up the pennies on the floor. It is safer, and it is stress free.

Mean Reversion is a wonderful thing so long as a healthy margin% is maintained throughout the Ups and Downs.

The objectives of the trader are key here.

Some traders might be happy to trade 0.01 lots and let the trade stay open for months.

However, to some traders this would drive them crazy.

We are each painted with a different brush afterall and what suits one trader may not suit another.

Initially when learning to trade I tend to think that trading low lots on a largish account (relatively speaking) is the way to go.

Seasoned traders are free to apply whatever style floats his/her boat.

Long term consistency should be the goal of any trader ... lets just hope the consistency is for profit and not for donating to the market.

My chart is showing something completely different.... I've got to admit it's quite confusion. Everyone has different settings and suggestions, I just want something that works with the correct murrey levels on the various TF's..

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Your chart will show something different if you are in a different time zone. Murrey Math is not a magic bullet. It displays a grid that that some believe has specific properties. It tends to work because you are buying low and selling high, and your reward is potentially 7/8ths times your risk. Even if you clip your trades to have 2/8ths, you are still positive in the traders equation because you rish 1/8th to get 2/8ths. Do not stress about the numbers, look at what you see on your chart and trade that.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Thanks, makes sense then with time zones. Yea I suppose I need to stop blaming the indicators and spend more time looking at the patterns and fundamentals. Thank you

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I do not consider you blaming the indicators, if you need the lines, follow what they tell you to do. Xard777 has a nice MM grid for dummies. Just follow the yellow brick road.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Just to echo what jmn5611 says, I have kept with my original MM coded by xard, just think of it as a picture frame and you want it to include a certain number of days that include the Octave that catches the high and low, with the one I have I just set the beginner to 0 and the periodtake to what ever number I want to see as back data, so all I have to do is change 1 number hence 256 trading days in a year, or 128 hour in a week etc, so its up to you to tailor it to your own style and timeframe you want to trade from you could even look at 1024 (mm number) on a 5min chart, then you get a weeks view of price action, its really as jmn says its for dummies but it helps and works

Before this thread I used to scalp trendline with confluence of Support and Resistance and pivots. That was a very powerful strategy, and high probability confluence set ups with trend lines resulted with fast and very profitable trades. Seeing as how profitable the Murray Lines can be I imagine combining them with trendlines would be good too. The upside to this is that I only check every couple hours to see how close to the trendline price is, see if there are any levels close to the trendline and set my price alerts. The downside is that there aren't as many set ups. But if you are like me and don't want to spend so much time checking for set ups, this might be of use.

When a trendline is in confluence with a key level of support/resistance, pivot, etc, it will produce a faster move. If you look at the screenshots posted, the bounces from the Murray Lines that were in confluence with the trendline bounced the strongest and actually had a decent move. You might notice that when price bounces in confluence with the trendline it is much stronger than without confluence with the trendline as you can see by the screenshot where price hit the 4/8 level previous but did not move as fast and strong as with the trend line during the later move.

The first picture shows bounces where the first is less than 5 pips off of the 6/8, the 0/8 and 4/8 levels are dead on with the trendline. The second shows trendlines for the 1 hour chart.

No doubt trendlines can be very useful.

I tend to use them as a guide in the first place and then certainly check for confluence of other trading factors.

The trendline hour setting you apply appears to be 24 hours.

On my M15 chart I'm setting 72 hours (3 days) but there are multiple possible combinations.

Any idea that adds to the possibility of more profitable trading is always a great idea.

I also want to start looking into trading the M1 TF looking for smaller TP trades that originate out of the Asian session.

Asian session: M1 and M5 mostly

Note: Do not put all your faith in a turning point based purely on trendlines as this is a potential recipe for disaster as breaks of TLs are frequent.

I have not forgotten about it.

Its decided to hit the sleep mode so no immediate trade likely at this stage which is typical for this commodity in the Asian session, the NY session may yield a better entry or even London but lets wait and see.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I will also be looking for setups as follows:

Where the mid T/L intersects an MML level in the sequential direction of the MML grid and the 72 hour trend.

For example,

In the GBPNZD screenshot the 72 hour trend is UP, the next MML sequence is from 7/8 to 8/8 and a bounce off the mid T/L.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

By understanding that such an entry carries additional risk the lot applied will be lower than normal and the SL will be tighter as shown.

It goes without saying that a trader needs to be familar with the instrument they plan to trade and to be aware of the time of entry factors (is high impact news coming, is Frankfurt, London or NY about to open )think about increased volatility and how this might affect yout trade especially your SL placement).

Be aware that when price breaks through the trendline the indicator will repaint at the lower (or higher) level.

This is perhaps ok provided you are aware of it.

Chart now looks like the following:

Note: Higher trendline hour settings will now be investigated.

EJ [5 day=120 hour setting]

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

120 setting produces an upward trending channel but the most recent low for the day is still being used as the lower trendline bound (thats fine).

Note 1: Trendline hour setting is then to be of a discretionary nature and to be set by traders choice.

Note 2: If GN is changed to a 120 hour setting in the trendline indi the mid trendline moves far away leaving the entry rather vulnerable ... hmmm

This is despite an upwards trend in the last day, I think accordint to the MML it's reaching it's maximum and PA is sidewards...

Hi, can I ask you have you a polite question, have you looked at these 2 pairs in any other timeframe a part from 15 min ?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Okay... I don't know what's going on here, but my MML's have now re-drawn on EURNZD and on M15, shows price at 5/8ths...

As for AUDUSD, H4 shows price at -1/8 for me. the only issue is Daily shows price between 3/8 and 4/8ths in the normal trading range..

This is definitely a head scratcher to know if my lines are even correct or not.....

AU [Quantum with MML] Update

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

EA Advisor logic design to be added to QLT v1.6.1

Start Trading Quantum cycle if

1. Allow trading if current price <=[0/8]P && >=[-2/8]P based on MML indicator user input settings eg P=64, MMP=240 (EA gets indi settings)

2. SL placement: Set Trade #1,2,3,...N SL = [-2/8]P - MML Gap, [-2/8]P-MML Gap-5 pips, [-2/8]P-MML Gap-10 pips,... etc]

3. TP placement: @ [1/8]P, [2/8]P, .... etc and with or without trailing logic.

4. Allow trading if current price >=[8/8]P && <=[+2/8]P based on MML indicator user input settings eg P=64, MMP=240 (EA gets indi settings)

5. SL placement: Set Trade #1,2,3,...N SL = [+2/8]P + MML Gap, [+2/8]P+MML Gap+5 pips, [+2/8]P+MML Gap+10 pips,... etc]

6. TP placement: @ [7/8]P, [6/8]P, .... etc and with or without trailing logic.

What to do if in a Q cycle and the MML resets?

EA must not change settings for levels once applied (at user discretion).

Let it run its course and use manual over-ride to close some trades or the cycle if necessary to preserve the trading account.

Important: The Quantum depth entry value would need to be entered and in the AU cycle shown as an example I fitted a Q = 2000 such that the 1st entry via Quantum EA would be inside the Trade Zone. The EA would need to 'find' an appropriate Q value once current price drops inside the Trade Zone and then continue to make entries based on this Q value and only taking longs at the bottom of the MML Grid and only shorts from the top.

Perhaps something to think about although the idea can be expanded upon the basic design is rather simple.

Personally I would prefer to trade this on larger TFs with M15 being the smallest most likely use H1 and H4 and allow the cycles small lot sequence and to simply play out in the background while I trade manually on other TFs.

Something to think about.

Impact on AU M15 Chart as MML level -2/8 was breached causing a reset.

The reset has now placed what was the -2/8 level @ 2/8 level a jump up the order of 4 MML levels.

Not sure I like this outcome but I understand why it does it based on the period.

Current long was entered @ MML -2/8.

After reset its @ MML 2/8

I'm afraid the Murrey ideology is starting to show its faults.

I see that the PA across the chart is more important than any Murrey line because once they change they are actually presenting the trader with another different and distinct set of rules of engagement.

Its as simple as this:

1. Consider the trade entry criteria for a MML = -2/8

2. Now consider an entry for a MML = 2/8

All that occurred was a small breakout below the lows of the -2/8 MML.

And all of a sudden I am supposed to re-analyze the exact identical price level under different MML criteria because the MML label has changed.

Comments about this would be most welcome but sorry to say I am seeing multiple flaws in the approach.

Hi Masterrmind

Please advise what TF and settings for MML n Quantum applied to compile this watchlist?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #346 ---
The watchlist is simply what comes out of the MML Dashboard with Periods = 64 and TF=H4 close to the time of posting.

I have 3 dashboards in operation which show as follows at this particular time:

Dash A
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dash B
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dash C
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Basically once the MML dash shows an instrument closer to the extremes such as -+1/8 or -+2/8 then its perhaps time to take a look at the chart and check for the PA.

No trade should ever be taken blindly ofcourse so its not an invitation to open in the direction stated just to make us aware of these levels and to take the next step by assessing each instrument on their individual merits to trade or not to trade.

Hope that helps.

Great analysis, Masterrmind!

Unfortunately, the mtfRSI indicator did not confirm other minima to the right of the entry point.

Now there is only one order for the buy.

Quantum for Entry = 80

Quantum for Close = 260

P_Murrey = 128

Hi Mastermind,

It was the re-setting that pushed me into dropping them and eventually using the .500 / .800 /.000 /.200 numbers, because they are constant, and Market Structure.

I found it better to use the (-1/8) (-2/8) (+1/8) (+2/8) on the H1 and above TFs and Trade those Levels on the Lower TFs.

All I was essentially doing was to Trade the Extremes of the Higher TFs.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I had a very quick look at them many many years ago and went a different route in the end.

I've been aggressively studying them here though and some of their shortcomings are starting to come to light.

The reason I've opened the can of worms with my comments is not to start a war of words but rather to see what others have to say about the re-aligning issues with the MMLs and how they trade around them.

I may look at chart structure on the higher TFs and simply match a period for the MMLs ie consider higher TF significant highs and lows and structure the octaves in and around them with obviously smaller TF entries being applied.

I'm interested to hear what MML practitioners have to say.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I would not say having doubts although it perhaps comes across that way and certainly any method has its limitations.

Its more about seeking from MML practitioners how they handle a trade that they entered at the extreme levels especially +-2/8 when a small break of the extreme occurs causing the MML indicator to reset all the lines.

I want to know how they look at this issue and that's all.

ps. I understand the Quantum concept comprehensively but I'll wait to get into that discussion if in fact I do.

I may be way off the mark but this is how I view the chart shift , I view them as being 2 moving averages , if you put enough data on your chart you will capture the last chart shift , if its down that tells me the bigger trend is down and I should be selling any rallies, (pullback in a trend) if we get back up to +2/8 we are back to the original chart shift hence are we going to see the trend resume back in the original, the only problem in not seeing this thought clear is, Murrey/Gann use a Perfect square of Time & Price and that's what is missing from our charts, therefore what position ( Octave line) price enters the next new Octave of Time governs the next Octave of Price, I will leave it there as you can see I am struggling with the right words to explain but if you did look at that site I showed yesterday clicked on screenshots then the continue button it walks you through

This chart might help with what I am trying to say, its my normal 1 min but to try and explain a little better I have added a CCI set to 1024 (same as our Murrey Grid) to act as a prime trend then another CCI 8 to pick up on the price move movement between the line giving a clue to OB/OS, so it represents the same as 2 Murrey grids one set inside another, well that's the idea. ps the white line is now the 8am London Open

Hi Genry05,

Further to the other comment I think it would be far easier to simply setup a Murrey Grid Option as follows:

Have the logic coded into the QLT v1.6.1 EA as an added trading operation for example:

Trade_MML_Grid = True/False [Allow MML grid trading to occur or not]

Apply_Q_Murrey = True/False [Allow trades to be opened by Quantum method or not; If False use simple Grid only]

Variable

1. P_MML

2. TF_MML

3. StepBack

4. MML_Start_Time

5. MML_Stop_Time

6. QDE_MML

7. QDC_MML

8. Max_MML_Trades

9. MML_Start_Lot

10. MML_Stop_Lot

11. MML_Lot_Increment

12. MML_Trade_Spacing

13. MML_Start_Level

14. MML_Stop_Level

A simple grid however could be applied as a script dragged to the chart with options to only open maximum orders or set pending maximum orders (Buy or Sell Limit orders) spaced out evenly between the 2 Murrey levels (as set by the user eg 0/8 to -2/8 or 8/8 to +2/8 or other preferred Murrey levels) with lot size choice, lot multiplier (or incremental increase) as per user settings.

Functionality to include SL placement (staggered = 2 trades DO NOT have the same SL price) and TP at a user input MML level eg 4/8 or close by reverse Quantum value.

The grid appied without Quantum will provide a known maximum number of trades within the Murrey Trade Zone and if price drops either below the -2/8 level or above the +2/8 level then no more entries are executed by the EA or script.

The logic could be coded into your Staxis version EA or as a separate script.

Something to think about at least.

Yes, these ideas are gradually embodied in the adviser. Currently, the PivotEnvelopes indicator is developed and built-in.

I think the time will come and the Murray levels.

In my own version of the Expert Advisor, several more levels are used.

If these levels include everything at once, then they allow the expert to work in a volume of 0.2-0.5 on the account to $ 1000.

But transactions for the year 20-40 total profit of 2000-4000 $ on the initial $ 1000.

Do you draw your own S/R lines or is that an indi?

I'm enjoying your posts. I can't trade whilst on work days due to long hours, so enjoying your posts to follow your trades and see your thought process going into trades. Helps me massively out and I'm sure others too.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Thanks for the compliments.

If you are referring to the thick horizontal white line this is simply a plot of the Daily Open (DO line).

The DO line is a typical bounce zone in any session but perhaps more so in the Asian session.

You will find that on some trades I will close out at the DO line, seek to protect the trade by reducing the SL or wait for price to move away and then nail an entry either long or short.

A lot has to do with the instrument being traded, the proximity to major market opens and the all important PA.

ps. The spread is too high on a number of pairs on this broker but its a demo account so I'm not too worried. On a live account seek low spread ECN.

pps. However, when trading ranges are super low like in the Asian session you need to realise what impact a high spread has on your trade both from an entry technique point of view and certainly profit (if it was real).

ppps. Look at the GN short earlier today now look at the entry level ... if it was EU deduct about 6 pips making the entry higher up the chart ... big difference.

Hi xard777, could not help noticing you have popped in to see what we are up to with MurreyMaths, when I met Mr Murrey he had a Real-Time version under Beta Test but admitted he was having problems with bugs etc and to my knowledge it was never released, I spotted when I was researching, your version that as served me well, thank you, but noticed you had a crack at producing the Circles of Conflict, Speed and Time lines etc how did that end up because I think MT4 did an update and stopped it working, have you any plans to have another crack at , I do hope so

I can see after 2 weeks that MML set 128-H4 very risky,and no good reverse point.

Next week I use only 1440 DAILY settings, and moore filter Quantum Stochtastic OB-OS

--- 帖子 #396 ---
How I break the Murrey 4 day charts down into a 5 min, 1440mins x 4days = 5760 then divide by 5min = 1152 so I use a Murrey 1152 on a 5min chart which with enough data lets me see a bigger picture with a tradable octave, to me there is more than one set of numbers to use Murrey with you just have to use a set that makes sense to you and the risk/reward that you are comfortable with

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I've been super busy refreshing my memory by reading over Gann and Murrey material.

Most of Murrey's material revolves around the D1 candles.

The circles of conflict and creating the Trading Frame are rather simple once read a few times.

Creating a quarter of a years data meaning 13 weeks and then using 64 D1 candles (funny how 13 weeks*5days is 65 not 64, but I get it)

I believe the creation of these circles at the intersections of the even octaves is also very simple in theory.

The main issue might be in MT4 scaling of time with price.

Draw a circle on an MT4 chart as best you can and then alter the price scale ... obviously the circle will become an ellipse and things become distorted.

I'm not sure how far coders have progressed in attempting to create these circles of conflict within the Trading Frame but from a geometrical perspective it is really simple.

The angles given are simple intersections of connecting lines based on octave points at crossings.

The distortion of time to price issue will also greatly affect the angles meaning that the MML speed lines will also distort.

I've read quite a few of your earlier posts and notice that you are a keen student of MML.

Do you know how far coders have been able to progress?

ps. I will also be asking the Op if the use of Gann analysis is permitted in this thread because I want to apply a correct Gann Fan to the trading and drive it up a notch.

Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Xard777 seemed to be on a mission to code a realtime version but it all seem to come to a sudden stop when MT4 did an upgrade, you are quite correct the Daily candle and End of Day software was what Murrey advertised, it was only after I found Xard777 realtime version did I go in pursuit of trying to find a way of trading it realtime that's why I have to use numbers and timeframes that make some sense to me, its been a lonely road never found anyone that traded it live that I thought was coming up with anything better than me, hence I always broke his Daily numbers 4,8,16,32,64,128,256 etc down to a more acceptable risk/reward trading style, were price fitted the octave

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Great minds........

This is a fully developed Murrey chart with the circles of conflict. Murrey used them to help him keep his charts square. Gann material was not meant for digital screens. So an ellipse is a dead giveaway that your chart are not in the correct perspective. The downside to this is that on a fully developed chart you have to put the Gann angles and circles in manually. On each symbol.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Been busy with school and all so sorry for not keeping up with trades and contributing as much as before. In my spare time however I've been trying to think of strategies for MML. One of these is hedging with options. I know a lot of people stray from options in forex but I know Nadex offers a platform that makes this a little more legitimate. They way options work is that the option you buy has a price at that point based on risk, factoring time of expiration and how close to "In the Money" or "Out of the Money" it is. Since you can't lose more than you put in, this offers an opportunity for hedging.

Meaning, we KNOW for a fact that there is increased volatility at the +2/8 and +1/8 levels, but we don't always know if it will be broken or turn, we just know there is a big move there. What I'm trying to figure out is how to profit from this increased volatility without taking risk.

Let's say there are 2 options available  when price is at a +1/8th line. Both are priced at let's say $30 and expire in an hour for $100. Price must move 10 pips to get the full payout. Well since you can close your options before they expire to keep profit, basically price would need to move enough so one of the options exceeds $60, to cover the price of the other.

So price would reverse, option 1 would be worth lets say $70, you lose option 2, so you are left with $10 profit., since the most you can lose is $30 from the first option. Of course this increases with the amount of options you buy, and these numbers will vary.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Thanks for the response.

Although I was aking for coding progress at the end of the day I prefer to take the manual approach so I can see how it all fits together.

The following is a little brain teaser (not really) but lets see who is able to answer it correctly.

=============================================================================================

Who can correctly answer the following questions?

Here is a chart of the EURUSD D1 TF.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The zone of interest is shown by the rectangle housing 16 completed D1 candles from Jan 3 to Jan 24, 2017.

High price @ 1.07748

Low price @ 1.03402

Questions are as follows:

Assuming the Murrey Math approach.

1. What is the correct time scale?

2. What is the correct price scale?

3. Applying 1 price scale to 1 time scale, what is the number of minutes and number of pips (or points) on EU D1 for a 1:1 price to time scale?

4. What is the correct MML Speed angle from the low left to the high right (candle 1 to 16)?

5*. How would you correctly design a 1x1 price to time Gann box on this D1 chart that shows a correct 45 degree angle?

Enjoy the rest of your weekend,

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Here is picture of a correctly drawn Gann chart. Do not use the mt4 Gann angle tool if you want geometric precision. They have to be drawn by hand.

Edit, Masterrmind I did have to move the 1/24 date back two days to achieve a square of 16 trading days and the geometric harmony.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
The MT4 Gann tool is highly sensitive to scaling and so it changes as soon as the price axis (or any axis) is altered.

It can be drawn by hand as you say using the trendline angle tool or by using the Fib tool but you will need to convert the angles by re-calculating all the 9 Gann angles.

Since both sides of the Gann Fan are symmetrical about the 1x1 line you will only need to make 1 fan and it can be used for L-H or H-L PA.

Any reason your chart is showing only 3 Gann angles per fan instead of the standard 9 (less clutter perhaps?).

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Yes, less clutter, those are the most important angles to watch. Do you see how price reacts to them?

Another reason is that it is less laborious.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I'm not sure what advantage if any the circles of conflict would have so I might leave them alone and in any case I have noticed an enormous amount of inaccuracies in even how Murrey applied them. Only need to look at his work in some form of detail and you'll notice it ... some circles flatter than others, poor alignment and overlap too and other matters I need not address here.

Another aspect might be the poor drawing quality of computers back in the 90's quite abit different from what we have nowadays.

In any case I've setup multiple Trade Frames (16, 32 and 64) with Circles of Conflict in MT5 so I'll look at progressing that in the background.

If it appears to be of no added benefit I'll archive it.

My feeling though is that they are probably not needed for an experienced trader who can read PA at a high level.

As for the MML Speed lines and MML momentum lines I'll dig a bit deeper into them although getting the angle correct on the chart is key.

A trader with a good eye can gauge the speed and momentum and in any case there are informative indicators around that can calculate them.

At the end of the day keeping things relatively simple is important provided some decent trades are being made and the account grows positively.

Good trading,

You are clearly smarter than the average bear.

Fact is, Murrey fans and Gann fans do not get along at all. The main reason is that Murrey took a very small segment of Gann and built a whole system from it.

But I have seen based on your query that you are competent in Gann theory. You chose the highest high and lowest low in a specific time period. That is how Gann squared his charts. The circles of conflict are just markers to be aware of. Ultimately PA rules.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I won't tell you which side of the fence I stand but it does start with G.... (oops!).

Nevertheless, only an ignorant trader would side with one over the other and not at least study some of the others material.

The thread Op in this case is only applying a basic skeleton of the Murrey method and what is it really 12 lines separated by an octave gap determined in part by a period and simply looking to go short off the highs and long off the lows with a Quantum cycle thrown in for good measure.

Perhaps I'll limit the technical questions and posts on Gann and Murrey and simply trade those MML lines (or whatever you like to call them).

It really is looking for a good entry to short once price has been charging up high or looking to go long when price has been charging down low.

What I might do next however, is to define some of these MML lines based on the chart structure that I see.

ps. And the thread OP is doing just fine up to this point.

Bring on Monday!

Mastermind, jmn5611, great work guys, I have Murrey's  manuals and workbooks, not an easy read for me, you guys would have no problem though, Murrey sets all his Octaves from October 7th, the speed angles are

11 degrees  slowest reverse angle

22 degrees  normal speed

33 degrees faster reversals

45 degrees Best support/Resistance  Normal for Indexes, faster reversals

56 degrees faster reversal

67 degrees fast reversals

78 degrees faster reverse angle

he really only uses 22, 45 and 78

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Question:

Does he describe how to determine the speed angle on a currency pair?

For a given currency pair we need the appropriate price to time scale which I think is determined once the MML lines are placed correctly on both the time and price axis ... then its clear to see 1 price unit to 1 time unit.

Given this information then we can draw up the Trading Frame (using choice of 4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512, etc etc).

The constructed Trading Frame will then have an MML axis (-2/8 to +2/8 etc) along the price axis and an MML axis (0/8, 1/8, ... 0/7, 0/8 etc) along the time axis.

Then draw the vertical and horizontal MMLs (which will clearly intersect at 90 deg)

The small squares that get created will lead directly to all correct speed angles based on rise over run (tangent).

Therefore it is crucial to understand where to construct the Trading Frame with respect to the time axis.

This is because the MM method does not care about historical information but is more focused on level that price enters the Trading frame and then segments of a 16 trading day PA.

The Trading Frame should be set off the 1st frost every month ??? [Really ... please explain this concept]

I'm again assuming that the start date would be a progression from the Oct 7 start date.

If a D1 chart was being traded would the first Trading Frame vertical line start exactly at Oct 7 or the next trading day once Oct 7 has closed.

Question:

What date does the first frost occur on a given month?

Does a trader need to keep updated about this 'frost' and then quickly update the Trading frame?

Note 1: Once the x and y axis are plotted with the right MMLs then it would be very easy to for example when price rose 7/8ths in 5/8ths in time.

Note 2: Key is to know where price enters the Trading Frame when it gets reset presumably on the 1st frost of each month (hmmm).

ps. How cool would it be to have an indicator that you can join a line from H-L or L-h anywhere on the chart and it will give you the angle it makes with the horizontal namely the speed angle.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #410 ---
What would really be useful would be if someone could post a screenshot of say the EURUSD D1 Chart showing the correct axis overlay of the MMLs for price and time.

Perhaps use 16 or 32 at the most to make the construction a little easier and so it all fits on the screen so that the scaling does not screw with it.

ps. Actually probably just the y axis (price) MMLs (+2/8 down to -2/8) is required.

ps. the Trading Frame might need to have different MML applied since most of the PA is running through the top half of the Trading Frame.

pps. Yes exactly! And then if price touches the +2/8 line then the next Trading Frame will shift up 4 octaves from its current position ... correct?

ppps. Notice the pivot central of the Trading Frame ... now look how PA reacted to it! ... I've seen this on multiple charts today ... interesting.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Thanks but I have that one and a much larger version.

This following screenshot shows the relative speed angles.

Attached Image

The lines all originate from the bottom left hand corner of the Trading Frame and project up and to the right.

What happens if PA entered your Trading Frame halfway up the speed angles would be inconclusive (or incorrect) in my view.

I still think that its relative meaning take a section of the PA and determine how many price units the instrument rose per units of time.

How about going to Insert > Cycle lines.

This little tool will allow you to start at a given date and then all you do is drag it to the right 4 days and it will apply a series of vertical lines at every 4 day increment.

Hopefully that's what you are after.

There is controversy over the start time. In Murrey original work, he used his birthday, 10/7. Later he changed that to the harvest moon, which is still in October. Gann suggested a significant high or low, such as last years high or low.

S/R = 1.5625

Major Octave = 0.19531

Minor Octave = 0.02441

Baby Octave = 0.00305

How to calculate a 45 ° angle :

4h chart : we calculate a square with one side = Minor Octave and other side = 64 candles

So the diagonal makes a 45 angle .

We start square on a lowest low ,or an highest high .

I can't speak for the thread Op but any information that assists in creating a clearer chart is helpful.

I'll look into it.

The other issue I potentially see (not yet confirmed) is not so much in having a correct Trading Frame drawn on MT4 but more so on having the current Trading Frame always captured inside the MT4 chart meaning that no scrolling is required to keep all the Trading Frame borders in view.

Renko with MML .... now there is an interesting idea (might need its own thread though).

ps. I'm also looking into other trading platforms such as cTrader/cAlgo/Ninja Trader among others to compare visual abilities of their platforms.

Murrey does make a mention and shows a few charts with a 4,16,32,and 64 m/avg added but it is indeed only brief

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I also read that the yearly Trading Frame resets on the same date that US Treasury Bonds get auctioned in the first week of October.

Considering that the MML levels are determined in a progressive that is to say forward direction it makes me wonder if these MML indicators are calculating the lines correctly or incorrectly since I think they consider x_periods back from the current bar.

I'll take an indepth look at the calculations being applied in the indicators to see if they are accurate or not.

To test out a method one needs to be applying the correct MML lines.

The article posted above is actually quite a good read as it shows examples of how MML are determined in a host of different instruments including currencies (albeit the Deutchmark back in the day).

An Excel sheet could be builtup to perform the calculations.

The time axis rolling anchor line for the left border of the Trading Frame is also important.

Which stems from having the correct reset date applied back in Oct 2016.

ps. GN looks interesting for a short ... lets see how that pair develops but I won't touch it until it cuts the +1/8 level on M15-64-H4.

Surely someone has an indicator that can draw at least a Trading Frame border (2 vertical lines + 2 horizontal lines) based on:

1. Correct sequencing date from 1st week in October that aligns with the US Treasury Bond Auction date and projected forward;

2. Forward projection of the Trading Frame to suit the TF, P and MMPeriod

Note 1: Point 1 above is to ensure that the 0/8 vertical MML (time axis) aligns with the correct start date. Then based on the user choice of 16,32,64 etc trading days for the Trading Frame this will dictate where the right vertical Trading Frame border aligns.

Question:

What is the correct date to use for the start of the Trading Frame in October, 2016?

I see a few options for this date including an auction date and a settlement date generally a few days later.

Hi another nice trade, well done yet again, here are some of Murrey's quotes from his manuel

There are 2 reasons why the markets want to reverse of a multiple of 4days

1 The earth is set to 3days of magnetism and 1 day of neutrality set off the 1st Frost each fall

2 The S.E.C. requires all trading brokerage houses to return monies after 3 days when a Long or Short Position is executed

We've seen that the SEC is setting its own Harmonic Rhythm inside our Trading Frame, which at extreme highs or lows will run out of liquidity for a few days, so therefore we would expect reverses

So now we have the vertical lines of our square set to the future, we set our first "tee off time" and run forward every 4 working days, when we know that we might see a reverse, we are following as we look forward every 4,8,16,32 or 64 days which equal the number of trading days in each quarter of the U.S. 30 Year Bond market

,Agreed, I to think its wrong would like to see the square set to the nearest auction date to the 7th, Every year Murrey would move the start day by 1day this was so you had to re-new your subs and get a new activation code for his software, I know its a bit silly but would a weatherman know what is classed as the 1st frost in the fall

Update

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I'm finding the MML levels quite good but really these are very similar to Gann levels with the 1/8 divisions.

I am pushing fairly hard to get some of the MML students here to identify the yearly reset date in Oct that is used.

I'm not convinced that its the 6th or 7th Oct 2016.

The MML reversal days occur on the even vertical MML lines according to the literature.

I've constructed a GN D1 Chart (64 Day) with the Trading Frame anchor line set on Oct 7 2016 (last trading day of the week as it turns out) and after cycling it forward 1 by 64 day cycle I've put in the time axis MMLs that range from 0/8 to 0/8.

I tell you that the reversals of trend on the Daily time frame that occur at the even MMLs are very interesting indeed.

The next step for me is to apply this concept over multiple pairs, indices and later stocks and analyze the statistics.

Obviously if the stats show a high occurrence then naturally we would seek to trade in the reveral direction of the D1 candle even if trading lower TFs on such a day.

Trading via Gann strategy requires quite alot more work and the continual updating of the Square in Time so that its accurate is a character building exercise forsure.

At the end of the day its all about gaining some sort of an edge or allowing an interest in a topic to be satisfied.

Onward and upward!

This is the type of action that smells of a snake oil saleman rather than a professional trader.

To be honest when reading through his literature some of the wording is laced with egotism and a sales-like pitch.

For example, he often mentions how other so-called "gurus" think this or do that.

Indirectly in his wording he is clearly saying how great his method is and how bad the other "gurus" method is!

Really?!

At the end of the day who really cares what others are saying and who cares about reading this highly redundant (unecessary) text.

A trader simply wants to focus on the exact trading content (not hear say) and make up their own mind over a given period whether or not it works for them or not.

Here is another short passage taken from his manual "Trading Frame is automatically set off US each year off the 1st frost of each month".

Go figure that out!

ps. Note the above quote is taken from his 1993 version so an up-to-date version might read completely different ... who knows!

Hi Masterrmind, it is a very interesting concept to work on the dates. I am not that familiar with his time date methodology (IE first frost etc). My thought process would be to consider the triple witching dates which are simply the third Friday of March June September and December. As this is when some serious action occurs it may be worthwhile to consider.

But I'm starting to re-think the date ideology.

Instead I'm going to consider the significant highs and lows created in the past and generate Trading Frames from them using 15 horizontal lines comprising 14 equal sectors and 9 vertical lines equally spaced providing 8 sectors.

This new system will be called the "Dynamic PA Frame" or DF for short and I may discuss it and Gann methodology in a new thread.

Until then I'll keep trading along from the MML lines and seek to take profitable trades from the market.

I gather MMperiod is the timeframe but unsure of P? I don't like using/looking at an indicator when I don't know how it's derived.

Secondly, most people seem to be using a different MM indicator but I can only see the original one posted by the OP?

Do i need to place a take profit?

will the system closed automatically?

If there is a TP what is the recommended pips?

HELP!

Hi vgyuszko,

I have quickly implemented a MML TP version. It should take profit around the 4/8 line within the specified distance in Points.

So here it is.

BTW, can you post the actual version of MML you're using ? I've seen somewhere in this forum that the lines differ from an indicator to another... Thanks

Regards

PS: I also attach another version where it takes profit at every single MMLine.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
if you will,than can set the TP in expert.

I use not tp,exit Q/725 or manual

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hi scro!

Good joob!THX

But need more setings!Must set MML P,and MML Period.Everybody use another settings MML.

You do not know so that the levels are TP?(no 4/8 pivot and dist)

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Yes  this is the idea.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Here is an improved version with BE and Trailing Stop.

Also added a function in order that it closes only from a certain distance of the Opening Price so that if it opens near a line it does not close right away.

Thanks for your indicator

In fact every time the high or low touches the channel price (Donchian channel), the QUANTUM squares appear .

Why not use a channel look like "Murrey Math " or your indicator "Murrey Math" look like ???

**READ THIS POST IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE LIMITING RISK WITH MML REVERSALS**

I have been away for this thread for some time but because I am exploring a new platform to trade the MML (this is rnsfrd btw). I think for myself, being a scalper of these lines, I always try to limit my risk as much as possible and maximize on the profit, like any other trader of course. However, being that I use high leverage it becomes increasingly important to pinpoint reversals down to the pip, which is in itself a challenge, and in some cases foolish to even think I could do so.

My main problems with trading the MML is that it is often hard to predict at what level price will turn and how strong the reversal will be. It is hard to set stops and place orders because since these are often high areas of volatility, that stops will get hit, price will reverse earlier than expected, at a higher/lower price than expected, and won't reverse for much profit or will reverse for a lot of profit. The MML combined with price action can give us an that price will react around these lines but where we precisely place trades, stops and profits is often limited.

For example, I could place a trade at the -1/8 line only for it to to go to the -2/8 level, I might be stopped out, or maybe I get nervous and go out of the trade, or maybe it does reverse strongly but I take profit too early. Price does not have a "set" characteristic, it spikes, it has different volatility, there are many variables that go into predicting, trading, and executing a reversal trade. For this reason I decided to look into options. I know options in forex are usually ignored and a grey area but I'll just detail some of the benefits of how options work.

For one, I use Nadex, it's probably the only professional options exchange for forex for US clients, and I know of users who regularly make large deposits and withdrawals without problem.

Options are different because the price of an option is based on probability of a trade being in a certain price range by expiration of that option. I'll just briefly give an example and the benefits of options over traditional forex.

Lets say I see strong price action towards a +1/8 hourly line on EURUSD. The +2/8 line is also close, it is heavily overbought and I know price will reverse. Now, I don't really know where I should buy or place my stops or profit. An alternate option would be to SELL an option that expires in an hour or two hours or 4 hours that says EURUSD will be 20 pips lower than the current price. The option price represents the risk, so a cheap option of $8 might expire in an hour because there is a low chance that price will move 20 pips in an hour. The risk is $8 for this cheap option, and the payout is $92.

Now the catch and the thing most newbies to forex options don't realize is that you can take your profit from the option at any time before expiration.

So in our scenario, lets say I sell an option for $8 saying EURUSD will expire 20 pips lower than the current price. If it is lower than 20 pips then I get my payout of $100 or $92 (Payout Price - Option Price). What are the benefits of this?

1. My risk is limited to $8 and my reward is capped at $92. A risk reward of about 1:11. This is a fixed stop that can be hit multiple times, it can even go past the stop, as long as price reverse at a point past where we bought it, and as long as the price of the option increases then we can make money. You don't have to worry about stops, where it reverses, etc.

2. Increased leverage with decreased risk. The thing about options is that the price of it reflects the underlying market. So the price of $8 represents an 8% chance that the option will expire in the money. As the risk decreases, the price of your option will go up. There are two factors that increase the price of the option. How close it is to expiration and the current price. So if price does drop 20 pips, the price of the option will be approx. $50 if there is a lot of time left and you will make $42 if you plan to sell at that point you can take the profit without waiting for expiry. If the option is about to expire then it will be worth more than $50 probably closer to 90. So you can capitalize way more off of a 20 pip move than if you were to just trade the actual EURUSD pair.

The increased leverage comes from the fact that if I buy a cheap option with a risk of 8, then I can buy 10 "lots" of this option for $80. I essentially am able to trade with $10 a pip with $80, and I cannot lose more than $80. If the price of my $8 option with 10 lots goes to $50, then I make $42 x 10 lots = $420, off of an $80 investment. All without having a stop-loss, a capped risk of 8 pips, and my analysis that a reversal should happen. If I let the trade expire and it is well into profit then I could potentially make $92 x 10 lots = $920 off of an $80 max risk trade. The only risk that you can't control is time. Choosing 5 minute, 1 hour, 2 hour or 4 hours will of course affect the option size.

This works for 5 minute trades as well. The probability of a pair moving 4 - 5 pips in 5 minutes is fairly low. I can get a cheap option for $8 saying price will move 5 pips and sell it back at $50 when it does move. I can make 42 "pips" off a 5 pip move by predicting reversals with MML. If I was to trade straight retail forex, $50 would get me a 5 pip stop and probably not a lot of profit off a 5 minute reversal. In options, $50 can get you a max loss of $50, and an exponentially large return if the market reverses even a few pips. Why? Because the price of the option is related to time. If you can predict a X amount of movement in X amount of time, your return will be exponentially greater than if you were to trade the actual value of the pair.

Ill state this example one more time to show the power of options.

Lets say I see EURUSD shooting up towards a +1/8 line. I know since it is heavily overbought that it will reverse. I buy an option to sell at this point for $8, and I buy 10 lots for $80, stating "EURUSD will be 20 pips lower in 2 hours." The reason this is a cheap option is because EURUSD moving that amount in that period of time is unlikely, BUT WITH MML WE HAVE AN EDGE THAT ALLOWS US TO PREDICT THESE REVERSALS SO WE ARE ABLE TO CAPITALIZE OFF OF THIS PRICE. The people pricing options do not factor in MML to their risk, they simply use time, volatility, news, etc. We take this low risk option and wait for the reversal.

Price can go up a little, doesn't matter because of our fixed risk. Lets say price drops 15 pips from our options price. The price of the option is now $40 because now the chance of the option expiring 20 pips below has increased. $40 x 10 lots, I now can close my options position for $400 or $320 profit. I was able to make a 32 pip profit, off of a 15 pip move. I was able to trade $10 per dollar move on the options price using $80 for leverage. $320 off of a 15 pip move is basically $20 a pip in regular forex, and I would never be able to get that kind of leverage with $80, and my stop would have to be extremely tight.

$80 got me a stop of 8 that can be hit however many times and a max profit potential of $920 with an option.

Forex options often have a dark cloud over it. One that is cluttered with scams, illegitimate sites, and people that think the only way to trade is using Binary Options that either expire in or out of the money for 70% returns. There is a legitimate way to use options in forex that allows you to leverage your positions for limited risk, and potentials that exceed what you would make in vanialla forex.

This might be off topic from what is going on here, but I believe options are truly a good option if you want your analysis and use of MML to be maximized without having to focus so much on stops, placing orders, taking profit, etc etc.

Hi Nghtmre, I have to say this is a very very good strategy. I don't know too much about options just have a few questions:

1. Who offered this option? Only this trading platform or others such as IB, Lmax can offer such this kind of option?

2. Is 20pips different in 2hrs with 1:11 payout instant or varies? I can't believer it is instant. Because I can bet 11 times EUR will drop for 20 pips when there is a big news. If I win once no lose. win twice that is 11 times of my bet.

3. Is it 100% your option can be processed. Will other people buy your option from the opposite side. This 11 times opportunity gambling is still unbelievable. Any pair can move up or down for 20 pips if there is a comparably big news.

4. From the example. Do I lose $80 straight away if EUR/USD goes up more than 20 pips in 10 or 20min after I purchased the sell option(which is 20pips lower in 2hrs).

Sorry English is not my first language

Thank you for your work.

You are right MurreyMath and Donchian Canal are part of the category of pivot , fibo , bollinger,  atr,  .....................

After studying the theory Murray math and read the indicator code.

I noticed that the range is calculated with a donchian channel.

I found it easier to use the channel only, with same  principle than MurreyMath.

What I like  : is the equal levels 12.50%.

The big advantage  of the Donchian channel ,is that there are a % oscillator = stochastic (A good statistical tool (I can explain this)).

So to improve your EA it may be necessary to add a second channel with another period.( Or another stochastic easier to code.)

Or to filter  add an Atr bands stops or Bollinger Bands Stops .

1. Options in forex are sometimes shady because for one most brokers take the opposite side of your trade, aka if you lose they win. Also most really only offer payouts that are 70% of your trade. You can tell if a broker is trading against you based on if they offer commission or not. A broker like Nadex who charges trading fees has no incentives to make you lose since they make money from when you trade. The way Nadex is set up allows you to actually "trade" options, buy and sell them rather than most other sites which are basically one click gambling sites.

2. The payout of 1:11 represents the MAX PROFIT that you can make from a trade. Now this is calculated given the expected volatility of a pair, the time remaining, and if there is news. So if there is a big news event the payout probably won't be 1:11, but maybe cut in half to 1:5 or 1:3 depending on how big the news event is. Each pair has their own calculation for X amount of pips needed for X reward So EURUSD will get a larger payout than GBPUSD for a 20 pip movement because 20 pips for EURUSD is not as likely as a 20 pip movement for GPBUSD. For GBPUSD a 30-35 pip movement is the equivalent of a EURUSD 20 pip move.

3. Yes the market orders are always filled. Nadex as far as I know doesn't take the other side of the trade, they charge commission. Again finding a reputable broker that does this is hard. If they don't charge commission they are likely trading against you.

4. No. And that is what I was saying. The max you can lose on a trade is $80 BUT, let's say your trade hits -$80, you haven't lost that yet. Price can come back down 40 pips and then your trade would be in profit and you would win. Options basically lets you have a stop loss that can be HIT MULTIPLE TIMES and still go into profit. So essentially I could sell at the +1/8 line with a binary with a risk of 8 pips and reward of 92. Price could move up 10 pips but the most I could lose is 8. Then price could reverse and my trade would be in profit. Price could move 50 pips against me but my loss is capped at -$80. That same -$80 can go into profit again if price comes back down, I do not need to place another order. You are never "stopped out" from a trade.

The point of buying a low risk option for $8, isn't that I expect it to reach the full profit level of 92, the amazing 1:11 risk:reward. I expect price to move enough for me to make a profit. That 1:11 risk:reward does not happen often, EURUSD moving 20 pips in 2 hours is rare these days. If price moves lets say 15 pips instead of the full 20, then the option price might reach 40 or 50 and I get out with a risk:reward of 1:5. But only certain brokers will allow you to buy and sell options before expiry, just as you would for stock options. I rarely hold an option to expiry, instead I use the leverage to buy lots of low risk options and wait for the price of that option to go up so that I can sell it and pocket a decent profit.

@Goldensniper, not necessarily. There is this idea that options in Forex only gives you returns less than your investment. To say that you can get a 100% - 500% return on an option is not really discussed among these forums since they are usually associated with a scam or as you said the "lotto." That is because most options brokers simply give you options that say "if price is 1 pip higher in 10 minutes you get 70% of your investment." This is essentially gambling. When you can buy and sell different options before expiry, this is trading and requires much more analysis than the usual binary option. The added variable of time and volatility offers another dimension for analysis however you gain the advantage of low risk and high leverage.

The strategy here is to use MML which can predict reversals fairly well to buy cheap out of the money options in hopes that the price of that option will triple or quadruple once the reversal happens. This is possible because those pricing the options do not take into consideration MML or key S/R. To the broker, the expected volatility should be normal, thus they price their options at a normal rate. However we know that there is a high volatility reversal coming therefore we can take advantage of the "miss-priced" option.

Here is an example: At around 3:30 am I saw some resistance around the +1/8 4 Hour line (I think it was the +1/8 hourly line too, the lines have been recalculated since). I sold an option priced at $67 (a $33 risk), stating that "EURUSD will be 9 pips lower than the current price at 7 am." I bought 10 lots of this so my max loss on the trade would be $330 if I let the option expire out of the money. I could close it earlier at a lower loss if I think it won't be profitable. This usually is too much risk for me but I was sure it would reverse. I could have gotten in at a price closer to the +1/8 level, I was not paying attention and bought the option after it reversed 10 pips already.

I managed to close the trade when the option was priced at $26.5. Price was about 10 pips lower than where I bought it and there was 10 minutes left until expiration. If we are selling we want the option to be priced lower than where we bought it, so now the option priced at $26.5 is approx worth $750 ($100- approx. $25 x 10 lots = $750). I closed my trade for about $400 profit which makes sense because I sold it at $67 and bought it at about $27, a 40 point difference in the price of the option.

I made $400 off of a 9 pip movement using 10 lots. In forex that would have taken me 40 pips. If I had bought the option at a much better price say $90, a max risk of 10 and it reached a price of $50, I would have made 4 times my investment. But that is the beauty of options. Based on calculated risk using time, volatility, and proximity to the target price, you can take advantage of small price movements and leverage them with options, all while limiting your risk.

What I would have done differently here is take a much lower risk trade, perhaps an $8 option stating it will reverse 20 or 30 pips then buy it back when the price of that option hits maybe $25-$30, it is less profit, but it is less risk. I bought the option after significant rejection at the +1/8 level, I could have gotten in at a better price and lower risk.

These screenshots are taken from my account statement but I will try to take pictures of the trades as they are happening.

The indicator is useful Sohocool, I especially like the ability to shift it some on the chart.

I've set it @ -50 taking it left a little and off the current candle area. I've noticed with this the

Quantum signals also shift staying with the lines so I've set their color to none and loaded quantum

itself which is a good work around for that issue. Means I can keep them on the candles where they belong.

I have the actual Quantum number set at 64 as well, matching your settings in the indicator.

Watching, catching the actions as PA moves, realizing a few things. For instance I notice

adjusting that Q number adjusts the spread of the indicator lines. Other things I'm looking at as

well, the way the lines expand and contract, the steps ups etc etc. All showing us something.

Just a final thought, it's no biggie and not sure of it could be done but if possible next build perhaps

the Q boxes could stick with the candles. Meaning quantum indicator wouldn't need to be loaded, but as

I mentioned, no biggie. I've explained my work around that ^_^

cheers and thanks

I sent a similar message to a member who wanted some help with MML, so I'll post it here as well. For those that want bigger profits and less screen monitoring time I think as many have stated before, that trading in the direction of higher time frames is important. I just wanted to demonstrate how one would go about this analysis before placing a trade.

Higher time frames always take preference over lower time frames. Lower time frames are for entry to scale into larger trades in the direction of higher time frames.

Lets take this GBPUSD set up that could have been taken on 3/21. My set up is to have the next higher time frame MML on the current time frame. So my H4 chart will show the daily MML, my hourly chart will show the 4H MML, and my 15 minute chart will show the hourly MML.

1. If you look at the 4H chart you will see that there is plenty of "space" above price, there is no daily resistance for a while, plenty of space for profit. Also it is oversold.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

2. If you look at the hourly chart there is no significant 4 hour resistance. The 3/8 level is not really important in terms of MML reversals, and if you look at the chart the 3/8 line does not clearly represent any resistance.
Attached Image

3. Although not pictured here, the 15 minute candle bounced off of the -1/8 line hourly and we would have bought here during the london trade and had nothing but profit until the NY session.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The takeaway is to make sure there is enough space in the higher time frames to make a decent profit, and then use the smaller time frames to pinpoint an entry.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Here is a good set up. We see rejection at the daily +1/8 line on EURUSD. Also price is at +1/8 on 4 hour line.

I separated the quantum period  from the  Donchian channel period .(in fact we have two "donchian", now.)

Shift : only for Channel.

Normally Shift only positive.

Looking at several CAD related pairs some of which have reset from the break out of the extreme levels after waiting for the M15 candle to close.

On these CAD pairs I've resisted from making an entry.

NZDCAD is on my watch list however the bulls are still driving price higher at this time.

Observation time but looking for signs of rejection at the resistance level shown on the chart by the red rectangle.

A break up through this zone could see price tag the +2/8 level in which case I'll reassess for a short again in that zone and not before.

1 lot on this trade since the MML gaps are smaller than other pairs otherwise I'd likely trade it with only 0.5 lots or maybe as low as 0.25 lots.

Note: If PA looks to drive up hard past the resistance level then the trade may be closed out earlier. There is no need to endure excess loss in pips if chart structure gets broken and this is key to preserving an account.

Oops forgot to load the chart as I use it with Solocools new indicator, will now go in and load the update. Basically yes you got it Soho, Quantum signals on the candles, nice work. I didn't expect such a quick reply though, thanks for the time doing that.

First charts the original version with quantum on the lines indShift is set @ -40 The Q sigs look a bit out of place there, which is why I wanted them set on the candles as has been done with the update.

What I'm trying to do with quantum is trade them not as they were originally supposed to be traded, take the signal as it appeared on the chart. This leads to a tremendous drawdown, shudder no thanks. I had the idea a while ago well why not take the trade when the trend had actually turned. Not so easy though picking when that happens which is where this new indicator appears so helpfu. Hence I'm trying to take Qsigs as a reference of where to buy after the turnl. At the yellow area on the chart the dochian line is at oversold. Testifying also to this is the RSI set @ 4, green, and @ 14 red. The buy signal being as 14 crosses 4. The blue is an indicator named Accumulation Spread Index. Also testifying of oversold/overbought. When the 14 RSI shows divergence the ASI is better at showing the actual turn.

I didn't but if I had taken the trade long at the RSI cross over using those two Qsigs as the reference there's 100 pips each available. This is what I'm trying to do anyway.

Davits pivot on-board as well which is why I've set this @ -40. TDI-clone's in there as well set as color none so I can run angelator.

Do you have time to add in a vetical line that meets the following criteria:

Lets call it a Look_back_line.

The code reads the current period of Quantum.

Prints to the chart a vertical line that is X_periods behind the current candle based on user input Q setting.

As a new candle updates the Look_back line also updates and moves in sequence one candle position.

[the previous Look_back line is deleted out after a new Look_back line is printed to the chart]

What we have now is a boundary defined by the period of Quantum that updates 1 candle at a time.

For example, if Q=100 then the vertical Look_back line would always remain 100 candle spaces behind the current candle.

Additional Options:

a) Allow for any user input Q look back period to be applied

b) Print user set Quantum period next to the Look_back line (eg Q Look_back = 100 Bars)

c) Line options for color, weight etc.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Nice work.

What we need is the octaves to be applied within a chosen higher time frame such as what you have drawn manually except to have it drawn by an indicator.

So inside the MML indicator have it coded with an option to place internal octaves automatically between 2 chosen MML higher TF levels but also include the extreme MMLs such as +-1/8 and +-2/8.

This could be coded into the indicator you use on your chart or any other MML indicator for that matter.

Something to consider at least.

I mostly trade off the Daily from the 64/256 down to the 64/4 looking at the in between 128,64,32,16 and 8 to form my trading opinion, do not find any need to drop down to intra day timeframes

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Yes a daily TF is a bit more robust forsure provided you keep the risk to reward favorable.

Not great to have multiple entries where you have made say 20-30 pips but risked over 100 pips in the process.

Taking tighter entries really close to these MML levels may assist but I'd always be dropping down to say an M5 chart for a neater entry with ofcourse the TP mated to the Daily MML.

In the background I have a GN Daily chart (MT4) playing out with a 64 trading day Trading Frame applied but with only the larger 5 circles of conflict drawn internally. The idea is to see if it has any substance to it or its just unnecessary.

I'll keep updating it here from time to time but things can move slowly on a D1 chart so patience is needed.

Reset and shifting of the Trading Frame will not occur until +-3/8 MML is breached.

Dynamic shifting at the time of breach would shift the frame along the y-axis only until completion of 64 trading days when a new Frame is constructed.

The new Frame is constructed by considering the most recent trading ranges (H-L on the extreme closes only) of the previous 64 day period.

Smaller internal Trading Frames can be constructed and traded if preferred ... all dynamic in nature meaning they shift and align with the global PA.

gann said each instrument has its own "vibration"

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...73#post8397673

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...ic#post8397682

there is the code for the obtaining the "vedic" quantum numbers from price

so all that is needed is the code for making the levels, lines like the murrey lines 9or would it be circles?) but based on the rodin fractal

similar to Murrey Math because it is fractals but based on something that is supposedly a naturally occurring  fractal

What happened to the longer term MML + quantum setup on the AUDUSD M15 pair?

The following chart will provide a clear enough answer.

Initial post is #138 for reference.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Note 1: MML labels have reset since initial posting.

Note 2: Quantum applied to the initial and final charts was 2000 for entry and exit.

Note 3: If using Q=2000 as an exit TP for every trade opened the TPs had a range from 120 to 200 pips each.

Note 4: SL @ -3/8 MML missed by a sizable distance

Note 5: A pure Quantum cycle could have been traded in this example without any MML considerations whatsoever.

Note 6: However, the MML levels on a H4 and P=64 setting did offer some form of confirmation that price was indeed oversold.

Note 7: Considering HTF MML + Quantum setups might be ideal for those keen on limited chart time and bigger pip counts.

ps. This setup was not traded by the way only observed throughout.

pps. But I will be looking to trade them very very soon.

Mastermind I may be having a brain dead moment but the way I look at a period of time is as follows, if the look back period is 240min and I wanted to use a 15min chart I would use a MM 16 = 16, 15 min bars in 240min or if I wanted to see it in a 1 min chart view I would use a MM 256 being the nearest MM number to 240 to my way of thinking this keeps both time and price square, sorry if I am way off the mark but it is Saturday and I should be giving my brain a rest but right or wrong made a few bob trading this way but using Wkly, Daily, 60min & 5mins set to MM 256

--- 帖子 #627 ---
What I was trying to say in my last post (633) was that in the Murrey I use XARD777 he as a button marked beginner and if you set it or indeed leave it as default to 0 it will automatically give the Murrey number best fit for the timeframe that you are looking at, so all I do is punch in the period length and the programme does the rest, this way it does not force fit a 64 to all timeframes or conditions, sorry for any confusion with my last post

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Perhaps what might be useful is an historical analysis of the number of times price pushes beyond the extreme MML levels on a given MML setting.

Criteria might include:

1. Events where the +- 2/8 MML extreme levels actually held price.

2. Events where the +- 2/8 MML extreme levels did not hold price.

3. Liklihood of winning reversal setups to at least the next MML level, to the 2nd MML level, to the 3rd MML level, 4/8 etc etc (in the direction of TP).

I wonder if any trader has performed a backtest similar to the above so that some type of confidence in a reversal on a given setting is known.

Ofcourse no amount of backtesting can give full confidence moving forward but it does at least offer a statistical view.

What I would like to know is for example, on the GBPUSD pair what is the probability using an MML setting of 64, H4 that a short or a long trade based on either + or - 2/8 MML level that price will hit the 8/8, 7/8, 6/8 MML or 1/8, 2/8, 3/8 etc

ps. It would be nice to see the calculations in the code (of xard777) that perform the best fit operation ... is it available?

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Or a trader could be patient .....

Wait for a push up high by the bulls ....

Wait for formation of a neat pin bar ...

Then nail a short entry with TP at the next lower MML level which is 7/8 in this case.

Gold shows an example of an easy shorting setup however it is taken from the 8/8 MML on an M15 TF P=64, MMP=240.

One issue though is actually being present and watching the setup unfold on the chart and then being able to watch multiple setups.

I have no idea whats happening to match your charts with xard777 I have to use a 512 my 1st chart is letting xard find best fit which turns out to be a 32 and as I say I have to use a 512 to match your chart, because of the length of time spent in the octave the 64 and 32 reads the same with Xard

On a current bullish mission!

Danger of holding positions over the weekend when PA can be influenced by news events that drive the commodity in a particular direction.

In brief, go for a TP at the next MML level but do not allow trades to run over the weekend since the MML level may not get hit, not anytime soon that is unless the bears get onboard again.

Last trading day of the week just close it out for whatever profit it presents and look to reset for another entry early the next week.

Note: As price pushes up higher into the +1/8 MML look for an opportunity to short Gold down but be very very careful because what a trader needs to also consider is what reason is it that is causing Gold to surge up strongly just in early Tokyo trade?

Closed 1 long out for +13.6 pips

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Original long still in action.

Note 1: Closed out due to price finding in my opinion an area of consolidation and an unwillingness to keep driving higher so the idea is to take profit.

Note 2: Reason being that should AJ decide to turn and head south I will have gained some profit to offset any potential loss.

Note 3: If price continues to push higher then the result will be reduced DD on the current long trade and less profit had I kept the 2nd long active.

Note 4: If price does drop back down near the -1/8 MML then I'll look to go long again but also aware that price may hit the -2/8 MML.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Fact is I just chose the M15 TF because its relatively central and about as high a TF as you can go for getting into and out of the majority of your trades on the same day.

Overlaid with the H4 looked good from an ADR point of view and the likelihood of hitting perhaps 1-2 MML levels for TP on the same day.

Apart from that it was simply a starting place.

I am yet to trade other MML settings however I will be trading say an M1/M5 TF (with P and MMP to be decided) for in the Asian session and looking to hit smaller but effective TPs (higher lots).

Yes broker D1 close candles can be an issue.

I tend to go for the brokers that close at 5pm EST (NY).

However, at the end of the day I think the trader has to be satisfied that whichever broker candle close they apply that it leads to profitable trading.

I will always look towards the PA on any given chart of any given instrument to provide entries into trades.

MML levels reset and when that happens it actually might be worth considering getting out of the trade.

In any case I only applied 0.5 lots so that a reasonable stop could be applied for an over-night run.

my 2 cents to MML users

using 3 BB's will give you: boundaries, sense of direction, higher percentage of knowing the active MML level, price jumping between bands a sign of reversal. work with all TF, small TF=more squeeze, higher TF=more accurate.

settings: period 100, shift0, apply to close, deviations: 1, 2, 3 .

adding 100 SMA with different color.

Thanks for the screen shot, I have noticed your best winners are the ones that went against you the most, letting you build a number of entries before it turns round, that's something that I except you have to live with, but I am not to sure if I could cope with that, but you are doing very well so fair play to you my friend, thanks for the thread, yours is a good method and there are some very good guys post on here

Has anyone taken interest in trading towards the levels instead of reversing from it. What I mean is that generally speaking during times of increased volume, FO, LO, NYO, price tends to travel to the nearest obvious level of support and resistance. I've seen it happen time and time again. You see a sudden price push until price reaches a level. This happened today during the NYO,

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

At around 9 am, when there is usually increased volume from the New York Session, you would notice that price was oversold at an area of support, but by looking at the volume and size of the bar you would see that price is heading somewhere and no surprise it stops at the +1/8 minute level. You would surely make more money detecting this surge in price and the level it is heading to, than trying to guess a reversal. Just some food for thought.

Have you ever noticed that when price is very close to an area of strong support and resistance that it just drops or pushes up extremely fast? Like it has to reach that level? This could be an alternative way to trade these levels. Price surges toward/near the 0/8 and +1/8 level can usually be taken until the level is reached. I would only recommend doing this at the opens of sessions, around 2 am, 3 am, and 9 am when there are sudden increases in volume.

If price drops to about the 5/8 MML I'll consider closing both trades to avoid an over the weekend situation.

The risk is that the bulls return and drive price back up to retest current highs.

Do murray lines always recalculate when they cross 2/8 or -2/8?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Yes of course

--- 帖子 #735 ---
MML does not recalculate passing +/- levels, they will give you the new levels with the same octave size, but within the current period it might recalculate.

for example: if you are using MML with 64p on H1 and the current octave size is 16, if the price pass the high and low within the current 64p, it recalculate and give you higher octave size from 16 to 32.

MML will show you the current levels but keep in mind that levels above and below do exist but not shown.

the pic below show 3 types of MML:

on the right show levels of current TF(H1), octave size 30.6

on the left show levels of D1, octave size 122

the one with fibo levels is fixed levels from 2013, octave size 244

1 fixed octave contain 2 octaves of D1

1 D1 octave contain 4 octaves of H1

hi guys,

this is an interesting thread

Just some questions

1) anyone trading real account with this?

2) I saw vgyuszko's youtube tutorial on 1st post about MM indi setup. It says if you trade 5 min chart, MMPeriod = 60 (which is 1h). if you trade 15 min chart, MMPeriod = 240 (which is 4h). Anyone knows, what's the MMPeriod setting for higher tf, like 1H or 4H?

3) Are there any EA based on MM?

Thanks a bunch

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Someone was asking about my calendar indi... Here it is.. You can edit settings as you please.

For the regular posters, again another thank you from myself. I am learning lots about technical anayslis, and what I believe to be core essential areas of trading such as PA, S&R, Key Levels and of course MML. Thanks again.

Hi,

I made a simple web/app.. for fast check the pairs... while mq4 has a lots of grahical content...so i simply made some screenshots..and upladed to the web.

So i can check the data what i need from the indicators from mobile...anytime.

In this case, i made some features.....for this topic..at the weekend.

I hope its helps. And you can save image and attach here if see something. ( from mobile )

This is a test... i think its working.. ( hoping for mq4 don't crash and stop seeding the data ). its on a virtual server ...and seeding the data every 1 min.

But you need to manually refresh the page.

...I used the mml, quantum, autotrend, and the calendar...from this forum.

We could decide the best template for use for the different shots.

Hey great idea.  I did something similar except I would feed an image to a cloud storage and send the user a link via push notification.

So is it like a web app where when we go to the website on our phones we see the images or is it a separate app that retrieves the webimages from that page and sends them to itself to display to the user.   If you want PM me and we can discuss.

Thnx for the great idea, you just gave me an alternate that I can use for my friends and clients , awesome ..

Same as yesterday but higher Octave

--- 帖子 #759 ---
you are missing a major rule of Murrey, he used 64p as default to know if the market is ranging or trending, small octaves means the pair is in it's lowest ranging for the last 64p, think of it as bollinger band squeeze, you should trade in the direction of the +/- 2/8 break. to me, I like this approach so I stay away from ranging pairs and find trending ones.

example when math works together
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Fair comment, but I like to use Daily Range to see how many Octaves or sub octaves we can cross, Murrey says that the Gbp likes to move in 64 & 32 and give the reason, other pairs may have a different cycle, he is referring to DAYS, when I drop down to intra day just prefer to use something that as logic based on a Day, week, Month or Year, but I do take your point and thank you

--- 帖子 #761 ---
exactly, that's what I don't like about xard777 indi, it does not have TF period to remove the guessing part.

other indi's have TF options, so you can trade H1 for example and use H4 or D1 MMPeriod without changing the 64p rule.

I did love the sub levels in xard777 indi but used to drive me crazy when not knowing the higher TF exact levels.

that's why I commented on your post because you reminded me about my old days

wish you the best

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Right or wrong my interest lies in the amount of data I want to see on my chart, the size of the octave be it 256 128 64 32 16 8 or what ever number is not important to me as long as its of a tradable size, I find the sub lines of great importance on showing me the level of acceptance of a new octave, but like everything in this game there is no holy grail, just use what ever works for you. I am happy with my approach as I say right or wrong, can enter a trade with controlled R/R and reasonable size stops , do not allways do it right but hey more often that's my fault not my chart

When price breaches 1265 (which it has) do the following:

Trail it as you see fit.

Thank you! Gold and silver just broke through and are now hovering around a significant point of resistance.  Will be interesting to see if the previous Res. turns into support or if it dives back down.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Just keep a close watch on any further Syrian news.

If it escalates further look for an opportunity to buy Gold and silver, look at JPY pairs too.

If it appears to be settling somewhat then look for a shorting opportunity.

Mate up the fundamentals or political drivers with the key technical levels and get some good old fashioned confluence on your side so that your entries have additional probability of turning into winners.

Good trading,

Hi vgyuszko,

I was wondering what happened to your TE.

I think you must have deleted the TE as I can see the DD was starting to escalate which can happen with Quantum.

Because even if the demo account expires via the broker it is still possible to keep the demo account attached to the Trade Explorer here.

Can you reattach it please I'd like to see the final lot of trades if possible.

Take care,

As mentioned in my last post looked after my 3 grand kids yesterday and I think they must have sent me a little mad, been playing with my setup to see if I can find more than 1 reason to take a trade at a Murrey line so I added a Bollinger set to my Murrey number with a 2 and 3 std deviation this is to confirm a trend and show OB/OS at Murrey lines, then to overload my chart even more, 2 CCI to match Murrey with 1 being a half trend this also shows me OB/OS conditions at Murrey lines, to be fair its a little busy but my eyes can cope and does give me more reasons to take a trade

Admire your efforts, but for what ever reason there now seems a total lack of interest in the thread, its a shame as I for one found it very interesting even though I must admit the Quantum side of it scared the S--T out of me

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I see..hope its temporaly...seen a lot of good trades and charts here...

I believe quantum works..I mean..statistically up quantum..always visit lower..and doen quantum...always (95%) meet higher price...if you set the quantum indicator right....maybe the reason behind is psichological...but statistic is statistic...

Now im running quantum input depth on 60 on EUR/USD...

Are there any traders following my trade entries?

Very simple setups with a keen eye for PA, chart structure and market awareness.

The entries have been fairly good when you start considering the very low DD that this account shows.

Lets see if this continues.

Following along with say a 100K live account would have been looking good in the amount of $32K.

Any trader doing this?

Certainly do not expect to hear a yes or no but hopefully its of some benefit otherwise likely I'll turn it to private and cease to trade it when 100% gain in equity has been achieved.

Just a question though ... how many traders are trading this live?

My next quest will be a live account probably after this current demo account has been doubled.

Good trading,

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #841 ---
and then back to doubling demos uh ?

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Yes I trade MM with live account, and I believe my first trade entry is always right (sadly that's not always the case) that's why the Quantum does nothing for me as my initial trade is way more than 0.001 so have to use a stop and wait to re enter if wrong, the advantage as I see it is when I do get it right first time I can bank a healthy profit very quickly without the need to constantly being wrong just to add positions to build a pip value up

I am very interested, cos i run a quantum based EA, which with some manual intervention is proving profitable. My aim is to further develop the EA to improve the quantum signal in particular when it gets into trending periods, that is why i am looking at murrey math but i am finding difficult to under how to implement it and test it.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
I am not taking the trades at the same time as you because we are on opposite sides of the world. But if I were online when you post a setup, I would take it without hesitation.

I usually wake up around 3AM my local time so that I can have a few hours of trading before heading out to work for the day. Then, I trade a little more after I get home from work. I hope to be here when you are sometime as I'd love to catch one of your setups.

Thank you again for all of your help, Masterrmind. I cannot say that enough.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
EA is not working for me it says it is unable to open indicator. can anyone assist?

--- 帖子 #846 ---
That is usually because you need to have the appropriate indicators in your indicator folder. Look at the error code again, it will tell you which indicator it can't open. Make sure this indicator is in your indicators folder. Restart MT4 and check your logs to make sure you're not getting the error anymore.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
I will attach the error I am getting. I have the quantum indicator in my indicators folder I am able to apply it to my charts.

I have gotten the correct indicators here now but odd It is not opening any trades when back tested.

Hi, after reading many threads and looking at all these amazing new indicators I decided to turn the clock back and re look at some of the old fashioned indicators, here are my thoughts and screen shots, Daily chart with MM 256 with Bollinger to match (256) and standard Macd, 60min with MM 128 Bollinger to match (128) + Macd, 5min with MM 256 + Bollinger to match (256) + Macd, 1min with MM1024 + Bollinger to match (1024) + Macd, I think we all know the rules to trade Bollinger Bands & Macd then I have the MurreyMaths rules as well,

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Some more Murrey/Bollinger/Macd fun, can you see any trades ?

--- 帖子 #874 ---
MM levels seem ok ?

--- 帖子 #875 ---
I tend to think at this stage that looking for long or short opportunities simply from the MML lines is good enough to generate some 'good' trades.

Far too often I see traders adding more and more of this indicator and that indicator and really I think its not necessary.

Keep it simple and if in doubt simply do not take the trade ... wait for one that you feel comfortable about engaging with.

Looking at many ideas though certainly keeps the mind active and this is very important but what I would propose is to look towards adding in some good old fashioned fundamental analysis (not necessarily too deep though just enough to form a bias on a currency pair to either look to go long or to look to go short - more practical in linger term trade setups though).

Confluence is what builds a good case for entry (not all will turn out):

MML levels

Fibs

Psych levels (000, 50 levels)

Harmonic moves (simple 1 to 1 completions of the ABCD or AB=CD that open up reversal opportunities from extreme MML levels +- 1 and 2 MML)

Fundamentals (Central banker chat, hints of where they would like a pair to be trading) Not always useful but always important!

General market awareness (geopolitical stability or lack of etc etc)

Good trading,

Hi, as usual you are bang on the money with your post, I think we both know the value of MM and it works as a stand alone indicator, but I just want the thread to be a little more active hence throwing ideas into the pot, I perhaps use MM in a slightly different way than you, ( timeframes & numbers) but it works in the same way as all the other indicators but in my view a little better as it is one of the very few that is NOT lagging, thank you for your posts of which I follow with great interest but as I mostly trade Gbp pairs I do not copy your trades, I am willing just to post any chart with any indicator that highlights or increases the value of MM

Hope you do not mind my input as it's a Gbp pair, I see a chart shift down on a 5min so I would be looking to sell on bounces (scalping trades)

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Comments are always welcome.....

My view as follows:

1. Looking for a pullback to take price back up with my trade attached into a selling zone to then be followed by a short entry that moves with the longer term order flow down.

2. Viewed as risky to take a long and also being the last trading day of the week, only half position size applied and only taken on demo account (not traded on my live account due to above points).

So why trade it at all even on the demo one may well ask?

1. Risky but good opportunity if support held

2. Loss was only a small part of the gain already made on account thus far

3. As it turned out only just got taken out but taken out nonetheless.

The volatile pairs usually need a large stop depending on the setup but by trading 0.5 lots I was not prepared to lose more than a few hundred....in my view worth the risk taken for the potential gain.

Unfortunately the gain was not made in this case.

But winning every trade is not possible and another reason why I only risked a few hundred dollars on over 3000 made so far.....

Another approach to this trade setup on GA would have been to wait for price to move up closer to the selling zone and then look to short the pair which would have been in sync with the longer term order flow....

Looking forward to next week....

Hope this is of some value....

Bears happy to keep taking price lower at this stage.

Keep a watch over the -1/8 MML followed by -2/8 MML.

The -2/8 MML looks more favorable at this early stage as it lies in confluence with the 1.36 handle or close to it.

I'll be looking for a bounce up somewhere near to these levels.

May also average into the trade by opening 0.1 lots near the -1/8 MML followed by 0.1 lots at the -2/8 MML.

However, I would want to see some action by the bulls in terms of PA in and around these 2 zones.

Don't forget about the oil talk early today and what likely impact it might have on the driving force of the CAD currency!

Major session opens should also be on your minds (Hint: Frankfurt into London session !!).

But that is beside the point.

Millionaires also live in Africa my friend.

I plan to show that almost any trader can start small at say 2K and over time grow the account into a much larger one which can then be traded at far less risk not more.

The current trading account is being traded at a maximum of 0.2 lots per $2000 balance.

Do you think I trade at this ratio on a 100k account?

My point is that the risk applied to this small 2k account is as high as any trader should go and probably less is better.

Daily percent gain at a realistic DD are the key considerations here.

Money management, trade management and risk management are also just as important.

Grow a small account wisely and before long it will be as large as you need.

Good trading,

Hi, this is the way right or wrong that I use MurreyMaths,

1. I look for pairs with a reasonable Daily Range (Chart 1) I am happy to bank 25/30pips out of a 100 range with the time of day that I start trading

2. I look at the big picture by means of a Daily with a MM64 over a 256 period (Chart 2) use as a road map to see were we are, also I think the MM levels are much stronger

3. I then drop down to a 1min set to a MM64 over a 1440 period (Chart 3) this clearly lets me see yesterdays price action, ie are we going to make new highs or lows compared to yesterday, how many pips have I can I aim for (level to level) using the best levels etc etc.

As mentioned I mostly trade the Gbp Pairs living in the UK and sit down around 8am so the Asian sessions are in my sleep time, but I would say that I do monitor the hourly ranges as well as we are aware some hours are better to trade then others, with this in mind been playing with (Chart 4) which shows Fibs taken from the previous hour.

Nice commentary.

Yes taking a portion of pips from a given range is very logical considering we know not what the future holds but we can get some idea from previous trading ranges and the use of averages.

I'm fortunate to live in a time zone (GMT+10) that allows me to trade the Asian session, London session and a part of the NY session.

This means I'm always on the lookout for opportunities within most of these sessions.

I tend to drop down to the M5 TF (and M1 including tick charts on other platforms at times) the most to see the PA occurring at chart critical zones (potential engagement zones).

Thanks for your opinion on the M1 setup and I'll be sure to take a look at this on typical Asian session pairs, although its likely that setups may occur much later in the session as PA is rather calm at the start of the trading day, although with good/bad data release coming out of Tokyo Open or thereabouts a pair can get a good kick up to a potential engagement zone at the MML levels.

Due to a typical decreased pip range in the Asian Trading Window (compared to LO and NY) it therefore suggests that smaller pip gaps between the MML octaves would need to be or should be traded.

In any case I'll have a good look at M1 and M5 TFs using your settings and see how it looks from next week.

I do keep track of certain trading window time slots with regards to ADR and actual trading range averages over given periods of time so an appreciation for a realistic number of pips can be made at trade entry...adjustments can then be made to fit with current chart strcuture and the recent PA for the purposes of stop and TP placement.

I'll post a few charts later and also into next week and see what it all looks like.

Thanks for your input it is appreciated.

Certainly not much enthusiasm for the thread.

Its a pity really as the trade setups are not that difficult to understand.

Yes and price is pushing up to the next level on both pairs.

ECad heading up to +1/8 MML.

EN heading up to +2/8 MML.

So patience might pay off as I'll be looking for a chance to short from the upper levels.

Interestingly I was just measuring out the ADR's on both pairs and if price hits the MMLs it almost coincides with their average daily trading ranges.

Note 1: Possible to go long at market now with a possible TP at the next MML or above but its risky and there is a lack of momentum in the PA.

Note 2: An entry at market now followed by PA to the downside for a retest of the days lows would have your trade eating extra DD ... is it worth the risk?

Note 3: Or wait for London Open before deciding!

From what I have seen so far I think a maual trading approach using MML levels is the way to go.

But when taking trades against the trend at extreme MML levels a hard stop placed at 50% of the octave gap or at most the full octave gap is tge way to go.

This MML indicator does produce some very good zones in advance of the fact and is ideal.

However, with any manual trading approach some discretion is required and the all important money management is key here.

I think a trader could do quite well if they resist the temptation of hanging on too long to trades tgat decide to continue hard in line with the trend.

A relatively smaller ratio between lot size and balance (equity) provides a little cushioning in trades left on the table longer but eventually they may need to be closed out.

The 2 EU shorts I have running now come to mind.....

All in all I think the levels can work rather well.

Masterrmind........

--- 帖子 #977 ---
I've had a good look over some of his material and noted the following:

1. Tends to like simplistic chart patterns eg on D1 TF looking for say 2 bullish followed by 2 bearish candles to get into a short that lasts for weeks.

*I heard nothing about fundamental analysis in his video at all which is something the banks tend to thrive on in LT trading not simply the technicals.

2. Generally a longer term swing trader attempting to gain in the 300-500 pips range (very difficult to achieve on a regular basis!).

3. Does trade intraday but not his preferred strategy.

4. He mentions stop placement and trying to cut your losers short for say 6 pip loss but when trading on a D1 chart this is almost impossible as HTF setups dictate much larger stops since you would want your stop under (or above) recent swing lows (or highs).

5. Perhaps he has some of his verified trading history available but it was not obvious to me as to where it could be viewed.

6. All I saw on his website was screenshots and testimonials from "clients" mobile phone captures.

Anyway this is not about him so I'll stop at that!

In terms of the 2*D1 Up followed by 2*D1 Down and enter short for the MML I see no issue with this on the HTF setups however, if you wait for the closure of say the 2nd D1 bearish candle you have already missed potentially alot of the move. Unless ofcourse you drop to a lower TF within that D1 candle horizon and look to enter from MML on a lower TF such as M15.

Especially if a trader had simply got into the short as soon as the last bullish push up to the MML zone had completed ... this is when you would want to enter into the trade and apply a modest stop .... which is price continues to move up would take you out but at least you have the opportunity to re-enter short again upon additional chart analysis.

One idea might be to look for this D1 reversal pattern but to then drop to a lower TF searching for a suitable setup to trade in the short direction of the pair in the case where the last 2 D1 candles were red (bearish) .

I simply see this move as a potential transfer of strength from the bulls to the bears (or bears to the bulls) and if the longer term suggested a short setup ten I'd drop to say an M15 TF and look at a trade setup that moves in sync with the D1 TF.

Perhaps this has some merit in it.....

Lets find out.

ps. I'll post some D1 Chart setups say on the GBP pairs (as I know these are your favorite trading symbols) which should not take that long to find.

pps. I'll also be looking at the historical data on these type setups and searching for the reasons why some fail "Would the D1 candle range have anything to do with it?".

Good trading,

GBPCAD D1 Chart

2 red followed by 2 blue

Potential (in hindsight) long setup.

Would have worked out very well on this occasion.

Note on this pair that recent PA has not shown very many 2 + 2 setups but when it did the trend continued for multiple days.

The difficult part might be in how to best trail your trade.

Interesting!

ps. Just noticed that there is also a setup several days prior to the one I showed on the chart which was also to the long side and would have been a clear winner to the upside.

pps. Note that on both these examples that the market came back down to retest the recent lows which would have offered an even greater risk reward trade if the trader was patient enough to wait. The downside of this however, is that the market does not drop down to retest and you miss the trade!

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Just to clarify....

The SL only needs to be 20 pips or so below the low of the 4 candle cluster.

On a D1 Chart setup Id look for a slightly greater stop based on assigned risk per setup.

I indicate risk per setup because my intention would be to average into the trade with a possible 2 longs.

Trade 1 at the close of the 2nd bullish candle

Trade 2 at the possible retest of the 4candle low ... a buy limit order could be applied if preferred.

What would be useful is an indicator that identifies both long and short 4candle setups on a D1 Chart.

Then  a 4candle dashboard that displays user preferred symbols in a column and which ones are setting up and in what direction...perhaps simple enough.

Then perhaps have the dashboard apply multiple TFs eg H1, H4, D1, W1 and perhaps MN.

Food for thought.

Masterrmind.........

--- 帖子 #981 ---
As usual thanks again for the thoughtful and in depth reply, I agree with what you have said, my thoughts were, if it turned out to be a decent solid signal we as you have said just drop down timeframes and trade the pull backs off preferred Murrey levels in the same signal direction, if we have to layer in it would not be so much of a problem as we have solid S/R at a near given level.

ps They may perhaps fail from time to time if they appear in OB/OS (+/- 1/8th or 2/8ths) on a Murrey Big dog chart (MM64 on a 256 daily chart)

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Yes I agree with you.

They may fail from time to time and this was 1 reason why I would open 1 position at half position size followed by another one if a retest occurred.

Could be a nice easy strategy with not alot of effort involved for a trader that prefers relatively smaller position sizes on trades that may take weeks to play out.

Nice easy position trading in combination with the MML.

How would you decide on an initial TP level?

1. Once trade setup occurs determine SL, then based on number of pips set the TP to at least a 1 to 1 or better.

2. For a short set TP just above longer term support or resistance in the case of a long trade making sure a 1 to 1 at the mininum exists.

3. How about trailing?

ATR method that he used in the video? Hmmm.

Id probably look to lock in at BE + a few pips once price moved in my favor and was close to either a S or R area.

Or an MML level that matches with the trade setup.

Masterrmind..........

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Think I would need to see how many signals I get (Daily) then see the kind of moves (Length of moves in pips) then see if an average R/R could be found, but I think you would make a lot of money with perhaps just a 2 to 1 R/R ( the position of entry in reguards to MM) might be a factor, got to nip out now but have a look at that G/N both Daily and 60min, expand my reply this afternoon when I get back

--- 帖子 #988 ---
Can I just re-fresh your memory with a chart set up I posted way back when, think it might lend its self to this entry method well , saves the time and trouble dropping down timeframes ?

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Mastermind, Been doing a little eye balling of Daily Charts searching for this signal method, I am finding that the best ones are coming when price moves into a new Octave (Daily) and its then has to be accepted or rejected either way it mostly then goes on to make the nearest new or old main MM Octave level

Closed out AUD/JPY at break-even, should have taken my 10 pips.

I'm going to go over the CAD/JPY trade because I have had a great deal of success with this recently.

First I'm going to drop this chart that everyone has seen but most people do not use.

Attached Image

Here is my CAD/JPY chart

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In the murray chart you see 2-3-2-3-0/8's.

You will see in the CAD/JPY chart it makes that exact movement then has a very nice pin bar off of 0/8.  It also is off a nice point of support as well.

I've had great success recently looking for nice candle stick formations off of 0/8 after it has gone 2-3-2-3/8's.  It does not have to move exactly in those lines either it could go slightly out on each side as long as it resembles the movement.

I've been pouring over the D1 Charts too.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Worthy of note is the overlap section marked on the D1 chart of GBPCAD which can throw you out of then back into another long trade victorious to the upside!

Notice how small the loss was though in the first trade taken out of this overlap section.

Perhaps not all are like this but I'll search through the D1 charts and try to find some 'nasty' examples.

As a possible exit I see the following:

If a long setup has occurred look to exit on the close of 2 D1 bearish candles in a row.

If a short setup has occurred look to exit on the close of 2 D1 bullish candles in a row.

There are also examples (plenty) to be seen in the D1 charts that even if you get kicked out of the trade using the above exit strategy it is possible to get straight back into another trade.

This can happen say in the case where you were short and 2 bullish D1 candles kick you out then the very next 2 D1 candles both close red ... you are now back in the short again.

Yes there are plenty of examples where this has happened in the past and no doubt will occur into the future.

Looks quite solid so far.

As always the live test is what its all about so I'll post a live trade as soon as one sets up.

Also if a setup occurs say at the close of the D1 candle and it happens to be a Thursday meaning an entry on a Friday then perhaps think twice before entering the market.

Weekend gaps can create issues on many pairs and knock you clean out of the trade on Monday morning (something to think about).

So I would be looking at setups to play out with possible entries from Monday morning through to Thursday morning NOT on a Friday morning.

I am not suggesting that an early morning entry needs to be made as one might like to wait until London Open to unleash the setup into the market.

Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Nice observation.

Price tends to move in waves.

The pin bar or rejection at the 0/8 and extreme MMLs as well as some internal MML levels can provide some nice bounces to the next MML levels.

I have found that the internal MML can be a little tricky to get right.

The other point is to have a SL and TP that 'fits' with the MML settings currently being applied on the traded chart.

I'm going to share one more trade that I did today then I'm done! This one does not have to do with Murray Math but I hope you find it interesting.

I went short AUD/USD a few hours ago, here are a few charts showing engulfing bars all the way from 15 min to 1 day in a point of strong resistance. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You can see at the peak there where it created a halfway downward engulfing bar.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

After the 15 min engulfing bar the price continued to move down and created a 1 hour engulfing bar.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

THEN after the 1 hr engulfing bar price continued moving down for a 4 hr engulfing bar!!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Then you already know, after the 4 hr engulfing bar price continued to move down to create a daily pin bar!!

What does all this mean?  It means price continued to move down in a consistent methodical way and created candle stick formation after candle stick formation.

What else does this trade have going for it?  It is in a down trend, creating lower lows and lower highs.

Also on top of that you can see that the daily pin bar hit a strong point of previous support (flip to resistance?)

This is a rare set up and I may still lose this trade, but to me this is an A trade.

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Its the same old process if the trend continues and you get in at the start it looks fantastic.

There as been a lot of fuss over Strength Meters recently, never really interested me, thinking that they just follow price, with this in mind I have set my charts up in groups ie the Gbp pairs or the Eur Pairs etc etc then I have the setting as we know, now all I have added is a simple moving avg (5) as we are looking at a 4 bar cluster, all I am using it for is to gauge the overall strength of the main currency, what it shows to me is that Nzd is strong but the Eur is strong to, it looks as if it would have been better to have traded another pair eg overall weaker pair, think you get my drift

Is there a Murrey Math Indicator that has price alerts for each level? For example if I only want the +1/8 and +2/8 levels to give me alerts? Instead of the ones in between.

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Yes and the MA also laggs behind price.

Currency strength determination is a highly relative pursuit.

What we as traders never really know is how long a given currency will remain 'strong' or 'weak' !

Over what predicted time horizon? ... 5 minutes, 15 mins, 1 hour, the rest of the day or into the next month ... no-one knows.

The main reason is because 'world' events can change suddenly and before you know it the market is selling off a previously strong currency because war has been declared against their nation.

A drastic example, but less drastic events can also have a significant impact on the 'strength' or 'weakness' of a given currency at any given time.

The twitter account ramblings of a head of state for instance can move a currency and move it fast.

I have only ever really applied currency strength in very short term trade setups typically M1 and M5 or on lower tick charts of different platforms.

However, a keen observer of PA, bar by bar, candlestick formations and patterns and observing the momentum of price on a relatively bare chart can provide all the information from a technical perspective that a trader needs to get into or out of a position.

PA is king for a reason ... but so too is keeping in tune with market developments!

Good trading,

I used Pepperstone for your information.

Masterrmind.....

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Yes, I downloaded it as a mq4 file, sent a link to a guy in post 1014, the reason I have set mine up the way I have is that when I had the official Murrey End of Day software they both matched this way, having never seen a live intra day Murrey , i was not sure what to set each timeframe too, so just kept playing around until i got something that looked tradeable  now I had the thought of just leaving the 64 fixed and changing timeframes letting Xards777 do the rest and more than happy with what I am seeing.

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Yes once something is producing favorable results then its usually best not to change it.

My initial guess though is that both indicators apply the same formula since it is very very simple.

I would simply use the indicator but also plot out the D1 with 64 periods to get a feel for the general trading frame domain and mark out the highs and lows.

Looks good for the short side but as always the journey taken by price is rarely in a straight line so looking for some minor pullbacks but a continuation to the downside.

Lets see.

My future posts will now be numbered in this thread since the participation is woeful.

Best of trading to all concerned.

Agreed but it will be a sad loss for me as you are my Murrey Mate haha not the sweets named Murrey Mints

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Ha ha....

Lets see what the future brings shall we.

ps. 1 more short added to the EA pair.

Masterrmind.......

Must admit to warming to the 2up 2down method, been looking at more of his stuff over the weekend and to be honest cannot fault it, just have to be mindful how each broker treats Sunday

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Thought about re-entering on my pair, but sods law this happened whilst I was thinking (off a 60min) only scalping in same direction as Daily

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
At worst a longer term choppy market will start eating into your account but once that trend continues the gains are phenomenal.

Only need to get into a few of these type setups a week and the outlook is great.

Masterrmind........

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
I was wondering if you were going to short it again.

I thought about it myself but went for EURAUD instead.

EA - update shown on H1 Chart

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

About 100 pips a piece for each trade now.

SL locked in to protect trades and just above the 6/8 MML.

Good stuff my Murrey Mate, as you can see by my chart I seem to have half the size of your octaves, I am not going to post anymore Murrey Charts because the thread seems dead, just looking to trade with the cluster method, hope we can stay in touch some way

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
EA

+51.6 pips

+59.6 pips

Both trades closed out now via forced tightening of my stops.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

With a nasty pullback to the upside like what just occurred it left me little choice but to reduce my trailing stops rather quickly.

I may seek another short entry into this pair.

Masterrmind.........

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Simply check my profile and all will be revealed.

That's me done here.

All the best.

Masterrmind..........

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
Thanks Mastermind

i found the dashboard but it showed me all 0.0000 price

any idea why?

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Reload it again.

Then with it attached to a chart click through each of the different time periods and then back to the TF you want.

It should then reset and show current prices.

You might only need to go to 1 other TF and then back to your preferred TF.

Let me know how you get on.

ps. mql4 is not a very stable programming language and with all the never ending updates its a wonder any coder bothers with it at all....something to do with traders popularity I believe...haha.

Masterrmind........

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
thanks mastermind

combing through all tf works

btw i compared the value between the dashboard and MML indi. it seems to be different although i use the same tf

the dashboard period = 64 while the indi P=64, MM = 1440

any idea why it is different?

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
Make sure settings are identical.

The dashboard takes time to update.

Check using M1 and M5 TF and report back.

Masterrmind........

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
Hello, excuse my English.

What if day 7 is Saturday? Will it be used the day before or after?

I would like to know the best setting for weekly and monthly.

I liked the configuration of Masterrmind in M5 and M15.

Hi All

HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Hello,

I have read myself xx-days here across the different MML articles and I learned a lot. Many thanks to everyone who wrote and explained something about MML. It was a great help to me.

But so far I haven't found a program with which I can display the Circles of conflict.  Can anyone help me?

Many thanks

Hi Soho

Would you please upload indicators for this template ?

And if it's possible..please add an alarm to Quantum V2 indicator which you modified 3 years ago.

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
Hi!

I study the Murrey Math Lines. I want to understand why they are there. I want to edit them manually. I divided the fibonacci retracement into 8 parts. But I don't understand WHERE it goes on the graph? Can anyone help with this? THX

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
the Quantam Indicator doesnt show the boxes on XAUUSD, but for other pairs its showing, what makes it so and is there a solution to that

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
how you undarstanding that if price rejects from 7/8 to 5/8 then it must retrace on 6/8 so it means 2 down 1 up

but the problem is rotation need some kind of comfirmation that its really good time to sell there and opossite for buy

--- 帖子 #1065 ---

readed it but most of them i didnot get looks too hard for first time  would be nice if some kind of video it is  and also angles i was also thinking so much due gann was using it on his work, so if we had the 45 angle or 90 that it would help us a lot in my opinion

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Murrey only created End of Day software

Lots of really good guys have had a go at intra day but with no real success

Evert one see's Murrey in different ways , hence trades in there own style

The video in post one is very good and you could copy that style and win more than you lose

But I am trading and using different Murrey Numbers, that make sense to me

personally I could not just trade a 5 min as a stand alone method

I would have a longer lookback period to confirm an opinion

You understand what I call a (Chart shift) which is NOT re painting

Well I use that to tell me the TREND

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
thanks really intresting way to undarstand where price can go also its accepting gann angles by the way i am thinking for best entry to use orderflow whats your opinion about that? there is program called deltariver if you know for fx its free founded here 1 or 2 year ago and still working, so if i use stop bars poc bars for reversal and i will enter trade as low or as high for enter would be nice  i think my opinion, let me know your thinking about that way
