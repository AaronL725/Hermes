I no longer trade this anymore.... it gave me a great learning experience, but in the end it did prove to be unpredictable. thank you, RAZ 2/7/14

Since I use openoffice org, a freeware version of excel. I can e-mail you the ods. format which will quickly open up as a xls format. This will help you calculate your stops and take profits.

I draw my timezone in which I only take trades.

Here is possible trap

--- 帖子 #7 ---
might go south

--- 帖子 #8 ---
short eur 1.3485(entry point) took trade at 1.3486 stop loss 1.3499 take profit 1.3454

--- 帖子 #9 ---
out for loss, but hey that is how it rolls. looking for a new price trap

--- 帖子 #10 ---
couldnt post right away, had to reset price trap, and it broke it and got in 4 pips past the entry point. So holding long right now, but hope it hgets to 1.3540

--- 帖子 #11 ---
of course 3 pips from take profit.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
nvm it hit, so closed at take profit 1.3540

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Will follow with interest raz... what is nvm? Pete

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Got in same trade.... but a bit late cox try to understand the rules... however hit my TP still (demo)...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
When you see price rejection both up and down, those are your upper and lower levels. The area in between is the trap? Price rejection is when price moves quickly (say, more than a 45 degree angle) off of an upper or lower level. Have I got this right?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Yes my definition of price rejection is when hits an area, and quickely flys away from it. the trap is price between the upper and lower levels. So angle not so much, but just when price decides to run away from the area.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
nvm-nevermind. While I was posting that post, it hit TP

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Then, in order to be sure it's price consolidation, the trap has to be at least 11 minutes long and 9 to 23 pips deep. We wait for price to break out of the trap. If it breaks high, we go long. If it breaks low, we go short. Am I getting this right?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
yup!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I think I'm getting this. Now correct me if I'm wrong. On the chart, I have an upper and lower level, but still waiting for the breakout. Or is this trap too deep?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
you price trap is too wide and it has to have a at least a 'V' like rejection. I will show you on this pic

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I guess I should have better explained the 'V' like move. Sorry for that, but don't hesitate to ask any questions.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Sorry raz... this is out of the topic but I need help. Hi CalistogaKid... R u using MT4 for ur charting? How do u set the chart price each level in 75? Eg: 1.35000, 1.35075, 1.35150. Please snap a screen shot how to set it if possible. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I use Forex Trader Pro from forex.com . It sets the scale automatically according to how big the spread is between the highest and lowest prices for the number of candlestick I use in the chart.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
What would you do here raz, would you shift the hi-lo points to next set of arrows or stay with the first two? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pete

--- 帖子 #26 ---
holding long at 1.3519 looking for 1.3556 sl is 1.3502

--- 帖子 #27 ---
yeah, but in this case, you can get into the trade right after the fact. now it looks like I am about 11 pips from take profit again.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
If the trade has not traveled the full length to take profit, then go ahead and enter in when it comes back to the original entry point. Even if it is 20 mins afterwards.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Well as I was dressing this up for you guys. My take profit just hit. So not a bad night, 1 Loss 2 Wins and I am pretty beat for the night, so I am going to bed. I will see you guys next week

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Well Explained in just a couple of pages,Early days so see how I go,Thanks

--- 帖子 #31 ---
So it was nice to post this live with some of you traders. I appreciate everyone of you for following along. I trade this to make real money. I believe in it. It will take time for anyone to grasp this method. Because like most of you I have been watching the markets with indicators, so it does get a little tricky to watch price with out indicators. Secondaly I don't believe there is such a thing as a dumb question. I appreciate any input. So feel free to ask away. I will try to make my trades live as possible. As it may seem easy to me, it does take a trained eye to start to see the price rejections. I want to thank you guys for being here for my first night. As a quick note, I have traded this method live for the last 15 weeks straight. I have yet to have a losing week, but I have broken even 3 weeks. SO better to break even then to lose. Well I will be on next week, and if you have any questions hope to help anyone I can.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
partly because there isn't much to method, and I am only trading one pair. But it gets easier over time. Spotting a price trap gets easier over time. Thanks for the input.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
This is a case where the trap has not been out long enough for price to act accordingly. So you void and look to build a better Price trap

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Sorry guys. I was about to turn my monitors off, and I saw this price trap build and actually got a nice signal right before my personal session is over. So I have limits set got in at 1.3541 Stop loss is 1.3554 Take Profit 1.3512

--- 帖子 #35 ---
So 1 loss, two wins. If I lose this, well I am still up money wise. !

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Sweeet

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Wow... gave it a try. It works... Awesome!Thank you for sharing. Practice makes perfect..I'll be tagging alone with you...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Excellent system and to think that its being done off the 1 minute. Made 50 pips in total trading a long and than a short. The short is still going. Big THANX to you Raz.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Raz this system looks great. I am based in the UK so my trading time using this will be from 7am to 10am which is perfect. It means that I can trade this for an hour before taking the kids to school,then still have some time to trade before leaving for work. Over the weekend I will look back at previous days to practice identifying the traps. Thanks again and have a great weekend. Heath

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Raz, thank you for this method. Do you enter immediatly after the break or you wait the price to came back and tests the level?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
In Recap Rule number 3 I think its immediately after break and close of candle outside line

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Just letting you know that I use almost the same technique that you are using for a year and a half now with success when used consistently bad trades or good trades. At the end of the month, it has been in the plus side. However I still use an old abandoned indicator called carmen. Anyway, the developer abandoned this indicator, but i still use it for real-time confirmation. It is very difficult to use and understand how to use it, so forget i said anything about carmen. Just understanding this trapping and resistance methodology is sufficient to be successf.ul using this system. If traders just give themselves a try, they will see results. Warning: this technique will eat your account alive if you don't put stop loss. Thanks a lot Raz for introducing this to forexfactory. I thought I was the only one that uses this.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Ok thanks

--- 帖子 #44 ---
What a way to take wake up. I get up, turn my monitor on and bam I have that trade hit the winning take profit. So to recap the last trade, here we go.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
so to answer yes, you want to enter right after that candle closed. However try to enter in as close as you can to the entry line(lower level)

--- 帖子 #46 ---
It was nice to actually post live examples last night, so most of you would'nt think that I cherry picked some charts for you. It was nice to finish out 3 winning trades and show a 1 loss trade. So even in such a short trading window(3 hours) you can really have some decent activity. Now just because I choose to trade the 3 hours that I have it set for, does not mean that it will only work during that time frame. This is just when I choose to trade it. Once you get the feel for it you will realize that this will work for ranging as well as trending markets, because you are taking entries only where price chooses to go!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Perfect! hopefully next week will be a good one!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks for sharing. Will try.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I took the same one last night, but my runner grinded it all the way down for a greater profit. I usually look at 1 hour to see if the resistance zone if more valid. After making the marks in 1 min, I blow i up to 1Hr chart and it shows me a better perspective. Cheers

--- 帖子 #50 ---
very nice input. Good to see that you can imply your experience to make it profitable for yourself.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
My other trade today. Raz, can you check if this is valid according to your methodology? Also, 1 Hr shows more valid at the bottom part of the trap (support/resistance levels) I went long and it is still running! Raz, I am sorry if I am bringing up the 1hr TF chart. I know it is not a part of your methodology. I am just merely saying that this I incorporate 1 1 min chart so i can see a better wide range TF picture. I'll stop posting the 1 hr chart from now on.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
No need to apologize. I would rather anyone who chooses to trade any method, to make it their own. Secondly if you feel comfortable getting confirmation with a 1 hour timeframe. so be it. It will not change how I trade this method. I notice your chart, the price trap may be a little bit wide, but it is ok. I pretty sure we can see that price is making higher highs and higher lows. So it does confirm your long. I am getting ready for my daily job. So I am not trading it now, but it looks like it will clear a nice high for you. Where did you enter in at?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Anyway I am out at 1.3540 for 40 pip profit valid or not. (in 1 hr TF it shows that there is a lot of resistance there.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
hi there do you trade this only on EURUSD or have you tried it on other pairs ,I know that Raz has only been consistand on EURUSD trading this method ,just wanted to know if you trade all the major pairs thanks

--- 帖子 #55 ---
well this way past my trading time zone, but I notice a nice setup. So see if it something to give a shot

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I have 2 other systems that I am using. But for this system, I trade EUR/USD only. I find this system to suit better with this pair. I tried GBP/USD about 6 months ago, it got so confused and I got burnt. So, since then I been trading this type of Raz' system on EUR/USD pair only. Maybe, I will demo the other pairs when I get a chance.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
ok not going to post pic, but it did break the bottom level, so we have a entry at 1.3525 Stop loss at 1.3544 Take Profit at 1.3484 This is small risk, because I usually dont trade during this time. But I figure I would give it a try, outside my trading time zone

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Okay, I shorted also @ 1.3523. I'll get out for a 15 pips profit here. I hope

--- 帖子 #59 ---
good move Raz , I have only opend a small position on here to was able to catch it at 1.3528 ,see how it goes as its friday and this time of the day it can be bit slow

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Okay i got out @1.3513. Too risky for me, RAz. The bottom resistance/support is not clear in 1hr TF.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Raz, When you get a chance, can you elaborate more on your SL and TF using your calculator. I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
just got back from dropping my dog at the groomers. I see price is going south, not quite there yet. So still have a lot of work to get there, looking for 1.3484. It probably will take another hour or so. As for the trading calc, it is just a tool that I use to calculate lot size and stop loss and take profit really fast. message me your e-mail and I will happy to e-mail it to you. It's in a freeware from of excel which is xls. format

--- 帖子 #63 ---
This is what it looks like. I fill only the blue areas, and it does the math for me as for entry point and stop loss and take profit. Just to simply the madness when price is moving fast

--- 帖子 #64 ---
well price broke through and hit 1.3484... so not bad for catching one during my off time

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Raz, You you mind down loading your spreadsheet? Ron

--- 帖子 #66 ---
it isn't a recoginized file on FF, so you have to pm with your e-mail address. and I will shoot it to you

--- 帖子 #67 ---
so recap on my last winning trade.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hello Raz! Congratulations, I have been watching all your today's posts, very nice work. I am new in this forum and I am trying to learn from your posts. Could you plz explain your Price Trap Calculator when you get a chance, how can I get my onw. plz answer. take care, sevenskies

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Ok now I am done for the week. Please do not hesitate to ask any questions. I am willing to help because I have found so many people on this forum so helpful. I know it was a good night to open this method up, because it showed so many winning trades. However it does have it's moments where it seems you do so much just to break even. That is why I have the bonus pips, so at least if I win 1 and lose 2 I gain something. Just something that I did for myself. Well next week I hope to provide more trades for you guys to see.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
This system has worked again! Congrats! Too bad I bailed out too soon. I still use this type of system too conservatively. Anyways, I am up 50 pips so far this Friday. Thanks

--- 帖子 #71 ---
No Worries! Believe I have been there so many times before. You aren't confident as I am with this system as anyone should be. So if you feel it is time to take your profit then do so. That is why I strongly urge you trade very small lots or demo to start off to see the full potential of this system. There are many times where price gets within 2 pips of take profit, and reverses all the way back to loss. However that is how it goes sometimes. Anyhow I appreciate your input

--- 帖子 #72 ---
the price trap calc is just a tool to calculate the entry points as well as stop losses and take profits. It will also self calculate the lot size depending as where you set your risk %, and account balance. Profit pips and loss pips are also calculated. It just simplies my ability to make a quick entry when price breaks areas. So I have the lot size set, and entry point set, and know where to place my stop loss and take profit limit orders.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I can't open the spreadsheet with Excel 2003. Is there anyway that you can convert it to 2003 and resend the file...I appreciate it

--- 帖子 #74 ---
thanks for the reply Raz, can I make my own this calculator. How to get it. Is there any website?? plz reply. thanks

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I will try at work. I have excel there. Then send it to you

--- 帖子 #76 ---
try this attachement. I converted it online. You may have to move the cells width out to make the numbers fit, but should work

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Nevermind...I figured it out. I opened it with my google account email and saved it locally. And now I am able to open it. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Raz! Does numbers work automatically??? I've seen your xl chart. How you put the numbers in. plz explain. thanks, sevenskies

--- 帖子 #79 ---
you have to manually input your the account balance risk%, and the upper and lower levels. The excel cells that are blue is what you make your manual adjustments. The rest calculates on it's own. The xls chart is just a tool to help calculate everything very fast, but isn't really needed on the method. I see that you have 3 post on FF. Which is ok, but how new are you to forex in general? I recommed if you haven't tried it, but go through the school of babypips.com That is heaven sent. Before trading any method of any sort

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Right now I am in my office, I got to go now but I will let you in details about me, I hope you will not mind. Anyway thanks for reply, take care, sevenskies

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Well thought, well explained, well illustrated system and a very nice topic-starter too! raz, you're the man! You've made my day! And my weekend too!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
glad to here. I am here help.... as so many have helped before. I am a self taught trader through many trials and errors. However it looked real good last night and this morning. So it will be interesting to see how it goes next week. Take the good with the bad

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I never will mind. So feel free to ask anytime

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Everybody loves the thread but so far I'm the only one who rated it. Come on, guys!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thank you Raz, you made my days. I'm a new a "poster" on FF as you can see, but have been religiously reading every thread I could think of on FF to find a methodology that is as SIMPLE as possible. Am not a newbie on trading and got burnt alot of times. This is the first time I came across such a simple method. Am still trying it on demo and it has worked well. I understand there's no Holy Grail in fx, that's normal. I'm grateful that you post yr Excel calculator on this thread as I can't pm you. One last question, anybody can tell me?... can I rate this thread, as I am still a new "poster"? If so, how do I go about it? If I can't, then Raz and Raz followers, know that I'd love to give it a 5 stars! You deserve it Raz! Thank you.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I got back from my work today. I thank you for your support. As time goes on this method will get easier to adapt too. I try to answer all post that I can. As for right now I would say that if I have not, please feel free to post or pm me and I will do my best to answer all.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I'll start testing the system this Sunday night. Thank you, raz!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Raz! Thx for this Great Job!!! Can't wait until tomorrow night to start testing... You state to wait the price to go back to the entry point and i think its the right way to enter... Are you: 1) Entering with a Limit Order when the price touches your entry line?, or 2) Do you wait the price to "re-enter" into the trap and then you enter the trade with a Stop order? Thx Again!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
UllenSentalu, I don't know whether the junior members have the right to vote, you have to try. When you look at the right upper corner of the page, right below the pages' numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6) you see the word " Rating " and 5 small yellow "stars". Click on it and you'll see the list of options (from 5 stars to one) - choose five stars and click on the button "Vote now"

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thanks Fav. It doesn't work. Guess, I need more postings to be able to do so., I guess. Raz, know this... I'm very grateful for your efforts! Merci!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
You can chance the price to go further back behind the entry point, to gain extra pips. But however I enter manually when I see the price come back and touch the entry point line. I never chance it because sometimes it will take off and goto to take profit and miss out my chance to gain on the trade. You can set a limit order, but I just do it manually. Think about this for example. I am always going to risk 2% per trade at the most. So if I was in an example like this We are going long and price is coming back to entry point, and let's say upper level is 1.3460 lower level is 1.3450 Therefore by my rules the entry point to go long is 1.3460 and stop loss is 1.3450 -2% take profit is 1.3483 +4.6% If price shoots back and I enter in at 1.3456. Still my entries are as Stop Loss 1.3450 Take Profit 1.3483 So in theory I am risking stop loss risking -1.2% take profit is +5.4%. So yes getting behind the entry point is a bonus in two ways, less risk and more gain. Risky but if you feel price is going to goto center of trap then hit it up there.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
to raz, I thank on relative honesty give knowledge that is useful to all of us

--- 帖子 #93 ---
This seems similar to bollinger break out?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
In one and a half hour I made 38.7 pips. Since it was the "slow" Australian session, I exited the first time manually, when I saw that the trend is over and got 18.7 pips. And the second time I set a small TP 20 pips and it got hit, and, of course, the price went much further, it would hit the right-according-to-the-author TP... Of course during London/NY I will set the TP exactly like raz says. EURUSD sell at 00:33 1.35107 closed at 01:12 1.34920 Profit +18.7 pips EURUSD buy at 01:22 1.35042 closed at 01:35 1.35242 Profit +20.0 pips

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi Raz....Do you just use the body of the candles to form the perameters of the consolidation band? T

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hey RAZ. Please tell me if is this setup ok. Edit: get long 3424, stop 3409, target 3457, trap 15 pips Regards PH

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Maybe it was a very good evening, maybe just "beginner's luck" , but altogether I made 82 pips.I think I'd better stop and take a good breath because I got too excited!

--- 帖子 #98 ---
What I am looking for to set my upper and lower levels is price rejection, you need to see where price travels at it's further point whether it be a pin needle or even a full candle bar, and then it quickly rejects against it. If you read back into the earleir post I show picture demonstrations on price rejection, and giving that 'V' like move with in the trap

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hmm lil tough to say, but I see that price does settle well in the trap, however i can't tell how wide your trap is? It does reject well from the bottom level, but it does looks valid to me. Where did you enter long at?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
GJ, made some money during the asian session nice!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
well session about to open up. So I look for new traps here, because anything that happened in the past is meaningless. Let's see where price is going to go

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Good method Raz, simple and straight forward. Would you mind putting up a screen shot, as of now, to get an idea of your beginning of your session Much appreciated. Good trading day to all! Peter

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Raz, the reason I'm asking this is to copare your broker start time with my broker start time. I'm with Alpari UK. Thanks again Peter

--- 帖子 #104 ---
this is what I am loking at right now, I dont have a trap quite set yet but I will try and let you know asap when I do

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Raz, do you have a minimum or maximum range for the trap size? What trap size has worked best for you?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
please read post 1. It is critical to understand how I came about this method. I am not trying to sound rude or cocky, but if you are seriously interested in this so simple of a method, I would appreciate you read the first post.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thanks Raz.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I voided this trap setup, and will look for a better trap

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Sorry if this sounds dumb, but for the sake of clarity, can just explain what you mean by 'close is too soon' Thanks Peter

--- 帖子 #110 ---
No need to apologize peter. But I usually wait at least 11 mins of price action to occur with in the price trap before I take a valid entry. I start counting minutes after the very first price rejection. At this point price isn't settling down long enough within the price traps for me to take any entry at this point.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Edit: get long 3424, stop 3409, target 3457, trap 15 pips. It was a looser

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I assume this is what screen-time has taught you. No need to reply. Peter

--- 帖子 #113 ---
well that is probably why I dont trade it during the non eur/uk/us session. Sorry to see that, hopefully tonight I can show a few good examples. Thus far still looking for a trap

--- 帖子 #114 ---
there is definite price consolidation going on, but it is too wide to take advantage of. So may have to wait till open of UK session to see if we can take advantage

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Raz, thx for sharing your method. I never tried trading 1min before as I always felt it was too fast for my brain. Gonna give your ideas a shot tho and wondering about the live skype room u mentioned in first post - is it up and running yet?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
yes I am raz_4xpips add me and I will invite you in

--- 帖子 #117 ---
ok UK session, let's see if I can make a trap.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
price trap is set, upper level 1.3430 and lower level 1.3410

--- 帖子 #119 ---
My trap was a little earlier raz, with a 22 pip channel... Attached Image (click to enlarge) pete

--- 帖子 #120 ---
So i am waiting to see what i can trade. Trap is 20 pips wide

--- 帖子 #121 ---
well lets see where it may go, the longer the price sits in the trap.. The better!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
just add u in skype

--- 帖子 #123 ---
reset trap to 1.3433 and lower level is 1.3410 still

--- 帖子 #124 ---
here is what I am waiting for

--- 帖子 #125 ---
most of us are in skype now, feel free to come and join if you like.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I went long at 1.3434. it looks like it will stop me out, but sl is 1.3410 and take profit is 1.3482

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Raz, no comment to make on your method, but only to suggest a way to use the MT4 Fibonacci Tool to highlight your levels, please refer to the screenshot; Levels are 0, 1, -2 and 3 , you can put any message you want in the Description, hope that helps, good luck

--- 帖子 #128 ---
ohh I will look at it, I am not good with MT4 at all, but I will try and figure it out, ty sir!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
still holding long at 1.3434 and looking for 1.3482. So this probably will take into past my trading session. So I will goto sleep and hope I hit the TP, or it will just SL

--- 帖子 #130 ---
this is the trade that I am in right now

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Trade looking a little better, but will have to see if hit goes all the way to 1.3482. It looks like it will take at least another 90 mins or so, but we shall see

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Valid setup. I took that trade, Raz. Clearly indicated in 1Hr also.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I took the same trade, and set the same TP, but got nervous and got out manually with 38 pips. I wish I could be that calm and cool as you, raz!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Great! pips taken although my poor entry at 3447 Regards PH

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I am out here @ 1.3490 for +55 pips profit! Looking for another setup. Runner is still going. Trying to get out at @1.3537

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I feel the same way. I usually trade this type of system conservatively as what I have been in the past 1 1/2 year incorporating the 1hr TF. But I am still trying to be as brave as RAZ. When a valid setup/entry is found in 1 min I look at the 1 hr TF then base my decision from what I see also in 1 HR, so I don't take also traps in 1min. Anyway, when I take the trade, I get out between 10-30 pips, then I have a runner that I let it grind all the way but with BE SL. It's been working for me. You may want to try this until you are comfortable with Raz' system.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Target got hit @ 1.3537 . This is one of my best days with this system. First lots: +55 pips profit. Runner lots: +102 pips profit. I maybe done for the day. But I am still looking for another uptrend setup here. We'll see.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
This is not a trap. The depth is not there yet and the length is kind of wide also. I am looking for a breakout to the upside/downside, but I don't see a trap. In the past I tried mini traps (only 10-15 pips depth) setup ... with only 7 pips reward but the result was erratic, so I abandoned that concept...But I would like to reexplore that possibility again, may be lower the reward to 5 pips only.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
This was the mini trap I used to take to get the 7 pips profit. Just wondering if you have looked into this?

Hi Raz &amp; friends, Pls commend if this is a valid setup? The 'V' may not look ideal.... If the setup is valid, any concern being hovering above round no. 1.3500 TQ

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I thought in was a mini trap, but is it is actually a valid setup according to Raz' system. I would have taken it for small profit, but did not (my 1hr TF hasnt confirmed it...my system). We need Raz' input on this one.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
definetly, valid, and and a good close to go south.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
If would have hit our target

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Well typical Monday's, are a little slower then usual but it did hit my TP. So can't complain

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Well according to the entries, yes I see price is sitting at 1.3470. So yes it would have hit take profit if you had shorted it. Sorry a little tired right now just woke back up.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
It would take my a while to fully gain confidence in your trap setup, Raz. It just that I have been incorporating the 1min with the 1Hr so many months, and my mind has been programmed to do so.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
it's ok. It just takes a little time getting used to it. But gj

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Excellent, I know last night we were a little worried about where you got in, but happy to see it worked out for you!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
fullly understand that

--- 帖子 #150 ---
hey I like the look of your lots calc ,is tht on excel ,thanks

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I just added that excel calc to my first post. So if you want it go ahead and dl from there.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Contact Raz...he would email you the spreadsheet calc.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi Raz Just a quick question if I may, lets say we are in a trade as a result of a breakout from a price trap, but before price hits our target another price trap occurs, do we ignore it or do we add another trade giving us 2 open positions.? Hope this makes sense. Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I usually add more and if it goes the other way from my first entry, I exit all. This is a good question for Raz.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Currently trade I am in: Long I call it mini trap (if you don't mind)

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Looking at the rule though: " Second thing to keep in mind is that the price levels, or what I call the price trap has to be a minimum of 9 pips to 23 pips wide." Raz, If that is the case, then it should be a valid trap according to your system??

--- 帖子 #157 ---
My entry was 1.3489. Target hit @ 1.3517 and out for 28 pips profit My runner is still going.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
GJ! I am at my work comp, so I have no access to my charts. However good to see that you are making it work, and adapting what works best for you

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I knew at one point someone would ask this. I have seen many times where I set a trap, and get a confirmed closed. Two things will happen if another trap is created either it will be in the same direction of the current position, so what do I do then? Do I add more to my trade, and set my new SL and further out my new TP? The Second thing that happens is that a new traps forms and actually closes against the direction of my current position. So do I close it out with a small profit/short loss and go for the opposite direction? Well two answer both; I would have to say I have seen this many times in my backtest and forward testing, and I have learned that it is about 50/50. Sometimes it works, sometimes it costs. I personally don't like to take a ton trades in one night, 4 to 5 would be ever be the most. I like to keep it simple and grab what I originally targeted for. From my own experience is that daily swings aren't forever, so once you are in a trade then go for what you originally set out to do even if it closes against you. I have toyed with it some many times that it a lot of cases my biggest causes of loss or giving up easy profit is because I am either hesistating my intial decision or I am trying to gain too much. That is why I try to keep it short and sweet and grab my money fast.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
By the way Forexforex, is this a live account or demo?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
It is live, Raz. I have 2 other systems that I am concurrent watching. Your system, as i said, i have been using it for 1 year and a half now with consistent profit month after month. I was surprised and happy when I saw your system you posted in the forum because it is almost similar to mine (I use the 1 hr TF for confirmation--conservative style). Now I am learning more about your system which is more aggressive and I find it profitable so far. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
GJ, and as trader out there with real money knows it isn't easy risking money into unknown territory, so it will take time. However I have made 25% to 30% gains per week on this method. I definetly risk quite a bit, sometimes a lot in certain situations. So I know it works for me, but I appreciate how you are using what feels right for you. Because demo is demo, fake money has no emotions tied to do it. Nothing wrong with using a demo account. However with live money you can understand the feeling of happiness or crap! Lol but way to keep it rolling, make PIPS!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I am out on my runner. Initial entry: 1.3489 exit 1.3505 for 16 pips. I exited because another trap was developing and it went against the direction of my first entry. Eventhough the 1hr TF is still a bull. I am just tired and ready to call it a day. Not bad anyway for 16 pips on my runner. Anyway, I already made 28 pips from my first entry. I am done for the day here. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Great Job forexforex I'm short on that trap waiting for my pips at 3467 GL PH

--- 帖子 #165 ---
thanks Raz will DL the excel calc ,just what I need for quick trades ,and following your system with interest

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hi GL, I am actually done for the day. Very profitable day for me. But, it was a valid trap! i hope you get your exit at this time of the day. 4x4x

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I am back from my quick rest. Okay an hour later, this is what we see. I am waiting for the breakout to the upside for me to enter here.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Instead, it just touched the upper part of the trap and then went south. Just watching here.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
forexforex, I hope you don't mind if I ask: why upside? H-1's stochastics, Heiken Ashi and (I think) PA too show downtrend . P.S. I set up the same trap, took a short trade but got out very quickly with 8.4 pips. P.P.S. I do know that raz doesn't confirm with H-1 and just goes where the price goes, but right now I'm not that confident as he is.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
The overall trend is downtrend. But it would not go further south. There is more opportunity at the upside if it breaks out. I am done trading today unless this goes to the upside. There's a lot of fakes at this time of the day and I don't want to take that risk. If it goes south then good, but I am not taking it.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Thank you, forexforex, now I got it!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
You are welcome... That's why i still look at the macro picture to avoid some fakes (well, it works for me being a conservative trader as myself)

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Here is an anomaly setup, but the overall picture is still a trap. I am not sure how Raz would see it but I took the bait. I have few pips to spare here. i got in @ 1.3479

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Using the Raz' spreadsheet, it shows that TF is 1.3550. That would be nice if it goes all the way there. I will TF @ 1.3509 instead, and let my runner goes all the way with SL near the BE. We'll see how this this will pan out

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Another trap developing. I may bail if it goes south here, and not touch it if it goes north.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I am out @ 1.3509 for 30 pips profit....But i still have my runner working.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Good job today making some pips. I will be on in about 3 hours or so and will try to see if we can have another profitable nite!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Back from eating out, gonna wait till the hour close and then look for trap setups. I am pretty impressed with how many people have jumped right into the skype room between last night and tonight. I really didn't expect too many people to be interested in this method being that it has no indicators and trades off of the 1 min TF, and just one currency. However that is what I like to trade, keep it simple. I know between last Friday and Monday, I have posted live trades and with good success. Some of you have been calling it the 'holy grail' Now listen.....things look good, and yes it takes discipline to get good. However I don't believe there is a 'holy grail' of any sort. You as the trader can make any method, or combinations of method togther and call it what you want. I know from my years of trading various things that I can actually make something work well for me. Now it maybe different for you, or the next trader. However if you take what you can learn from this method and make it fit what work's best for you, then by all means you have taken that step to understanding that possibilities of being a successful trader. Far too many times I have tried to be exact 100% what other traders were trying to teach or display. I just found myself to be very dissappointed in what I ended with. So I don't bash on anyone who wants to incorporate indicators, or various other methods of confirmation. It shows me that you have learned to be comfortable to what you have taught yourself to understand on various points of view. Ultimately that is what I want people to gain from this. Make it work best for you, and if I can help... I will do my very best. At this point I am very set on how I trade this, and will continue to show what I am seeing, and hopefully make some damn pips!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi raz, I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to skype, if it's ok I'd like to participate, but how do I do it? pete

--- 帖子 #180 ---
first of all you have to setup an account with skype, and then add me as a contact. It's a veriosn of instant messenger, like msn or yahoo or aim. But what I like about skype is that it records the chat history.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Try skype youtube

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Thaks raz, done the dload, will do, thanks! pete

--- 帖子 #183 ---
the trap is choppy, and very sloppy

--- 帖子 #184 ---
still no trap set yet, price is jumping inconsistently

--- 帖子 #185 ---
May have to wait for UK session to get good traps

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi, RAZ Don't you think tis trap is all right pls ? Regards BBF

--- 帖子 #187 ---
i rather see a little more consistent trap set. Too choppy right now to trap. So will have to see where it traps better, just my opinion

--- 帖子 #188 ---
see if you would have longed. Then you would have been shorted out for a loss. So again waiting for a better setup

--- 帖子 #189 ---
[11:44:56 PM] Michael Sargent: (beer)we need to understand the trade that we do not take that would cost us money, would need a 2X winning trade to make it up. So if you make a decision to avoid trading at the cost of avoiding potential loss, you actually are trading effectively

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi Guys, My runner since yesterday is still running. Never hit my TF and SL. The market is sloppy. I have to look further back from yesterday to make out what's going on. No trades for me yet today

Possible setup

--- 帖子 #193 ---
trap is set at 1.3549 upper level lower level is 1.3527 shorted at 1.3529. So looking for a close at 1.3480 So if you want to demo or give it a try, price is in the trap right now, so you can still get in, but I am in and holding for a short push south for a close

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I'm in too raz, same trap levels, but shorted at 1.3522 pete

--- 帖子 #195 ---
ok well you are further down, but let's get there together. I posted most of this very quickly in the skype room. And few other traders got in 8 to 9 pips behind the entry point. So that is some BONUS PIPS!

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Looks like it is making a rally, but I am going to hold my original position. Short at 1.3529 By the way I have made two rooms, since one of the rooms got really big fast. We now have Price Trap Active Trading Price Trap Open Discussion

--- 帖子 #203 ---
open up a free account, and add me when u can, and I will invite you in. We have close to about 30+ memembers in the rooms now, so it's growing fast

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Slow!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I entered at 1.35220 too. But I made my take-profit only 30 pips, so it already got hit. As raz said earlier, we should learn from this method and make it fit what works best for us. For me TP 30 pips for majors and 35 pips for crosses works very good, I feel very comfortable with it, but if I set bigger TP, I don't feel comfortable and I usually get out manually (like I did yesterday) long before the TP get hit. My daily goal is 60 pips, so if I get 30 pips with this method at London open, I can always get another 30+ pips even by scalping.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
GJ Fellow trader

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I am out also with only 30 pips. Raz, I am trying to figure out how you got in earlier @1.3529

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Pending "sell stop" order or a very good reaction?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
i just got in a little behind it, but I am off to bed. Very tired. So another night with just one setup. Most of this posting was done in skype, but I am still holding my short. Almost all the traders in skype made good pips. So anyhow see you guys next session. this probably will hit in a hour so Looking to close at 1.3480(it did miss my close by 2 pips, but I am holding it)

--- 帖子 #210 ---
the candle had closed @3519 and then the price pulled back and he entered the trade @3529

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thanks Raz

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi raz, I'm a little curious as to why you did not take the trap just after the frankfurt open (it would have resulted in a loss anyway), were certain other conditions not met? How are we to recognize an invalid trap because both trap size and minute length were met. Many thanks pete (bagged some nice pips tonight tho) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #213 ---
from what i experimented it's better to put your entry (short or long) 3 pips above or bellow the where you think is the trap... this help to avoidfalse signal

--- 帖子 #214 ---
As any system, this system will fail, and that is a perfect example. Now remember, fallowing Money Management, TP is always 2*stop + 3 pips, so if the system is right 50% of the time, u have about 75% accuracy on returns. Looks like a great system to me. Regards PH

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I don't agree with that because RAZ always wait for a pullback for an entry. Sometimes u get about 3:1 ratio on your entry. If u do that u are playing a breakout strategy and u wont get the best entry to the trade. Just my 0.02€ Regards PH

--- 帖子 #216 ---
this is my 2nd trade today. i took this trap long and got me only 15 pips. i thought it was just a mini trap, but it shot up all the way.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
this time the resistance turned be the support. you will see it clearer in 1hrtf

--- 帖子 #218 ---
currently looking for possible setup

--- 帖子 #219 ---
i just closed my runner from yesterday = +104 pips profit

--- 帖子 #220 ---
i got in short @ 1.3574 . I am not comfortable with this one, but just following what i see. I got some pips to spare

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Any-one notice this trap?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Retrace to carry down perhaps.

Just got in!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Momentum seems to be lacking at present. Let's wait and see.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
It still hasn't hit the tp, so when it bounced back up to 1.36320, I went ahead and got in. Some days you just get lucky, I guess. Now, I just hope it doesn't turn on me.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Ok as for last night, I think most of the guys took profits when it got close, I didn't and help my posisition. Well like the market, we never where it wants to go. I felt that it would eventually push south, and it didnt and I loss. Oh well... Life goes on, and even though I was +1 pip from closing out, this is how it goes. So on to the next trading session tonight for me. Good job last night for those who made lots of pips in trading.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I'm still not sure of myself enough to take the risk. So, when I noticed it hitting support @ 1.3600, I went ahead and closed it out. But, I made an easy 17 pips. So, I'm not complaining.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Looks like a good setup is building right here.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I'm still not reall sure of myself here.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I went ahead and trusted my own judgement. I still wasn't brave enough to ride it all the way to t/p. But, I did close it out for a 23 pip profit. Go figure.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi Raz, First of all, please, excuse me for my English. English is not my native language. Thank you very much for sharing. Your trading method impressed me with its simplicity, beauty and logical. This is exactly what I was looking for. I like Prica Aktion, but I always something missing. Now, everything fell into place. P. S. Is it possible to join to your live trading room in skype? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
CalistogaKid, I "was home", but I was busy with good ol' EURUSD. Scalped the hell out of her!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi Guys! Firts of all, I apologize for my poor english. Long story short... I opened a demo account, went from 50.000 to 100.000 in 2 weeks or so. "This can't be as difficult as people says!!! I'm going to make a bunch of dollars here!"... Next Steps...: 1) Open a live Account 2) Deposit Funds 3) Read some Threads 4) Start loosing Money 5) Continue loosing Money 6) Lost my Money... I found this thread a little too late to save that money, but I like the method a lot! It's simplicity and the Raz way to live it... so I opened a demo account, changed the broker, the interface, the mindset and here I am with my first trade. I Saw the trap (blue), counted the bars and entered... While I was confident of the Raz confidence (but also praying for my first trade), prices went up and down, and before hit my TP they created another Trap (red)... What would you do? Add to the position? Open a new position? Nothing? Panic as I did? Well few minutes later Prices went to my TP, I closed everything and came home. I hope to be here for a long time... and learn from all of you enough to have happy tradings! CU Guys! (Thx Raz)

--- 帖子 #235 ---
ok from what i understood it was riding the breakout but reread the thread and you are right here is my last trade entered just before 2nd bounce http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/7803/98614457.gif

--- 帖子 #237 ---
As many of you know, the skype is room and running. I am seriously amazed how many people have turned out. Lot's of knowledge in a room. I will be back in about 3 hours or so. I appreciate all the good remarks, and wHAT THE!!! All 5 stars, holy cow you guys are generous out there. Easy method to learn, and easy to make your own.

Entered 5 minutes ago at 1.35854. So far I'm up 19 pips.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
My TP 30 pips already got hit. That was fast! Thank you, raz! Right now I test it live, but with a small lot size (0.01). I think, I'll test it 3 more weeks and then I'll go with a normal lot size. I also want to try AUDUSD and USDCAD, somehow I think this system will be good for them too.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I want to clarify this post for those out there. I have had made weeks with 25-30%, but I average a 14.76% per week average. Some weeks I have broken even

--- 帖子 #244 ---
gj, Let's see what those do for you!

can we enter now? or too late?

Good time to get in now Raz?

Longed at 1.3618, and I know it got close to TP, but I am going for it here TP 1.3644 SL 1.3605

--- 帖子 #252 ---
sitting close to SL, but hasn't stopped out yet. So looking for long push here, but who knows. I have my limits set and I will probably goto sleep soon, and hopefully wake up with a win. However if it loses oh well, I made good money on earlier trade, this one is being a bit stubborn.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I think it's already hit the SL. Shall we make another trade to sell it if it broke the lower level clearly?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
closed loss, So not a bad night 4% gain on first win, and -2% loss on second, so netted a good night

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Entered short 1.36033 Probably I shouldn't, one good trade per London Open is good enough for me. But I'm testing...

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Exited manually with +6 pips. Better be safe than sorry!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
==================== why I ask this is because in the first two trades in this thread, RAZ went short first, and hit SL and then went long for the same trap. So I am a little bit confused.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
No, it was a different trap, a new trap. I set every trap individually and look at them individually, without considering the previous trades. But this short trade was my mistake, the price started ranging, so I decided to get out with a small profit (+6 pips) and not to allow the trade to become a loss.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
hi forexforex what is a runner ? i you trading this system on the 1 hour timeframe ? if not, then why do you use the 1 hr charts, what do you look for there ? can you give a chart example... thanks

--- 帖子 #260 ---
forexforex, I wanted to ask the same question. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
hi raz what do you mean by invalid price rejection ? you say the depth of the trap has to be from 9 - 22 pips. so if its under 9 pips or over 22 pips, is that not a valid setup ? i think the key to this system is knowing where to set the trap, i.e. having the right trap levels.. good

--- 帖子 #262 ---
25 minutes ago I entered long 1.36236, the TP 30 pips got hit in 10 minutes. So today altogether I got 66 pips, two trades were successful, TP got hit, and I got out of a bad one with a small profit 6 pips. Life is good!

--- 帖子 #263 ---
you trade exactly like me. always playing it safe and grabbing those pips ! he he, found someone like me at last..... well that is indeed the best way to trade ! which pair did you trade ?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I'm sure you're NOT like me: people at the "Trading Made Simple" thread say that I have a very nasty temper! With this system I trade only EURUSD so far. Planning to try AUDUSD and USDCAD. With other systems I trade EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, EURJPY, GBPJPY.

I saw a short one (1.3661) ten minutes ago, I decided not to take it. Maybe I was wrong, it goes down nicely, more than 10 pips so far. I would probably take it, but we have some important news at 8:30...

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I have since taken a short at 1.3648 and retraced a little, but is moving down now as I'm typing. Peter

a short from Petes 36627 wudda been sweet...26 pips.. Getting to like this method very much...

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Yes, it is moving down nicely, with 1.3661 it would already hit my 30 pips TP. Well, we live and we learn! Probably the next time I will be thinking not about the news, but about the system's rules!

Nice one Pete...you wudda netted a sweet 26 pip...and still dropping

Hi guys, 72 pips total for me today, just scalping 20-30pips each setup.. Sorry, I am not comfortable with the spreadsheet yet. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Did anybody take 1.36392 long 9 minutes ago? I set up the trap and I saw this entry but it was 5 minutes before the news, so it was too risky for me.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yes, it was a fake signal, now she is going all the way down, broke the lower level of the trap. Well, it was a good day with 66 pips for me. I think it's enough for today.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
9 minutes ago? I didnt see that. Can you post the pic?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
It was at 8:25 EST, the trap was only 9 pips high but I think it's still legit. I noticed this entry immediately but decided to pass it because of the news. It went up 13 pips but right after the news went south like a crazy.

--- 帖子 #279 ---

This one? Top: 1.36243 Bot: 1.36083

--- 帖子 #282 ---
That would qualify as a mini trap for me. Good for 5 to 10 pips. It doesnt have the depth. Well, that is how I look at it.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Be careful takng the short. It might be just fake.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
forexforex, are you able to answer my questions on page 18 ? which pairs are you trading at the moment ? thanks

hi guys. Im new here and i see this system as very good. Still learning... is this pic right please?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
A runner is when I take half off and leave the other half and let it run all the way with Stop Loss set close to breakeven. For, example: Live right now &gt;&gt;&gt; I went long @ 1.3626 with 2 lots. When it reaches my target at 1.3656 I take 1 lot off with a profit of 30 pips. I let the other lot run all the way north and set the SL to 1.3625, so if it goes south I only lose 1 pip. My runner usually is implemented when When I see clear trend, otherwise, I exit all at the target I only trade EURUSD. I use 1 hour TF to confirm my trades. I like to see a bigger picture. This comes through experience. If I had not look at the 1 Hr TF then I would have taken the short @ 1.3605 and getting stopped out with a loss trade. It just saves me trouble from taking the fakes move. Please see my previous posts. i try to post my 1 hr chart as much as possible, but Raz' system, I think, doesn't consider the larger TFs yet, so I am hesitant in posting 1hr TF here. This is Raz' system and I don't have the right to cloud his methodology or interject my own technique if it has not supported yet but the author or the majority of the members.

i will be trading this method live tomorrow during london open. hope to see you all, so that we can trade together. my first time using this method !

--- 帖子 #288 ---
how would you confirm the trend using 1 hour chart ? how many candles do you look at ? eu is long term bearish at present.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I look at the previous day, sometimes several days, and also the current day. No specific numbers of candles. Then I draw lines where i see the support and resistance or the point where Support/resistance are separated, then If the trap happens above the line I take the long. If it happens below the line I take the short. The probability of my wins have been increased since i have been doing this.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
So sometimes I have only 1 or 2 trades in a day, but good ones.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hello, As I said in chat, in an effort to filter out some bad trades, especially in volatile US session, here are 2 indies that Draw S/R One for monthly - weekly - daily open and the other that needs GTM 0+ or +1 broker time (eg. Interbank - alpari UK) draws daily Fibonacci S/R

--- 帖子 #293 ---
One of my best trading days is today...when everything falls as planned. I finally got a chance to draw my chart to show you guys how I trade this system. i apologize if I delineate from Raz' methodology. I already have two other systems that I am current watching so I wanted a 1 minute trading system that will keep me on my toes but simple. But I find it sometimes complicated because i have to readjust the dotted red lines ( 1 HR support/resistance) and the bold red lines ( 1 min current day analysis). But I keep it simple as possible and redraw the lines according to the past and developing trend. I would like to start a thread so people here could help me draw also or if there is a programming indicator that can do the drawing, but I really don't have time right now to manage a thread. And besides, I want RAZ' system to develop and grow here as he finds his system already profitable. Anyway, I leave you guys alone so you can implement Raz' methodology which I find it a little too aggressive for me. Just wanted to show you guys that Raz' system is similar to my system and both profitable used systematically and carefully. The difference is that I look at higher TF and I draw and redraw the support/resistance lines for the current trading day for analysis. This works for me. The other difference is that my TakeProfit is 20-30 pips and I have a runner. Raz: As I said before I am not comfortable yet using the spreadsheet. i will gain confidence may be after demoing it. Thanks again for starting this thread. i hope that many will find it profitable. forexforex

Thanks Cosmoras. This will definitely help me alot.

Hello all, good work last night, and way to keep trading it. I am off to work soon. As of last night it didn't seem like I posted much in the thread, because of the skype room. I am not by any means abandoning the thread. However to post valid traps and entries is faster with skype. I will post my live trades and traps at night, and hopefully try to explain as well when I am trading something or not. I appreciate all those who follow and keep up with this, and like Favorite and Forexforex keep it going. Pmg.g Sorry for not answering your question, but I will try to get back to it as soon as I can. So be on tonight, will post traps and entries tonight here on FF, but the skpye room(it's back to just one by the way) 'Price Trap Open Discussion' has been a very big hit with this method. Lot's of traders got in with me on the first trade and made the winner, even though it got 1 pip from stopping out. I am starting to get a flood of questions, which I don't want to leave anyone hanging so feel free to ask again. As many of you are starting to realize this method is not hard to learn or trade, but it takes some guts to make entries. So again thanks for all the help Favorite and Forexforex on others I will be on later tonight.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi guys! How to connect to that Skype Room? How do I find it on Skype?... Regards!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hey Raz thanks for sharing the strategy with rest of us.I have a question considering what to do when we are stopped by sl. Should I execute sell (becose it waits on the other side of the tunnel) order or this price trap is busted and I have to wait for another to form in order to start new trade Thanks

--- 帖子 #298 ---
if I am not active, look for these users to add you in for skype active users: phneutral timjmaxwell jagz frederick mercier peter pottage peter porter there are way more, but they are usually active through out. Be back on later today

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I wash my hands of that trade, and look for a new trap to form.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Thank you, forexforex! And I also appreciate you sharing you H-1 confirmation method.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
raz, sharing this system and opening the thread is very nice and generous of you. Maintaining a popular thread is not only a big responsibility, but it is also time-consuming. I know what I'm talking about, in May/June I used to maintain a "Trading Made Simple" thread on another forum. I swear to God, maintaining the thread, answering the questions and PMs took me 2-3 hours per day, sometimes even more. So I really appreciate what you're doing and I think we all have to do our best helping.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi Raz....earlier on you posted a chart with a green box on it where you highlighted a candle that was an invalid rejection candle...can you explain ? T

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I was referring to the fact that it doesn't count with the trap I was setting. Although it was a legit price rejection, it was consistent to the trap that was forming. Sorry it was not clear in the illustration, but I look for the trap to have consistent touches.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Something important to notice. I haven't watched too price action during the US session, because primarily I have a work and daily life. However I will make this point of view. I believe price does behave differently during other sessions, not necessary tied in with lack of volume, but just in price action alone. You take the fact that I have price action on just the EUR/USD for close to about 6 months. Sometimes I will watch price on my time off during the US session, after UK has closed and realize it does show different swings and price rejections. So it's hard for me to say that this method will work all day, but if it does then by all means have at it. I am curious to see if someone is having good success with other pairs on this, but this for I am steady on the EUR/USD. Low spread, and great volatility. Raz

--- 帖子 #305 ---
how about this one? although is not trading time.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I won't be able to trade this London Open - family matters, a relative is visiting. Oh well, there will be other days and other sessions. Good luck and happy pipping, everybody!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
good job. the problem is the entry point is a little bit higher for this one!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Let's be patient and wait for valid setups. Alot of us are getting eager to trade so bad they are trying to force a possibility when they are not certain if they have valid traps or setups regardless. So practice makes perfect, and if you are not certain then please do not trade any serious money until you are.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
upper level is 1.3618 lower level is 1.3599 looking for entry

--- 帖子 #310 ---
is this a valid trap now Raz?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
longed behind entry line, but that is bonus pips now, so let's see where she goes

--- 帖子 #312 ---
plenty of chance to get in if you want to demo it, but I am in at 1.3617, tjhat is one pip behind the entry line

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Well done Raz.....another hit...now you can sleep in peace..lol

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Out at 3656 Raz keep us updated here, can't connect to skype dunno why... Tks!

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Yes TP did hit. I had to run a stupid update on my cpu right at that time so had to leave the skype room. But Got the TP anyways, gj all!

--- 帖子 #316 ---
hi, raz, the following trap is not a valid trap, why?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
well for one it is 29 pips wide, and what time are you looking at this at?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi raz, Not trying to change the focus of your thread, but have you looked at the 5M tf? Tks for you view &amp; sharing your method. ___________________________

--- 帖子 #319 ---
yes, but again I prefer 1 min. ty raz

--- 帖子 #320 ---
upper level 1.3666 lower level 1.3651 shorted already... If you demo now is time to get in.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Please Michael, I have a question (also asked withskype): I do not understand that invalidated the first trap this morning (see picture). thank you!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
i missed this one. forget to set alarm. just got up from bed now, nearly 2 hrs after london open ! oh well.. did you take the first minute of the 11 minute count from when price hit level 1.3599 ?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
yes about 11 of us trading live got in and go teh first one, and now we are in the second one . So hopefully 2 winners tonight, off to bed for now

--- 帖子 #324 ---
well i cant see a setup right now

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Can somebody show a chart of the last trap formation please...I had 1.3663 as the top of the range...and it would have hit sl...1.3666 and It would be safe... T

--- 帖子 #326 ---
?? please post your chart with the level...

--- 帖子 #327 ---
up 80 pips today ! i use a modified version of this strategy ! thanks again for the time you spend on skype ! Fred

--- 帖子 #328 ---
well done mate

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Dear Raz and friends, Is this a valid setup? cheers ^o^

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Well done Fred...great pipping....care to enlighten us on the slight modifications bro? T

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Second trade from last night clipped my SL by one pip, and went down and looked like it hit TP. However that is how it goes sometimes. So again another night where I made 4% gain, and lost 2%. Actually with bonus pips and getting in behind trade I made 3.3% gain last night. So not a bad night, actually +% gain any night is a bonus. Good job last night all. I appreciate all that are helping me answer questions.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Raz, first of all, let me thank you for being so generous to share your trading method with all of us. I just came across your thread and I had a quick look at EU to see any possible setup (it's 5.20pm here in the UK). I believe I found one good setup according to your rules, but I would like you to take a few minutes to have a look at the picture attached and see wheter or not I did the right thing. Once again, thanks for sharing and for taking the time to read this. Regards, akrasiel

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I have been asked various forms of this question, "what's your drawdown... how many losing trades have you had? Bla bla bla? Although this is a valid question I just don't understand asking it. You may bounce from method to method, or system to system asking what the results maybe. But does that really help you be successful? Lot of you that think if by asking this question, this will help you progress in Forex.... you are absolutely off track. I don't mind sharing my success, but wait think about this for sec... THIS IS ME! NOT YOU! In order to ever be successful in anything you need to practice and experiment. Learn from your mistakes, and make adjustments that best fits you. I am getting so many people asking what my results are, and then never hearing from them for again. I mean what do you expect? Because I can have good results that it should be good for you, NO! If I told you that I made +45% gain per week, and you did the same method and gained +10% a week. Would that be because I was a liar, or maybe it could be that you are not trusting your own abilities to test things out. I feel like a lot of new traders, and let me say this 'I was like this at the start of my forex career' 'Trying to make money now, and make it fast' Too many of you are not experimenting before realizing what you have in hand. Your own results will dictate whether you can accomplish something or not, just like trading a method. It may or may not be for you. Most of the traders who have traded with me alongside at night will vouch and may know me by now that I am not 'cocky' or have an ego. However if you are diving into this method and not quite sure about what you can gain from it, then take this thread and my sharing as a chance to experiment and learn. I mean I post my trades live as I take them, and I show exactly where and when and why I get in. However I am getting message left and right via the room or privately saying things like.. "I saw you longed at 1.3615, so did I what is the Stop loss and Take Profit?" I'm like what! Are you kidding me? If you cant figure out what Stop Loss and Take Profit on such a short thread by now, why are you even trading it or even trading real money? This is the reason why forex traders have lost so much. I am not a trade signal service, and never would ask anything in return for posting my trades live. However if you are going to try and trade this with me and learn this method, then do my the damn favor and read the thread! I would say abut 80% people on skype among the 30+ members active online, are starting to get it with me. But don't take a live trade with me if you see that I posted that I longed or shorted, and have no idea why or when or what reason I took the trade. I may sound like I am upset, but I am trying to help others, and that is why I shared this method. I believe in helping and making this educational, but if you can't take the time to help yourself... the you are not going to be successful in trading. Raz

--- 帖子 #334 ---
This is how I see it

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi RAZ! With reference to my previous mail, I know I am new in this forum, but I’ve been doing forex trading for at least a year., But my losing trades are more than the winning, that’s why I go everywhere, every plate form where I find some hope. I was about to quit trading then I came across your thread, you are the hope, the light. Now a days I am doing trade on Demo, could you plz let me know what is the best time to trade with your 1MF. I work Monday to Friday, 8 to 4 Eastern time. Waiting for your reply, Take care, Sevenskies

--- 帖子 #336 ---
TP was hit a few minutes ago (2xSL + 3 pips, as rules say). Not bad at all!! Thanks Raz

--- 帖子 #337 ---
i use a longer timeframe to set a trap (resistance and support) and trade within that trap, 5 pips at the time (profit wise) putting sl at top or bottom of that bigger trap. kinda hard to explain, if you want to get added on the skype group ill explain further anyway this thread is about raz method not mine stick with his method, it works... plain and simple, then once you got the hang of it, try to implement your own style Fred

--- 帖子 #338 ---
GJ, way to give it a shot!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
whats your modified version finalwar ? you can pm me if you wish, as not to spoil raz's thread..

--- 帖子 #340 ---
valid trap up level 1.3553 lo level 1.3537

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Nice.Thanks RAZ.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
go south,lol

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I missed it, it took off to fast. It never retraced back to let us in to make it happen. So have to void and look for another trap

--- 帖子 #344 ---
up 1.3519 lo 1.3506

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Thanks. I tried Fibo in MT4, and get the same target as Raz method. So quick. Thanks for your sharing. Thanks so much.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
missed it again, looking for another trap

--- 帖子 #347 ---
trap...1.3503 top...1.3487 bottom

--- 帖子 #348 ---
hello raz just got up now to trade the london open. but it seems iam late again. what is the best time to start looking at charts to trade london open ? an hour before london open ? are you in on the second trade ? i think i can still enter now if price retraces back up...

--- 帖子 #349 ---
new trap? much narrow?1.3503 1.3494

--- 帖子 #350 ---
This ones a buy....decisions decisions..lol

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I entered at 1.35329, TP 30 got hit pretty fast (in 20 minutes). I scalped 60+ pips during evening, I think I'd better stop right now, because of the "Unempoyment claims". Maybe I'm too cautious, but I usually don't trade NFP and "Unempoyment claims".

--- 帖子 #352 ---
instead of entering this trade , would it not be better to enter the last trade of h -1.3519 , l- 1.3506... at a better price ? because that last still hasnt gone into profit. what do you think raz ?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi, Are you all in a skype room now? I am in a completely different trade I didnt see the buy I just saw a sell currently in DD but thats fine im trying out a new system, have to "try before u buy" Any1 in the room now?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Surely not because your high SL point has been "breached"

--- 帖子 #355 ---
First sell a hit...second sell stopped out.....third buy still running..

--- 帖子 #356 ---
No because the high (SL point) has been breached so it is no longer a retracement for that particular setup.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
fortunately for the prev trap theres a bullish cross on 15 min chart, suggesting more UP price movement.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
So do you hedge trades? Or do you close the prev. trap if a new trap appears?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
i was looking at it, when sl had not been reached. now its obviously too late.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
was there another buy trap at 3526???..( the third buy trap hit tp)

--- 帖子 #361 ---
no

--- 帖子 #362 ---
no the buy trap did not hit tp unless you got in slightly slowly and did not use the better price as extra bonus pips. Tp was @ 1.35386 which was just missed. Still may get there we shall see.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
cant see it getting there tbh. best to close it out a profit.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Possible sell trap @ 1.3526 high @ 1.3538. However I am not entirely sure the experience i have is from the pictures ive seen on this thread.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
do u see it as a possible sell trap whatfx? or is it not clear enough?

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi autotrader....if you look between 1.3514 and 1.3526..was that not a valid buy trap??..12th candle broke up....just curious

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Yes I am sorry, I probably will have to leave this thread for questions and information about 'how' to trade this method. Posting live here and live in the room are getting to be a bit of a hassle. But being live in the chat room has been very effective. That is where all the live action is happening. To sum up the night, we had two back to back traps where we missed the chance to get in. Although the second trade would have been a loss, we missed it. The third trap was valid, and we all got in right around 1.3503 for a long position, and it barely clipped TP at 1.3536. So everyone made money on that one. Big group in the room. Lots of members in the skype room are starting to pick it up, and have been helpful answering questions for me. Since the room has grown to about 91 invited members and growing. Lots of activity being tossed around. So I will be now just posting my live trades in there as we come across them. But member's like Owen Henry in the room is getting it spot on every trap. So it helps to have someone other then me explain what we are doing. But overall it was very pleasing to hear so many people have been +pips for the week using this method.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
none

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi autotrader...the trap your refering to only had 9 candles...11 minimum according to Raz

--- 帖子 #370 ---
hi raz in your experience what is the best time to start looking at charts for the london open for valid traps, an hour before london open ?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Cheers raz. Yes I saw the 03 however i got in @ 04 because thats just the number i got so my tp was 1 pip above, is ok i closed for some profits anyway. Yes id like to be in the room however I dont know how to get in. Ive added people from it but no reply. I understand theres 1 more hour left for a valid trap? 07:00 GMT - 10:00GMT am i correct? Thanks again

--- 帖子 #372 ---
for a perfect trap formation, the formation has to be 'v' shaped. there should be ''two'' price rejection on one side and '' one'' price rejection on the other side. neither has occured in the above example you gave.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Both the one I am talking about and the one you are talking about are invalid trades. As whatfx just really well actually i get what he is saying I appreciate it waht fx, thumbs up for u!... "for a perfect trap formation, the formation has to be 'v' shaped. there should be ''two'' price rejection on one side and ''one'' price rejection on the other side. neither has occured in the above example you gave."

--- 帖子 #374 ---
raz, I can feel you pain, but that is the nature of these forums. You are going to have these &amp; many more questions as the days go by. Yes, many of these questions have already been covered, but you as the author of this thread are going to keep getting pounded by those that refuse to take the time to read &amp; research for themselves. Its seems you are about to solve some of the problems by the content of post #367. That is about all you can do. Oh, by the way the 5M question that I had I already knew the answer because of MY research, but just was inquiring as to your possible experience with that time frame. Best of luck to you with your thread &amp; the traders that join you. __________________________

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Raz. Thanks for the tremendous effort you are putting into this thread. It has been one of the best threads I have explored, if not the best with regards to low time-frame trading set-ups. Having said that, I would like to show something which has made a huge contribution to my decision as to when to enter a trade. It seems to take some of the pressure off, because of the fast moving 1 minute TF. If you feel that this post has no place here, just say the word and I shall remove it immediately(no offence to me).

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Yes this is true as it goes with creating a thread acetrader like you and me we both have asked questions. I would like to join the skyperoom and get on with rading. ill keep looking for setups to sharpen up.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
leave me alone here?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Nobody is being left out... Open discussion in Skype Room is so intense and "super interesting "... I missed it today, due to some field work. But that's where the Price Trap riders are... . Bear in mind, it's a TF 1M trading, Q&amp;A in between keeping an eye on new set up... Cheers

--- 帖子 #379 ---
raz, I agree with everything that acetrader said. I already mentioned that I opened a "Trading Made Simple" thread on another forum and maintained it in May/June. I left the thread and said "Good-bye" after one and a half months. I felt that I already explained everything, did my best, gave everything I've got and if answering questions in the thread and in PMs was OK at first, answering the same questions for the hundred times became a little too much for me. You've made the right decision focusing on the chat room. I don't want to boast, but I get every trap you set up, I feel I mastered the method. This system is very stable, very profitable and very reliable. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I'll second that! It's been an absolute pleasure to trade with you guys for the last few days. Thank you so much for all the time you have put into teaching us whilst still making your trades. Can't thank you enough. Superb stuff.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
How do you get into the skype room ?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Can someone add me to the skype discussion room? My skype name is njshak3zula. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Favorite, Raz has truely shared a nice clean way to trade &amp; I am mixing it in with what I am currently doing. The only difference is I am appling it to the 5m tf &amp; it is working well. I too have considered starting a thread to share how I trade, but I just do not have the time or the patience to do it. After seeing how short term this &amp; other threads are running I am certain no thread will be started by me. In reference to your thread, I have an interest if you would PM me with its location I would be greatful. Thanks &amp; good trades. ______________________

--- 帖子 #384 ---
To those that are following on the thread I thought I would share this small bit of info that I'm sure some have already discovered, but maybe others can benefit from it anyway. When you find these as call them price consolidation zones take notice if the consolidations are near key support &amp; resistance levels......for instant if the consolidation is above the pivot level &amp; that pivot level had been rejecting attempts at crossing under the pivot....heads up. This is just an example of using S&amp;R Levels &amp; the consolidations. Raz.....not trying to interfere with what you are sharing, but just sharing what I see as another tool to go along with your info. There is NO DOUBT what you have shared will work once some chart time is spent watching these consolidations develope. Thanks for sharing &amp; best wishes for your trading in the future. ____________________

Hi there Are people trading in the skype room today? I have submitted, please add me. Thanks PC

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I see 3317 to 3331, but price does not pullback yet!

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I got in at the 8.39 candle, ( I took that as a pullback)maybe premature, hard to say! Lets see what happens PC

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Now, I'm in

--- 帖子 #391 ---
so, i missed the entry an hour ago. seems price hasnt reached tp yet. so i think its safe to enter if price pulls back towards entry line ? what you say folks ...?

--- 帖子 #392 ---
did you guys get stopped out around 45 minutes after entry ?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
grabbed the pips. +31 It was at 1 pip from SL ! Amazing how this thing works!

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Me too Check PM PC

--- 帖子 #396 ---
i got in a bit late around 13342 . decided to take the trade as eu had opened with a gap down, so was expecting a pullback to the upside. felt it was safe to enter even though few pips gone. as price was likely to go up. got out at + 20 ..

--- 帖子 #397 ---
dAMN SKYPE!!

--- 帖子 #398 ---
So sorry guys last night. For some reason I had no internet all last night. Cox just came out and got it fixed. So I hope all went well

--- 帖子 #399 ---
are these two valid traps? the first one turned out to be a loss? although both of them are not in the trading period...

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi Guys... This is my trap that I set prior NY open... Cheers Sahars

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Mine was this one +27

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Very good job and keeping this rolling. As for last night I was trying to figure out why I couldn't get internet connection. It wasn't on me. someone down the street in my neighborhood had moved out. In the process of disconnecting them, THEY DISCONNECT ME! Oh well life goes on. It was about two hours in when I decided to give up trying and goto sleep. It was one lost night of trading. However I will be back on tonight. I do apologize for leaving so many people uninvited to Skype. As the skype has been the most effective way to trade this live and learn. My heart still belongs to this forum. So should be on track tonight. I am not at my home cpu right now, but I will be on for sure when next trading session(remember this is my time that I trade) is running. Michael "Raz" Sargent

--- 帖子 #410 ---
i see a trap at 13224 upper 13204 lower

--- 帖子 #411 ---
upper 13224 triggered. anyone in ?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
upper 1.3223 lower 1.3204

--- 帖子 #413 ---
havent entered yet. price has retraced. may it is a good time to enter now..

--- 帖子 #414 ---
It must break first and then u enter on pullback. Patience is the trick U must have a clear close above or below the range to call it a break.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
but it has broken upper level

--- 帖子 #416 ---
well iam in at upper level, with half the position. if it retraces down, i will enter again with other half...

--- 帖子 #417 ---
stopped out on long. - 21 pips.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
me too, first trade was a loss for me

--- 帖子 #419 ---
how do i get on skype

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Raz Thanks for a good thread, I'm in at 3199, come what may, I like your method and will keep at it for sometime.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
why 3199 ?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
It broke lower level and it was where my market order put me in, when I first looked at the trap I thought it was making a double top when viewed on 15m and there is a daily pivot 20pips above the trap high, so I hesitated when pa broke and closed above. But I am no expert.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
so i gather you are short. i didnt take the short because as i understand the rules, if the first trade fails, then you dont enter in the opposite direction. just wait for the next setup.... i dont see a daily pivot you mention..

--- 帖子 #424 ---
I decided not to enter long because H-1 stochastic was well above 80 and I was expecting the move down. Besides I didn't like the M-1 PA and the movement didn't look good. I entered short at 1.32050, the TP 30 pips got hit in less than 15 minutes. Last week I was testing with 0.01 lot, but this session I traded the system with a full lot. Thank you, raz!

--- 帖子 #425 ---
trap ? upper 3189 lower 3173

--- 帖子 #427 ---
I think a trap is a trap. When I saw that the long breakout was a fake, I fixed the trap a little bit, made an upper level 1.32263 instead of 1.32245, and that's it.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Possible Trap :- High 1.3189 and Low 1.3173. Has just broken out as I am typing, wait for a retrace!

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I think a new trap is forming. Good luck, everybody, and have a nice session!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Daily pivot as supplied by IBfx, i got out at 3177 for 22 pips, too nervous to wait longer, but I am sure it will hit target. Done for this morning, will come back later to try it in the EU/US overlap. Sorry I was not aware of the rule, only read this thread last night.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
... to see how the scalpers are doing? how are you finding the EURO? seems pretty easy to me, it is one of my FAVORITE pair to trade patience pays for me

--- 帖子 #432 ---
how did you know it was a fake ? why did you wait and not enter. you cant tell if it is a fake, until you are stopped out.. and why did you enter on the short side ? only 1 trade per setup as per rules.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
yes gj, and I got in at 1.3171, so a little slip.... but holding short

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Callisto If real money its impressive, if demo it doesn't mean s%$t.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
m in on it too. well, iam in on it too. if this one gets stopped out, then i aint touching eu for the day.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
As I said before, I decided not to enter mostly because my 8,3,3 stochastic on H-1 was almost 90. I made decision not to enter long before the upper level was broken. raz goes where the currency goes, but unlike him I don't have several months' of trading this system, so I decided to check with H-1. I'm not the only one, forexforex checks with the H-1 too, I got this idea from him (thank you, forexforex!). So basically I decided to take only short entries before I started trading. I disagree that you can't know know that it is a fake before SL. Since I saw that it went only 2-3 pips above the upper level and reversed, I knew it was a fake. The upper level is not made of stone... I would agree about, let's say, 5-7 pips, but 2-3 pips?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Raz, hope you don't mind me posting this. For those who are prepared to be patient, have a look and learn.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I was a little slow, entered short at 1.31647, decided to exit with a small profit at 1.31543. Well, +10 pips is better than a possible loss IMHO.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
good to know. but i disagree that only 2-3 pips break and reverse should be assumed to be fake. many times it can go back up.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Callisto, how was your vacation? Sorry for the off-top, but are you a girl or a guy?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
It can, but it more often doesn't that it does. But, of course, it is just IMHO.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
[quote=Favorite;5010106]It can, but it more often doesn't that it does. But, of course, it is just IMHO. [/quox. / te] whats your settings on the 833 stoch ? smooth, median price, fixed max./min. ? its not always the case that above/below 90 means the market is heading the opposite. check 29/9/11. above 90, but price still goes up...

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Leokira, ah, do I detect a hint of jealousy? the only meaning the chart could have for you is whatever you decide to give it, however, apart from the impressive dollars, it just could mean I have an awesome system. Favorite, great holiday, I missed you so much, and as for sex, remember the internet is much like the market, you never know what you will get

--- 帖子 #444 ---
pete123, it is very impressive! However: I don't want to be annoying, but it is just one trade. Is it the only trade you analyzed with fibo? If it is not, how many trades have you analyzed?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
stopped out on 2nd trap trade. - 16 pips. iam done on eu for the day..

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Callisto, that's why I asked you! I can't say to a guy that I missed him, you must be a girl to hear it from me!

--- 帖子 #447 ---
It is Stochastic Slope from the "Trading Made Simple" with the default settings, downloaded here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...49#post4569749 Yes, of course sometimes stochastic stays above 90 for many hours, but I also analyze M-1 itself.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
that well, i cant download that. my default settings on mt4 are , smooth, price high/low = median, fix max/min = 0. could be different to that.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Simple, Close/Close, 0.0 to 1.0 It is strange that you couldn't download it, just in case I attached it.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
i think fix min is 0 and max 100, not 1. if 1 then out of range !

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Yes, probably I gave the wrong setting, but it is the only one I could find. (It is a very special stochastic, it is not a "normal" stochastic.) The settings say: "Slope threshhold=0.0 to 1.0"

--- 帖子 #452 ---
l first before posting.. i have thought of a couple of improvements which could better the viability of this method. but i need raz's approval first before posting...

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Gonna post my trades as they were today, with some comments: Trade 1: Looser

trade 2: Looser

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Trade 3: Looser (out of RAZ trading hours)

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Trade 4: Winner

nice work there. It's just a numbers game thats all. See I think with good r:r you can still always be ahead. Last night was two losers, but hey a new night is ahead for me.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hi raz, I know you've mentioned this elsewhere on skype but I have forgotten, what is your strike rate percentage? R/R is healthy and I won't change that. Cheers Pete

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I win about 65% of the time. Last week I was almost 50 50 win loss, but still finished +11% for the week in acct bal gain. Little lower then average, but I will take it

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Excellent, thanks for your speedy reply raz Pete

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I'm a huge fan of price action strategies. Just read through the first 16 pages before skipping to this page Excited to give this strategy a try and add to my arsenal, definitely looks like a legitimate and logical one. Though are you folks mainly on skype now or is there still some trade updates here? Thanks Raz for starting this enlightening thread!

--- 帖子 #463 ---
most of live trading is discussed on skype, however I try to post it here. But I still use this thread to help answer any questions for educational purposes.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Thanks Raz for sharing! I have read the entire thread and am very eager to start trading it. Hope to see you on Skype! Regards, Nico

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Maybe it was not a "classical" trap (1.33167/1.32954), but I entered at 1.33181. So far I'm 10 pips up.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
no trap according to the rules, so not sure why you entered...

--- 帖子 #467 ---
The price started ranging, exited with +13 pips. Better than nothing!

--- 帖子 #468 ---
so you are actually not trading this system favorite !

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Maybe it doesn't look so great right now, but at the moment it looked OK. The price had been rejected once on the top and twice at the bottom with a "V" form. I should "tighten" the trap, making the upper level 1.33103, but the price moved too quickly, so i didn't have the time to do it. As to my exit - I said before and I'm saying again: I'm not going to follow bluntly the rule that the price must hit either TP or SL. I trade with real money, and if I see that the price going against me, I'd better exit with a small profit (and maybe enter again later) than lose money just in order to say proudly that I follow the rules.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
no 'v' formation at bottom , difference (gap) in price at bottom. so not perfect 'v'. hence i didnt take trade..

--- 帖子 #471 ---
and because its not a perfect 'v', as you can see the trade did not work out... perfect v would have had a good degree of success.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Perfect "V" doesn't come in very often. And by "gap" in price at bottom you mean a difference in 1.1 pip? Come on, it is not geometry, it is live trading!

--- 帖子 #473 ---
You must be kidding... Maybe in theory, but not in real life. But that's OK, it is IMHO. You wait for a perfect "V", I prefer just to make money.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Well, it was fun, I have to return to my trading. Good-bye, everybody!

--- 帖子 #475 ---
well you are entitled to trade your way.....

--- 帖子 #476 ---
well cant see any traps so far today. iam off to trade gu... made a measley 20 pips shorting from 13311 to 13290. not a trap trade, but ..... until tomorrow london time folks...!

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Some up front clarification for Raz and thread followers: 1) I am in Iraq, no longer have internet in a place where I can download data, and it will be another month before I'm home to do backtesting on this. I mention this because I would happily satisfy my own curiosity on my own (via backtesting), without having to ask a question below. 2) In no way can I argue with Raz's ~14% return, but I want to know if it can be better. 3) I have read the thread. Ok, I know I'll need screen time. I understand the entry rules. I *really* appreciate the charts you guys (and gals) are adding. So, no questions there, perhaps until I actually get back home. However, I would like to know about money/trade management. Raz, I see your rules. And I see your results. GREAT stuff. No questions there... but I have a few questions. With approximately 6 months of trading this system behind you and roughly 2 trades per day (obviously estimating), you have a lot of data to look back on. My math shows you may have about 250 trades on this, using those assumptions. Have you analyzed some various money management ideas, like... * perhaps moving SL to BE (+/-) once price reaches 1x, 1.5x, etc. (where x is height of the trap) and/or... * taking 1/2 off at 1x, 1.5x, or 2x, and letting the rest "run" to the next box (allowing it to continue if the box breaks in the proper direction) and/or... any other infinite possibilities. You've obviously traded a long time (from your explanation in post 1), seem pretty intelligent about all this, and you're kicking butt. So, I'm curious if you would be willing to elaborate on any analysis or simple observations you may have to offer regarding trade management. Second question. Are you adding spread to your stop loss or take profit on the buy side? If the top of your trap is at 1.3545 and there is a 2 pip spread, are you waiting for it to come back to 1.3543 in order to go long at 1.3545... or are you primarily just getting in the first time it comes back to 1.3545, even though you've technically lost the spread? Again... I only ask for your version. Believe me, I won't even touch this without back testing, but I'm curious what your personal philosphy is on this one. Thanks for your time, strategy, and great thread. It is sincerely appreciated.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi PH, Couldn't join you guys last night.. Thanks for the charts! Just a quick observation... looks like all trades except for trap5 gave at least a 1:1 profit/loss ratio before turning around to hit sl.. That will test the mental toughness of a trader! Cheers

--- 帖子 #489 ---
is anyone trading the asian...?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Well it has been a rough week for me and anyone trying it out this week. But going to keep taking valid traps. If you look back at 1 hour candles price action hasn't done much. However I appreciate all of you giving it a try. So hopefully we can break forward and make some money. GJ to posting here.

Nice looking trades today for this system... Phneutral...what was it about trap 5 in your previous charts that you spotted...that it travelled at least R:R 1...before retracing??...just curious T

--- 帖子 #510 ---
A breakout strategy, entering -3 pips from the low or +3 from the high of the trap offers you 1:1 R:R. (except on trap 5) So, Yes that's it, 7 wins, 1 looser. Lets continue to watch the trades. PH

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Trade 3: trap inside trap inside trap... still developing.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
trade 3 update, Winner

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I took trade 2 and trade 3. I missed trade 1 because was busy watching another system and trying to follow 5 currencies... What can I say? It was a last straw, I decided to trade only Price-Trap system (I used the system several times during Asian and American sessions, I'm sure I can use it successfully at any time of the day). I also think I'd better focus on just one currency - Euro. So I have a question: have anybody tried to trade only one currency? I don't mean this particular system, I mean the whole trading plan. I feel that trading only Euro will be good for me. Is trading several currencies really much better than trading only Euro? Does Euro give enough opportunities, enough trades? I always traded at least 3 currencies, I traded crosses and British pound more often than Euro, and now I'm kind of anxious. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Didn't try other currencies yet. I will focus on this one till have a few hundreds of trades to look. And then draw conclusions. Yesterday 8 trades, today 3 until now. I think its enough opportunities. Best to your trading. PH

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Raz - Thank you for sharing the system. Phneutral - Thank you for your time in high-lighting and posting charts; For those that can't make it to the skype discussion - it makes learning a lot easier. Cheers and Good Trading.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hey, all, I wrote a bit of a long post here with questions , and I realized maybe I could ask a favor, instead... Would someone be willing to go to their MT4 History Center and Export their 1 minute data for EURUSD (as well as any other pair you feel is worth back testing)? If you're willing, I'm assuming you'll have to email me the data because of file size, so shoot me a PM and I'll send you an email address. Like my post says, I'm in Iraq and don't have access to a network to get the data anymore, and it will be a month before I'm back "home". So ANY help would be appreciated so I can backtest and check this out! Thanks

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Traps 4 and 5: Both winners if u could manage an entry. Didn't take it Just focus on the colors.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I will send you the data, leave your email. PH

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Not a trap although i took it... ends BE

--- 帖子 #523 ---
ok maybe I can shed some light. I have had tried different combos of r:r. I even tested 1:5 r:r. However after many trials and errors I come to realize what I feel works best for 'me' is 1:2 with bonus pips. Now like I have posted before, and forgive me for not getting back to you thus sooner. What works for me is my comfort level, and it may not be your comfort level. We are trading purely off of price action, so there is no limit or undercut to where you can take your trades. There is no filter, or any indicator to filter trades out. You can enter however you feel, or however you want to close it. The reason I say this is because I don't want people to take the perception that this method only works the way I trade it. Now I have a few guys in my skype room that trade with me have mentioned 1:1 ratio, because of the poor start this week we had. However it's all discretion at this point. I was asked last night would I adjust my r:r because of this week. My answer was 'no'. I am not perfect, nor think that I am pro trader. But I feel to be consistent in trading is that you have to have a plan that you are comfortable with and have tested out, and willing to lose money through the hard times. I am not a out to prove to anyone that I can I make money trading. But as for r:r being tested multiple ways, to answer your question yes I have, but I just feel this works best for me. Anything that anyone thinks is a better way to trade this or feels comfortable with then by all means test it out and try it. However my back test results and live results are a 'moot' point. Because in reality it will take true experimenting for anyone to understand what they can gain from this. I shared this method intially not to say to others that you have to trade exactly by the rules.... come on guys this is Price Action, anything is possible. I would expect you to take what I have shared and gain a different perspective on trading Price Action, and mold it into whatever makes it comfortable for you. I am not here to say what you are doing is right or wrong, but I will give my honest opinions. I like what members like Favorite and Phneutral are doing. They are trying all sorts of combos to make it work for them. I do have a few people who are trading it side by side with me, and are going through the ups and downs with it. To answer your last questions about spread. Again backtest/forward test with your own feeling. I trade with MBtrading and the spread is usually .7-1.0 pips So no I dont adjust for spread. Hopefully you can stop looking at candle bars with indicators that are telling you at the moment, vs minimize your candles and see price action over a perioud of 2 to 3 hours. Start to see how price acts, and this is what this method is all about. View price actively and you will slowly start to see a certain rhytum formed.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi Raz and other thread contributors, I have been practicing how you use the trapping techniques for few weeks and for a little more than a week now that i have been trading successfully with you system. I just added some variations of my trading techniques that I have been profitable in the past. Well, to some it up, your system shed a new light to my trading. Thanks again for introducing us and sharing us your system. forexwinall

And now the question! What have all those traps in common, except for trap 7 ? See u guys tomorrow PH

--- 帖子 #532 ---
I am glad to come across this system , have read most of this thread and decided to have closer look on this , I was able to identify two traps today, both confirmed as correct in trading room (skype), I have traded them both live with different targets though (only 5 pips each trade) , one long , the other one short. Have been trading this pair for some time. I hope to hone my skills thanks to Price Trap. good luck to all thanks raz

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Guys, the system is almost perfect the way it is, but we all know that there were some losses and there will be some losses (which is natural). Right now I trade with a full lot, but I want to test one of my ideas with 0.01 lot for a while. The idea is using lock instead of stop-loss, so it is not about changing the system rules, it is about the MM. I explained using locks instead of stop losses in this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...50#post4815650 I can say that in the last month I used this method five or six times with another system, and one time I ended up losing more than I'd lose with the stop loss, but all other times were successful. In the post I referred to I said: "Of course, the most important (and the most difficult) part is to find the right moment for "unlocking" the lock." and said that we have to wait until the price "topped" or "bottomed". However with Price-Trap system we can just wait for a signal in the opposite direction and then "unlock" the lock.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Ok I have recreated a new room, which I hope will allow me to join right in. I had to reinstall skype all together. Price Trap Open Conversation is now going to be "Price Trap Active Group" I had to do this so I can hopefully get back online with you all.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Truly an excellent, thorough response, Raz. You are doing a great job here, and I hope to "meet" you in the Skype room in a few short months. Very good point on the .7-1 pip spread. I had not thought of that, and again, because I don't have live data, I failed to connect that the spread is basically always low on this pair. So thanks for the reminder. I also appreciate what you said about each system becoming our own. I am acutely aware that the reality is that no 2 traders will end up trading this the same way, and I say that is SMART... as long as each trader has their own, proven reason for doing so. So, I'm with you 100% on that. Nonetheless, I was curious for your feedback on what you have already tried and tested, and I appreciate it. Finally, I left only part of your quote above... it is long-term gold!

Trap 1: Voided.

are you all long on 13436 ?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Trap 2: Don't gave us the entry.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
sl is pretty tight on this one, only 10 pips...

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Approximately at this time I set up a trap for GBPUSD. It was not an ideal trap, but it was more than 9 pips high and I liked the PA, so I took the trade. It already hit my 30 pips take profit. I felt very uncomfortable trading only EURUSD, so I decided to trade only this system but two currencies, EURUSD and GBPUSD, and now I see that it is exactly what I need.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Glad to hear it. Keep posting the results on GBP PH

--- 帖子 #543 ---
we are on our way to hitting tp

--- 帖子 #544 ---
tp hit, + 20 pips anyone else get it ...

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Trap 3: Again, no entry

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Just like last Friday, we missed the first two, although the second Trade was a loser, we missed both entries. We did catch the third and it was a profit. But tough night

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Sure! Here's another one: GBPUSD long 1.55052 at 3:16 EST. In 3 minutes hit TP +30 pips. Once again, not an ideal trap, but good PA supported my decision to take a trade. Sorry, I can't post a picture, don't know what is wrong. Guys, I don't know if any of you want to trade both GBPUSD and EURUSD, but for the ones who want I have a trick: look at EURGBP, if it is long - that means that you'd better trade EURUSD, if it is short - then GBPUSD more active, pay more attention to GBPUSD. It is not a very good Euro session so far, but it is a great session for GBPUSD - in one and a half hours I got 60 pips.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
well that was a trap that developed while i was still in the previous trade. what happens in such a scenario ? i.e. if you are in a trade, but another trap develops. do you close the trade with any loss / profit at the time and go for the new trap ?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
eur.gbp long or short by how many pips ? before london open its pretty much stale..

--- 帖子 #550 ---
whatfx, I trade both currencies (GBPUSD and EURUSD) M-1 , but I analyze EURGBP using H-1 , see whether the current H-1 EURGBP trend is long or short.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
From what i see , normally the second goes in the direction of the first. If not... hummm ... i don't wanna see a bear trap while i'm long on another...

GBPUSD trap is forming right now. Good-bye, everybody!

I took long GBPUSD at 1.55440. Maybe I shouldn't, maybe the long trend already is almost over, and under normal conditions I probably wouldn't take the trade, but as I said before, I want to test my idea about using a lock instead of a stop-loss, so a bad trade would be good for me!

--- 帖子 #555 ---
It went down 20 pips, but I set my "lock" according to the rules in 23 pips (the trap was 23 pips high), so it didn't activate my lock, although it was close. And after that it went up and started ranging, so I exited with a small loss -8 pips. I can live with that! So I had two winning trades 30 pips each and a small loss (I wouldn't take this trade if I traded a full lot, it was obvious that the trend is almost over, but it was for testing). Total profit: GBPUSD +52 pips in two and a half hours. Since it is a Non-Farm Friday, it's time to call it a day!

Trap 4: Winner.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
not exactly a bonified trap. this one came about when the previous trap had just gone into profit. so a lot of us would have missed it.

thanks phneutral for your charts posting, for me it's a backtest and confirm after a trading day and help a lot to understand the PA. thanks again for your work and have a wonderful weekend cheers

--- 帖子 #573 ---
For sure on the "thanks" to phneutral! Great charts, and a public "thank you" for sending me some 1 minute data!

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Well good job Phneutral for being involved here and trading with me in Skype. This method will take sometime to get used to. To visually price first, then look at indicators later. Last week was an example of being disciplined. Of course I never will know what the outcome of Monday night's trading considering I could not trade it. However Tuesday and on I started off with 4 straight Losers. First time ever trading this method. Probably a little hard for any first timers to dive into this live and try it and think maybe this doesn't work. However that is not why I trade it, but we finished strong with 3 straight winners. Although I did void a early trap on Friday's session, and yes it would have been a good trade. However it was my judgement call. So what appeared to be my first losing week on this method, turned out to net 5.8% gain. Way lower then average, but I will take it. Bonus pips helped the difference out. Hopefully next week we can have a big push. Good Job, and risk accordingly

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hey Raz! I have a question for you. Tomorrow is a holiday in the usa and japan, so the market will be not really volatile.. Do you want to trade tomorrow? cheers

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I am going to take Monday off, because we have 3 holidays. USA;Japan;Canada. Although I trade the european markets, it would be a good night to take off for me. So I will be on Tuesday's session

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Trap 1: No entry by the rules.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Trap 2: Big winner ( +43 pips )

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Trap 3: Again, no entry.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
this is a valid entry. what new rule are you using ?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
There was no retrace to the bottom line, so we don't get an entry.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Trap 4: Looser, -11 pips

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Trap 5: no entry

--- 帖子 #587 ---
i cant read anywhere this retrace rule...

--- 帖子 #588 ---
There is. You allways wait for the retrace by RAZ method. If not, u are playing breakout ( that I'm testing right now ) Anyway, trade 6: No entry again.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
please tell more about retraces

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Please browse my charts. There are many examples. We only get an entry if after the level is broken, we get a retrace to it. Otherwise if price goes straight down or up, we don't enter the trade. PH

--- 帖子 #591 ---
nope. cant see it anywhere. read the rules as per what raz has stated, no mention of retrace. perhaps you could point out where raz shows this ? or is it something you have come up with yourself ?

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Na,He probably hasnt said it but he does wait for retrace,In skype Room see it all the time

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Raz does not state to wait for a retrace, but it is a good idea, may keep you out of some bad as well as good trades, the way filtering works. Ph is making good pips, so it suits him. Raz said to adapt to your own style.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
the success rate increases dramatically if you do this: if the break of the trap is by 5-6 pips or more, then it is good to go. you may enter and it is more likely to profit. if the break is by say only 1-4 pips, and then price retraces, the trade is highly likely to fail. do not enter. even if the break is by 5-6 pips, it is best to enter with half your original position. if price retraces, then you can enter with other half at a better price. bottom line: wait for a break of 5-6 pips, enter with half position, re-enter with other half if price moves against you , at a better price. you will see your losses will be minimised happy pipping to all....

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Guys, I don't want to argue, but all this "retrace" stuff and "counting 1-5 pips" and "waiting for the perfect V" works 50/50 or even worse than 50/50, because it also filters out some very good trades. raz gave us all the rules in his first post. forexforex trades very successfully checking with H-1 trend and PA, and it is the best way IMHO. At any case, if you trade in the H-1 direction, your chances are much better with any system. As to 'minimising losses" - everybody has his own way, I already told about using loks instead of stop-losses, for example.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
with the ''retrace '' rule stated by ph, you will miss out on a lot of good trades. with the rules i stated in my last post above, it is a way of minimising losses. which can only be a good thing... and it has worked very well for me so far...

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Well, maybe you can share with us some of the work that got u to those conclusions. I am testing myself a breakout strategy too. Each trader should/could adapt those traps to is style. PH

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Trap 7: Winner: +31, Just incredible how stop 3610 holds

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Favorite, I really agree with you on the "checking trend first" for maximizing success. But, I think the 1 hour timeframe is way too far from the 1 minute. I think the 15m do the job quite well. Regards PH

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Good point, but I think it is kind of individual thing, depends on the trader's habits.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
yeah, 1 hour doesnt hold too much of an edge when using raz's method. could look at 15 min. as regards to what i said above, try my rules and see for yourself. you will cut out a lot of losses. you can incorporate my rules along with your retrace rule and see how things go. sure, u need to wait for a retrace, but if the price doesnt break the trap by at least 5-6 pips , then more than likely it is a false break. even a retrace may not work. just trying to helpful and improve the system to be a winner..! after all, that is what threads are about..

--- 帖子 #604 ---
And I thank you for that. From what I see until now 3 pips above or below the trap, will work on a breakout with a 1:1 ratio. Today there were 5 winners and 1 looser with it. Last week worst day was friday with 5 wins and 3 losses. U can check it on my charts. I will have now your 5-6 pips rule in consideration too. My math in pips for the day: 43-11+31= 63 pips. Thank you RAZ. Done for the day. Regards PH

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Whatfx, please, can you give an example of chart, with the break of the trap is by 5-6 pips or more and an example with the break is by say only 1-4 pips? Thanks vcary

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Just see it now. In my charts, that "trap" is 47 to 54, 7 pips wide, so... not a trap. I voided it. Join us at skype. Is away faster to answer. PH

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi. I cant post charts from my laptop. Generally if the price breaks the trap by 5-6 pips and the candle closes above (buy) / below (sell) the trap line, then that trade is likely to go into profit, as opposed to a trade where the break was by only 1-4 pips. You can manually check it on the charts yourself.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
whatfx, rule numbers 3 and 4 on page 1 are clear and are the retrace rules ie await a candle close above/below the trap level and enter AT the level (or better.) In order to do the latter, u must have a retrace

--- 帖子 #609 ---
sure. if a retrace occurs, then you enter another half position. otherwise you still have your original half position open, entered at price break of 5-6 pips from trap. you dont wait for a retrace to enter the original half position.. just a break of 5-6 pips...

--- 帖子 #610 ---
My response was in regard to this post. With Raz rules there is no IF . With your own adaptation, u can of course do whatever floats your boat.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Raz, I want to thank you for sharing this with everyone so generously. I love the simplicity of how it works and quite reliable. I have always been very suspect of indicators, leading or lagging, and have been searching for something which more closely shadows the actual price movement as it does whatever it's going to do. I wish you much success.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hopefully this week starts better off then last week. Although last week I netted positive gains, it was a rough start. However I am ready. If you have asked me while I was offline to be added to the room, don't hesistate to message me again in skype, and I will get you back into the room. Have fun this week

--- 帖子 #613 ---
does anyone see any traps, i cant at the moment..?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
We are in the middles of a trade that Phneutral actually called out for us. So I took his trap this time, and thus far we are doing well. It was upper 1.3632 Lower 1.3615 So far holding long well, will look for more traps

--- 帖子 #615 ---
This was Phneutral's call on Trap. I chanced it with him, and he came through for us, gj my friend!

--- 帖子 #616 ---
i grabbed a few pips. entered at 13652 closed 13672. not a trap, but i traded the breakout. +20 pips, ok start to the day.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
this was a very difficult one to spot. but valid nonetheless. well done ph..!

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I took this trade, but got out manually with only +18 pips (thought the price started reversing). Could get 30 pips easily. We live and we learn...

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Trap 1: Winner for +35

--- 帖子 #620 ---
gj Ph!

--- 帖子 #621 ---
this trade followed my rule of breaking above by 5-6 pips, and then closing above, before doing a retrace. it also followed your rule of a retrace to the trap line. this was an example of an ideal trade. you can almost guarantee this trade would work and you can slam those pips. when the above scenario occurs, the trade is yours to nail !

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Trade 2: Looser, -18

--- 帖子 #623 ---
GJ, now for clarification I trade purely on price retracing back to entry line, but again this is me. Others have adapted to taking more trades on orders or variations of closes out of entry line. That is purely on how you want to trade and experiment.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
I saw this trade but didn't take it. Obviously H-1 trend reversed and I decided to take only short trades for a while.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
So, I tried to eye a price trap, not sure if I got it right though. Plz let me know, any constructive criticism is welcome. Attached Image (click to enlarge) that circled area is a potential entry point, due to a clear bear bar outside the trap

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Trap 3: Looser -13

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Trap 4: looser -17

--- 帖子 #628 ---
this ones trap would have been difficult to establish. too many spikes on trap lines. without any precise levels of rejection. i would leave such trades out...

--- 帖子 #629 ---
You are right. Kind of forced. Will have attention on that.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Its ok. I only put lower level 1 pip down. PH

--- 帖子 #631 ---
In your "ideal" trade, Could you please clarify your 5-6pip rule (or observation): A) Are you refering to the breakout bar (ie breakout from the trap) Do you enter immediately half your position then? or B) Are you looking at the high point after the breakout - just before the pull back to the breakout level of the trap. If this is the case, how many bars would be ideal or the maximum no of bars allowed? Thanks and Cheers.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
is this a new trap at 1.3605 1.3585 ?!

Hi Guys Have a question which I hope someone could answer. Lets say we have a trap and break to the upside, price moves away and we wait for retrace. Now, price moves back and goes below top of trap, at what point do we put the trade on? Do we do it now and risk trade carrying on down, or do we now wait for price again to exit trap to topside and buy at market ? Hope this makes sense as am bit confused as to where to enter. Kind Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #640 ---
The signal you're waiting for when it breaks to the upside is to retrace into the trap. The goal is obviously to buy as low as possible. So, what I do is follow it down. The first time it moves to go back up, I figure that's as far as it is safe to push it, and that's when I buy. The same principle applies in reverse when it breaks to the downside.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
To listen in on the discussion, I have headphones. But, I don't have a mic. So, what exactly is the format? Do I really need to talk? (I tend to talk too much anyway.)

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Math for today: +35-18-13-17-22+27+43+27+23 = + 85 pips We make some good decisions there at skype, many good traders there. Today was a hell of a day and tired now. I will try to keep updates but is getting harder as we are talking more there. Still, i think it is understood from all the examples how it works. Regards PH PS: Calisto, we only wrote there.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I dont have a mic for Skype, it is just purely a chatroom.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Thanks Callisto, understand now. Geoff

--- 帖子 #645 ---
I am starting to notice quite of few habits from people in the skype room. I wanted to clarify two things, because it is very important to understand. As soon as I log on and get loaded up in the skype room I am starting to see members calling out traps with in the first few minutes after the Euro session has open. This to me tells me that either you are so eager to trade that you are seeing what may be possibly a trap or you are not certain at what traps are. Which is fine, because I am here to help you learn what I see. However like I have said before that I usually look for 2 to 3 good solid traps a night. I dont like to expose my self to the market so much. Second thing is after last night I notice we had some people in the room that were new, and when we all took a live a trade. Some of the members were encouraging others to take the trade. To me this is a little reckless in teaching. If you aren't certain why others are trading, please do not trade. Demo or trade very small lots, until you grow comfortable. I still want to keep this educational. However last night it was perfect example of others being a little reckless. Please trading is risky business, and I take my risk for me. If others are in a trade, does not mean that you should blindly take a live trade. There will be plenty of more trading opportunities in the future.

Since the H-1 trend is up, I decided to take only long trades for a while. It was a small trap, 11 pips high, but I set TP 30 pips as I always do, and it got hit in 20 minutes.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
just got up from bed ! missed the trades. phn - the chart you have shown does not meet the criteria i came up with, i.e. the break and price movement below must be at least 5-6 pips. so iam not surprised it was a looser. i would not have taken this trade.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hi Alex. To join the skype chat room, you have to sign in to skype. Once you are in, click on the contacts tab at the top. A new window will open which says 'Add a contact'. Here you type in, raz_4xpips then press 'find' button. Then you close the window and you will see 'Michael 'raz' Sargent' in your contacts list. You can then contact Raz from there, asking him to add you to the room. Hope this helps Pete.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
I don't see here any legit trap. And I also think that the up-trend could be close to the end.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
The early bird catches the worm! I think it is not because not meeting your criteria. It was such a nice, good, 180+ pips trend - you just can't go against trend like this, you'll lose 9 times out of ten.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Not the best day for the system, so far I entered only one trade (showed it in the post #649) and got +30 pips. That's good, but not great! Was anybody more lucky than I was? Fortunately I scalped Euro all morning long with another system. Is it a wishful thinking or the trap is forming right now?

--- 帖子 #657 ---
The trap 1.3800/1.3777. Entered at 8:19 EST Euro 1.37695, but the price turned against me almost immediately, so I exited with a small profit +13.3 pips. Altogether 43.3 pips from the system, not a bad day, not bad at all!

my bad, i thought it was "price tag", didnt realise its a trap after price

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hi PH - Good to see you hammering away at those price traps! I have a couple of questions about your trading... 1. Do you filter your trades based on the general trend or an MA? 2. Are you trading right through the European session, maybe also the US session? Any thoughts on the best times to trade? Do you think Raz's three hour slot is still the best? 3. Have you been keeping any stats on how the trades are working out? If not, do you have a rough idea? 4. Do you stick to Raz's trade management (i.e. take profit twice the stop + 3 PIPs etc.) or do you use your own? 5. Do you mark up any pivot levels or resistance levels from higher time frames to help your trades? Thanks for your time PH. PB

--- 帖子 #663 ---
1. I don't (Maybe I should). But we do it yesterday on skype and i must say it was a good thing... 2. I don't care about the hours, just trade UK and US and lunch in the middle. Stop about 6PM GMT. 3. I only consider to do this thing reasonably a few days,so... I,ve been posting results of that. ( I only trade this at a week and a half ) 4. Sometimes i personalize it with BE's when we are about 70% of the winning way. 5. Look only at some few trendlines at the 15 minutes. (maybe a should use those lines too) Anyway, I just do it as RAZ although sometimes we don't see the same traps. But i always fallow him straight when he is around, and got much to learn with him. Method is simple as he states and he only looks at price action too. Regards PH

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I had to miss this session and maybe I'll have to miss the next session (family matters). whatfx, I used to scalp M1/M5 with stochastics, the results were pretty good, but it was very stressful, you have to watch M1/M5/M15/M30 at the same time, so I can't recommend this method. The last couple of weeks I scalp M1 with VQ indicator. The thread is here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=310545 I use a histogram-modification of VQ: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...73#post4887673 The topic-starter claims 90% winnings. I'm not that good, but I have 70%+ (maybe because I trade only H-1 trend's direction and pay attention to the PA). I should start it earlier, it is a great system, but my broker doesn't allow TP/SL less than 10 pips. Finally I decided to use SL 10 and don't set TP, exit manually. Sorry for the off-top, it won't happen again!

Just want to leave a message here, i quit the skype group couldn't handle the new guys each day asking the same question over and over again, when all answers are in the first post... the conversation was more of a alert ''raz '' system than trying to learn by ourself thing... however system is ''ok'' the main problem IMHO is not caring about higher tfs exemple : [14/10/2011 08:1X:XX] HISNAME : Mini-trap at 66-68, I move sl to 69 Fred Mercier

Resume of the day: +23-5-12+29-23-7 = 5 pips , almost BE again. Resume of the week: About + 12.5% for the week, risking about 2 to 4% in each trade. (It depends of the size of the trap). Maybe I should fix the risk, don't got conclusions about it yet. Not awesome results, but positive results. Some conclusions about this system: 1) Seems to work both in UK and US sessions. 2) Watch out for a trap long at resistance as well as a trap short at support. Those ones tend to be looser's. 3) Don't trade it if it passes 11:30 GMT or 17:30 GMT. Take a break from 11:30 to 13:30. If I had made those 3, i'll be in the +20% territory for the week. There will be more next week. Have a good weekend! PH

--- 帖子 #688 ---
phneutral- Hello my friend. That 12.5% is amazing!! If you could consistently make that amount every week, that is more than a 50% balance increase every month!!! If you do the math, it is more than $2 MILLION after only 12 months-The best part? That is starting with only a $1000 balance.

Hi Guys Been following this awesome thread and love the price trap for entry. Hows this one sit with you guys? I think its almost perfect and I'm looking to short it, so might take a crafty short at top of trap risking handful of pips then get to break even super quick before price reaches bottom of trap and see what happens. Hopefully price will fall out the bottom for 50 plus pips. All the best Clive.

Hello fellow traders. As most of you may know I am in the middle of my move to my condo. As much as I miss trading, I really can't wait to finish this move. I am getting my computer setup tonight, however it may look like I may miss another night, but no worries plenty of trading to come. I appreciate all that have been very supportive in my time away. Once I return, I hope to regain a little more strict order with the skype room. Again hang in there, and I will be on either tonight, or tommorrow for sure. Ras

Traps 7, 8 and 9; - 2- 15 = -17

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Sum of today: -13-20-20+27+5-17 = -38 Worst losing day ever with this method. There's more tomorrow. PH

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Like i said last Friday, today is bearish, so just looking for bear signals. I got only 2 Short trades +70pp. That's all for today.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
yeah m8 it was a downtrend, be carefull plz! Thnx for all the scrnshots

--- 帖子 #710 ---
One good trade for today. Trap formed after Frankfurt open. Sell 1,37444 . Stop loss 1,3760 take profit 1,3710 Take profit hit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Yea....took the same one myself...

--- 帖子 #712 ---
the system needs to be enhanced to prevent fake breakouts. filters are required. as it stands i dont feel it will yield good profits in the long run. just an opinion.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
There's no such thing as a fake breakout. Price either breaks out or it doesn't. Once price breaks out according to a system's rules the real question is how far will it go. Unless you can come up with a filter that can predict the future you'll just have to manage trades as they come. OP is looking for 2:1 reward:risk. With that reward:risk, as long as your win rate is &gt; 30% you have positive expenctancy.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hi Whatfx! with reference to your thread above, I have not seen you since September 28, are you still searching the best system or you found it. Waiting for reply with good news. take care, Sevenskies

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hi, PH, no more updates???

--- 帖子 #716 ---
I have been in the process of moving, so I am on tonight to. Having minor glitches but I am ready to start trading again. Thanks for all who have stuck with this thus far, and we shall see where we can take this further

--- 帖子 #717 ---
hi i dont want divert from this thread, but i have finished the list, just need the time to write it up..

--- 帖子 #718 ---
i took 1 by the rules, lets see what happends

--- 帖子 #719 ---
yes it was a winner +33 pips

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I see in the #1 post, is says channels must be a minumum of 9-23 pips wide from top to bottom. What is the maximum though? Did you mean 23 pips is the maximum amount before a channel is too big?

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Yes, 9 pips is the minimum and 23 pips is the maximum.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
The price rejection in that trap doesn't look steep enough to me. You might have just gotten lucky that time. Can someone else look at this and let me know if I'm wrong here? I don't want to discourage anybody, and I'm still kinda new to this system myself.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Since Raz came up with this system maybe he can advise. I had an idea that might clear up the subject of what is price rejection and what isn't. Some type of guideline formula. For instance: Price must move up or down X number of pips within Y minutes. Any less is not price rejection according to this system.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
With all the move that I have been dealing with I am sorry that I haven't been on the thread that much. However I hope to get things back to normal soon. I see that we still have some people that still posting here. I will try and clarify the details, and repost in post #1. I know overtime I have explained other things as things go on. Ihor did a good demonstration in picture perfect setup on how the setups work. The Risk to Reward is strictly upto you guys, but again I stick to how I trade it

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Rejection to me is when price quickly shoots in the opposite direction of a certain level, thus greating an upper or lower level. If price hits and area and sticks there for a few minutes, I usually dont count it to be price rejection.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
i think it was a good trade, because it was rejected 3 times and the fourth time it went trough the bottom

--- 帖子 #727 ---
does anyone have a collation of results so far as to how this system has performed since inception...

--- 帖子 #728 ---
hi whatfx, I see you in so many threads, and posting a lot, mean you look for a good system, but never trade, here is your opportunity: please focus your time and do this homework for us, trade the system for a month and give us the results. thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Here is a picture of a 23 pip wide 11 candle trap. Price has just retraced back to the bottom of it. Is this not enough candles yet though? Too early to call it a strong trap? Is there a minimum number of rejection you want to see? I only saw one V rejection per side then it went through the bottom and is now retracing back to it.?

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Well wether my price trap was exemplary or not it worked out. Came within a hair of getting stopped and then went to my TP and I locked it in with postive SL, and got stopped at +41 pips.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Sorry, but most of us have migrated to the skype room, and I know everyone wants results, but that is purely on individual performance. Even Phneutral is now posting in skype, and modifying the method to his best use. Last night I took 3 trades, lost the first, and won the other 2. Netted 8.9% gain last night so a very good night for me. I will try and back post the live trades I took over the 3hours that I trade.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
GJ, trap must have minium of 9 pips, and I post a pic of the last valid trap I took last night, and woke up to a winning trade. Count the candles starting where the first circle is.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
This was last trade last night taken, and I believe alot of us got in and took it and made some pips. I read back in the skype room and think some got a little scared and shortened r:r, but I was asleep so didnt matter to me.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
What do you think about my trap above? I marked it's start with a vertical line, and the bottom and top with two horizantal. In that pic price is just under or at the bottom.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
While I've got the op here. I just want to re ask him the same question I aksed earlier. 23 pips is the max size for a price trap that you use/allow?

--- 帖子 #736 ---
correct, but some others are trading traps in the realm of 35 pips, but that is strictly on them

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Ok, now I dont feel bad about the 26 pip trap I just set. What brought you to a 23 pip max trap?

--- 帖子 #738 ---
My second trap is working out so far. (26 pip) Dropped to +30 or so, locked in BE, because if it goes all the way back to entry, I think it will zoom up. Entered inside the trap, so, if it goes to my TP I stand to make about 60 pips. Well, I'm convinced. 2 trades two winners. Just locked in +61 pips on my last short after it made a good pass past 1.3700. 2:1 ratio and easy to understand set ups with no idicators. I also noticed that on the 1H the SL for traps ends up being behind the last 1H candle, which often has a wich in favor of the trap, bonus. Thanks for showing me the light RAZ, now I can give up on my indicator based holy grail search and just trust price. P.S. Nice to have the 2:1 ratio, makes me not afraid of losses, I think the ratio is key in this method to making it profitable.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
As I enter the room of the group?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
whatfx, I'm not sure that anybody can give you what you want. For example, I trade both this system and another system from the same account, the first week I tested this system with 0.01 lot, after that I started trading it with a full lot. Considering this and considering another system I can't tell you the account growth percentage. I'm too lazy to go through all the trades and count all the pips. I have my daily goal and that's what is important for me (and I try to get it with two different systems), I don't care about all other statistics. All I can say is: in almost 4 weeks I have only three small losses, 11, 8 and 10 pips. But I trade only in the H-1 trend's direction and I exit with the small profit/small loss when price turns against me, I also trade both euro and pound. Everything else I do according to the raz's rules.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I just like to make my money fast, since I risk 2% per trade regardless of trap size, I just feel that markets swing in the area of 20 to 50 pips before retracing, and therefore I wanted to stay with in that realm. Personally I like 12 to 14 pip trap sizes the best, of course the lower the trap the size the better for two reasons. Take profits usually hit much faster, and the bonus pips affect the acct more. Just how I have seen it

--- 帖子 #742 ---
remember this method has no regard to new sigs, fib points, trend lines, daily pivots. Not to say that any of things are not important, but give it time and you will see how price starts to move day after day.

Hi Raz Could you please take a look at the chart in post 733. I need some clarification. The trap was 7 bars from first green circle to third green circle (11pips wide) – 14 bars to breakout of trap. Looking at Ihor diagram – it states that the first and third circle should be at least 11bars apart – if this is the case, this setup should not have been taken, is this correct? Or am I missing something??? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #750 ---

--- 帖子 #751 ---
and last

--- 帖子 #752 ---
when I get home I will add you, you dont have to be quiet by any means. But you will know when someone in there is asking stupid questions, or being stupid on purpose. I just wont tolerate it. I am very helpful once you get to know me, but when you come in and start posting things like. Long 1.3768 And everyone is like... What? What trap? Where? So you will be fine RAZ

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Good question, the actual rejection has to occur. Once we have valid rejection points, then price must sit anywhere within trap for at least 11 candles which it does. You can have \/ like rejection or /\ rejection in 6 mins, but as long as price sits within in the price levels(or we call the trap) at least 11 mins long. Longer is always better, then we call it 'Valid"

--- 帖子 #754 ---
The rejection points is what dictates our upper and lower levels, and that is it. Probably the true challenge to this method. As long as price stays with in those rejection points and at least 11 mins or longer then this validates a 'trap'

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I know this has been asked before, but I didn't see an answer. Is there anything you use to pick a long or short bias for a trap? Or do you just take the trade, whichever side gets a close above/below the trap?

--- 帖子 #756 ---
ok if you read the thread, I will repeat. I never stated long or short bias for a trap. Once price rejection occurs, and we have established a 'valid' trap then we look for a clean close above the upper level, to signal a long position, or a clean close below the the lower level to signal a short position.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Ok, just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
I am not tolerating people coming into the price trap room with close to over 85 members watching and 49 actively chatting to see questions like "what is a trap?' See you all later tonight

--- 帖子 #759 ---
No problem, that is what this forum is for

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hi Raz good thread, i have made an add request for your skype, this is something very similar i was experimenting with sometime back, very good approach my skype id sami29uk cheers sami

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Hi ph....have you any charts with todays updates?..I could not get onto skype for some reason....

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Thank you for taking the time to answer and clarifying - really appreciate it. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
A quick question Raz ( I'm having problems getting into Skype but I'll sort it out )...when your looking at rejection points are you looking at the area of rejection say with 2 or 3 pips or the exact tip of wicks? T

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I wanted to clarify a few things going forward. The idea of this method by now has been fully explained and answered thus far in this thread. I am not abandoning forexfactory.com by any means, but the pure idea from the start of this was to teach the method, and of course give examples of it and demonstrate situations. Which I think by now it has been pretty well documented. With out clogging this thread anymore with tons of post to make it almost unreadable having numerous pages to thumb through can seem somewhat overwhelming at times. However I am ending pretty much my post from here going forward, but does not mean that I will pop in time to time to answer here and there. I am going back to a normal trading style, where I trade this live with real money and of course I still have the skype room active, but I didnt want to have too much to manage anymore. Time for me to continue and make money, but if you want to trade it live with me during the times I trade then feel free to jump on in skype room with me and we can trade it live together, but you must know the method first before just jumping right in. I feel that the body of work has been explained, and there shouldn't be any further explanations as to how I trade this method anymore in this thread. The method works well with me, and I have no problem helping others trade it with me. So I appreciate all that have supported me on this little venture, and all those who were here actively posting examples and illustrations. I wasn't looking for a reward or expect anything from anyone. All I wanted to do was give back to FF all things I have gathered and share what works for me on a consistent basis. There are too many to name, and I did make a ton friends while starting this thread and the skype room. But time for me to leave this thread here for those who want to learn 'how' this method is traded. By the way if you can not get in me skype room, then send me a PM or e-mail and I will try and add you on. Remember I am only on for 3 hours 5 days a week during my specific hours.

Trap 3: TP hit : +23

Just took traps 1 and 3. I just want to trade the first 3 hours of US too. Best to your trading PH

--- 帖子 #772 ---
That actually does make things clearer for me, and I hope I didn't confuse anyone else in the process. Good trading, y'all!!

--- 帖子 #773 ---
I'm sure there's a few of us here that will stay on and try to answer questions. Me, personally, I like the forum format and I'm always making sure to perfect the knowledge I obtain. So, passing it on to others with your occasional supervision is perfect for me. I've become confident enough to start trading it live, and I'm looking forward to making some money with it. I can honestly say that if I lose money trading it live, it's my fault not the system. Good pip hunting, and all the best, my friend.

Hi all, Is this a valid 3 touches to form a trap? http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/1...eu28102011.jpg http://img838.imageshack.us/img838/1...eu28102011.jpg

--- 帖子 #781 ---
no it isnt. upper level not lining up correctly..

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Yes to answer some PMs that I am getting. I am still trading this live, but leaving this thread for learning the method purely. I still trade with a decent amount of members which have been with me nearly the beginning.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Edit: Sorry guys, I have decided to remove this script because it is not robust enough for general use. The reason I posted it was to allow the price levels to be displayed for ease of reading, but I have since found an old script that I have renamed TrapMeasure that I have uploaded in the next post that does the job much better and is more flexible in use. Apologies Raz for messing up your thread. Original Post: In response to a request by ZR in the Skype room today for a way to see the trap numbers in big letters, here is a script that I wrote for my own use that does the job. ZR as with all these things, it is not an exact match for your request, but it does allow you to see the numbers more clearly. This script has been written for my own personal use only so I have not made it robust, just good enough for my own purposes. If anyone finds it useful, then that is OK but I cannot guarantee its accuracy under all conditions - so don't rely on it for live trades. It's main use is simply to see the numbers for the trap for those with less than perfect vision and for me personally to calculate the lot size and target without having to do the mental arithmatic. This is a script so it needs to go into the scripts folder. The simplest way to use it is to have the navigator bar open, expand scripts and then drag and drop the script on the the bar that you want to be the first bar of the trap. The script then draws the trap starting at that bar and going the number of bars you set in the NumberOfBars property. If you enter a number larger than the number of bars available, (e.g.111) then it draws the trap starting at the drop bar to the bar before the currently forming bar. The numbers for long and short trades are displayed at the top and bottom of the screen. To make it simple to use, I suggest you edit the default values in the first 14 lines to suit the colours on you screen, account size and risk percentage to save you having to change these each time it is run. Drag and drop mode only works properly for traps of minimum 11 bars. If you want to draw a partial trap as it is forming, then instead of dragging and dropping the script, just double click the script and enter the number of bars back from the currently forming bar that you want to go, so say you are 8 minutes into the trap, then double click the script, enter 8 as the NumberOfBars and you will get what you are looking for. Edit: The number with the £ sign is for my own use and is the £ per pip value for the account size and risk percentage entered. I display this because I am using a spread betting broker so need to know the £pp rather than the lot size. Sorry for the inconvenience, you will just have to ignore it because I don't want to start changing the script every 5 minutes.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
This is the problem with personal scripts, there is always something that makes it unusable for general use. The first thing ZR pointed out within five minutes it that you can't delete it! So here is a script to delete it. Also ZR I have added a manual trap measure that will probably be more suited to your requirements - pity I didn't think of this first. Once loaded, you double click the lines and move them to where you want the trap to be and it displays the numbers. To remove this one you simply right click on the chart and select remove script.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Thank you very much Casey. I will try this out now.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
why isnt anyone discussing any weaknesses of this system and how to improve it. i thought this is what threads are for. its all good live trading on skype. but please discuss your findings here...for the benefit of everyone..

--- 帖子 #787 ---
sometime great thread starter show us a system that are already finish, some KISS version, there is no need to improve, only trade it same the Author tell you. many threads start this way but then come the EA people and the changer and improver, here a indie more and here a TF more for control and ...., and the system will never finish only confuse all and the people loosing the interest. the Forum and all the threads are not for people to improve the number of posting, it is all for improve your trading, use the time to trade. thanks very much Raz for this system we trade the finish version of Price-trap-system to live a wonderful life stress free trading of a KISS system cheers

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hey guys, Wonderful thread! Thank you Raz and everyone here for putting in the effort to help others. I wont waste time. Started reading and on page 31 so got some posts to get through yet, but I want to start demo and I'm eager to learn this method. So learning to id the traps as I read. I havent seen this addressed. and I hope I don't make a fool of myself, and apologize in advance if it has been. Leaving aside all other aspects of the trap (higher tf s/r, major trend, time of day etc..) do you give much consideration to how long the range has been going on for? Like in this chart, price has been in pretty tight consolidation for quite some time. is the trap marked in yellow still valid for an entry (either way on breakout). Thanks in advance and hope to see you in the Skype room soon. Michael Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Whatfx: I do appreciate you being a good part of this thread, but after seeing that you have been bouncing all over to various methods I think the one bit advice I can give you is this: The method works in the eyes of the user, but once it fails it never seems to amaze me everytime.... I get people left and right saying why dont we use Daily High or Daily Low? Why dont we use Montly Pivot? My answer has always been the same and consistent since day one. I personally dont mind criticism but however I have traded this for nearly 30 weeks straight and have never lost money. Becasuse you have had a bad stretch, it's easy to say we need to change it so it works better. But that is why you will never take that step closer to be a fully complete and confident trader. I never said my method was the best and that it was easy by any means. But if you trade for a long period of time and it has done nothing but generate money for you, why change what is simple and working. So again I dont care if you want to continue this or even modify it to fit your own personal gratification, but looking for someone else to pop out the answer for you and you not yourself going for it says to me that you are hoping one day you find the 'holy grail'

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Nope I care not to consider anything but trap size, my TP and SL, and the rest is meaningless to me

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Thanks, and it gets easier and easier week after week. I have had some members in the Skype room now can swallow back to back losers, and still feel confident the money is still coming, and by the end of the week it always does.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
WELL SAID!!! A couple of days ago I decided that I'm not going to test any new systems because I have everything I need ("Price Trap" and "VQ Trading System") right now! It is a great system! If it ain't broken - don't fix it!

--- 帖子 #793 ---
raz just to clarify matters i dont need to look for the holy grail. i use my own profitable trading systems that are highly profitable. already 34k up since march this year..... i may not be the most experienced or mature person on ff, but i know how to make pips, and iam doing so consistently every week. my account statements dont lie. can easily show them to you if you wish. i dont bounce from thread to thread, what i do is try to find the best systems here on ff so that i may add them to my own thread called ''best trading systems on forex factory'', a list that iam compiling. that is why you see me on many other threads, criticising and asking fundamental questions, albeit if some of them appear dumb. trying to find the best systems to add to my list. that is the only reason why i 'bounce' around as you state. otherwise iam already making good money with my own systems, i have no reason to look for the holy grail (which does not exist in my book). btw i dont just trade currencies, most of my huge profits have actually come from trading gold and stocks. my success rate on gold trades have been phenomenal. i manage to get the trades right almost all of the times. and that is not boasting. the last time i had a losing trade on gold was about 6 weeks ago. if you come on the gold thread, you will see the trades i take. as regards to using your system, i only used it briefly to test it out. have had mixed success with it. as iam far too busy using my own systems. however i do feel your system has potential. in conclusion, iam afraid you are totally wrong about me. for some reason i thought you were far better than making judgements on people. anyways, hope you make a success of your system in the long term. all the best.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Whatfx: First of all I do apologize for pulling the claim to search for the 'holy grail.' However I have stressed multiple times over and over that a method is never going to be 1 2 3, and then bam it works. That does not exist, every method must work for the user and take what they can adjust and make it better for him or her self. I have been trading for sometime, and have been on this forum for sometime. I only say this because I have seen so many people come and go and expect others to make things happen for them, if this does not apply to you then you shouldn't take any offense to it. However displaying your current success in forex, having a 34k acct or a 100k acct, or even a 1 million dollar acct. Stating that you make money doing gold, or delivering pizzas does not build credentials in my opinion. It shows that you have something to prove to others. Having to express this does mean you took offense to what I said, and again I do apologize. Great you are successful, and most proud for you. I do have a lot of personal friends who are forex traders that make well over 25K per month, but they would never in a heartbeat state that on ff or even entertain how much they make. If this method does not work for you or anyone then by all means close and move on. However having a list of best forext methods on ff is strictly a biased opinion, because what works for one will not certainly work for others. It's like asking if swimming vs running is best workout. The only thing I offered was to show a simple and yet consitent way to trade forex off of price action, but not only do I show the results I actually perform it live every night, and take the losses and wins as they develop. Not too many others traders out there can venture into that area, because it is so easy to talk about trades shortly after they have developed and mature. I am by no means trying to prove my worth, I know what I am capable of doing and making, and very comfortable with my personal finances in life and my lifestyle. Yet being on ff for many years now and seeing so many newb like actions, and the mutiple traders out there posting about how much they make and how much their acct bal. is has always shown one thing, you have something to prove. Well my suggestion do it for yourself and share if you want, but make sure that you are satisfied with your life and trading, and all is best to your success and trading.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
well, i do like to tell people when iam making money ! thats just the way iam. if i had a million pound to start off with, i too could possibly make 25k a month just like your friends.... the reason i bought up how much i made is simply because of what you had stated earlier which implied iam a cowboy trader. i cannot be a cowboy trader if iam making money now can i ? others may wanna be technically proficient, have huge credentials, but it means nothing to me if they cant make money. after all, that is why we are in forex, to make money right ? credentials dont mean much to me iam afraid. iam here to make money nothing else. so as long as iam making money, i will be happy. point made. i will be in touch in the furture .....will keep you informed of my success and perhaps you could tell me then how well you have done yourself ? anyways, leave you to it.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Hi Raz, We used to trade the Raz Method together, nice to see you back on FF. I have read the first 10 sites and its really a very good strategy, stay on the horse, i wish you good luck, i think u had the target to become a millionair with small steps in 5 years or so, i hope you can reach this goal even if it takes a little longer. In the end everybody has to find his own way but one thing for sure, consistency is key. iTrader

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Hi there, I have benn checking your method out with interest. Are you still on skpe - I could not locate you on it. May you give me instructions how to come to your skpe room.

I have been finding with some back testing and some live trades -- that this system is not doing too many 2 - 1 ratio returns. It seems it is more like 1.5 - 1 or even 1-1. This with the market being so up and down lately. Anyone also finding the same? Cheers.

as i stated in one of my earlier posts, my opinion is that the system on its own will not make you pips in the long run. you really need to enhance it to suit your style, add filters etc.

Hi Whatfx, I understand that you are frustrated because the system is not improving. Improving a trading system means adding filters to prevent the fakes. Filters are indicators. This is what RAZ does not want. One of the main aspects of RAZ's system is that it is naked, with no indicators. Nevertheless, everybody can use filters, indicators, modifications at his own discretion without messing up the thread. I have read the whole thread and done few hours of practice with the past charts. If I decide to go live with this system, I will definitely go with the major trend (H1 &amp; H4) only, will have weekly pivots, and will have main Fibo levels on the charts. Please also remember, the market is extremely choppy, sloppy, and jumpy. Moreover, we are in December. It is a horrible time to trade. No EA, no system holds in this environment. Keep your trades and lot sizes to the minimum if you can. With this system, 2012 will be a good year. :-)

I stumbled across something that might help in case anyone is having trouble figuring this thing out. This system is essentially a very refined version of a very simple and timeless fx strategy. You can find it here: http://www.bestfxtradingsystems.com/ Look for what he calls the 123 MW system. His explanations are simple and easy to learn. Master that and then come back here and add Raz's refinements. It will be much easier to get the hang of it. GOOD LUCK AND MASS PIPS TO ALL!

We often jump from startegy to strategy. This thread looks very quiet now, no leader here so people dont have confidence to trade.

Hi Raz, I don't know if you every check on this thread since you stated you no longer trade this method, but I have used this method since discovering it &amp; I wanted to say it has been working for me, but as you stated it can be unpredictable at times according to the pair you are trading. This is not my main method that I trade, but I use it at times. Favorite made a good suggestion about using the one 1 Hr time frame to keep you with the trend &amp; I also use that, but no indicators at all. I want to say thank you for sharing with your fellow traders &amp; I hope whatever method you are using is working well for. Best wishes for you in 2015 my friend.

Hello all.. This thread is very interesting, because the O.P. is clearly frustrated as to the lack of stability of his entries. I would like to point something out to you which may change your opinion on this setup. 1) If you are trading the 1m chart, the wicks which you see is meerly a representation of what we call the "tick chart". Instead of setting buy/sell stop orders at what you have seen as the high or low, why not open the trade once the price closes ACROSS the high or low. If you do so, then you are entering on what would be an ENGULF if the last known high or low, which of course would be a confirmed extension or reversal. 2) Understanding the dynamics of the 1m will actually help you a lot in getting an accurate entry. So say you have several rejections to the upside at say 1.23002 Once a 1m candle (no matter how long it is) closes across 1.2302 then you SHOULD take the long, with your sl being a CLOSE under the low of the candle which you entered in. -------------------------------------------------------- http://prntscr.com/5odye1 -------------------------------------------------------- Please click the link above, and have a look at how it applies to rule number 1 and rule number 2. 1) The blue box is the high after the first color change. 2) You then see we get a close across that price (red arrow pointing up) so there you buy. 3) Next candle ENGULFS it (red arrow pointing down) 4) And from then it never looks back as it attacks the low. Everyone on 1m should be based on closes and not pending orders. You will end up getting caught in whip lashes, and if you are a bias trader you will end up holding positions which you shouldn't. Remember that 1m and tick charts are the mothers of everything you see on 5m and higher. It is impossible for a trend on the 1h chart to reverse if it has not done so first on the 1m. Should you find the information I have provided helpful it would be my pleasure to continue to add more information in your quest to 1m chart domination.

There is nothing wrong with your system, Forex is unpredictable!

I'd say you are correct about it being unpredictable, but most people are trying to predict tops and bottoms, and following saying that the TREND IS YOUR FRIEND, instead of respecting RULES which are held in the time frame that is mentioned in this thread.
