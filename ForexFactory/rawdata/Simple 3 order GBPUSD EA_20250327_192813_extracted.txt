Following on from the Simple H1 GBPUSD EA thread, this is a version of the same EA that places 3 orders instead of 2, you can see the history of this EA at this link:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650

This version places 3 orders each with its own TP and one general stoploss.

TP1 and TSL are the same value so that the other two orders are fully protected once TP1 is reached.

TP2 uses a trailing stoploss and moves to breakeven when TP1 is reached.

TP3 is allowed to run without a TSL but its stoploss is moved to +10 when TP1 is reached.

The stoploss is 140 per order so the total risk is 420 pips, please don't use this EA if this is a problem.

All the settings were arrived at using the MT4 optimising tool, any changes will give different results!

camvcvooV5.ex4

V5 fixes trading with ECN accounts.

Default setting (for highest profits):
TP1 22, TP2 50, TP3 80, SL 140, TSL 22.

More coservative settings (for fewest losses):
TP1 14, TP2 50, TP3 100, SL 130, TSL 14.

__________________________________________________________
canvcvoo requested this version so, for now the file is in his name.

There is also a full strategy report attached.

NOTE:
It is very important that the GMT offset for your broker is set correctly.

This EA places its orders during the hour before Tokyo opens, if you do not set the broker to

GMT offset correctly the EA will not show good results.

This EA is provided for educational purposes only and anyone downloading  and using  the EA does

so entirely at their own risk and they are responsible  from any losses they may incur from using

it in live trading.

Geoff,

Thank you very much for this version i requested.

I will update my live forward test as from next week.

Let's hope this thread will attract many talents to improve this EA like the other thread of yours.

Remember, all credits go to Geoff, the originator of this idea.

Many pips to all.

Cheers.

Holy cow! I've backtested it: 100% profit

I'm firing this baby live this night. Thanks geoff, you're da man!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi Emanuele

I have just run it on the optimiser and found that TP3 can be increased to 80, it was 50 default and this gives a bigger overall profit!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
What the .....!

Your post really drives me crazy and as if i can withdraw profits from my broker's account already!

Let's hope we all benefit from this version.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I can see my account with my broker getting bigger and bigger!

Geoff, you rocks

Thank you very much

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #7 ---
How about giving the thread some stars in the rating!

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Great Job Geoff.. I will demo this one for a bit and see how it goes...  I still prefer the default V7.  But with such a high hit rate, a 3rd TP might not be bad idea

Will check it out

--- 帖子 #9 ---
That's how the backtesting graph looks like. Awesome. I think I'll just quit my crappy manual trading and let this wonder run on its own.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Guess what?

Just voted 6 Stars but was rejected, so i settled for 5 Stars. Hope you don't mind.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
i am downloading it from attachment (top right), i got a zip file thats empty. anyone has same problem ?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I, too, struggle with my manual trading. It gets into the habits of a gambler which is very scary. I am trying to overcome the issue of over-trading and getting too emotional.

I guess with this EA, all these problems with go away.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Geoff,

Thanks for your generosity and help for the people.

I will back test this tonight and do a demo run tonight and will post the results tomorrow...

Keep it up ...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
5 will do nicely, thank you!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Once TP1 is hit the other 2 trades are protected!

Only problem is when all three bomb!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I just tried it and got 1.04Mb zip file!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Well I suppose I won't mind trading a 99% profit EA!

Looking forward to seeing more from this EA.

Well done guys!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
1st of all thanks for this EA.

I was wondering when backtesting this ea, what period of TF do you use?is it 1m,5m or 15m?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Yeah! Only 99% its a bummer!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
This EA only runs on H1 GBPUSD, no other pair, no other time frame!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Sorry for the noob question but I'm really not used to backtesting: what are the numbers on the horizontal line and vertical line of the backtest graph?

Also have you got a back test result with TP3 at 80?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Vertical is $, start at 2000 going above 8000.

Horizontal is the number of trades.

I don't  have a chart for TP3 at 80, it looks just the same but the end figure is closer to 9000.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
On average does this EA enter once every day, 2 days, 3 days... ?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Here is the result using High Risk (5%) setting MM.

Starts with $5000 ends over $42000 in 12 months.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi Again,

Im using alpari metatrader for this ea and I keep getting this error in my journal.

2010.05.11 15:10:21    TestGenerator: unmatched data error (volume limit 4893 at 2010.05.06 21:00 exceeded)

what does it mean?

thanks

--- 帖子 #26 ---
In the back test it traded 144 days in the year, before you ask, I don't know how many trading days there are in a year!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Wow incredible! Makes me wanna use a "Special Stupid High Risk Setting" of 20%!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Back test it first with it set to your equity value, MM won't do much good below $5000 account size and even one loss could blow your account if it happens early in the test!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Geoff,

I guess it must be 96 days = 288 trades / 3.

That also fits to your 2 lot version that has 192 trades in the 1 year backtest.

Sorry to correct you!

Greetings,

Olarion1975

5 Stars - Well Done for another great EA

Paul

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Many thanks Paul!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
That is impressive!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Good job Geoff,

It will be good for every one who is going to live the EA to change Magic Number your own unique one and order comments also. So orders should look different for every trader and broker.

Not necessary but just my 2 cents...!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
is it possible to backtest this for last 3 years instead of just 1 year ?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
There is absolutely no point in that!

In fact I am wary of back tests as long as 1 year, the market changes so quickly, the best we can do is to closely monitor the performance in forward testing and adjust the settings as the market changes!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
sure but the results wont b as good.  it has been optimized for the past year. not 3 years.   that is whats wrong with using optimized ea's.  only good for a certain market condition then must b changed.

one thing to consider when optimizing ea's is to optimize for past month then use best settings for current month.  backtest that way and you will get more accurate results of what ea should really do.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Very true, as always kijkij!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I agree!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi geoffb,

thank you, you are god

I voted 5 stars:  Your vote on this thread has been added.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Oh thank you!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I'm on forward test! Lets take a ride...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
It's the only way, onwards and upwards!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi geoffb,

will camvcvoo work currently with V7?

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Yes, just make sure that the magic number is different from v7!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Which of those 2 EA's are giving the best results? v7 or camvcvoo?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
camvcvoo, but you need a pretty big account to trade it

--- 帖子 #47 ---
V7 is one week old and camvcvoo is one day old!

In back testing camvcvoo is the most profitable but also the most risky!

V7 is excellent, so far!

Take your choice.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Are 0.1 lots for a 1000 dollars account good enough or should I try something lower? Since it's pretty risky I should maybe adapt the lotsize properly.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I am using 0.1 on a $1000 micro account but you are correct this way too risky!

However, my account is one that I use only for testing new EA's so it is not so important to me.

If this was an account that I was hoping to make good, I would be using 0.01 lots, the minimum for an Alpari micro account!

Then, I like watching paint dry!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I'm going to stick with 0.06 lots for now. Thanks for your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Nice compromise!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
What I would do:

We know that a loss can be 420 pips. Convert in $ and this amount must not exceed 2 or 5% of capital, depending on the amount of risk you are willing to take.

Example: use 0,01 (micro) lots with 1400$ account an you'll be trading quite safely with 3% risk.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
This EA looks to be profitable only from end of April 2009 onwards.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Geoff

thanks for all your work

Is it possible in CAMVCVOO to reset the choice "hide targets" like in V7?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
No, I had to remove that option for now at least, it is rather dangerous in my opinion, I prefer to send the SL & TP data with the order especially with three orders to monitor!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
We're not using it before April 2009!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
That is exactly how the MM calculates the Lot size!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I'm keeping live v5b, v7 and added the 3 order EA on Alpari UK. Now, I hope only my account wont be blasted this night with all this kids playing together.

So far I had only one loser with v6, let's hope it will keep going well. Though, I realise this strategy may have an end somehow when the markets will change again.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
It's doubtful if v7 and the 3 order EA's will trade tonight, the 197 SMA is pointing down and the 10 SMA is pointing up, neither looks like it will have enough time to reverse so that will mean no trade!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
True. Though, I think v5 might open some trade tonight.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
The UK has a new right wing prime minister, Cameron has been confirmed so cable should start to recover, maybe.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
not that the previous one was particularly left leaning.

pretty much same shit different day

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I like the addition of the break even on positions 2 and 3....

Looks like I may have to go and order that new car sooner then I thought..

Just gave you max star's....for doing a great job..

--- 帖子 #64 ---
to EA's

Should there be a smiley face in upper right instead of X?

Left all at default except gmt +3 and lot size.

ty

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Yes. To enable it, you should see a button called Expert Advisor on the menu bar at the top of your trading platform. Click to make it green. Then you should see the smiling face. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thanks!  Now i have a face, but a frowny face.  Missing a file or something?  It is showing all the settings and such now on chart.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
It's hard to see where you have gone wrong. Maybe you can post your settings of the EA, then we can go from there. Alternatively, before you post, check for possible errors under the tab of Expert or Journal at the bottom of your trading terminal.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Is there a point of keeping the EA on?  Since I seen others talk about that V7 wont probably trade tonight?   When do we turn the EA off?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Wel, i didn't change any settings except 3 for gmt offset and .01 for lots.

In the experts it says successfully but frowny   lol.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Make sure:

Money Management = False

Manual Lot Size= True

Lot Size = Minimum required by your broker

If the above don't work, i am clueless.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
so nobody wants to answer the

"2010.05.11 16:44:18TestGenerator: unmatched data error (high value 1.4557 at 2009.01.14 06:00 is not reached from the least timeframe, high price 1.4557 mismatches)"

???

can anybody be generous enough on how to fix this problem?

Thanks a lot in advance

--- 帖子 #72 ---
didn't find the 6 star.....so I had to go with the 5 star....shall we open a sperate thread for the vol indicator too?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
make sure the following are set:

allow live trading

allow dll imports

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Can anyone other than the thread starter vouch for this system? Meaning, is it consistent and profitable?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
its only a day or two old.

for details of profitability of the old system and settings, read the thread.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
There is a small bug in the closing code of Order 3. The EA closes 3 also once the takeprofit2 is reached. It may need to be as follows (modification highlighted in bold).

for (int l = 0; l < OrdersTotal(); l++) {

OrderSelect(l, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_TRADES);

if (OrderType() == OP_BUY && (OrderMagicNumber() == iMagicNumber3)) {

if (Bid < (OrderOpenPrice()-StopLoss*Poin)

|| Bid > (OrderOpenPrice()+TakeProfit3*Poin)) {

RefreshRates();

OrderClose(OrderTicket(), OrderLots(), Bid, 3, Green);

}

}

if (OrderType() == OP_SELL && (OrderMagicNumber() == iMagicNumber3)) {

if (Ask > (OrderOpenPrice()+StopLoss*Poin)

|| Ask < (OrderOpenPrice()-TakeProfit3*Poin)) {

RefreshRates();

OrderClose(OrderTicket(), OrderLots(), Ask, 3, Yellow);

}

}

}//end for

--- 帖子 #77 ---
you rock brother, that did it!  Thanks a bunch.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Looks like i am not that experience after all.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Geoff

I've looked a few times already but I can't see where to vote for the thread. Where do I go??

--- 帖子 #80 ---
was the ability to hide TP and SL left out on purpose?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I cant speak for Geoff, but I assume it may have been because it was causing a few issues with computers either being turned off or disconected and therefore trade's running with no TP or SL...a few had good trade's turn into bad trade's...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Scroll up to the top of the page far right you will see rating.....its a dropdown with all the stars...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Calstock is correct, when hide_targets is used we rely on the EA alone to manage TP & SL as well as TSL, with 3 trades to monitor I decided that it could be quite a dangerous method.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thank you for spotting that, guess I missed it!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Good evening...Geoff

or morning in your case...

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Good morning camvcvoo!

What a shame we didn't get a trade today!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Good morning from me!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Good morning to you, Geoff.

There's always tomorrow. Like Jacko always says:"I didn't lose any money!"

Victor V

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Yes, the less often I trade the less often I lose!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I think if we just want action, v5b can do the job.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I just backtested this EA.  Doesn't seem profittable.  Anyone making money with this one?  Best results I'm getting over a few months is even.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
If you want comments on your post you will need to give us more details so we can compare your results to ours and find out what you are doing wrong!

--- 帖子 #93 ---
No trades over here last night, as previewed by Geoff.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Good morning Emanuele!

--- 帖子 #95 ---
'morning mate!

I was backtesting your wonders on other pairs last night but didn't get any nice results near the one with GBPUSD. It seems like your strategy belongs only there. Let's hope it will last a few years before it turns to become a loser.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yes, all the testing I have done seems to indicate that this strategy only works on GBPUSD and I'm not surprised really because when I first noticed the regular pattern it was only evident on cable!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
No trade today on FXpro GMT +3

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Geoff,

I just went to first page to check whether you have updated the EA and Report. I see no version change. However, it did indicate that you just edited about 90 minutes ago. So, need to re-download everything?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Not yet, I am having problems with my Micro***t, can't find the file in the index, I can edit it, use it, do anything I like with it but it doesn't exist!

Damned Micro***t!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Despite the problems you and many others have with Micro***t and we f*** it, the owner(s) is among the richest in the world!  Not trading forex! :

--- 帖子 #101 ---
OK, I am using Windows 7 on a laptop and can't find the file that I have edited, so I copied the non-existent file to notepad and copied that to my other laptop that runs on Vista, which is also good at losing files.

Now I have re-compiled it on my Vista laptop and, provided I can find it I will upload it as camvcvooV2 so you will know when it's done!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Attached files for V2, there was a coding error in the first release.

Please replace the old files as soon as possible.

I have also replaced the files on post #1.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
WOW!

That was really fast!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I  HATE MICROSOFT!

So take me to court!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
its your broker sometimes their old info is bad

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi,

Thank you for sharing your system.

I have tried it, however I have a trouble. The AOS has never opened a order.

At journal i have too many messages of these kind:

- 2010.05.12 16:31:522010.05.07 01:15  camvcvooV2 GBPUSD,H1: Sell OrderSend 3 failed with error #0

- 2010.05.12 16:31:522010.05.07 01:15  camvcvooV2 GBPUSD,H1: OrderSend error 4107

- 2010.05.12 16:31:522010.05.07 01:15  camvcvooV2 GBPUSD,H1: invalid price 1.48293000 for OrderSend function

Please can you to explain me, where is the problem?

PS: Sorry for my English, I hope it is understandable description of the problem

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Can you tell us what type of account you have and which broker.

This error can be caused if you try to place an order that is too small for your account type.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi Geoff,

Great concept and nice work implimenting it!!  Hats off.

I have been optimizing and am getting nice results!  Perhaps I'm missing something - is it possible to get the MM to work for .01 lots?  I have tried in backtests without success.  No matter how big I set the lots percent it seems to only trade .01 lots.

Thanks again for the great EA

GG

--- 帖子 #109 ---
The Riskpercent only works in conjunction with the VHigh Risk setting so you would need to have UseMoneyMngmt true, Vhigh_Risk true and Manual_Lot_Size false.

Or have you already tried that!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I noticed those setting and I've tried that and several other combinations but get the same results.  I'm testing with FXDD.  I tried starting with $1000 which turns into well over $1500 over a year - but the lots stay at .01 all the way along.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
This is simple.  The price has too many digits after the decimal points:1.48293

The EA code should do an appropriate NormalizeDouble() to 4 or 5 digits depending on your broker/dealer.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
It does do that!

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Can you list the % settings that you have tried!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I've tried 20, 30 and even 80.....all return .01 lots starting with $1000 deposit.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I just tried it with $1000 on Low, Med, High and Vhigh at 10% and it works alright - this graph is at 10%!

Have you got Manual_Lot_Size still set to true?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Please check my setfile:

--- 帖子 #117 ---
BTW, this file as strange as it may seem brings me great results over the past year!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Mmmm!

Can't see anything wrong there!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Ok, thanks for checking.  Must be some strange thing with my platform - just don't know.  Gotta sign off for now - it's 1am here in Thailand and I gotta get up early.  Will catch up with the thread tomorrow.  Thanks again!

GG

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I think I have found a problem in the code that would stop the Vhigh Risk setting from working correctly!

Can you use Low, Med or High for your tests?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Yes, there is a problem with the Vhigh Risk code, I fixed it and tested it at 31% risk and here is the chart, starting from $1000 going to $1,200,000 in 6 months!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Here is the modified code to enable Vhigh Risk setting to work correctly, I have also updated the files in post #1.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi Geoff,

Phew ... U rock Man

Was off for 1 day and suprised to see the new package ...

Rated the thread ....

Will also test different possibilities from my side ...

Cheers

--- 帖子 #124 ---
see u in 6 mos in las vegas then

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hey, thanks for the rating!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Ah, but would anybody dare do it!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Dude! Not a single bad trade in 6 months? I that really possible? I was always told the holy grail didn't exist... but...

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I kept the TP3 at 80 but, instead of moving the stoploss to BE I move it to +10 pips, this way it will make a small profit regardless!

Hope you agree to this!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Well, lets face it the EA is capable of making a loss, all systems, automatic or manual, must make a loss some time!

It could be tomorrow or it could be in 3 months time.

This is where the problem comes with a high risk MM run, if the loss occurs too early, it could wipe out your account!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Geof,

I do not post very often.  You now have two 5 star threads.  You have the best EA I have ever tested.  You attact very good members to you thread.  My back testing is less than yours as I use my MT4 platform strategy tester.  You have very good tick data.  You mentioned Tortola, do you live there.  I go there on business several times a year.  I will buy you the best meal and rum on the Island.  Thanks again for all your hard work.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I tried using various lot and account sizes as well as adding a 0 to the tp and sl as I am testing this on Fxpro and I cant get the ea to trade and it doesnt show and errors. I am also using the latest v2a ea. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Let me consider that.

Les Vegas is one of two of my dream destination for casinos. The other one is in Monte Carlo!

Will keep you guys posted.

Thanks very much.

Casino/gambling is going to happen in Miami, FL soon.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I am running original system from post 1 before I saw there were revisions.  I show an entry for 3 short at1.4836.

So I hope this is working correctly and we shall see and I will update, this is a live trade with micro-lots.

And my entries show to be at 2:36. Does this mean offset is wrong?  I have it set to 3 using forexmeta(fxdd)

--- 帖子 #136 ---
The original version will work ok unless you use the Vhigh Risk setting!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Beer!

I like beer!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
sorry for asking stupid questions but i am new to this thread.  Great ea you have.  The vhigh settings what does that change in the ea?

--- 帖子 #139 ---
If you use MM there are Low risk, Med risk, High risk and VHigh risk options.

With the Vhigh risk you can choose your own %.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Ok that i do understand but.  It has a fix sl in and you choose a fix order size.  So what does the vhigh setting do or is it that if you use the vhigh setting that the ea desdides youre lot size?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Exactly, when you use MM the EA determines your Lot size based on the risk level you have chosen as a percentage of your equity.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I found my metatrader crashed this morning and now with 3 shorts open. I'm a bit worried it missed to close them this night. Should I close them manually?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
in backtest the ea works great youre the designer of it.  so do you see it working great in the long run?  And in youre experience what is the best broker to use for this ea?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Same here 3 shorts @ 1.48353 opened on 01:35 GMT+2

My metatrader crashed this night and I'm worried it missed to close them. Let's see how things will go.

We need to see what London does in twenty minutes!

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Who knows long term, the best broker is the one with the lowest spread!

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Did your trades close, geoff? Just wondering if my crash made some mess.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
No they are still open and in the red!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thank god I'm using small lots for now. I might disable v5 and v7... I think they caused the crash this night acting all together.

The only survived orders were the 3 ones of the latest EA.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
And if the TP were 20 or 18 ?

or breakeven set at 18 ?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Same here 3 open @ 1:35 found my mule off few minutes ago...

Emanuelle did you manualy close them? It was my first night running the camvcvooV2a.......

--- 帖子 #152 ---
No, still open yet. I think it will come down in the next hours. I catched that drop manually and even if the EA is messing I'd loose only the previous profit.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Morning,

First don`t mind my english, it`s not one of the best, but i try as it`s not my native language.

I want to trade this system manually because i`m convinced that many brookers have some tricks to get our EA failed when we launched it in live.

I am a newbie and i have read a lot about your system, and i have some questions.

I read somewhere that the nest time to trade it manually is to trade one hour after the NY close, but when i compare with the last EA, i think it trades at the NY close and not onhe hour later. I have put it on Alpari so GMT Offset is 2,  and the start time give is 23:00

And and about your SMA 10 and 197 ?  is it simple moving average 10 and 197 ?  or slope moving average 10 and 197 . . .  Sorry if it`s a so stupid question . . .

And can i use both of them to filter my entries ??

Thank you

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Your English is fine!

The start time is some time during the 23:00 GMT candle which is the hour before Tokyo open.

We look at the slope of the 10 SMA between the previous 2 candles, 21:00 to 22:00 GMT, if this slope is the same as the 197 SMA we can consider a trade. Last night both SMA's were negative so we look for a short entry point.

The EA looks at fractals in the M15 and M5 timeframes to find an entry point.

You probably have your own manual method for deciding when to enter.

The idea is that whatever the trend is for the two hours after NY closes will be followed for the next several hours and this is 90% true, so far!

The Tokyo market often goes against us but this presents a good opportunity for manual traders to place their orders at a better price, the EA has to take more of a compromise position which is not as good.

I hope this helps!

All three trades closed in profit. Great. I doubled the pips with my manual short.

I think I might disable v5 and v7 at this point and stick with the latest EA. Switching lots from 0.06 to 0.07 for next night.

Green pips to all you guys, and thanks to Geoff. You're a superstar with your generosity.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Yess  it`ll help.

BTW, my 3rd order is still running, TP 1.4755, it might not reach that but at worst case it will make 10 pips!

Good day Sir Geoff and Everyone,

Congratulations. It's a fine morning. Kinda thoughtful for awhile but it all turned out well.

I'm having problems with my Alpari UK platform. I noticed a couple of you did too. It crashes. But also at other times, it's so sluggish that I can click on something and go for a cup of tea before a screen comes up. If I click to change from the trade tab to the Acct History tab I can have another cup of tea. And so it goes for the day. To do a backtest is not possible. I have talked to Alpari several times about it and they always say uninstall and reinstall. I do that, it's fine for 2-3 days and then starts the whole thing over again. They now say it's something I put into the platform.  Is anyone else having problems? Alpari says it's something I have put into the platform. Any suggestions from you all?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Yes micro account, does it have different feeds from yours?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Happened to me when there was that huge drop everywhere. I think the ticks were flooding metatrader and as a result it was overloaded. I was experiencing sluggish performance that day, but since then works fine.

Only this morning I found metatrader crashed, but I think it may be related to the EAs I've loaded. I had v5, v7 and the latest 3 order running. Now I disabled the first two to avoid further crashes. Let's see how things will go.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
And thank you too Sir for your advice on displaying TP's and SL's ! If it had not been for that I would have been up the creek this morning. Thank you ,thank you, thank you!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
It should be the same I have had this micro account for a few years and I know they increased capacity by adding another server about 6 months ago so you may be on the new server and I am on the old one!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I get the Alpari demo accounts going off occasionally during the day but I have never noticed the live accounts going off.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Mine happened about the same time but I only had the Three Orders running on that platform. Alpari is trying to tell me it's because I have EA's downloaded into the platform that are conflicting with it. I only have v5b, v7, reconnect, and three orders. ( We need a name for that one!). That's all. But it is sluggish to point of not moving and that's all day and evening with the exception of a short time around noon here. The Netherlands.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
can you share the test of result which is impresstive，woo！！！i want to see how you set ！！

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I didn't save the test results, it was only a quick blast with the control points setting just to check that the code was correct.

If you want to try it yourself set MM true, Vhigh true, % to 31, and Manual_lot_size to false, all the other defaults as is!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
enen....tanks geoffb65，after the test i think i will go to put it into the real account with 0.1lots，haha....

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Very brave!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hello,

It is strange, I have no trade triger tonight. But everyone else has trades.

I have checked trading candle on two brokers. And the actual candle is closed above 10 MA (see in attached sheet). So per rules EA did not triger any trades. (Broker is +3  GMT, so candle is 2:00)

How can it be, that everyone got trades tonight?

Do someone else has no trades tonight as me?

Thank you for replay.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
+22

+50

+50

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I also never got any trades since yesterday.

I set it on InterbankFX platform which is running on GMT time, and only what I have changed in settings is: GMToffset = 0

Does anyone have any idea why there are no trades?

Thanks.

Knez.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I have also a GMT+3 broker and the start was OK on candle 2

perhaps can you check  your journal about 23 GMT

--- 帖子 #182 ---
You are on the correct start candle but we do not look for the close to be above or below the SMA, we look at the slope of both SMA's between the two previous candles.

Your EA should have traded, it didn't so we need to look at your settings!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Excellent, the latest version has TP3 set to 80.

--- 帖子 #184 ---

I have tried to run backtest with last night candle inluded on two different brokers, and in  backtest EA trades past nights normaly, but did not take any trade last night, exactly like  in live trading.

Maybe there is differences on brokers data feed, but two different brokers gives same result: no trade last night.

Strange. Shuld I try to run backtest on more different brokers...

--- 帖子 #186 ---
On a lighter side, he sure has crystal balls!

I love this thread and the original thread. We are having fun!

Thanks for this system geoffb65

I have been testing in Alpari UK Live micro account. (GMToffset 2)

TP: 22

SL: 13

SL: 11

All profitable but diferente from you and stifland (check screenshot).

Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
The Manual_Lot_size looks strange, Lotsize=0.10000000

Is that $1 a pip?

If it works on backtest with your broker it should work live, was your balance large enough to cover the margin on a live account?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
OK, Thanks eoff. What are the plotted horizontal lines.?

I guess i can manually change TP's without loaded on a new version?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
The horizontal lines show yesterdays high (blue) yesterdays low (green) daily pivot (yellow) 1st bear target if low broken (magenta) 1st bull target if high broken (aqua).

I like to know this information but it is not used by the EA.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Well, equity is enaugh to cover margin.

In backtesting this trade has not been taked also, so problem is not in equity.

I have backtested last night trade on third broker fxopen, and the trade has been taked. So, i gues, there is differences on brokers datafeed.

First two brokers i have tested data feed may be a little different from third broker I have tested.

Let's see what happens next night

Thank you geoffb65, for your hard work!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
This is strange, there are many of us on Alpari but we often get different results, it's a mystery!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
You are welcome.

See my previous post, we even get different results with the same broker!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
you must choose micro OR minilot

I have had the same issue

Hi Geoff

And first of all thanks for sharing your EA with us all.

Interestingly, my results on Alpari UK demo are;

For version camvicoo -

tp1 = 22

tp2 = 50

tp3 = 50

and the same for camvicoo V2, same as above.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
First of all, RESPECT to Geoff and other participants!

However, as I was trying hard to find the info regarding downloading of those files. Please, pardon my ignorance, but mq4 goes into scripts and ex4 into experts? Thanks for a hint and again CONGRATS!

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hello everybody!

May I ask for your help? I always had problems with EAs' settings. Basically, this was the first reason why EAs never worked for me, because I never knew to put the right settings.

So, dear Geoffb65 and Camvcvoo, could you please post your own settings here, the settings that you actually use now?

Also, if I intend to trade live an account of $2000, risking maximum 4% on each trade (meaning 80 pips in all), what settings should I put on your EA?

Thank you vm!

--- 帖子 #198 ---
The default settings are exactly as I use them, you only need to change the GMT offset for your broker for it to work.

The risk you want is a bit more difficult because we have a stoploss of 140 per order, using anything less is likely to get you stopped out.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Only 122 pips! Tut tut!

My TP2 hit the TSL for some reason but TP1 & TP2 went all the way!

Hi there, please, pretty please. Could someone confirm where should I download mq4 and ex4 files? My guess is ex to experts, mq to scripts, but would like to confirm. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
geoff, on which server are you? Mine is on micro-2.alpari.co.uk

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I am on micro-2 as well, I thought it would be different!

Other people with other brokers have reported that there was no trade yesterday, have you tried a back test?

Does this mean no trade later or is it just informational?

Geoff,

5% in the last month. Alot of people would KILL to get that kind of return these days on their investments. Great Job. Now if we can find an EA for 5% a month on a few more pairs, WE'D BE RICH!! Congrats and Thank You for sharing.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
That is 5% in two days, 4 trades this month!

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi Geoff,

Just thought I'd check in with a follow-up on what I've learned about my MM problems. I get more normal results with my FXDD backtest when I add 100 to the risk percent. Anything less than 100 gives very slow lot increases with equity growth. If I use say 130, 140 etc. my results look more normal with the lots increasing with the equity. Must have something to do with 4 digits vs 5 digits messing with the code.

I was just thinking that we could likely squeeze out a few more pips on the trades if you could add a jumping stop setup similar to the one in Steve Hopwoods trade manager bot.

Cheers

GG

I have used all Simple H1 ver. you have produced so far and have been greatly impressed.  Thanks to all.  I use JadeFX now and simple 3 did not trade for me the last two nights. Have double checked everything and am on default settings.  I have back tested it many times and know it will not trade some times for days.  I am not worried yet.  We should have a short trade tonight.  On my chart now MM 0.00% with all default settings ????  JadeFX is a + 1 gmt ,but when I back test + 2 gmt give the best results ????.  Thanks again for everyones help.

When trading with a 5 digit broker do I need to add a 0 to the TP and SL or will the ea recognize the broker type?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
On back test did it trade the last two nights?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
4 and 5 digit options are built in to the EA.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thanks, looks like a good ea but I couldnt get it to backtest. Going to forward on demo and check back to see if its working.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Geoff,

I have deleted that back test.  I am basically a manual trader that for the past year trying to reduce my screen time by using good conserative EA'S as yours.  I have tested two dozen and have not found one I would put my live account on until yours.  I will retest and give you an answer.  You are the best moderator at this site.  You give replies to the new and experienced trader.  Do not lose that.  THANKS  again.

Same here... I have 2 demo accounts (2 different brokers), one went in short, the other didn't. Same general settings on both of them. I still try to figure out why it didn't work the same way in both cases. The only difference is one has 4 digits, the other 5. And also the lot size is different, the one working was set to1, the one not working was set to 0.1. Maybe somewhere here is the problem...

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hey goldenequity

I am very sorry, I forgot mention your name.

You guys are really helpful

Thanks

--- 帖子 #251 ---

I didn't know junior members were not allowed to vote! lol!

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Geoff,

Please comment on what i have observed:

Those newbies who wish to use money management from the EA, please note that if you set MM to True and you selected Low Risk of 1 %, it does not mean 1%, it means 3%!

Here's why:

This is a 3 order EA. If you select 1%, the EA will open three units each with 1% risk, totaling 3%.

So, Jorg, from what you picture tells me you are on MM of 10% which is effectively 30%! It does not matter if it is a demo or real account. As long as you know what you are doing, then, you are fine.

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
That is correct it is 1% per order.

If you hit the stoploss you will lose 1% of your equity per order!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Same here, no trade.

--- 帖子 #259 ---

Ahm, I learned that Friday is a bad day for trading. I'll maybe just do some scalping and nothing more.

I used this ea for 2 days and its open trades with no loss! Yesterday i used v7, its open 2 trades. today, 3 trades using camvcvoov2 and all closed with profit.

Of course nice system as we can notice . . .

--- 帖子 #282 ---
OK, now we know that the EA works with you broker but the results don't look quite right, I need to check the GMT offset for your broker!

Which broker is it and what did you set the GMT offset to?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Nice!

But it's not the same without bottom twitching!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
It is InterbankFX and I set GMT offset to be 0

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Yes, that is correct, so I'm not sure why the result is so poor, on control points I would not have had any losses in that period on my back testing with Alpari.

Would you like to try a back test using every tick?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I will try to reload this EA, and please tell me, do I have to change anything else apart from GMT offset?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
No, all the defaults are optimised to give the best result, only the GMT offset needs to be adjusted!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Done that, and just made lot size 0.01 instead of 0.1

Does this EA takes trades any time of the day, or only at the beginning of the Asia session or ....?

--- 帖子 #290 ---

Thanks for the answer. For 2 days, my account increase 7%, great!

Gud luck every one!

I was thinking about strategy tester. Before last Sunday of March Alpari UK is GMT+1.

Does anyone consider this?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I am not convinced that this is the case, and yes it has been thoroughly thrashed out on the other thread.

I believe Alpari UK is GMT +2 all year round!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Am pretty sure the buggers go back 1 hr (making it GMT +1) on the last Sunday in October and forward 1hr (making it GMT +2 as it is currently) on the last Sunday in March

--- 帖子 #298 ---
+22

+22

+80

Sweet!  Not sure why tp didn't move for T3,  but worked out awesome  Thanks geoff>Beers in a few months.

Hi

The GMT offset for Alpari UK in the Summer is GMT+2 (or BST+1).

The GMT offset for Alpari UK in the Winter is GMT+1.

Our trading servers always run on Central European Time (CET).

CET has summer and winter time, which usually changes on the last Sunday of March and on the last Sunday of October respectively.

Thanks

Customer Services

--- 帖子 #300 ---
so the GMT Offset will have to be changed to +1 with Alpari UK when that happens since they'll be changing dst?  What's important is the changing of times the markets will then open.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
In winter there is Daylight Saving Time, whatever that is, and Alpari don't comply with this which ensures that they are +2 all year.

Whatever, we will find out in October!

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Well done!

Hi Geoff,

I have not had any trades yet. I back tested from May 1 to May 14 2010. 14 wins no losses.  Super 961.00 profit.  My broker is JadeFX and should be +1 gmt, but +2 gmt gives the best results in back testing.  Last night I had average daily range exceeded so I expected no trade.

Great work please keep it up.  If I can be of any help please ask.

THANKS EVERYONE ON THIS TREAD.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Geoff,

I think there are bugs. I am not a coder so most likely i am wrong.

Anyway, looking at market today, the third unit should be closed at breakeven instead of +80pips. I am not saying it is not good but if working as intended, i think that's how the trade should work out.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
That is great news!

The daily range is just for information, it is not used by the EA.

If the EA works with your broker on demo, it will work on a live account but it does not trade every day!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
There are no bugs in the code, cheeky!

It depends on the entry point, remember we have seen a large range of values when the trade is placed depending on the broker.

TP3 does not go to BE if it fails, it goes to +10 in the latest version.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Sorry, my fault!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
But does itrailing stop 2 = 50 mean it will kick in at 50? if so i think it is right it would have been stopped instead of +80 as it bounced all the way back yo to633 before dropping to +80.

On another question. If i want ea to pick lot size I set MM risk i want and put manual to false? When i do that it says order lots = 0. Although his may be due to being flat?

Anyway great first week. thanks geoff.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
The trailing stop is only used on TP2, there is no trailing stop on TP1 or TP3.

TP1 is 22 and the trailing stop should also be 22, if you have changed any of the settings from default you will get different results to me!

If you want to use MM set Money Management to true and Manual Lot Size to false, then select Low, Med or High risk to true.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
OK so tp3 3 will get +80 or full stop.

Itrail2 means that is second level trail will jump up? anyway, doesn't matter

246 pips in 2 days.

just trying to understand logic

--- 帖子 #311 ---
TP3 will get +80 or it will fall back to +10, not 0.

Trailing stoploss stays 22 pips below TP2 so if the second order moves up the stop will follow it locking in profit, if it then falls back the trailing stoploss will catch the locked in profit.

I would say that 246 pips in 2 days is pretty fantastic!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi Geoff,

Thanks for your patience for all our questions. If I may suggest something, why don't you write a detailed manual of your system, this would avoid answering 10 times the same questions. It would save you a lot of time for your personal trading!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I'm using camvcvoo2a but i have not your backtest, and i havn't your results; i'm trying in activetrades and fxopen account. I'm pretty sure for the broker's hour, but i don't understand if it not works on 4 dgt's brokers.

Can u show me version and set that u're using for get that results in backtest and live? ty

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thank you for your concern!

Actually I don't do any personal trading, at least not manual trading.

I discovered many years ago that I am useless at manual trading, that is why all my trading uses EA's that I have developed myself.

Looking after the two threads gives me something to do while I monitor my server which currently has 37 live MT4 platforms running, without the threads I would probably spend my time munching chocolate, drinking beer and eating cake!

Also, if I write a manual would people read it, they don't even read post #1 before diving in with questions! lol!

--- 帖子 #315 ---
The default values in camvcvoo2a are optimised and are the only settings that I use.

In post#1 there is a .zip file, if you download this and open it you will find a full 12 month back test report.

The EA works with 4 or 5 digit brokers.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi Geoff

'munching chocolate, drinking beer and eating cake!'...That doesn't sound all that good at all mate! http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif ...but I guess that someone has to do it!! lol

Cheers mate!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Need I say more?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Exactly!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Geoff,

Just to be sure about this.

When you said 31%, do you mean putting 31 in the Vhigh risk input field? That is effectively 93% risk with three orders.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Yes, but I'm not recommending that anyone should do that, I was only testing the percentage setting to make sure it was working!

Besides, the graph that I did was using control points and showed no losses, I think on every tick it would be a different story!

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Both of my Alpari Uk demo accounts went short last night  01:25 local time (GMT +2)  S on 1.46008 both in profit....

Thanks again G

How much RAM (or whatever) do I need to run Ver 7 -3orders?  I couldn't get it to load.  How many computers/screens do you all use?  (If this is off topic, please let me know and I'll delete it.)

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I don't really know what the answer to this is, RAM is dynamically allocated so, if you can use a browser on the internet you should have no memory problems running several EA's on one computer.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Thanks, Geoff.  Will have to look for another reason why my Ver 7 3orders wouldn't load.  Ver 7 worked fine, though.  IBFX live +22 and +24.

Hi all.  My first thread on this great forum.

I've been back testing this EA today and really impressed with the result.  Will test in on Demo next week then hopefully live after.

One question, does this EA handle requotes?  I've been having a lot requotes with my manual trading lately so just wondering what happens if the EA tries to open a trade and gets a requote?

I'm with Alpari UK, by the way.

Thank a lot.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
just remembered the 2 order version works with ecn/stp because of the hide tp/sl option (not because of its internal implementation) , without it as an option can this 3 order version works with ecn?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Each order is sent up to 10 times if a requote is requested!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
The 3 order version works in the same way as the 2 order version, the open orders are closed by the EA!

My April back test on Fxpro: 24 trades, one loss on the 2nd of april (went long on a swing high)

Strange...

I'll try on a Alpari UK account to compare...

Edit: same chart Alpari+2/Fxpro+3... What's your gmt offset?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi all,

I still confused about GMT setting, I used broker FxOpen and live in Malaysia. Should I change the GMT setting to 8 or just use default?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
If this was a demo account tested today the spread will be 8, during the week it is less than 2.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
What is the best setting?!

Default? :-?

Thanks for your Nice EA!

there is a problem! the SL is very high! and one lose will cut a lot of profit!

Any way! thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi guys! I've been trading the original trading method for some time now, it is extremely profitable, but I have some issues with EA's...

I am aware of the effect that profitable EA's have on retail brokers and the problems that automatic generated orders face with a dealing desk system.

Can someone post some entry examples based on the rules that the EA's use???

The original thread is now huge, and that is completely understandable, a whole profitable system was developed there, I of course plan to read it completely in order to understand how when and why, but that will only be possible on my vacations (next week!!!).

Now I have some ideas I want to test during the weekend and it I would be very grateful if someone could post those original manual rules with some screenshots.

Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi Geoff,

I have the same problem as Couton in the Simple H1 tread.  No trades due to Error # 0.  The EA camvcvoo V2a, tried about 10 times to place the sell order, but the brokers server would not except. I use JadeFX.  I guess ??  On my chart the MM 0.00% with all default settings  All other simple H1 vers. have traded for me and I have other EA's trading also. On those charts MM 10.00%.   I find this the best EA I have ever used.  Back testing works great.  Also on the screen MM 0.00% also is indicated.  I will now up grade the MT 4 226 ver. and reinstall everything and be ready for next week.  Any other sugestions.  Thanks for you help.  I hope I did not spoil your diet.

joet

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi joet!

This is a very strange problem, especially as you are already using the other version, this EA uses exactly the same code to place the orders!

Couton has solved one problem by getting married!

I suppose there is no chance, seeing that you will be placing several orders at once, that your account can't meet the margin requirements?

I'm clutching at straws I'm afraid!

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi Orcinus!

Earlier today I added a few notes in post #1 on the other thread about manually trading this strategy however, I must re-state my own position, I am no expert at manual trading so, true to form, I have passed the buck (no pun intended) and asked people to look out for posts from members such as calstock who have found success manually trading the strategy.

I hope you find what you are looking for!

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi Geoff,

I do not think my present wife would approve of another woman for me.   Maybe a little extra pay and benefits would not hurt.  Do you show the MM on your screen as MM 0.00%.  I have not had that before.  I will reinstall everything and try on another broker too.  I normally download the file with thw mq4 extention.  I will try the one with ex4 this time.  Who knows.  Thanks have a great weekend.  Hope the weather in the UK is great for you.

joet

--- 帖子 #346 ---
If you are using Manual_Lot_Size true and Money_Management false the MM % has no effect on the operation of the EA.

If you are using MM then you must also select Low, Med, High or Vhigh Risk, with Vhigh Risk you type in the risk % that you want to use.

BTW. If you are just wanting to use the EA you should only download the .ex4 file and put it in your experts folder.

The .mq4 is the source code to give people who understand coding the methods used to generate the trades.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi Geoff

I had very good results with this superb EA last week

Friday it enters the trade after 8 retry ( very well design option)

perhaps it would be a good idea to place the same retry order for close orders

what do you think?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hi gir!

Close orders are no problem because they are picked up on every cycle of the program so they can't escape!

Also, the SL & TP information is sent to the broker when we place the order.

Belt and braces, as they say!

Yes, this is a problem I have noticed myself, it is on the third order which doesn't actually have a trailing stop but the stop does trail the price and eventually protects it from going below +10 where it closes it.

I need to check the code in this area and see if I can come up with a better way!

--- 帖子 #351 ---
on my backtest, im getting no orders and messages like this  in my journal

2010.05.16 19:18:50 2010.01.21 03:06  camvcvooV2a GBPUSD,H1: OrderModify error 130

what do i need to do?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi Geoff,

Is it possible to do a normal trailing stop for order 3 as with the other 2?

On my backtest I had about 8000 modified orders for just one transaction where the trailing stop constantly moved back and forwards.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
ok ive reinstalled the ea and now it is making orders, but seems like the account balance is going nowhere but south... im testing this using gomarkets... i put gmt +2 using default settings... dont know what im doing wrong here..

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Take a look at the spread, I'm betting it's on the weekend setting!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
The only reason we added the third order was to reduce the number of times the trailing stoploss gets hit on the second order, it would kind of defeat the object if I put a TSL on it now!

Besides, I have found out how to stop it doing multiple modifies and will be releasing the new version as soon as I finish testing!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Does this trade the sunday evening opening?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Yes it should trade tonight, unless the 10 SMA moves upward in which case it would conflict with the 197 SMA and there would be no trade.

Fingers crossed!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
If people are interested in weekend testing then have a look at this application. It allows you to modify the spread in MT4 Strategy Tester.

I know the weekend is nearly over, was a bit slow with my post.

Hi Geoff,

I have a few problems, If you can help.  I reloaded my MT4 build 226 with my primary broker Jadefx 5 digit.  Works great in back testing now.  Hope the order send error # 0 is gone .

I also use TDFX broker 4 digits.  I have set up camcvoo V2a.  In back testing I get in the journal invalid price 1.59185000 order send function, order send error 4107, sell order send 3 failded with error # 0.  The orders will go through when the fifth digit is 0.  TP and SL also work good once in the trade.  I think if you could code a 4 digit entry price ver. it would work good.

Thanks for all your effort helping us all out.  I wish I could help with coding, but I can bearly operate this computer.  Will help if I can. I am a good manual trader.  Would like a good EA or two. Yours are the best.

joet

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi Joet

It is a 4 digit or 5 digit EA, 4107 is the error code for invalid price, have you got mini account and micro account set to true?

You didn't say what type of account you have.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi Geoff,

As a manual trader I never paid attention to 4 or 5 digits.  Now the EA does. I have both mini and micro set to true.  I have a mini demo account at TDFX.  I dosen't seem to like all those digits.  As I said some trades will go through if fifth digit in zero.  If it only had  4 digits I think it may work good.  If not I will open another 5 digit broker for a demo account.

Thanks again.

joet

--- 帖子 #363 ---
The EA works with 4 or 5 digits!

The problem is, "Invalid Price"!

If your account is a mini account then you should set MicroOrdersAllowed to false!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hi Geoff,

Thanks for taking your Sunday and working with the traders on your tread.  Since you are about 9 months older than I am I look up to you for advice.

I put microaccount false and still have the same problem in the strategy tester.  I wish I was more independent at this, but you help is needed.

Thanks

Member Boxxie uses TDFX, maybe he can help!

I use TDFX (Tadawulfx) and have not  missed a trade. They are a STP broker. Just note that on their FAQ it  says that their server offset is +1 when in fact it is +2. (My guess is  that it will change back to +1 in the winter.)                Last edited by Boxxie, May 15, 2010 2:02pm (30 hr ago)  Reason: spelling error

Just a thought.  how about  a trailing stop on the low of the last three  candles on a long order. It tends to catch most of a short term move.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Geoff,

Ok to trade live with v2a?

Am starting live with v2a today.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Yes, there will be a lot of modify data in the journal while TP3 is still trading but this does not cause a problem with the TP & SL.

I have modified the code to stop this but I am still testing it!

If that's the case.........all three orders will go into FULL TP!

If you want to run two EA's....put them on different GBPUSD 1 hour charts and change the magic number...

My  settings for this EA version 2a..

1st TP 30

2ndTP 50

3rd TP 80

SL 140     ( I think thats default )

remember to put in your broker time I think by default Geoff has set it for Alpari....so it will be GMT 2 and start time 23.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
The risk, refers to the amount of your account you wish to risk in a drawdown...so if the position goes against you by 10 % it will close the position..

I just enter 10 for 10%, you will see the risk amount on the screen if you have " show settings" on true..

If you have your expert advisers enabled they both should work ok, If you want to disable one but leave it on a chart other then the one you wish to use just go to properties and common tab...and disable live trading..

That should stop that EA from working..

I have just asked Geoff to come in and help you with your broker settings as Iam not sure what IBFX,  should be....

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Okay, I went into Vers 5 Properties and unchecked "Allow live trading." That seemed to work to just enable your version to trade. Frowning face on Vers 5 and smiley face on yours...

I'm clear on the broker settings--I mistook BROKER SETTINGS as something I should change when it was really just a title to the choices below it.  My only thing now is do I leave both MicroOrders allowed and MiniOrders allowed set as true (default)?  I have a Standard account (but should have signed up for a Mini account--am fixing that with IBFX.)  If it doesn't bother anything right now, I'll just leave it as default (true).  I'm deleting the above questions (answered by you) now.  And thanks for saving me!!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Calstock, I left the settings at default (22/50/80). I'm now at profits 1 and 2 $41 and $41. TP 1 didn't close. Do you think I should close TP1 manually or leave it alone?  If I close TP1, will that interfere with TP2 and TP3?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Yes..15min chart is showing a retraction.. you can always re-enter if she breaks the low again.

your trailing stop should have taken TP 1 and 2....it did on mine....whats your set at.?

Mine is set at 22

Hi Mary

One thing I should have mentioned before, once a trade is in progress do not try to adjust the settings, the EA will lose control of the existing trades!

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hi geo ! All works now very good - but we have  - it seems to me - mainly 2 probs - crashing some times and very different behaviour of brokers concerning trade opening ?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I'm sure the EA does not crash, it is not written by Microsoft!

Brokers data feeds are a problem and I am looking at alternative ways to trigger the trade instead of fractals.

Come on guys, I've only got one pair of hands!

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hello, I'd like test your EA on real account. But I have a problem with possitions open. My broker has some time between another open. I think it about 3-5 sec between next trade. When trade is open I have only one possitions. Where can I add the delay in the code to open all trades.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #402 ---
no no, I know that you have 10 pair of hands, 5 brains and all Microsoft versions back till 1952

There was a problem with the third order filling up the journal with modify order entries, this new version fixes that problem!

If you just want to run the EA, upload the .ex4 file to your computer and paste it into your experts folder then re-start MT4:
camvcvooV3.ex4

12 month strategy report canvcvooV3.zip is attached.

The files are also updated in post #1.

Geoff,

Since I removed the reconnect EA I have had no problems with Alpari UK crashing or stalling in any way.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
You will need to add a delay between each order:

1st order}//end while

Sleep(3000); // add this between each order

retries =10;

while(retries > 0)
second order.........

An alternative, which is probably easier, is to increase the existing Sleep() value in the Retry loop! Why didn't I spot that before!

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Great!

My Alpari demo accounts usually disconnect 2 or 3 times a day but I have never noticed the live accounts do this!

All 3 trades in TP on Alpari UK live.

Hello,

my experience with EA's are, that they are working better with the feed of demo accounts regarding order execution. Therefore I'm using a demo account as ''signal giver''. A master-slave-system hands over the trades to what account ever (IBFX, FXPro, etc). I'm on the track with an Alpari RU-demo account, because of the very solid feed. Earlier I was using Apari UK but the demo feed has a lot of interruptions per day and is unusable.

If somebody need help to set up a master-slave-system, send a pm!

Geoff, thanks a lot for the great observation, great idea, work and help.

All the best, Steve

Great EA

Hope this continues with success.

That is a great idea, the Alpari demo accounts are based on their Pro accounts which use ECN data feed but, as you rightly say, Alpari UK demo accounts are for ever breaking down!

silv3r4sh: My bad - you're right - it's Go Markets. I've only been with them about a month but no complaints. My main criteria for being with a broker is good customer support, low spreads, and of course NO DESK DEALING!

Right now I'm looking into Forex.Com, their platform is on GMT and they offer free VPS. Think Geoff (or someone) mentioned them earlier. Not recommending anything here, just mentioning my process. When I transfered my funds from MIG to Go Markets my bank screwed up and didn't transfer the account in USD, but AUD. Not a major problem, but after trading forex in USD for 8 years I'm kinda set in my ways there.

P.S.  Last I heard Alpari UK wouldn't open an real account if you were in the U.S.  They'd refer you to Alpari US instead.

Hello Geoff,

I'm testing your fantastic EA on my broker: Tadawulf (4 digit).

Note that the Minimum Lotsize I can trade is 0.05 on a Microlot Account with a Leverage of 500:1.

I have download the last version in post #408.

But I have problems:

2010.05.17 10:32:042010.01.22 01:45  camvcvooV3 GBPUSD,H1: Buy OrderSend 3 failed with error #0

2010.05.17 10:32:042010.01.22 01:45  camvcvooV3 GBPUSD,H1: invalid lots amount for OrderSend function

I have tried in various ways but I still have the problem.

I have deselect MM, I have used fixed lot size of 0.1, but same problem.

Can you help me?

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #421 ---
There is something strange with TDFX, someone else is having the same problem earlier in the thread.

Error 4051 is "Invalid function parameter value" and it would appear that the value that is being rejected is "Lots".

What does 0.1 lot size mean to TDFX, I would see that as $1 a pip but is this what they see it as?

Geoff

EDIT:

I have enquired on the other thread, there are people using TDFX there!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hi Geoff,

I have completely reinstalled my MT4 platform with Jadefx and it back tests perfectly. camvcvoo V3.  Hope for good trades tonight.

I also use TDFX in Demo account 4 digit broker.  I have watched on visual back testing and EA tries to place trades at the right time, but it sends a buy with 8 digits and their server with not except trade with that many digits for trade or lots. On my Jadefx account EA send a 5 digit trade number. Sorry I can not change code for you.  Is there any way you can make a true 4 digit EA so I can use TDFX.  If not I will try another 5 digit broker.  I have turned off and on everything to make it work.  No Luck.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #423 ---
First time trying this EA on IBFX last night. Three positions opened at 01.25 hours at 1.4433, 1.4433 and 1.4432

The first order closed at 21 pips profit

The second order closed 9 minutes later at 10 pips profit

The third order closed 19 minutes after that at 11 pips profit

The low was 1.4250. The second & third orders got taken out by the stop loss apparently just by a nose hair. With a lower spread than 4, would have gone on to a 100 pip plus profit.

Will be looking to try this live soon.

Very impressive EA.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi joet

The EA doesn't specify the price, it takes the Ask or Bid price quoted by the broker and that is the value sent with the order.

So, one would expect a 4 digit broker to quote a 4 digit price, the EA does nothing to the quoted price!

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Thanks, Geoff.  Another thing:  On the mini/micro account issue, I'm trading .1 lots and have a Standard account with IBFX ($1,000).  They said I should have opened a Mini account, but it's okay if I leave it as Standard.  So, do I leave MiniAccount and MicroAccount setting as true?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
If you are using ManualLotSize true and 0.1 lot size you can leave both options set to true.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi Geoff,

I have included my TDFX journal. Maybe you can tell what is wrong. I usually can figure out how to make things work Even with my limited knowledge of the EA's. I am stumped this time.

Thanks for your help. Can you recommend an good 5 digit broker that I can use.

joet  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Well, those are definitely 5 digit prices alright, I have not seen that before with any other broker!

If they are a 4 digit broker they should quote prices with 4 digits, wierd!

The EA is working on other 4 digit brokers with no problem.

forex.com are quite good!

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi Geoff,

Thanks for taking your time to help me.  I will go to forex.com and see if they will except a yank for an account.

My primary account is very good at Jadefx.  Low spreads and good executions.

I think your EA's is the best I have ever tested.  All ver.  V3 is another great ver.  I hope they now work for me.

Hi mary4x

If You trade 0,1 lot on a $1000 Standard account You risk $420 (42%) every day. I think thats to risky. I risk 10% every day, for $1000 lotsize:

10% of $1000=$100, $100/420 = $0,24/pip. With a standardaccount its Lotsize 0,02, with mini 0,24.

With $1000 I think its better with miniaccount for better mm.

Best wishes

Elovv

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Thanks for this. I'm terrible at MM. I'll adjust my lot size as you suggest.  Do I leave MiniAccount and MicroAccount defaults as true?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thus far, the EA has been working great and it's too new to be able to judge what it will do live. I think risking 10% on any one trade might be on the high side, at least starting out. If you have a $1,000.00 account and don't really mind losing a hundred bucks, that's cool. But, when that account gets up to ten thousand, and you're risking a thousand of that on one trade, it would create some sleepless nights and fingernail biting for all but poker players with steel nerves. But, of course, to each his own.

Maybe risking 3-5% to start with would be better on the nerves, and after the account is up by more than 10%, increase the percentage. That way, you would be playing with the houses money. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Does a Standard account allow trades less than 0.1 lots?

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I dont know. I have account with Oanda, they have exactly the lotsize You will have and IBFX mini, they have 0,01 lots = 1 cent/pip

Geoff-

Good thread.  I see you mentioned V7 several times in this thread, but on the 1st page I only see downloads for camvcvooV3, is nobody using V7 anymore?  If you are still using V7, are you still providing download for that or is that obsolete and camvcvooV3 is better?

No trades this night on Alpari.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Geoff could You please tell me if this is a normal behavior or not:

when I backtest this ea, trades are taken ok olso there are MA's and those lines showing daily range but

when I put this ea on chart to forward test it - there are only comments on the left and no MA's, and no range lines.

Is this normal or have I some problem with MT4 or broker?

THX

--- 帖子 #457 ---
That is normal, moving averages are not shown but the values are still used by the EA, you can add them yourself, I usually do that!

The daily high, low and pivot are calculated at 1:00 (broker time) so they will appear after that time!

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I'm not sorry, it would be a difficult one to call!

Hi Geoff

Not sure if this has already been mentioned in this thread or not, if it is not too much trouble, how many days has this EA been forward tested and how many winning / losing trades has it achieved thus far.

I started forward testing on the 13/5  and so far have had 2 wining trades and no losing trades.

If anyone else has live results.....can you post them please, if Geoff doesn't mind of course.

cheers to all.

Hello Geoff.Thanks for this GREAT EA.Now,if I run this EA on a Standard Account,do I set the Micro and the Mini to False or leave them set on True?I will set the Manual Lot Size to True.Also,my broker is FXCM UK they are GMT +1,so for Tokyo I have the EA set at Offset +1 and Start Time at 23,now if I want to use this EA for London,which opens at 8 GMT,do I use this setting Offset +1 and Start Time 7?Thank you......GOD BLESS

--- 帖子 #470 ---
On a standard account you can set Mini & Micro to false.

If FXCM are +1 then set the GMT offset to 1, thereafter use GMT times.

So 1 hour before Tokyo is 23:00 GMT and 1 hour before London is 7:00 GMT.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
No one mentioned that their EA took a trade. On IBFX, the EA initiated two short trades at the identical time. I haven't changed any settings except the amount of lots.

Both the live and demo trades were winners for 22 pips, 2 pips and 11 pips.

--- 帖子 #472 ---

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hey geoffb65

Is the Stoploss 140 is the total for all three position??

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I can't imagine why, either. I remember seeing that the EA header said the volume was too low on both the demo and live accounts. Also, I notice I forgot to change the GMT offset from 2 to 0 on the live account, and yet both EAs made the short trades at 01:35.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Must be because GMT offset whas 2. This strategi takes trades gmt23-00, Your trade whas 2 hour later.

Elovv

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Mary, one other thing to consider is that there is a potential loss of 420 pips, versus a maximum win of 152. That ratio is roughly 3 to 1, meaning that it would take you at least 3 wins to make up for 1 loss.

If there was a bad streak, it would take you a minimum of roughly TEN wins to make up for 3 losses. The back testing of this EA shows it has very few losses.

For various reasons, live trades and demo trades on the same EA do not mirror each other, with the performance of live trades being worse than demo trades. Brokers don't worry about people making demo money. When it comes to real money, things happen that don't happen on a demo account.

That being said, this system and EA is the best I've seen. But, I will be reducing my % wagered on my live account to a mere 1% until I am sure it's working properly, as my EA took a trade that no one else reports.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Elov, on the demo account EA, I had the offset set to 0, and the live one, it was set to 2, and both the demo and live accounts made the trade at exactly 01:35.

Since that time is more than 2 hours past 23:00, from what you're saying is that it didn't matter what my setting was as both EAs would have been activated at that time?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Very strange. Starttime 23, one ea gmt offset 0, the other one gmt offset 2 and both take trades 01.35

Your liveaccount made a correct trade, with gmt 2 its supposed to trade 01-02 and SMA10 whas down 23-24.

But I cant understand why You demo took a trade.

There shouldn't be such a range of users that don't get entries and others that do even with the ticks or spreads being a little off because the timeframe is huge.  I've only seen it sometimes when when you are dealing with second or minute timeframes in MT4.  These kind of issues in demo can arise though because it depends on your backtest data, although again more than likely since the timeframe on this is so high, it shouldn't matter even when MT4 interpolates the backtest.

I'll take a look at the code in detail tonight and see what the issue may be.  I don't know the rules of the strategy yet, but if even though a large timeframe is used and a decision on a trade can make or break the trade by just being a a tiny bit off affecting variables, then there may need to be an adjustment.  With many trades and lower timeframes, I personally think it's fine to miss trades and others to not miss trades and vice versa because it will even out.  When you are dealing with high timeframes and # of trades are low, then when you miss a trade, or you hit a losing trade when others didn't, then it becomes a much bigger problem.

Also, if there truly are issues between for 4 digit brokers, then you would see the error messages in the journal.  Please let the thread know what the messages are then.

Hi joet,

I think IBFX should be gmt 0, this time of the year.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Just one thing to bear in mind, one of the fractals to initiate the trade is taken from the M5 time frame.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hi Geoff,

Just to let you know, I have run various permutations and combination of indicators to replace the fractals. Nothing worked as good as the M15 fractal filter. It is the key to this EA, of course M5 enhances it with timing.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I have been doing the same thing for a few days now and I have not found anything even half as good as the fractals!

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Ok, that could very well be the reason since fractals can appear/disappear with just one tick difference.

Geoff- 2 things...sounds like this is incorporating two things I love about strategies and that I even do myself, which makes me eager to be more involved in this one.  1.  It uses multiple timeframes, using a smaller one for entries...I do that almost all the time. 2.  It uses fractals....I love fractals and I think many traders underestimate its value for identifying swings.

Your strategy almost seems to have a martingale approach.  These guys seem to have it down well: http://www.fxpromaker.com/, although I ran this strategy under demo with $10,000 and it blew the account.  You are very right in that timing is everything with these kind of systems.

If users still have discrepancy in trades, what I've done in the past is output to a text file all the variables including a few bars before of the timeframe it is on and bars of what the entry strategy (like the 5min fractal) uses as a comparison for other users to see if yes indeed the other users also had fractals or not, if that few ticks did make that difference (most likely), etc.  This way you can identify exactly why some users had a winner/loser trader when another user didn't and can adjust accordingly if needed.

I've been trading with another trader I used to trade with in Chicago, and when we are auto trading live 24/7 using 5 second custom timeframe, we have trades that don't match all the time even though we use the same MB Trading broker.  The reason is because my computer is faster than his and my mt4 processes more ticks than his at times when the market gets busy.  Sometimes I have more winners, but sometimes I have more losers as well.  Don't think faster is always just better   MT4 is setup in a way that it cannot process more than 1 tick at a time while it's going through the algorithm.  That's why you may get old tick data occasionally because your computer may be too slow and by the next time it gets a tick, it's already way off.  This should explain reasons why so many users can have different trades.  People always blame the brokers, but it's not always their fault.....MT4 platform has a lot of limitations (but an advantage is that it is very easy to code).

--- 帖子 #488 ---
It is not Martingale but the money management can be used to get exponential growth if people want to build their account rapidly.

I'm more slow and steady myself!

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi Geoff, jdtrader,

Thanks for any help.  I posted my TDFX 4 digit broker journal in post # 433.  There was another post with a similar problem in post # 425.

I can stay with a 5 digit broker if needed.  I have been with TDFX for a while and like them along with my primary broker Jadefx 5 digit broker.  I did have a problem with Jadefx with V2a , sendorder failed due to error #0.  I do not know what that means.

Thanks

Hello everyone.

I have backtested v3 and noticed when you put the gmt offset to 1 and the start time to 23 the there will be more false trades.

I tried this because alpari is gmt +1.

But when you turn in back to 2 its all ok.

Am I missing something? its quite confusing.

Or when I change the offset do I have to change the start time?

Best wishes,

Danel.

YO Geoff,

Just out of the curiosity on the entry.  Once we have 10 and 197 in same direction at appropriate hours, tell me a bit about the fractal entry.

EA looks for a 3 or 5 bar fractal to form on 15, then a subsequent fractal on the 5 and enter on that close?

Don't want to be the party pooper, but I have seen in time that nice functioning threads go down the drain when the crowd gets the smell of it.

Lots of dumb and lazy folks will show up with questions that are easily answered if they would just have taken the time to learn the babypips school classes.

Let's hope we keep a hard working focused team here.

Congrats to Geoff and thanks to Sanyhuis for inviting me.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Missed today's trade (had to go to work http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon8.gif ) but live results continue to be very good.

Will consider using it on real account in a few more weeks.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
In total agreement with you there, Freddy.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi Freddy. Nice to see you here. I have been away fromn the boards for some time until recently. I agree with you on threads, but this one has no indicators to add. I'm sure some will try to refine the stops, or optimize the EA, or this and that. But, Geoff doesn't seem to mind helping people here that are new and have questions. I don't think he's even opposed to someone that might offer suggestions for improvement to what already appears to be a great EA.

TadawulFX Demo, trades took at 23:20 lasted about 36 minutes to all closed with profit.

Broker is set at GMT +2 at this time of year; their site says GMT+1 but someone here already pointed out due to daylight savings it's off. I used the P4L Clock indi and it showed broker time being gmt +2 as well.

Anyone using a FXCM MT4 account?

Can you please confirm the offset is GMT +1

Thanks

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Jogariga maybe FXCM is GMT -4? I saw this on Geoff's other thread, 1st post:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650

Update: From FXCM's site FAQ: http://forexforums.dailyfx.com/faqs-...rader-4-a.html

What is the GMT offset for FXCM?

There are currently two different technology providers for MT4.

If the icon on your desktop says FXCM Trader 4, your GMT offset is -4

If the icon on your desktop says FXCM MT4 powered by BT, your GMT offset is +1

i didnt get any trades on my gomarkets account at all... sorry im noob, is the gmt offset 2 for this broker?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
According to their FAQ, yes it is GMT +2

With Alpari Uk (demo) I had a short trade today. Are you using a demo or live account Mr Bosch?

And for those who still have "gmt issues", just go to http://www.forexmarkethours.com/. You can download a small app that converts timezones.

Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
hmm i dunno why i didnt get any trades triggered then....weird..  :s everything is default....

--- 帖子 #523 ---
3 shorts on Alpari this night. 1 TP, 2 SL, all positive. Great.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Ok...I said I would take a peak at the code tonight and here is what I've found without spending too much time looking at more details....

This is more on the technical side, not strategy side yet.

There have been a few posts from users saying that they get error #0.  Most recent was from joet post 496.  In the code after all the ordersend functions, GetLastError() is called checking to see if it is zero and if no, then display the error code.  This is incorrect and extremely deceiving because it will give the user an error code of 0 (no error) every time there is an error in any part of this strategy.  GetLastError() consumes the error trap.  What you need to do is store the result of ordersend and if the result gives an error, then retrieve the error using GetLastError(), not consume it.  Furthermore, it's also good practice to then call the error description built in function by mt4 to display to the user what the error code is.  I fixed this in all the spots and if you don't consume the error message but actually show what it was, it's code 130, which is stoploss error.

The reason why most users (not all) are not having issues with this is because those users who are not having issues are using NON ECN brokers.  ECN brokers do not deal against you, they don't manipulate the price, which is why I and others that use ECN brokers will see pip spreads from 0 - 1 pip.  But ECN brokers do not allow EAs to submit stoplosses as one order.  You have to split the orders out.  I fixed it on my version, but don't want to post the new code...this is your thread and your strategy which is wonderful, but the logic will need to be corrected for it to work properly/correctly.

Also, for all the ordersends which is for any broker and everybody, I would recommend not using retries in the code using a counter if any error occurs.  What if you get error code 137 broker is busy error and then after several loops, they get freed up and you potentially have several unattended orders in place while being asleep....I'm not saying this is likely, I'm just saying you typically handle these type of scenarios not with a counter but resending it only when the context is busy and when it's free then it will take the order.  Then you are putting much less risk in potentially one day waking up and seeing filled orders you didn't want.  You check for error code 146 context is busy only.

And one final comment, this EA could easily get a huge performance boost (not strategy just how fast it runs).  All those times pre built server functions like OrderOpenprice(), Orderstotal(), ordertype(), etc make a call to the server take time and since it's being called a ton of times in the code all over and several different server functions, it can just be put in a local variable in the and reused.  I also think RefreshRates() is a big waste and expensive performance boost especially when called so much, but there are others that will argue this is necessary, but in this case if the code is tweaked more, taking it out will make it run faster and hence handle more ticks and run through the algorithms more, but that's my opinion.  I don't use it in any of my EAs, but as long as the EA is optimized.  Oh and for the Poin variable, you can just use Point / 0.1, then you don't have to list specific currencies and make sure you handle all of them.

I'm going to start looking at the strategy itself tomorrow night hopefully as I'm curious in the finer details of it that are in the code...and to have another set of eyes look over it for any potential concerns.....as long as it's ok with geoff!

Let me know if you have any questions.

Good morning Emanuele!

My live account traded 3 shorts on Alpari also!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
No problem jd this was the purpose of the thread, to get more eyes!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I have seen what happens on other threads but I am hoping that this thread will encourage experienced members continue to help newbie members, as they have been doing so far.

I have seen newbies torn to shreds on other threads and I don't want that to happen here!

However, if it is apparent that new members have not even read post #1 before asking questions, I will be tempted to ignore them.

All suggestions for improvements will be taken on board and, some of them will be tested but my opinion is, "if it ain't broke why fix it" !

Regards

Geoff

No trades on my live account last night - None this week so far.

TP3 10

all perfect

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Are you confident that you have everything set up correctly?

If you want some help just ask!

--- 帖子 #531 ---
It traded last week and i have changed nothing. This is why I NEVER bother with demo - you can get super results in demo - then when you go live ??

So i trade micro live accounts at the testing stange now.

I know broker feeds are all different but the results people are getting are so extreme with this EA.

Lets just see what the rest of the week brings

--- 帖子 #532 ---
My 2 demo and 1 live accounts have all returned error #0 these last few days. I use IamFx and BestDirect, both ECN brokers. Yet backtesting works perfectly. How is that???

It's a tad depressing when others get their pips and mine won't trade.

Sounds like you have hit the nail on the head. Hopefully Sir Geoff will be able to make the changes needed. I'll wait patiently.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #533 ---
We are looking into this, I need the EA to work on ECN brokers!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Same here. Alpari UK Live GMT 2

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Great!

If we average 20 pips a day, that's 100 a week, the mind boggles!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I've been out of town and just now read your post (3:50 a.m. here).  I reduced my % to .02 and got roughly $10 out of the trade with all three in profit!  Wow.  Can't go far on that...

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hi Mary

I know having a small account and trying to stay safe and only risk 1% is very much like watching paint dry , realistically you need at least $5k in your account before 1% makes any kind of sense!

But our EA will hit the stoploss sooner or later, it's good but it's not perfect, and when that happens you will be glad that you were careful!

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Yeah, but it still makes me sad...

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Sorry!

--- 帖子 #540 ---
it seems that even inside one broker (eg Alpari UK live) trades could be different...  for the broker...for me nothing tonight with this one...

only v5b and adx mods...

so bad i dont have enough time..

to consider master-slave bridge...???

--- 帖子 #541 ---
There's always tomorrow!

No trades for me as well with Alpari UK today.

On TDFX demo
CamvcvooV3
TP1 22
TSL 21
Third order still running, it could hit SL we’ll see

All entries were triggered @ 1.4302
Geoff, the third order is left without a trailing stop right? That is unless TP2 is reached for 50 then it would trail the third one to 50… however when the second trailing stop is hit the third order is left to run… Is my understanding correct?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
The third order should have closed at +10 pips, if it didn't then something has gone wrong with the stoploss on that order!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Right right I remember now... but how could this have happened? Could it be related to a connection issue... Suppose my connection got cut while the third order was still running, from what I gather all Stops would have already been entered at the broker... The stop for third trade on my screen is the initial stop of 140...

--- 帖子 #546 ---
That is a possibility if it happened after TP1 closed, this is when TP2 trailing stoploss moves to break-even and TP3 stoploss is moved to BE +10.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
A promising start. Alpari UK Demo. Thanks Geoff.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Ok... but the strange thing is that I booked the TP2 trailing stop at 21.... hmmm puzzling

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Ah, if only it would trade every day like that!

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Using v3 it would be difficult for the EA to miss the TP3 stoploss adjustment because it was doing it on every tick, that is why I modified it in v3a.

It sounds more like the EA lost control of the open order before it moved the stoploss up to +10, which would mean it lost it immediately after it moved the TP2 stoploss up to break-even.

It is difficult to see how it could go wrong but, obviously it did!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Babypips is how I got started too and recommend to anyone interested in forex.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
@ Geoff

Many Thanks in the first place!

I read the code of your sharp EA.

I have an impression that daily hi/lo and pivot/targets those drawn on the chart are not really related to your entries, are they？

the entry algorithm is concise and original, nice work!

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thanks a lot Geoff, but I can't seem to find a V3a here... I thought the latest was the V3...

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Yes, the daily pivot and daily range are just for information!

Thank you for the kind words, simple and concise was the original plan!

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Sorry v2a to v3 it is, please make allowances for my great age!

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Does anyone have any of Geoff's wonderful EAs on a live account of $10,000 or more?  If so, which one/s and how are they doing?  Which broker?

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Mary, Geoff has already responded that sooner or later, the stop loss will be hit. That is 420 pips. At 20 cents a pip, that's $84.00. At .50 cents a pip, it's $210.00. On a $1,000.00 account, that's a loss of 21% on one trade, which would take you quite awhile to get back.

That same .50 a pip would have made you $25.00 in one day using your example of making "only" $10.00 at .20 a pip. Not bad at all on a $1,000.00 account. IF you were risking a loss on a one to basis of that same $25.00, that would be one thing. BUT...you are risking a loss of almost TEN times that much.

IF someone had an EA with this kind of win ratio with a potential loss of only the same as the potential win, it would be the holy grail of forex. The reason this EA has a back test of an extremely high percentage of wins is precisely because the risk to reward is very high, and people need to keep in mind this fact, and risk only money that they can afford to lose if maybe there are a few weeks that get 5 or more losses because the market has changed.

As Geoff said, you need an account of about $5,000.00. I personally have lost a substantial sum in forex years ago because of a system that was "foolproof". Today, I would much rather make $25.00 a day than lose a thousand in one day.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I agree with paradoxical.  It was optimized using the optimizer to get those large stop losses.  If you are averaging $60 a win from all 3 trades and have an average of 8 trades for each per month (24 individual trades), then if you have 5 losing trades, you'll blow away all your earnings in the past 5 months.  Obviously if this happens early, then that is really bad.

What needs to happen is lower the stoploss and find out how to exclude or try to exclude those losing trades by some other indicator.  Let us know your ideas.  We can make those changes and rerun through backtest to see results, but even if it brings up a few more losses but lowers the potential loss from 420 to even lower than 100 pips (maybe around 30 pips for each), then that is a big difference and can make the difference between a strategy that can look really good and then wipe your account as soon as you load up with more lots compared to one that can be used for months/years to come with controlled risks.

Thanks for the cautionary tales.  Maybe Version 4 would be the right plan for now.

LOL... The third trade just hit SL... I will watch it carefully tonight that's if we get a trade

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi Geoffb65,

Yesterday I have no trades with AlpariUK and FXCM (demo accounts both)

I never used a EA before so i don't know if I'm doing it right.

I made it by the simple way, open the EA without any change. The only modification I heard in this tread is for the time, but it is already preparate for Alpari with a deftual number 2. Anything else?

--- 帖子 #562 ---
My Alpari UK account traded yesterday but I don't think it will today.

You are correct, the defaults are set for Alpari UK.

Have you got a smiley face on your platform and live trading allowed?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Mary - just closed account with Go Markets and opening with new broker - but it'll take about 5 days or so for wire transfer to get in so I can start trading live again. Right now I'm monitoring v6 - v7a - Camvcvoo3 & 3a on demo with 4 different brokers. Will let you know what I decide to do based on results.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
A performance report is in the very first post of the thread.

Perhaps going to mt4 site or just googling installing an EA would get you going.

Pretty basic stuff

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Just an idea.

Maybe we can setup a SKYPE group for this and communicate outside this FF site. Would be faster in updating.

I go by a number of rules when I do training:

1. Have finished www.babypips.com

2. Learned from your broker how to run your platform.

3. Have www.teamviewer.com installed, so I can help directly on your pc when stuck, plus show my screens if needed.

4. Have www.skype.com installed, and have audio capabilities. Refuse to sit typing and typing, while modern facilities are available to make the job at hand easier, lol

If above is not met, I am not wasting my time on helping people.

After all, one needs to get the tools before addressing a job.

This way a lot of work can be done fast and easy problems fixed in a jiffy.

Hi Freddyfx

Do I take it that you are volunteering to offer these services to the members of the thread, if so I am impressed and really I appreciate your selfless offer!

--- 帖子 #574 ---
don't know what went wrong but yesterday trades 2 closed in profit but one reach SL at 140. using v3.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I may need to add multiple re-tries to the SL adjustment on TP3, it only has one chance at the moment and if your broker is busy the modify order may be missed.

Unfortunately, there is no way to simulate error signals in the tester!

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Yo, no trades last night on Alpari. Good, PA was choppy.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Yes, I think we were better off out of it!

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Let me again remind you to a master-slave-system. A demo-account almost never requotes an order for SL. You are able to adjust the amount of re-tries and slippage for all orders. I assume you are using a vps for EA-applications.

Freddy, please count me in for a skype chat. Gladly will explain how to set up such a system for all interested trader. Unfortunately the setup is not so easy. The settings have to be absolutely correct.

Happy pipin to all.

Steve

--- 帖子 #579 ---
First check that the Expert Advisor tab towards the top of your MT4 platform is showing a Green flag, if not, click on it and it will change.

Second goto Tools, Options, Expert Advisors and make sure that these boxes are ticked, Enable Expert Advisors, Allow Live Trading, Allow DLL Imports and Allow external experts imports.

All the others should be un-ticked!

Let me know if this changes your  to this

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hello,

I think a slave-master system is also useless in my opinion. Your demo account can accept the trade or mod but after that it passes to your live account were you will also have requotes and all the stuff. A trade acepted by your demo account does not mean that it it will be acepted by your live account, that simple.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Yes, that is a possibility, but if the retries fail after those 10 attempts, then you Print to the journal saying it failed.  This is how you know.  In fact, I've always printed even after one retry because I'm curious how good brokers are during peak hours.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Geoff.

Looking into that.

Normally I train ppl on a direct basis, not really a group chat type here.

PLUS: I am struggling with the same problems as you mentioned in the thread about trading altogether, that is why I am glancing at automation with a good EA.

Problem is, tested a number over the yrs, none really did the job I expected, but then most probably in the beginning I was too greedy anyhow, lol.

Another SUPER important matter is that I am not responding to my Skype when I am trading, as I have a TRADER pc and a SUPPORT pc and they stand under an angle with each other. Distraction is murder when you are trading.

One more subject I like to repeat here in this thread:

One needs only 20 pips/day to make a good income per month, IF you are funded properly of course. Tendency is with most traders they NEVER seem to make enough pips.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I have the same problem trying to split my time which is why I limit my involvement to the forum, I don't do training I leave that to the experts!

I am more than happy with 100 pips a week however, I have 3 EA's running at the same sort of level so I don't do any manual trading any more.

Best wishes!

I have a question guys.

If I run two EAs on the same pair will there be any problems?

I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi Geoff,

I see you are still doing a great for all traders on your tread. Please do not loose your touch. Thanks

I have been away from my computer for a couple days. I find on my journal V3 has traded only on May 19 no trades for May 20. I use 3 MT4 brokers and only IBFX traded. All demo accounts up till now.

IBFX sell trade triggered and went down to 1.42355. 2 1/2 pips short of TP1. Then retreated back up and all 3 trades went to SL - 420 pips. The daily low on Jadefx was 1.42370 at TP1, and would have got TP1 and also saved TP2 and TP3. TDFX when down to 1.4236 and also would have saved trade. Both of the last did not take the trade.

That is the way forex trade goes.

I do not think we will have a trade tonight. In back testing I found this EA only taking trade on average 3 trades a week. Only good trades I hope.

You are doing a great job Geoff. Please do not stop.

joet

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I agree, don't see the right setup.

No trade.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
You can run more than one EA on the same pair so long as they each have their own unique magic number.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Well it's my first post on FF or any Forex board for that matter.  I felt compelled to stop lurking and register just so I could say Bravo Geoff and team.

Outstanding pair of threads you have.  I've read this entire thread tonight and I'm very impressed with the knowledged shared.  I'm also excited by the back test results I've had so far.  I've backed test the EA at least 20 times this evening and all of the test showed phenomal results all the way back to the middle of 2009.

Now to go read your other monster.  Well maybe tommorow.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Yes, I used to "lurk", it's very frustrating!

Glad to have you on board, please keep posting!

hi there!

Impressive results out here !!!

(So much) better than our London Breakout stuff ! (so far...  )

Has anyone of you tried on different pairs ?

Why would it be limitted to GU only ?

If market changes to the point that it is not profitable on GU before April 2009, as FunDemental says, then it means other pairs could very well fit this strat at some point.

Seeing that it takes very few trades per day, and trades are open only during very short periods of time, we could very well run it on multiple pairs in parallel, hoping that trades won't overlap (with 420 pips SL per pair, that would become quite "slippery"...)

I quickly backtested it on EU for may, and got similar results... NORTH*NORTH*NORTH all the way thru to Jupiter...

Trades on GU and EU overlap only 3 times out of 11 overall traded days:

GU: 03,---05,---07,11,---13,---17,19

EU:     ---04,05,06,------12,---14,17,19.

Other pairs could give also pretty good results.

How about using different trading hours based on pair sessions, such as USD pairs, JPY pairs, GPB or EUR pairs ?

This all looks pretty good, doesn't it ?

Other pairs have been tested on the other thread, which is the same basic strategy but only places 1 or 2 orders.

The results have been "variable" to say the least and just recently with intervention on the EURO, they have been very erratic on EURo pairs.

One major problem we get is with different brokers and the smoothing that they apply to the data feed, STP and ECN feeds do seem to get better results and more trades but it is probably too early to be sure about this!

It is certainly something for the future though!

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Indeed...

I backtested EU over 2010... and got 5 losses (420 pips each... OOoouch! ).

Which wiped out the small profits aquired all along (and much more...)

Remark on the v3 code:

when Hide_Targets==true, it misses to send order #3... (both on buy and sell).

(the "Close Orders" code section does take care of all 3 trades SL/TP)

Sq.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I think it may be possible with other pairs using different start times!

Hide_Targets is not available on v3, this is from the EA on the other thread where hide_targets is available, it was dangerous with 3 orders being managed by the EA, I am not very happy with the idea at all.

There is a problem with moving the stoploss on TP3 which I have now cured by doing multiple retries of the OrderModify function, I should be releasing the new version shortly.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Yes, multiple retries may be needed to work-around the "trade context busy" errors...

I have coded myself "reliable" versions of Orderxxxx() functions that i use in my EAs, if you want to use them, feel free to do so;

Simply add a preceeding _ on the OrderModify() calls in your code, so they turn into _OrderModify(), and that's it.

(and get rid of the polluting repeat code of course...)

I have the same approach for OrderSend() and OrderClose() and OrderDelete().

This makes the code a lot cleaner.

Inserted Code //need this for ErrorDescription()
#include <WinUser32.mqh>
#include <stdlib.mqh>

#define MAX_RETRIES 10

//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
bool _OrderModify(int ticket, double price, double stoploss, double takeprofit, datetime expiration, color arrow_color)
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
{
//"reliable" version of OrderModify(): will retry 10 times before failing

Another question:

i see you have defined

extern double iTrailingStop2 = 50;

But it is not used.

As far as i understand the code, locking-in 10 pips profit on order3 when it has reached 22 pips profit.

While order2 is moved to BE after 22 pips profit, and then is trailed at 22 pips.

Am i interpreting the code correctly ?

(I had a hard time following the code logic with one_shot and two_shot...)

SQ.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Yes that is correct, I had thought about having a second stoploss but abandoned the idea.

My code is full of old crap from things I have tried and abandoned!

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hi Geoff,

While I was testing different larger TPs and SLs I noticed that until a short trade hasn't finished, another short cannot be entered. Same with longs of course. In other words, only one trade at the same time on the same side.

Have you got an explanation?

Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #611 ---
That is correct, this is to reduce exposure to having, possibly, 6 open orders in the same direction each carrying 140 stoploss!

--- 帖子 #612 ---

Lol he just opened a revolutionary and innovative thread based on trendline breakouts. Wow! This maybe the holly grail hahaa.

Ok now let's get back to work to perfect this great ea!!!

--- 帖子 #619 ---
a big part of the success of this ea is that it targets a specific market time which is seen to give significant moves...

kudos

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Yes, just change this line

if(allow_buy == true && buyorder==0 && Time0 != Time[0])

to this

if(allow_buy == true && buyorder<=3 && Time0 != Time[0])

And this line

if(allow_sell == true && sellorder==0 && Time0 != Time[0])

to this

if(allow_sell == true && sellorder<=3 && Time0 != Time[0])

That should do the trick!

--- 帖子 #621 ---
I'm new to the world of auto trading. So you know this is a dumb question..

If there is a power outage and the  ea is running and gets interrupted what happens to any open trades? Are they already set with stops and limits so power or no power for my computer the broker already has the stops and limits?

Thanks much..

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Twat

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Yes the EA sends TP & SL values with the order however, for the trailing stoploss to work your computer must be connected.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Very succinct!

--- 帖子 #625 ---
If you hide your s/l & t/p levels from broker and you lose power the trade will continue on it's own, and will ignore (since the broker hasn't the information from your EA) any s/l or t/p levels.  Solution to this problem is subscribe to an VPS service (Forex.com provides it free) or turn off "Hide" in your EA.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hide_targets is not available on the 3 order version of the EA, I decided it was too dangerous with 3 open orders.

But you are correct, a VPS is ideal for running EA's.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
I think, question was about trailing SL. Will EA "patronige" over opened orders and update their stoplosses, after MT4 was disconnected and then connected again?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
thank you for the knowledgeable responses...

very helpful...

GMT setting?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hi Geoffb65,

I was making a manual backtest. And I see that chart, according to the rules it's a correct entry point, both SMA are up between 23-00 (i'm with alpari +2GMT). But in your Report there is not a trade for that day. Am I wrong?

The trade was 2010.04.06 at 01:00

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Vide supra! ( ((latine ))

--- 帖子 #636 ---
The EA might not have traded because the M15 and M5 fractals did not agree with the two SMA's.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
You have still not told us, what is your GMT offet setting?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Incorrect!

You do not multiply everything by 10 for this EA!

But please check your broker GMT offset!

--- 帖子 #639 ---
That's right, the EA already takes care of 4/5 digits brokers for you: all input values are in PIPS, whatever broker you use.

TP1 set to 14 means 14 pips.

140 means 140 pips.

BTW running backtest with MT4 during the week-end (= markets closed) makes it use VERY HIGH SPREAD values: i get 8.1 pips spread currently during the week-end with Alpari on GU... (81 "points", Alpari is also 5-digits)

Where the usual typical range is 0.6~1.5pips during the week.

As far as i know, MT4 does not know how to determine the real spread during backtest, so it simply uses the "last known" spread value...

So you get 8pips spread when running backtest during the w-e, and only 0.6p when  backtesting during the week days.

That will make a HUUUGE difference in backtest results!

Well, unless there is an option (that i don't know of) that would allow to force the spread value for backtesting purposes, which would be nice...

If anyone knows how to do that, i'd be very happy to know about it!

sq.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
I am told, but I have not tried this, that the larger weekend spread only applies to demo accounts and if you do your testing with a live account you should get "standard" spread values.

I haven't tried it because I do enough testing during the week and look forward to a couple of days off!

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Regarding the 4 or 5 digit case, I have a question that you may know something about.

The EA uses the quoted Ask and Bid prices to generate the order but I have had occasions where a 4 digit broker (TDFX) quotes 5 digit prices, so when the EA uses these to generate the order it is rejected!

This could be because TDXF are STP so the prices quoted come direct from the market as 5 digits but it is a problem!

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Ask and Bid are prices, so are not expressed in pips or points or anything else but just the currency itself.

So it does matter using 4,5, or 6 digs brokers: Ask and Bid will just have 4,5, or 6 digits after the coma: 1.5123 or 1.51234 or 1.512345 for instance.

What can make a difference is the slippage, which is expressed in "points", and THAT will be different between 4,5,6 brokers: a slippage of 3 pips should be sent as 3,30, or 300 depending on the broker.

A slippage value of 3 on a 5-digits broker will be actually 0.3 pips only, and 0.03 pips only on a 6-digits broker, and that has a much higher risk of being rejected.

When opening orders, the slippage value should take care of this.

The EA uses a fixed slippage of 5, meaning 0.5 pip on 5-digs broker.

If the intention was to set it to 5 pips, then the EA should be changed to use 50 instead.

You can change it to be "5*Poin/Point" to solve this.

Sq

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Ah, thank you for that, I use x*Poin for everything else, never thought of using it with the slippage as well!

--- 帖子 #644 ---
There was a potential problem in v3 that could have resulted in the

stoploss not being modified for the third order.

V4 fixes this issue and includes a change suggested by squalou that

should reduce the differences experienced between different brokers.

There are no changes to the way the strategy works but the problem

with the stoploss on the third order means that it is important to
upgrade your EA to V4 as soon as possible.

The files in post #1 have also been updated.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi Geoff, Thought I should stop lurking and say hi.

I'm new to EA's and have never even tried to use one before! After reading this and your other thread I am very impressed with the results and the way that you have presented everything and answered everyones questions.

I'm so impressed, that i am going to put this on my demo (alpari uk) tonight! I'll keep you upto date with the results.

Keep up the great work

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Please can you clarify this, is 5*Poin or Point or is it 5*Poin divided by Point?

--- 帖子 #647 ---
5*Poin divided by Point

=5*Poin/Point

You use "Poin" to express the pip value; (i call it "pip" in my EAs, so there is no confusion  )

Sq

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Geoff.

Another option has been challenging me.

Suppose I see a good setup and like to activate a trade manually during other trading hrs.

Is there a way that can be done?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
The default settings do give a higher profit with a slightly higher risk whereas the new settings are far more conservative with "little" chance of a loss but with a lower overall profit.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Not with the EA, it only trades at 23:00 GMT but of course you can trade manually at any time however, it would be wise to do this from a separate chart.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Guess I still need my morning coffee first

I am talking about taking a manual trade on another hr of the day and still use the MM part of it, as that intrigues me most.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
I looked in those timeframe and both SMA are up in M15 and M5

--- 帖子 #659 ---
The SMA's are not the same as fractals, these are created by high and low points and are

an important part of the EA strategy.

In MT4 go into indicators where you will find Fractals, click and drag onto your chart and

you will see where they are formed.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Thanks again geoff.

I'm sorry I didn't know about that indicator.

So after 23:00 GMT we wait for a fractals in both timeframes in the direcction that we want. For exampel if we want to buy we wait for a Fractal up, no?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
During the 23:00 GMT H1 bar we look for the latest locked M15 fractal to be opposite to the direction of the SMA's, this can be in the previous H1 bar.

This may seem strange but if we wait for the next M15 fractal to form we would be too late to catch the move.

Then we look for a locked M5 fractal to be in the same direction as the SMA's, locked means that we have waited for the third bar after the fractal is first drawn to be certain it will not redraw.

The M5 fractal gives us a good entry point!

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Great, thanks Geoff

--- 帖子 #663 ---
just want to check something...

If i set mm to true and set medium risk true, do i need to set manual lots to false?

I stepped camvcvooV4 through 31 levels of risk using the MT4 optimizer. I'm still at the "monkey with a stick" level when using MT4's optimizer and MQL4 so review my results with that in mind.

I loaded the tester with the conservative settings as listed on the first post then incrementally stepped by risk 1 percent/per trade from 1 to 31. So at the max step of 31 the tester was trading 93% acount value per setup.

Same as my previous post #679 but this time stepping the iRiskPercent incremental from 1 - 31 on the Default settings. Both test were run using the "Every Tick" modeling.  I'm optimizing the settings as well.

You need to download the larger database for your history centre.

Back again. My router died yesterday. Had to get a new one.

I picked both of these brokers because they were ECN with low spreads. IamFX has the smaller spread. They are both 5 digit brokers.

My trades were still being taken in v.7 with last one being 12th May.

Since then I have error #0

camv last worked on 13/5 on my live account, whatever version that was!

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I have used the EA on an ECN account and so have other people so

we know that it can work with them.

Error #0 means the order has failed but there was no reason given which

is not very helpful!

I may have asked this before but are these results from live or back testing?

I ask because as a rule whatever happens with back testing will also

happen when you go live.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Backtesting works fine on all. No problems

It's only live transactions that bring the error.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
If the EA works ok on back testing then it should work exactly the same live, the

only difference is that with live accounts such things as margin requirements and

real account balances are taken into account.

This beats me, there has got to be some unknown factor causing this!

The charts are setting up for a sell tonight.  I will be nice to see a trade.  I always like it when the EA enters the right direction.  There should be plenty of room for the EA to take all 3 TP's to profit.  Unless big movements happen in the next 3 hrs.

Hi Geoff,

I am a manual trader and my charts and indicators indicate a movement down to the 1.4280 level.  Maybe a little short of that. The USD is much stronger than the GBP for tonight.  Only the market knows for sure.  That what makes this very interesting.  I would normally not trade this pair tonight.  A sell on the AUDJPY may be the best for tonight.  I am not recommending that trade I use it for an example.  Still to early to tell.  A good night to curl up with mama.  With a bottle of good wine.

Good luck.

Hi Geoff, top of the morning to you when you get this.

I've tried a few of the older versions today and fiddled with the settings to see what I might have done to get the "error #0" message on my ECN brokers. GU didn't trade but the EU tried to activate a few trades.

And the results? Drumroll please .........

Hide_Targets must be set to "true" to be accepted by the broker. That is why I've had no results with these EA's of late.

When it was suggested on the other thread to show targets in case my computer disconnects and loses control of the trade, that is what I did all round. I didn't get any trades anywhere after that.

But with this EA there is no option to show targets for the reason mentioned above.

Dear Sir Geoff, is it possible for a man of your capabilities, to add this option onto this EA for people that really need it?  The queue starts behind me! I'd be as happy as a pig in mud!

Cheers!

Good morning!

The other EA works with ECN because we hide the TP & SL, ECN does not work if you send this data with the OrderSend routine, then the EA monitors the trade begining to end and closes the trades at SL or TP.

The method works with ECN but a kind gentleman pointed out a couple of days ago that the method I used was incorrect and would not be accepted by a "true" ECN broker, whatever that is!

There is a thread on FF where the correct method is discussed but I have not finished reading it yet, when I have I will try to apply it to both EA's.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
The start time is 23:00 GMT and the GMT offset value is the difference between

your brokers time and GMT which looks like it should be +3.

Didnt work out - stopped out on all three orders -420 pips Lucky its only a micro live account. It turned short straight way after hitting SL

Changed my time setting now to 3 - hopefully I will get it back. Not sure why a hour can make so MUCH difference - but thems the rools I suppose.

Sorry!

One hour either way makes a massive difference!

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Dear Geo,

Why did ur EA stop at 6 trades only? Is it that selective?

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Yes, it decided to rest!

The conditions are very exacting and it will not trade unless everything

is just right which is good because when it does trade it will seldom

make a loss but it is a nuisance when it doesn't trade.

Over 12 months it will trade about 90 days.

Salutations fellow fxers.

Could someone please help me out here.

V4 has not managed to place a trade since I downloaded it on Monday.

I have not changed any settings other than magic number and comments( which did not save, every time I click on the Ea file it shows the defaults for these, camvcooV3 etc)

I had to download the V4exe file to get the normal version to open, so I have both versions.(deleted and reinstalled x2)

I have the smiley face.

Have set to allow dlls and live trading.

Using an Alpari Uk demo account to forward test (hopefully).

I was thinking about this for a while and I wonder has anyone looked at obtaining a better price once the signal is given. Lets say that  once the signal to trade is given you could always obtain a 5 pip better price. It might not sound much but it could be more than that.

Just wondering if anyones looked at this.

All the best

OK

I am out of here, made enough pips for this week and as it is the end of the month, not planning to give a single pip back.

A retired Dutch banker once taught me this trick: DON'T TRADE ON FRIDAYS, it is where the smart asses often give back their winnings.

Wishing all a relaxed weekend and will inform the results of this position when it is finished.

Thanks for this EA -

Was in at 1.45604 at 01:40 Alpari Uk.

1st one just closed in profit..2nd two still running in profit - stops have been raised so no losses on this one!

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Good morning all.

I had two orders trigered on my Alpari UK demo last night. I think a disconnection just before the trigger cause the loss of the first order.  The remaining two hit SL but ended up in a small profit becuase of the trailing stop.

The trades are below and logs attached.

Both trades were exactly the same as follows:

Open Time: 2010.05.28 01:30

Type: Buy

Price:   1.45511

S / L   1.45587

T / P   1.46011

Close Time 2010.05.28 02:06

Price 1.45587

Profit (pips) 7.60

Have a great weekend.

Well it didn't exist then!

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I don't think it has anything to do with when it was created, as it should function to its internal logic, unless a date block is included in some way, but then I am not a coder and am just evaluating such a statement as an engineer.

I still would like to be able to activate a trade triggering the EA manually, if that can be incorporated, as there are multiple good entries during a day and how to trigger the sweetheart....................

--- 帖子 #778 ---
The EA is optimised for the past 12 month period and maybe the price action

that I spotted didn't occur more than 12 months ago!

I plan on re-optimising at regular intervals but always for the past 12 months

as I don't know of any EA that always worked and always will work for ever!

Your manually triggered idea is already available on FF where you trigger the

trade manually and the EA monitors it for you, I have seen EA's like this

on the forum before, so I don't plan on converting this EA to do anything

like that, why re-invent the wheel?

We should be able to average 20 pips a day profit which, for me, is profit

while I sleep!

20 pips/day is ALL that is needed towards the million.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Hi Geoff,

First of all, great job in developing this amazing strategy and EA . I'm always sceptical when I see EA results like those you show on page 1 but, sure enough, I tried your EA and it works great .

If you don't mind, I have a few suggestions on how to polish up the coding of the EA. The polish won't effect the great results in anyway but should make the EA more efficient and easier to maintain going forward. I'm a computer programmer by profession but nothing to do with FX or the financial markets. However, I have been interested in Technical Analysis for 10 years and I've been dabbling with EAs for a while now. I would be happy to help.

So if you don't mind here are just a few suggestions having looked through camvcvooV5.mq4 (I'd be happy to make these changes myself and send them yo you):

1) The code that works out the average and current daily range should be enclosed in an if(Show_Settings) { ... } so that this computation is only done if really needed - working this out on every tick when you don't need it will waste CPU.

2) The 15min Fractal code that works out TimeOfLastUpFractal_H1 and TimeOfLastDownFractal_H1 is currently being called at every tick. This should be moved down to where the Place Order code is after it checks Hour() == trade_hour so that the 15min fractals are only queried when needed. This should speed things up a bit more.

3) Is the code under the Close Orders comment still needed or was this only needed when there was an option to enter positions without a SL and TP ?

4) In a number of places there are 2 calls to GetLastError() to check if an OrderSend/OrderModify was successful or not. The first checks for the success of the Order and the second prints out the error number if it wasn't. The problem with this is that the first call to GetLastError() resets the error number so the second call will always return 0. I'm sure reading through this thread a number of people have been getting Error # 0 messages and could not figure out what was wrong.

To remedy this you should use the return value from OrderSend/OrderModify to determine success or failure of the command. OrderSend returns the ticket number of the order or -1 if it fails and OrderModify returns true or false depending on whether the order was modified successfully or not. So I suggest the following style:

int ordTicket = OrderSend(...);

if(ordTicket == -1) {

Print("Buy OrderSend 1 failed with error #", GetLastError());

sleep(1000);

}

bool modOK = OrderModify(...);

if(!modOK) {

Print("Buy Order 3 Modify Failed With Error #", GetLastError());

sleep(1000);

}

5) In V5 I see the OrderSend has been split into an OrderSend (without SL and TP) followed by an OrderModify (with SL and TP) but I think there could be an issue here because the OrderModify may fail for some reason and it will go back around the retry loop issuing multiple OrderSends until the OrderModify succeeds.

6) There is a lot of repeated code for handling each of the 3 orders. For example you could create a sendOrder(int orderNumber, double takeProfit) function that contains the common code and just call it 3 times:

sendOrder(1, TakeProfit1);

sendOrder(2, TakeProfit2);

sendOrder(3, TakeProfit3);

int sendOrder(int orderNumber, double takeProfit) {

int retries =10;

while(retries > 0) {

RefreshRates();

int iTicket=OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,dLots,Ask,3*Poin,0,0,trade_comment,iMagicNumber,0,Blue);

bool xbool = OrderSelect(iTicket, SELECT_BY_TICKET);

OrderModify(iTicket,0,OrderOpenPrice()-Poin*StopLoss,OrderOpenPrice()+Poin*takeProfit ,0,CLR_NONE);

//OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, dLots, Ask, 3*Poin/Point, Ask - StopLoss * Poin, Ask + TakeProfit1 * Poin, trade_comment, iMagicNumber, 0, Blue);

if(GetLastError() < 0)

{

Print("Buy OrderSend ", orderNumber, " failed with error #", GetLastError());

Sleep(1000);

}

else

{one_shot=0;

break;}

retries--;

}//end while

}

Piptician

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Victor, good morning to you!

Did you ever think about the following:

Backtesting v7a 2 leg strategy vs 3 leg strategy brings the following results:

v7a has roughly max drawdown of 55% of 3 leg strategy but produces 65% of profit if backtested till 1st of Jan 2010. Hence profitability probability is better if you double up v7a instead of using 3leg strategy.

Make up your mind and tell me what you think plse? Would be really interested because I am thinking towards increasing my risk profile and wonder if this would be a better way to facilitate......

cheers

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Hi Roman, honestly speaking, i really don't know. I have not done any backtest on any of the two EA. I just use them live forward until either one breaks down (hopefully never!).

To me, the bet is for GU move +22 pips in our favour. Once reach, everything else is bonus. If that the case, with 3 legs, i get minimum +22 and +10. With 2 legs, i only get +22 minimum.

Geoff, what do you think?

Regards,

Victor V

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I am very impressed with the results we have had for this EA and I thank you for coming up with the idea.

For me, 3 orders is a bit of a problem because I tend to work on a much lower risk than many people,

even 2 consecutive orders is high risk for me!

The ideal EA for me would place a single order, make a profit and get out within the hour, anything that

runs for longer than an hour is too stressfull!

That's why manual trading is no good for me!

--- 帖子 #798 ---
no orders for me last night. I turned on maybe 30 minutes after market open.  Is that a prob?

--- 帖子 #799 ---
No, I don't think anyone got a trade, you can turn on right up to the start time with no problems!

--- 帖子 #800 ---
cool geoff, thanks.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
I should have explained my last post a bit better!

The EA does nothing all day, that's the life, then at the start time it looks back

to the two previous hours for the "trend" if they agree it then looks to the M15

and M5 fractals for a suitable entry point.

Of course, if the two SMA's do not agree, it takes the next day off as well!

--- 帖子 #802 ---
right. So i believe we had trend short, so in this , it was the fractal portion that did not fire..  Which was good!

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Still no losers Geoff so your EA has now achieved VPS status. Another dozen trades since the screen shot below.

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...2&d=1274276168

However, as your EA is now hosted on my UK VPS - before it was local here in Malta - I think I would be correct in saying that I do not need to change the settings?

Same broker Alpari UK for Malta and the UK VPS. The UK server time is different though. UK time obviously. But the broker time is still the same.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
That's right, it's only the broker GMT offset that matters!

Which version of the EA are you using?

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Thanks.

Version not sure. It has a 18128 magic if that helps. Memory isn't what it was, I am getting on, you know.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
That will be v3, we are on v5 now, but it's working for you!

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Yup, I'll stick with it. Cheers mate.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Geoffb65, many thanks for your EA and for helping forum members!

I've just put v5 on a MBT demo account.

I've some questions about the right GMT offset.

Does the Tokyo session start at 0.00 GMT, so the EA should start at 23.00?

If so, that would be at my 19.00 broker time. So I think GMT offset should be -4 for MB Trading. However, the MB Trader helpdesk told me GMT offset is -5 during DST. Does anyone the right GMT Offset for MB Trading?

EDIT: i think I now know the right answer by myself: Tokyo starts at 23.00 GMT: http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/i...=GMT&refresh=5 so the EA should start at 22.00 GMT. The default start time of the EA is 23.00. At that time it's 18.00 my broker time, so the right GMT offset should be -5 during DST, like the MBT people said.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
1)Put this indicator in meta trader experts/indicators directory,

2)Then load this indicator to your chart(you need to enable external dll calls).

3)Set myGMT value to your GMT offset( For example i am in Tokyo, so my GMT for me is 9)

If you enter that right, after indicator is loaded you should see

"Broker Name "  :  (+/-)xx GMT           [ if it minus add 24 and enter in ea as GMT, other wise just enter the value for ea]

Broker             :  xx.xx

Spread            :  x.x

Local               :  xx.xx                    [ this should be same as your computer local time, see the bottom of screen right hand side]

New York         :  xx.xx

London            :  xx.xx

Tokyo             :  xx.xx                     [ I see this also same as my local time ,because i am live here]

Sorry for my bad English, but hope this helps!!

Thank you. I see my local time right at 07.49 1/6, which is OK, but GMT is at 07.49 27/5. MB Trading offset is 8 in this indicator. I'm affraid this won't help me, but thanks for your support.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
No trades on Alpari Live this night and I think it's also good so.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Thank you, it seems MBT is -4, think you're right.

But now the following: Tokyo starts at 23.00 GMT: http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/i...=GMT&refresh=5

Then the EA should start at 22.00 GMT (1 hour before Tokyo open): http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=236012 "This EA places its orders during the hour before Tokyo opens".

However, the default setting start time of the EA is 23.00. If not changing that, should I not set GMT offset to -5 in this case?

Another possibility is to set start time to 22.00 and GMT offset to -4. But in that case, you and others are taking wrong trades...

Crucial question is: which time GMT should the EA start.

--- 帖子 #817 ---

--- 帖子 #823 ---
I don't really know but this does tend to happen when the SMA's are very flat

through the 21:00 to 22:00 GMT period, maybe it is something to do with timing

and the different data feed characteristics.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hey Geoff - like many before - thank you for sharing this!

I'm back testing as I write this and first trade was a winner!

A couple of quick (hopefully) questions if I may:

1) I noticed this thread and the original one. Are they basically the same but this particular one splits the trades into 3.

2) Is it worth testing both EA, or similar enough to stick to just one.

3) I read one of your posts about optimisation. So this is something which must be done on a regular basis to keep the EA running optimally? How often is regularly?

Thanks heaps!

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Hope you stayed with it!

--- 帖子 #826 ---
This is embarrassing to admit but I just discovered that I had V5 enabled on LIVE.  Must have got confused from switching between live and demo all the time . Such a stupid mistake!

However all three trades just ended +22, +50, +13 so I am happy .

I have a desktop that I keep running for Live trading and a laptop for Demo. But I was switching between live and demo on my laptop last night and must have just left on on live.  So lesson learned is to strictly keep one platform for demo and the other for live and never mix.  I'm not making this mistake again.

So I might as well keep it on live from now on

This EA is exactly the same as the 2 order EA with the addition of an extra

order that is designed to compensate for the trailing stoploss being triggered

on the second order, giving it space to make a profit!

I suppose it is down to risk aversion, if you can withstand 3 x 140 pip losses or

only 2 x 140 pip losses, that is the choice!

I think re-optimisation may be required but not too often, maybe when we

get a loss will be a good time to take a fresh look.

You need to download more data for the tester.

Go to MT4, Tools, Options, History Centre and click on GBPUSD

then click Download and follow the instructions.

I'm funding my old FxPro account and firing this EA live also there. I'm just curious to see the differences with Alpari UK. I might even think to skip my tragical trades from last days and just let this wonder do the dirty job for me.

Sounds good to me. Let us know how you do. I should do the same.

Hi everyone,

just a quick head up  comparing different brokers trade results in past 2 days on version 5 :

31st May :

Alpari Russia Demo: No trades

The Collective FX  Demo No trades

The Collective FC Live: No trades.

ATC  Demo:  3 trades , 3 wins (sell):  22 + 11 + 11 pips

1st June :

Alpari Russia Demo: No trades

The Collective FX  Demo No trades

The Collective FC Live: No trades.

ATC  Demo:  3 trades , 3 wins (buy):  22 + 30 + 80 pips

(It is really a shame  I missed that full strike one on my TCF live account )

I have double checked all EA poperties and time settings on all acounts, everthing was good and the EA should have worked correctly on all accounts.

Seeing the situation as this,

it seems like the current conditions are creating very tight windows whether the EA would take or not take trades, making it dependand on every boker's data feed.

However apparently the decission to take trades would have been a very valid and positive one,  so may I suggest to Geoff, (if this is possible) to widen up the entry conditions of the EA in such way, that when such conditions exist like in these 2 days, the EA would be a little more responsive to open trades, so in other words, make sure it would take the trades on most broker's data feeds, and not just on a few of them.

Another approuch would be, we  continue to test the EA on as many different  brokers  as possible and compare results, someone should voulenteer to collect and store all results in an excle file,

so after some time, we might have an idea which broker gives the most and best trade entries...

For the moment, I am considering to use a trade copy software to copy trades from my ATC demo account to my live TCF  account, so I would avoid the secenario to miss  more winning trades like in the past few days...

Cheers,

Michael

Disapointingly no trades were triggered using camvcooV4, on GoMarkets

How's everyone else doing?

Whereas on the 'Simple H1 GBPUSD' thread, everyone's rejoicing and throwing their hats in the air.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I had three profitable lots last night (I am GMT +2). 2 lots were open with V8 and one lot opened with V4.

My demo broker is IBFX.

Regards,

Knez.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
I'm running this on a MIG demo @.3 lots. It popped $349 for me tonight with no problem.  And with Simple 1v8 on Alpari it popped $215 for the 2 trades.  Both sure beats scalping and beating your head against the monitor for 8 - 12 hours a day!

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Would it hurt us if the stop loss was smaller or each order had a separate one?

I took v5 and added stoploss1, stoploss2 and stoploss3 and did some testing.

Right now we use a stop of 140 x 3, which is 420 if we have a BIG loser...

I setup a test to use:

SL1 -  44

SL2 - 100

SL3 - 156

Total = 300

In backtesting since Jan1 we have:

Original V5 = 81 trades for 839 pips your results may vary...

Modified = 81 trades with 780 pips - the smaller stops got hit a couple times

The mod almost gave us the same upside but might make some feel better on the downside...when it happens again.

I won't post the EA because I don't want anyone getting confused. If Geoff, wants to do something like this it's his call. Just opening it up for debate.

Geoff knows the 6 places the code could be modified and the additional vars.

No losers yet, but backtesting had a few in late March and early April. I'm just preparing for a worst case scenario. Like tonight looks even about now. I just don't want to see folks get all agitated and leave the thread because we had a bad day. Trying to avoid the inevitable is wrong.

Hi Ho Silver, Away....!

Had to get that in.

I have used v5 on GoMarkets live these past two days, all successful.

BUT, same EA on some demo's not accepting trade. Experts tab shows "invalid ticket for OrderModify function"

I've had that 4 times now

--- 帖子 #856 ---
goeff,

i think there is a regression in v5: the slippage fields in OrderSend() calls are back to "3*Poin", where they used to be (and should still be) "3*Poin/Point", as i pointed out in a previous post.

Slippage is an integer value (30 for 3 pips in a 5-digits broker for instance).

"3*Poin" will give you 0.00003, which will be interpreted as 0, allowing no slippage at all.

This could very well be the reason for orders being rejected, as Spaghetti noticed.

Hi Geoff,

You are once again doing a super job. Please stay with US.

I have been a manual trader for many years and just resently tied these robots to free up some of my time. I have made every mistake known and unknown. These things are very sensitive. Here is one thing I have found I do and continue to do.

If you are checking your EA menu to see if the settings are correct , unless you are making changes DO NOT push the OK button. Push the cancel button. When you push the OK button the EA is reset with the settings on the menu. It also removes it from the platform. You will have a smiley face a green EA botton, but if you look in the Expert Advisor tab at the bottom if will say EA removed. You think you are OK, but you not. If you are unsure recycle your broker platform. Turn it off then back on. All indicators and EA's will be reinstalled. A clean install. Then ckeck smiley face, EA green button and meaaage that your EA's are initalized and not removed.

Hope this will help.

Wish the best for everyone.

Have deleted V4 and downloaded V5 but cannot open either the exe4 file or the mq4 file.

Firefox wants a program to open the mq4 file with.Any suggestions ladies and gents?

The exe. file wants me to open it with  mqle4 (Default). When I say ok it says I don't have it. But tbh I don't really need the exe. version

Do I need to download the V3 zip file before downloading V5 mq4 file?

What if we test two different time for trade?

I did a test for this from Feb 1 to June 2 on Alpari UK. Image 1 is default value test(23 GMT) and Image 2 is using two different times(23 GMT and 16GMT) with $1000 opening balance. I think you can better test it if you have time.

There are a number of start times that have worked quite well but I aimed

Hi Pipenjoyer

I had the same issue last week. Second and third orders were OK but not the first.  When looking at the logs I found a disconnection and re-login immediately before orders 2 and 3 triggered.  I can only assume the disconnection caused the first order to miss.

Have a look at your logs and see what it says.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
This remark was on page 14 of this thread. Does it mean I have to set MicroOrdersAllowed OR MiniOrdersAllowed to "false"? Or do I do I have nothing to change in the settings except GMT offset?

Thanks,Geoff.

It's on live Forex.com. I checked "journal"'Experts".just stated"loaded successfully"..Yes,it's really trange.

Do you have a different magic number for each one?

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Dear Geoff,

Alas! they have  the same magic number, as the default from EA..I don't know its function and how to play with...Which posts have the explanations?

So that's the problem and answer,yes?

If the first trade (TP1 TP2 & TP3) has been executed, is it oke to turn the laptop off and turn it on again before GMT 23.00 ?  Assuming there's no 2nd trade?

Thank you.

Regards,

Pipenjoyer

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Hi again.  Although the your issue may have been answered by Geoff, remember that MT4 stores the last few days of logs on your hard disk.  Usually in

Program Files/MetaTrader4/logs  (you may have a different path)

--- 帖子 #899 ---
In the EA settings double click on the magic number on one of the charts

and edit the number, if you just add one more digit that will ensure that

there will be no conflict.

Each order has the magic number attached to it so that the EA can

recognise its own trades, if two charts have the same number you can

imagine, there will be confusion!

It's like a lot of things in forex, it is assumed that people know about things

like magic numbers, I'm trying to change attitudes and explain things but

forex forums seem to have a lot of people who don't want to share what

they have discovered, thankfully we have lots of members here who will take

the time to explain.

EDIT:

Forgot to answer your other question!

Once the trades are completed you can switch your computer off.

Dear Geoff &  Zr-fx,

Attachment Attachment Attachment Hi everyone. I'm new here, but have a bit of experience in fx & coding.

Firstly, thanks to geoff for the brilliant work & selfless generosity. Hopefully I can contribute something useful to this forum.

I have tested the EA on 3 different brokers on live accounts, 1-1-2010 to start June 2010, with MT4, b226. Report files attached. (hopefully!)

I firstly tuned the settings for maximum return on GoTrader. I used the same set file, and only set the start_time to optimize in strategy tester, (0-23), Model:every tick. I set the GMTOffset to zero.

Even I am surprised by the different results between brokers!!! Aplari, Fxcm, & Gotrader.

In the Html files from the zip, subtract 1 from the pass number (first column) to get the GMT time. The Gmt time is also represented on the bottom of the gif graf.

Before all testing, I downloaded fresh history data, & defragged the HDD.

Any comments on this?

Thanks Freddy for your email. Yes, that time thing is always a big issue and source of confusion in many FF forums/posts. For that matter I like OANDA since you can set the terminal time to your local time or whatever you prefer. Also training your phsycology to 50:1 leverage is another merit.

IBFX: I have pulled out funds from my live accounts there since the limitation of hedge position effected. If/when they open in UK, I would like my live account transferred automatically, like FXDD Malta did.

Well the "Ny close to Tky open slope continuation" by geoffb65 is an interesting discovery no one else have ever come across as far as I know and hope it stands to market storms in the days to come. He flys glider, and so do I.

Off to tennis now. Have a great weekend.  Akria

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Big differences between brokers, probably much bigger than expected which

makes it difficult to choose between them.

I suppose the problem with this test as it stands is that the only value that

is truly valid is the level shown for 23, as this is the only value that ties in

with the basic strategy, all the other times are looking for the SMA slope

at the wrong time.

Are any of these brokers 4 digit?

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Another profitable night!

If you were wondering how's working with FxPro I'm testing it for a week now and works like a charm even with a slightly bigger profit than alpari. Just put the GMT offset to 3 and the rest can be left to default.

I'm feeling so less stressed since I quitted manual trading.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
How did you manage that?

None of my accounts traded and the SMA's were crossed!

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Are any of these brokers 4 digit?

No, all 5 digit. I have seen the same differences in other EA's. I have used a hybrid martingale on all accounts, it's amazing the difference a couple of pips can make in between brokers. At the end of the day, I have not seen alot of difference over the longer term. But I do think it is advisable to tune for each broker.

I got caught with the martingale on the wrong side of EurAud 2 weeks ago....meltdown! (I don't like to think about it cos It may do more psychological harm!).

Looking at your code, it is easy to mute screen display in code to speed up testing.

if (! IsTesting())

{ object, comment,,,etc}

That works well.

You only need the .exe file. It is a stand alone program. Just delete the other files. The clock will create a file data.zzz to store the clock settings.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Just for good measure you might want to stick a && !IsOptimization() in there too

On the subject of backtesting and optimization, be careful what time of day, or day of week, you run your tests. When I first started running tests I could not understand why with the  exact same settings I got different results. In particular at weekends. It turns out the reason for this is that the stored price data contains no spread information. During testing the tester uses the current spread even though you may be running your test on say data from January. This can be a real problem if you run your tests over the weekend where the markets are closed and the spread is much higher than it would be during normal market hours. Ultimately it will depnd on how sensitive the EA under test is to spread variations.

I have seen the spread on GBPUSD at 28 over one weekend with Alpari, you

can imagine what my test results came out like, I thought I had gone mad!

wow! this table is great and maybe the reason why my results look abit skewed!

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5702357/Stra...10-May2010.gif
Full details here

the wins are nice...very nice...but one or two losses and it wipes you out! this doesn't look like the charts i've seen on this forum...so hopefully the offset is my issue. i did ring my broker and he told me it was +1. i'm using FXCM Australia. so from the table, i assume i should be using -4 ???

as a sanity check if anyone out there knows how to calculate this easily:

- my current time: 10:30pm (timezone +10)

- metatrader marketwatch time: 1:30pm

- greenwich mean time: 12:30pm (as per http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com )

i think my offset should be +1, right?

If your broker time is 13:30 and GMT is 12:30 your GMT offset is +1.

Here is the latest version of the EA completely re-writtin by piptician  with

many new features, please see post #1 on the other thread:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650

From now on only one version of the EA is supported and all information

can be found on the other thread.

To run the EA, download the .ex4 file, place it in the Experts folder   and re-start MT4.

Crogram Files/MetaTrader/experts

Download the presets.zip file and unzip it on your desktop then move all   the .set files to:

Crogram  Files/MetaTrader/experts/presets

Attach the EA to  the chart and press the Load button on the settings

dialog that pops up and select the appropriate .set file for 1, 2 or 3  orders.

The only setting you need to change is the GMT offset for your broker.

I have been testing the EA on various times. 1-Jan-2010 to 1-Jun-2010. The attached chart displays my results on GbpUsd 1hr. (GoTrader Live account)
3 Order GbpUsd TesterGraph.gif

The second graph displays the 'reponse' to different time frames. I think I may find a tune for at least 2 hourly time frames. Clearly, one or 2 time frames stand out. This result is different between different brokers, but can be fine tuned for each.

So far I have also tested several currencies, with no result matching GbpUsd. However, I think there is some potential there.

3Order Hour GbpUsd TesterGraph.gif

Geoff, what is your view on this?

--- 帖子 #939 ---
The only problem I can see is that the EA as it stands looks to the slope of

the two SMA's in the previous 2 1H bars only.

In some cases you might want to look at a reversal of the trend or at the

slope over a longer period, there are many variations but, I think there is

only GBP pairs that have the necessary volatility.

When I first noticed how the trend continued, I was only looking at a very

small period of time to establish the trend and the EA merely confirmed that

what I had noticed was a valid strategy.

I am sure there are other similar trend continuations or reversals that could

be used but one is quite enough for me, it has been a hectic time just

developing one EA!

All thanks should go to piptician for his excellent work!

Not all!

Thanks Geoffb65.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Why the name change to tokyo?  I love VS 8 thus so far.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Just to indicate that this is a completely different EA from the older ones!

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Into 3 buy orders live with Tokyo - any one else??

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Can you show your chart please, the EA should not have traded today!

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Here you go. I have just closed all trades for a small profit and have binned it now. I have the gmt set to 3 so this is right. Just not happy with the risk reward on this boy anymore + every one is getting different results.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
I haven't had an order triggered yet on FXDD demo. I have had time to play around with some of the variables. Not to curve fit it for this year but to find the sweet spot in the numbers. I will post this in the other thread since we are all moving over there.

--- 帖子 #949 ---
camvcooV5 traded today, 2 closed in profit and the 3rd one is still hovering around in positive..
GoMarkets GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #950 ---
3 TP on both Alpari and FXpro, though the second broker had a better entry point and collected more pips. Funny how the third trade stop loss resisted for a few pips.

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Good result either way!!

--- 帖子 #952 ---
hi geoffb65,

yr EA seem very interesting.i have a question here,if i am currently using avafx as my broker and iam staying in malaysia,what should i set in GMT offset,is it 8?and how about start time?is it using 23? it is appreciate if you can help in this,thanks and happy trading

--- 帖子 #953 ---
You need to find out for sure your broker to GMT offset, if it is +8 then put

that in the GMToffset setting then you can leave Start time as 23.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Hello everyone I am still having trouble getting EA to work.

I have been trading for 3 years now and have never used an EA, so this is new to me.

I have read the whole thread and this is what I am getting in my expert journal after loading ea;

2010.06.10 18:31:28 TOKYO_H1GBPUSD_EA GBPUSDm,H1: initialized

The only thing I changed was time to ( 0 ) GMT for IBFX broker.

It says loaded successful and I have the smiling face.

But in red in bold letters on the USDGBP Chart : it says;

i tried loading chart but with out luck sorry.

Geoff it sounds like you have a great thread and EA going here, keep up the good work.   thankyou for all your help

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Weird. I found this morning two open longs on Alpari and three open longs on FXpro. All positions are negative for now, not sure if this entry turns to be profitable. Let's hope cable will push another bit up.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
Well first trade TP and the others stopped out. I just can't understand why Alpari had 2 trades while FXpro got 3.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Try setting GBPUSD_ONLY=false, you account uses GBPUSDm which is causing a problem, there will be a new issue of the software soon to allow for suffixes after the GBPUSD symbol.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Was there anything in the journal?

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Yes, I found a requote on Alpari. Maybe that's why I missed one trade, though it seems strange to have such things during the night.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Maybe it's time to change your magic number, they may have spotted you!

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Good call, I guess I have to change it every week.

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Hi Geoff,

Sorry for my ignorance. does that mean the brokers' don't allow any EA to run?

Regards

Velli

--- 帖子 #963 ---
They allow them to run but I'm sure they also analyse where their money is

going and it would be easy enough to see if lots of people with the same

magic number were taking profits regularly.

I don't know if this is true or just some people being paranoid but it's easy

enough to change the magic number occasionally to be on the safe side!

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Geoff, I noticed the other EA had evolved more than this one.

Do you suggest to switch over to the Tokyo EA?

--- 帖子 #965 ---
what u have test in real accounts ?

waiting result real accounts :d

Thanks

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Definitely!

I will close this thread quite soon, the Tokyo EA does everything now!

--- 帖子 #967 ---
I changed the GBPUSD to false to see if that works.

Also with the EA running I can't log out of the account to switch to another account or the EA will stop running, right?  Do I need to download a whole new platform from the same broker or do I have to use to use another broker if I want to play with another account and keep the EA working.

How long does the EA look for a trade after GMT. I was wondering when I needed to have my account running so i dont miss a trade.

One more thing, since I loaded the EA I keep hearing a ring going off on my computer every once in a while. Is that part of the EA.

Thankyou for all your help

bob

--- 帖子 #968 ---
With the EA running in one chart you can open another chart with the same or

different pair and the EA will continue so long as you keep your platform running.

There are no audio alarms in the EA but MT4 makes sounds occasionally.

The EA only looks for trades during the 23:00 GMT candle.

Today, only the 1 order option placed a trade the 2 & 3 order options did not!

--- 帖子 #969 ---
so if go from one demo account to another only the one that is open will trade, am i correct.

I have been trading for a while , but new to EAs

--- 帖子 #970 ---
hi Guys, Need help to install the EA to my MT4 can u guys teach me how?

--- 帖子 #971 ---
If you keep the platform open with the EA on it, it will continue, but if you

log out of the demo account to load a different account the EA will stop.

If you have another demo account on another platform you can keep both open

so the EA can continue trading!

--- 帖子 #972 ---
I spent an hour writing these instructions on the other thread!

--- 帖子 #973 ---
thks so much.谢谢!

--- 帖子 #974 ---
any reason you are using v7 on performance page v newest updates?

--- 帖子 #975 ---
The performance page title is fixed and I started it with v7 then v8 and v9 but

it is now Tokyo 2 order option actually!

The basic strategy is still the same so I decided to just continue with it!

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Hi geoffb65,

Why the EA take a trade the 04/06/2010 on forward testing (2) and not on backtesting (1) ?

Same settings:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thx,

--- 帖子 #977 ---
I don't know!

See the statement in my signature, my account with Alpari didn't trade either!

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Is EAv7 = CAMVCVOOV5 ?

--- 帖子 #979 ---
No, they are similar!

Tokyo_GBPUSD_H1_v11, on the other thread, using the 3 order .set file is the same.

--- 帖子 #980 ---
toyko v11 just took 3 longs at 4796.

Well i know the EA is working and doing well.

Also when i  look at a different timeframe like daily or 5 min, i get the red error on GBPUSD.  So i was wondering if i'm on a different time frame than the 1 hour does the EA stop working.

--- 帖子 #981 ---
The EA only works on GBPUSD H1 chart it will abort if you put it on the wrong time frame!

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Still no losing trades. Traded 9 days in June so far. Alpari UK.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
You sure Geoff? I know you said not to use it on anything else but I tried it on a few others over the last couple of days. Good work.

Edit: I see you were just talking about time frame and not pairs.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
That's very impressive! Don't tell everybody!

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Yeah, we'll just keep it to ourselves, eh!

--- 帖子 #986 ---
While you are keeping this information between you and Geoff please let us know what versions you used of the EA. Was it the Tokyo or one of the others? Thanks. Most impressive

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Hi.. Please share .SET file .

Thanks!

well done!

--- 帖子 #988 ---
6 posts above and default answers both.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Got it. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Utilizing the camvcvoo2a, Demo Account, I have had four days of trading on the Forex.com platform with 12 winners. The first three winners went all the way, +22, +50, +80. All the others made the +22 first contract and were stopped out at +10 or thereabouts and +1 or + 2, for the other two  contracts.  Going live on ATC next Monday.  See if the results differ!

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Watching your progress closely. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Hi all,

Curious, I have two accounts live with the CamV EA and the TOKYO version.

I get the following errors w/ the CamV version EA:

Any ideas?

Tokyo version is working OK...  Not all levels are getting opened up.  On demo, NO PROBLEM at all, but live on IBFX and FOREX.COM not so good.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
i believe Geoff is kinda fazing this thread out and is focusing on the simple H1 thread

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Tokyo version did this tonight too. Probably the order management code is the same. In original thread I wrote bug report.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Hi all,

I'm using V5 on a live account since one month, only good trades!

but yesterday and today there is "invalid ticket for order modify option" message in the expert tab!

Good work Geoffb65.

I'm new here, and I'll put my five star vote a.s.a.p.

Sorry for my bad english!

Thanks

Hi Geoff

I find this EA is really really really cool  when I test it on my alpari demo account. There is a question: If I use a pro account MT4 of alpari, does the EA work normally? Alpari sometimes gives me surprises

sherry

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Sorry,I forget another problem. That's, what time is the first time the EA works every week? GMT 21:00 Sunday?? Tokyo time 06:00 Monday??

Too many problems Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Alpari demo accounts are based on their Pro account (ECN/STP) so the EA

should work very well with an Alpari Pro account but the big problem is the

minimum lot-size at $30 per pip!

Set the GMT offset to 2 and leave the Start Time at 23 and it will trade

on Sunday night/Monday morning.

This will show up on the Alpari chart as a start time of 1:00 am which is correct.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
geoff from what time to time did you optimize it?

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
geoff from what date to date did you optimize it?

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
I usually optimise it for the past 12 months only!

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Hi geoff

What can I do if I want to cancel the third order?? Only change the third TP=0??

Thanks a lot

Sherry

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Go here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650

Changeing the TP to 0 will mean that you stand a risk of a -140 SL for a +0 (BE) gain...

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
Trailing stop don't work for 1 position order.

When it set 1 order lot, take profit 2000 and trailing to 9 it do this (47 pip profit, vcvoo v3 and v5)

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Thanks dam~I will choose tokyo ex4 and its order2.

Sherry

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
There is no TSL on 1 order. It's all or nothing.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Just vote 5 stars ... Good work Geoff ... Trying on real account now ...

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Many thanks for the star rating!

We are now using Tokyo v17a instead of the camvcvoo versions:

Thank you very much geoffb65  ,for  providing this EA .

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Hi Everyone,

I can't do the great result that you have. My backtest of v5 is very poor... GBPUSD H1. The broker is FXDD +3. Standard settings...

http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/820/31831409.jpg/

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
what are you doing here ... this thread isn't used anymore ! Look into the other "geoffb65" thread !!!

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
How about FXCM MT4 GMT offset and what is the Start Time should be apply ?

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
Geoffb65,

thank you for this thread and the EA. Just finished reading and will start using it next week. kindly explain this "Tesla - The greatest man ever!" for my better understanding

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
Sorry for the silly question but how can i change the time inthe oanda metatrader 4 to adjust it to the 23gmt thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
Why is it when I download this EA in the first page, and load it under the signals tabs it shows a loss with someone names Francis Osorio0. Anyone know anything of this???? Am I doing something wrong? Will I still be able to execute my trade?

forexvegan

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
i will test your EA, thank you

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
did you test the ea. Any good

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to post this. I'm going to give it a go from next week.

I've been doing a backtest of the EA and it's placing orders of 0.1. Is there a way of changing it to 0.01? I've changed it to this figure in the 'lot size' field and set 'manual lot size' to true, but I don't think that worked?

Edited: Did something happen to Geoffb65? I looked at his profile and it looks like he was ill?

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
hey guys i just tried to do a backtest with this ea but it doesn´t work, it doesn´t open any trades, what can be the reason for that?

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Nice EA!!

Please add on the timescale like below↓↓
