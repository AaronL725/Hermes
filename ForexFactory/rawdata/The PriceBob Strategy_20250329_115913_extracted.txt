This thread is different from other threads in that in order for someone really to remain up to speed on what's going on, he or she has to have watched the videos, at least the first video and then the most recent two or three. That means that this thread requires a larger commitment of time and effort than a traditional FF thread. It will not be for everyone. If you haven't taken the time to watch the videos and if you do not understand the rules of MeBob that define the set ups, please do not post charts and trading commentary to this thread. If you have an ego that needs to be fed, go eat elsewhere. This the central theme of this thread is the MeBob method found in post #2. If you are posting charts and trade commentary that is not MeBob compliant, take it to a trading discussion thread. This is a systems thread dedicated to a specific system. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Recently I was reintroduced to a strategy for day trading the S&amp;P 500 that originated over 30 years ago called "the MeBob Strategy." Soon after I started trading, I joined a trading room on a website called avidtraderDOTcom. I don't know why he closed his service, but at some point in the later 2000's Avidtrader shut down his trading room. There were many good traders there and quite a few hungry newbies like myself (Tom Hougaard, whom some of you know as TraderTom and is the author of the book Best Loser Wins was, at that time, one those hungry newbs!). One of the more experienced members went by the name MeBob. He came up with a method that was called, fittingly, the "Mebob Method," and it was based on the use of what he called a reference bar. The specific reference bar was the five-minute bar that opened at 10:05 AM Eastern and closed at 10:10 AM Eastern on the S&amp;P 500. The concept of having and using reference bars remained a part of my own search for my own method all these years. This thread exists because this past weekend I was "cleaning out" my gmail account (which is almost as old as my trading efforts) and I found an old email I sent to myself about the Mebob trading method. I then went looking for information online about MeBob the person to see if he might be active somewhere, and sadly what I found was his obituary. He passed away in 2023 just a few months short of his 88th birthday. I decided to create a "mebob" template in Ninjatrader, and after some cursory visual back testing, I decided that since I am usually done with my main trading instrument and method before or soon after the NYSE open each day, I'd explore the MeBob method, but I'd do so using price action concepts I've learned since those early days of my trading. These price action concepts I learned largely from studying Al Brooks and Bob Volman, and I take no credit for either MeBob, or the price action concepts I'll be using as I explore this hybrid of the two, which I rather uncreatively call "the PriceBob Method." @bluesteele found a Tom Hougaard document online in which TraderTom preserved some elements of the original MeBob Method. You can read and download that document at this link (the MeBob discussion is on pages 28 - 41): Avid Trader Tribute.docx I will post a copy of the original MeBob rules in the next post to this thread. I will be adopting and adapting the MeBob reference bar to a more price action oriented approach of entering and managing trades: Hence, "The PriceBob Method." I intend to make an effort, at least for the next few weeks, to record live trading of the ES using this hybrid method. The method itslef is a "work-in-progress." I welcome others to post and share their own attempts to incorprate the MeBob method into their own trading. For the record, I am not an "anti indicator" trader. However, in keeping with the spirit of the original MeBob method and its creator, I ask that you refrain from adding MA's, oscillators, and other derivitive squiggly lines to your charts in this thread. The focus should be on using the MeBob reference bar and price action itself to identify and manage trades. I thank you all in advance for keeping the MeBob spirit alive! Here is a video I made where I introduce both how to identify the MeBob reference bar and also attempt to show some of the price action concepts I intend to use with the PriceBob method.

Below I have copied and pasted the original MeBob rules as found in the Tom Hougaard document referenced in the above post. Please note the following: The method I will be trading is NOT the original MeBob method. Therefore, when you read my posts, see my chart screenshots, and watch my trading videos, you will see that I am often taking trades NOT in strict accordance with the following rules. Also, you will see where someone, perhaps TraderTom, perhaps MeBob himself suggests "doubling up" when you stop out of one trade and reverse to a trade in the opposite direction. In my opinion, this is a recipe for blowing up your account, and I do not advocate such an approach to money management. I post the following only in the interest of maintaining an historic reference to the original MeBob rules as very little can be found about this method on the internet. Here is a link to the obituary of Robert Falk, the creator of the original MeBob method: Obituary information for Robert Harold Falk What follows was copied and pasted from Tom Hougaard's document and I am not responsible for its content or composition: https://www.tradertom.com/wp-content...ute.docx-1.pdf Another poster was MEBOB. I have been informed his real name is Rob Falk. He had a set of mechanical rules, which was often the topic of conversation on the Avid chat. Here is the introduction to the rules: 1. You trade it on the SP500 Index. 2. You use a 5-min chart. 3. You only use it during Regular trading hours only (09:30am – 16:00pm Eastern Standard time). A more detailed explanation follows below: 1. The US stock market index opens at 09:30am New York local time. 2. The 5-min reference bar to wait for is the 10:05am–10:10am bar. 3. This is the 8th 5min bar into the regular trading session. 4. Observe the high and the low of the reference bar. 5. Draw a horizontal line through the high of the reference bar. 6. Draw a horizontal line through the low of the reference bar. 7. If the SP500 closes above the high of the reference bar “highest line”, it is a BUY signal. 8. If the SP500 closes below the low of the reference bar “lowest line”, it is a SELL SHORT signal. 9. The stop loss is placed either at the most recent swing or above/below the reference bar. It is a simple method. Here is what Oleman thought of it: “The seemingly erratic performance of the "MeBob" (trading rule) is simply what one would expect from a trend following system. Bob, who has a lot of good stuff, was simply giving the newbies a "Trigger" to get them into day trades at good times.” I have added a rule, which is also discussed in the Avid chats. Where my stop loss is, I will double up in the opposite direction. If I am long at 10, and I have a stop at 6, then I will also at 6 have a short position waiting, which is twice as big as the original long position. I will now post the outcome of the MEBOB reference bar from the last 9 consecutive trading days. I am not hand-picking good days. I want you to see for yourself the value of the signal. Like all mechanical signals, it probably has a hit rate around 55-60. I think you will agree with me when I say that there are some good signals and there are some hit-and-miss signals. What else can you expect from a mechanical system like a fixed time bar method?

Here is the video of today's trading. My first trade was placed in a fresh prop evaluation account that requires $3000 in profits to pass and has an end of day trailing drawdown of $2000. Once I hit a full winner on that account, I decided to switch to a SIM account as this particular prop firm has rather strict rules on consistency and requires more trading days in the eval stage than most. The name of the prop firm is not relevant as I am not an affiliate and I have no commerical interests. My goal has always been and will remain to make money from trading, not "vendoring" or affiliating. I had some difficulty with my mouse in Ninjatrader which has been something of a recurring problem but today was the first time it really affected my ability to manage my trades. I will uninstall and reinstall Ninjatrader this afternoon and I hope that resolves the issue. Here is the link to the video: Inserted Video

I think the one key, if not the key element that the mebob can contribute to defining an edge is that it provides what Linda Raschke calls a "reference point" "Watching price action can actually be very confusing if you go about it like a ship without her sails up in an ocean squall. You will get tossed back and forth with no sense of direction and no sense of purpose. There are two main tricks to monitoring price action. The first is to watch the price relative to another "reference point." This is why many traders use a "pivot point" - and it works! It is the easiest way to tell if the market is moving closer to or further away from a particular point. This is also why it is often easier to get a "feel" for the market once you put a position on - your "reference" point tends to be your entry price." You can read her entire article here: Tape Reading, by Linda Bradford Raschke | Forex Factory

I completely agree that having a reference point is fundamental in navigating market price action. A single point of reference can provide enough context to establish a meaningful perspective, much like key levels do. What I particularly appreciate about your approach is that it encourages traders to analyze these levels from multiple vantage points. When various reference points—whether pivot levels, prior highs/lows, or other structural markers—are considered together, they begin to form a more comprehensive picture of market behavior. This layered perspective is what enables traders to extract opportunities with greater confidence. After all, no one wants to believe the market is purely random. Perhaps it is, perhaps it isn’t—but having clearly defined reference points allows traders to move with intention rather than uncertainty, much like a vessel navigating with a visible horizon rather than drifting aimlessly in open water.

Excellent post, Machine! Price action is probably at its most random at the HFT level of granularity, right? I mean, from tick to tick anything truly can happen. The spread is the spread and it can fluctuate from moment to moment as to what is the best bid and what is the best offer at that very moment in time. But I think as we zoom out and take in that larger perspective of which you speak, the randomness dissipates somewhat. There seems to be, for instance, a point at which a previous day's low becomes an almost irresistible price magnet, and the market can't resist its gravitational pull until enough sellers become buyers to allow price once again to rise. I don't mean to imply that I believe in "sure things" when it comes to trading. Only that there is likely significantly less "randomness" than many would seem to believe.

interesting

In this video, I review today's price action in and around the MeBob range, and explain how I believe a trader using the original MeBob entry rules might have traded using MeBob today. Inserted Video I believe that a key difficulty to the MeBob method strictly applied is the question of risk/reward. Where should we place our stop? Where should we take our profits? I'd love to hear your ideas about money management and MeBob!

It looks like you marked a wrong candle

--- 帖子 #13 ---
BD is right Machine. The MeBob bar is the M5 bar that opens at 10:05 Eastern and closes at 10:10 Eastern. You are marking the bar that opens at 10:10 AM and closes at 10:15. You are one bar late today.

I thought something was up! The broker feed I'm using on TradingView is being super weird, not entirely sure what's going on. I'm switching brokers and it's showing different bars. Probably something I'm not noticing on my end. Even yesterday when I was watching the bars, it was like 10:10 and the candles were appearing on the 10:20 line, I was so confused. Here's the candle..

Hi MachineL, I never trade us500 before. I always traded gold. And it's been nearly 7/8 years. May I know which platform or broker is good for trade us500 , easy execution and less spread issue.

VidVad would know better, I've been a CFD and Forex trader for most my years. I've been using PLUS500 as the broker for trades and it's been pretty good so far. I know a lot of people recommend tradovate.

I use Ninjatrader Brokerage. You can also trade with various prop firms. I'd suggest TopStep as the best combination of low cost and clear rules and reliable payouts. Avoid Apex like your life depends upon avoiding it. TradeDay is also good, but costs a little more. If you choose TradeDay, I'd reccomend you select an account with an End of Day drawdown, not the intraday drawdown. A lot of FF traders who trade futures also seem to use AMP Futures. Turnip15 is in the UK, and he might be able to make some recommendations as well if you are not located in the USA.

Hi, i did a visual test from february till now (03.02.-06.03.) with following rules: breake high/low of 15:05 candle -&gt; trade entry SL= high/low of candle 15:05 TP= 1:2 RRR Optional: Revers with same rules, when trade hit SL 24 trades / 8 Win / 16 Loss Result: 0 (not taken into account spread or anything else) Reverse 16 trades /8 Win / 8 Loss Result: 4R Remarks: without optimization, it is purely a game of chance (with the rules i have listet). I think price action methods are more importend for this system. Of course, these are just my personal thoughts . Keep on the good work Vidvad

Thank you for your effort in doing this work and sharing with us here. This is exactly the type of work that needs to be done. The purpose of the thread is to explore the value of incorporating or even building a trading plan around the concept of a fixed bar strategy, and in particular, the mebob bar. Let's do a quick debrief of your test so we are all on the same page. It will be important to note what rules you used and how these rules differ from the original MeBob rules and also differ from the money management rules I proposed in my review video of yesterday's price action. So you used a break of the high to enter long and a break of the low to go short. This is certainly one tactic for entering a position available to us. I haven't ruled it out myself as further testing is needed. Your rule differs from the original MeBob method in that a break is necessary to prompt a signal, but it is not sufficient. In order to trigger a trade entry according to the original rules, price needs to break and close above the high to enter a long, and break and close below the low to enter a short. This is an extremely important distinction. Your sample size of 24 trades would no doubt be reduced if you were to apply this criteria to your sample size of days. This is the exact same stop loss as the original MeBob method uses. For my own review yesterday, I applied this rule as well as I wass conducting the review using the original MeBob rules for entry and stop loss. The 1:2 risk reward I presume means your take profit was set to a level twice the risk, and the risk, of course, is the range of the MeBob bar. This really lays bare the importance of money management. In my review, using the original MeBob entry and stop loss rules, I added the following Take Profit rule: On the first close above/below the MeBob bar, target a profit equal to the MeBob bar range. On any subsequent entries triggered by retracements to the MeBob range, target the most recent high - 8 ticks for long trades, and the most recent low +8 ticks for short trades. I suspect that the 1:2 risk to reward is not going to test out to be the proper money management approach for a straight MeBob breakout system. Also, in your rules where you state "Optional: Reverse with the same rules," it is important for us to acknowledge that it seems as though the comments about reversing and "doubling up" where Tom Hougaard's creation and were not part of the Rob Falks's original MeBob method rules. It is interesting, however, that in your data set the addition of the reverse when stop loss is hit actually resulted in improving your rule set from essentially breakeven to a +4R before spread, fees, etc. Using your rules on yesterday's data, there would have been a -1R trade long (-16 points), and a +2R (+32 points) trade short, for a +1R (+16 point) profit on the day. When I applied my money management rules, where 1R = 16 points as well, the final result was four trades of +16, +11.50, +13, and +16 = +56.50 points, or +3.53R What this shows is that whatever value the use of the MeBob as a fixed bar reference will require a money management plan appropriate to the extent one can generally expect price to move when it exits and closes outside of the MeBob range. I really appreciate what you've shared here, FX-F. Unlike other systems threads where there is supposedly a fully formed system for others to "plug and play" in the first post, this is an exploration thread, and you have certainly added an important data sample to the project! If you haven't already watched it, you can view the review video here which shows a money management plan different from the 1:2 that you used, and also used the more restrictive trade entry criteria of the original MeBob method rules.

Here is the review of today's MeBob method set ups. Today gave Mebob traders four set ups for trades, one short, and three long, and it was 4/4. For someone trading just one emini, that was a potential profit of $2000 in one day using the money management rules I established for the initial test phase of the MeBob method! I tried cleaning up my mic a bit. I know the sound is sometimes muffled and it sounds like I have marbles in my mouth. I think I was able to correct for most of sound difficulties. Inserted Video

Nice video! One discretional trade in there however, but even if you took that trade for the loss youd still have a great day. I want to incorporate some orderflow to help contextualize those whipsaw days that we've been fortunate to not see lately.

Which one to you feel was discretion based rather than rule based, Machine?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
A short trade after the push back up to the MEBOB. Bearish Candle closed slightly under

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Let's see where it takes us! One thing I'd note that I didn't mention in the video tonight is that the reason I added ATR to the chart is that ATR may be a better tool to use for setting take profit levels. Right now, I am going to +10 points, but that is because the current daily ranges are huge. Three months ago if you went for +10 points you'd have taken a lot of losses. But if instead you went for +4 points you'd have a lot of wins. As ATR grows, so too will the profit target. As ATR contracts, likewise will the profit target. So a +40 point day is great. But when volatility contracts to normal levels, whenever that may be, then a four win day might be +16 points. And that too will be a great day. I want to focus for one more week on the price action in and around the MeBob range. However, I think adding some Al Brooks/Bob Volman price action set ups will make the whole plane stronger and probably more consistent over time. I need to do more extensive back testing. I can't shake the feeling that this week is something of a positive expectancy outlier. Time will tell. Welcome aboard!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
That's the one where it closed 1 tick below but after reclaiming the previous day's close?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Yeah, technically a trade no? Albeit outside of your discretional rule set.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
In the video, I explained I would not take it because it was basically a close on the previous settlement level, after a strong rally back to turn the day from red to green. I'd want a strong bear signal bar there before taking a short. But, strictly speaking, I agree with you that it technically would be a trade per the original MeBob rule set. From what I remember of MeBob (and keep in my memory of his posts is nearly 20 years old at this point) I think he'd say you can't short against the previous day's close in that particular context. But since cannot ask him, we have to judge for ourselves. If that bar had closed at or near its low I'd have called it a short entry. But it really is something of a doji: large upper wick, large lower wick, body is small relative to the candle size, and closed ABOVE the previous day's close by 1 tick, even though below mebob by 1 tick. It was between a rock and a hard place as the saying goes. It is going to be one of those (hopefully) rare instances where two of us trading the mebob rules could make opposite decisions, one staying flat, the other going short, and we'd both be right, you know?

hey vidvad....I used to be at avidtrader 25 years ago I think the tards like samurai and dirgo made it tough on liberal traders so we slowly kept leaving till there was no one to chat and the site was sold to some fascist wannabe who tried making it a club for conservatives....anyone of the liberal or libertarian persuasion wasn't welcome. i know humble1 and others went to silicon investor ...i think H1 is still there doing his "counting" https://www.siliconinvestor.com/subj...ubjectid=57872 you have to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page to see his current posts I miss the price action trading of people like twocents and G9...he had the best intraday timing system with humble1 having a good daily one. tom drake who was twocents had that 2CS sentimeter which I followed ...he started a blog for awhile during the upheavals but alas I think he passed away too....most of those people were seniors 20-25 years ago so many prolly dead now ;( https://twocents.blogs.com/weblog/2020/05/index.html I learned about the kondratieff wave from 2C oh and chris carolan with his spiral calender....all them guys were great till the place started descending into a fascist circlejerk towards the end speaking of price action trading you'll have to stress to the newbies that that isn't the same as ICT price action cause they all think price action just means no indicators LOL well good luck with this thread...you brought back some fond and disturbing memories about avidtrader LOL hugh blanton is a author now who writes poems..tepid2 was one of the reasons avid folded and then he went to work for topstep and last I heard died from that hepatitis he caught in his youth some people went to irc channels like myself...daytraders on othernet closed down and there's just one left called activetrader on financialchat server....still just stocks and futures trading ...stop by if you want to argue politics afterhours with people LOL discord is the new thing now I guess for the seniors who don't know what the hell that is LOL

That is exactly why I stated in the initial post that this thread is going to explore a hybrid of the mebob method and price action. For me, I have always felt Richard Wyckoff's understanding was the best definition of trading price action: Trading pure price action, aka "Tape Reading" is the art of forecasting (not predicting) where price is likely to move next by judging the action of the market itself. (And I refer here to the actual human being, the Richard D Wyckoff and not all the trading vendors who have attempted to profit by using his name).

My first futures account was with the old Lind-Waldock sometime around 1998. I wasn't day trading at the time. I was swing trading gold when it was less than$300/ounce and crude oil was trading between $10 and $12/barrel lol. I didn't day trade the ES for the first time until 2005 or 2006, which is why I didn't find avidtrader until it was near the end of the website. I think it was Richard Dennis, or perhaps his partner William Eckhardt who said they could publish the rules to their trading system in the Wall Street Journal and no one would follow them correctly. Everyone (and I include myself here of course) always wants to refine away the losing trades completely, and so any profitable trading system is quickly amended and changed by anyone who comes by it second hand. It is this very tendency that has caused the degree of consistency and success I have long sought for in trading to elude me for as long as it has (or is it now, "had?").

I miss hard copy magazines. First of all simply for the experience of holding the magazine while reading it, and turning the pages. But also they were a filter between good and poor content. The internet is so cheap and easy to use to deliver information that 99.9% of the information on it would have died before reaching the public in the age of print media. ( I mean, just look at me: Any bozo can record a video and post it to youtube these days lol) That's why you have to go back at least ten years, probably 13 years or more to find the best content from TAS&amp;C and other trading magazines.

Heres a few days that price's behaviour around Mebob got my attention. Truth be told one can draw any random line and see price revolve around it. These are simply observations. As for visually going thru history one just needs a Breakout indicator as I know many here use MT4 or 5 .... Just a quick thought If I were so inclined..One of the things that I would be looking at is days of the week and Mebob. Are there any days of the week that show a higher probability of say a BO of Mebob levels that dont return... Thinking along the lines of Mebob and how it is purported to be used for "catching" a trend trade.. Days of the week is just one idea... Perhaps someone uses Edgeful and can plug the Mebob time in and spit some data out.

Imo, the money management is trader's choice on MeBob. If someone wants to target +2 points that's his choice. If someone want to target 1:1 measuring to the failed breakout high as fream1 did, that too is a valid choice. The most important part of any trading plan, assuming a positive expectancy edge exists, is does the trader feel comfportable with the stop loss risk and the reward hoping to be offered. BTW, new MeBob short at the close of the 11:40 candle.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
You are right, seeing so many rejections from above, I opted for the option of using those zones as stop loss.

Second MeBob short another +10 profit. I didn't record it, but it will be included in tonight's MeBob review video.

I agree 100%, just want to make sure he knew he didn't have to use 1:1 with top of MB range, not saying what he did was wrong!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
The old floppy disk in my head has being whirring and clicking away.... Why? Well if I could understand why me Bob chose that particular candle... Then perhaps it would shed some light on further ideas of capturing the trend or a larger move.. First and foremost in my head is 10:00 a.m. is not only the hourly rotation but it's the 4-Hour rotation.. So perhaps I may look at the 4-Hour chart with some very simple technicals... In the spirit of always keeping things simple. My other thought perhaps he's using first 30 minutes of the equity open as an opening range. 930-10 and simply the 10:05 is the setup.. perhaps he had a bias from that first 30 minutes.... Again just spitballing some ideas out there. Cheers

--- 帖子 #65 ---
If I had to guess the logic behind that choice of candle it would be this: 10 AM is the opening 30 minute range. 20+ years ago, that was a very popular range amongst all traders, retail and institutions, and it remains a favorite of institutions today. By waiting for 10 minutes after the close of the 30 minute opening range, it allowed for brekaout and failed breakout of that range to settle. The assumption MeBob probably used was that after the first breakout attempt, the next move would likely be sustained. So it was a way of not getting chopped by a failed breakout, as well as a good time to catch what could be a swing lasting an hour or two. Back in those days of the 1990's and early 2000's day traders, catching swings, or at least, trying to catch and ride swings, was popular as recall.

If you are a new trader or a veteran struggling with consistency, fighting the demons of FOMO and over trading, watch this video: Inserted Video Then watch this video: Inserted Video Then use the information in the first to complete the exercise in the second. Do it for 20 trading days. During that time, do not worry about profits and losses. Just do the exercise. Use a SIM account, or if you insist on trading live, use micro contracts. Do this for 20 trading days and you will likely put most of your trading demons behind you and be well on your way to becoming a consistently profitable trader.

Well - a chart for SP500 and Nasdaq. Seems Nas might offer more bang per buck ?

My head hurts too But I keep reading and testing after trading

--- 帖子 #69 ---
In my opinion, it's simple. By the 8th 5-minute bar, the market has moved past the initial volatility of the opening bell and the immediate reaction to economic news or overnight sentiment. The market begins establishing a directional bias after the first half-hour of trading, and this bar captures that transition You can see just from simple volume that one bar before the MB setup candle, volume was equal to the highest it's been all day, and after this candle the volume is not even close. Basically, the most liquid and volatile part of the day is over, and the first five or so minutes proceeding this part of the day can create a logical zone traders can use to gauge market direction.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
How have you/will you determine that this strategy has a positive expectancy edge?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Forward testing with live trades in the live market now. Probably need about 100 days of data to be sure. The lone variable for me with respect to money management is that the take profit most likely will best be determined through an ATR function. This thread is a systems thread, but it is a shared work-in-progress. The strategy was created by a trader back in the 1990's who recently passed away. So while we have his rules, we don't know what his data looked like, not if his view of the method changed over the course of the past 30 years.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Have you watched the live trading videos? I'm using the original MeBob entry rules, stop loss rule, and currently a 10 point take profit. The problem with a multi year backtest at this time is I'm still working on a proper ATR function for the take profit. 10 points is great for now. A month ago, 4 or 5 points would have been more appropriate.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I watched a bit of one video but the voice changer stuff put me off a bit to be honest. As for backtesting I feel like I'd start with the backtesting to try and work out these parameters and how they should be adjusted to different market conditions and then proceed with the live forward test, even if it needed to be adjusted later.

Nightly MeBob trade signal review video: Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #66 ---
On a day like today there would be 5 or 6 -1R losses before the first orthodox signal. Another FF member did a one month backtest similar to yours, with more or less breakeven results. Rob Falk was a pretty smart guy and a long time trader. I'm certain that he had good reason to design the system with entries triggered only after a close beyond the MeBob range high or low.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I'd refer you to the two videos in this post. I mean no disrespect when I say that you aren't grasping the spirit of what is going on here. I'm trying to help people get off the systems merry-go-round and focus on what will really lead them to be consistently profitable traders. Forward testing is the way forward. https://The PriceBob Strategy | Page 4 | Forex Factory The real challenge is not in the strategy. It's in our mind. I feel that if an FF member, whether a green pea newbie or a struggling and frustrated veteran, were to listen to those two videos, embrace the MeBob for 20 days and Mark Douglas's exercise, and follow along here in case we need to adjust the take profit, that those traders who do so will reach in one month (20 trading days is approximately one month) that carefree state of mind that eludes 99.9999999% of us. Back testing is the noise, forward testing the signal. For those who join the exploration in the spirit of the thread, epiphanies are incoming.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I should probably remind you that by your own admission you've not watched but a few minutes of one video that comprise the bulk of the content pertaining to the Mebob. Had you watched the videos then all these alleged criticisms you are throwing at me would not exist. How can you tell me I should have been clearer when you yourself admit you really don't care to know what's going on because you don't like the sound of my voice? lol I am not a "pusher" of any strategy. However, the intention of this thread is to explore whether this methodology, to wit, the MeBob Methodology , may add value to a pure price action methodology. We've not gotten there yet. We've not even begun to discuss the additional set ups of which MeBob will be playing a supporting role. The commitment to this thread as I stated in the videos is to stick to the MeBob through this week. In the course of this initial phase, it occurred to me that this method is very well suited as a reasonable choice for someone wishing to complete Mark Douglas's exercise. Had you had the courtesy to watch the videos you' d have known that. Again, all of this has been very clearly stated and explained in the videos. If you wish to understand this thread then I think you have to watch the videos. If you don't watch the videos, then we are going to have these communication breakdowns repeatedly. There is no easy button here. I've been doing the work for a long time. There is work to be done here, and work is being done here. But it is unfair of you to come here and not merely misjudge but to malign my clarity of purpose and question my intentions when you have refused to view the material where I make plain my thoughts on where we are and where we might be heading. You have been unable to recognize that this thread is different from the same old song and dance that has been customary on trading forums for decades. We are trying something different here. You should take the time to familiarize yourself with our process before thinking yourself qualified to publicly pick us apart as you are trying to do here. Again, I mean no disrespect (though I don't think you can say the same) when I say you've not even tried to grasp what's is going on here.

everybody now days wants to automate their trading using computers as quickly as possible so they can sit back and jerkoff all day while the machine makes em money that's why tooslow kicks people out of his thread that bring up EA's some people just cant be helped

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I would think the percentage of retail traders trying to make consistent profits with bots who are actually succeeding is far less than those who point and click their trades using the mouse. I can't tell you how many times I have had someone ask me "why don't you just automate your rules and have the computer trade for you." Those who ask don't understand than a significant portion of one's edge as a small account, rule-based point and click trader can be derived from maintaining physical real time control of one's operation. This thread is different from other threads in that in order for someone really to remain up to speed on what's going on, he or she has to have watched the videos, at least the first video in the initial post and then the most recent two or three. That means that this thread requires a larger commitment of time and effort than a traditional FF thread. It will not be for everyone. I'm going to try not to resort to the ignore feature to keep the thread on track. Going forward, I will have to make some effort to limit the participation of those who assume that what we are doing here is going through the motions of a typical FF systems thread, however.

Good morning traders. I feel like we're due for some choppiness around the MEBOB today. How well do you handle back to back losses? Does your management help combat these kind of days?

Nevermind, MEBOB strikes again for a nice winner

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I hit the market order entry late because I had a Ninjatrader windo open and that caused my first market order attempt to be rejected. As a result, I recived a more favorable order than I would have had I entered the moment the signal presented. However, as you will see when I post the live recording, I used the 10 point profit target measured from where I should have entered rather than where I did enter. As a result, my profit on this first MeBob trade of the day was +17.75 points.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
The whole thrust behind the Mark Douglas exercise and using a mechancial strategy such as MeBob is that you are learning to follow a process, and you simply accept the losing streaks as readily as you accept the losing streaks. When you said "I feel like we're due for ..." you must understand that that is a feeling particular to you. The market doesn't even know you exist, much less care how you feel. It is a form of the gambler's fallacy. "It has come up red 13 times in row. I feel black is due to come up now!" Beware of such thinking. You cannot take credit for the losses, and so long as you follow the rules, you may take no blame for the losses. Your job is to follow a process, not produce specific individual and independent results.

A good start for Mebob ( if i have drawn line correctly. Note meBob bar is wider but one quickly gained a decent 10 points plus?

MEBOB range definitely holds weight. Three 5 minutes candles respecting the range in a row, only for the breakout candle to lead to a decent move.

And MeBob high marked the final point of resistance to the rally attempt as well. Very small sample size (the thread is less than two weeks old) but so far, Rob Falk's MeBob has earned further consideration. The MeBob review this evening will have several points of interest that need to be examined, imo.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Fighting on daily low

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I posted this screenshot from Linda Raschke's Streetsmarts book in my journal a few weeks ago and it has relevance here. 1) MeBob is itself not an element of what is generally considered "technical analysis." The MeBob methodology is a precise set up that gets you into and out of the market quickly. It is a "surgical strike" methodology. 2) It is important initially to trade a new concept or patter on paper or with what Al Brooks calls the "Do Not Care" size. You must remove the psychological and emotional pressure of the possibility of losing money so that you can watch for and see the pattern over and over again so as to come to feel completely comfortable with it. 3) If MeBob doesn't make sense to you or you find yourself negatively disposed toward this type of method, don't trade it! If you don't have 100% confidence (and I would add "comfort") with the pattern, you will never be able to overcome the desire to abandon it during losing streaks. This is, imo, the key to the trading kingdom, and its realization is the heart of what in my journal I refer to as "the roulette epiphany." 4) All you need is one pattern to make a living day trading! That really is the ruth. I use one pattern on the NQ each day. Completely mechanical with zero discretion. That one pattern has made the past five months the most profitable of my trading career. That is in spite of the fact that I lost confidence in it temporarily as I was not prepared to muscle through its first losing streak. Thankfully, I did muscle through ultimately. One pattern is all you need. MeBob might be it for some of you! If it isn't, the exercise of trading MeBob, even in a sim account, for 20 days, is likely all you need to correct forever the habits of FOMO, over-trading, jumping the gun, etc. All the bad trading behaviors that lead almost always to big losses and blown accounts.

Rob Falk referred to the MeBob bar as a "reference bar. It provides a defined range of price by which one can measure the movement of price throughout the day. This section from Linda Raschke's eBook is, imo, of interest to us in that she too refers to the importance of "pivots" and points of reference.

Excellent content VidVad.. you're really highlighting some of the most important points of trading. How refreshing to see a thread here at FF.... That is not the same old song and dance. What's being shared here is far more than a mechanical method to trade the ES.. .. (combined with the roulette epiphany) And man oh man.. I sure love Linda Bradford Raschke ..

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) These were my two entries today in my demo account, my management is to use 0.5% per trade and limit myself to 2 entries in case the price retraces to the MB candle. I have a doubt, I see that at the moment the average movement in this strategy is 10 points, how much would those 10 points represent in pips? The same? It would be very helpful. Thank you very much to all of you

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Excellent thread. Well done vivvad for setting this up. I first came across this method through Tom Hougaard's website after trawling through the avid trader notes. Mechanical, rule based entries are what I like. Takes the mind out of the equation. I'm looking at other indices to see if there is any value in exploring other markets. I noted today that the range was strong resistance, but once broken, lead to a strong breakout. Maybe the reference zone forms some kind of daily reference zone/ area of interest. I'm sure in time as we trade it more we'll find a few worthy nuances.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Just add 10 points to your entry for a long, and subtract 10 points for a short. For example, if your entry price was short at 5565.2, then your profit target is 5565.2 - 10.00 = 5555.2

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I was considering the same. NQ performed well today too

--- 帖子 #103 ---
LBR is old school, and so are we and so is this thread! One effect the roulette epiphany had on me was that I immediately went to a method that was based just on M15 bars. And not only that, but the original roulette method was very much a fixed time bar method, and it remains nearly, though not entirely so. I shed the MA's, used no oscillators, and I even removed the pivots, temporarily. This was not an "anti-indicator" impulse, by any means. LBR herself is famous for her attachment to the 3/10 oscillator, keltner channels, and other popular indicators. It was more a desire on my part to "get back to basics" and to simplify the charts. I was for a time playing with the detrended oscillator, inspired by another excellent thread here at FF by IslandFX. But after a week or so, I removed that chart template from my workspeace. I am not anti-indicator. But I am much more interested in using price bars themselves to signal entries, and fixed time bar methods like MeBob .

Back to Basics... Muscle Memory As Linda Raschke said: ' All you need is one pattern to make a living.' Or Bruce Lee: 'I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.' Mebob 3/3 today 30 pts.

The nightly MeBob review. This one is worth watching in its entirety as there was an interesting piece of price action at the MeBob lows today after the first MeBob break, and while I was certain as it was happening that I wouldn't trade it as a MeBob entry, it really isn't as clear to me in terms of how to compose a rule that would let a new MeBobber readily recognize that that set up had consumed most of what could easonably have expected as far as hitting a fixed profit target. It is, imo, the first wrinkle the market has thrown me regarding MeBob. I'd love to hear what others think. Was it a proper MeBob set up? Was it not? Is vidvad smokin' crack again? Let me know what you think! Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #106 ---
It was a valid signal and don't think a rule is necessary. If your trading experience/skill/intuition can help you filter trades than power to you. You as a trader can carve some extra edge out of any system you use. However, I don't think we should start over fitting rules for every single market behavior. Chalk it up to experience, and as long as others stick to the rules they should be profitable with or without that experience, albeit maybe a little less.

How is the 18 bar range relative to the 8th bar range? In your opinion, what's the takeaway here

--- 帖子 #108 ---
All good statistics, but, imho, far from "all you need to know." These are statistics but not set ups. The MeBob methodology has nothing do with gaming the probability that a final HOD or LOD has been printed. As a student of Brooks myself, his statistics in these slides is indeed interesting, but one could nonetheless trade the MeBob method quite successfully without ever having these statistics brought to his attention. The value of the Mebob is it provides a reference range outside of the opening volatility and after 99% of post-open news dumps by which a trader can identify good times to enter, i.e. it provides set ups, not statistics. When it comes to Al Brooks, imo, if there is anything that is "all you need," it is in the 13 videos those compose his "Charting Analysis" section of the course. My favorite are these three: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #115 ---
of course it is not "all you need to know" haha. you never know enough, everyday we learn new stuff. im always open to new ideas

--- 帖子 #116 ---
The MeBob being the 8th bar of the NYSE session is really not akin to Al Brooks's bar counting, however. For Brooks, the essence of bar counting is not the statiticala probability that the market has seen either the high or low of the day by a certain bar. The essence of bar counting is to count the market's attempts to reverse back in the direction of a treend. High1, High 2 for longs, Low 1, Low 2 for shorts. Those are set ups. There is a huge difference between set ups and statistics. A complete newbie could come upon this thread and very quickly would be able to identify and trade MeBob set ups. I'm far from a newb, I've studied Brooks's course for years, and still review sections of it with some frequency, and I have no idea what you you're trying to show in terms of set ups when you say you were trading the 18 bar range only.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
More to the point, I do not see how Al's statistics regarding the first 18 bars provides any defined price action set ups. We are concerned with defining rule-based set ups that can be easily communicated to one another.

https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...8#post15171648 Hi Tommy, Many of us here are well aware of Al Brooks and the 18 bar probabilitys. Sort of Apples and Oranges tho. We all know there are many ways to trade the markets and my suggestion is always this if it's working for you...keep on doing it ! Congrats... But never discount others knowledge and experience as there is always something to learn from everyone Btw personally I love roadmap I've traded it for years as well as Al Brooks PA methods. I've developed an extensive playbook around those.... but..... VidVad has shared some excellent material here.. and a wise trader, whether new , seasoned, profitable or not ..No matter where you are on the trading journey...they would be savvy to pay attention to the finer details being shared... This is not only about the 8th bar....much much more is in play Thanks for your contribution and congrats on your Topstep account. keep up the good trading ! Cheers Blue

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I didn't mean to bash the 8th bar, sorry if it came off like that. I might have misunderstood with a few of the posts i read (just scrolling thru fast, mind you) and i think it was a discussion about backtesting it and how it was no point in doing any further, and i might have assumed something by there, and jumped to conclusions. Please forgive me. Fistbumps and hugs ? EDIT: Oh and i don't only trade the 18 bar range, i have many different tricks up my sleeve for different market situations, but the 18 bar range has proven, to me at least, to be very effective. I treat it just like a range, or a range BO. Those are all the rules i need, and some sort of confirmation, but im honestly very much a intuitive trader, i assess the price action relatively quick when i do, i know what to look for, i use roadmap very much to asses the direction of momentum, and i use different patterns to give me hints to the direction, but i have made a choice myself to NOT rely on too many rules, cause to me, it has been more of an issue rather than help with too many rules, but i always assess pro's and cons and find anything that might signal me otherwise, or hopefully just confirm my initial idea. and aside from that i often apply volume profiles, but mostly when i see large ranges at a likely top or bottom to easier help me catch the break out

I'm not sure what you're trying to prove here. I would suggest that you look at the charts you've posted here and ask yourself how in the world, while keeping a straight face, can you imply that mebob is somehow "overcomplicating" things compared to what you've posted? Look, I appreciate you wishing to contribute here. I think this thread has the potential to change lives. Man, I want everyone to read and participate in this thread. But I'd prefer if we all stayed on the same page rather than trying to post materials that seem to serve no purpose other than to draw attention to the one posting it. We had the same thing happen last night. I don't know what it is about FF that makes people want to insert non sequiturial tangents everywhere lol. I'd suggest you start a thread to explore and promote your ideas if you'd like. But it is rather uncouth to drop them as you have in a thread of this sort in an attempt to usurp the direction of the thread. I mean no ill will toward you. And again, I appreciate any and all participation here as it relates to the stated intent and subject matter of the thread. But I have to respond like this or else it will confuse the thread, confuse less experienced FF members, and lay waste to the efforts put into thus far. I know you didn't mean any harm. And again, I hold no ill will. If you wish to contribute specifically Brooks material, then I suggest you wait until we get there. Right now, "all you need to know" is found in post #1 and post #2 of this thread.

Well, that explains a lot lol. That back testing discussion introduced a bunch of garbage into the thread last night. And you know what they say, "garbage in, garbage out."

Good Morning. It is Wednesday March 12, 2025. If you haven't taken the time to watch the videos and if you do not understand the rules of MeBob that define the set ups , please do not post charts and trading commentary to this thread. The central theme of this thread is the MeBob method found in post #2. If you are posting charts and trade commentary that is not MeBob compliant, please take it to a trading discussion thread elsewhere at Forex Factory. This is a systems thread dedicated to a specific system. Here is the introduction to the rules of MeBob: 1. You trade it on the SP500 Index. 2. You use a 5-min chart. 3. You only use it during Regular trading hours only (09:30am – 16:00pm Eastern Standard time). A more detailed explanation follows below: 1. The US stock market index opens at 09:30am New York local time. 2. The 5-min reference bar to wait for is the 10:05am–10:10am bar. 3. This is the 8th 5min bar into the regular trading session. 4. Observe the high and the low of the reference bar. 5. Draw a horizontal line through the high of the reference bar. 6. Draw a horizontal line through the low of the reference bar. 7. If the SP500 closes above the high of the reference bar “highest line”, it is a BUY signal. 8. If the SP500 closes below the low of the reference bar “lowest line”, it is a SELL SHORT signal. 9. The stop loss is placed either at the most recent swing or above/below the reference bar. It is a simple method. Those are the rules we are working with as of today, 03/12/2025. If you are going to post any other type of trading method, system, or set up that is not MeBob compliant, check yourself, and find a more appropriate FF thread for your post. If you are a new to this thread, OR if you are a newer trader OR if you are a veteran trader who is struggling with consistency, perhaps you are fighting the demons of FOMO and over trading, then watch this video: Inserted Video And then watch this video: Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hello friends, this was my entry today respecting the 10 points, then there was a re-entry that I did not take. I will continue with my 20 days test with this strategy and then I will carry it out in a prop firm. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Indeed. Let's also consider re-entries. I closed out a 10point win on ES today, then went back in for another short. I was mindful of the Al Brooks wedge forming and the double bottom though so closed out early.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I took the first entry for +10. I initially decided that since the 10:30 AM bar didn't close inside the MeBob range that it was not a second signal. And then as I re-read the MeBob rules and rethought through it, I decided that going forward, I will consider such price action to be second entries. My only restriction on this would be that MeBob is one trader per bar. So the first MeBob trade was entered on the open of the 10:25 bar, and the take profit filled during that bar as well. Although that bar did trade into the MeBob range and closed below, it would not, imo, qualiify for a second MeBob entry. One trader per bar. The second MeBob trade, which I didn't take, is a new bar, so it should be considered a second independent signal. Kudos to anyone who caught either or both of these trades! Here is my live trading video from today where I discuss both the clarification regarding second signals, as well as give a few thoughts on the future introduction of additional price action elements. We are on an extraordinarily good run with MeBob. We haven't needed any additional defined set ups. However, the day will come where we get a few MeBob losses, and it will be good to have one or two solid price action set ups to add to the trading plan. I want to select only price action set ups that are visually easy to identify in real time. Furthermore, whatever set ups I add to the MeBob Trading Plan will be such that the entry orders will be based on closed candles, using either buy or sell stop entries above/below the signal bar high/low, or enter at the market when the bar closes as we do with MeBob.

A very relaxing way to approach aa business that is often far from relaxing! Kudos! Now that is what I love to see and your approach is exactly what I'd hope others will follow. Do 20 days in sim test account. By that time, you will be skilled at following the rules, and you will likely develop the ability to trade through the losses that will come. Stick through the first losing streak, whenever it comes, and your performance will rocket past 99.99% of the 1, 072, 526 traders who are registered members of the FF community!

Anyone can set up whatever money management they wish to set up. We've discussed the need to set an ATR function moving forward so that the take profit can be set to match volatility. At times 10 points is perfect, and others it may be far too much. Anyone who wants to use MeBob as a trend following strategy may do so. Today, for example, is the type of day Rob Falk wanted to capture with this strategy. ES is now down more than 40 points from my short entry. I know myself well enough to know that while I'd love to grab 40 points of profit on a single trade, I am more likely to accumulate 40 points of profit over the course of 4 or more trades, and I'll be more relaxed doing it that way. For most traders following this thread, I think the rules and money management I am using is likely going to yield the best results in terms of building patience, discipline, and the ability to follow a trading plan without hesitation or fear, and thus achieving what Mark Douglas calls "trading from a carefree state of mind."

Nasdaq Mebob. Worries me. So far , if you only need ten points to be happy, you may have a hard time holding this beast back. The SP500 is usually more sedate and less terrifying when watching your profit/loss in real time. Must go wrong sometime soon? But there is enough loot, one feels, to ride out a few losers in the future? I am not a great or articulate trader but some tolerate me for brightening up their day.

Well done. Consider that if you can achieve tenpoints on one trade it might be better to trade with more contracts than seeking more points via more entries.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
What some people forget in their blinkered outlook is that people, myself included, welcome an approach that requires self discipline and reduced overtrading. I have my own approach but Vids idea works brilliantly as an overlay with my own Road map. Pre -market analysis, then Mebob drawn up and then I can sit and wait. Simple is good but I won't shout if people disagree with me.

I was playing around with this concept of larger take profits but ultimately what I settled on atm is exiting the market after two losses. I believe there's enough edge to be profitable with a one-to-one rr. From my personal experience and back testing I would say that MB should cover a 51% WR.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I agree 100% with this though, tulip, and indeed it is the way in which I intend to grow my trading account this year. You don't need to trade more often, and you do not need to trade more volatile instruments. Just trading the ES, if you can average 5 points net per day (so we look for 10+ points per day, but accounting for inevitable losing days) we average 5 points. If you start with $2000 and max out at 10 ES contracts (starting position size = 3 micros) , using a 10 point average stop loss per trade, and risking an average of 3% of equity per trade, that $2000 will grow to nearly $250,000 in the first full year. Now, you start year two with $250,000, and everything remains the same: end of year two your account equity will have grown to $940,000. Never trading more than 10 ES, and your risk per trade will have dropped to about .6% of account equity per trade. However. the ES is big market. You can safely enter with more than 10 contracts without experiencing adverse slippage. Let's say that in year two, you will increase you max position size to 25 ES, again, max risk always limited to no more than 3% per trade. Now your year two total is $1,9 Million USD. Find a method you can trade day after day without hesitation or fear, keeping risk at a level that allows you always to maintain a care free state of mind, and then simply increase position size. If volatility contracts, and you now average only 3 points per day, but your max risk per trade is now 5 points instead of 10, the numbers will still work out. Note that the above examples are using a $2 risk for each expected $1 profit.

If you took all MeBob entries since noon there would be 3 losses and a 4th trade is trading very close to its stop loss. I like Machine's suggestion to quit after two back to back losses. Two losses in a row would be indicative of a trading range, and you don't want to be be going short at the bottom of a trading range and long at the top. That fourth trade would now be a loss, ad a 5th trade is underwater quickly if you took it. After the first two losses, MeBob should have been retired until tomorrow morning. Also, 12 noon to 2 PM typically a range time for the S&amp;P500 crowd. Thinkgs to consider going forward. Some very nice price action set ups, however. I'll go over all this in tonight's review video.

I only trade the first two and a half hours, after that price is not always so volatile and I am usually tired but I am an old git and may be wrong but so far I am happy with it added to my own approach - simplicity and preparation are my mainstay.

Hi T, I am 57 yet my body feels like a 87 year old due to my health. I think I am the old git. You have the right idea with your trading and charts they are easy to understand.

The MeBob original rules are as follows: Here is the introduction to the rules: 1. You trade it on the SP500 Index. 2. You use a 5-min chart. 3. You only use it during Regular trading hours only (09:30am – 16:00pm Eastern Standard time). A more detailed explanation follows below: 1. The US stock market index opens at 09:30am New York local time. 2. The 5-min reference bar to wait for is the 10:05am–10:10am bar. 3. This is the 8th 5min bar into the regular trading session. 4. Observe the high and the low of the reference bar. 5. Draw a horizontal line through the high of the reference bar. 6. Draw a horizontal line through the low of the reference bar. 7. If the SP500 closes above the high of the reference bar “highest line”, it is a BUY signal. 8. If the SP500 closes below the low of the reference bar “lowest line”, it is a SELL SHORT signal. 9. The stop loss is placed either at the most recent swing or above/below the reference bar. It is a simple method. The following personal rule has been added: 1) Stop MeBob trading for the day after two consecutive losses (thanks to Machine Learning for this suggestion)

Vid - as an aside and I won't post about morning UK session of SP500 again, I was wondering if the UK based trader could use the 8:35am bar as a UK MeBob approach. Just a thought in case anyone has looked at Mebob for UK opening time for the Dax, SP500 etc, during the first two hours?

IMO most traders fail coz they try to trade every move of the market insteada sitting tight with a swing position... Since cable bottomed on Mon 13th Jan i have only had 4 trades in 2 months (4 trades with multiple small positions)..... all long and all profitable and now im flat... OVERTRADING is what destroys retailers every fuckingtime..... for the life of me i do not understand peeps trying to catch every turn, ITSIMPOSSIBLE and they just making it hard on themselves..... Just my 2cents guys

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Mr. T. Total agree!. Problem is position size. A lot of us stupid traders don't know how to position the trades. You mentioned putting multiple position. problem is a lot of us don't know where do put the next position and fear of loosing restricts us from placing multiple position. I have tried it and I never get timing right and end up with multiple loosing positions. You taught us well so trying to learn from mistakes.

SP500 and Nasdaq both gave two basic Mebob trades that worked out within a two hour trading slot for my 10 points each. Well sort of....tried stopping for ten on Naasdaq but it was well past 10 points before I clicked on mouse. The SP500 is gentler on the nerves?

"Coffee and MeBob," or "MeBob in the Morning," or, "Your Morning MeBob." It seems as though that 9:30 to 11:30 is the MeBob Golden time. Well, 10:05 to 11:30. I saw your post earlier, and I think your idea about a UK morning MeBob is a good one. Try one reference bar for a few weeks, accumulate at least 20 trades. That is probably all you need to determine if you're on the right reference bar or not.

This is one of the most enlightening videos I've seen since I've been doing this. Since I started (2022) there is how an obligation that the R:R must be 2:1, 3:1 and even 5:1. I know it will sound a bit “cliché” to talk about warren buffet but the example he uses about his ratios is extremely enlightening for those of us who learned and above all “believed” that the ratios should be greater than 1:1. if you are in a situation similar to mine and you learned that your ratios should be 2:1 or more, please watch this video, I can assure you it will change your perspective completely, listen to what he says and see the statistics he presents.

Good stuff! Lots of validity to the risk conversation* Another point of interest for me today was the behavior of price inside the range .

I have no problem is the UK traders want to explore the MeBob here on the FTSE or the DAX. I would prefer if possible that they choose one or the other, at least during these early days of the MeBob exploration. The more we can all build our experience together on a common ground the better position we will all be to determine the extent and limits of whatever value MeBob brings to our trading plan(s). That 8:35 AM UK bar is the logical candidate to use, at least initially, it would seem. I look forward to what you guys find!

Still not feeling well, started the video late. Two MeBob trades today, one for a -10.75 point loss, the other a +10 point win. The net result was a loss on the day of $45.86. I used an alternate price action stop based on the post MeBob inside/outside/inside set up. I discuss what I believe would be more appropriate stop loss management based on price action. I will do one more week of original MeBob entries only, but I will be incorporating price action stop management instead of risking to the opposite extreme of the MeBob range. Still another hour or so left in the MeBob morning trading window but I am done and going back to bed. I'll do the MeBob review this evening if I am up to it or else sometime over the weekend.

Some really great lessons to be learned today.. I believe controlling your risk is the most important aspect in trading considering you have an edge. VidVad give some good examples of controlling risk for his trade management. Kudos as always to Al Brooks. This forward testing of Mebob is it really good exercise in honing your skills. .

MeBob is the creature of the late Robert Falk. The price action set ups have been learned primarily from Al Brooks and others, e.g. Linda Raschke, Bob Volman. I take credit for none of it. All we are doing here is putting some good stuff together to make what will hopefully prove to be a consistently profitable, easy to follow trading plan populated with two or three patterns, and that is all we should need. Godspeed on your road to recovery, blue!

I'm based in Europe so I took more of a look at the FTSE. 33 consecutive days going back from today. I looked at two possible entries. On candle close of the BO candle and entry on retest of the MEBOB zone. Assuming a 10 point SL, 62% WR on entry of the BO candle close, 57% on the retest. I looked at the maximum run-up of each trade. Suggestions welcome from those wiser than me as to how to trade it. BE after 10 points, move SL to +10 after x many points etc?

Thanks for your input! Very good info to have, and would love to create the same set of data with the intended market.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Excellent work, Andy. I have a personal belief that most retail traders like us do not use spreadsheets to collect and collate data nearly as much as we should. I've had some of my biggest break throughs doing just what you are doing here. As you know, the way I'd trade it is to take a fixed profit target, bank it, and move on wait for the next set up. If you are looking for ways to trail, go back and track a trailing stop, kept 1 or 2 ticks above the high/low of closed five minute bars. Then I'd look at 1r and 2r and 3r targets. And I would also consider using an ATR function. What was the current 8 period ATR at entry, how many ATRs did price move in favor of the entry? Lots of options. But if you are still working at becoming a consistently profitable trader, the best option will be 20 days using a fixed take profit and a fixed stop loss; and if your reward to risk is less than one, that is, imo, fine, especially for the 20 day exercise. Thanks for doing this work and sharing here! This is the type of sharing we should be doing - very much in the spirit of the community. Great job, Andy!

Hey everyone, Great discussion here about FTSE and DAX observations, as well as risk control strategies. I’ve been following along and wanted to throw in a related question. I’ve been working with RTS5Pattern indicator for pattern detection and market structure analysis. Given how much we’re discussing MeBob setups and price action-based strategies, I’m curious—how do you guys feel about custom patterns as a trading tool? Do you think designing and refining your own setups, like MeBob or other structured patterns, gives a real edge, or do you prefer sticking to well-established price action methods? Would love to hear if anyone here has experimented with something similar! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #220 ---
My intention for this thread is to use MeBob + two or three commonly recognized price action patterns.

This is the first "PriceBob" video in which I will be gradually introducing elements of price action trading I largely learned from Al Brooks, and to a lesser extent Bob Volman and others. This first video is a brief explanation of "Breakout Mode," and specifically inside-inside bars, outside-inside-inside bars, and inside-outside-inside bars. These are small tight trading ranges that provide defined entries into possible reversal and continuation breakouts. The video is just over 30 minutes. I started with an outline, per Machine Learn's recommendation, and more or less stuck to it. I take credit for none of the content. I'm merely a messenger sharing what I've learned from others.

"A losing trader can do little to transform himself into a winning trader. A losing trader is not going to want to transform. That’s the kind of thing winning traders do." Ed Seykota, Market Wizards interview I don't know how the youtube algorithm works but time and time again it proves itself capable of delivering to me content suggestions that on the surface seem so far removed from anything I might remotely be interested in but in fact happens to hit home in important ways. I watched this video last night, though at first, I scrolled past it with no intention of looking back. However, the title of the video sparked my memory of the above famous quote by Market Wizard Ed Seykota. I couldn't help myself. My brain was telling me there was a trading connection to be made and so I must watch THAT video. Those of you familiar with my trading journal here at FF will know that another youtube video about a professional roulette player provided me the insight I required to get over what had been a very daunting hump with which I struggled in my trading for years. I had then and still have no interest in playing roulette. But watching that video allowed me to make a dramatic improvement to my trading. Here is the link though I'd expect most of you will look at the title and thumb nail and say "Yuk, NOT for ME!" lol Can't say that I blame you. Inserted Video In short, Docherty shared the story of three people with severe weight issues, two who are beyond morbidly obese, and one of who is dangerously underweight. None of the three, she asserts, will ever likely change what needs to be changed in order to improve their health and their relationship with food. One will not change because she simply doesn't want to change. She knows her eating habits are harmful, and she knows that unless she does something her life expectancy will be dramatically reduced (her doctor had just told her she has no more than six years to live unless she loses weight and quits smoking). However, she just doesn't want to change on either count. This reminds me of another Ed Seykota quote: "Win or lose, everyone gets what they want from markets. Some people seem to like to lose, so they win by losing money." The individual in the second case won't change because she doesn't think she has a problem. She refuses to acknowledge that she needs to eat more. In her mind, she is eating healthy food choices and therefore there must be something else wrong that she isn't putting on weight. Since she doesn't see her eating (something she has 100% control over) as the problem, she takes no responsibility for her unhealthy underweight. The third individual will not be able to change because she doesn't believe it is within her power to do so. She says she has tried to lose weight in the past and has always failed. Rather taking responsibility for these failures herself, she has given up her sense of agency and now believes herself incapable of success. She knows what she needs to do to change, it seems as though she'd like to do what she needs to do to change, but she no longer believes in her own ability to do those things and to effect long lasting, meaningful change to her health. Docherty then suggest we watch the following video about Jesse Shand and his journey from obese to healthy and back to obese. Here is the link to that video. Inserted Video Here is how she concludes her presentation of Jesse's story: "Though this is not the most lighthearted way to end the discussion about what is an incredible, inspirational and heartwarming story, I did want to be true to the reality of the situation as it stands today. And I hope that this highlights how much of all of this is all in our own heads. How much of ourselves, and how much of our limitations are self-imposed. Jesse viewing himself as a fuck up, who's always been a fuck up, is obviously drastically different than the way, you know, all the millions of people who've been inspired by his story view him. The way he's looking at it, he's identifying with the part of himself that's repetitively failed, and let himself down, while ignoring the other part of himself that went on an incredible journey, came out the other side a different person, and inspired millions of people in the process. But the truth, and not just for Jesse, but for all of us, is that we're neither 100% the failure or the fuck up, or 100% the success story. We're somewhere in between. But if we believe the thoughts that tell us that we're 100% the bad stuff, then that stuff can end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I hope that, you know, if Jesse ever watches this, that it highlights for him that all of this shit is in his head, and he can change if he wants to." From "The Moment Everything Changed for Jesse Shand," by Kiana Docherty So why post this here? Today? To share these few thoughts: I have asserted my belief that following the MeBob method for 20 days as part of Mark Douglas's famous trading exercise is an excellent way of cultivating the habits of a consistently profitable trader. If you have been held back by any or all or some combination of the common trading errors such as system jumping, FOMO, over trading, over leveraging, revenge trading, time frame jumping, etc., then you must change your behavior in order to transform yourself from a losing trader into a consistently profitable trader. You must 1) want to change, 2) accept that you have to change, and 3) believe it is within your power to transform yourself into a consistently profitable trader. You are not a losing trader because of the market, the algos, the HFT firms, or the market makers. If you are not winning consistently then you are the problem, and you are the solution. Mark Douglas's exercise requires a 100% rule based, non-discretionary mechanical entry, take profit, and stop loss method. MeBob clearly ticks all the boxes. Start small. "I will not trade until after the mebob bar closes no matter what I see, " is one small change. I used to fomo badly at two times of day: right after an 8:30 AM news release and at the 9:30 US stock market open. The cure? "Today I will not touch my mouse until the 8:35 bar closes." "Today I won't touch my mouse until the 9:35 bar closes." And then I'd do it the next day, then the next. Eventually I was able to resume trading at those times and I'd only do so if I had a defined set up present on the chart. Identify your bad trading habits. Pick one to work on first, and decide how you can stop it from happening. Maybe you set a hard daily loss limit on your trading platform that locks you out if lose a certain amount. Maybe you can set your trading platform to limit the size of your trades so that you do not over leverage. Maybe set a timer that will go off when you are to start your trading and do not trade before the timer. All of this post is directed to make us think about Ed Seykota's words in a meaningful, transformative way: "A losing trader can do little to transform himself into a winning trader. A losing trader is not going to want to transform. That’s the kind of thing winning traders do."

My Key Takeaways : "A losing trader can do little to transform himself into a winning trader. A losing trader is not going to want to transform. That’s the kind of thing winning traders do." Ed Seykota But the truth, and not just for Jesse, but for all of us, is that we're neither 100% the failure or the fuck up, or 100% the success story. We're somewhere in between. But if we believe the thoughts that tell us that we're 100% the bad stuff, then that stuff can end up being a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you have been held back by any or all or some combination of the common trading errors such as system jumping, FOMO, over trading, over leveraging, revenge trading, time frame jumping, etc., then you must change your behavior in order to transform yourself from a losing trader into a consistently profitable trader. You must 1) want to change, 2) accept that you have to change, and 3) believe it is within your power to transform yourself into a consistently profitable trader.

Ever since I discovered Al Brooks he's played a part in how I trade.. The guy is literally a legend in my mind. With such a vast wealth of knowledge. Truly remarkable. I've spent a lot of time going over his videos on trading the open mostly.. Golden nuggets throughout those. Anyways back on track with Mebob... I noticed in the video Vidvad that you did not highlight this ioi on Thurs..and i can't recall if you mentioned in the recap (that would require serious brainpower to remember Thursday at this point ) It does have equal lows but as you/Al say perfect doesn't exist and if it looks like a setup then others see it too. As we had rejection of the open and the outside bar rejection of the open and settlement.. Mebob was already out with +10 But what a great setup to catch that swing trade.. Anyhow heres a chart fwiw. Cheers ! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

obviously 90% of trading is psychological...how one handles emotions but the other 10% is account size you may be wasting your time trying to "teach" forex traders from other countries who can open a cfd brokerage account with a hundred dollars and 500:1 leverage and expect them to be anything but gamblers as I posted to the cable thread earlier today that even tho I was right in my analysis for the last 3 months I still lost money countertrend trading GU cause my emotions and hubris took over my brain...luckily since I'm American I have a big enough account since I daytrade stocks as well and as you know we need a minimum of 25k at all times in the account which in reality its closer to 100k in the account since you can get a 90 day suspension from opening new trades for breaking the pattern daytrader rule mebobs a great entry setup but that's not gonna keep the guy with a bucketshop brokerage account from losing all his money with the humungous leverage furriners get to use... and human nature being what it is they all max out on leverage pretty much on every trade till they hit rock bottom and then start trading smarter LOL perfect example is in the prop firm hub where most just yolo especially montygoldy LOL...he seems successful gambling with the 49 dollar futures prop accounts cause he's got a good paying job and therefore disposable income unlike the majority of FF members who come from poor countries American stocks have 2 to 1 leverage...futures are about 50 to 1 but people from overseas that mainly trade forex with their no minimum brokers use 500 to 1 and then wonder why 95% of people blow up their accounts

Great and exciting post. Sorry, my words are not related to the strategy but I could not resist and I want to congratulate you! I think this is the work to be done. Everything you refer to is true in any area of life or any job we want to undertake. Trading is not easier or more difficult.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Not trying to teach, as I am simply sharing some things I've learned along the way and experimenting in public to see if I can, like a mad market scientist, put some of these things together and not only not blow up, but find a beneficial, perhaps even profitable concoction. I'm no guru, furu or otherwise. If by chance I happen to help one person find one thing that improves his or her trading by just 1% as he or she tries to get 1% better every day (thank you Stacy Burke), that will be a bonus to my efforts here. FWIW, it would be a mistake to think I'm not personally benefitting from creating the content in this thread more than anyone who may be reading it. As an aside, I believe there are many American traders here at FF who can choose futures over forex. I believe there are many European traders here at FF who can choose futures over cfd's. I' take no responsibility for the choices others make. I can only be me. I understand that many are in tighter financial circumstances than others. YOLO'ing is a choice. YOLO'ing is a harmful behavior that stands in the way of consistent long term success. I can't make someone addicted to yolo'ing prop accounts stop. Only the trader himself can make the decision and take the behavioral actions to transform. Because of prop firms, the opportunity to access capital and to trade regulated futures markets is within reach of many more people than was the case when FF started. https://x.com/TradeDayFunding/status...25486180741602 I trade with TradeDay and I can tell you there is no way a trader can build a $130K balance in a TradeDay live account by yolo'ing and hoping for the best. Only a disciplined trader can succeed at TradeDay. Maybe there is one person somewhere in the world who happens across this thread and and something here strikes the proper chord and that person takes the steps to leave bucket shop forex behind and seek access to exchange listed futures and then takes his few hundred dollars to join a prop firm, trade a tested trading plan, fixes the urge to yolo, over trade, revenge trend, and fomo, and build that few hundred dollars in to $100K USD or more. Difficult? Extremely. Impossible? Heck no! Inserted Video

I 100% agree with you. For $399 his video trading course is without equal in the day and age of $99 discords run by supposed "professional" 19-year-old college dropout options traders. FWIW, I'm watching section 14 on Trends today. I try to rewatch a section every few weeks, usually takes anywhere from 2 to 3 hours. imo both time and money well spent. For anyone who doubts the value or is unable to afford the course at the moment there is a lot of free Al Brooks content available on youtube. Some of the best nuggets come not from video Brooks himself has posted but from interviews he has done. His interviews with desiretotrade channel on youtube, especially the first one from about 8 years ago are excellent.

In the spirit of Mebob I want to share some further sources on T.O.D. patterns Linda Raschke whom we all know and also from a fellow Canadian trader Cory Mitchell. Cory Mitchell if you havent heard of him came from a traditional prop firm 20 yrs ago. and truly has excellent insight to the markets... His website is https://tradethatswing.com/ I have posted in the past about "Time of Day Patterns" and 10 am is one of them... Both Linda Raschke and Cory Mitchell talk about 10 am reversals set ups etc.. Which may give some context to Mebob and the 10:05 setup. Stacey Burke has spoken for years as well about 10am ish setups.. His thinking is its the 4hr candle opening at 10am and HTF traders... Anyways heres an excerpt from Linda and link to the pdf where it comes from. "When a trader practices the principles of swing trading, he learns to develop a conceptual roadmap in his head. In the S&amp;P market, it is particularly important to learn to think in terms of concepts because there can be so much distracting intraday “noise”. Some more examples of concepts are: mid-morning trends tend to carry into 12:00(EDT) +/- 15 minutes. The best average intraday trends tend to last 45 to 90 minutes before having a countertrend reaction. The earlier a trend starts, the earlier it peters out. There is often an opportunity to play off a reversal of the move into 10:00 (EDT) +/- 15 minutes. The markets tend to be more emotional at the beginning of the day when a good move counter to the initial opening swing can occur. If you learn to think in terms of concepts, you can master the markets instead of becoming a slave to the charts. Time-of-Day Tips: On average there are only 2-3 great S&amp;P intraday “legs” or swings. Most professionals catch only 3-4 really great trades a week, if that! (Most trades will often be very small wins and losses). So don’t be too harsh on yourself if you feel that you are missing the majority of the movement. Overtrading suckers one into seeing only the trees and missing the forest. Traders tend to be creatures of habit, and thus it is easy to compile market tendency charts. There are several key patterns which have held constant over time. One common pattern might be: the market rallies or sells off into noontime. At this point, a large percentage of the floor traders and brokers in New York go to lunch and a countertrend correction begins. When the late stragglers get back from lunch, the morning direction tries to reassert itself again. If the afternoon rally or selloff starts too soon, it won’t be able to sustain itself through the end of the day. It will die out around the bond close. However, if there is an afternoon “shakeout”, (usually between 2:00- 2:30), then the market can finish in a trend mode into the close. Do not fade a move into the last hour of the day, for there is no time to exit gracefully if wrong. The odds suggest a better entry price the next day on the probable morning follow through. Moves on Friday tend to end at 3:00, not 4:00, too many traders prefer to flatten out or even up before the weekend. On many days there occurs what I call the 3 o’clock jiggle. Right around the time the bonds close, there is a great 10-15 minute scalp trade. I believe it occurs as an emotional reaction to how the bonds go out. The trade usually lasts for no more than 10 to 20 minutes, but is fun to anticipate. Sometimes a good selling opportunity occurs around 2:00. In fact, it is amazing how many good turning points occur on hourly readings, for example, 10:00, 12:00, and 1:00. It think this is because people are more conscious of time at these moments, creating a slightly sobering effect." Attached File(s) Building a Trading Foundation LBR (1).pdf 1.2 MB | 73 downloads And from Cory Mitchell : Excerpt from Cory Mitchell's article: https://tradethatswing.com/stock-mar...ting-patterns/ What the Stock Market Tends to Do at Different Times of the Day Time-based patterns are based on a time of day, not price direction. A reversal could be a reversal of whatever trend direction was occurring up to that point, if there was a trend. 9:30 am: Traders come rushing in and the price often sees a quick push either high or lower. The price may bounce around for several minutes before picking a direction. Lots of movement in first few minutes means it’s likely to be an active day, or at least start out that way. If there isn’t a lot of movement in the first 15 minutes of the day, then it will probably be pretty quiet. Action could come up in later, but until it does, it will be quiet. 9:45 am: There is often a big pullback or reversal around this time. If the price had moved strongly after the open, now is the time to be careful. It could be a brief pullback, providing an entry into the existing trend, or it could be much more severe. 10 am to 10:30: Around 10 am there’s often a major reversal in price. It could be temporary, or it could be significant. The high or low that occurs around this time will often last an hour or more, especially in individual stocks. Cory posts several charts of these time based patterns on that link above... The above is just an excerpt. And Lastly in regards to VidVad's Roulette epiphany ! In LBR short book above you must read “Trading and Betting the Horses” I think it relates to Gonzalo Garcia-Pelayo Exquisitely ! Actually well worth posting the highlights of it... Why do I post all of this...simply because I believe the 10:05 Mebob setup is not just a random time he picked. Quite the contrary....There is very good reason he used that time ! The journey continues ! Cheers

Your very Welcome Vidvad and here's one more thing... Was going to post this later but why wait... My announcement to the trading world LESS IS MORE............. This is where I am at...Late 50s and wanting to simplify my life in many ways. Something I have been working towards for a number of years for many reasons and moreso of late with some health BS.... I’ve traded stocks, futures/commodities, options, forex, cfds etc over decades. I am done with them all. I have made the decision this weekend to scale back my trading and focus on one market and one timeframe. That’s it.... I love Oil Nattygas etc etc ...but no more...They can do what they want.. I DONT CARE ! Getting up at 430 am Pacific time just doesn't fit anymore,,,the early bird can get the worm ... I am just a squirrel after a nut. 10-15pts I am very very happy with that. I really dont need anymore...tbh even 20-30 pts net weekly is more than I need. I will still get up early ish... But more so to meditate and quiet me time. Going forward it’s back to my first indice I ever traded the ES....that’s it. And the 5min TF... The first timeframe I learned on when I started trading online in early 2000s... Before 98ish-2000 it was phone my broker and trades were only place EOD or EOW. My epiphany came about from following Vidvad and his progression to Mebob. Am I trading Mebob...nope... But what I am trading is something highly similar, A 5 min OR breakout. Many many similarities...with entry risk etc. So I will participate in the Mebob thread..following, commentating and perhaps sharing some things of value as what I do is in alignment. The 20 trade Mark Douglas video really got my brain ticking and it came down to simplifying and focus... I dont want to spend any more time at the screen than I have to...Thats literally 2 hours a day MAX...930-1130am NYT Then my day is done.. No more chasing it all.. Funny enough I saw this post on Twitter today from a ES trader Adam Mancini. And it was like WOW isnt that a coincidence !!! My exact thoughts. Ive deleted all my templates off my charting software...(still in my head ) One Market/One timeframe/One template/One setup. Cheers and make trading a pursuit of pleasure ! EDIT : I've also reduced my chart to RTH only. Not interested in Globex. Not interested in Asia or UK markets.. Scaled down to scale up you might say Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This post should be liked by everyone who reads it, blue. The roulette epiphany allowed me to experience a sort of rebirth as a trader. It looks like you're going through the same. "LESS IS MORE" indeed! Let's GO! https://images.app.goo.gl/UhkcbePARbf9QycJ6

Well said.Yes.Taking control on your terms. At the risk of sounding delusionally omnipotent I treat the market as if it is there to serve me. I have the expectation that at the end of the week, provided I do what I have formulated to be my way (method ), I shall receive a positive return on time invested. I don't fear the market it just is. This may appear naively unsophisticated ( possibly a "reversion" to this "naive unsophistication" is beneficial?! ), but one must look inside and ask the honest questions to achieve the point where they can hop out of the trading sauna, and trade with ice water in their veins. Traders who have been part of VidVad's threads have discussed simplifying the mind and by extension the trading system process. It's a symbiotic process. Balance is all important. That balance is directed, achieved and arbitrated by the individual. Apologies if I should've directed this to your other thread VidVad.

Hey guys, I've been following this strategy and I've found it very interesting as I'm primarily a breakout trader, but with my main focus trading Gold. I've adapted this strategy to trading Gold during the NY session and I have also adapted a personal breakout indicator that gives an alert when there is a breakout according to the original MEBOB rules. It will work for indices like S&amp;P, etc. If you guys are interested I can share it, it's quite useful to get an alert when there is a valid trade signal so we don't miss it.

I don't have any objection to sharing such an indicator here. I would like us to stay away from the EA/bot rabbit hole. This thread is for active readers of price action. But I have no objection to indicators that draw or alert to MeBob levels.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Remember what Al Brooks says: "If price action looks like a pattern, it will tend to behave as that pattern even if it is not perfect." Also from Brooks: If you are waiting for perfect signal bars and perfect patterns, you'll be waiting a long time and doing very little trading.

I traded and did the review on the March 2025 ES contract. Starting tomorrow I will be trading the June 2025 contract. There will likely be subtle differences between the two so be aware that if you are still on the March contract, then your charts may vary from mine in certain respects starting tomorrow.

2 losses today, I will follow your entries from the 09:30 candle breakout (OR). I will also look for 10 points once I get the break. Thank you bluesteele and vidvad for sharing your knowledge

--- 帖子 #276 ---
The only way I have ever tested anything.. is by going through the historical charts on the 5 minute bar by bar.. my last test was three or four years of the ES testing the 1hr initial balance with a close outside of that IB and the probabilities of rage expansion from there.. As for the OR.. I do know of some that use the 5 minutes successfully.. I have used the 15 minute OR successfully. And the old pit traders use the 30 second OR.. As we all know it's more likely just a matter of trade management risk etc... I will be sitting down at some point this week and going through the charts post-covid. .. but I just do it the old fashioned way pen and paper and day by day through the years.. lol... You know I started out paper trading as a kid maybe 13 14 years old I don't recall.. and I would draw line charts every day with the closes out of the newspaper.. and I still do things the same way... In my opinion yes it would be a heck of a lot faster for somebody just to code that pop out the data... For me I get to see visually all of those charts the nuances and I believe that's part of my Edge. I do like the me Bob because I believe there is something to the 10:00 rotation. Again maybe it's got something to do with the 30 minute opening range.. or simply it's a rotation of the one hour and 4 hour time frames.. I'm like an old dog on a bone I will go through the data of both at some point relatively soon.. The reason I am using the 5-minute OR I've seen thousands of equity opens... So no I don't have the data at this point I just have the muscle memory so to speak... Rambling Blue

As mentioned before I am looking at UK and US Mebobs on the SP500 ( keeps it simple and only one data feed to pay for the Futures - if I tried dax as well that would be extra cost for dax feed) Seems UK was okay and US mebob was not so good today. Putting twenty of these pages together going forward. Blue - I can also look at 5 min OR breakout on same charts - why do you torment me with more homework

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Interesting, thanks for sharing. Do you trade them in the same way as the MEBOB method, ie enter on confirmed closed bar that breaks the 5min candle?

Good plan. I'm going to go back and look over more past data. See if fixed targets work better and moving the stop to BE after x points etc etc

First off i have to give a to Vidvad for starting this thread, nice and clean and simply (fairly) and the clips are probably better than sliced bread I hardly post anything and i one would be very hard pressed to find any trace of me online. Maybe it's the avg age of (some) of the posters on this thread but i kinda feel at home with my official age of 61 (despite a lack of proper gray hair ) I have done my share of programming and currently trade on the MT5 platform (no arguing about taste ). Currently i'm writing a bar coloring tool that colors the IB and OB so that it is easier to spot the IOI, IOO and II. I'll share the code once i'm happy with it. However, i'm wondering whether it makes sense to use decimals whilst looking for the particular bars, or just use 1 decimal. Why? Simple if it looks like a IOI but is off by 0.17 should we not still look at it as an IOI? Personally i would strip the decimals but i would appreciate some additional views on this. Looking fwd to participating and sharing .. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thank you bluesteele for sharing this. Could you tell me what are your parameters when it comes to take profit when you get an OR break? It would be very helpful

--- 帖子 #271 ---
You are welcome buddy. I trade on 1 min charts and enter by the break of the range. SL mid of range, TP 2.5 and move to BE 1:1. I only trade the first 30 min, thats it! Only take one trade per ticker, so say 1. trade is over, no more trading on that ticker. Also no trades Friday, as the market range more... PC PS: The sharp eye will note that the losing trade on UBER ranged back and forth exactly within yesterdays 5M opening breakout range, probably not a coincidence?

Hola Fream1,, Espero que todo esté bien y gracias por tu pregunta. I had planned on making a post(s) in regards to this.. But I will say let me say at mi corazon yo soy un momentum trader.. I am a momentum trader..thats my sweet spot.. Traditional scalping is not my deal,,nor swing trading.. I aim to capture chunks of daily moves...and a big part of that is using the 8 ema channel... I got that idea from Laura and her thread Roadmap in the systems forum... I will say now I think that is one of the best threads on FF and her journal. Laura is a very smart talented trader... Alot to learn from her posts. And I have posted in the past a few times about the 8ema channel. But to be honest I haven't wanted to draw much attention to it... I will make this all relevant soon with chart examples etc. I consider many things in my head when the opening bell rings and much of it is Al Brooks based and that ties into the 8ema channel and how I use it as a gauge of momentum and as a dynamic TP tool and as well for entries...(another story) Follow along the thread and I will post more on this subject as it is so important. SO I am glad you asked But at a minimum I am looking for 10pts with my initial position... I want to "ring the register" asap then I am looking to peel off at 20 and the last 3rd a runner to 40+ pts...and that will be decided by time and momentum. (8 ema) I don't like to just give a simple answer lol... like 10-20 and 40+pts.... since you asked my "parameters" My parameters IMO need some explanation to be understood fully,,,,, So I will leave it at that for tonight and I will post charts and more explanations... Despite my seemingly lengthy reply I do like to keep things simple . Buenas Noches Blue

I've been trading the first 5min ORB on nasdaq for a while now with great success. The only issue I have is with fakeouts. It can break the ORB and then immediately reverse, and I havent figured out a good way to account for this other than risk management. Also keeping the charts completely clean with no indicators. But the success rate is quite high and quite quick. So any ideas on fixing the fakeout problem would be a great help.

Guys I had some DMs regarding how I trade the 5M ORB, I will start another thread later in order not to mess up Vidvads great thread here. PC Here it is: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5m-orb-trading

Like you, in her journal she set an exercise to stick to the rules regarding breaks of channel for opening and closing trades. Add some skin to the game and many will find just how quickly the rational mind is attacked by fear and greed etc. Don't dismiss fear and, especially greed, as easily vanquished demons. They are always there, looking for a way in the back door (if not already resident.)

And this is where most systems threads at FF jump the shark. Nothing personal Danger-Mouse, but this post leads to a path 100% opposed to what we're doing here. Read Post 1 and 2. The introduction of anything other than a fixed bar reference or price action on the 5 minute bars is not part of this thread. No filters. Anyone who feels they can never trust his or her ability to learn to read price and instead must rely on indicators to supplant judgement can go to any of the thousands of systems threads available here at FF. This is a Filter Free Zone.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
In my journal here at FF I refer to my "roulette" or "Gonzalo" method. It isn't an ORB method but it is quite similar in that it trades breakouts of ranges, the rnages are based on time intervals, and the size of the interval based on volatility. The only way I've found is, as you mention, money management. Simply take your loss when a quick reversal occurs. Use position size to your advantage if you can. For example, instead of trading a full sized NQ, you can size down using MNQ. I also found I had a better win rate when simply riding out the reversal because the initial break on the NQ for my approach often was the so-called "right direction." But the drawdowns were uncomfortable. One observation on the NQ, if a breakout of a range quickly reverses, especially if it occurs at a previous daily or weekly OHLC, then it is usuually bets to SAR with price, as the "breakout" wasn't a breakout, but a test.

Off the rails indeed .. Speaking for myself this is probably the biggest trap created by the improved infrastructure due to computers etc. Adding all kinds of 'stuff' to charts is done because it can be .. it has become too easy to muck everything up, eye-candy does not equal better trade performance! I was already working on on a couple of tools but have decided to not go there this time around. First make it work manually and then, maybe, add some tools. Manual practice will register much better than glancing over the pictures created by tools .. we all (~95%?) go like " looks good so lets put it on" without doing the proper due diligence .. but it takes effort and dedication, not something that can be found in abundance anymore. Excellent call Vidvad to keep things nice and tidy.

In this thread, we are exploring the use of the following: Defining set ups based on patterns observed to repeat with regularity on the 5 minute candle chart, primary market of interest is the S&amp;P 500. Fixed bar entry methods based on the range of a particular 5 minute bar between 9:30 AM and 3:00 PM Eastern time, with the primary such bar known as the MeBob, which is the 5 minute bar that opens at 10:05 AM and closes at 10:10 AM Eastern. Opening Range Breakouts is an example of an acceptable fixed bar strategy. Support and Resistance levels such as previous daily OHLC, previous weekly OHLC, the current day's OHLC, and intraday swing highs and lows on the 5 minute bar chart. We do not use any derivative indicators to define or "filter" set ups. The presence of a moving averge is the choice of the individual trader. It can be used as a reference tool or sight aid. It is not to be used in this thread as a "filter," e.g. I will only take a long MeBob trade if price is above the xyz moving average" is not acceptable in this thread. It is acceptable in your own trading or in your own thread, but that is not how we want to approach the solving the problem of trading by price alone in this thread. One can note price pulled back to the moving average of their choice, however, if a trade set up is being discussed, the set up must exist independently of the presence of the moving average, i.e. two traders trading the same defined set up would both have taken the same trade based on price, even though one trader had the MA plotted on his graph and the other trader doesn't even know what a moving average is. Filter Free Zone: Note the difference between the following two trading entry rules: 1) I go long when a 5 minute bar closes above the open, and I sell short when a 5 minute bar closes below the open. 2) I go long when a 5 minute bar closes above the open, but only if price ia above the MA, and I sell short when a 5 minute bar closes below the open, but only if price is below the MA. Rule one is the sort we are looking to develop here in this thread. Rule two might be a fine rule, but it belongs in a different thread. I am not anti-indicator. I don't want to ban indicators from chart pics shared in this thread (within reason). But for the purposes of this thread, we are not at all interested in derivative indicators as either filters or as variables used to define entry set ups. Thank you for your consideration.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Also, I also support the use of indicators that serve to highlight either a defined fixed bar, e.g. an opening range indicator or MeBob indicator. I also would be fine in the use of indicators that highlight inside/outside bars on the five minute chart. My caution with those, however, is that some such indicators will hide whether a particular bar closed as a bull bar or a bear bar, and that information may be appropriate or even necessary in some cases to define and thus identify certain set ups.

Some points from Al Brooks to consider: "80% of opens have reversals" in other words MOST breakouts fail...So why trade anORB ? Well...The question then is Where do most ORBs fail ? 5pts 10 pts 15pts etc and secondly is the next point below. With good risk mgmt AND knowing the question I just posed..DO you have a way of just taking all the setups using RM to enable you to capture those larger chunks on those 20% days.? "First bar of the day is H/L of the day 20% of the time." Once a week generally the market will trend. That got my brain ticking 3 or 4 yrs ago...How can I take advantage of that and actually trade it. "Everyday wants to form H/L of the day early" ( 18 bar probabilities ) This I find can be useful and I will be sharing an idea or two on this in regards to how I use that. Hi Danger Mouse ! Im basically in the same place as Vidvad on this...Ive tried over ther years every indicator under the sun..and some do work better than others as filters but what this all comes down to is just taking those initial ORBs as they come and just accepting at least 50% will fail,,,,and thats OK. My only filter is Major red news at 7am generally and I also do not like FOMC days like today.... Just some quick thoughts this morning Cheers Blue

2 wins 1 loss today, i had a loss trading the OR. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I was reading Laura's “roadmap” thread and personally I found very useful the use of moving averages, which from now on I will use as a filter for my OR and MeBob entries. I will trade only if the price breaks in favor of the moving averages, otherwise I will not trade. Personally I feel safer trading this way, and surely there will be days when I will not “catch” some trades, I think it is also good not to overtrade.

Ok, I'm going to take the rest of the week off from the thread as I am not going to spend any more time posting about this being a FILTER FREE ZONE. It isn't worth my time to fight this fight. Very simple request: All talk of "filtering" trade ceases when I return. Again, I am not anti-indicator in general, but in this thread I am adamantly anti-filter. If you are reading this thread and still feel that filters are an appropriate contribution you are reading it wrong. Very disappointed that this has to be said, over and over and over. Here is today's live trading. I started soon after the open but after the ORB so I missed that trade. I was trading an abridged profit target today because it is FOMC day. Also, these are sim trades (I clearly state as such in the beginning of the video). I did not trade live today as my trading plan has a rule that I do not trade on FOMC days. Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Final though to the filter fetishists: If you learn to trade price action based on objectively defined set ups, your filter will cause you to lose out more by missing profitable opportunities than it will ever save you by waving you any losing trades. In other words, price alone beats price + filter over the long run.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I'm not sure why you disliked my post sharing the indicator and made that comment? The indicator is following the original mebob rules and any filters that I added are completely optional. Anyway, post is deleted. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
You didn't need to delete the post, only the mention of filters. Filters are not an option in this thread. That is why I disliked your post. And from this point forward I will dislike any post mentioning filtering trades by making reference to a derivative indicator. I don't think it is unreasonable to try to keep the thread on point. Anyone who wants to pursue MeBob with moving averages and oscillators is free to start a separate thread to do so. If you want to share your indicator, that is fine. What I disliked was the explicit mention of using MA's to filter set ups. I can't be more clear than I have been.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Let's put it like this: If LauraT herself showed up here in this thread and suggested we should add the 8 ema channel to the MeBob or the 200 SMA to filter long form short ORB's, I'd dislike her post as well. I'd still follow her and I'd still read anything she posts to her Roadmap system thread and her journal. But I don't want that content here because this thread is about trading the 5 minute price action without indicators and with possible fixed time price bars as reference ranges. . Go to TooSlow's HOLO thread and tell him you want to filter HOLO trades using an ema and see what he says lol

--- 帖子 #312 ---
If you were to watch my live trading video from thsi morning I discuss the OR and how I'd have traded either side of it. I did take a long above it for +4 points. Today is turning out to be a much better FOMC day that I have often seen. MeBob short hit for +10, and a MeBob long has come with 5 ticks of a 10 point profit target. I'd have my stop loss at +4 points on the MeBob long if I were in it (I am not).

Blues Ramblings,,,,,,,, “Normal thinking does not lead to profitable trading” ~Tom Hougaard Being a Forest Gump type of guy who likes to keep things simple my take on this is...... We all know about system hopping and endless indicator searches and then endless setting tweaks of the latest greatest indicator,,,,, But why do we do it ? We want to make money.. But more-so its we want to avoid pain... The pain of losing and the pain of being wrong. We want to be right...Our egos want us to be right always... From primal beginnings to a more frontal cortex learning from school. We take tests and we are judged on being correct. And the more correct you are..you are then judged to be smarter and better ??? But are you really ? We are taught to work hard... Work hard finding more indicators ? Our normal thinking of being correct and working hard etc coupled with our ego leads us with our primal thinking and brain to Control Outcomes... We all want to be right and control the outcome.. It is ingrained in every single one of us for survival. But Normal thinking does not lead to profitable trading. Bless Tom Hougaard for that statement and his book The Best Loser Wins.... Because that is the bottom-line here... Why would I use for ex a 5min ORB when I know 80% of breakouts fail ? It’s simply because I have gotten to the point where I accept losses like an old friend. They are welcome in my home. And perhaps you may want to look at them as just a business expense.. All businesses have expenses...and why should we as traders not have these expenses... All businesses have losses in one capacity or another. Embrace the losses...learn from them always yes....But no indicator will ever perform as good as good old price action for us retail traders. Normal thinking does not lead to profitable trading....The Best Loser Wins. And finally if you are serious AND really want to develop a CONSISTENT INCOME trading then you will watch this Mark Douglas video and do the exercise. And if you do remember this post. Inserted Video Normal thinking does not lead to profitable trading....

Interesting thread. I hope vidvad doesn't mind me posting an indicator - I promise it's harmless. All it does is put a rectangle on your chart. I made this a while ago when I was playing around with ranges and now added a bit of code so it can be anchored to a bar. You just need to set your chart to M5, set useFirstBar to true, then it'll draw a box from this bar, with the height of this bar and the 'length' of 24 hours. Long story short, you can simply mark your 'Mebob' bars with it. You'll need to adjust the start time according to whatever timezone your bucketshop uses of course. It'll look something like this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can also use it to mark arbitrary ranges / times and check if Bob's really the best uncle you can find.

Bollocks, i missed the OII .. Had a long limit iron in the fire and forgot about the FOMC as such .. saw the down-spike and pulled it in a reaction .. The rest of my evening was slightly less than it should have been Another day today.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Small question wrt the ii, ioi and oii setups/patterns. Do they come with an expiry bar number? This can probably be found in the appropriate literature but i thought asking the question as such would not hurt ;-) The reason for the asking lies in the fact that i see them quite regularly and it appears as if a 5-bar extension might be fairly useful. I will test this as well but the question could provide a good starting point. Tia

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Any trading range implies breakout mode. What the inside bars and multiple inside bars do is mark a "triangle" on a smaller time frame. So for i, o-i-i. i-o-i, i-i etc, the entry rule from Brooks is to use a stop order to enter. Once it extends to 4 or 5 bars, then it is a tight trading range (TTR as Brooks says) and you can enter on stop orders. In those cases, I prefer to wait for a bar to break AND close above or below the range rather than entering on a stop. It doesn't matter which entry technique a trader chooses so long as the trader is consistent. What you don't want to do is flip back and forth between entry approaches as that is sure to confuse and frustrate your efforts at consistency, imo. Yesterday, bar 4 broke the opening range high. Had it closed above the ORH, I'd have entered with a market order. Because it closed at or below the ORH, I used a buy stop above the bar's high to enter. Many trader no doubt entered long before me using buy stop orders 1 tick above the ORH. My way will result in less reward on those trades than the breakout traders make. However, my way is a higher probability and will result in a higher win rate than the breakout traders who enter on range breaks rather than wait for close and continue entries.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) I like that idea. I saw pipcruiser also uses that and I think it is worth looking into with the five minute ES. The guys in my discord and I definitely use 50% as a stop, and also use 50% and 100% measured moves for trailing on the NQ. Excellent chart share!

--- 帖子 #324 ---
This is not meant for you Schinken but a general clarification for anyone following along in this thread. One more attempt to be clear about indicators in this thread: Anyone who posts an indicator for a trading platform that facillitates marking a fixed bar, e.g. MeBob, the five minute opening range, is fine. Furthermore, people are free to posts screenshots of their charts with any manner of indicators they wish, so long as they are highlighting a price action set ups we use, e.g. o-i-i, i-i, i-o-i, etc, or fixed bar set up we use, for example, MeBob and ORBs. What I would like to keep out of this thread is any talk of using a TA indicator as a filter or as defining variable to a set up and signal. That's all. You want to keep an ema on your chart? Fine! You want multiple ema's and an oscillator? Great! So long as your chart clearly is posted to highlight a set up in keeping with the purpose of this thread your post is welcome. I am not anti-indicator as a matter of principle, but I am anti TA derivative indicators for the purpose of this thread. My discord friends, who include FF members Ed777 and JVT, and I have explored all manner of indicators together. They will tell you I have been a prolific consumer of indicator usage. However, this thread, in particular, is a pure price action thread . It really should not take this much energy and effort to make this point. I'll not be recording any additional videos until the weekend at the earliest. Let's see if the thread can stay active and focused over the next few days without them.

Hi bluesteele thanks for sharing this, one question, when do you consider that the stop should be the high or low of the OR candle? do you apply 50% of the OR candle only when it exceeds 20 points? Sorry for these questions a bit silly, I would like to understand a bit your approaches. I hope you are well, cheers

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Nothing silly about your question at all. I'm interested in this as well.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Fream there are no silly questions... At this point I am willing to risk 30 pts as my max daily. I want a minimum everyday of 2 swings at the bat with the BO as most fail. So I decided on 15 pts.approx The other consideration is the close of the BO bar.. How large is that bar ? So coupled with the size of the OR and the size of the BO bar I then determine whether to enter full size or scale down. I will post some charts that may help....nothing fancy with me ever. I am not a big math guy..My strongpoint (generally lol ) is I have a very sharp eye for details. My background required that and many many years of reviewing charts trading charts etc.. I'm also a bit of a pitbull lol I hope that helps.. and again no silly questions ! Cheers ! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Blues ramblings..... Some observations...First chart...I really liked that after that strong push from the Open..Price did not close Above the prev days Highest close. You might think that price will push and test the PDH but I have seen umpteen countless times when it just comes close to the daily H/L And on a Higher TF thats a nice DT with yest High. After that rejection of PDH a nice leg down (red) 3 bar pullback and a IB... Great setup short.... a good day all in all. and other chart WOW 3days so far this week with Bar being the H or L of day... impressive. One other note.. I am always very aware of where price is in relation to the prev days Equity open(s) I find it very important on many days. Whether it comes into play in my trading time is another thing... But always important to pay attention to the OHLC. Eyes are stinging and brain quite tired,,past my bedtime... Hope the last 2 posts make sense If not..we will try again manana ! Cheers !

Vidvad, whilst watching the video and looking to the left side of my screens a question came to mind. I understand what Al is saying esp. with regards to the futures mkt, however, there are those of us who dabble in CFDs and there we are looking at 'continuous prices' so i was asking my self whether there is a consensus regarding the H/L of the day. Does one include the 24H H/L or do you just look at the US trading session H/L (obviously referring to the S&amp;P). I suppose one can 'modify' the CFD series to mimick the US session ..

I guess you could say it's been an interesting morning .. took my two swings at the bat.. and calling it a day. Very happy with my performance today A plus on execution. Despite it being a net losing day. My first ORB short resulted in a full size loss.. second breakout was to the long.. peeled off one contract at + 10.. other two were stopped out at the trigger bar plus two. Overall a very good week A+... In all honesty I don't recall the last time I executed an entire week of trades with about as close to flawless execution as you can get... One chart one time frame one setup. .... Will post up more in-depth details and charts later Cheers.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I believe that nothing is more harmful to day trading than a trader's belief that he or she needs to know the "logic" behind every move the market makes, as though there is any grand logic operating behind the scenes pulling the strings. Almost every contract traded has not a retail trader like us involved, but instead has one large institution buying from another large institution who is selling. And the vast majority of these institutions are profitable almost every day. There is no logic other than the momentary shifts of supply and demand. If, for the moment, there are more institutions wanting to buy more contracts and shares of stock than there are institutions willing to supply that demand with contracts and shares of stock at that price, then price must rise to induce additional supply to come to market. Supply and demand, the moment to moment balance or imbalance between the two, is the only thing that moves the market. Think of the patterns we trade. i-o-i, the inside bar-outside bar- inside bar, is a pattern of balance. It is breakout mode because once one side or the other is no longer satisfied by the available demand for or supply of shares of stock or futures contracts, price will be forced out of that balanced price range. If more institutions want to buy and that demand for purchases cannot be supplied by the institutions willing to sell for a price within that balanced price range, the breakout will to higher prices. If suddenly the supply being offered for sale by large institutions rises above the demand for shares or contracts by institutions, price will be forced to move lower out of that balanced price range. Most institutions only transact business when the US stock market is open. The opening range may be viewed as indicative of the initial balance between buyers and sellers at the time when all this volume floods the open market. The break indicates an imbalance. The ORB set up for us retail traders seeks to capture the move on those days where that initial imbalance causes price to move out of the range far enough for us to make a profit, to buy high and sell higher, or sell low and buy back lower. Institutional traders working their day jobs. They are, like most workers, creatures of habit. These habits create different time markers throughout the day. The opening 5 minute range. I believe that the opening 30, 60, and 90 minute ranges are also important. 90 minutes is also the first 18 5 minute bars. I have heard talk in some corners of the trading internet the high and low of the range from 9:30 AM to 12:45 PM Eastern is significant, as it is the exact halfway point between the opening and closing bells. I never looked into it, just mentioning it because it makes sense. The worker bee institutional traders who move the market go to lunch at 12:00 noon, and start trickling back to their desks between 12:45 and 1:00 PM, so for them that is the morning price range. Maybe there is something to it? Anyway, the answer to why did the market go higher or why did it go lower is never the news or the moving avergaes or the oscillators. It has always been and will forever be the minute to minute fluctuations between the interests of institutions needing to buy shares and futres contracts and institutions needing to sell shares or futures contracts. That is the job of the institutional career traders. Some are needing to buy shares because they just received a huge deposit from an employee pension fund. Others need to sell because they are making a market in put options making them net short puts, so they hedge their short puts by shorting shares or more likely, shorting futures contracts. There si now way any of us, not even the "smart money" institutions, can ever figure out the exact reasons behind the momentary balances and then imbalances between supply and demand. However, what we do know because we can see it repeat on a regular basis is that these balances can be seen when we plot the transactions on a graph. Likewise, we can see when demand is outstripping supply, because as we plot these prices on our graphs the prices are increasing steadily. Similarly, we see when prices are dropping steadily, and at those moments all we can know is that the supply of shares and contracts by institutions needing to sell at that moment is greater than the demand for new purchases of shares and contracts by institutions who may be induced to buy up that supply at some level of balance below the current market. Once you accept that the "logic" of the market is really the unknowable infinite variety of reasons some institutions need to buy and others need to sell at each and every unique market moment, then you can relax, focus on your set ups, accept that sometimes your set ups will not result in the movement the edge tends to forecast and so you take your loss and await the next set up. That's it. News algos do there thing, true. But the market is going to do whatever it was going to do once the 30 seconds to 5 minutes of news algo spiking is done. How many times does the news cause a big spike down to a low that ends up being not only the low of the day, but far below the market's ultimate closing high? Was the news bearish? Or bullish? I'd say it wasn't either. The news algos did what they were designed to do to make as much money as they could for the institutions whose business is writing and trading news, and then the regular market forces took over and price did what is was going to do regardless of the news. Don't tell the business journalists however. They make their living by pretending they can sort it all out and tell us at the end of the day exactly why the market did whatever the market did that day. But if they really could do that, they'd be able to tell us in the morning where the closing price was going to be in less than 8 hours time, culdn't they? It is all supply and demand, shifting minute to minute, moment to moment. The traders who buying and selling determines this balance and imbalance are creatures of habit. There habits form identifiable patterns in the graphing of their transactions. Pick a pattern of habit you like, and trade it, rising their coattails in the direction the pattern indicates, and cut your losses when the pattern's movement is so short lived it doesn't offer a profitable exit. You only need one of those patterns to make a living.

One chart One Timeframe One template..... This is my focus (at the moment) and I do have my blinders on to concentrate on execution. Al Brooks talks alot about probabilities. From the first 18 bars to patterns etc... I want to highlight a key concept of Al's that could potentially,,,drastically improve your probabilities for success. So when I say one chart well.....I would like to talk about another timeframe rather than the 5min. And Al does as well...this is all from Al. Now I know/we know when we look at the 5min chart and perhaps we have a Prev day H/L marked off etc that in essence what we are looking at , bigger picture, is a daily candle,,, OHLC.... And personally I find them useful/important. Again as we all know markets are fractal and these 5min bars are constructing the daily bar,,, we have an incredible amount' of detailed information with the 5 min charts. Al talks about the probabilities of setups and each setup can have varying degrees of probabilities depending on the context surrounding that setup... So what is one easy way to increase your chances of success ? Easy its by looking at the daily chart in your market prep. And utilizing my favorite quote...Timings Levels Behaviour of Price. This week was an excellent example of using the Daily to trade the 5..Whether its an ORB trade or MeBob... When I executed my first ORB trade on Friday( a short)....I knew it was low probability but I executed nonetheless as per my current plan. Despite it being low probability the market can do anything (Mark Douglas) so I was positioned to capitalize if indeed it broke down. Lets get into the daily chart and a simple way Al Brooks uses the Daily chart when trading the 5min... It's TAILS. (for now) Al has several great videos on Youtube where he talks about how the 5min chart forms the tails on the daily bars..and when those tails are formed... Early on for ex. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I should clarify one thing about me...I am a momentum trader.. I have traded the last 4 or 5 years strictly on momentum setups. Mostly time based based on OR/IB and Als 18 bar prob's. So even though I am trading the 5min ORB , I am looking for those larger swings and strong momentum moves... Which is why enter with multiple contracts....starting with peeling off at +10 and looking for upwards of 30-40pts+ as the market has been giving for awhile now... Let alone it will offset my losses from the amount of failed BO's that I will take. Thus looking at the Daily is very important for me... In the context of how Al Brooks looks at/uses it. In a Nutshell nothing new in trading...and this is just a simplistic age old way of ananlysis. What is the daily chart doing ? Markets only do 3 things... Up Down Sideways... KISS principle. SO we are trading an ORB or a MeBob...These are early session setups..And as Al says (slides in another post after this) And as Al says the market likes to put the H/L in early.... Such important concepts to know. So what is the daily chart doing ? Well weve had an extended leg down on the daily,,,and if you look at the tails of those candles on that down leg and when those tails are formed on the 5min...you may go ah-hah... This week has been range bound..approx 100 pts. Now if you look at the chart above (last one) and look at where do those tails line up with on the 5min... Is it within my timing ? and how does price behave at those tails(levels) within your timing ? Now this is a rule based thread where we are not just making willy nilly discretionary blow in the wind decisions. But adding context/confluence can greatly increase your odds. I can guarantee you If Al was trading Friday... he would be all over buying the market low...And more importantly he would only do with a SETUP... You must have a rule based setup.. ORB Mebob etc... So here's a couple of charts from Friday...One with the 5min ORB and one with MeBob...( one weekly Globex as well) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Peeling back the Onion is simply this. Be aware of what the Daily is doing and how it is behaving.. IMO no need to complicate things. No need to look at the 15 or hourly or monthly... The daily in your market prep and One timeframe whilst trading. And remember we are Risk managers bottomline...We trade Risk...and thus need to control it and capitalize on it.

Can't lie, getting a tad confused. Are we incorporating the ORB system in conjunction with the MEBOB system? Also, in my opinion, all the candlestick patterns are sudo filters. Candlesticks are representations of price and time, as are many indicators and filtering techniques. Seems a bit arbitrary to only allow this form of filtering and not others if at the end of the day profitability is the only goal.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi MachineLearn Imho and I only speak for myself... Mebob thread is yes about Mebob AND Al Brooks methods... Al Brooks can be confusing with just the sheer volume of information he provides... It's vast. The basis of Mebob is just a "Breakout of a Range on a time based interval" 5min ORB is the same concept. So the overlaps are similar. How one trades with regards to risk parameters is an individual choice.. But also I believe Vidvads idea here is to explore Al Brooks concepts around the basis of the thread which is Mebob. And how perhaps to enhance Mebob ... Just my take on things and I apologize if my posts re the daily etc are confusing things...not my intention Cheers !

--- 帖子 #352 ---
MeBob and ORB are same method, different reference bar. Price action is continuous flow and immediate. Filtering by a moving average or oscillator is applying a mathematical formula to the raw data that is price, and then using the result as a value by which to judge a current price by a value that is derived from price, often many bars ago. Thursday ORB for example, what moving avergae or combination of moving averages would have signalled the trader to get long at 5706? And even if you can find one, what guarantee does a trader have that that would have been the particlar combination he was suing that morning? Wedge top at last week's high, three bar reversal, lower high double top, all would have had a price action trader short before price had even pulled back to the 20 ema, for example. No sir, I cannot agree that price action is a pseudo filter. As Brooks says, "price is truth." Each tick that prints is a transaction and each transaction tells us something about the market. I do agree that price bars and candles are themselves indicators. However, the signals such data provides is derived from price itself, or at least as close to price as we can reasonably be expected to draw an edge short of attempting to trade a single tick chart. In the end, the closest one can get to trading price itself is to trade in a pit which doesn't really exist any longer, or trade using the price ladder and reading the bid/ask sizes as transactions are immediately reported to the "tape." I can't do that and that is beyond the realm of this thread. Reading price bar by bar is as close as we can get to pit trading or trading using something like the jigsaw trading platform.

Your indicator verse candlestick argument makes sense. While candlesticks are indicators, they're the purest version and I definitely respect that. Not necessarily agreeing with multiple setup bars for a range but that's just my opinion. Cheers!

Positioning your trades in the wicks .. This takes me back to a thread that was started , quite a few years ago and i came across a couple of months back. Something tells me you and a few others (Vidvad? ) have had some exposure to the Pipeasy thread as well. Practice makes perfect .. Not only Mark Douglass has stated this ..

Contextualizing our operations is important, but even more important is how we manage risk. Excellent post bluesteele!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I guess that was poor wording from me. I did not mean the "reason why the market moved up", I'm completely happy with supply vs. demand as an explanation for all moves up or down. My question was, do we have reason to believe that a breakout from a certain range at a certain time will return results that don't simply follow a normal distribution ("normal" as a math term, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution ). Because in order to show positive expectancy for the setup, this distribution will have to be skewed in the direction of the break. Otherwise we're just flipping coins or playing pachinko.

Thought I would share a little bit of my work...Again I do things old school...I dont program. I dont use any software..Just my eyes and the charts. When I'm doing this I'm also looking at days of the week and prev day OHLC etc.. So here's some of my notes from Oct 2024 until now..and how I mark each day. ES # of times the 5min on first close outside of the OR hits 20 pts 30 pts and 40pts+ without a close on opposite side of OR or a wick. Oct 24 11 days 1-20+ 5-30+ 5-40+ Nov 24 13 days 5-20+ 4-30+ 4-40+ Dec 24 7 days 4-20+ 3-40+ Jan 25 5 days 2-20+ 3-40+ Feb 25 10 days 1-20+ 3-30+ 6-40+ Mar 25 7 days so far 1-20+ 1-30+ 4-40+ As well I have noted days that go 10+ and also days that when a second BO occurs how often does the market extend 10-20-30-40 Saturday fun ! And here's a chart..Very simplistic but it works for me Cheers Blue Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In an interview several years ago Al Brooks was asked what the biggest mistake beginning traders make and he said: "The biggest one is focusing on risk. They focus on risk and end up using stops that are too tight or taking trades that have really low probability [because the risk appears small]." Another smart trader who used to post to a lot of trading forums (though I don't believe he ever was an FF Member) used to say that most traders focus so much on trying to not to lose that they bring about the very result they are trying to avoid, i.e. they lose. Mark Douglas makes this point as well. In fact, one could argue that Mark Douglas's exercise is really meant to take the focus off of risk and fear of losing and put it squarely on the only thing that matters: Focusing on the process of trading according to a rule based plan rather than the outcome, i.e. "win or lose?" of each individual trade. In fact, Mark Douglas's entire project was to try to persuade traders that focusing on risk is bull$hit to distract you from focusing on what really matters: Having a trading plan and following it without hesitation or fear. I've said this before in this thread: Most of the internet cliches about trading are nothing but bull$hit. For example, most successful daytraders, including institutions, have a risk reward that is usually less than 1, and on average no more than 1:1. That is, every BS youtube and discord Furu "teaches and preaches" you have to have a 2:1 or even a 3:1 profit to loss ratio. That's bull$hit. They tell you the most important thing is to focus on risk as the main matter of attention. Also bull$hit. The main focus should be on your own behavior. The specific behavior to focus on is following your trading rules and your trading plan and training yourself to focus on trading as a process and not worrying about whether your most recent trade or two trades or three trades were losses. Did you follow your plan and trade your edge? Great! That is all you need to do to make a lot of money and live a life very few can afford. If you instead focus on "finding" 2:1 or 3:1 reward to risk trades, or you focus on taking trades not because they offer a 60% or better chance of winning but because it offers "a small stop loss," then you have fallen into the same trap that has kept and will continue to keep 99% of us from ever succeeding. This thread you're reading right here, The PriceBob Strategy thread, this is the FF systems thread where we beat the bull$hit, escape the trap, and get on with earning our piece of the incredible profit opportunity that online trading now offers people all over the world.

They focus on risk and end up using stops that are too tight or taking trades that have really low probability [because the risk appears small]." What Al Brooks assumes here is that Traders risk based € per Pip/Points, instead of Risking each Trade lets say 1%(what most Traders do). They are taking tight stops, because they are greedy and want a High RR. The Risk seems then small compared to the potential Reward. The Stoploss then isnt placed on a Point where it makes sense (whether thats ATR, Market structure or whatever) but instead placed tighter without much reason behind it (emotional). Another smart trader who used to post to a lot of trading forums (though I don't believe he ever was an FF Member) used to say that most traders focus so much on trying to not to lose that they bring about the very result they are trying to avoid, i.e. they lose. Its again more about the management of a Trade, adding to losers, expending your Stoploss, because you dont want to take the loss and instead hope for the Market to turn. Mark Douglas makes this point as well. In fact, one could argue that Mark Douglas's exercise is really meant to take the focus off of risk and fear of losing and put it squarely on the only thing that matters: Focusing on the process of trading according to a rule based plan rather than the outcome, i.e. "win or lose?" of each individual trade. In fact, Mark Douglas's entire project was to try to persuade traders that focusing on risk is bull$hit to distract you from focusing on what really matters: Having a trading plan and following it without hesitation or fear. Mark Douglas's psychological principles emphasize removing fear from trading, but that doesn’t mean ignoring risk. His work focuses on trusting the edge over a series of trades rather than focusing on any single outcome. However, this doesn’t mean traders should abandon risk parameters. I've said this before in this thread: Most of the internet cliches about trading are nothing but bull$hit. For example, most successful daytraders, including institutions, have a risk reward that is usually less than 1, and on average no more than 1:1. That is, every BS youtube and discord Furu "teaches and preaches" you have to have a 2:1 or even a 3:1 profit to loss ratio. That's bull$hit. The claim that successful traders (including institutions) don’t prioritize risk-reward ratios is misleading. Many institutional traders focus on asymmetric risk-reward setups, where potential gains significantly outweigh potential losses. While they may take 1:1 or lower risk-reward trades in certain strategies, they also focus on optimizing win probability, trade frequency, and drawdown minimization. There is a reason that even big Traders emphasise on the saying "Cut your losses short, let your winners run" They tell you the most important thing is to focus on risk as the main matter of attention. Also bull$hit. The main focus should be on your own behavior and the behavior to focus on is following your trading rules and your trading plan and training yourself to focus on trading as a process and not worrying about whether your most recent trade or two trades or three trades were losses. Did you follow your plan and trade your edge? Great! That is all you need to do to make a lot of money and live a life very few can afford. Risk management is supposed to be INSIDE your Trading plan, its not a seperate thing. If you instead focus on "finding" 2:1 or 3:1 reward to risk trades, or you focus on taking trades not because they offer a 60% or better chance of winning but because it offers "a small stop loss," then you have fallen into the same trap that has kept and will continue to keep 99% of us from ever succeeding. Again... not the problem of focusing on Risk. Using a tighter Stoploss than you are supposed to is an emotional thing, its not the problem of having the wrong focus. There is not a lot you can control in Trading. Besides 1. When you enter the Trade 2. How you manage your Trade/Risk So it certainly should for a Trader be an important factor in Trading.

I never said risk wasn't a factor, only that it doesn't come close to taking precedence over the ability to have a process oriented approach to trading. Al Brooks very clearly and explicitly states that too tight a stop loss, not too tight relative to the reward. I'd post the link but the copy I have of the interview was shared with me by someone else and I don't have permission to post it. However, the interview from which the clip was taken is on youtube. I don't remember who the interviewer was, but he had an accent, maybe British, maybe Australian, I'm not sure. I believe the interview was pre-covid, maybe sometime between 2015 and 2019. The problem with the chart you posted is that it fools those who've not experienced the roulette epiphany into making (more likely, maintaining) false assumptions about the risk/reward equation because it mentions "win rate" without making clear that "win rate" is just laymen's speak for "probability," and that as reward to risk increases in favorability, probability, i.e. "win rate? shrinks. A 5:1 win rate requires only a 20% win rate. But the win rate of 5:1 trades is likely to be less than that. I posted a video about this a few pages back in the thread. A trader was advised when he was new to go for larger rewards relative to his risk. As he increased his profit target he started to lose more often. That is the fact that such charts as you posted hide. I feel bad for the newer traders following along who come across that chart now and think "oh, that makes sense." Once they do that, they're trapped. Failure is assured. If you want to keep your focus on risk reward and chasing 2:1 and 3:1 R/R's and using phrases like "asymmetrical risk:reward" do so. However, sports bettors, poker players, blackjack players, and futures traders who manage to earn an income they can rely on are not receiving more than $1 back for every $1 bet. In most cases, at the end of a series of bets, they are receiving maybe 50 to 60 cents in profits for every $1 bet over time. I'm not suggesting there ar no trading approaches that might give the 10:1 reward to risk. However, if it does, it will be like Gonzalo's roulette bets: Lose most, but when you win, it flips the ledger green. Billy Walters has amassed a huge fortune, betting $110 to win $100. He wins about 57% of his bets by his own account. That, to me, is what most of us should be looking for here: Bet $110 to $100 and win as close to 60% as you can. Do that, and you can make a lot of money. However, keep chasing the multi-baggers and that win rate will become vanishingly small and your account will likely be blown because in all likelihood, you don't really have the edge you need to deliver a 20% win rate on 5:1 trades. Finally, there is aa distinction to be made between "initial risk" and "actual risk." Initial risk is where Brooks would suggest you place your natural price action stop. As price moves favorably, the market will eventually reveal the "actual risk" of the trade. This is where one will generate multiple R's, not by designing a system to seek multiple R's, but by taking sound price action entries where the likelihood is about 60% in your favor that price will move in your favor, and on those trades that are profitable, your R:R will be higher than the initial risk appeared. But you have to be willing to risk that initial risk in order to trade from a care free state of mind. For those who have access to Brooks's trading course, review these two videos: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I used to believe all this bull$hit but I've made too much $$$ the past five months since shedding ti to believe it ever again. I'm no millionaire trader and I don't want to sound like my life is suddenly Lambo's and bimbos. But getting rid of those false beliefs has made a world of difference for my own profitability. Some of these trading beliefs are held by people almost as a matter of religion. I'm not here to slat anyone's god. And therefore, you should hold on to whatever beliefs you wish.

I think all the people here who are in the habit of actually using their own brain can agree that the infamous 2:1 in itself doesn't mean squat. Counter example, to drive it home through even the thickest skulls, and staying within the roulette theme of this thread: playing 2 dozens gives you a R:R of 1:2 minus the Zeros. If you win, you win ONE. If you lose, you lose TWO. But now the casino owner sits next to you and tells you: " You know what, buddy - it's your birthday, so we'll give you the Zeros for today and for the next month". In this scenario, if you don't spend 20h/day in the casino for the next four weeks, you have a comprehension problem. The probability for you to be down on the next five bets is still ~ 75% (think for a minute why). But the probability for you to be net positive over the next 1000 bets is very close to 100%. Do not take "common knowledge" at face value. Don't trust, always check.

This works on the NQ?

We're primarily working with the SP-500 and its derivative products, but I'd imagine that the methods and price action concepts we discuss here will work on any freely traded, highly liquid market. So probably applies to NQ, but perhaps not as well on live cattle or lean hogs?

The "bluesteele" template, with colors by the Brooks Price Action Trading Course. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I did keep the today's open indicator (green line) on the chart. I also am keeping my green &amp; red template in the workspace. However, it will be interesting to see how comfortable I can become with a true "less is more" approach to charting. I'll be using both for the time being. I don't know about the blue candles, and I might switch to basic black like you're using blue. Green "up " arrows are signal candles, and any trade entry would be made using a buy stop 1 tick above the high of each respective signal candle. I started trading right around the time MeBob opened. I'd give myself an A+ for most of the day, but then I fell into my old scalp for a tick or two and did a couple of those. +9 points gross, with a net of 8.67 points (about $433 USD). Also took me about an hour. I had a trader who was something of a mentor to me at one time. He would say, "hey, it's nice work if you can get it." I didn't record the live trading. However, I am going to record a brief video about how I am viewing reward to risk.

Love the template VidVad ... And I look forward to your video on risk. I just want to share a few thoughts There is no right or wrong way to trade... It really is a personal thing and you have to find what resonates with you. For example if I could pick one indicator.. it would be AVWAP..... I love using VWAP and moving averages etc.. but truth of the matter is I don't need them.. Because the real difference in your performance has nothing to do with any indicators... It's all about you.. and doing what works for you... Consistent execution of your trading plan is something we should all strive for no matter how you trade.. Hats off to those who execute consistently every day.. And that is what drew me to Mebob Focusing on simplicity and execution... Cheers

Tried SP500 in UK market and SP500 in US market. Albeit the ORB in the UK market took off the Mebob didn't. In its home environment the SP500 scored on both approaches. Will watch UK for twenty trades on SP500 but some will say I should trade Dax or FTSE. Might just stay with two hours a day on New York SP500 for the discipline. Maybe trying to trade two markets is asking for trouble. If I also choose FTSE for my morning trade then that is more expense for the Futures data feed. I may have answered my own musings

I missed this one and not sure how. He is 100% correct. Lot of people chasing clout on FF, twitter, and other corners of the internet I'm sure. They'd rather argue in attempts to portray themselves as superior rather than work on their craft.

This one got by me as well. I had a busy weekend and my follow up here has been poor the past few days a s a result. As far as MeBob goes, that is the work of a back test and forward test. As far as opening range breaks, I'd say the answer is emphatically "Yes." ORB's have a significant edge. Breakouts of the first 90 minutes appears to have an edge. Breakout mode set ups have an edge. But every one here reading this has to put in the work in order to become comfortable identifying and trading these set ups. My say so isn't nearly enough to make a go of it. As Linda Raschke stated in her book Streetsmarts, you only need one pater to make a living, but you have to practice trading that pattern until you make it your own.

Going to go silent here for a while as I reflect upon the impact FF member rockypoint has made on this forum and most especially in my life. He stands as a shining example of how we should treat one another, how truly to turn the other cheek when slighted, and how to embrace this life and enjoy one's time on this rock of dirt we all call home. He's made me not only a better trader, but a better person as well, though not nearly as good on either count as he. RIP rockypoint.

Hi everyone. I've been following this thread for a the past couple of days and I think the mebob is one of the simplest strategies I've come across. I plan to backtest it extensively to get the hang of it. Also, I saw you brought up some price action by Al Brooks some weeks back; the ioi, ii, oii... I kinda grab the concept but I'm not sure I understand it fully. Are there any videos or forum posts you can recommend so I can study it more?

The 5min opening ORB 2c short stopped out at -4pts $-400 I was in profit eight points or so $800 and really should have taken some off the table then... As price ran into settlement and couldn't budge past it for half an hour or so.. Next took a MeBob long on the close of the breakout.. 1 c +10 1 c +5 so $750 on the MeBob longs. I really should have booked my profits on the ORB short... And I would be up 1200 1400 for the day.. Holding out for 10 points cost me.. when I saw the market open today above the previous day high above closing price.. my instinct gut feeling is bullish.. since I don't operate on feelings I executed the short as per my plan.. My problem lied in the management of the trade.. I know that VidVad took the same trade and made the smart decision to book profits when price just stalled on the settlement.. And that's the way the cookie crumbles.. all in all happy with the performance but definitely room for improvement as they're always is. Cheers Blue

True. It's easy enough to download data for this and check how it would have performed in the past. I did and I'm genuinely surprised you seem to be correct when you say that ORBs have something going for them if you play them right. It's also a very comfortable way to trade, without any of the ambiguity the usual TA voodoo brings with it.

You could only be surprised if you think I'm in any way responsible for having made this "discovery" lol. The ORB concept was first publicized broadly nearly 40 years ago by Toby Crabel in his book Day Trading with Short Term Price Patterns and Opening Range Breakouts. He seemed to feel he made a huge error in publishing this book, fearing it would diminish his edge. He has spent the last 40 years trying to buy back nearly every copy in existence, which has pushed the price of what should be a $5 used book to sometimes $1000's of dollars per copy. I had a copy years ago and sold it. You don't need the book. The data he used was from the 1980's. He used a volatility measurement based on ATR to determine how far price had to "break" before he'd consider it an actionable breakout. imho, ORBs for we retail traders are best when the "keep it simple, silly" principle along with sound money management is applied. Linda Raschke also published some work back in the day on volatility breakout systems. Nothing new under the sun. What is different in this thread is that we are realy trying to apply K.I.S.S. and see how far we can get developing a simple, price action based method that is, in your own words, "a very comfortable way to trade, without any of the ambiguity the usual TA voodoo brings with it." FWIW, the "voodoo" is an illusion. It only appears to be voodoo and discretionary when no rule exists. For example, I won't buy or short an ORB is doing so puts my entry right at or very near what I call a pivotal level: today's open, yesterday's close, yesterday's high or low, last week's high or low. No voodoo. Just lack of rules based on empirical observations over time. If you apply rules based on market experience and recurring data, the voodoo disappears.

Hey everyone, I'm reading this thread in the background, but I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for this thread and for all the energy, time, and effort that everyone puts in here. The insights and discussions have been truly valuable, and I appreciate the willingness of members to share their knowledge and experiences. I'm looking to trade futures, so experimenting futures with this method. I also studied Stacey Burke his approach and I like it. Al Brooks is new to me, never had a look at the ii ioi etc bars. So i need to figure out what a ioi setup means in which circumstances. Somehow I prefer the ORB, so will focus more on that. I tried the two week free demo of Ninjatrader, but it is expired now. Does some one know a broker where you can have a demo account for a longer period? I know NT offers an unlimited demo account after sign up for an account, but I don't know if you need to fund your NT account before being able to get the unlimited demo account.... Kind regards

I have no idea what Toby Crabel does now, but if he is no longer a professional trader, he was at one time known as one of the best. Is the trend your friend or foe? "On the counter-trend side, perhaps the most well-known is Toby Crabel. He manages more than $1.6bn and has written the book Day Trading with Short-term Price Patterns, which can be found on eBay for upwards of $1,000 a copy. Despite the volatility in the markets, Crabel only had two down months in 2004: March was down 0.79 per cent and June was down 0.39 per cent. Such volatility lets one sleep at night. He finished the year with a 3.36 per cent return, less than the yield on a 10-year treasury. His average return per year has been 9.48 per cent and his worst drawdown is only 4.23 per cent. While some don't mind the roller-coaster ride of John Henry, other institutional investors are willing to pay a 3 per cent management fee and 20 per cent incentive fee to have the sleepy volatility of a Crabel." He is, however, still listed as the CEO and Chief Investment Officer of Crabel Capital Management, a firm of which he is also listed as "Founder." Who We Are – Crabel Capital Management I think it fair to say that it is highly likely that Mr. Crabel has derived significant portions of his income and wealth from trading, and in all probability, he still does. For years his firm was known as a short term hedge fund that derived much of its profits from day trading. It is worth noting here that Rennaissance Technologies, the most successful hedge fund in history, founded by the late mathematician Jim Simons, also was a large fund that day traded. If you read the book The Man Who Solved the Markets, you'd find that they actually found a lot of their short term edge using the five minute chart. Interesting stuff, and worth studying imho.

There's some stuff that makes sense, and then there's an incredible truckload full of total b0ll0cks people either dreamed up when they were stoned OR that was made up to sell something to hopeful n00bs. Or both. I think it depends on what you consider "TA". I think there were many honest attempts to try to make sense of markets, but today, to a very large degree, "TA" is something you sell to people who don't know better. And if you sold out of "TA-1" and everybody clued up to the fact you can just flip a coin instead, you conjure up "TA-2" for the next wave of wide-eyed newcomers.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I guess you laugh from experience and I guess I'm not alone

--- 帖子 #404 ---
nice system you got

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I consider "TA" as using any mathematical formula, applied to transaction data, to create an "indicator" of price that is then used to decipher if there is, at any given moment reason to believe price is more likely to up than down, down than up, or perhaps even range. I consider price action, or "trading by price" to be what we are attempting here: We are using indicators that are not derivitive of external mathemetatical fomulae applied to price. We are using price itself. The opening print is an indicator made by price itself. The opening range is an indicator made by price itself. The various tight trading ranges that indicate breakout mode, such as i-o-i are made by price itself. You need no formula to find those levels. And they are visible on every chart of that instrument. Everyone's 5 minute chart, assuming one is trading an instrument traded on an exchange and not in a bucket shop, will have exactly these same indicators.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
At times when ORB is too large for human consumption, like today, common sense will prevail..meaning "Grab All You can and GTFO", +70 It is not per my trading plan , but it is an exception to the plan for reasons of what I consider very unusual volatility on the short side, happens 3-4 times a year.

Hello! This thread made me create an account on Forex Factory, I have to say, it's an amazingly simple strategy. However, I've been very conservative with my TPs, I use the reference candle's size for full TP, creating less than 1:1 RR and I kind of feel like missing out, even though I am profitable. How do you guys handle the TP situation?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Really great stuff shared today by everyone. I'll be back to more regular trading talk in a few days, maybe a week. I'm still trying to accept the idea of FF without rocky. I appreciate everyone who continues to contribute here while I take a short break.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Welcome to FF! I use 1:1 with the range of the setup candle, starting at the close of the entry candle. You'll get stopped out a bit more but you'll also capture a bit more profit. This combined with a win rate above 50% and proper management, you should be able to turn profit week after week. The way I management my trades is by stopping all trading after 2 consecutive losses or around noon eastern. Also, after a win, I let the next consecutive trade run.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Welcome to FF! If this strategy resonates with you then my advice is to stick to it through the learning curve. It is simple, but since we are all humans, we sometimes make the simple not so easy! For someone new to this thread, the order in which to experiment with news things, imo, is: 1) MeBob 2) and/or ORB, and after you have logged a solid 20 trading days with one, the other, or both, and you are satisfied with the money management plan you've settled on to trade those, then 3) Price action using breakout mode signals, reversal bars, etc. Your ability and facility with these will be helped if you study either Al Brooks's books or his video price action trading course. Welcome to FF, and we're glad to have you with us here at the PriceBob strategy thread! Best of luck on your trading journey!

Im going to post some charts some marked up with notes others not,,, The main thing I am wanting to show is the importance of 3 things: TIMINGS LEVELS BEHAVIOUR OF PRICE... Those 3 things are the bedrock that my house of trading is framed upon and anchored too. Thank you Stacey Burke. Do I trade like Stacey no...except for one particular setup that has nothing to do with this thread.. I digress as usual ,,,,,,,, Timings levels behaviour of price.... "PRICE IS TRUTH"~Al Brooks MeBob is based on a specific timeframe and candle..as we all know 10:05 5min candle. I have thought about the why ? It is said or was said 20 yrs ago...The why was "simply to provide a trigger to get traders into a good trade" paraphrasing....... Trying to tie these thoughts here together Through countless hours of observation I have determined that the 10 am timing and level is an important one. Simply it is the start of a new 4hr bar... Now on my charts I have prev daily levels... OHLC..what does that represent.. THe daily candle...What comes after the daily candle typically the 4hr timeframe. So 10am is the start of a new 4hr candle...Think Longer TF traders...swing traders etc..Perhaps larger volume traders. There are 2-4 hr windows in the US session. 10 am and 2 pm. Go thru your charts and mark both of those open times off and draw a line and observe how price behaves around those 2 times.. Can you glean anything useful from that ? I know I have. and simply am sharing basic observations. How to use price Action / Al Brooks methods around these times... MeBob being a 10:05 Setup fits perfectly in the 10 am framework. Yesterday Weds Mar 26th was an amazing day. Price opened with a long 5min ORB that was stopped out LOSER then it reversed and gave a short sell signal.. 10am opened and at 10:05 Mebob formed and gave a short sell at 1020 CLOSE Price then went sideways for basically an hour..shaking traders out of their positions. BUT if you were aware of the PDL and how Price could not close and hold above that. BUT if you were aware of the 10am open and how price could not close and hold above that. Perhaps you PATIENTLY held on.. OBSERVING PA... Then 11:25 11:30 was the TRAP DOOR being opened and the floor fell away. Now go back and look at the 10am and 2pm levels.. I am sharing some charts showing these marked off.. 2pm is often talked about for market reversals..and trades off that time... Does it make sense ? when yo simplify it and think oh hmmm maybe its as simple as the 2 hr periods in the daily US session ? Again I relate this to MEbob ( Mr Falk) and how one can BE AWARE of this 10 am level and use PA setups around this level for CONTEXT.... "CONTEXT= Everything to the left"~ AL Brooks. How do you swing trade from a 5min chart...First by being aware of larger TF traders,,, and how they behave Range today was approx 59 pts... I took 25 near half on one entry. My target was 5778.00 which I called out beforehand... But I ended up closing manually at 5774.50 on PA... It is possible and I will continue to share how I do it... Im just an average joe that has been in the markets a long long time and sharing a few things I have learned upon the way that work. MeBob is an excellent method for traders whether new or old.. It works your execution skills and your risk mgmt. skills.. The thing with Mebob vs 5min opening ORB is you get some context from the 930 open till 10:05 and that is helpful. Today and yesterday are excellent examples... Both opening ORBS failed then the market turned and ran the other way... Normal behaviour... But if your trading the 5min ORB you have to take that first setup..because 20% of the days the market will open and run in one direction...and that you can capitalize on negating the previous failed ORBS. I think ive taken a few different forks in the road here lol...and if your still with me..your smarter than me as I think im lost lol.. Point is TIMINGS LEVELS BEHAVIOUR OF PRICE....and the 10am 4hr open and the 2 pm... Mark your charts...and observe.. Here are a few charts to perhaps either confuse or enlighten or dont give a damn... All are good ! Cheers Blue Yesterdays Chart..and how price behaved around the PDL and 10 am level coinciding with MeBob Attached Image (click to enlarge) todays chart showing the 5min opening ORB and MeBob Attached Image (click to enlarge) others observe PA surrounding TIMING Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hey, I just took the eu long setup, H4 Structure Bearish, I was expecting a pullback till the 0.5\0.4 Region before continuation lower. Internal M15 structure Bullish. We swept the ASL + market structure on M1 has shown a shift higher, I wanted to see a M5 candle close before entry so I have waited till it happened. I got in after the second shift from the M5 OB protecting the M1 Swing Low by +- 5 pips, and I have waited for the same scenario ( MSS on M1 + close on M5 ) on the DIXI. The reaction was lovely but I got the SL shortly after The real flex is not to be worried, the fact that in a long run you have a 100% chance for 6 trade lose streak is setting the attitude on the right spot for me. Let me know guys what you think about this setup, what would you change and is there any clear mistakes that you see ? Im thinking about Bias ? Maybe I do not look at it close enough, I can see now that Weekly we re deeply Bearish - 2CandleSuccesion. Y'all prioritize bias guys ? Wanna learn from better trades, im grateful for every help Thank you in regards, sending best wishes

--- 帖子 #420 ---
"Bias" is simply "Filtering" in another guise. This thread's appraoch is NOT to fall for the filtering bull$hit anymore than falling for the mythological 5:1 multibanger day trade bull$hit. All you need to know of the weekly chart is where is price right now relative to last week's high and last week's low. Some will also want to plot last week's close and last week's open. Those are fine too. But there is no bias nor filtering involved. Price is truth. Price action leads. It is in fact the only leading indicator we have access to in our trading (unless you learn to read a depth of market with bids and offers several layers deep - a skill beyond most, and certainly beyond me). Define you set ups by price (or, as in the case of opening range breaks and MeBob, by price and time). If you are getting stopped out of trades that go to target without first trading through a recent swing low (for longs) or swing high (for shorts) then the problem is with your money management, not the set up. Pick one market, one set up, and trade it for 20 days. At the end of those 20 days, you either have a scalable trading plan that can make you as much money as you could ever wish for, or you have something that still needs work. Study your 20 day trading records, isolate a variable to change, change it, and do another 20 day set. It sounds like a lot of time. But when you consider many of us have been at this, off and on for years if not decades, spending 3 or 4 months to hammer out a consistently profitable trading plan based on simple, defined price behavior is a small task. Good luck and keep us posted on your progress! Glad to have you here!

My 20-day journey. Day 2. GER40: Moved SL to BE halfway to target. Stopped out at BE+. No appetite for a second attempt for a short trade. (first trade was a fingerslip lol). SP500: Closed manually after being satisfied with the profit (or getting anxious) when price was going my way. I sometimes read Fridays are not the best days to trade. Hence my small targets and SL levels, also because I am a conservative trader by nature. Have a nice weekend.

Thoughts,,,, I'm not a fundy guy but I cant be blind to the news... Inflation came out higher this morning.. Intuition tells me...seems bearish,, But no matter what my intuition says I have to trade the chart not feelings and intuition. Looking back at the last few weeks ,,going fwd I am scaling down my ORB entries to a single contract. I have no problem adding into a trade based upon PA...so that's what I will do.. I have been using up to a 15 pt initial stop which is my max comfort level...and I have found it's just too much with 2 contracts..as it has affected me... Today was 15 pts approx 1.5xATR initial entry. My strength lies in adding on to winners. So will stick with that and scaling up... Most initial entries on the ORB will fail and around 1 day a week they wont and take off in one direction... Those I can add to... Today initial ORB long stopped out -15 $1500 ORB short +24.5 on 2c +16.25 on the 1c addition $3237.50 Gross $1700ish Todays chart..observe the levels and PA around them. MeBob came thru like a shining star !!!! Congrats to all that took these setups...Execute and manage your trades/manage yourself... Cheers Blue Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Blue, thanks for sharing this Info and teachings. Regarding the entries, the entries are on the signal candle close, right. I am asking since PA like today is quite fast and I am entering manually therefor my reaction time is not that fast and I am entering at the candle low. Also when we see a MEBOB signal candle still inside the 5 Min OR, than I guess we give the MEBOB signal candle the priority regardless of the 5 Min OR? Finally, when you talk about the 2 PM ( 4 hr ) candle, do we still check, consider the 5 Min OR and MEBOB entry ranges? Also a big thank to Vidvad for starting this and all the rest of the experienced traders to share the knowledge with the newbies like myself. Have a great weekend. Cris.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Csierra.. Yes the entries are on the close of the signal candle... What I do is I have a clock so I can monitor the last few seconds and either enter or sometimes price may retrace quickly at the last second and then you again wait... I use a large digital clock...so I can easily see without directly taking my eye of PA... So you really need to be present at the moment and ready to strike right at the close and subsequent open... As the ticks do add up. If I'm trading the ORB I am going with that signal first and foremost..and will use PA to manage the trade... If Mebob opens and I get an opposite signal then again I am simply using PA to manage. I will take a look thru the charts and see if I can provide an example As for the 2pm observations... That is not part of Mebob or the ORB,,,,it's simply just a my personal observations... I may post more on that over on the Flying Dutchman thread so as to not distract from this thread. Stick to a short window...rather than trying to trade a whole session. So as to stay focused as possible Hope that helps..
