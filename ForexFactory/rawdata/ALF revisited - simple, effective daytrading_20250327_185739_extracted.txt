Why a new thread?

1. The original (over 1000 posts) is too long - discouraging for new participants.

2. The ALF method is herein improved and simplified. It will be more effective over different timeframes without the need to modify indicator settings.

Currency Pair And Timeframe:

Any pair, any timeframe.

What is ALF?

Adaptive Laguerre Filter - an indicator created by John Ehlers . It is a superior overbought/oversold tool. There is a free technical paper at Ehlers' website  entitled "Time Warp Without Space Travel" which you may download if you really want to know the gory details.

A few thread requests:

Let us refrain from discussing repainting - nothing I post here repaints any candle other than the current one. Period.

Some who followed the original thread will want to try comparing the TVI candles from that thread to the Fractal Candles introduced here. Go ahead, but please don't post screenshots of comparisons in this thread.

Entries, Exits, and Stops:

Entry Guidelines:

Best to trade with the prevailing trend (if there is one). Look at ALF - if it is significantly higher now than it was at the left side of the chart, trend is up, vice-versa for down. If it is about the same, market is ranging.

Do not trade when ALF is flat and PA is cycling back and forth through ALF in a narrow range (20-30 pips or less).

Enter on an open above/below ALF. PA should be appearing to pull away (or peel away) from ALF with candle range increasing over prior bars. The only exception to this is a large one-candle move through ALF - best to ambush this and not wait for the candle to close.

Stop Guidelines:

A few pips on the opposite side of ALF is generally a good place to set stops.

Exit Guidelines:

There are 3 possibilities.

1. PA re-connects with ALF. This is a good exit for trades in which ALF bends in the direction of the trade.

2. A candle of another color. An optional exit for shorter trades when ALF does not begin to follow PA.

3. Because you have a "feeling" about the trade, or the market is jumpy, you have gained 10-15 pips and would like to keep it.

What is Fractal_Candles_SR_v3 and what is it measuring?

Go here http://ta.mql4.com/indicators/bills/fractal or read Chapter 8 of "Trading Chaos" by Bill Williams - support and resistance as delineated by Williams Fractals is what Fractal_Candles is measuring. There are no moving averages involved - only Price Action.

Bars are colored based on the direction expected by the indicator. When bars are not colored they may be thought of as "wait and see" bars. Use common sense with these, however, and don't turn a win into a loss.

Indicators and template posted below:

Download and copy ALF.ex4 and Fractal_Candles_SR_v3.ex4 to the yourmt4/ experts/indicators folder and ALF_SR.tpl to the yourmt4/templates folder.

If you find this thread to be interesting and helpful, don't forget to vote for it - not to gratify my ego but to attract more participants.

Alert Indicator added:

I've added ALF_Alert.ex4 to the attached files. Included are an email option and the facility to change the text of the alert messages. There are also arrows which (optionally) appear when an alert is sent. The arrow colors are also user-definable.

Lou. I am sure this will be a great thread.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
yeah thanx Lou ! look realy good at history  demo test tommorow

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Looks pretty much like the original method - but it's not. It's better.

Try the TF of your choice...

--- 帖子 #5 ---
like it. Looks yummy on H1 TF. Will eyeball M15...may be better.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thx to you LouG

--- 帖子 #7 ---
These are points of ambiguity (retracements or outright reversals) in PA - can be used as exits if you choose to do so.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
... alone and not wait for cross of ALF?

Sure, if you are feeling adventurous

Put in some screen time first to get a feel for when this will work to your advantage.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Is it the same indys or new and improved ?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
ALF.ex4 is the same - ALF_Candles.ex4 is new and improved.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Can I post this version? I've added a shift para so it can be shifted right....

.....helps to keep in the trade that little bit longer

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Does it really make that much difference? I assume it must work for you. I have no real objection but I always like to see the method tried as is before  introducing modifications...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
after how much research did you determine that,"staying in the trade that little bit longer," is good? Or is it just a gut feeling? Gut feelings in this business fill the threads here at FF and will make you broke in very short order.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
We have to wait for the candle to close for entry on color.

That's right?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
It can work, not all the time its needed so you can set it at 0

For me I like certain amount of pips a day not to trade all day so for me I don't to keep giving away to the spread for entry again and again just cuz it crossed by a very small amount. I use 3LWMA stead of just candles and take the cross of that and ALF.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Maybe - depends on the range of the candle and how active the market is. This is a judgment call - I would not wait for a 20-30+ pip candle to close before jumping on board. You can always exit with a small loss if PA turns against you...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Saw your post on the original thread - astounding results!

Check this chart - month of May using the ALF_Candle on H4:

--- 帖子 #18 ---
very hard not to make money trading Euro. However,witness the GBP results to understand the importance of diversity. I am convinced that ALF needs but very little filtering to be traded profitably...There are limits to the extent to which we can refine our entries/exits. We are working with a discontinuous function. I believe these limits are approachable by the simplest of techniques...As we do...We buy when price is going up. We sell when price is going down. The rest is up to the idiosyncrasies of PA, and trade mgt. Pippo ps. The,"Month of Trades," posted in orig. thread produced about 465 pips. May result is no fluke, IMHO.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi Lou,

is the short EURUSD on 15 min a valid entry? I guess the time of day is not ideal, but I enetered short on the break of previous low of 1.2258.

Eddie

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi. I'm new to this, can you please post some screenshots with enter/exit points. Thank you

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Time of day is not ideal but it appears to be working out okay - don't expect huge profits, absent news to drive PA.

ALF_Candles will keep track of S/R for you so no need to second-guess it.

At first sign of reversal, grab the pips and get out...

See chart below - all good entries:

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Stick around - if this thread is anything like the first one, there will be many examples.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
This one I will follow from the beginning!  Count me in Lou.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
True enough - Euro in May was like the fish in the proverbial barrel. Still, we shall see what happens if no more EU member nations go belly up...

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I took rofit at +10 pips. Where can i 'learn' a bit more about PA or will that only come with screentime?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Lou, how do the candles keep track of S/R?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I do not see any ALF candles on my chart which has black background, only the ALF line, any body knows why?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Basically, with screen time but there are many books and articles on the subject. Google "Japanese candle interpretation" - you'll get a ton of results.

Looks like your trade was eventually good for 20+ but I am certainly not second-guessing you - 10 pips is always good...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
See post #1 - download and copy the indicators and template as directed. Then put the template on your chart from the icon on the right end of the MT4 toolbar.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Everyone always wants to know what's up the magician's sleeve

Basically, by analyzing Bill Williams fractals as they develop, the indicator can infer price action. Best to read chapter 8 of the book suggested  in post #1 but you can find a good explanation by googling "williams fractals".

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Lou,

Was with your prior thread from the beginning and really liked the way you managed that, just so straight forward. I am looking forward following this revisited thread and will reread a bit from "Trading Chaos" by Bill Williams (that's been a while). I have not been so great at posting charts myself, see if with the start of this new thread can change that!

Great to see you back so soon again!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
In post #21 one of the red ALF candles referred to as a good entry closed above ALF. I thought a red close below ALF was needed for a qualified short entry.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
It's actually possible to anticipate the ALF cross with the new indicator and get away with it, believe it or not.

Still, your point is well-taken. I should stay with a more conservative approach until everyone gets on track

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Tell us something about re-entry Lou G

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks for the work you are doing on this thread, Lou.  Simplicity is hard for most humans... we tend to over complicate things... Your advice to put in the screen time and to be patient is the best advice anyone could give.

ALF is amazing...

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Are you saying that, if the candle is either red or green, there is no need to look at support and resistance levels? Or am I misunderstanding?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
See the chart. Entry at down arrow, exit at the X (or when next bar shows green), re-enter at the down arrow as shown. A similar pattern occurs twice more in subsequent bars.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Excellent upgrade...way to stay with the project...Look forward to your continued posts as well as those of others as this thread progresses...
Took a little trade during off hours after I got home from work...played out further than 6 pips but I was scalping after all...
Great addition to the candles...
Thanks much...
Cliff

--- 帖子 #39 ---
M15 trade...I have added my fetish...6 pd. Price Channel to help decide PA.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
You are not misunderstanding - the indicator does look at S/R levels and candles will change color when the levels are breached.

Color change also occurs at reversal and retracement points.

Put the attached indicator on your chart - it's a huge clue to how ALF_Candles does what it does.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Excellent trade...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Another good one...

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Can you provide me that fetish?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Type,"Price Channel," into search function at top of page.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
"Trading Chaos" is his best, IMHO.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Why didn't you go short on the bar previous to your long entry?  Red bar breaking down through the ALF line.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
In fact, the Short was two bars prior to the Long entry and was a loser. My intent was simply to show that great +.0177 win.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks.  You did have an outstanding trade!  However, my problem is that I probably would have taken the short.  I guess the thing that the long had going for it was that it broke previous highs while the short didn't break previous lows.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I also would have taken this trade. I just can't seem to recognize good trade signals with this system. I keep seeing a lot of signals turning into losers. Or maybe I'm missing something here... Too bad for me!

Great pips to everyone!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Normally I wait for a break of PC before entering. On occasion, I don't. We'll see how these new S/R candles work out.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Already done that, too much results and no indicator, I don't want to be "off topic" but I would like that indi for another system, can you attach it please?

Best regards

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Why is it a problem if you did take the short? Looks like a small loss, which is then more than offset by a 177 pip win.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
lol

type Price Channel in serarch

go to first found thread and 21 post

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Here...Trading Discussion...Price Channel Trading...post#21.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
To you I say the same as I just did to tbone - your wins will exceed your losses. I know you must also have seen the signal Pippo refers to - 177 pips is HUGE.

Be patient, people! Put in that screen time that I continually rant about and all will become clear.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks Lou.  I understand.  My problem is I probably would have stayed in the short too long making it a larger loss and missed the long entry...  :-(

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Much whipsaw around the blue line. If all you do is go short on a red candlestick below the blue, and long on a green candlestick above, you get whipsawed badly.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks Lou for this simple system.

My question what is the initial SL you use for say 15m, 30m TF or you be in front of your screen and use your discretion?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
At times that's true. In the original thread I made a point of cautioning members to avoid trading when ALF is horizontal and PA is in a small trading range. I have not mentioned that here yet only because most of the folks posting here were also a part of the earlier thread but I will get around to it in fairly short order.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thank you!

Just took a 22 pips trade, new order open at trendline break. What do you guy's think about the entries? I'm looking for 20 pips +  spread for now. Not the bets time to trade, but it felt good.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
A propos this observation, in May, the method referred to in post #1092 in orig. thread had 31W/41L for about 43% win pctg. and scored nearly 2200 pips. We are probing for profitable excursions...nothing more.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I've used a 20 pip stop on M15 for quite a while with good results - I can't suggest what to use for other TFs.

Ideally, stops should be placed just above/below the last PA turning point but should not exceed 1-2% of account balance. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
to the author of the thread

Thank you, you are doing a great job

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Looks good to me - terrible time of day to trade most of the time but very lively today for some reason.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
.. from Dreamliner (a few posts back).

DO NOT trade when ALF is flat and PA looks like this. Wait for PA to "peel away" from ALF.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I see two miniscule losses. IMHO, they will be dwarfed by correctly managing the trades that do,"follow through." Newbies, when things are uncertain, Lou's commentary should be considered the primary source of reference. He generously allows me to pontificate away without reprisal.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
So are you suggesting to take every trade? I'm not opposed to that, just wondering if that is what you are saying. If you take every trade, you are saying the trends will overcome the ranges, correct?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I rember looking at this problem when the orig. thread began. I think losses were about 1/3 size of winners, so 1W/3L, 25% is about b/e. I am quite sure merely Long above/Short below, with only a catastrophic SL had a positive outcome. IMHO, it is not the best way to trade using these tools. I wait for a break of 6 pd. Price Channel to confirm entry. Lou's method of waiting for PA to peel away from ALF before entering may be better, but I've traded with Price Channels for so long I am loathe to give them up.This method is very straightfoward, but not mechanical.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Makes sense. Have you posted your price channel somewhere?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
In addition, the desirability of trading with the larger trend has not been mentioned here (yet), although it was mentioned often in the original thread. We'll get there soon, I'm sure.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Sorry - downloaded the template and the 2 ex4s. Loaded the template but don't see the blue line??? Did I not read the post properly? What is the Blue Line - I assume MA but what period?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
The blue line is a Adaptative Laguerre Filter (ALF), not a moving average. Make sure you placed the indicators on the right folder, the indicators folder inside experts, on your platform directory.

By the way, my last trade hit tp, then I made one short and in 5 minutes I banked another 20 pips.

No more trades for today, it time to have dinner!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Here it is.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
How do you use it with the current indicators?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I don't actually use it, its not my "fetish". I just started to use this system so I'm not the best person to ask questions. Try Pippotamus, maybe he can help you.

Best regards, Orcinus

--- 帖子 #76 ---
This could be a good idea for people who keep taking trades where they are getting whipsawed getting into a play too early, by using this channel you want to make sure the signal candle touches the top band for long or bottom band for short.. much flat action and whip can be avoided as such.

Brian

--- 帖子 #77 ---
This system is an even improved version, fantastic, but wondering since its such a long previous thread maybe you can answer, what was that pip count based on?

Just want to know basic, time frame and what pairs were used for that total?

If you can do that or better with such a simple setup... it may be worth further pursuit?

Brian

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Update: LOL, just re-read first post again. Still, my recommendation on

a simple start would be to alert on ALF candle color change, not white

or black just long or short candle color change as an easy start.

RE:

Just one more..would it be possible to have a simple alert added to

the new ALF candles?

Could be alert on color change, that's easy to go check

or on price crossing ALF, but the color change would cover

more situations and could be on the closed bar.

Brian

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks Lou. I had placed the ALF Candles but missed the ALF.ex4. I knew it was a simple oversight...thanks again.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Lou, very nice addition! I love these tools that you have shared with us.

The thing I would say is that you have to be somewhat keen on price action. If you are in an up trend and you get a short signal, use some discretion, you do not have to try to milk every pip out of the market. If that short does turn into a reversal, then keep your eye on the pullback (most of the time there is one).

However, at the rick of vacillating, you can pretty much take most (valid) signals, trend and countertrend a like. But you have to TAKE them. You will get losers in every system. However hit the next signal. If you finish up for the day, then you shouldn't worry about the little loss you incurred on your way to a profitable day.

These tools are killer, but it still comes down to knowledge of price action, proper trade management and confidence in the system you are using.

You learn these things with these tools, in my opinion, is the closet thing to any sort of grail that you are going to achieve.

Thanks again Lou for the new tool. I will still keep my M1 system as is (TVI Modified, again profitable today), but I will definitely use this with M5 and higher.  I look forward to posting the ALF SR trades on here.

Lots of losers tonight, whipsawing like crazy.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
It's pretty crazy tonight, just banked 8 pips or so closing almost all my position, moved stop to be and got 1 pip profit with the remaining.

One quick question, what pairs do you guys usually trade with ALF?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
What pair(s) and time frame was causing you the trouble tonight?

Brian

--- 帖子 #86 ---
What time frame you on Dreamliner??  I stick with EU on 15 min.  Also I know people don't want to load this down with indicators but I use Support and Resistance [Barry].  Don't know how to attach but search site and you will find it.  Keeps me out of some whipsaws.  20 Pips a day and my yacht will be called the Lou G

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I'm doing just fine on the EURUSD. 20 more pips banked. I decided to enter after the retrace as the support had been broken. Maybe another one is coming, let's see...

--- 帖子 #88 ---
You can tell how powerful the ALF line is as S/R level the way price pulls back and tests it and bounces. Great system to use MTFs.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Took this quick scalp.. on GU entry was bit early still gave me 20 pips ..

Hi, Lou,

I would like to be able to change your default color and width settings on the ALF Candles Indicator and would be grateful if you could make that adjustment.  I like the flexibility that would allow. Since I usually use lime green up candles and red down candles, your medium sea green and red with 5 width shows little or no contrast.

Thanks,

Raymond

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Propably the best timeframe for EUR/USD intraday trading is m15, it's nice and has a lot of good setups. M5 is too small and too noisy, m15 gives you at least 3-4 setups during london open-close.

Well, I know very well that m15 is not good for 'forex quick gunners' - but be patient for a signal, patience and discipline (and cool mind) are a keys to profits. Two years ago I was a 'forex quick gunner m1-m5' too, it always ends to me with 'shooting down' all deposit

Best regards, J.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Sorry, but I wouldn't go that far to say what's best or not. I guess it's more like what suits an individual. Looking at past data for the London session (or part of it) there are plenty of days that would have been great on a 15min interval and even so there would have been range or fast days very rough to trade. The same is true for other timeframes as well, except that a 15min range could be (not necessarily though!) a very nice day to trade the 5mins. And yes a choppy fast day on 5min could have been much easier on 15min!

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Well, you're right in fact. Every trader has it's own style, system and timeframe

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I know people dont want to clutter up with indicators but

I just want to offer a suggestion for people who are having

trouble with whipsaw

1. Pay attention to PA first

2. Use the pricechannel, I really like that

and have used it many times before, it can

definitely help

3. I could recommend 5 great things individually

to do from using one really good volume indicator

to languerre set at 0.7, but find one thing that

works for you to confirm the moves, until with

it you have success after success, then consider

removing the extra aid if you wish.

4. Use M15 if you are having trouble with

M5.

All the best

Brian

--- 帖子 #95 ---
You can change the colors and width to whatever you like:

press ctrl+i, highlight indicator in the box, click edit, click the inputs tab and change the settings...

--- 帖子 #96 ---
That works for the red and green colors, but how do you change the wick (and black candle) colors? I like a black background on the charts, so would need to change black to something else. Tried changing all the black colors to white but nothing happened.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
My primary trading hours are from 12:00gmt-16:00gmt (the overlap of London/New York) so I will always be here to answer questions and comment on your posts during that time.

During the next day or two I plan to address entry, stop and exit guidelines. I will write an individual post for each topic and also create a new section in Post #1 reiterating the same info so that Post #1 will always contain all pertinent information.

I'll also post "textbook" trade setups as they appear, primarily for winning trades because I don't think showing losing trades is helpful (though I may also post a loser or two).

I trade the EU exclusively but, as was demonstrated by many in the original thread, ALF works equally well with any pair - there were even a few good trades posted by a member who was trading oil futures.

I try to respond to all questions/problems so, if I do not respond immediately to a post, have patience - I'll get to it.

Consider this post a blanket "you're welcome" to all who have thanked me for my efforts - if you are following this thread, I do appreciate your participation.

Like most other indicators, the LaGuerre signals are issued on derivations of price movement, and, as such, are essentially useless, unless you aim to go broke. This method is based on PA. Fractals, Price Channels,Trend Line breaks, are thematic. Indicators based on derivations of price are not. The LaGuerre does not belong here.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
... so far today. Try dropping down to M5 on days like this and lowering your profit expectations.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Thanks! Didn't even occur to me that the alf candle color could be changed with regular candle color settings. Thought it all had to be done on the indicator settings.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I KNOW how to change indicator settings!  Been doing it for years!

With your indicator, for which I commend you, the new settings do NOT stick!  They revert back to YOUR default settings each time I try to change them and save the template! Would you please post the .mql file for it which we may then also insert into our "...expert/indicators" file along with the .exe file, which will then allow us to change your default indicator settings.

Thanks,

Raymond

Absolutely no profit to be made on the 15 min timeframe this morning, way too much whipsaw, unless you're setting profit targets and stop losses.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Do not trade when ALF is flat and PA is cycling back and forth through ALF in a narrow range (20-30 pips or less).

Enter on an open above/below ALF with corresponding candle color. PA should be appearing to pull away (or peel away) from ALF with candle range increasing over prior bars. The only exception to this is a large one-candle move through ALF - best to ambush this and not wait for the candle to close.

I've marked 5 good entries on the chart below, 3 wins, 2 losses. This method is not 100% mechanical - pattern recognition is essential, thus my continual references to "screen time". Wait for good setups.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
RE: the chart in Post #108:

A few pips on the opposite side of ALF is generally a good place to set stops.

Stops for retracements may need to be handled differently - I'll dig into that in a separate post.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Lou, I am wondering if an offset to ALF would helpful to determine when to enter, and when to stay out? Perhaps a percentage of ATR might do. Currently ATR14 on E/U M15 on IBFX is .0023. For example, offsets of .0023 above and below ALF could serve as entry filters. EDIT: May serve as SL values as well.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Note the overall downtrend at this time - the last two moves of ALF are down with lower highs. Not a good time for a long trade.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
This may turn out well:

--- 帖子 #112 ---
25-30 pips taken. Note long wicks, trade flattens out...

--- 帖子 #113 ---
RE: previous trade:

Essential to stay alert in jumpy markets - take a reasonable profit when it appears. This trade was good for minimum 10-15 pips, more if you were paying attention...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I took +11 in the same trade.

Thanks once again

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Good call - candle just went red again so possible re-entry - I did not take it.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
RE: the current EU M5 chart:

A good time to talk about exits. There are 3 possibilities.

1. PA re-connects with ALF. This is a good exit for trades in which ALF bends in the direction of the trade.

2. A candle of another color. An optional exit for shorter trades when ALF does not begin to follow PA.

3. Because you have a "feeling" about the trade, or (as in today's case) the market is jumpy, you have gained 10-15 pips and would like to keep it.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Right with you.  Took +22 pips

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Nice going. This is a tough day - no news to push things so take what the market gives you.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
... officially over as PA/ALF meet. 1.2207 - 1.2193 equals +12 pips net spread, much more if you were on the case as it was happening.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Took 25pips with u LouG but on 15m.

Still looking both old and new for now.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
+25 is good. You will gain confidence as you compare old/new - new is better

Share your M15 chart to help others.

Anyone confused about that last trade, speak up...

--- 帖子 #122 ---
If you are long at 1.2201 or so, I can't blame you - it looks good. Candle went green at that price.

Those more conservative will wait for an upturn in ALF to indicate a trend change.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I am long now but I plan to take only +5 this time.

Long was counter-trend, IMHO - I did not bite, but those who did should do no worse than break even.

+5 is smart...

Thanks very much for bringing us this simple and great system!!

Just curious about black/white bars? what's their indication/meaning?

thanks!

See post #7

Normally, I trade right up to the London close (90 minutes from now) but I'm officially hanging it up for today.

I will do a daily postmortem at 16:00 gmt...

Speaking of which, all references to the time of bars will be GMT - if your broker's server differs from this, be sure to calculate the offset so we can all be on the same page with bar references...

I'm using windows 7 and ODL metatrader

since saving the ex4 (x2) and the template files - odl metatrader keeps crashing

i have saved to the correct location(s) - any advice please?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I have now removed the 2 x EX4 files - and metatrader works fine

Are there any incompatibilty issues with these EX4 files?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi all,

Just a suggestion to consider for exits for the ones that maybe not always have a good pa feeling (like myself). I use a combination of pivot lines and fibo expansion. Fibo expansion you can find under "insert". I put my initial target a few pips below/above a pivot line that suits me, so it doesn't have to be the first one. After the entry I will add the fibo expansion from the last swing h/l to the point of entry and will use the 161.8 level as the point to either a: use as target (so change the initial target) or use as point to change the stop to BE.

This exit strategy has nothing to do with the original thread and can be used with whatever trading strategy you use. It works for me and I hope it will help others. Still this exit strategy has a little discretion in it, so be careful and follow your own thoughts!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
None reported. If you are absolutely positive that the ex4s were in the correct folder, you might want to google "mt4 windows 7 problems" and see if anyone has mentioned trouble.

One good trade today - 12:25 GMT, M5 EU short at 1.2207, profit between 12-30 pips depending on your trade management skills.

Not a bad day but not a good one either, just okay.

Shift your chart to D1 and notice the triple bottom forming - could this be the end of the downtrend? We'll see...

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Can you post couple of your winning charts? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Well, time to be sure ex4s were in this folder:

yourmt4/experts/indicators

where "yourmt4" is the name of the folder where your broker has installed MT4.

Template goes in yourmt4/templates (NOT yourmt4/experts/templates).

My first ALF trade.  Although pretty flat action I saw more buyers than sellers...nice set up +21 for this trade. Cant wait for more pips...

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Nice work.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I think i like this method. Second trade +10. So two trades +31 for the day. I thank the author...Lou great stuff..

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I'm liking what I see and how simple the method seems.

I'm looking forward to forward testing this.

What other times of day has this been used successfully on?

MM

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Best used between 08:00 - 16:00 GMT. Some days the Asian open (00:00 - 04:00 GMT) is good as well - I usually check it to see if there is activity.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I would imagine that the session traded would correlate to the pair that should be traded, i.e. jpy crosses for asia, gbp and eur crosses for london, etc...

Time will definately tell

MM

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Thanks Lou,

Very nicely done, and looks like something we can all understand!

I would love to see more detail on exit strategy (my typical nemesis).

Thanks again for putting in so much time.

Happy pipping...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi Lou!

Could you please tell me why you entered on the first down trade?  I see that it's a red candle (close to ALF), but it looks like it initially may have started out green and then turned red.  Could you please clarify this entry for me?  TIA!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
HI Lou,

Took this short, however, ALF was still pointing upwards. (which I only realized after entering)

Will you regard this as a valid trade?

Rgds

Eddie

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Personally, I wouldn't trade that setup, at least not at that point. But as you can see, there's a divergence on the RSI, a lower high on the chart wish as not been corresponded by the indicator. And besides that on the next candle I would had taken that trade, pa moved away from ALF and had the right colour (also confirmed by my RSI).

Don't mind about about my RSI, it is my "fetish" and off topic, it's something personal.

I took the long after that, let's see what happens...

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Just banked 10 pips, closed half and moved stop to be and some more pips, one or two. Got stoped, with profit.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
so what does white and black bars mean? are they signal for a change, or for exit/entry too? and what is the best way with this system for an exit point?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
This method seems to work late NY at least for today its a little slower but still managed to pull out +15 net on this long trade....I do agree ny/london overlap is much faster with better moves...

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I think Post #7 has the answers about black and white candles...

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Not sure how LouG exits but I am looking for previous support or resistance or on a m5 i may look for 10-20 pips...but i just used this method today for +46 pips on three trades so Im no expert...

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Glad Im not the only late NY trader here...

--- 帖子 #153 ---
nice 689 pip spike on fxdd

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I hope you were on the right side of the move or that you had your seatbelt on. What could cause such spike???

Just wondering if most are using this on m5 and on eu exclusively?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
bpips...mostley EU for me...

Cliff

--- 帖子 #157 ---
thanks for mentioning post #7. read over it  i just started too (trief the older ALF system once before), i use it on m5 EUR/USD too. i also added CMO indicator to see tops and bottoms

--- 帖子 #158 ---
It would have been non-red for a few pips until it surpassed the preceding low when it would have become red. That would have been the entry point.

One of the things in my job jar is to implement split candles (bi-colored) to show actual entry points but it's lower in priority than a few other things.

Actually that example wasn't a part of a live trade - I just happened to pick that part of the chart to illustrate pullbacks/re-entries.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
thank cliff, think i will stay with eu for now heck 20-40 pips a day is good enough for me.

What is the CMO indicator not familiar with that one?

thanks again

Lou, i'm gradually becoming far more adept at reading the charts and familiarizing myself with patterns. Thanks for the tips, system and advice!

very much appreciated!

20-40 pips with good MM is all i need a day, and your guides have made this quite attainable.

Cheers Mate!

does this work on other pairs besides eur/usd?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Lou.

I have been trading with the old setup and just came accross to the new forum, from where I have downloaded the new indicators and template.

My problem is that I cannot get the new Alf and new Alf Candles to show in the custom indicators list after placing the files into the indicators file. The new template shows in the template folder but when put on a chart only shows the grey and white candles.

I am experienced in MT4 applications, so all steps were correctly taken. I have tried to put on 3 separate broker platforms, all with the same result. Any idea what is causing this problem?

Many thanks for continuing and improving your excellent forum and system.

newbie question: what is "PA" in the chart? thanks.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
PA=price action

price action

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Close the platform and restart it. They shouid show if you have saved in the correct folder i.e. mt4/experts/indicators.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I spent the last 15 minutes trying different TF's to see what looks the most tradeworthy. Guess I'll stick with M15 for now.

As everyone knows, tomorrow is NFP day (my least favorite trading day). I probably won't place many trades today or tomorrow but will be hanging around to answer questions...

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Not a bad way to trade in such a jumpy market...

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Sure, and so was the long before that.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
... coming in 20 minutes. I'll wait and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
... has everyone who has had platform/indicator issues gotten them resolved?

I hate seeing a post that says "the indicators don't appear" followed by a half dozen members riding to the rescue, followed by .......... nothing!

If you are having trouble getting the setup working, speak now.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Lou G, do you look/trust to see what effect the news has on the market by price action, or do you try to follow a gut instinct?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
i.e., if the news is not favorable to the USD, would you trust an initial surge upward beyond ALF?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Sort of gut instinct, based on a few years of watching my stops being taken out on NFP day only to have the trade turn good a moment later...

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I posted some entry guidelines in Post #1

This is an example of when not to trade:

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Here's one that I'm in right now, up a few pips. Nice confluenece between the different TF's.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
The two indicators posted below are the ones I used to develop the ALF_Candles indicator. They will help you understand why the indicator colors the candles the way it does.

The diamond shapes are Williams Fractals - the lines connecting them are therefore assumed to be S/R levels.

Note that when the indicator sees the first half of a fractal, it assumes that an actual fractal will occur (until proven otherwise). This is why the S/R lines track trends closely when they occur and remain the same when PA reverses.

At a fractal point one of two things will happen - PA will reverse or continue in the previous direction. ALF_Candles attempts to anticipate PA based on this behavior. It's not always right (what is?) but it's right a lot of the time, which is all we need to make pips.

Try not to post trades using these indicators - I'd like to keep the presentation of the method as simple as possible - but use them as much as you want to understand how ALF_Candles works.

Have fun...

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Out with +20

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Candle turned red at the line - enter there and see what happens

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Nice method. Thanks Lou. Bagged some nice Pips on the EU M15 short. The price action on EU seems to work well with this. If you can hang through the retraces back to the ALF line it usually continues in the direction of the break... so IMHO you have to be patient with it and let the trade develop. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Nice trade - a bit hard to read the charts though, even when they are expanded...

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Exit when the candle turns green - +25-30 pips - you can always re-enter if this turns out to be a retracement...

--- 帖子 #194 ---
it's a multiple monitor setup, so ff doesn't do it justice with the attachments.

Edit: Resized images in post 189.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
... curving up/down, it is busy deciding where parity is between overbought/oversold. eventually it will find that point, PA will cross and we'll start over again.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Has everyone with questions read the Entry, Exit and Stop guidelines in Post #1?

The exit from my previous trade exemplified Exit Guidelines 2 and 3:

I felt that 25-30 pips was enough for right now (guideline 3) and candle went green (guideline 2).

Speak up if you don't get it - we'll kick it around some more.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Lou,

On your last trade, did you enter when the first candle turned red below the ALF? Or, did you enter on the third candle, after price went back up to the line and came back down?

Just trying to get a better sense of how you're seeing things.

Been profitable thus far, thanks for your efforts!

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hey lou, +85 today using the old indies on m30.  I have a question: can the settings on alf candles be changed?  I am using 5/12/12 on the old indie, I don't see the settings on the new one.  thanks.

fw

--- 帖子 #199 ---
See post #192 - entry when the candle turned red (below support). Had you entered two bars earlier (on M15) a 20 pip stop just above ALF would have been enough to save the trade.

Glad you're being profitable...

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Nope - that's the advantage. I have freed myself from the tyranny of fixed periods. The new indicator responds only to PA, which is why your chart can now be shifted between TF's without tinkering with settings.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
A very good case for using these tools.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Lou

If I missed this forgive me.  I know there is no repainting issues with candles.  You say when candle turns red enter short.  If in same candle price moves back up won't current candle change back to different color?  I guess what I'm saying is that you don't wait for candle close

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Yes, that can happen - it's the nature of Forex. PA can always turn against you. That's where vigilance and trade management enter the equation.

If you are in profit and get that "bad feeling", take some pips and run.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Here's a good example of a possible retracement using the previous short trade (still in progress).

If you entered at the first blue arrow, you have a small profit but it's in jeopardy.

Better to wait and see if the candle indicated by the second arrow goes below support and turns red.

Or, assuming you entered as mentioned, take the +10-15 and close it out - your choice.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hello Lou G,

I don't have the same colors, I don't know why. And as colors are important to decide whether or not to enter...

Here is my chart on EUR/USD 15m using Alpari UK.

Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Different brokers will give you different feeds, not all brokers are created equal.

So pick your poison.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
They look the same to me (in the area we're analyzing). Expand your chart one click so the charts are on the same scale...

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Entry short at the open of bar A was legit and would have required a stop >= 18 pips to keep the trade alive (stop just north of ALF).

Entry at bar B when it turned red at 1.2230 was also good.

First possible exit at bar C (exit rule #2) when bar turned green (which it did as soon as it opened) was good for +30 or so.

If you stayed in the trade, the final exit (if PA ever gets there) will be at bar D somewhere in the future when PA and ALF meet (exit rule #1). Note that ALF is currently at 1.2205 so profit cannot be less than +25 if you hang on for the duration.

Is everybody good? If not, speak up - that's why I'm here.

And let's not forget, it could still go lower...

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Looks good.  I re-entered around 2188.  Did you see that also??  Great system.  Thanks for the system and your time.

Mombone

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yeah, the retracement was good as well - nice trading. I'm trying to deal with one thing at a time here since we have members who have varying skill/knowledge levels.

The whole reason for simplifying this method is to make it accessible to the less-experienced while keeping it sophisticated enough for everyone.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thanks for making this example, which makes me understand the system better.

Just curious, what if "C" is a black/white bar, does that make it an exit? what's difference between black and white bars?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
London is closed and my trading is over for today. One trade (examined in exhaustive detail), +30 pips or so. Another okay day.

Those curious about how and why ALF_Candles does what it does, see post #190.

I check in here during non-trading hours so if you have questions or comments, post them.

Lou G

--- 帖子 #213 ---
EURUSD, EURJPY and GBP USD market still look very bearish...anyone still short?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Well, it could be an exit if you are uncertain and want to play it safe. Generally speaking, the non-colored bars are meant to be "wait and see" bars. They are not perfect though, so use common sense and don't "wait and see" yourself into hitting a stop or turning a win into a loss.

That does not completely answer your question, however. The non-colored bars are bars that are moving counter to the direction ALF_Candles thinks they should be.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I wish I was but I try to keep trading hours separate from the rest of my life, sometimes leaving a bunch of pips on the table

... for demo-addicted traders.

I know that this is true because I have done it:

If you are demo-addicted but really want to learn to trade, open a mini account and trade real money. Use 10 cent pips if you have to. Trading only on demo is like playing Monopoly when you aspire to be a real estate investor.

Trading real money changes the game, even if a 20 pip stop represents a risk of $10 or less. You will absolutely do things differently when cash is involved.

IMHO...

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Absolutely and to add to this: be sure to use a broker with a low spread. When you only target at say 15 pips, the lower the spread the better.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Yes - main reason I trade EU.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Use buy, sell and close scripts that you can hot-key to place and close trades.

If you can't find such scripts by searching (but you can) I will post the ones I use (once I modify them - right now they only work on 4 decimal brokers).

--- 帖子 #220 ---
So true Lou, and not to mention it won't do a damn thing for your discipline and patience, which happen to be the 2 BIGGEST needs for trading.

Demo should only be used to get a "feel" for your trading platform, nothing more.

MM

--- 帖子 #221 ---
EDIT: Or, since using scripts will force you to learn how to compile code, use F9 to get into the standard ordering screen, place your order instantly by clicking BUY or SELL and set stop/take profit later by using the MT4 order-modify process. Lots will use the default you have set in Tools/Options/Trade on your MT4 platform.

Either way, the point is to place your order promptly once a decision to trade is reached. Practice doing this on demo (the only thing demo is really good for).

I did exhaustive demo trading, which was somewhat beneficial, but when I started live trading -- that was a completely different experience.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Thank you!

I put "Trading In The Zone" by Mark Douglas on the required reading list for the original ALF thread. That still holds good...

--- 帖子 #229 ---
...an illustration of Exit Rule #1.

PA and ALF meet - +49 pips net spread.

Obviously, this exit rule is only invoked when the price move is long enough to allow ALF to bend with the trade.

Shorter trades need either rule #2 or 3.

Congrats Bbolss!  Could please post a couple of screenshots with your entries?  TIA!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Lou,

For a short trade, are you waiting for the color of the candle to change red in color before entering below the ALF (if candle is peeling/pulling away)?  B/c the candle could start out as black/white and change colors...Right?  TIA!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
ALF_Candles also looks at S/R - better if PA breaks through prior S/R before taking the trade. The color change takes place when S/R is broken.

--- 帖子 #235 ---

This weekend I'm continuing work on ALF_Candles. There are a few small things about it that I'm not totally pleased with.

I'm also thinking about how to handle the alerts - I know this is important to many of you and I am working on it. Not as easy as it seems to find a useful way to do it and not throw an alert when it isn't useful. Be patient...

--- 帖子 #240 ---
checked your system today lou,

and again well layout system. i tried your system today. and i at the moment 100+ pips on eu / usa.

just a matter of time now till it goes under 1.20.

maybe a good idea setting for an alarm is this.

when ALF goes flat dont trade. when ALF goes up or down like 10 degrees or more, give alarm for trade. when ALF reaches again the 10 degrees point. stop trade.

just an idea. dont know it is possible to program, but i think would cover some of the problems?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
My current Aud/Usd trade using these tools. Only this and Aud/Jpy trade remain open. Rest closed at b/e + a few pips for a bottle of wine. I know this is not the standard method as outlined by Lou and will not post any additional such trades if he prefers. I entered on break of Fractal support rather than waiting for candle close.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I only provide the tools. I don't push my way of using them unless I see someone who obviously is not getting it on their own.

You're an experienced trader - do as you see fit and share with the rest when what you do is successful.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Aud trades working out nicely. Breaks of Fractal S/R viv a vis Alf produce stellar entries, IMHO. The Aud/Jpy trade. Will close up shop at 16:00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I'm almost ready to call it quits now (15:30 GMT). The good short move on EU took place before I was awake and then died out. There was a short signal on M15 a few minutes ago but I did not take it because it's Friday and PA will most likely bounce off 1.2000...

No trades for me today.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I mentioned in an earlier post that a few things in the indicator were annoying me - here's the main one. A bar can be both an up and a down fractal at the same time. The indicator needs to deal with that and it isn't - the two black bars following the double fractal should be red, not black.

I'll work on it and fix it by Monday (hopefully).

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I have some minor problems in ALF_Candles that need to be corrected before I get to alerts (what I do to solve Problem A will affect Problem B sort of thing) but thanks for suggesting. I will get to it...

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I don't completely get how candles are produced, or just don't understand the example. I thought a candle turns red as it passes below a current Fractal support level, and vice versa for green. Have the 2 black candles of reference broken fractal support? Looks like the L of large green candle is current Fractal support...getting ready to wipe the egg off of my face. Pippo  EDIT: A closer look at the charts leads me to believe there a gap (yet to be filled) in my understanding of how the candles are produced.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
They do, but they also change color when direction change is possible but has not yet been confirmed by an actual TL break. In the case you mention, an up move has been rejected (temporarily) but there is no nearby support (yet). This is what I'm trying to fix...

--- 帖子 #251 ---
at the risk of being tedious. Isn't the L of large green candle a Fractal? Edit: Have closed my Aud trades for +116, and +89, even though the move looks to still have legs..

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Dumb day for me but not for some others.

Thanks to the posters of winning trades, especially those trading pairs other than EU - keep 'em coming, it helps the newer people.

Those who are struggling - study the above-mentioned winning trades and don't be hesitant to ask questions if you don't get it. It IS gettable (there are enough wins to substantiate that) but we each progress at different rates.

Post losses that you don't understand to the forum (rather than PM me) - many here are better traders than I and will be glad to help...

--- 帖子 #253 ---
In hindsight, I shoulda held the GU trade earlier today, would be up over 70 but being friday I'm not too keen on holding for longer times, especially NFP friday.

But still happy with +15.5.

Do that every day for a couple years with the right MM and you'll be comfortable.

Large green candle is both H and L - that's one of the problems I'm going to work on this weekend.

Nice trades on your part...

EDIT: the fractal support line is working fine - candle goes red as it passes through BUT - the previous three bars should be red also (because the fractal high occurred most recently and was rejected.

Hope that's clear

I posted an improved version of ALF_Candles. See Post #1 - download ALF_Candles_v2.ex4 and install as before.

Improvements:

1.  Corrected handling of fractal candles and double fractals (candles which are both an up and a down fractal). If you have no clear idea of what fractals are, I've added a link to a concise explanation - see Post #1 under the heading "what are ALF candles".

2.  Split candles (2 colors) that show the exact point at which the candle passed through support or resistance.

Normally I would delay posting a revision of this magnitude until I had spent some time testing in a live environment (did the work while the market was closed), but I'm pretty confident with the changes so anyone who wants to beta test this, go right ahead.

I did not update the template, so you may do that on your own if the indicator works properly for you.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
... and would like to trade once a day, check the posted chart with the revised ALF_Candles:

Candles that are completely black/white are stopped out (or a total loss if you are daring enough to trade naked). Candles that show any trace of red/green are wins and the difference between open and high/low is the value of the stop needed to cash in...

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Thanks LouG for the updated candles.  I thought I understood before but this makes it a little more clear.

If I am correct there are two ways to enter one when a candle closes below/above the blue line.

And the second way would be for a candle to break the low or high of a fractal and be either above or below the blue line.

Is it that simple?

I posted what I thought may be two good shorts below the blue line and fractals being broken yellow arrow is entry candle?

thanks again for your work

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Lou G

Please could you clarify the colours for the ALF_Candles v2?

The original ALF_Candles had 5 line indices, which were set with the template as:

0 Black

1 Black

2 Medium Sea Green (width 5)

3 Red (width 5)

4 Black

However, ALF_Candles version 2 has 6 lines

Many thanks for coding some excellent indicators!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Wil try tomorrow, thanks for the update!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Yes, it's that simple. No need to wait for the break of S/R once PA is already above/below ALF, though...

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I needed an extra index buffer to effect the changes. The ones you have identified as Black are actually not black - the arrays are set to DRAW_NONE so they will never appear unless the source code is changed.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I would trade this way if I were adequately capitalized - no more b.s. waiting for news, just place a trade at 00:00 GMT once a day.

I'd have to pull money out of something else but it might be worth it...

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I was reading thru the original thread over the weekend and just wanted to respond to this. If you can't get over the fact that you are gonna leave pips on the table, walk away now before you lose everything. Greed and fear has no place in trading.

It gets me how people will constantly try to pick the top or bottom to the pip. Quit trying, YOU WILL LOSE.

of the week off to a good start, looking for a possible +30, but will bail if it hesitates at previous support @75.10.

Exited 1/2 at 74.933 for +37 at hesitation and moved my stop to 75.10 for a lock of +20 for the rest, but decided to close the last half @ 74.77 when it pulled back for +53 more for a total of 90 pips tonight. Think I'm done til tomorrow. No need to be greedy.

Hi,

I've been following the old thread as well as the new updated one and I would like to thank Lou G for his fantastic work.

I've tried to see if there was any way to filter out some of the bad or range bound trades and while understanding that there is nothing that will ever be able to completely keep you out of these trades, I think I've found something that may help most of the times though.

It's an indicator called NVO (Normal Volume Oscillator). I found it over at the Sonic R thread (so credits go to Sonic and his thread).

Basically how his system uses it is that they don't take trades if the NVO is showing a blue color meaning that there is a low average volume of trades compared to a given time period. However when a signal presents itself and in this instance when the correct colored candle crosses the ALF in a particular direction and the NVO is a color other than blue that usually indicates a very good trade. I've been watching it along with ALF on M15 for that last little while and it seems promising but it will occasionally keep you out of a good trade but overall it seems that it will get you into good trades and more importantly keep you out of most bad trades.

Just my two cents hope it makes sense and helps.

The indicator is posted and I've also posted the guide from the SonicR thread and if you go to page 3 it explains how to read the NVO indicator. On my chart shots I'm using period 768 because it seems that this is good period to be using and some of the participants at the SONICR thread use the M15 timeframe and are using this period as well.

hi Lou

thanx for update ! its very nice idea to paint not all candle !

but i think there is some litle error

switch now to m1 and see

for me it is painting something strange sometimes

check image

best regards

edit

on m5 also have one candle like this

about 1:20 and my broker is gmt-1 if i remembour right

--- 帖子 #281 ---
thanks for the filter but i only see the pdf not the indicator?

Looks like it is promising

Lou,

thanks for opening this thread. I am testing on an IBFS Demo account in 4h TF.   I have a question about the Color tab in the properties of ALF.

# 0 gives me the color I set. What are #1 - #5 used for. Or are they just place holders for now?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi Lou & All

I'm uploading a couple of Screenshots of trades I took this morning. I show where I entered and where I am now after about 30 - 45 minutes.

I try to enter when ALF is either 10+ pips above/below so I'm sure of the direction.

Am I missing something??? Where am I going wrong?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hello MrChips I take eurusd one candle in front of you when black went red and exit with 20pips. May be you wait to much ?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
its strong up trendline thas should be at your chart too  you should not be shorting till this tl is broken

its not 100% mechanical trading remembour

--- 帖子 #288 ---
In the first chart, you simply entered too late. I personally would have entered upon the candle turning red or within a couple pips. Or you could have taken 10 pips but chose not to. Maybe you should shoot for 10 pips until you get a "feel" for the pair you're trading.

As for the EJ chart, there again, simply entered too late. When the market starts to hesitate, look to the left in the chart and see if it's due to S/R and think about a possible exit.

Only time and chart study will clear your eyes, and like Lou says, you'll start recognizing patterns in the market.

We all have losers. We must learn to cut them short.

MM

--- 帖子 #289 ---
... either of the replies you've received could be right. The entry is indeed counter-trend but also a bit late - entry at the arrow with a 20 pip stop and you are still in this trade.

Considering the trend to be up and not taking a short would have saved the loss.

So, which is right? Market appears to be shifting from trending to ranging so perhaps getting in earlier would have been best. Ah, hindsight...

A word about stops - IMHO, stops are not meant to be hit - if the trade turns against you in a meaningful way, exit and live to fight another day,

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I'm not seeing that on my chart but I'll watch for it.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
The only color you can change is shown on the Inputs Tab - the other arrays are not meant to be seen

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Lou,

How do we have to view the new alf candles? Do you wait for a black bar to turn red and a white bar to turn green, or do you wait till the bars close because it can change colors again during it's formation?

Thanks pbb

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I like filters too - ALF is a filter - not sure I need another filter at this time.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thanks for your input. NVO appears to be a good indicator but not something I'd like to add to the method at this time.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Lou if that candle now closed above ALF it would be a good entry right

--- 帖子 #296 ---
@ 1.45341 right after candle turned green. Moved against me roughly 6 pips and had thought about closing it for a loss, but something told me to hold it.

Closed @ 1.4558 for +23.9

Hi Lou

I took the same trade. +10

can you please upload the scripts for putting order.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Everybody with me on this. It's what I saw prior to the last trade.

Didn't really need the trendline though - ALF_Candles told me what to do.

Open below ALF (entry guideline) and take some pips if you can...

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I right there also...

Hi Lou,

i've found this system Friday, i like it very much seams to work very well, thanks.

Those are a couple of trading for today, i'm still learning so, one is good and the other i don't know at this time

--- 帖子 #306 ---
They are supposed to be partially colored - check the explanation of what ALF_Candles_v2 is doing - it's in Post #1.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Very thin soup today. +11 pips on one trade.

The new ALF_Candles_v2 appears to be functioning as it should but I will put in my own "screen time" over the next few days and correct any bugs that show up.

EDIT: I take it back, there IS a small coloring bug on the current bar that appears only occasionally.

It does not appear to be serious enough to pull the plug on the indicator, though. I'll work on it...

--- 帖子 #308 ---
These are the scripts I use for buy, sell and close. Keep in mind that you need to know how to compile them in MT4 if you want to change any parameters - they are scripts, which means they execute on the fly and do not pause to ask for input from you.

Best to set them up as MT4 hotkeys - see MT4 help for how to do this.

Also, they are set up to work with 4 decimal brokers - if your broker is 5 decimal, multiply stop/take profit amount by 10.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Some afternoon pips-sorry i should have removed the rsi i just use it for trend line breaks for a heads up

Lou G my hat is off for you. You have created a wonderful indicator.

At +23 now stopped moved to even holding for 40 pips...great indicator LouG

I'm pleased that so many have had winning trades with the indicator (including myself).

I'm aware that there are some minor coloring problems - rest assured that I will resolve them as soon as I can.

Ain't beta fun?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Amazing that this thread has already grown to more than 300 posts.

If you are new to ALF and have joined the thread at the current post (as all of us have done at some point), please take a few minutes to read Post #1 before asking questions. I'm making a major attempt to update that post with all info necessary to understand and trade th ALF method.

Thanks,

Lou G

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Lou,

thanks for you wonderfull work. i tested the new indicator as well on the AUSUSD on 15 min. chart and made a + 40 pips.

i know your asking why AUSUSd ??? aint that the fun of it

eur/usd is already tested to death here. so i thought lets try it on different one, to see how good ALF really is. fortunate AUS was fighting a losing battle against the USa dollar as shown in picture below. could have jumped earlier. but i had not started AUSUD earlier.

so far it really is good. i really like the new setup of half candles filled. combine that with ALF and it is very hard in not to make pips.

tommorow i am going to check it on other pairs and lets see what the outcome will be then

Thanks again and have a nice day of trading

--- 帖子 #316 ---
You're welcome - I'm glad it's working for you.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Lou, I am really confused with the v2 candle indicator.  Is there any part of the tvi indicator built in to this?  I am still using the indicators from the old thread with success.  I put the new candle indie on and notice that the colors do not correspond with the two color tvi indicator like the old candle from the first thread does.  How do we know we are trading in the direction of the tvi with the new indicator?

thanks for posting the winningest (is that a word?) system on FF

FW

edit:  I suppose after re-reading post 1 I realize that tvi is no longer considered in this version of the system....

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Yes, TVI has been replaced by ALF_Candles_v2.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hey Lou,

Thanks for the new indi.  It is working great, had 98% success with it today using on the EU, GU, AU, and USDCHF.  Stayed on the M15 on all of them.

Pips Smith.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Can someone please explain when to enter a trade with the new candles. I am a little cofused about this. Do we wait till the bar close so the color won't change again or do we enter once we have color confirmation in the trend/alf direction regardless of what the bar close outcom will be? Also, do we wait for a white/black bar to turn green/red or do we also take bars that open green/red? I read all posts and reread post no1, still a little confused.

Thanks pbb

Freddy,

I like your signature.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
today i went in with this sell, actually i dont think it was wise to do. because of the ALF line. normally i would not have taken it. but i did it anyway to see what would happen.

LOU what would you have done in this situation? take it or leave it? since ALF is just coming back. and although the trend was going down.i think this was more a trade of luck.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Lou can talk about his system specifics but you appear to have a valid signal from a multiple top that was rejected with an engulfing neg close candle (closed below prev candle low) so it certainly looked pretty good to me.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi Lou G, I can't download the indicators and the template casue the file type is php not ex4 and tpl. Could you help me?

Nothing has changed on the entry. The candles just help you see market conditions a little better.

As of a minute ago I replaced ALF_Candles_v2 with a new version:

1.  Small bug in coloring current candle fixed.

2.  Split (2 color) candles removed. This "feature" was causing more confusion than it was worth. I thought it was a good idea when I did it but I ended up not liking it either.

Updated version posted below and in Post #1.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
A little speculative - we'll see...

Long as PA crossed ALF.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
The way I did it was start at the original ALF post 1, follow the rules, then move onto the rules in post#1 of this thread.  I trade on the M15 just like Lou and follow the rules the exact same as they are listed.  I had to get a feel for the entry into the trades.  I watch and see the price action (PA) and get a feel when it is starting to move.  I don't normally enter in when PA is stalled.  I trade from 1400-1700 London time.

I follow my own Money management rules.  If I can't afford to loose it, I don't trade it.  I manage the pips, not the dollars.  And I always live to trade another day.

Hope this helps.

Pips

--- 帖子 #332 ---
In retrospect, not a smart trade but I'm still alive. Came 1 pip from stopping out...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I know you have a trade set up where you'll enter a candle when it hasn't closed yet (your ambush comment in first post), is that wise and a strategy you'll carry on with. It just seems too open for an otherwise fairly rigid system.

Your system your rules just thought I'd make the comment........

Quote:

"The market sold a lot of EUR/USD in the 1.1920 area with very little  to show for their efforts. The move by the SNB to buy the cross seems to  be doing more for EUR/USD than for EUR/CHF, where history shows they  will fail… EUR/USD shorts are running for cover now…

EUR/USD is at session highs, running into offers at the 1.1990/00  area. Stops lie in the 1.2010/30 region."

I keep watching these stories, as they reflect sentiment of the market, especially today it seems.

I'd say the consensus is "not a good trading day".

One small loss for me (-12 pips) leaving me about even for the week.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
For me the power of the system is in magical "Fractal Candles", normally it takes at least 2 candles, after the close of swing high or low to form a fractal.

With your magical candles we can try to ANTICIPATE with some degree of accuracy  (higher TF trend confirmation, 200 SMA, SR lines) where the turning point will be .

It is almost like an instant fractal, everybody has to wait for 2 candles.

I don't even trade the EU but if I was trading, here are some of the entries that I be interested in.

watch out for the candle closing below 1.1960

--- 帖子 #348 ---
My normal 15M system was done for the day so I decided to open a demo account and play with this one...(nice work Lou G, and thanks for sharing)

I really like this system on GU and 1M charts.

The ALF line was very simple to follow and by applying a 200 EMA (the usual touch/support/resistance line on 1M charts made 3 quick trades for profit of 58 pips, then pushed my luck about 10 min ago (STAGNANT) for a -5 pip loss

3 nice winners 1 quick loser (my fault not the system)

I see this ALF system as having very good potential on 1M charts.

Also I would suggest only trading this system from 0700 GMT - 1600 GMT

Thanks Lou

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Did anybody pick quick 30 pips, courtsey of Mr. ALF!!!

EU is 1.1926 as I write, never went above 1.1960 after closing below (strong supply line).

--- 帖子 #350 ---
:-)

Although there was money to be made going long the Euro......I would suggest to anyone who is not profitable........trade in the direction of the trend.

Of course there are daily trends, 4 hour trends, hourly trends, and trends on even smaller time frames......but I would suggest traders who are not profitable to choose a higher time frame (I use 4 hour) and trade in the direction of the higher time frame.

This will mean you will NOT be in some good trades........but it also means you will not be in some bad trades.

Trading is about preserving capital.......step one.......don't lose money.....step two.......make money

If you have not accomplished step one.......trade in the direction of the higher time frame........a minimum of the hourly.

How to establish the direction of the trend.....well.....Jacko says....ask a 5 year old......if you do not have one......slap on a 60 minute sma......if it is sloping up....it is an uptrend.....if it is sloping down.....it is a downtrend.....if it is flat......the market is ranging

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hee guys.

Maybe this is a little help to the ones that like to stick to the rules of master Lou G and want it to show on the chart without disturbing the total purpose of the setup.

You can set the 3 major timezones in opening and closing time, as well the color that fits you the best.

Be aware of adjusting to the time your broker handles.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
... so far. Today turned out to be the wrong day to roll out a new version of ALF_Candles.

In replacing the TVI as a supplementary indicator for ALF i had hoped to provide something more flexible for different TF's that would work as well without tinkering. Seems to be working okay in that area.

I learn as much from your posts as you do from mine, often more, so keep 'em coming.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Lou for me those half colored candles worked perfectly for me.

maybe we should not give up on them to fast. if it is alright with you i like to experiment further with it. and post some results in here if that is alright for you.

if not, no problem as well. this is your system after all and your the master behind it.

Hi Lou, once again thank you for your great work! I am still getting used to the split candles, but I do see there benefit.

Are you going to try and make an alarm for the candle close through ALF? This would be a fantastic addition to an already amazing system!

I trade GBP/JPY soley and have good results, have to be very careful of trading times but its very rewarding....

Thanks

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Lou,

The yellow box in the chart of your post# 342 looks like the flexbox indi you developed from another thread you started - correct? It would be great if somehow you can re-program to use as add'l filter for your ALF system. I added it to a chart and found that the box is formed after "x" # of candles, thus making it appear too late to use for current signals.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Well boys, I don't see much to trade with on the EU so far.

Much to choppy to my liking.

When in doubt, stay out !!

Lou G,

Any difference between ALF_candles_v2 (post #1) and Fractal_candals_v2 other than the fractals levels? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Nope.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Just posted the source and executable for Fractal_Candles_SR_v3 (see Post #1).

This is the parent indicator for all current versions of ALF_Candles.

Split candles are a user option on the Inputs Tab and you may see/not see the fractal S/R by tinkering with the Color Tab in the usual way.

Have fun...

--- 帖子 #366 ---
...was able to grab a few pips. A little nerve wracking though.

Drag it over to the indicator panel 2 more times.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
This will not work the way you think - it was covered in the original thread. Multiple indicators in the data window do not show accurate values (although the colors may be correct). Try adding a zero level to each indicator and you'll see what I mean...

Also, TVI has been superseded by ALF_Candles (or Fractal_Candles). Using them together is sort of pointless, IMHO.

I agree. All I have added now is a #Signal_Bars-v7 and changed the time frames from 1 minute to 4 hours, to 5 minutes to daily, and made it small size so it sits at the top right of my chart and I can easily see the longer term trend to trade only in the direction of that. Other than that, I do have the ADX for a quick look to see if its too slow to trade.

I admit to having two other MAs included before. Those just confused things. I have deleted them. The only thing anyone needs is the ALF line and candles.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
In Post #1 of the original thread, I mentioned that I nearly started the thread with ALF alone and no companion indicator.

I still believe that, with enough experience, I will be able to trade with only ALF on the chart.

Fractal_Candles_SR_v3 sure does help, though...

--- 帖子 #383 ---
... with a new template. Also removed deprecated indicators.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I have difficulties grasping the effect and the meaning of the colored candles.

The red and green ones are clear, but can you explain please what the black and white exactly represent?

They seem to come in 4 variations:

completely black

completely white

black in a red candle

white in a green candle

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi Lou, thanks so much for your awesome ALF indicators.

Have been trading with the original setup and only recently spotted the new thread.

Finally read through the lot, so time to load up the new Fractal Candles SR v3 indi onto the charts.

Nice to have the source code, to dig around & see how things tick. But the trading comes first.

note to others: keep rereading post 1 updates

note to self: find out where to vote

cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Here's my understanding of what they are after watching price action a bit.

White candles are the bullish candles (provided that white is the setting you have in your chart properties) with the green portion being the part that broke resistance within so many candles back.

And the black candles are the bearish (again provided thats the color you have selected in properties) with the red being that part that broke support within the last # of candles.

Lou may be able to clear it better.

MM....so are we waiting for the candles to turn White and or Black depending on the timeframe that we are in....along with bounce/penetration of the ALF line?  Thanks in advance....

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi Lou, still use the alf v2 candles. The fractal sr candle come back to their original settings when you reload. I did check both of the candle indicators yesterday and as far as I can see they are the same color wise (or not?). The problem is that I tend to use a brighter color  for the sea green and that I don't use the bands. So, I would like to use the v2 for now. Besides that I know that alf in combination with alf candles has made tvi pointles, however I still love to use this little tvi that you introduced in the prior thread! I wouldn't be surpriced if there are more followers that use it. Hope to see you develloping your strategy in the coming time, but please don't mind that people already like what you have created in the past!

Thanks pbb

I'm NOT answering for Lou, but entering a trade A-g-a-i-n-s-t T-h-e T-r-e-n-d is usually NOT profitable, regardless of what any or all indicators may tell you!  That was a rather strong uptrend, was it not?

If you are still in the trade, I believe price may soon fall but it may take awhile.

Raymond

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Totally agree. Have you consider filtering with volume? I'm experimenting with only taking ALF trades when price crosses ALF with volume above average, in an attempt to catch strong moves only. This seems to be cutting out most of the crosses that lead to rangey situations where price moves back and forward over the ALF. So far so good.

Using Better Volume 1.4 indicator because it provides an average volume line enabling one to quickly see if volume is above or below average.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
But here the PA turn again ? trend up ?

Hi  rnfuller102

Thanks MM - I could not have explained it better.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Risky to trade against the prevailing trend. If you do it anyway, be prepared to take small gains and exit as soon as you see the slightest sign of trouble.

As for finding the trend if you are in doubt - try switching to H1 from M15 and see what it looks like there. Than you can go back to M5 or M15 with an understanding of the bigger picture.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Here is what I think is a good example of trading with the current trend, which I can easily on the time frames from 5 minutes to daily, which are ALL red. When the price action went back down over the the ALF line just awhile ago, I took a short. Naturally, i wouldn't be looking for a long trade on the UCAD now. Only shorts because that's its current trend for every single time period.

I am currently up 20 pips on this after only 5 minutes while typing. This is/was a a picture perfect setup as a good example of what to look for and with a good indicator at the top right that is unobtrusive. I'll put a stop on it now of one pip past my entry so I can't lose.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
i have nice results tooday with 1min scalps using this

and use some avagrees as filter

look nice i will test for couple days and mayby post it if it will be this good as tooday

check out last hours

about 70 pips

--- 帖子 #401 ---
A few here are having difficulty understanding retracements and how to trade them. This is an important chunk of knowledge you need to grasp.

Trends rarely move uninterrupted from inception to conclusion, There are usually points along the way when PA seems to have a "second thought" about the trend. PA stops and actually backs up a bit before continuing.

Examine the swing move (or trend) in the chart. The move begins at "High" and continues to "Low" with two points of hesitation marked A and B.

The move starts at 05:45 GMT and ends at 08:00 - the retracements occur at 07:00 and 07:30.

Using these times as a reference, shift your chart to M5 and see what's happening inside the M15 candles. I'll post that M5 chart later and continue this discussion.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Here's the same swing move on M5 with the same places marked.

Notice that the retracement highs (A and B) are descending from the point marked "High". Also notice the potential re-entry points when the candles turned red again. If you chose to take profits when PA reversed these would be the places to enter short again.

I hope this is some help.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Just went long when candle split at resistance, exit at bar close - +16 pips in a hurry.

Overall trend still up but getting a bit shaky (maybe).

--- 帖子 #404 ---
First, reread post 1. Reread until something clicks. (hint: it may be an aha moment)

I highly suggest reading Lou's first ALF/TVI thread.

If you've done your homework, you're waiting for the green and red colors.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Any candle open above or below ALF is a potential entry - you need to look at the overall trend to decide if it's a good entry or not:

If PA is chopping back and forth through a flat ALF, wait.

If PA is moving up or down through ALF (preferably from a bar or two prior to crossing) your odds of a good trade go up.

It really is all about pattern recognition and takes some screen time to see clearly. Have a look at Post #407...

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Standard ALF as I understand it.

A signal occured For a Short Entry @ 1.2041. This is against the recent strong uptrend and should be considered a counter-trend trade and should not be taken until you have a solid grasp of the system. The most recent previous high was at 1.2064 According to this method your stop should be a bit above that. When price went up to cross the Alf, you should have manually exited for a small loss of about -10 pips. Not Every signal will generate a profitable trade.

I hope this helps a bit.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Does everyone see the large up trend with two retracements along the way?

If not, speak up and I will mark them for you...

These retracements are so large they could be traded counter-trend (but let's leave that until later).

--- 帖子 #408 ---
the book. Waited for green candle crossing ALF to close. Entered @ 77.00, H1 and H4 were both in agreement. A no brainer, to use BRV's terminology, if I may.

Edit: trade exited for +40.9 pips after price stabilized and waffled around.

Caught the last nice move, I bailed at the last surge over 1.2100.

Lou G, after I enter a trade I tend to switch back and forth between ALF view and 1m w/Bollinger Bands. I've been doing this awhile but am definitely still learning. It seems by my observation, that the rallies seem to end with a last surge on the 1m chart. Does that sound accurate to you?

Don't forget, if the split candles don't float your boat, you can turn them off on the Inputs Tab.

I have both running, split on my live account and non-split on demo. I was originally undecided but I'm getting to like the split version.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
What a very effective system you have...I bagged some good pips today (Live) and wanted to thank you.

I have added a filter of my own that I think really helps pinpoint actual entries vs quick dips.  If you allow, I would like to post it...if not I understand.

Thanks

I'm glad you're making pips.

Plenty of members have posted their take on additional indicators - why not you? I will most likely not make it an official part of the ALF method (since I have spent many months developing ALF as it is) but, if you think it might help someone...

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi Lou,

The candle indicator I have is "Fractal candles SR 2. However it doesn't have the option of split candles in the Inputs Tab. Can you tell me the post number where I can find the indicator for these split candles.

Thank You.

Entry at the arrow (an open above ALF and in the direction of the prevailing trend).

Exit when PA and ALF re-connect.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Yes Sir, I will...I just know what it's like when people hi-jack a thread with every indicator under the sun...

Ok, it's a simple Stochastic Histogram that I have tooled up.

It overlays to Stochastic histo's when the Green one (faster) breaks zero line on or around the same time ALF is penetrated...thats a valid signal (could be a quick trip, could be along one)

When the Black one (slower) breaks zero line after the Green one (depending on how long it takes) you now have confirmation to hold the trade longer.

When the Black and Green go through zero simultaneously those are the BIG trades.

When the Green goes and the black doesn't move...get out because it was just a dip.

It's email alerted (I literally cannot trade without my cell phone text message alerts)  All credit for the indy goes to Oromek my polish buddy who does all my coding.
--------> NOTE!!: In this template the email notification is tabbed to FALSE...just change it to get email/txt message alerts

Take it or leave it...I just though I should try to give something back.

I personally use this system on 5M GU/GJ with another 15M chart open of GU/GJ to help see the bigger picture.

Also included is a basic template that employs the indicator as described above.

Hi Darren

Although I am usually a purist and try to keep my charts as indicator free as possible (which is why I like this ALF method so much).......I do recall you have provided some valuable input on other threads so I have downloaded your filter to try it out.

Many thanks!!

Hey PGPB, thank you for the kind words my friend.  I have to say that of all the strat's I've tested (and you know how many) this one is so simple and consistent...it's amazing.

Lou has done a great service to FF and Forex traders in general.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Sorry, for making multiple posts here.

I re-named the indy...please check the paperclip and get the newly named indy: Ultimate filter.mq4

If you want to add my indy to your current template just drag and drop 1, with the settings 20, 2, 2  then drop another (2) on top of it but change the settings to 40, 2,2 and change the only color visible (lawn green) to black.

Sorry about the confusion

Hi Pilotui,

Thanks for posting the indicator, I've been trading lou's approach (original TVI aswell) with CCI 34 confirmation which is very similar to your stoch indy - It's kept me out of many a sticky moment . e-mail alert is a bonus until Lou manages to find time to program the feature into fractal candles.

Thanks again

Doc.

Hi Lou, nice system you have!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hey Doc,

Would you post your TrendCCI? Thx.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Shortly before NY open, I pull up EU H1 to get a feel for market action. Today ALF on H1 was basically flat so no trend of any consequence therefore (for me) market may be ranging.

Switch to M15 - didn't like the look. It is ranging but ALF still pretty flat.

This is how I ended up at M5 which looks very tradable.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thanks for the many replies...I felt as though I cut some corners with my indy (the email alert message was wrong etc...)

So I decided to go ahead and do the work and make a formal & totally custom template with all my indy's that I use to trade.

Please note:  The currency strength lines are set to GU...if you want EU just open up the indy and select EUR as opposed to USD.  It is also email alerted...both realtime cross alert and a fully closed candle alert option.

The Trade Window indy simply paints start/stop trading times on your chart...they are set to my time zone (Oklahoma)

The others are tools that I use and have used for a while.

Buy vs Sell shows based on volume/bear/bull info how many buyers/sellers are in the market per candle

The Camarilla/fib/pivot indy works very well with GU...it obeys the lines...this one is very optional though.

I currently trade this system on both 5M and 15M Charts...I think you will find the addition of the strength lines gives us a good edge in the markets.  (It took me @ 3 months of tinkering to get the settings right for my other (personal) system...and you will see that when the strength changes and the Candle goes through the ALF...plus the Ultimate Filter confirmation...it's pretty solid.  See attached screenshot.

Note: by observing which currency is in control it should easily allow you to not take those trades that seem to screw everyone...because they are against the dominant currency...instead try going with the currency that is in control. For example, I will not take a Long trade when USD is above GBP.

Again, any questions please click my name and send me an EMAIL.

Thanks goes to Lou for his hard work and willingness to share...he's inspired me to let go of some of my prized jewels in my trading arsenal.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I did download the newer version and still didn't get the split candles; but as soon as I deleted the old version (fractral candles v2) the split candles showed up.

If I had to do it again I would close that chart, open a new one and start downloading the new template and indicators from the beginning. Otherwise, make sure you delete the older version.

Bcarbon

--- 帖子 #447 ---
The key here is to shut down MT4 and restart - I have many versions of the indicators on my system and they all play nice in the sandbox

Nothing needs to be deleted, IMHO. MT4 WILL NOT pick up on new stuff unless it is shut down/restarted...

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I just now detected a small bug in the split candles (not to worry - does not interfere with trading in any way).

I'll fix it over the weekend, along with adding the long-awaited alerts.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
And yet one more:

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I take it back - no bug there at all - Fractal_Candles_SR_v3 is doing just what it should.

I will have the version with alerts (including email) ready on Monday.

Lou,

I won't take credit for any hard work.  I have a programme that just does it for me automatically.  In this case I have html of all the posters to this thread, how many they posted and what page they started posting on.  I just find it easier sometimes to come up to speed by only reading the originator's posts at first.  Then I will selectively pick a few others to read that appear to have come up with great ideas or mods.

Then when I am up to speed I can do the normal daily reading.

Just figured that someone else could also benefit.  i did the same for your original ALF thread as well as i had to read that to make sure I understood the genesis of this thread.

Great thread.  A few demo successes and 1 failure over past few days on M15.

Hi KP,

If I take Trades on m5/m15 I just use the candles as per the rules on page 1. (I posted a screen dump of m5 for pilotui to compare with his indi as it is very similar).

I use the CCI on m1 which is where most of my trades are placed. CCI setting of 34 and trading the alf crosses or re-entries in the direction she's showing. ignore the 67 level as this is not used, it just happens to be a default of the indi and havn't turned it off. first couple of trades of a any CCI trend usually give me the best results and then only taking little bites of the cherry if the swing has been in place for a while.

Hope this clarifies

regards

Hi Alex

You are describing a common occurence. I have no idea why that happens, but I have had the same trouble before also.

There is NOT a problem with the template, it is just a weird thing that happens.

The solution is as follows.

Save the file, to your desktop,  and change where it says save as .php to save as "all files"...when you are saving it....rename it to the name you want, saving it to your desktop....and then drop it into your template files.

I hope my explanation makes sense.

Anybody suffering C.A.W.S (Compulsary Alf Withdrawal syndrome) at the weekend? .Well here's something that the doctors ordered!!.A nice easy trade simulator that can be used through the MT4 strategy tester.place the correct files in their associated folders and hey presto! trade all week end.You can choose your day, your timeframe, currency,speed it up, slow it down, trade 10 x full lots, infact whatever you want, have fun.

THe only problem with it is that when you place atrade at the weekend the closing spread from your broker is likely to be big, but through normal trading hours it will reflect whatever your broker offers.

Hi guys,

what settings are used on the core ALF indicator?

When I use the deafult ones as downloaded from Page One of this thread indicator plots completely diffrently from the charts you post.

I get indicator plotted on price mostly.I hardly get any crossovers..so there must be something wrong with the settings.

I understood that TVI is no longer used as it has been "built in" into the bars...

While I have no problem with the use of supplementary indicators other than Fractal_Candles_SR_v3, I would prefer that their use does not take over the thread.

In Post #1 I mentioned that one of the goals of the ALF method is to eliminate the use of indicators based on moving averages. This is not to say that I am against moving averages - only that the requirement to provide the number of periods used for the moving average is restrictive. We've all been there and back with this - try an ema5; no, that's too jumpy; try an ema20; no, that's too late, etc. In addition, moving between time frames almost always requires a lot of tinkering to get the periods right - and even then they are only right for the small chunk of the chart you're optimizing. Even the TVI used in the original thread was a compromise that I was not happy with and that indicator has been replaced in this thread by one that requires no tinkering at all.

If anyone feels moved to start their own thread using ALF in combination with whatever indicator pleases you, I have no objection (just give it a different name). ALF has been generously provided to the public domain by its author in his books and on his website - my only contribution is the translation from EasyLanguage to MQL4 and the source code is posted in the original ALF thread.

I appreciate all contributions to the thread and accept them all as an attempt to help, but I definitely will not allow the thread to become a collection of everyone's favorite indicators.

I sincerely hope that this post is taken in the spirit it is meant.

Hi Lou,

I think you have done a great job with ALF and your approach and have been a follower from the start. I really like the way you tutor and guide the community and I fully understand that this thread should be far from adding whatever indicators, if only it was just out of respect to you. I myself use a little indy and that's just for my optical confirmation. Probably it will be possible without it, but I like it and so I use it. That's the little beast inside the traders mind and I am doing fine with it. The ALF candles are great, but myself I would not disregard the tvi, that's a need indicator. Maybe you've been able to replace that totally by the candles for your own trading, I still use it and am very happy you introduced it in the prior thread. I use the signal lines with adjusted settings (they have been used in the thread for just a short time) and they give what I need besides the candles and ALF. Maybe it's to much, but as an optical focussed trader I like the lines very much.

Hope that you will continue with this great work and for all followers, please keep this thread as it is. Maybe a little sideway is not to bad, but if your approach differs to much please consider to start your own thread.

(a ps to Darren, I really liked the stochastic based ultimate filter!)

Thanks pbb

I continue to search for a better indicator to work well with ALF.

In the last few days I reviewed most of John Ehlers published indicators and, after a lot of experimentation, ended up with an indicator called Instant Trendline and coded IT_Candles (posted below) to interface with it.

This is as beta as it gets since I did most of the work when the market was closed and so have no idea how it will work on live data.

If any of you would like to be beta testers, download both indicators, put them in yourmt4/experts/indicators and replace Fractal_Candles_SR_v3 with IT_Candles on your chart.

Tentative entry/exit rules:

Long on green, short on red, exit on all color changes.

Post feedback, please.

Thanks,

Lou G

AY AY Captain.

On it !!

Thank you Lou, as always for your hard work,

just more painful that i need to wait after the weekend to test these new indis.

also how is the alert coming on the Alf candle system? i really like to see if my trade entry points are the same as yours. see how close i can come to what you have.

have a nice weekend and i already templated the indis together so i can check it on pairs nobody test, expect me

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi Lou,

I added them to the chart and they look real nice, less jumpy and sticking with the trend. Don't know how they will react in live trading. Some things look very nice in a static environment but tend to do things different in live mode. Such as repainting or huge cpu absorbtion. I will look at it closely monday morning and will leave a reply on the board before your monday morning wake up call! One question, the alpha value in the settings, how do you come up with the number? Is it mathematical founded, based on Ehlers work or just plain simple trial and error?

Thanks pbb

Just saw the instant trendline indicator has the same alpha value. So if that's a standard indicator, my question is answered.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Ehlers suggests 0.07 but I found that 0.09 works better for my purposes,

--- 帖子 #482 ---
The alert will be done by Monday.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Lou, when you say "exit on all color changes", do you mean when the IT lines cross or when the candles change from red or green to one of the other colors?

--- 帖子 #484 ---
No need to have the Instant Trend indicator on the chart (in fact, better not to). The candles change color when the lines cross and when PA is not moving in the same direction as the trend. So, "yes" to the second part of your question...

Should look like this:

--- 帖子 #485 ---
See Post #1. Download ALF_Alert.ex4 and copy to yourmt4/experts/indicators. Alerts will be sent (once, and only once) when PA is about to open above/below ALF.

To anticipate a question, I was unable to find a reliable way to determine coding-wise when "ALF is flat and PA is cycling back and forth". I would have excluded this situation if I could have but better too many alerts than not enough

Here's a screenshot of ALF_Alert with the optional arrows enabled:

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hi Lou,

So from now on you are suggesting to use the IT_candles in place of Fractal_SR_candles or we just wait for the results and see how the new one performs in live market?

Thanks for all your efforts.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
No, not at all. I plan to be using it on Monday to see how it performs live but others may either continue using what they are used to or become beta testers of the new IT_Candles - your choice.

EDIT - John Ehlers has a Power Point presentation  on the Instant Trendline posted at his website - if interested, look under the "Seminars" tab.

Thanks, I will check it out.

Lou,

You state enter/exit on colour change and never refer to the ALF line in your discussion on IT Candles.  However, your chart shows IT candles with the ALF line.

On putting IT candles on my charts, green is always above while red is always below (as expected i guess but they do sometimes straddle the line).  So am i assuming that it is self-evident and therefore no discussion about IT candles and ALF is warranted or are you implying that the ALF is not even required.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Sorry I was not clear about that - ALF definitely remains on the chart.

I did say that IT_Candles (if it works properly) may supplant Fractal_Candles but I'm sure I did not suggest that it was eliminating ALF.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
just subscribing...seems like a very good simple system.

to be clear, the MQ4 file goes into which folder?

thanks

jacob

--- 帖子 #493 ---
IMHO, your setup is way too complicated - the official ALF method looks like the screenshot in post #489. But, if it floats your boat...

--- 帖子 #494 ---
@ Lou ,

i´m so sorry .

Yes it´s correct.

I don´t see the newer Posts from you ...

Lou, GREAT system! I am a long time lurker first time poster to your thread.

I am sure you have already thought of this, but, when I change the ALF line color to say, green, and 1 point thickness, when I reload the chart it always reverts back to the blue, 2 line thickness. I am waiting until Tuesday to load up the newest indicators after your live trading on Monday so that issue may have already been addressed.

Thanks and keep up the great work.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Don't change the color or thickness.

LOL

(sorry could not resist)

--- 帖子 #497 ---
There is a whole procedure to change colors and indis so they stay the way you wish, but that goes outside the purpose of this thread.

Consider it to fall under the subject programming.

I found these indicators in my arsenal.  The only thing I know about them is that they came from a FF thread somewhere. I  plugged them in my charts and now I get arrows in the direction of the crossing.  I also get a little sound alarm when that happens.

B,

Those are great indies.  I've used them before in other systems.

The thing is there are NO moving averages used in the ALF system.

They are very useful but I don't see how they could fit in here.

Change the color on the inputs tab (instead of the color tab) - it'll work fine.

Check out the ALF_Alert (see Post#1). It has optional arrows, makes noises and sends emails...

Do you have ALF_Alert on your chart? Those appear to be the arrows put there by that indicator...

EDIT: Nope they aren't from ALF_Alert. Congratulations - you've just added a crossover signal for two ema's that are not on the chart

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Or save the setup as a template once you have it the way you want it...

--- 帖子 #509 ---
I honestly don't know what's best - members are using ALF on many pairs (including the Loonie).

I've been monitoring the behavior of IT_Candles and ALF_Alert since the market opened - all looks OK.

Alf alert on my chart and not giving arrows or alerts. Hmmm. I think its time for a new computer

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Currency pair? Time frame?

Give me something to work with...

If you have arrows enabled, you should have historical arrows showing.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Thanks, LouG!  Very very nice work here.  Totally newbie, so I appreciate the simplicity very much.   To all other contributors, well deserved kudos too.

I have a question though, I made the setup as how it was described in post#1, somehow I am not getting the same color and arrow as your post, LouG?  Is there a need for any special settings?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
The signal bars indicator you posted (post #403) seems very interesting.  Do I just attach it to the charts?  No need to change any settings?

There seems to be many colors aside from GREEN/RED.  What does other color mean?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Post #332, I dont see the ALF_candles_v2 in post #1, does it mean we dont use this anymore?

I think the Fractal_Candles_v3 supercedes this one, as there's an option to "split candle" or not?  Am I correct?

Nice job, Lou G!

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi Lou,

Many thanks for this great thread!

Regarding the alert arrows...I consider them distracting. I suppose if traders use them as ALERTS and not trade ENTRIES, they can be considered useful. However, on the right side of the most recent posted chart, Laguere is flat and bisecting the price range, yet we have 3 arrows, which if followed, would have ended in whipsawed trades. There is definitely a lack of price action pulling away from Laguere. Maybe there could be a setting whereby we can adjust the threshold after price opens on either side of the line? Maybe something like 5 or 10 pips before an arrow is activated?

Just my 2 cents worth...

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Sorry if I confused the issue - I'm beta testing a new version of the candles and inadvertently posted a screenshot from my demo.

You're okay with the setup from Post #1

--- 帖子 #519 ---
You are correct

--- 帖子 #520 ---
You may turn the arrows off - they are an option on the Inputs Tab.

The purpose of the alerts is to let you know that PA has opened above/below ALF - this may or may not be a good time to trade. That's a decision you'll need to make on your own.

Trying to set a threshold is a very slippery slope from a coding standpoint - almost any value will be wrong some of the time. Unfortunately, the rules of the method are not all mechanical and possible to program - some things can only be done by the computer between our ears...

--- 帖子 #521 ---
HI Lou,

have loaded and re-loaded this indicator many times now and I dont get more than this! Can you help?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Thanks for your reply, Lou.

BTW, what was old Benjamin right about?

Inquiring minds want to know...

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Do you also have Instant_Trend.ex4 installed?

Reference is to Old Benjamin (the donkey) in George Orwell's "Animal Farm"...

As it turned out, he was right about everything.

Hello LouG, I'm having like problem, I add screen so you see

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Long at the up arrow.  I did not take the previous down signal as it was counter-trend.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
You don't need to have Instant Trend on the chart.

Looks like you have your up/down candle colors reversed (on the basic chart). Should be white candles up, black candles down. Probably the basic chart is set to green/black instead of black/white. Hit F8 and check it...

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Took +10 pips on the trade in post #530 - could have been more if I had been paying closer attention...

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi Lou, yes Instant trendline is on, removed everything else to make sure there was no interference. Still not working?

Have never had any problems with any of your indies!!

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Thx to you LouG

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Got +6 on this one.  Rule is exit right when color changes or when color is changed on closed bar?  Or best judgement?

Lou, i did not install Instant_trend either. I just installed all the files from post 1. Do I need instant trend? if so, I did not see it on any post...but maybe I missed it?

It's working fine - look back to Friday. There have been no bear candles since then on GY.

Hope you've been long since then - you can buy us all dinner

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Only if you are beta testing IT_candles.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Here you go, even the down move had no bear candles...sorry should of posted this view earlier!..

LOL..did not ride the whole move but taken bits and pieces out!!..

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Are you beta testing IT_Candles?

Answer is both - see how PA is moving. If enthusiastically, you can stay with the trade.

In the case of the post #530 trade, note the high of the 12:15 bar is much higher, then a retreat to close (where I got out). What this says to me is that some traders want it higher, others are not convinced, so I took the exit. If the long traders prevail, I can enter again.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
PLEASE - either identify yourself as beta tester or post a chart along with your question so I know which candle version you're using...

Thank you

--- 帖子 #538 ---
In fact, anyone with a question should post a chart if the question is chart-related.

Posts like " I have a problem, candles are not right...." and do not include currency pair and time frame are very hard to respond to.

In addition to this, I'm also trading...

I dont know if u r referring to me, but i am nothing of a beta tester...dont even know how to if I tried...i just read one of the posts that mentioned the IT trend and inquired about it.

H LouG,

First of all I'll confess to being a luker, and enjoying testing out your indi's. Thanks to you and the coders for all your input.

I am currently beta testing the IT_Candles, however I am having the same problem as others regarding the candle colouring. I cannot seem to get any all-red bear candles to show up see attachment. Luckily GU and EU it is all up today so only green candles required :-)

Hope you can help

@Nick'em, can you share your indicator on the huge price and the candle time?  Thanks!

Beta tester.  Sorry.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Open the pair you want to see - chart will default to H1, green on black.

Set color scheme to black/white.

Set background to something neutral but not glaring.

Set Grid color to something contrasting so you can see the bid line.

Add indicators.

Save as template so you don't have to do this all over again next time...

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Probably Instant_Trend - you don't need it on the chart (unless you like it).

It simply has to exist on your system so IT_Candles can find it.

Fractal_Candles_SR_v3 (if you're using the original setup) doesn't need it at all.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Lou G,

Hi, I noticed after I took off the dotted lines, it keeps on coming back every time I changed timeframe.  Is there a way to turn it off?

I get confused with those lines... hehehe ... what is its significance, pls?

@Lou G, I am a certified LouG/ALF fanatic now!!!

Made my first ever ALF trade, and won with 6 pips ... hahahahah!

Enter a bit late, just went online now, and close at the first sign of retracement.  After reading ALF thread 1 (old) and this new thread, I need to put in more screen time now.

Of course, I hope to understand more, so I will comprehend the charts more as I stare and backtest them.

Kudos!!!

@Nick'em, thanks!   That was quick!

More pips to all of us!!!

... which is typical Monday, absent news.

Time to get your setups correct, so if PA actually goes anywhere we can concentrate on trading

I have original setup on demo, beta setup on live account, running simultaneously - just a suggestion.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
and at the risk of appearing dummer and dummer, I have applied beta-test template to H1 Gbp/Jpy chart and red candles are not being produced, looking back to April. Lou, it looks as though the down candle color setting is not holding in the IT_Candles indy.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
The day so far:

Long at point A, good for +80 or so.

Counter-trend at point B. If you took it, good for +20.

Long at point C, good for +20 or so.

This is on beta setup, same results on original setup.

Point A was during London session, so I was not awake yet, but I know many of you were, so it's included as an example - Brits get all the good trades

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Don't know the reason for all the problems - I was very busy today trying to trade plus field all the posts - perhaps I screwed something up (or you guys did).

No matter, here is the beta setup (assuming you already have ALF.ex4).

Here is a link to a FREE little download that you can use to change the spread in MT4 when using the mt4 tester on the weekend.

click on the "Spread Controller" and then if you click on the "contact us" in the yellow bar and simply ask for info on the spread controller they will send you the link to download it.   It is free no strings attached, (they have never sent me anything other than the link)

Took me all of 2 minutes to set up with the supplied pdf. instructions...

I do not know if it will work with your simulator but it does let you set the  spread to your choosing and will run in the mt4 tester with that spread until you remove the script.  So it could very well work with your simulator..

Lou, the ALF Alert arrows won't show on my chart. I have them on several pairs and the 15 minute time frame, and show arrows and send alert set to true.

I have other alerts that I can use, so no big problem. Just letting you know. Thanks for your work on this system. I have combined some other indicators I had along with some that Pilotui had and is working fine for me. I find the best way to trade it is not to jump in early, but to make sure the price action is there and not a temporary thing. I also stay with the trend most of the time, and just go for 10 pips or so. As most probably know, if you can consistently make a net of just 20-30 pips a day, you can do very well in forex.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Sorry about that last post.  The image server I was using kept double posting the picture.

Hi Lou,

No problems at all. The candles are great, alf alerts seems to work fine as well, don't use them (arrows) however.

Benjamin must be a proud donkey!

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Here's where I sign off  from trading for the day (although I will be around for questions until everyone has resolved their chart setup problems).

Decent trading on EU M15 and on other currencies as I see from the posts.

Resolution has been provided for those who were having problems with IT_Candles and ALF_Alert:

Solution: download ALF.ex4 from Post #1 and install - presto, everything works.

There will be NO discussion of chart problems tomorrow - trading only.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
ALF Beta setup works like a charm.

Alerts work properly too.

Although I prefer Fractal candles as my favorite indi. Just from ALF perspective, I think IT Candles are more superior, as it highlights the ALF as the star of the chart.

Just to eloborate ALF works on any pair, any time frame, I am posting GBPJPY on a 30 minute chart.

I am attaching my simple chart template as reference.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Missed the fine print, as usual. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
HI Lou,

sorry for the distractions today, I totally agree "just trading tomorrow"!

Thanks once again for a great system and your ongoing support.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Arrow problem solved. I didn't have the ALF.exe in my indicators. Now that I loaded it, arrows appear. Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Not a single problem using the beta version.

Not really into using the arrows, but maybe need to get used to them now.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
.. so we can get down to business tomorrow.

If you have not done so, do the following:

Download and install ALL (repeat, ALL) indicators from Post #1. These will provide the ALF method. If you don't want to use the template, that's fine but get ALL the indicators.

If you want to beta test IT_Candles, download and install:

IT_Candles.ex4 and Instant_Trendline.ex4 from the paperclip icon.

Set up your chart(s) in any way you wish as far as colors, etc. but they should bear a close resemblance to charts I have posted.

Please post charts using the MT4 "Save as picture" facility (on the file menu) rather than some other method. That way they can be enlarged in FF by those who want to look at them.

If you still need to resolve chart issues, try to post your questions TODAY so we can spend time on trading tomorrow (and on subsequent days). The ALF method is about simplifying the charts with the goal in mind of focusing on TRADING (rather than on often-redundant indicators).

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I'm a little confused, are the arrows buy/sell signal indicators?

Towards the end of the chart, how should one interpret?

Hi all,

Please can someone tell me if this is a good entry? I took the short at the open of the last bar at 1.2250 because red (and black) candle (big) closed below ALF.

At first the trade went against me and then I took 10 pips profit.

I am not sure because of the large candle that crossed the ALF. If it is very large, should I enter before the open of the next one?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Is there an option on the alert for candle close instead of candle open?  Can this be added as an option?  thanks

If you made +10 pips it's a good trade. It is, however, counter-trend (against the prevailing trend, which has been up for about 12 hours). If you are new to Forex, you might want to trade only with the trend until you learn about retracements and other price patterns.

When you gain some experience with ALF, you might not want to wait for the arrow (or, you might not want to use the arrow at all).

At this point, good job...

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Actually, ALF_Alert is already looking at the previous close rather than the current open.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hello @ all,

the new IT Candels are very impressive. Thanks to LOU G!!!

To determine the Trend the SMA 48 looks good to me...

Or, you can compare where ALF is now to where it was at the left side of the chart...

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi Lou,

you mean this ?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
That was an EPIC response.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Ok Thanks ...

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Question for Lou here, or am I being just dumb? On beta testing of IT candles, what do we do on candles that are black or white? The reason I ask is because on post 558 you say at B trade would have been good for about 20pips, however on my chart all these candles were black including your entry candle, and I thought we only went long on green, short on red. Could you explain entry conditions using IT candles one more time for a simpleton like myself just so that I am clear.

Many Thanks

Geoff

I'm trying to install the ALF indicator set.  I got the fractal candles, but I dont have the center line that price is supposed to pass through.  Instead I have a line above the candles AND a line below.

I downloaded and installed everything as directed on the first page and checkd it a couple of times.  Anyone know whats wrong?

--- 帖子 #618 ---
can you show a screen shot?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
You need to save the ALF.ex4 file in experts/indicators folder and drag it on to the chart.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
That trade signal shows red on the Fractal_Candles and is also an open below ALF which meshes with the basic entry guidelines - BUT it's counter-trend (which I didn't like).

Some would take it anyway which is why I mentioned it.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
I wish I could say it's original but I saw it on Jacko's journal and in a  Bill Williams book before that...

I hope you don't feel I'm being rude or having fun at your expense - if so, I apologize.

I've earned a reputation out here at FF for being anti-indicator and I enjoy removing unnecessary indicators from charts even more than some enjoy putting them there in the first place.

My Significant Other is the best trader I know (she trades equities) who barely knows what a chart is, much less an indicator, but she is very successful. She shrugs off her occasional losses (some so large that they would make my hair catch fire if I incurred them) as if they did not exist and almost never worries about her account balance.

I'm really not anti-indicator - just anti-more-than-one-indicator-telling-me-the-exact-same-thing.

Anyway, I hope I have not offended you. Many out here will tell you that I will go to great lengths to help others (and they're right), but I sometimes rub people the wrong way.

Any problems, let me know...

Lou G

--- 帖子 #623 ---
... for your feedback on IT_Candles.

Keep in mind that this indicator is an experiment only at this point. I plan on watching it (putting in my screen time) for at least a week or two and, if results are not what I want, it will not replace Fractal_Candles.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Hi Guys, Lou G - thx for sharing attitude and nice work. I would do the same if had any brains

Does anyone else see the tendency that arrows are in pairs – more often than not. First arrow against the trend is usually wrong – the second one with the trend is right and nice move follows?

Btw. Sorry for noob question. What program do you use for browsing forum posts? I got tired of F5-refreshing. RSS is also no good for me since not entire post is shown?

thx in advance

--- 帖子 #625 ---
... late in the day. The same ones will also show up using Fractal_Candles.

Based on a glance at ALF (about the same now as at the left of the screen), EU may be ranging more than trending.

EDIT: Oops, sorry - we already did that up trade earlier. ONE more good trade...

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Ok, I think I know the problem, when I try to download the file for some reason it downloads as a .php file.  Tried downloading it from the first page of this thread and the thumbnail.

Could someone please message me with the correct file in the right extention format?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hello KumoDragon, download from papperclip at top of this page. Hide images to find only mt4 files.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
no problem to save as php.  but, after you save it, rename it to what it really is, including the file extension (.ex4 etc.)

then, download the next one from post 1, and so on.

(it took me a few runs around the block to figure that out myself)

-jacob

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Did that I'll try it again.  I see the file after I download, I put it in the proper folder and it still doesn't show up in my custom indicators or indicators

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hello jacob, if download from papperclip no problems like that

--- 帖子 #631 ---
sorry then KumoDragon, problems I been having with .php were ok when I downloaded from papperclip

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Thanks, finally got it.   Must have been a file type thing, had a file with exact name and extension in the folder, but when I pasted it this time instead of overrighting it, it made another one right next to it.  Strange.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
thanks...I wish you were there earlier for me when I was running around the block.

I worry about going back to paper clip because sometimes one must find several paper clips to get all the needed files. This is why I always go back to the original post. Most thread starters always update the files in post 1.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

thanks a bunch

Hi Lou

I've been following both your threads for the past few weeks. I had good success with the other system BUT now you've done it. The only way you could make this easier is if you logged onto my account and did the trading. No it's not perfect but I feel pretty confident when I place a trade that I'm going to make pips.

I'm on the east coast in NY and I usually get here to trade about 7:30 A.M. for the NY open. Most of the time - like today - I have my day made by 8:30 A.M. After that I play with the different indicators looking to make something clear more clear.

I like your idea of simplicity - my brother-in-law trades with so many indicators that by the time he makes a decision to trade it's too late and opportunity has past. This is by far the simplest and most effective system I've ever see.

Thank you so much - you have a great deal of patience and you deserve a great deal of blessings.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Lou...are you giving yourself an entry point a few pips away from close or from high/low of previous bar or are you entering market trades?

Also, are you trading more than just EU 15 minutes t/f?

thanks again...system is great.

jacob

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I trade almost the same hours - I try to get the chart up by 06:45 my time which is 15 minutes before NY open.

Some days I'm done early as well.

Thanks for posting - I'm glad it's working for you.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I use buy/sell scripts set up on MT4 hot keys and trade at market - only EU for now, mostly M15 but occasionally M5 or H1 depending on what appears to be trending/ranging in a good way and is not too choppy. I try for 1 to 3 trades per day and absolutely quit for the day when London closes.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Lou G,

Although I am not sure what the new red/green lines are supposed to do in the charts, I'd like to report that think I got the TESTER's setup is ok.   At least, it looks a lot like all the rest here.

Keeping an eagle eye on this thread for more updates!

--- 帖子 #641 ---
The lines are created by the Instant_Trend indicator and don't need to be on the charts (so you can remove the indicator from your setup).

Instant_Trend DOES need to be in your experts/indicators folder though - it is essential for the correct functioning of IT_Candles.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Thank you for the clarification.

Very much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Are there any plans or interest of having a trade room for this system?

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Nope - we're using this forum from 12:00 - 16:00 GMT on all trading days as our trade room.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Going to trade rooms are where threads fall apart, not all thread participants switch to use them.

Keep the trade info going here then people can see the charts and catch up & compare to their own charts and then add their ideas / comments / support.

Like checking the 2nd arrows ...

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Gonna take this for a spin. Believe I have all the proper files that were updated today. Loaded the last alf_it template. Does this look correct?

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hi

Is there a way by which i can enter the same order in two pairs with 1 click. EURUS and EURJPY trade exacltly the same. I want to target less pips but in two pairs.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Have you thought this concept through...you would be paying 2x's the commission and have to worry about news from 2 different countries/regions.

Just play GU instead of EU if it's not enough pips...if EU moves 10 pips, GU moves 20 and GJ move 30-40 (higher spread)

Just a thought...and also hedging doesn't work for intra day trading...

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I'm not a newbie, but I imagine some here would beg to differ based on some of my previous posts. Sometimes it takes something simple to turn on the light bulb. Of course, most have heard that all you need do is look at the left side of the chart to determine the trend, but it took me to now to realize the simplicity of this.

If you have a 15 minute chart, depending on what size chart you use, that chart has roughly 16 hours of time on it. Make it smaller, and you have even more hours. Looking all the way to the left and glancing at the right, one can see if the pair is going up, or down....DUH! That gives you almost a whole day of trades to see what the buyers and sellers have been doing.

Going up from right to left, a buy is better. Flat from right to left, look for another pair. Going down from right to left, look to sell.

Now, why didn't I think of that before??

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Yes, there is.  You can use a script..I believe that there is one in the programming tech forum that allows you to trade multiple pairs with one execution.

However,  you are doubling your risk so why not make it simple and enter twice the lotsize on EU if you want to double your risk and decrease the take profit pips you need.

if you think that doubling your risk on EU is bad then doubling your risk by going with highly correlated pairs is no different just more confusing.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Well said...thats pretty much what I meant.  Why double your commission?

Hi All,

thought I should post these after the lack of trading talk yesterday!..lol

Hi Dirty,

Nice to see someone trading on GBP/JPY

Could you please explain where did you close the loosing trades?

- when the bar opened in the other side of the ALF?

- a few pips away from the ALF?

I am having a difficult time to close the loosing ones.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
I like to trade GY too, but a bit too volatile, I believe.

Anyway, just logged in and "missed" the BUY.

It is a valid entry I think (orange arrow).

QUESTION:

During the entry, the ALF line is downward bias, right?  So is the entry valid?  Or do we have to wait for a few more candles?

I was thinking the 3rd candle after the orange arrow?

--- 帖子 #659 ---
My apologies if I have missed the answer to this:

What is the level of repaint on ALF_alert? I just saw it repaint not the current bar, but the penultimate bar. Is that as far back as the repaint goes?

Yes, wait for the color change.

--- 帖子 #661 ---

I'll take a stab at it and say no repaint.  It's pretty much either on or off based upon the open of the candle on the other side of the alf.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Yes, based on previous close above/below ALF so it's running off a closed bar rather than current bar.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
yes....looks like you have the indicators installed correctly......but why not just download the indicators ***AND THE TEMPLATE*** from the first post, that way you are guaranteed to get it right.

Then if you want to make changes (like using bars, rather than candles etc) you can change them from the template.

By the way, I see you are a James 16 member....good for you.....great teaching that is.

PGPB

--- 帖子 #680 ---
I used to only trade GJ for the last 2 years...using a Trailing Stop on the beast is begging for an early stop out.

GJ is so volatile that you are better off setting an initial target (for GJ I used 15 pips)

So when I hit +15 I'd move my SL to Break Even...

Even better is trading with 2 lots...close the first lot at +15 and then move SL to BE on the remaining lot...then you can ONLY WIN...there is no losing.

Hi pilotui,

Your post here with the indi seems interesting.  I think LouG suggested (to some posters) to open a new topic/thread if with some interesting indi's

Hope I am not off topic.

Re ALF, maybe because I dont have enough screen time yet, that's why either I am waiting too long before entering a trade, or chickening out when in the trade?

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Looks fine

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Yesterdays nigh equaled (look at H1 chart) - big round numbers are always interesting places

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Using TP might helps. I use 10-15 for EU and 15-30 for EJ. BE and Trail stops from 75% target for EJ. But it really depends on the trade itself. When looking for short retrace I might use smaller TP, when going with trends I'll go with bigger TP.

Closing trade is a bit harder to do in live. Especially when the PA shooting back at us in fast movement and requotes making it worst.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
My comments so far today have been market related.

Here's an ALF-related thought - I notice that when ALF begins to move toward PA (as it's doing now on EU M15), PA often moves to reconnect with ALF.

Meaning, let's see if PA moves down to meet ALF...

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Ops, don't get me wrong.  Very interested in your indicators, so I was thinking if we can expound on it further.

If not possible, let's drop the topic.  My apologies for going off topic.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Gotcha...Right now I'm just focusing on trading...running a thread is a lot of work.

Sorry for jumping on ya!

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I'd love to hear thoughts from the more experienced traders about how they treat the high effect news announcements.  According to the explanation on the news page, the TIC data this morning should have been positive for the USD.  That thought prompted me to be cautious and not jump in long on the E/U at the time that data was announced.

I believe there are forces at work that we do not know about behind the scenes that are artificially propping up currencies.  Those of you who have been successfully doing this for several years, what are your thoughts?  Did you jump in long when PA finally broke through the 1.2276 resistance?

--- 帖子 #689 ---
USDJPY

#A - got in

#B - chickened out when PA is "crossing" ALF

Lost 5 pips (including 3 pip spread)

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I don´t know if there is a laggin par. for me the point is if some thing is goin on USDJPY, off course it will affect the others corretated and vice versa.

I have a future plan to bring these correlations to a mathematic guy to study probabilities.

sorry the bad english.

On another subject, I have no interest in participating in a trading room of any kind. I'm not much of a joiner anyway and, between keeping up with what's going on here and doing my own trading, I can't think about being busier than I already am.

The upside of this sluggish EU has allowed me to just "put in my screen time" on IT_Candles.

All looks good and the indicator/setup I'm using seem to telling me all that I need to know about the market - feel very comfortable with it thus far.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Well, had that one trade on GJ.

ANALYSIS:

Ok with entry but moves can be fast so best to use a hotkey script to enter faster.

ALF system gave me 26 pips.  maximum of 32 pips if I could enter faster.

Trade management was poor.  Used a TS of 20 to get me out.  Overall bad idea.  Ended up with +6 pips.  Some good suggestions from others here on best way to handle it.  THANKS..

ALF:

Good timing.  Provided a winner.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Lou,

How do YOU determine a change in trend?  Do you ignore it unless there is hours of movement in a particular direction (or a quick huge move in the opposite direction)?

--- 帖子 #696 ---

Yes, noticed that too.

Problem is, how can we know if the PA is the one going to connect to ALF, or the ALF going to connect with the PA?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
I don't KNOW - I occasionally take a chance (like when I get out of bed in the morning)

M5 is starting to look like the place to be today - probably should have been there earlier.

Keep in mind that, even though I've been live-trading ALF since March (and went back to August, 2009 during development), I'm still learning to use my new tools just as you are...

--- 帖子 #700 ---
WTF! - M5 just began to chop. Perhaps my adventure trade was a retracement. Only problem is upside resistance is around 1.2300.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
I am so in-decisive today!  Argh!  After missing 4 awesome 5 min trades during LON...now this chop has me guessing.

I do notice PA-ALF connection...I was tempted to buy the bottom of that hammer on the 5M and ride it up to the ALF...would have been good for 15 (NOW 30+) DAMN! or so on GU.

I hate not pulling the trigger

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Mark Douglas ("Trading In The Zone") says leaving pips on the table is traders greatest fear (next to an outright loss). How true...

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Whats worse is I saw it before it happened, was conscious of it...held my finger on the trigger and said "do it...it's a 5 pip SL"  Yet DIDN'T do it.

Now 45 pips later...

You missed my post on this subject - see the previous...

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Once again today, I've proved that I am a much better programmer than a trader. Those who followed the ALF guidelines gained a minimum +37 pips (see the chart) on two long trades.

I, on the other hand, gained +20 on two trades, one of them counter-trend.

Still, +20 is right around the goal I begin each day with, so I'm modestly pleased.

Sorry about the trading room thing - I just feel my trading would suffer (even more) by adding any more distractions.

Lou,

Thx for all the great work you've done.

Two questions. What do the cndl colors mean when they are part white/blk  and red/green? I tried but couldn't find an explaination of the colors.

Also my cndl colors do not match yours. I triple checked to be sure I  downloaded correctly. Is it in the settings?

See my chart which is same TF as your last one.

I've read thru most of this thread and still cannot find the answers.  Sorry if I missed it. Please direct me to the post that gives answers.

I did read the first post but my confusion is that your cndls don't match mine.

Thanks for your help, Barry

I'm using IT_Candles - you are using Fractal_Candles. That's why the charts differ.

The split candles change color when previous S/R is penetrated. I think of them as eye-candy but some members really like them...

--- 帖子 #717 ---
It isn't a separate indicator - it's built into Fractal_Candles_SR_v3 (currently the standard candle indicator for ALF).

--- 帖子 #718 ---
I like IT_Candles a lot (but I may be prejudiced).

Anyone else?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Loosing trade closed after next candle opened above entry, spread was widening so closed out for small loss. My normal spread on GY is around 3 pips which makes it possible to make good trades, but spread does tend to fluctuate in these low volume times and thus spread widens, so you have to be careful! I would rather make a small loss or a small profit than see a bigger hit!!

Sometimes it works sometimes it does not. On the whole I remain profitable with this system thus far which is all thanks to Lou.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Hi,

I like it too, i only have to learn how to be more disciplined and constant and wait for the right setup. I'm still learning...

--- 帖子 #722 ---
... but I just went back through the posts since the NY open. Care to guess how many people posted charts of live trades (other than myself)?

Two.

Come on, people - I've been trading ALF on a live account since March and have not lost my house yet (in fact, I've made some pips) and I'm a terrible trader.

I posted on this subject once before (may have been on the original ALF thread) - I'll dig it up and repost that rant again. One deathless line from that post sticks in my mind, though:

"Wanting to be a trader and only trading demo is like aspiring to be a real estate investor and only playing Monopoly...".

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I think IT_Candles complement the ALF in a superior way.

But as far as just the candles, fractal candles are magical. I am experimenting on higher TF setups, will update here once I reach anything conclusive.

I have a low priority request for fractal candles, (maybe a next weekend project).

Can you please make the fractal chanel lines optional too!

Mucho gracias

--- 帖子 #724 ---
OK

Guess I must be trading these IT candles wrong. I am on Alpari uk and took a long on close of green IT candle above brn 1.2207 at 10.30am. No red candles have appeared only some black inbetween green so I have remained in the trade and price is now 1.2330 on 15 min chart. Should I have got out on black rather than wait for red and got back in again when

candle turned green again.

Hi Lou,

I trade live with a non MT4 broker, I use Mt4 for charting with your great system, have been following in the background for a couple of months and live trading the system for about one month! Its working for me, there are conflicts between your ALF system and the ALF I have been using with the Laguerre RSI filter on Marketscope 2.0 platform, however I prefer your latest addition the IT Candles!!! They work great!!

Keep up the good work, I will try and post some more trades as they come.

Wayne Jackson is the voice of reason, experience and success.... Thanks for the reminder...  I love this from his blog...

"I am a Trend Trader

EVERYONE SHOULD TEST OUT THIS VERY UNUSUAL AND RARELY USED STRATEGY;

1. buy/ sell ONLY in the direction of the major trend and

2. buy/sell on dips.(Use support lines to guide you as to price...also "round" numbers ... I also use the 50% Fib ratio..)

3. bank your profits

Firstly, how do you know what the trend is?

DETERMINE THE TIME FRAME THAT YOU WANT TO TRADE.

1. If the graph on the chart starts in the bottom left hand corner and ends in the top right hand corner, the market is going UP.

2. If the graph on the chart starts in the top left hand corner and ends in the bottom right hand corner, the market is going DOWN.

3. If you are still confused, print it off and show it to a 5 year old...they will get it right EVERY time...LOL

The trend is the BEST friend you will ever have in the Forex market.When you trade with the trend, even if you make a mistake, the market will get you out of your problem....If you make a mistake and you are fighting the trend ...YOU ARE STUFFED, BIG TIME !!!"

i have been trading on ALPARI UK demo account for 3 months, tryed all sorts of setups but ALF system seems to be the best yet.

being stupid i dont understand when u traders talk about taking 5 pips 10pips sometimes whith only a 2 candle moverment how r u making money because when i place a trade it would have to move at least 5 candles before i am in profit. i have made profit with this system but no real money because by the time its got in profit the trend is changing either way

this is my first post so take it easy

ALF_Alert will send a pop up, a sound, and an email when PA opens below/above ALF.

It does this by looking at the previous bar to see if that bar closed above/below. Since the prior close rarely differs from the subsequent open by more than a pip this will work almost all the time.

What about when ALF is flat? Will it still send an alert?

Unfortunately, it will. Trying to find a reliable way to prevent ALF_Alert from sending signals when ALF is flat is what took me so long to code the indicator.

I was unable to solve this in a satisfactory way. I could explain in detail the things I tried, but every attempt resulted in a potentially missed signal, so in the end my reasoning was "better too many alerts than too few". The human brain is truly remarkable - we can look at a flat ALF and recognize it in a fraction of a second but many, many lines of code will still occasionally make mistakes...

The arrows that appear along with the alert are optional - you may turn them on/off on the Inputs Tab.

Hi Lou,

I've been using the ALF method since about page 3 of your original thread. After trying it in demo for a week, I went live and am currently up a bit over $35,000 on ALF trades alone. I have updated the indicators as you changed them and resisted adding anything else (much) to my ALF charts. I downloaded the IT Candles and put them on a chart, but for the life of me I don't see much improvement. I have them on a Euro 15 min chart, and right beside it I have another 15 min Euro with the Fractal Candles. I switch back and forth quickly, but just don't see any additional information being provided by the IT Candles.

Of course, there is nothing wrong with them, they show the ALF crosses and turn colors, but so do the Fractals. They just don't provide any additional information to my eyes. So what am I missing? Just what do the new IT candles tell us that the Fractals leave out? Inquiring minds want to know!

Thanks,

Dick

Oh, and thanks for the system as well. I've shown it to several struggling traders and they seem to be able to make it work where other more complex methods baffle them.

Ditto.

The Post#1 version seems to be better right now.  Coz I am "missing" the improvements of the IT Candle.  Hope I can be enlighten as well.

Great work, LouG.

I am sure, one of these days, I will be able to trade and win with this ALF as well.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Lou, pls disregard my post numbers. I actually have quite a bit of experience designing indis. Designing, not coding.

I like your thread very much. I appreciate the simplicity of what you're trying to do here. And so I joined FF just now so that I may try to contribute something beneficial to the ongoing discussion.

OK, so here's how I'd code the indi to indentify an unwanted range: Make it so that the indicator counts the number of past candles that cross the ALF line. This would be an open user-defined parameter. Say it's set to "3". That being the case, should 3 candles ever cross the ALF simultaneously then no alerts would be given, at least not until that chain of candles was finally broken by one that didn't touch the ALF at all. Of course, the higher the number the less alerts there would be. IMO 3 sounds just about right.

Hope that makes as much sense to you as it does me.

Best,

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Can you share something more about your trading with ALF i.e., pairs, TF, entries and exits?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
The IT_Candles are still an experiment and whether or not they are better in a quantifiable way may not be known for quite a while. My goal for a companion indicator to ALF was to find something that represented "outside the box" thinking rather than using the same old 10-20 workhorse indicators (almost all of which are based on moving averages of some flavor). To my mind, conventional indicators equals conventional results and I was looking for something better, and I still am.

I almost began the initial ALF thread with ALF as the only indicator (and I still believe that anyone who has taken to time to learn about basic market dynamics can trade very successfully with ALF alone). I added a companion indicator because I am practical by nature and realize that that level of involvement is not a realistic expectation and I wanted to make trading effectively available to more people.

I'm glad you are having good success with the method.

Best,

Lou

Took this trade on demo.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Hi guy, I am looking at this system for some time now. Major problem is whipsaws taking out the stops. I have been using another method to follow the intraday/session trend to take my trades.

In the ALF chart, add EMA 62 and EMA 13. Here are the rules for the ALF trading.

Long:

Make sure the candles are above EMA 62 (the blue line maybe far up or close to EMA 62). Second confirmation, EMA 13 must be above EMA 62.

Only take long trade based on ALF if the above conditions are met.

Short:

Candles are below EMA 62 and EMA 13 below EMA 62. Take short once ALF entry satisfied.

No trades:

If EMA 62 and EMA 13 are too close or intervining. Usually during quite market session. Let it move apart. Hardly happens due to price piercing through either side of EMA 62.

Hope this will help any whipsaws. Best for 15M time frame

Additional info:

EMA 62 will act as support/resistance similar to ALF line. It can be used as a guide to take profit of refrain from entering a trade.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
I have spotted major different with indicator IT Candles and Fractal Candles SR. With ITC, all candle's body will be in either green or black when upside/over ALF line and, either red or white in downside/below ALF. Fractal Candles doesn't shows this..can somebody confirmed these...

"Do not trade when ALF is flat and PA is cycling back and forth through ALF in a narrow range (20-30 pips or less)."

Nice thread Lou, ALF is simple and effective.  How long did you analyze this one?

--- 帖子 #765 ---
"I almost began the initial ALF thread with ALF as the only indicator (and I still believe that anyone who has taken to time to learn about basic market dynamics can trade very successfully with ALF alone). I added a companion indicator because I am practical by nature and realize that that level of involvement is not a realistic expectation and I wanted to make trading effectively available to more people."  - Lou G

Couldn't agree more. I just thought I was missing something obvious. I more or less ignored the TVI from the start, focusing on PA and ALF.

For those who ask how I trade, read post #1 of this thread. That's exactly what I do, no ups, no extras. I trade all the majors (9 pairs). Go long above ALF, go short below ALF. The solution is NOT more indicators, it is using what is in front of you already. More indis equals more confusion, more reluctance to pull the trigger. If you have more than 3 indicators on your chart, you have too many. Use ALF and which ever of Lou's candles you like and follow the system. Easy Peasy.

One thing I think a lot of traders need to get used to is losing more. If a trade doesn't work out, close it down quick and go the other way on the next signal. If you lose 5 or 6 in a row, you still take the next trade. My win percentage is about 47%, but my average loss is less than 9 pips and my average win is 44. Just keep taking the trades as they present themselves and let the market tell you if you are right or not.

Wholly agree with you....I had the 62 ema on my chart before your recommendation but hadn't considered the 13 ema till now....might get less trades, but less of the dreaded whipsaws.   Trading is mainly psychological and this seems to give one an advantage over the ranging markets.  "Why take a beating when you don't have to?"

The 62 ema is a great S/R level (in my experience) and it can enhance the filtering process....really appreciate your input....look forward to more....!!

Not sure what good my charts would do anyone.  They are mostly just the ALF and Fractal Candles.  Just finished trading for the night, took 23 on the Pound, 14 on the Euro (got out much too soon, what else is new?), 38 on the pound/yen and 30 on the euro/yen.  I took the signals on the Euro and Pound, and took the Yen trades before they reached the ALF.  Most of the time, when the mothership starts to move, the rest follow along.

Well, I posted a few others this year. I got bored and did something else for a couple of years. Got back in FOREX about 18 months ago.  A friend asked me to look at a thread about an EA he was enamored of, so I traded it for a while. Decided that the risk/reward balance wasn't right and I noticed the ALF thread. I tend to follow threads quietly until I get bored with them, but this one has kept my interest.

Hey Lou G,

Firstly many thanks for sharing such a system with community. I have been trading live on this system since two weeks and had mixed kinda results. What I am basically struggling with are the valid signals turning out to be failure. I am still trying to figure out the best moves, patterns, combination etc. So it would be great if you could post some charts from your daily trading (the way you do normally) and also explain why you took a certain trade after a signal and why you didn't considered another signal.

Lastly here are some of my trades from today.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I think you are using good MM, exits are more important than entries.

At what point you decide that the trade is not going in your favour and pull the trigger and take the loss? Or do you use SL and/or trailing SL?

PS: you seem to come up with new signature with every post.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Dear Lou,

i have tested the ALf_alert now for 2 days on all different kind of pairs.

the problem is that it basicly gives a lot of Alerts when Alf line is flat. and when the ALF line is bending it only sometimes gives an alert.

is there not a way to have ALF alert working only when the ALF is bend like 10% for example. that way we would filter out a lot of bad signals.

ofcourse the problem then is. can it be programmed like that?

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Hi Lou,

The 1 HR trend is up, however, the 15 min charts is more bearish. Which is the correct direction then? Took this long now. Is this trade valid? Alf is flat thogh/

Took this short. Any comments?

Comments too pls?

Entered on the ORANGE arrow.  By the book, should I close with -8 loss when the PA touch the ALF and changed color?

I also noticed that during when the ALF is "flat" when PA starts to peel away.  But then, PA sometimes returned to ALF immediately?

Help please?

Hi,

Closed the previos eurusd trade for a loss of - 12 pips.

PA moved through ALF and closed. Anyway i could have avoided this trade? It looked pretty good at the time.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
The entry looks perfect as per the rules. A long red candle closed below ALF and the next candle still red, a good point for entry.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
No, you don't need to read the old thread - just Post #1 of this one.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Why did you close it? I would suggest to trade EU with a SL at least 30 pips, less is never safe. And I personally always use a hard stop, never close any trades manually.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Thanks, Dick - I could not have said it better (although I've tried many times).

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Got lucky and came out with +14 pips!  Thanks LouG.

Kindly see the entry/exit I made.  Almost closed it when PA almost touched the ALF.

Although have the same lost trade as teknoesen on above EURUSD.  -9 pips.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
I've been looking at the charts you all have posted - most seem to have the idea.

Be very careful about not trading when ALF is flat and range is small - this will eat your lunch every time.

If you are trading IT_Candles, be sure you wait until the candle is red/green before you enter.

New poster (but sharp trader) Dick is right - if the trade goes bad (color change, etc.) close it out - no need to force trades - there will be another one coming soon. I would qualify that only a bit - look at your profit thus far - if very little (or none) get out immediately - if in profit, see where you are in relation to ALF. If moving away nicely (up until now) you may want to give it a little more room.

I respectfully disagree with Indrek - stops were not meant to be hit. They are there to save you when your DSL goes down, etc.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
On EU seems a bit flat on H1 at the moment but H4 is resoundingly up. I will be looking long for right now.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Several are not happy with ALF_Alert as it throws a signal whenever PA crosses ALF. That's what it's supposed to do - up to you to qualify the trade (is ALF flat? is the cross in the direction of the trend? Etc., etc.).

Alerts are for people who cannot watch the market closely (like when they are at work).

If you can devote 3-4 hours a day to actively trading (meaning put in screen time) you will not need/want alerts).

--- 帖子 #789 ---
LouG,

Just for a guide, based on your experience, what is "small"  range for EU m15?

Observations and questions:

1.  The PERFECT setup would have been when 2nd RED candle is "clear" from ALF.

During the first red candle, when it closed, ALF is still pointing up?

When the second red candle opens, is it considered "too far" off the ALF already?

2.   For the 2nd entry for SELL, is the candle marked a good entry?

But, I noticed that the PA just came form zig zagging the ALF, and in fact it did go pass/back the ALF right after.

Also, noticed that ALF is flat.  Even up to the last candle posted when the PA seems like going down already.

What's wrong with my interpretation?  Pls help?

... for the news mayhem to settle:

Another member asked why I cut the first thread off at 1000 posts. Because no one wants to read a 1000 post thread - I will probably cut this one off around that point as well. We are pushing on toward 800 posts and I am already answering the same questions over and over because no one has the time/inclination to read the thread for hours on end.

This is a simple method and, by that time, I will have explained everything you need to know about the "mechanics" of the method. Once the fundamentals are understood, you must teach yourselves (and so must I).

Get out there and trade 50 cent pips (or even 10 cent pips) until you gain experience - and that is the only way I know of to gain it. Trading is more than the lines and arrows on your chart - you need to learn to deal with the fear, indecision and greed that are also part of the bigger picture. If you were learning to play golf, you would need to hit 10,000+ balls before you learned the coordination necessary to trust your swing - same thing here.

IMHO.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
It is a matter of trading style and taste really  I prefer either stops or targets be hit, and my targets for small tiemframes like M15 are usually at least twice bigger than stops. But if scalping 10-15 pips per trade, it would be, of course, dangerous to set SL at 30.

I will not touch the matter again, I promise

Hi

If I am not wrong your positive trades turned into negative.

I was also into same trades. But I made +5s every time. I always target 5 pips. There has been no looser for me till now from last week.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Whats the SL you use if TP is 5?

--- 帖子 #814 ---
I do poor MM. SL is always 20 pips. But I use your indicater to filter the trades. +5s are available with this system any time of the day. But I always filter it with your indicator. I forgot to thank you. So many many thanks for your support.

Thanks

I'll get to you - I'm trading right now

--- 帖子 #816 ---
As it turned out, I got in long again for +20 leaving me down 5 pips on the day.

Scorecard for this week - Monday +10, Tuesday +20, Wednesday -5.

Indrek was right (on this day, facing this market) - I would have had a decent day if I had held on to my first trade. Ah, hindsight...

Buying enthusiasm I anticipated did not materialize, but the good move WAS up (as expected).

--- 帖子 #819 ---
I get the feeling from the tone of some posts that a few of the newer people were expecting a lot more in the way of pips and that gains of 10-20 are small potatoes.

Nothing could be farther from the truth, IMHO. Consistent small profits (with the occasional huge trend thrown in as gift) are the only way to make money as far as I know.

Believe me, those +10-20 days really add up over time - the real challenge is to remain consistent. As we used to say when I was in the military, "stay frosty".

Threads get inundated with indiactors as time goes on, with some charts looking like Christmas trees. For that reason, I hesitate to post my current chart as I use some additional ones. Someone earlier mentioned adding 62 and 13 EMAs to avoid whipsaws. To see for myself, I added those to my chart, and find that while they would avoid whipsaws, the entries appear to be a little late in the game.

Pilotui has previously posted on an indicator he uses, and I have found it to be excellent to avoid the whipsaws. This also gets you in a little later than using the straight Alf line, but not as late as the two EMAs mentioned above. So I don't clutter the board with charts of more indicators, anyone interested in Piltuis indicator can PM me, or him, as I'm sure he'd be gracious enough to email it to you. Or, you can probably find it by clicking the papoer clip up top.

But.....as already mentioned, if the line is flat, just don't trade it. Certain times of the day like now, trading dries up because people are at lunch, sipping martinis or whatever.

This is just my personal opinion. Others may have their own. If you're going to trade, demo until you understand the system, and then trade live for pennies. with demo, you do things you won't trading live, even if just for pennies. IBFX lets you enter a trade at .01. Do that until you show a profit, and then go to .02, .05., .10 until you have mastered the sytem and can then risk 1% of your account on one trade.

I have the system down fairly well, and I wouldn't risk even that 1% yet.

Of the many trading systems on forex factory, this is one of the best for its simplicity and potential for small, steady gains.

you and Lou bring some good common sense to this thread and to this forum.ALF like Lou said from John Ehlers is simply Oscillator like

(overbought oversold) . Also trade micro lots to get used to trading like Lou said and others. less pressure than using standard lots .

Hi everybody!

Lou, thank you very much for this great system!

You said that you're still working on it, still trying to find a better indicator or improve the candles. I understand that ALF is very important and it is almost perfect, but the second indicator can be improved or replaced. Could you please take a look at Nonlagdot? Nonlagdot doesn't repaint, I mean it can change the color when the candle is forming (but it does it not very often), but when the candle is closed it doesn't change.

The picture (GBPJPY H-1) shows that the orange and blue dots allow to stay in the trade much longer than candles and this means bigger profits.

Maybe you could create a new candles indicator using Nonlagdot? Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hello,

First, thanks Lou for the method and answering questions.  Can I please get feedback on the trade?  I took the sell at the yellow dot.  It looked very similar to the other yellow dot entry a while back.

The PA broke out of the 20-30 range cycle, London has opened, I waited til the candle closed below the ALF, trend was very much down.  I couldn't have just jumped in earlier because it was still cycling in the range, so that's not a reason for the failed trade.

Thanks for everyone's help.

Rolleddice,

IMHO two things to look at:-

1. Your entry was tooo late. The candle that crossed ALF (2 candles earlier) was red and so the entry was on the close of that candle. Although ALF is flat the general trend is down. Trade good for ~ 20pips.

2. When you entred it was right at the London open where anything can happen. More often than not London traders try to reverse the direction of the Asian session.

Many in the original ALF/TVI thread used a non-lag moving average that worked almost identically to NLdots. I don't think it caught on as a replacement for TVI/ALF candles, since non-lag is so spastic.

Check out bbolss's thread if you want to catch more pip movement.

Hi Lou

First of all thanks for the system. I'm enjoying using it.

I have a question regarding trade entry. I've attached a picure which shows Alf is very flat, If anything moving up Slightly, but the PA is down and Alf is not reacting at all (Gbp/Jpy), Is this a no trade scenario.

Thanks

I think P/A has just answered my question, but I'd appreciate your thoughts.

Took +10 long on the 13:00 bar just entering green candle above ALF.

Exit at around 1.2400 because there may be contention at the big round number - don't want to be a part of it...

--- 帖子 #852 ---
ALF never follows immediately but it does eventually (if a trend develops). That's the way it's supposed to work. When PA is ranging, it follows closely and vice-versa.

I originally thought (based on my testing at the time) that the slope of ALF was a factor - not so, that has been deprecated since early in the first thread. PA is always the best indicator on your chart - it has zero lag and will always tell you what's happening (if you look at it in tandem with S/R).

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Dead in the water right now. I would consider long above 1.2410 (if it has some enthusiasm behind it).

on H4 charts. To add a touch of sobering reality...a counterbalance to my large TP type, "astounding," results type trading, etc., etc. This month I am being slammed on H4 charts. It is not Alf. It is not my approach. It is the market. Nothing works all of the time...FWIW...My best advice to all...TRADE SMALL...In doing so you will more likely have the nerve, and the cash to get through difficult periods.  Pippo

--- 帖子 #861 ---
This system has really helped me. I am sticking with this one. I have been very guilty of jumping from one system to another looking for the perfect one. Even when I found this thread I thought "It can't be that easy". So I added CCI, MACD, MAs etc. trying to add some "assurance" to this system. What this did was make me miss trades or get into trades too late.

An amazing thing happened when I took all the squiggly lines and junk off my screen. I could see price action. I keep reading how price action is king but I always felt like it was too hard for me to understand. It is too hard to understand if you are trying to see it through squiggly lines, meters, arrows and all the other nonsense I fill my screen with.

Thank you for this system. I am sticking with this until I fully understand it. Maybe this is the first step of twelve steps to fix my indicator addiction.

No, thank you - I feel vindicated. The experience you describe is exactly what I went through.

Lou et. al.,

Simple question from a long-time lurker, first-time poster.

How do you determine the lot size to use when trading using the ALF system? I'm trying to find a good method by which to choose the volume I trade once a bar "crosses" the ALF and you get an alert indicating that a movement may occur.

Clearly this is a question each person must find an individual answer to (one should only trade relative to what you're willing to lose). With that said, I'm looking for a method by which determine the strength of a potential move without using MACD / Stoc (and only using ALF).

The "first bar" which indicates the PA doesn't necessarily seem to be a reflection of how many pips one may rake in.

Thoughts appreciated.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Hi Nick,

Thank you for your response.  As I mentioned in the post, I couldn't have entered right away because the PA was in a tight 20-30 pip rage, and post #1 says no entry.  For the London tip, I understand.

Lou, can you please comment as well and let me know if I missed something?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Excellent - it's fun trading London session

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Not much to say. You were in a tough spot and did the best you could.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Here is my first live trade on EU.

I decided to learn this using live acct but small lot size. My approach is to take quick profits (in this case +13p) and small SL (in this case +10p). There is probably more upside to this trade. If I get confident I will start raising lot size. My target is to get this to a point where I can take 30-40 pips daily with 3% risk (this is actually how I successfully use my other technique for GU). Actually, if I can get a handle on this it will be a great complimentary method to trade EU while waiting for a signal on my GU method.

Suggestion for Lou G.

Awesome indicator. Love it...

Would it be possible to create something like #SignalBars where we could maybe see multiple time frame ALF data - if price is above ALF, slope of ALF, IT candle color, plus anything else.

My thinking is because I look at multiple time frames on the EURUSD, 1, 5, 15, 30, 1h and it had me realize maybe we don't need all these other indicators to look for good entries. Maybe we need to look at the ALF line in say the 30m window to see if it is flat and not take a trade. Maybe all the indicators can be ALF, but just looking at data from other periods as confirmation.

Doing this may help us spot certain patterns of when to trade or when not.

As for an EA idea, not an automated EA that enters your trade but something that trails the stop at ALF or a certain level, or closes the trade on color change. Nothing would need to be automated to enter the trade, we could keep that human, but something to exit could be cool. Calling all coders  I'm working on a trailing stop EA, but wouldn't know how to grab ALF or color bar changes. I'm not that good.

Just a few suggestions from a lurker. Maybe we will get some ideas flowing about this. Hopefully this doesn't break your rule of talking about other indicators because this is all ALF

Thanks...

Right click on the chart you are on. From that menu chose "Save as Picture".

Then it will ask you where you want to save, I save in "My Pictures" for easy reference. You can open this picture and edit it or add notes, arrows or whatever you want.

When you start your posting in here (FF) click on Attachments at the top, then a little window (Manage Attachments) will pop up. Click on "Choose File". Then go to where you saved the file, in my case it would be my documents then my pictures. When you find it then click on it, its name would appear under the small window "File Name" then click "Open". You will automatically be back in the attachments window and the name of the file should be next to one of two "Choose file". Click on the top "Upload".

Come back to your posting and click again on "Attachments" then click on the name of the file and it would be uploaded on your posting. It shows as

[ATTACH}............] When you "preview Post" you should be able to see the chart there. If you are satisfied then submit for all of us to see. :^)

There you go, step by step.

Can you tell me the time frame you used?

--- 帖子 #877 ---
This indicator overlays the ALF line from other time frames.

Add it to your experts/indicator folder, restart Metatrader and drag it to a chart. You need to set TimeFrame in INPUTS, where you can also change the line colour.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
A good way to show your trades on charts is to simply go to the account history tab of the mt terminal window and drag whichever trade you wish to show onto the main chart window. everyone can then see your exact entry and exit.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
I suggest you look at different time frames by simple switching using the icons on the tool bar. I do this at the beginning of each trading session (and sometimes during), until I find the TF that looks the most tradable to me - sometimes a chart that looks very choppy (long wicks, alternating up/down bars) will make a lot more sense at a lower TF.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
... down towards the arbitrary 1000 post limit I impose on threads. Get your burning questions in early.

I feel that my participation becomes less and less essential as time passes. I begin threads with a clear idea of the information I have available to share and, once I have shared it, there's not a great deal more I have to do.

As they used to say in old Western movies, "My work here is done".

In addition, I find that the time I spend on this has a negative impact on my own trading.

Above is a screenie of two back-to-back market moves that worked in my favor. For a little while there I thought I wasn't going to do too well (during retracements on the downturn), but overall it turned out in my favor.

I've tried it on M15 and M30, and M5 produced more pips today than the others.

M1 was the least successful. There's a probability of making pips, but it's likely too choppy, IMHO.

We must spread our wings at some point and fly on our own and with your help many of us will succeed if we don't complicate the process. The method is sound, it's just our lack within that hurts us.

Very cool system, the simplest the better.

I didn't took any trades with this system yet, but just seeing all of those screenshots and the past oportunities on the chart, i think one of the most powerfull PA sign to have a good entry is the 1-2-3 pattern, most of the time of your entries had a clear 1-2-3 pattern supporting the cross, most powerfull on 15m.

IMHO, one of the better "filters" for this Method of Action is an SMA 38 (HL/2).

It will approximate the ALF on the next higher time frame.

Do not short when the 38 MA is pointing above a 3 o'clock position, etc. etc.

Thanks to Lou and ALL who have put time and effort into this thread. I continue to be amazed at the generosity and a desire to help by so many who post on Forex Factory. May you all be incredibly wealthy !

Lou,

If you do leave, I predict within 2 or 3 weeks all the charts being posted will look like TradeRunners, except with 3 or 4 more moving averages on the main screen and the CCI, Stochastic, MACD and maybe a couple more on the bottom.  Traders just don't trust simplicity and demand complexity.  I'm not sure why, but it seems to happen to every method that anyone talks about.  Thread after thread has gone that way, and none have improved the performance of the original idea.  Oh well.

I trust everyone with multiple indicators got 200 pips from the Swissie a couple of nights ago, plus 150 on the Pound and another 100 on the Euro.  All clean, obvious ALF crosses.  That was a real good week's trading in about four hours real time.

Lou, give up trying to find a complementary indicator to the ALF, it doesn't need it.  Go back to trading and make a lot of money.  Your threads will die of indicator overload, but a few of us will think kindly of you whenever we bank a nice profit.

Thanks,

Dick

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Despite what Dick has said below...and it's his opinion

I have had several requests for my latest template.  (make sure you have downloaded AdaptiveLaguerreFilter.mq4 and Instant_Trend.ex4)

Attached is a zip file with all my custom indy's which I have spent the last 48 hours back testing on the LFH Simulator.(just type it in the search box on FF)  I'm not going to make an outrageous claim like I made 35K trading only the ALF (Dick) without proof...

So please download the simulator and test it out this weekend. (To force myself to be honest, I'll pick a random month in from 2007 on and test my trading) Then you'll be ready to go London Open Monday.

Please note the only active email alerted indy is the green line (Elucidated indy) when it crosses it's mid-line...then just follow my on-screen checklist.

I won't be starting a thread for my approach to Lou's system, but if someone wants to feel free. (I just don't have the time)

Lou, this will be my last non-trade related post on this thread.

Once again please email me with questions.

Hi, Lou.  Great system and great thread ... thank you for your skill, wisdom, patience, and your mission to help others.

I've just come across a small problem with the IT Candles indicator, which I'm hoping you can easily fix.

Having set the indicater's color width settings, and saved these as a template, when the template is loaded onto another currency chart, the color width settings are not retained.

Can you look at the indicator and fix this?  Hope so.  Regards, Richard.

P.S.  The width seems to be fixed at 5 ... does this make sense or help your investigation at all?

P.P.S.  You'll see the same effect (returning to a width of 5) if you change the timeframe on the chart.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Of course you're right about the onset of "indicator madness". Don't know the psychology underlying that and probably better I don't...

It's part of my nature to never be satisfied with anything but I'm running out of road in the companion indicator search and will end up doing as you suggest - give it up and simply trade and make pips.

Thanks for your contribution to the thread.

See you in the short line,

--- 帖子 #920 ---
You're right, I really don't need all those indi's/MA's on the chart. However I'm (1) transitioning from another method which is very similar and I like to compare and (2) I'm a "visual" trader that likes things to come together and scream at me "take this trade".

Does that really make me less of a trader? If we don't need indicators and MA's then why use candlesticks (an indicator) and ALF (very similar to an 8 MA).

If an indi can help me spot something that I otherwise might have missed (a divergence perhaps) is that indi really just a useless piece of crap?

I guess it all boils down to an individual's method and personal preference.

If I have offended Lou or anyone for posting a chart with too many indicators then I offer my most humble apology. But I'll probably be keeping some of them.

After using IT_Candles in real life, I've come to the conclusion that it represents no real improvement over Fractal_Candles so this weekend I will be customizing the latter for my own use and getting down to the business of trading and making pips - which is what you should be doing as well. Forget about newer and better (and more) indicators on the chart - there's no substitute for simply trading to learn how the market works.

Best regards to all,

Lou

Hey guys take it easy....

There's nothing wrong for adding more indicator as there's also nothing wrong with using alf alone as recommended by lou here.

Just add as many  indicator as you need to make you more comfortable to take the next trade. Nothing is wrong with that. Good trader or not, is not being judge by how many or how less indicator you use in your system but with how well  you can survive and making profits in long term in this Forex business with the system you decided to use. Just keep it to yourself.

As for this thread, since Lou wanted to keep the system in this thread to be as simple as he pointed out, then we have to respect his decision. At least as long as he is here with us. He's the owner of this thread.  And he can take this thread to wherever he needs to make his point. For me, I think he did it very well.

If Lou (as the owner) decide to move on and stop babysit this thread, like he just did, then I believe it means people can do whatever they want to do in this thread in the future.

Hey Lou... I look forward for your next alf version !

I can see a "Tetris game" in your next alf system you just post.

That's fun!

--- 帖子 #923 ---
No indicator will work when the price is ranging. You are bound to get whipsawed no matter how good the indicator is.

Best is to "predict" where the price will reverse or continue. Just draw the daily pivot lines (PP, S1, S2, S3, R1, R2, R3 and the midlines). Also keep an eye on the daily range. If any of the PA hits the lines, it will range for few candles before reversing/resuming to the next line.

Once the daily range exceeds, chances are high it will pull back or range until the next session.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Thank you for this indicator.

But I noticed the setting of lookback is set at 15, while the LouG-ALF is set at 20?

Anyway, "how do we interpret" the m15 ALF line if we put it in m5 charts?

I saw the MTF-ALF chart of LouG - looks neat, but I dont know how to interpret it and make good use of it?  Hoping someone will help.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Now.. now !! There we go, trying to interpret too many indicators again.

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hahaha, no sir!

It's the same good ol' ALF of Master LouG, only in MTF.

Kindly see the post of LouG himself - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=907

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Then carry on and the pips will be with you !! You are paying attention while I have been distracted. Best of luck !

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Lou G's next pending ALF is 1 ALF indicator line with multi tf bars displayed.

If you used that ALF-MTF.ex4, its 1 set of bars with multiple ALF indicator lines.

The MTF lines normally show as stepped lines. I had to restrict their display on higher time frame charts.

Both look very interesting and do add a bit to the single ALF indicator alone.

Lou, thanks once again for all your work & effort in running your threads.

Hoping you go for opening another thread.

cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #929 ---
For anybody who wishes to experiment with displaying the bars of other time frames, try this indicator found on codebase.

Under input tab you need to set the timeframe using the correct format e.g. M15 (note the capitalization).

Adjust the colours as you see fit.

Candle Number relates to how far back on your chart it overlays the bars.

Note: it appears to show the body of the bar, not the wicks. They are only showing bulls and bears, not Lou's adjusted candles

You need to add "Candles2.mq4" into /experts/indicators and "drawing.ex4" into /experts/libraries

--- 帖子 #930 ---
Thanks for the candle2 but you forgot to attach drawing.ex4.  It does not work without it?

Hi, I have been a fan since the first thread, but have been focused on trading not talking.   All this back and forth about other indicators has drawn me out to offer my useless 2 cents.

From what I have learned about life there are two sides of this extra indicator debate, those who want more indicators and those who offer more indicators.  People, especially newbes all know how well they trade (lets face it, if they had all the answers, they wouldn't be on this site).  They all think that they know how well others trade (I am guessing that they feel that others trade better than they do) so anything that someone else uses possibly is better than what they are using, and if they switch, then they will start to trade as good as the others are.  So there will always be the desire to add (or at least try out) another indicator, especially if had helped someone else.  Hay we all tried out Lou's indicator, how do we know that the one that the next guy posts isn't just as good (can't say, "or better", because at this stage I don't think that that is possible, ALF/IT candles is the bomb!)

On the other side of the coin, is the offering of indicators.  The nature of this site is the very reason that that occurs.  This site is intended in the most altruistic fashion.  It is a free site that is intended to get fellow traders together and discuss what is working and what isn't.  There is no reason to join, other than to find help, and to offer help.  Lets take our humble thread master Lou.  He has given 110% to help people who he doesn't know, can not possible profit from them and has even taken flack from them, all in the effort of helping the fellow trader.  Everyone on this thread who has offered some form of a comment has done so with the only intent of helping someone else.  That is what makes this thread and this site great in my opinion.  Sure, Lou could have packaged up this method, put some horrible cheasy name on it and marked it and make off quite nicely, but his intent is one of a much more nobler calling.  People have found something that make sense to them and they just want to let others in on their thoughts.  So they post their thoughts on their indicator selection.  It is the side of human nature that I like.

So there will always be the addition of extra indicators, I don't see it as a slight to Lou, but rather an opportunity for others to contribute.  We have all been taught that nothing in life is free, and the offering of ideas is one simple way that readers can earn their keep.

k, now back to trading

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Hello everybody. First I would like to thank Lou oh so very much for this system! You're a champ, Lou. Second, I can't seem to get the IT candles to work on my mt4.  It shows up in the indicators list but when I add it to my chart it shows nothing. Anybody know how to remedy this situation, please and thank you?

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Guess someone has to be the first to start the topic. With the first brokers starting to demo/beta the mt5 platform, in what time span do we need the indicators to be available for mt5? Is there someone here in this thread that is already familiar with mql5 and knows how to converse the mql4 into mql5? Some say that it will take a long time before brokers will start using mt5 live, I guess it's better to be prepared.....

Hi Viperone, you also need the instant trendline indicator in the indicators folder for it to show the candles. note that It does not have to be added to a chart for the candles to show it's just that the itcandles indicator references it.

hope this is the solution.

Hi viperone,

Did you install ALF from the indicators list?

bcarbon

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Are you using primarily 5M t/f? which pairs also?

thanks

jacob

--- 帖子 #942 ---
Yes... but it's just my preferrence I guess.

I tend to missed some action if using higher TF.

Trade mainly EU. EJ sometimes, only when it line up with EU.

Btw... I banked another 27 pips yesterday with 3 trades.

I believe I could do more but 20-30 pips a day is my daily target.

Only trade after London and before Europe closed.

Just my 2 cents here. Anybody who want to succeed with this Alf baby, should learn and or at least have enough screen time

watching how a pairs move around alf line. With basic understanding of daily S/R and divergence, this Alf baby is a gold.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
I still have to learn more abou PA...

I attached my previous chart with additional note about the way my mind worked when trading with alf. I hope this share will help people who are new to this thread.

EU 5M

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Pinbar and  Divergence is my "Ace" on this trade. If you play with an Ace, you are playing hard to lose. So play only when you have an ace.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
NG..this is a great explanation...I am still very much a beginner...thanks for the lesson.

Question...how come you entered at number 3 and not wait until two more candles when closed below Alf again? Did you think it would go low at that point?

thanks,

jacob

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Why I enter on No.3.

1. It was simply because when I have candle on number 3, the rest on the right is not exist yet. Based on my humble experience, If I wait further, most time I would miss a big drop (which is not quite right on this example). I really hated that.

2. I trade only EU for some time. And from my experience of watching EU (dont know about others) the High usualy would be tested 2 times before it finally drop. That's why I usualy enter on the 3rd drop. I should've enter it right away when I have pinbar and price crossed alf on the left of the actual entry point. I saw a divergence there but I dont have the guts....Bad entry...yes

This trade is not perfect one... That's why I have to learn more about PA, especially for EU...

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Might I suggest a name change? If you use that as your name "losing", you put that into your consciousness. Much better to have a name "winningtrades", whether or not you are winning right now. You should get into the habit of a winning attitude.

[quote=Lou G;3778374]Large green candle is both H and L - that's one of the problems I'm going to work on this weekend.

Hi Lou

started 2 days ago, it´s making $.

I understand your concern with the candle colour, reminds me of the balance line trades of B. Williams, designed to get you in shortly before the fractal...Those 2 black candles you mention would have been Balance line enrties...

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Nice analysis. Do you use hard SL and what about  TP or you constantly monitor the trade as it progresses?

--- 帖子 #950 ---
I use an EA to always put my initial SL at 15, and adjust it later on if I am not comfortable. This way I can concentrate on firing.

Use 10-15 pips TP whenever I have to do something else but I prefer to monitor the trades.

I trade EU and 80% of my trades were SELL. And yes I am profitable so far.

I use basic RSI 6 to find divergence and also the usual daily pivot in another chart to monitor where the price is at.

I look my entry after I saw retracement candles like pinbar, shooting star, bearish engulfing... etc.

Yes...Sometimes my entry is sucks like the one I posted earlier..but I dont lose for three straight days.

I have not put a trade today. I am waiting for my ACE. Expecting a drop on EU pretty soon right now.....

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Here is the drop I promise you....

Hope you guys got this one....

Bail out with 10 healthy pips (Fixed TP) because otherwise price will hit Today's Open Price Level. It should bounce a bit before the next fall or jump.

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Hello NiceGuy, thx for youre helping chart screens. What is ACE plz?

--- 帖子 #953 ---
"Ace" is just my own terms for a condition to entering trades with high probability of winning.

Like in cards game... if you play with an Ace.. You are playing hard to lose game. That's why I only enter whem my "ACE" condition is met.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Thx you NiceGuy

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Hi Niceguy

I have enjoyed your recent posts....keep them coming!

Can you share the EA you use for putting on a SL....sounds like a handy thing to have

PGPB

--- 帖子 #956 ---
Thanks.. Glad if I can contribute something to this thread.

I am using THV Cave Manager EA and THV Pivots. It's part of the latest THV system. I believe you can find it easily in Trading System folder. I put the  EA, daily pivot and basic RSI 6 indicator (from MT4 default) in the same EU M5 in other chart beside the Alf chart. Yes...  I am a cheater beacuse I use another indi... But hey they are just tools.

I want the alf chart to be clean so I can concentrate on placing my trade. This alf baby is pretty powerful for entry and exit.

Here's another trade I took last night. Banked me 20 pips with this one. Should gave me more if I stay awake, but I was so sleepy.. So I use a fixed TP.

This is not good example actually, because my entry was based on:

1. Quality time I spent with EU

2. the way the price move in couple hours before which was Strong SELL

3. simply a signal from my brain.

I enter quick to keep relatively low SL with 0.1 mini lots only. I was prepared to lose this one. But I didn't.... it worked out nicely as my theory says....

My Ace on this trade is... Price hits Today's Open Level.

Actually I think it was not an ACE, maybe it was a king or queen trade ... No big lots for this one... (which I ended up regret it.. )

OK....thanks.....got the EA, I like being able to throw on a trade and have the stop loss and take profit automatically pop on.

I use pivots also....not the THV ones though

Attached is an indicator I am rather fond of.

pop it on to your charts....it is pretty self explanatory...it is kind of like RSI but with a signal line (sell when the dark line goes below 50 **AND the signal line is above the dark line...and vice versa for buys)

My wife is somewhat of an expert on spiritual and mental things. I have done a fair amount of study into that sort of thing myself. She is a practioner of visioning and Science of Mind. You are what you think you are right now. Not in the future. You don't stay with an old script until you become better. You envision yourself as a success right now, in the present. Not tomorrow when you learn that last piece of information, because "tomorrow" will never come. Even if you are 350 pounds and know you need to lose weight, you call yourself skinny and healthy because when you do that, your mind works on that and everything you do is concentrated on that success. The same thing applies to trading. If you THINK you're lousy, you are, because that's what your subconscious tells you. If you THINK you are great, you will become that. You may not make 100% winners today just by changing a name. But, in due time, you will see and picture yourself as a great trader and you will become one. Your own mind will lead you to the information, steps and confidence neededto be a success. The same holds true in reverse. The longer you picture yourself as a losing trader, even if it's just using a name lkike that, the longer you will be one. Call it a mind trick if you want. You are what you think you are. If a mind trick works, and it's been proiven over and over, why not use it. Just my little piece of non trading advice.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
This is great advice...really...I don't mind stuff like this at all. I am very much a beginner trader trying to earn enough per day to quit my lousy stinking job.

I looked at my profile details and I can't see where I can change my name. I may have to start over with a new account...but then no one will know me anymore (hehe as if they really do).

If I change my name, I might have to make an announcement on all my favorite threads

Your advice is well taken...thanks

Jacob

--- 帖子 #963 ---
This is the system I use. Thanks to Paradoxical who make the time to explain it.

Guys... Please dont start to talk how to use one indicator or another. You just chasing on the wrong direction there.

To be honest with you, and not to try to being arrogant or over confident. I trully can enter those trade without using any other indicator besides daily pivots.

Here's what I did in the past:

Keep running the MT4 charts with daily pivots on your screen with one pair and one pair only. So whenever you near your computer there's no way you will not see the  charts. At this time, dont ever put on a trades. Not even one.

If you have spare time, try to spend quality time by watching the charts. Just train your brain with the way the price move between levels. The Pivots, Open price, Support and Resistance. Learn how it bounce and pass pivots.  Just keep on watching the charts to train your brain with the price movement pattern.

After you do it for a week or a month, then make a 10 wild prediction whenever a price moving close to a nearest levels. Say it so your brain can hear it...

It is something like "The price will pass this level easily.." or "There's no way the price will pass the levels" or "  "Hey.. You will bounce this time..." . Have fun with the prediction. Let your brain hear your decision.

Write down your prediction. After 10 prediction, then see how good you are. Do it again and again. Until you become good at it. And you know what... you will. At that point just do trade with it. Let you brain say it to you.

That's why I use random entry and exit but still win. Please study my recent chart. And if you have spare time, please look my earlier post in this thread. I am kind of actually telling everybody when to enter a winning trades before it happened. I did it over and over again. Please look. Not because I have a 6th sense or use special indicator. It's simply because my brain trained to do so.

Like learning to ride a bike or to swim. Once your brain, your body and your insting  have enough training. It will stay with you for the rest of your life. The more you do it, the more you are good at it.  At some point you will master it. Then you can enter trade with a blink of an eye.

Now... here's another key.

If you have 1:1 RR, then you only need to be 51% right to make money. The more Return you put on the RR ration the less "right" you have to make to become profitable.

Just train your wild prediction to become a powerful ones. Like you train your punch to break a brick. Just dont give up. The more powerful you are, the more bricks you can break with a single blow.

You have to have fun when doing it. Keep it easy and keep on watching.  Watch and predict.

Believe in yourself.

Desi, got your private message. I can not put an image in a private message so I will answer in the thread. ....BUT to any one who thinks an indicator is going to turn your trading around you are wrong. The things that will turn your trading around are:

1/ screen time (demo trading then trading real small)

2/ money management (wins bigger than losses)

The QQE indicator shows a dark line (that is very similar to RSI)buy when it crosses above 50 and sell when it crosses below, the red dotted line MUST be below the dark blue line for buys and above the dark blue line for sells

Lots of people are trading ALF with PA (price action).....when I use the ALF method (don't always), I use ALF, PA, pivots and sometimes the QQE indicator as a filter

Hope this helps.

You got it... But this time Price climbed fast on Tokyo but all the sudden the candles gradually getting smaller. We could see buyers would not want to risk Europe open. More buyers bailed out at the same time means we can expect a real fast drop. We have to act fast or else we would lose the momentum. Time for Small lots but longer trade.

Well that's what my mind say to me. I dont know about others. If you are new to EU just dont do this. Look for safer entry point.

Been through most of this thread a couple of times.  I have a few questions.

1.  My, "alf alert," shows an, "e" instead of an arrow.  I know this isn't because of anything messed up with the indicator because this exact same things happen on other indicators I have that are supposed to show an arrow.   Does anyone know why this is happening and how I could change the, "e," to the prefered arrow.

2.  Lou often says to determine the trend just look at where alf is now in relation to the left of the chart.  BUT, is that zoomed all the way out?  Because from different magnifications the comparison can be different.

Want to thank Lou for this system!

I´ve carefully tested maybe 40 diferent things during the last 3 years..

I know Elliot and Fibos by heart,Bill W.....etc.. plus excellent software...nothing worked beyond BE...except for a RSX system with thin profits...that I still trade.

I trade Oanda, (lots are  1 $), so I adjust my lots exactly, 2 lots, each 0,5% of my account.

With Alf I use 10 pairs, 15 M and H charts.Filter simple EW ,specially carefull when against trend, then I look for divergence of W5... Up to 10 trades a day..2 hours of work.

Use an auto trail (some 2 bars below/above entry), and a 0,68 and 1,68 TP for each lot.If the first one reaches target, I make a little anyhow.

So once I put the trade, I move to the next opportunity and forget that one till its `finished.

Results on 30 trades are awsome:around 0,35 R average.

Want to see 100 trades, better 1000.

Consider this: 10 double trades a day, at say, 0,2 R, roughly 400 trades a month...makes 80 R profit (0,5%)...Then:40 % monthly??

Compound that precisely, and it´s hard not to dream of a Lamborghini (just joking, I like electric cars)..

Anyway, future will tell...it´s fun in the meantime...

Thanks again Lou...

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
Can you clarify what you mwan by "Filter simple EW"......what is EW?

You say you "use 10 pairs, 15 M and H charts", .....does this mean you have 20 charts open.....do you use the Hourly chart to help you decide what to do on the 15m

Which pairs do you trade?

One thing that I struggle with is how many pairs to pay attention to.

I want to look for the best trades, so trading multiple pairs allows me to shop for the best set up......but having so many charts open is cumbersome

If we want to use the candle opposite color change method of exiting an ALF trade, do we wait until the candle closes, or as soon as it shows any color opposite?

For instance if in a short trade, then the next candle turns green (as it starts) do I get out right then and there, or wait for it to close to confirm it's color.

My concern with exiting on color change is that it may just be fluctuation at the start of the candle and then it turns back to color in my favor. (On that same candle)

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Simply watch support and resistance. If you're long and price holds ABOVE a former resistance area, stay in to the to the next resistance area (and vice versa)

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
Does anyone have a direct answer to the color change question.

Thanks traderunner for your input, but I wanted an answer about color the color change exit, not on ways how to hold on as long as possible.

Looking at the charts of ALF I can see that a color change is often a good early exit to keep profit or make losses small.  So, that is why I need a direct answer to the question.

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Hi Traderunner,

Which pivot indicator are you using?

Thanks pbb

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Just did my first successful ALF based trade on the 15M.

Got up at 6, wanted to be ahead of the news at 7:30

It was not a text book entry, but to me it looked like a retrace and likely to continue short.

It was more or less, went against me by 11pip, then the next textbook ALF short entry ended up being very close to my actual short entry.

Went +20 then retraced, stayed in because to me it looked like it had more available short.

Eventually it retraced again and I took +30. AS of where price is now I could have held on for more, but I'd been in this trade since very early and it's already 11:00.... and +30 is very nice. And I didn't have the patience to wait through another retrace that might just reverse on me.

If any more experienced with ALF would like to give me a tip or two feel free.

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
There's price pattern that keeps repeating itself .. I only enter when that pattern appeared. If we do that we have very high probability to win. Not 100% win, but this way we will lose more rarely. Combine it with Risk<Return MM, it's gold.

Still learning the ALF ...

Question NiceGuy, on the +5 win, isnt it a bit too early to enter, when PA is still below the ALF line?

Thanks for a nice clean chart.

http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...3&d=1277746437

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Which one do you trust the most?

Alf or Price itself?

I saw the pinbar and divergence right before I enter for five pips. With this confirmation it's a enough for me to enter right away.

Alf is there to help me read the PA movement but my action is always based on the PA itself. Candles.

If you look at it closer, you will notes that there's a good chance I might not win that 5 pips if I wait the price to be above alf.

Why taking that chance?

Btw, I am a bit more aggressive than usual because I start my trade this week wit a losing one. (That -4 pips on chart)

I should not trade that way. That was bad for business.

Good luck there! Hope this helps..

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
I have few people PM me asking about the way I do my trades with alf.

This is the secret:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=970

I broke the rule here and there but somehow I almost always managed to win. This simply because I know the pairs and TF I trade with. Not because I am good or have a sixth sense or something. That's ridiculous.

It's simply my brain has recorded so much data about how the EU M5 moves and how it repeated itself in a certain pattern.

Please take a look some of my charts couple pages back.

Hope this helps.

There is a very profound quote that says "As a man thinketh, therfore he is." Some day, science will unlock the key to BELIEF, and how and why a belief in a thing can alter a humans consciousness into things far greater than he can ever imagine. Within our brains are the POTENTIAL to reach great heights. Savants have the ability to remember everything they have ever seen or read. That means that EVERYONE has this same capacity....not just savants.

Would you believe the words of a losing trader, or of a winning trader? Which choice would you make? Never mind whether that trader has been doing it for years or not. Winning is all that matters here, right? Who would want to follow a losing team? who would want to follow a failure? Who would want to emulate a failure? the answer is, of course, no one.

Follow success, think success, dream success, and take the steps necessary to LEARN success, and there is no other alternative but for you to become one, because your MIND will train you to SEE success, and be success. You must focus. You must learn LEARN the tools of the trade. This is what the poster is saying. Is he lying? You tell me.

Yes, Am I a liar? I like that!

A question for the 15M ALF traders.....

I'm finding that I'm killing myself and letting profits turn into small profits or even losers sometimes.   I had like three trades in two days that if I had just set a TP of 20, I would have hit it, before my SL which is also 20.

Today I'm trying to let a trade get to 20 and lock that in with postive SL and if it keeps going great, if it doesn't I have 20.

Twice today it went to 20, but not quite far enough for me to lock it in with a postive SL. (At ibfx, has to be 3 pips from price, so +23)   Luckily both times since I couldn't lock it in I just got out with about 15 each time.

Anyways........ so my question.

Are the 15M ALF traders finding that 20 pips is consistently hit often?   I'm thinking I may do better just setting a tp of 20 pips, instead of trying to hit home runs every time, if ALF on the 15M has lots of 20 pip winners.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Hi Kumo

Your question is a very good one....and I do not see it discussed often on FF....it really is a question of money management......I am not sure if I have the answer, but I do know that my winners need to be larger than my losers......so I always try to have larger winners than losers...but if I have a 20 pip stop loss .....how often can I get a 30 pip winner...I have adapted ALF with a system I use to trade in the direction of the trend......so I only take ALF trades in the direction of the trend.......and ....I only trade currencies that have a trend formed on the 4 hour

My favorite trades are those that go into profit right away.....but very often I will see a trade go against me by 10 or 15 pips

I don't have the answer to your question....but I do think your question is a good one

PGPB

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Ya, that's the krux of the problem.  Sure if I get a whole lot of 20 pip winners vs 20 pip losers, no problem.   But, If I could find a way to get the big runners it would make up for more of the losers and make for a better overall method.

BUT, if I hold on for the big runners I'm in danger of counter movement not being just being a small retrace and taking me out.

I'm finding the posive exit part of trading with ALF very iffy.

A candle turns opposite color and you get out, sure you've got small loss or small profit, but sometimes its just tottally reverses and goes way in your favor.

If you use the line it can play just past it and go way in your favor.

I guess I'm trying to find the best way to determine when to get out of a trade wether it's in profit or in loss.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Trade two lots....the first lot you take the 20 pips (or what ever you can get) ....the other lot you move your stop to break even and let it run.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Ya I thought about that, but uuurgh I hate doing that.  I'm more of a one trade a time guy.

And then if the initial entry goes south, thats two trades I have to try and close quick.

I'll think about it, maybe the only way to go.

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Step one....find a solution that is profitable

Step two ....increase your trade size

Step three ...quit your day job (I am not there yet by the way)

You can close a portion of your trade.....I do not know how.....anyone???

That way you place one trade.....and then close half of it when you have hit your first take profit

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
As your chart clearly shows - you closed most of the trades prematurely. Otherwise it would be a good month. So, do not blame the month, blame your trade management.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
H4 definitely needs bigger stops. I am a H4 trader myself and I have also tested ALF. I found out that it does not work on higher timeframes because it is reacting too fast. Supertrend is a perfect choice for H4 instead. It does not stop you out so easily.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
for months along with Price Channel. I abandoned ST for ALF. Back testing proved ALF better. My stops are where they should be. Hundreds of trades over 6 currency pairs are the basis for their placement.

5 wins in a row today using ALF to scalp in the 15M for a total of 59 pips.

Made up for my losses I incurred by holding on to long and trying to hit home runs every trade.

As long as I don't let winners turn into losers I think I'll do good with ALF scalping.

The entries from from a strong cross  or open past the ALF line seem to be almost always good for at least a few pips.

I think manual trade managment will be key for this to be profitable, no strict +20 or -20 risk/reward ratio here.  Just eyeing it and taking profit or cutting losers short as per judgement.

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
I can do it on my IBFX demo & live accounts by reducing the "volume:" figure after double clicking to close a trade.

Then amend the original/remaining trade SL to BE+1or 4.

But still not sure about the logic of having twice the risk on the table to start with, for what could be basicly a half trade.

I dont usually split my trades. Either close the lot early or set SL to BE+1or4 for the whole trade.

ie bank it, then "NEXT" or set SL in the green, then its "free" - well not really.

cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
K:

I agree...this alf is excellent for short term trades, smaller pip gains. i am using 5M on UJ...studying chart hard and making observations and notes so i can learn to predict what will happen.

your 5 wins for 59 pips are small wins each but big in total. It is not about making a trade for 100 pips...how often does that occur...never for me.

but, small wins add up and a pair can become somewhat more predictable for short time frames and periods by studying the patterns over time.

Hi everyone, I'm new to this post but have been read some of it. 1st thank you for this system I have made some pips with it. I Like. What I have done that LOOKS good is overlayed the Hieken Ashly and set the chart on fore ground along with a 21 Ema, smooth, shift 1, median Price.Then add t/l's as a guide on the 15M. stop set just below t/l. I scalp a little between swings when the setup allows. Ive attached my template for anyone interested.

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
I am not sure how to interpret this, but when the GREEN arrow appears, the PA is over the ALF around the HIGH of the "candle A," then it suddenly reversed.

The RED arrow appears when the "Candle B" is about at its lowest.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
How do you determine divergence?  Any other indicator you are using to determine it?

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
... That's what's happened to me when I started to doubt the candles and begin to see indicators.....

Divergence?

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
read the thread suggested by NG above. it is sweet.

your candle A is not divergence...too much action above and below open and close. not reversal coming. from your thread, you enter when below the 21 line after the second candle if 21 stays on color even after second candle is opposite. this is perfect setup for your system.

man, i am starting to see the charts instead of just looking at them.

NG...great chart.

It appears that a small pinbar can achieve a few pips win, which is always nice.

But, it also appears that a large pinbar can achieve more pips.

Question...how can one tell the difference between a small pinbar and a large pinbar?

thanks,

jacob

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
there is nothing boring about nailing 75 pips

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
That would be easy..... The size.

Just dont go with the little one, I only do it rarely with 5-10 TP max.

75 pips was easy today. Look at the chart. Market was Skyrocketing since London. More people out there earned more pips easily while some other got calle by Mr. Margin.

Damn, I just realized that EJ is a totally a different beast... This cross is wild... Trend like its brother EU but also going back and forth like its cousin UJ. Won 35 pips easily but suddenly my SL got hit 3 times in a row... Set me back about 15 pips... I must be overtrading.

I should've demo EJ before jumped in...

Not sure if anyone would have the answer for this. I had to delete my entire IBFX platform and reload it due to a virus, which included me having to delete all indicators from my folders. I readded the indicators I needed one by one. For some reason, none of the ALF indicators work. No matter what color background or pair. They show as being on my indicator list on the custon indicators and show on the chart. But, nothing shows. No Alf candles. No Alf line. No Alf Alert. Weird.

Anyone have a clue as to what might be wrong? Every indicator works except for the Alf ones.

I love this indicator. I have it setup on UJ 5M.

It lags a little...for example, it will place a divergence on a completed bar 3 candles ago.

Can we get one that does not lag? If we get one that does not lag, it can be gold.

Did you also download the indicators from the prior thread? If I remember correctly for some alf indicators you needed a certain version of the alf.

Maybe just download all alf related indys under the paperclip from those threads, hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
First I want to thank you for Alf. Nice. In case anyone is interested. Referring back to post 1061 (pg.71) I've decided to update my trade. The thick red lines box out the original snap shot area . Now the reason the trade was short at that point is: Notice the new Thick Magenta lines coming in from past Price action. Some with the RAY option off. Anyway the point is the TREND CONTINUES. IT was a good entry point to short with a tight stop And made sense if you started watching that pair reasonably soon from that point in time ( Back test). Moving forward with Patience we see the upper t/l is broken and we are out of the short trade. At this point i start drawing another lower t/l. We get one pull back BUT our moving avg is still above the price so we wait. Then a thrust up giving us a reason to draw the upper t/l " HAVING TWO POINTS LONG AT THIS POINT thats what I do!! Then another trust down and a bounce SO i go long at the next candle open IF its green put my stop a few pips below the projected lower t/l ( always taking into consideration my spread). With that being said,,,,LOOK at the 3rd snapshot, notice that we have two points now and can draw a proper lower t/l So I draw it.

Working forward on the long. I try to keep it going until making sense of the pair at hand become some what confusing.( you know what that feels like ) At that point i may decide to stand aside until another opportunity clearly presents itself. Its a trading style i like to use. i trade longer t/F's normally. This is a way for me to cut the boredom down while trades are working in the mid to long t/F's. If this benefits someone Great if you have a way to improve it share it. If you like this and whant me to share more of these types of setups say so and i will when i can. Happy trading to all of you.

And remember Patience is a virtue and is HARD TO MASTER!! IN FOREX YOU MUST HAVE THIS MASTERED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE Having Patience with others will earn you respect. Same thing with forex. The market rewards the patient.

This trade had green fractal candles on MTF on the correct side of the ALF.  Broke through a triangle and a pivot.  then I relaxed a bit as it just kept going and going.  I kind of arbitrarily closed at 50.  I like round numbers.  Anyway it may keep going, or it may turn down again, but 50 pips is way more than enough for one day   Thanks to Leo wherever you may be!  Don't be a stranger in your own thread.

Hi

I keep checking the forum everyday so keep posting. I am using the second to the last template posted by pilotui and have a small live account I am trading it on. I have been using the M15 time frame and it seems to be working out OK. When I get some more time I will start posting my trades. I am on CDST so it makes it a little hard trying to trade the London session and also going to work at a day job. I am going to try and trade 2 times a week, maybe Tuesday and Wednesday early mornings and see how it works out. I had 2 short trades Monday morning, 1 winner on EU and one loser on GP, but the winner was 5 times the loser so all worked out.

Good Luck

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
The first entry short stopped out, but the second MTF entry was good for 50 pips.

I am lucky now in that I am spending a month in Asia so can trade London and NY!  My luck geographically (and probably forexologically ) will run out when I go back to EST in the US.  Then London is like 3 or 4AM!

This is a good system.  I would like to see this thread continue even if it is just to help each other out.

Lou is probably cooking up ALF v3.0

It could be the way your broker list the pairs. With IBFX they are "EURUSDm", and other brokers are "EURUSD". If yours are listed differently than you will need to edit the mq4 file to make it work.  I had to modify it to work with IBFX because of the "m" after the pair. The original file "^Pilotui_MY_STRENGTH_v1.0.ex4" wants them to be like "EURUSD". The one I enclosed "^Pilotui_MY_STRENGTH_v1.0m.ex4 has been modified to work with IBFX. They should show up as long as you have chart history and can see candles on your chart, mine are working .

On the bottom of your chart is a indicator which says "use with close of Alf Line".  It looks like some version of an RSI indicator. When I downloaded your template and the indicators that indicator was not on the chart? Can you tell me where that came from?

Ok on your template the lines are there, but I have it loaded on eurusd and at the bottom its showing usdgbp

Edit: sorry I dont think thats your template.

Hello everyone,

I will try to make a nice simple pdf of the trading ideas

people had. If I get enough time I will post it here for everyone.

USDGBP is the default settings, check your settings. Also I think you need the Alf_Alert indicator in your indicators folder in order to display the red candles. I am also using the IT_Candles, make sure it is in your indicator folder.

The template shown looks like the one from the zip file in post 449 which is fine, the one I am using has the "Dash Board" indicator that adds a lot of the other items, this I purchased from pipware.com and is not included in anything I sent.

I am presently working on an alert that may help in not needing to be in front of the computer all the time. It is based on what has been going on in this thread. At present I am testing it with different indicators to see what works best with alf. The ones I am trying are AO, AC, Fractal, UF1, UF2, Strength, and Instant_Trendline. You can see the chart with some test readings in the upper right corner. It looks for Awesome and Accelerator to be same color, looks back the last 8 bars for the closes fractal and its direction, looks for a UF1 and UF2 cross within 2 bars of each other, looks for a cross of the Strength within the last 2 bars, and also the Instant_Trendline cross, which is the red and green MAs on the chart. Also not to forget, a close above or below the Alf line, all must agree. This may be a little tight, but I am trying to cut down on the noise.

The FracAlert number tells what bar within the last 8 bars the closes up or down fractal happened on. All these values shown are for testing and reference to see what is going on. Also when an alert takes place a screen shot is taken at that moment so I can check on it later and see just what happened at that moment in time to make any adjustments to the code. This may be just a waste of time, nothing is better than hands on trading and reading the charts yourself. Forgot one thing, the vertical wide bars are my trade window, I start at the blue one and end at the Crimson one, 6:00 to 18:00 GMT.

Would you be kind enough to share how you modified this indi? I would like to see the script for your modification to see if I can figure out a solution for my broker.

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
Here is the mq4 file for the indicator.

The lines like the following need to be changed. There are 7 of these groups that look like the following.

if(EUR)

{

double EURUSD_Fast = ma("EURUSD", Fast, MA_Method, Price, i);

double EURUSD_Slow = ma("EURUSD", Slow, MA_Method, Price, i);

if (!EURUSD_Fast || !EURUSD_Slow)

break;

}

I changed mine for IBFX like the following. I added the "m" after the pair.

if(EUR)

{

double EURUSD_Fast = ma("EURUSDm", Fast, MA_Method, Price, i);

double EURUSD_Slow = ma("EURUSDm", Slow, MA_Method, Price, i);

if (!EURUSD_Fast || !EURUSD_Slow)

You need to make it look like what is in your title bar at the top of your chart.

Hi Whatfx,

you will not get alf or any other indicators on this site to work with ig's charting package.you will need to download metatrader4 and use that for all your charting and use ig for dealing.

doc.

p.s. Nice to see some of the original contributors coming back to the thread, was getting a bit fed up with seeing the tumble weed rolling across the screen, hope your all making plenty. Long live Alfred the great!!!

can i ask, does this system repaint?

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
Hi

I didn't have time to trade this morning but here are a couple of possible trades that may have been taken on GU. The chart may look a little different from my other ones as I am still tweaking on an alert and trying different settings. The readings on the right just give me an idea what the different inputs to the alert are doing at any moment in time. When I have time I will set and watch a chart and watch the different readings to see what needs to be changed in the alert to make it better. But from the way the alert is coded I believe where I show the entry is where it would have given an alert with my present settings. The other SL and TP points are after the fact so they could have varied under real conditions. If everything went as showed the profit may have been around +43 pips on the second trade. The first one maybe could have worked out but for a smaller profit, may have been close but profitable.

I will be forward testing the alert on a demo account the rest of the week and see how it goes and see if it needs any more tweaks. Its a slow process.

Good Luck

If anyone has any great ideas to make this perfect please let me know.

I am just trying to cut down on the amount of time needed in front of the computer.

Edit: You will notice I am entering probably just a little late, but I am trying to be safe and avoid some wiplash.

thank you for taking your time and testing this for us.

LouG,

Thank you for this simple system. I have been following this thread for over a week now, however, this is my first post.

My question is: can ALF actually be used in a higher TF? I have a full time job and the lowest TF I can trade now is H4.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
Hi

I have been rather busy this week with the day job so not much evening time to work on the alert I am testing with the last Pilotui template and indicators he posted. If you are interested go to post #921 and download the zip file Pilotui posted there with all the indictors and template he has designed. The alert I am working on will be used with those indicators. As you can see I have modified the template just a little so the different alerts are now shown on the right side of the chart and change color to show you whats happening. I still need to do more testing, but when done I will post the alert indicator. But if you are interested I would suggest you read this entire thread and then try Pilotui's setup to get the hang of what I am trying to do with this alert. I did a test last night and below are the screen shots of what happened with 2 alerts that went off on EURUSD. I also took a screen shot before I left for work this morning so you can see how the trades would have worked out. Sometimes when Windows does a screen capture it must grab when the indicators are being updated, as you can see in the one case the indicator windows are empty. The alert is dsigned to take a screen shot at the same time the alert is given so I can later go back and see just what was on the screen at the time of the alert. I am still tweaking the alert but these 2 look to be winners. The alert is very selective and may miss some that you may have taken in the manual way.

If you have any ideas on this please post them for us all to share.

Edit: I am using the alert on the M15 time frame.

Edit: Also, I did not have the trade time in the alert engaged, so as you can see the first alert happened before my trade window.

Hello Selller,

Very nice. Wonderful work.

Regards,

Jeff

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
Seller , the 2nd trade alf was not below MTF alf, correct me if I am wrong, it still made money , but I thought everything had to be below mtf alf ?

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
Can you be more specific with a picture?

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
I dont know how to draw the lines and stuff, I know that PA was below the both alf's but it was to my undersstanding that everything was suppose to be below the mtf alf, still great work though

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
In other words the blue line was not below the redl line

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
OK, I see what your looking at. With the present indictaor the red line is not coded into the alert. I will do some testing to see if it should be added, what does everyone think? The thing is the calculations are done real time on each tick but I believe the lines are not up to date with the calculations  so may lag untill the candle closes and they are updated. I thought the red line was part of the exit stradegy. I believe the red line is part of the "Instant_Trendline" indicator. The light gray dotted line I thought was the "ALF-MTF", and everything is below it where the arrow is.

I could always add the "ALF-MTF" if it looks like it may help. One day of testing doesn't tell much yet. By the end of next week maybe I will have a better idea as to how it is going to work. Alerts always look good on past history but can falll flat on their face when forward tested.

Good Luck

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
Im a big fan of your work seller I like what you did with THV, Im just trying to understand this system based on the rules, you still made the pips you just got in a little early it seems

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
Hi

I just checked the code for the ALF-MTF and the "Instant_Trendline" indicators. The red and yellow lines are part of the "Instant_TrendLine" indicator, the yellow is the trend and the red is the trigger. The Light Gray dotted line is the "ALF-MTF" indicator. According to Pilotui's rules you would use the red line as a trigger for an exit. I didn't see in his rules where he was using the "ALF-MTF" but in the example trade everything is below the Light Gray dotted line which is the "ALF-MTF".

Thanks for the comments, I am open to any suggestions as to make for a better alert. Will see by the end of next week as to how it runs and maybe can then tweak it some more.

Edit: It seems a lot of the times you get a pull back after an entry, which hopefully doesn't pull back to your Stop Loss and take you out. But what do you do, wait and hope you get a pull back for the next entry or enter on the first setup, kind of a toss up.

Good Luck

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Thanks for the clarification

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
I was just going over the template and do see where the "ALF-MTF" is used, so I will take a look and see if I should re-code the last rule so it uses "ALF-MTF".

I was using cut through ALF instead of cut through ALF-MTF. Will see about changing it.

Thanks for catching that.

Good Luck

Edit: I have changed the last trigger so rather than the Sinal Line(Yellow) cutting through Alf, it has been changed to Signal Line(Yellow) cutting through "ALF-MTF" 30.

Edit: Actually, I think I missed the MTF alert all together, so I just need to add one more alert to mix, rather than change one.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
Thanks for pointing out my error on the alert, sometimes it takes a while to get me pointed in the right direction.

I appreciate the help.

I have added one more trigger to the others so the last one will now be the Yellow trend line  cutting thru the "ALF-MTF".

If anyone else sees something I am missing please let me know so I can correct it.

I will have to wait until next week to test out the new settings.

At the present the old one is running on 4 pairs, will see what it looks like tonight when I get home.

Good Luck

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
Dont mention it, I wish I knew how to program but i dont have the patience, I guess thats why we leave it up to you guys the experts.

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Well it looks like I still didn't state everything correct. After I got home and looked at a real chart I now see what is what and changed the alerts to be correct. Sorry if I got anyone mixed up over what lines were what on the chart. Looks like I was the only one not seeing correctly. So here is what I think they are.

seller9, I have been testing this system and I have some observations. I find that ALF is a great guide for trading but, like any system, you need trading experience to profit from this. It is only a tool not the answer to inexperience. One comment on the signals, so far, I have found any signals attached to this chart as more bothersome than useful. The main reason is that the signals do not take into account the trends (either dominate or intraday). Until there is a signal that can do that, I find signals not very helpful.

I must say that the ALF approach as a whole is most interesting and I have been experimenting with it on demo for a week. I would not go live with it until it proves itself under a variety of conditions. As an added tool in the arsenal it is obvious that it is most useful. I love it on the H1 tf and find it very helpful there. Lower tf's can give far too many signals for my liking. Oddly, it does not seem to be helpful on H4 and above. Personally, I only view lower tf's for exit as I am trading longer trends.

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
Quite busy last week so didn't have much time to work on the alert. I made a few changes this weekend and have it running on EU this week to see what it can do. What looks good in hind site on a chart doesn't always work in real time.

Anyone using the system with consistant positive results?

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
Do you mean "Strength Change"? This is when the Red and Green lines on the bottom indicator reverse. If the Green one is on top you would want to be buying, if the Green line crosses the red and goes below it you would want to be selling.

When I set up the bottom indicator "Strength" I make the "Base" curency the green line and the second currency the red line. That way no matter what pairs I am watching the green line is always the base and the red the other. So if the green crosses up throught he red you would look for a buy and if the green crossed down through the red you would look to sell. Of course your other indicators should agree.

Good Luck

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
I picked up a free indicator from another site (not sure if I can post it here) which I have been using the last few days to pick the strongest currencies against the weakest one, then using this system to trade them. So far, it is working nicely, but it is way too early to say whether this is the best way to stay away from ranging pairs.

If anyone is interested in this indicator send me a PM and I will send a link.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
Here is what it looks like

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
What do the numbers mean ?

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
The higher numbers mean the currency is stronger. If the color is red it is very strong. The lower numbers mean it is weaker. Blue means very weak.

thanks, u gonna post it ?

If you read his post he said to send him a private message and then he will send you the link.

--- 帖子 #1143 ---

Since the link to get it is on a commercial vendor, I am not sure if I am allowed to post it, but I am happy to send it to you

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
I think he does not want to post it....it is a free indicator

If you google henryliuforex. you will find it

I installed it, and it is kinda cool....but it tells me what is happening now....the USD is strong or weak, the EUR is strong or weak...etc....but I could have told you that by looking at a chart.....so I can not think how I will use this in my trading.....to make pips I need to know what is going to happen in the future....the only thing that will tell me that is price action

all the indicators in the world will tell you what has happened in the past

Right now that indicator that he is talking about is saying JPY is very strong and EUR is very weak.....sure enough .....open a chart and the pair is dropping like a stone.....but the move has happened.....missed it

However if I had been watching it previously I might have sold when it broke support

Anyways....cool indicator anyways.

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
Hello,

Agreed it is a cool indicator but it is a non lagging indicator which is better than most indicators which lag.

Also, saves you time from having to open other charts.

Hi Seller,

Thanks for posting your template. I like the look of the PWDB. Unfortunately,

1. I dont fully understand all the displayed detail, can you tell me where I can get more information.?

2. Also, probably something I might find here from pilotui threads. But, I think the Strength indicator is not functioning on my charts. I dont see the strength lines. The tilda's are visible. Do you know why this is.? Is it something to do with indi load order..?

Appreciate. Regards Cenzo

No need to go to commercial sites.

thank you,

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
Hi Sam,

I have tried Henry Lui's currency strength meter. My personal experience may not be overall consensus. When the indicator works, its very good. However, it was very resource intensive and tended to impact pc processing and thus MT responsiveness. I had to run it on a separate laptop.

I would say however, HL is a very good technician and an excellent trading educator, so hats off to him completely

Cenzo

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
I have tested them just for fun. I do not understand why should anyone need these kinds of indicators because the strength of different currencies can be very well estimated without any special tools. If EURUSD has moved up recently then logically EUR is stronger than USD at that moment. Even in some minutes the situation may be changed totally.

Better not to waste time and energy (and CPU) on what has happened in past.

P.S. I posted the indicators only for the reason that I do not like any suggestions to go to commercial sites even if they sometimes provide anything for free. These sites make money on newbie's naiveness but in fact, they sell air to you. If you need any tools for trading Forex, just find them in cyberspace using Google or search in FF or TSD forum.

Thanks Lou G for the great system !

Hi Traders

Sorry I haven't had much time to work on the alert as I promised as I have been spending most of my free time working on a similar one over on the THV thread. It looks like it may have potential so if you want to give that one try just pop over to the THV forum and go to post 19957. If your not familar with the THV forum it is a manual M1 trading method developed by Cobra and others, if you like it you should try and read the entire thread. The thread is quite long but is very good and has a lot of very good info.

Lou G,

Thanks for the detailed information, I appreciate the simplicity message in the trade signals. In the spirit of staying away from indicator overload, is there a way of tracking an indication of the pip-distance from the alf line to measure overbought/oversold = possibly help in exploiting attractive "take profit" opportunities when managing a trade that is running?

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
I am having the same problem. I am using it at M1 and it only alert me for the first arrow. Really hope someone can clarify this.

A million thanks for Lou for posting this thread.

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
this strat doesnt need any other indicators, just an understanding of price action, basic support resistance, pivot points,

If you understand the basics of how price moves on a chart, any chart, you can make pips with this strategy.

for instance:

123 reversals, continuation

pin bars

engulfing paterns

double tops

I have been trading this way but without the ALF, and after some testing it seems to get me in perhaps earlier and makes an excellent stop when in a strong trend move, I will post some charts over the weekend to show you how i trade...

big respect to lou, great example of how basic price action and 1 indicator is perhaps the best of both worlds

A great system...

but it's needs good understanding of price action...

I recently put on the same chart (5m tf) 6 ALFs

they are working like a very good dynamic resistance and with the entry

on the 5m alf, there are some interesting setups together with the

other alfs

we still need daily and weekly pivots+ fibos

I am still trying to get something out of this ...i think there is good potential

try it on your own charts...

then check how the price action reacts with mtf ALFies and pivots...

5m (our entry alf)

15m

30m

60m

240m

Hi Lou,

This is Rick. I am new to this site and don't really know how to send a message to any member. I hope this one works.

I am very interested in finding a good Renko indicator for MT4 (like the one Shabs has). I have downloaded a few of them on the net but the problem is some of them doesn't convert the bars into boxes and nothing actually happens when I drag them to the chart. Why is that?

I could find one that seems to work but is very price sensitive and I don't know how to adjust the pips as it doesn't have any properties.

Is there any good Renko you could suggest?

I really appreciate that.

Rick

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
Here's one that's worked for me, Rick. Be aware that it goes into your experts folder. Drag it onto a 1 minute chart, select your box size, click OK (be sure Expert Advisors are enabled), then go to File>Open Offline and click on the M2 chart that corresponds.

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
Thank you Lou G.

However, as I said before, I am new to this so please bear with me:

1. How do I make the Experts Advisor available?

2. When I saved it to Expert folder, it didn't show up there so I had to put it in indicator folder but when I opened the offline chart, it didn't give any parameter window to adjust the size of the box.

How can I fix this problem?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
Hi Rick. BTW, I'm not LouG. He's one of the advanced beings around here. I'm just one of the lower life forms.

You enable Expert Advisors with the button on your toolbar. I just got a better idea: Go to the Rockenbach System. It's on the first page of Trading Systems right now. He uses Renko and has full instructions in his thread.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
Thank you pinhead. No matter how low you are, you still higher than me

OK, I enabled the expert advisor & followed the instruction and this time it gave me a window to adjust the box size. I was so happy. but when I clicked ok, poof! no chart was generated. Do you know why???

I am getting so frustraded with this.

You also said to check out Rockenbach System. How do I do that?!

Thanks again.

Hello Lou G

I am new to trading and having been looking at various systems in Forexfactory which to me as a beginner seemed quite complicated or had lots of indicators on the chart which look messy, I came across your Alf revisited system with its nice clean charts and I decided that this is what I want to learn.

I have read 15 pages of the thread so far and have started demo trading feeling quite pleased with myself for choosing to learn what appears to be a good simple system.

To help my learning I have also been reading up about candles on a different site to hopefully help me make a success of this forex system.

I then fast forwarded to the last few pages to see what you are saying in your latest posts but was disappointed to find that you haven't posted for quite some time.

Have you given up on this system now? If so do you mind if I ask why, I can see that you are still active on different threads.

Hi guys and Lou G,

A friend of mine coded an ea for trading the alf.Buys when the candle opens above alf , sells when candle opens below alf.If the price goes back to alf it closes the trade.Need your ideas and opinions to improve this system.Maybe someone would add a rule for this.Buy only if the price is above 62 EMA and alf, sell only if the price is below 62 EMA and alf.Any comments or any ea's that has allready been coded ?

Not sure if anyone still visits this thread but Thank you Lou G. I love this strategy with my own little tweak.

Pink line above the blue/ Price close above the ALF

GN Closed out at 75 pips

GJ still running, looking for 65 pips

Finally getting some consistency

Hey Toannq90,

Here you go. I set mine to 25,29,9. You can play around the settings to your liking.

Got in at the pivot line and got out after 20 pips. I should have let it run but I have a love hate relationship with Gold
