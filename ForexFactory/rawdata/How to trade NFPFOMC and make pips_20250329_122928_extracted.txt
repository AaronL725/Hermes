Common question to ponder : How to trade NFP &amp; FOMC High Impact News for USD Generally during NFP &amp; FOMC Events , XXX USD &amp; USD XXX pairs starts trending up/down crazily for huge amount of PIPS depending on NFP(Non Form Payroll) US Employment data (or) for FOMC: Fed Dovish /Hawkish stance on US Economy + QE Taper/More QE (QE1,QE2 &amp; QE3) + USD Rates Increase etc.. To start with there are 3 options at disposal for us : Shut your PC, am not gonna trade and outguess these data ==&gt;(stay away from this high impact news NFP/FOMC ) Use Commercial news trading software like : Oracle Trader NFP Pilot Use a very simple strategy which I have used time and again proven to be successful (read below) Simple Strategy : As a trader we are aware let it be NFP (or) FOMC news , the impact it creates on USD is phenomenal ,So how we do get our share of PIPS by trading it smartly?? I have tried this approach many number of times , as there is not much risk involved and have grabbed decent amount of PIPS every time depending on the nature of move we have based on this news. Before the event, say 7min ago : Take in all 6 trades in SAME Direction /SAME Volume &amp; keep the pending orders 2x times the initial volume at 30 pip distance For Example : Entry : 3pairs from XXX USD Universe : Buy 0.1 EUR USD 1.3411 BUY 0.1 GBP USD 1.6952 BUY 0.1 AUD USD 0.9391 3pairs from USD XXX Universe : BUY 0.1 USD JPY 102.08 BUY 0.1 USD CAD 1.0852 BUY 0.1 USD CHF 0.9117 set 6 pending orders 30pips distance 2x times the above ones i.e : SELL 0.2 EUR USD 1.3381 SELL 0.2 GBP USD 1.6922 SELL 0.2 AUD USD 0.9361 SELL 0.2 USD JPY 101.78 SELL 0.2 USD CAD 1.0822 SELL 0.2 USD CHF 0.9087 Exit : I generally close all the trades at one go after the pending trades for min 3 pairs gets activated out of 6 and have decent $$ profit to take home Why this strategy works and good to make an EA to test out too : NFP/FOMC events generally have a theme to make USD strong /weak, that creates trending opportunities if assume the data created USD positive sentiment: out of our 6 trades USD XXX Universe group (3 pairs) will do well and we have to worry about the XXX USD Universe . Pending sell orders for XXX USD pairs Universe will get activated to limit any damage and make profits on downside + plus we have 3 USD XXX pairs doing well + voila we have limited damage on XXX USD pairs there you go we make some amount of profits depending on the move. To automate this strategy for EA Coders, here's my thoughts : i) EA should place both BUY 6 pairs( 3 USD XXX &amp; 3 XXX USD pairs) along with SELL 6 pairs ( 3 USD XXX &amp; 3 XXX USD pairs) at the same time/volume "x" if no orders of those pairs exist ii) pending orders for all open trades with 2x volumes awaiting at 30pips distance iii) Basket order mechanism to poll all the open orders total profit matching the user set ProfitTarget Dollars and close them at one go. I have used this mechanism over many Fed FOMC &amp; NFP events and proven to be successful doing it manual, any comments/tweakings welcome. Cheers, Scoobi

Good pips harvested on US GDP move today with same strategy, US GDP 4% actual Vs 3% expected. USD moved up Vs Rest of the pairs and made 44pips nett closed all and waiting for FOMC . cheers

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Why not only use pending orders intead of hedge positions? What broker for strategy ? What about slippage?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks Scoobi, Ill will give it a whirl. Very neat and simple also the outline is direct and clear.. i will trade the fomc in 1 hour and report back Just to clarify; 7 min before event enter trade xx lots for 6 pairs and place orders as above

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Good point. I would use best possible broker, such as pepperstone , there are a few with very low spreads i can post others if you want About the recent event NFP today, scoobi you said you were long EURUSD at 1.3411 so it went south and then your in a short at 1.3381, doing the calcs you wouldnt have been in a positive number for that pair, i imagine others performed better so overall you were up and at that point you close them all

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Scoobi where are you.. 80 traders viewing!! just want some clarity before entering on fomc, thanks

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Verve, Please let me know what doubts you have? Thanks, Scoobi

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Interesting idea.... will give it a whirl... thanks for sharing...

--- 帖子 #9 ---
thanks!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Do u enter all 6 pairs 7 min before news and place orders, silly question but just want to confirm this.. then i exit ?? see pic and pls let me know, thank you Edit: Changed image, i placed 3 buys and 3 sells, was supposed to be 6 buys, and 6 sell orders

--- 帖子 #11 ---
did it work?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Break even basically, winning with audusd so up a few pips overall... ill await scoobi to place some posts and images

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Verve you are right, however you kept 3x times sell orders which is more adventurous not required

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Is there a chatroom inside ForexFactory to facilitate us chat?, I can explain in detail.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Earlier in the day GDP data Outsmarted the expectations 4% US GDP Vs 3% and USD Emerged Stronger to make us pips through USD XXX pairs! For FOMC Fed issued the following statement which assured to tapper 10billion usd however raised few growth concerns &amp; US Federal Reserve cuts QE purchases as expected and lackluster statement leaves Dollar mostly unchanged, yields pulling back modestly. This made players to book profits in USD XXX pairs long and XXX USD pairs, creating fall in UJ,UCAD,UCHF and raise in EU,GU,AU temporarily made total +ve pips with UJ and UCAD hedged for me.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Guys who are risk averse, please keep pending orders at 25pips instead of 30pips. Keeping it further closer will whipsaw both sides which is unwarranted.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Attached File(s) trailstop.mq4 9 KB | 1,174 downloads Folks attached the above position management EA , it won't trade its just for convenient open order closure usage. Please attach the EA to any chart, when you have placed the initial 6 orders and pending orders. Based on your risk appetite and market sense set desired profit target using the following parameter as inputs : extern int ProfitTarget=10; // ==&gt; implies 10usd target If you give input as 10 USD, then all the open positions including hedged orders + pending orders will be closed upon your account profit reaching 10 usd. Hope it helps. Regards, Scoobi

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Got ya, 3x is not correct. FF does not have a chat feature. We communicate with sign language Lets see how the next event occurs, the fomc was dull. Im not completely clear on exit strategy. So i was in a market buy for all 6 pairs, USDCAD neared sell order but by this point i closed all trades. Ill see your posts and images in the future. this is not exactly going to be a rambunctious thread with so few events, which is fine by me, ill use this strategy in my retirement

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I think, the result depends very much on what pairs go to your direction and what pairs go against. We have to remember that the volatility and pip value of different pairs is different.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Verve closing all the trades is left to once appetite for certain profit , you closed it since you made net +ve pips with upmove in AU,GU,EU with UJ/UCAD and UCHF dragging. I will start capturing screenshots of trades from next NFP or FOMC with clear entry and exits I did. Other traders also can post the same. This FOMC Statement was more lame didn't create much trend, some times if you see data mentioned as "FOMC Conference/Minutes" in FF Calender Fed Chair Yellen has live questionnaire session that gets interesting and moves market a lot however this was just plain text statement for us to read and make out what we like

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Agreed Indrek. We have NFP stacked up on this Friday : 8:30am GMT USD Non-Farm Employment Change 230K 288K Lets get it rolling

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Enormously grateful for this contribution to the trader community, I managed to make some good pips, 1000 thank you Scoobidooi!!! Strategy really Helpful

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Good Wallstoro. we have friday NFP to make some too. Would you mind posting your entries/exits for nfp , appreciate it!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Scoobi, What if the pendings are triggered within the 7 mins before the news released ? Also, do you have a "plan" for a SL limiting the losses in case things went bad ?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
It doesn't happen most of the time Ferrufx, however we can't rule'em out. Hence to protect account at all cost we can use trailstop EA I posted to set SL on all open trades with following setting : Leave ProfitTarget=0 tentatively and enable 30pips SL for all open positions and trail the same, once you see some profits on all the open nett positions we can go &amp; set ProfitTarget=10 (10USD profit example) it will close all orders for us.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Fine. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I'm interested in trying this strategy out tomorrow but I have a concern. Considering that a) I am a beginning trader and b) I trade on my phone while I'm at my job... trying to manage 6 positions at one time during the NFP seems like a recipe for disaster. What are your thoughts on only trading two pairs, say EUR/USD &amp; USD/CHF. Is that any more or less risky?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Nico, Doing it on EU and UCHF is as good too, same applies to AU and UCAD. These are opposite repulsive pairs. EU/UCHF and AU/UCAD pairs share negative correlation most of the time since NFP or FOMC is USD Centric you can still get pips but its leading to a thought its more safe than 6 pairs. if you trade say 4 pairs EU,UCHF,AU,UCAD with initial lot 0.1 , please make sure you keep pending sells with 0.2 lot at say 25pips distance for all the 4 pairs and if you feel market is trending instead of zigzag ranging wait a bit and take profit of all open orders (or) close if you get decent pips. Cheers, Scoobi

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Gotcha. Thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thanks Scoobi - you have answered part of my query. I am thinking of using the strategy on my Ninja Trader Platform using the E - mini FUTURES but I guess the combination of those 4 currencies wont compute to your plan?? I have eu / swissy/aussie/cad but they are all in relation to the USD. In other words - futures will be no good because there is no negative correlation as you describe. The other point that is unclear is if you are entered say LONG, how long do you leave the short pendings open? Or do you cancel the shorts as soon as your longs are initiated? Any suggestions to a new boy on the block?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hallo Scoobi, I'm a newbie, just learned about trading in forex almost 3 week ago. learned demo in 2 days, started with real money after that. lost more than 1k usd as of today. Managed to withdraw 50 usd. I made a lot of stupid mistake.huhu.. I am very eager to use your method . I have a few question that i wish to clarify with you .. why only 0.1 to start with ? - i mean why dont start with 1.0 , do u have any idea how much capital required to sustain like buy 1.0 for start and sell for 2.0 ? how about the FOMC post , the chart dont even broke 30 pips ..when to close ? i hope you get what i'm trying to ask here , apologize as i'm a very new and really do not know what is the trading term that should be applied in my question ..

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I would suggest you to gain experience before starting right away trading "heavy" news events. News trading isn't for everybody ... even experienced traders.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I don´t mind at all, for sure I will Sccoobidoobi, i´ll try to do it on friday otherwise by the next NFP/FOMC released. regards.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Scoobidoobi, If using account size of $10k, what lot size to use for the initial orders? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I think that the best way to trade this is to open both buy and sell positions respectively one hour or thirty minutes to the time of the news. it is a must that the market must take a position up to about 30 pips or more. if sell position is gaining up to 30 pips put trailling stop loss at 20 pips, allow the profit to run. if it happens that by the time the news is released and the sell position is lossing, it will stop at 20pips while the buy position's loss of 30 pip will be reduced by 10 making it -20 now. at this point, the market can either go ahead to eliminate the other loss or increase your winning sell position. IS THERE ANY OBJECTION TO THIS. if it is logical to you, lets make ea, on this regard. thank you.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi, what is 3x time mean? Happy piping Regards

--- 帖子 #37 ---
3 times the original lot size (ie. 0.10 x 3 = 0.30)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Many thanks FerruFx.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Waste of time, try explaining more and also contribute to the ideas of this thread

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I dont know if i did this right.. seems like a mess, thankfully just demo for now Scoobi what you think I know i did treble trade size again So this is whipshaw, now that all positions are cleared they can get on with weakening the USD

--- 帖子 #41 ---
You would have less losses by respecting the money management suggested by the thread starter.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
You have messed up mate with higher pending lots!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Well, this hasn't gone very well. Bought .2 lots EUR/USD at 1.3392 Bought .2 lots USD/CHF at 0.9084 Opened pending sell for .4 lots at 1.3367 &amp; 0.9059 respectively The NFP triggered my short instantly and then price shot back up. It's been trying to get back down but not looking promising so far.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I think there was too much noise in the market to allow this to play out properly...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
This strategy worked, nice one scoobi, its a shame so few events to trade

--- 帖子 #46 ---
This is very interesting strategy Scooobi. I have a question; Do you think that we can use this strategy when there are other announcements which affect different pairs. For instance, last evening we had AUD PPI q/q at 21:30 and then the GBP Manufacturing PMI at 4:30am today.? Your thoughts would be appreciated

--- 帖子 #47 ---
This system shows promise, entered the news yesterday and made 10pips. Today managed to grab 40pips, though i was using 0.1 for buys and 0.3 for sell stops on Tradefort. Nice work Scooobi.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Despite a tough start I stuck it out and was able to recover for +20 pips. This news trading is not for the faint of heart

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Does anyone know why you would use only 6 of the majors instead of all 7?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Which way did you go on the NFP? i.e.... did you start with a buy or sell?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Scoobidoobi, Thank you for sharing that strategy regard NFP and FOMC; very kind of you. I am looking forward to using it. I will test it this weekend on the Australian Dollar and the British Pound. My previous strategy was to take my best guess on which way it would go---I don't wish to discuss the success rate (lack thereof) of that strategy. Thank you for sharing a more professional / scienticific strategy.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi Scoobidoobi . I liked the strategy you have for AAA news, but I would like to ask you about the stop in orders of 0.1 and 0.3. I do not work with MT4 and Not speak English but that's no problem. Thanks

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I blindly entered Buys as market orders and then sell stops 30pips away. I think deciding on direction would help in the long run.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks fellas, this 6 pairs make a good combo. Today netted 45pips . Main contribution from UJ Sell, GU and EU Buy

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Let Mr Market decide where it wants to go, our objective is to book profits as simple as that : To avail profits do the following : Have 2 Accounts : Account 1: Take all 6 buys 0.1 lot and keep sell pending orders at 30pips distance 0.2 lots as discussed Account 2 : Take all 6 sells 0.1 lot and keep buy pending orders at 30pips distance 0.2 lots as discussed you can make double pips this way , use the trailstop EA I have posted earlier by setting ProfitTarget parameter on the both accounts (assuming its MT4 based) and book $$ Cheers Have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi. Somebody speak spanish? I need help.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Yes absolutely. You got the trick now. Lets say you have major GBP Data : Pick 3 pairs from GBP XXX Universe and Pick 3 pairs from XXX GBP Universe, either use single account approach (or) 2 accounts approach for double pips which I wrote a while ago Let me tell my experience last week on NZD data where NZD fell nearly 120pips : my NZD XXX pairs long where hedged safely at 30pips by sells and then longs XXX NZD (like EUR NZD, AUD NZD, GBP NZD) all made tremendous pips netted about 118pips in all I am very glad you found out the logic that I use, its not just for FOMC/NFP haha. Godbless!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
If the logic works then it has to work always not only with news. Just at ordinary times PA is slow and you have to wait longer, right?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Agreed, normal times after US Market close and asian hours PA is damn slow.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
During Asian hours market most often does not turn. And if including Yen pairs, there are good chances to make money. I personally prefer to sleep at these hours But we could try your system right before London open or before NY open. Not necessarily before any big news.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Because it's a hedging strategy. The volume you have longing the USD has to equal the volume shorting the USD (as far as the initial buys go). An odd number of trades keeps it from being a hedge.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
lol

--- 帖子 #63 ---
scobidodo,am a newbis here,can u please explain this strategy in my level,do you mean the 6pairs buy will be placed 7min to the news irespective of where the market is going? can you please explain step by step thanks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thanks Nico for explanation. FOMC and NFP are major news for USD likewise we have other major events for EUR,GBP,AUD,CAD and NZD to trade also. The idea to take 6 longs (3 USD XXX pairs + 3 XXX USD pairs) 7minutes before the news is to have the underline news currency USD in an indirect hedged equilibrium, so that we are not much affected if the news move USD up or down. Also we have pending sell orders to take care of the wrong orders by locking them.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Why do you need 6 pending orders when it would much easier/simpler to have only 2 orders? During NFP, if it is positive then USD will go up. Hence only need to set EUR/USD buy and USD/JPY buy orders at 30pips. Why do you need to have orders for GBP/USD, AUD/USD when they generally go in the same direction as the EUR? Is it to increase profit? If yes, then you just need to increase the lot size for both orders.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Please read the initial post with clear step by step, its pretty simple and straightforward. Our experts Verve, Nico , dobenjis or magft one of us can also help and illustrate if needed. Being a beginner please try thoroughly for bunch of news releases on a demo account and then once u get confidence try doing on live with micro lots before entering main stream. Good Luck!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
High Impact News : USD 3 pairs from USD XXX Basket (UJ, UCHF and UCAD) long implies 3 lots of USD long vs CHF/JPY/CAD 3 pairs from XXX USD Basket ( EU,GU and AU) long implies 3 lots of XXX long vs USD A=B,B=C implies A=C , nett 3 lots of USD long = 3 lots of USD short as above going into the news, this combo makes good pips when USD Index gets clear direction for short term where it wants to head. Like today we had bad NFP + Unemployment Rate USD Index dropped from 81.58 to 81.33 . Likewise you can use the same mechanism for other high impact news for a different Major pair too. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Honestly, I think it's just personal preference. You can trade exactly as the strategy says, 6 X .1 lot buy orders or you can do 2 X .3 buy orders and achieve pretty much the same results. Although I would be more inclined to use EUR/USD &amp; USD/CHF as it's a more pure hedge and easier to manage, but that's just my preference.

Hi Scoobi News announcement 12.30AM for me but enjoyed getting up to play . Few teething issues but can see good possibilities - just follow your rules. Issues were - My pending sells were set for 0.10 instead of 0.20. My cock-up -hurried a bit too quick thinking 7 mins before announcement may not be enough time but it is plenty of time to set this up. The USxxx shorts did not trigger - found that FXCM don't allow hedging. To fix the problem I had to close the original buys on these pairs ( automatic loss of course) then sell at market as price banged my original 30pip placements. At this point I cancelled the the Pending sells on the xxxUS pairs which were now in the right &amp; profitable direction. I will use my other provider to test this in the future - at least hedging is permitted by them. Being new &amp; exciting and also needing to get back to sleep I let the strategy run until market close just to observe motion of the pairs and look at correlation. At one point where I was in front of the screen very early on, there was a positive growth of 30 - 40 pips and looking at the candle wicks for that time period I am guessing that this figure may have been higher. If you could snag +50 regularly this will be a winner IMHO. My final result at Market close is Negative 50 pips but if you were actively watching progress you would never let that happen. Just for interest I have noted the maximum pips at the spike times and this shows the following - EU + 50 GU + 36 AU + 53 CHF +15 JPY +38 CAD + 16 Does this tell me that USDxxx not as adversely affected as the Euro , Pound &amp; Aussie ?? Looking forward to trying this on other News events as well . Well done Scoobi Pictures attached show my set up with couple of minutes to go and then what the charts were like at market close . Any comments or suggestions most welcome. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Scoobi - have found the attached extract from Investopedia . In your experience what would be the major movers we should test out.?? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks Nico and Binnie! @Binnie, Please feel free to try on any high impact news for a major pair barring CHF news which is sort of subdued.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Got it, Thanks for that Nico1359...

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi Binnie, Forex Factory gives you all these and you can set filters for different colour flags (Red, Amber ..etc) I have found it to be very accurate and timed precisely. If you already know this just ignore my comments.. good luck...... "Scoobi for president"

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I think we should call this "The Scoobi Method" because it Scooooops Pips.. Have a great weekend all and lets hear about great successes next week.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
cheers DOBE, Yep I use the FF News Calendar - wouldn't leave home without it.... . Just there is so much news these days , I got little idea which ones cause enough ripple in the market to play this strategy. Time will tell eh.. BTW - you sure you and Scoobi don't know each other??? ( Scoobi Do !!!! ) Have a good weekend. edit - or should that read SCOOBIDOOBIE DOO !!!! Also - does anyone have an idea on how this strategy could ever be back-tested? I have been thinking about it all day but because of the market action being around 6 pairs concurrently , i don't think a replay is possible ??? OR IS THERE ????

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Aussie Retail Sales News Progress. Not much happening really. Initial moves soon drifted. Once direction established I closed the 2 losing Longs on the xxxAUD's and cancelled the pending sells on the AUDxxx's. Drifting still - will leabve it going till London Open to see if extra volumes make a difference. Otherwise - will go again tomorrow on Trade Balance figures. 1st chart just shows set up. ( Note Longs at 0.2 / shorts at 0.40 ) 2nd chart shows progress after 90mins. Any ideas on the pairs - I don't have any other xxxAUD's on my platform?? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Aussie Retail though High Impact Data, hardly any moves I didn't trade that Binnie. In xxxAUD, you might have EUR AUD , GBP AUD but there are plenty in AUDxxx : AUD USD , AUD JPY, AUD CHF, AUD CAD, AUD NZD

--- 帖子 #78 ---
It is easiest thing to do manually. Just go back to necessary news events, write down the prices before and after the news, and then it is easy to calculate what would happen.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
http://www.newsimpact.com/ this site might help alittle, not sure, but possibly worth a look

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hey thanks Carlsberg, this site looks really interesting...

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi Binnie, all FXCM entities worldwide allow hedging except for FXCM US due to regulations prohibiting hedging in America. Your forum profile mentions that you live in New Zealand which means you can open a hedging-enabled account with FXCM AU which is regulated by ASIC.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
so what you actualy mean is that the same strategy can be used for other NEWS event,the most iportant thing is to follow the rules

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi Scoobi, Im new in the trading world.. can you explain clear what you mean by the Pending order?? is it a (sell/Buy) Limit order or (Sell/Buy) Stop order.. thanks

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Use Stop pending orders Scooobi, you gave recommendations for USD news, do you have any for EUR pairs? The reason i ask is most brokers dont have 3 xxxEUR but lots of EURxxx. In this case would you enter them in reverse? Would you always use 30pips gap or maybe use a factor of ADR? For example: 0.1 BUY EURJPY 0.1 BUY EURAUD 0.1 BUY EURCAD 0.1 SELL EURNZD 0.1 SELL EURGBP 0.1 SELL EURCHF 30pips away: 0.2 SELL STOP EURJPY 0.2 SELL STOP EURAUD 0.2 SELL STOP EURCAD 0.2 BUY STOP EURNZD 0.2 BUY STOP EURGBP 0.2 BUY STOP EURCHF Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Scoobi, Thank you very much for sharing this idea. I used it today on the USD. So far I am still in the USD/CAD, making good $$, something which NEVER would have happened if you hadn't been so unselfish and shared your strategy. Thank you again. I will use this strategy the rest of my trading career. I will definitely use it tonight at 9:30pm (USA time) on the NZD. Scoobi, if you ever come to America, I owe you a round of golf at a very nice golf course...

--- 帖子 #86 ---
If you don't know what is a pending order, you shouldn't even read this thread. The very first thing you should do is to learn the basics. I would highly suggest you to take a look here : http://www.babypips.com

--- 帖子 #87 ---
haha Jim, thanks for the kind words. we can meet some where in vegas/macau u never know catching up on a drink Btw guys today we can make good pips on NZD Data coming shortly ( 2 High Impact data on the way), before that itself PA suggests NZD wants to drop hard. Lets not speculate or predict the data ahead, our strategy for NZD would be using the below pairs for today : NZD USD NZD JPY NZD CAD EUR NZD AUD NZD GBP NZD Personally am planning to do 6 buys of the above pairs with sell orders (2x lotsize) stacked below 25pips apart on Account 1 and on other account 6 sells of the above pairs with buy orders (2x lot size) stacked above 25pips apart on Account 2 Going by current PA, it suggests BIG MOVE on the way lets get GREEN Pips, lets not deviate from the strategy rather make the optimum use of it! May all get GREEN PIPS God Bless! -Scoobi

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Mike, You wont find XXX EUR in your platform don't worry I can think of XAU EUR (Gold Vs Euro) available on my platform. Lets not use that. Incase of EUR Data: ( this will maintain the equilibrium 0.3 lots nett long EUR= 0.3 lots nett short EUR going into "High Impact" Data) 0.1 BUY EUR USD 0.1 BUY EUR JPY 0.1 BUY EUR CAD 0.1 SELL EUR NZD 0.1 SELL EUR AUD 0.1 SELL EUR GBP with appropriate sell stops and buy stops placed would do the job as you mentioned. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
hi, What about spread, slippage, requotes for this strategy ?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
One big lose destroy whole system

--- 帖子 #91 ---
If you have an ecn a/c, spreads should be decent. ofcourse slippage will be there if you start placing market and pending orders at news time , thats why we stay ahead by placing 7min prior.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Naokia, we have 2x times pending orders placed in the opposite direction for all the open orders to protect.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
hello Nico, How u doing today, we have two heavy weight NZD data lined up today. geared up for trading it?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Better to keep in mind that on most brokers pairs have different pip value, and especially big difference is with EURGBP.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I recently traded news for last 3 years.. This settings dont give you edge when pairs like cad, gbp, nzd going crazy(whipsaw). Take example..Check ecb statement before speech on may... Liquid pairs like eur/usd first react smalll drop (20 pip)--&gt; shooted up 60 pip not yet!-0-&gt; then shooted down 80 pip on 1 tick !!! If add negative bias like slippage,, max spreads; this sounds like nightmare from hell

--- 帖子 #96 ---
FerruFX, Thanks for your advice. Been learning the Babypips since i start trade 1 years ago, sorry of if my english is no up to your standard. Rgds

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Scoobi, Thanks for the trade idea.. I had try the trade twice, both set as profit of USD50 to close. the 1st trade is a success, but the 2nd trade is success also but the profit is over USD50 ( about USD133), as i increase the LOT size, however after the trade closed, theres a 3 pending trade still not auto closed. Attached are the screen shot, kindly advice. Thanks once again.

Magft, Thanks you.

I completely understand 100% how this strategy works IN THEORY However, In Actuality; Wouldn't the Pending Orders get filled at a ridiculous price? The entire strategy (I've analyzed it in extreme detail) is hinged upon the Pending Orders producing a profit, whilst the Main Opened Positions are hedged against one another. Assuming a Pending Order is placed at 30 pips distance away and the NFP/news event produces an instant 50 pip move, there is no way the Pending Order would get filled at 30 pips away, it would get filled at 50 pips away. Worst case scenario the move would retrace and now you would have a double-weighted negative position. For example, considering XXXUSD using EURUSD Open Buy 1 Lot @ 1.3010 Pending Sell 2Lot @ 1.2080 30 pips away, placed 5-10 mins before event. NFP opens at 8:30:00am EST and drops 50 pips instantly to 1.2060 hitting Pending Orders, then retraces as news events almost ALWAYS DO after initial move, hence why news events are commonly faded, assume retracement rally of 30 pips to 1.2090 Main Open Position (Original Buy) is -20 pips Pending Sell @ 1.2080 gets filled at 1.2060 and is now -30 x 2 = -60 pips after retracement rally Even with a Stop Loss of 5 pips on Pending Sell, this would mean a loss of -10 pips on Pending Position, 20 pip loss on Main Position and 20 pip gain on Opposite Corresponding USDXXX pair i.e. USDJPY The ENTIRE STRATEGY is based upon the FILL PRICE OF THE PENDING ORDER THAT GETS ACTIVATED How does this strategy work??? Can you explain using the fill price of Pending Orders. Don't worry about the hedging of the main XXXUSD/USDXXX positions that part makes complete sense, the entire strategy is hinged upon the Pending Order that actually gets activated. If you choose to use Slippage Control on Pending Orders, than this gets transformed into the exact same strategy as using Bracket or OCO orders where a Buy and Sell can both be placed 30 pips away and 1 will get activated and the other cancelled, except this Bracket Pending Order strategy is MUCH MORE EFFICIENT and SIMPLE because it uses less open positions and therefore you can use larger amounts and much, much simpler structure and execution. Again, the only issue with this strategy is the fill price. With your strategy you are attempting to trade the INITIAL ACTIONARY MOVE as opposed to FADING THE RE-ACTIONARY MOVE. Can you please clarify how this works speaking only on Actual Fill Price of Pending Order. That is the only caveat of this strategy and is why the people that actually posted their entries have had non-optimal results. I'm surprised that you Scoobie have not posted a single chart of your entries thus far in 5 pages. To be honest I really don't think you strategy works because you can't get filled at 30 pips away if a huge 50-60 pip move occurs instantly. I also believe that is why you not only did not post your results, but have also asked others to post their entries instead. I hope I am incorrect in this characterization, please prove me wrong. I would sincerely love to know how you have combated the Actual Fill Price issue .

Thanks Ronnie for taking time to analyze. To be fair enough if you are on top notch ECN broker whom you trust, filling up the pending order would be the last thing to worry if you are on standard account instead of STP/ECN account it ofcourse becomes an issue. You can try to keep the pending orders bit close if you worry on that filling aspect per say 25pips and give it a go!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Good job elleell , keep practicing in demo till you get comfortable. There are some high impact news which really moves big and we get our share of profits $$ , some times it won't move much or whipsaw a bit. You should be ready to face different market conditions and smart enough to act upon understanding the PA!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Some pending orders didnt close as in your screenshot using the trailstop EA which I have posted, owing to fast markets may be . Please delete them manually if you see some pending orders remain after setting ProfitTarget parameter in trailstop EA and all trades closed by EA. Don't just like that increase lotsizes , stick to money management to arrive at lot calculation take further courses as FerruFx recommended in www.babypips.com , don't be in hurry to trade quickly!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
He is right about the price filling. In case of an huge gap at the news time, the pending will be filled at the tick available price which might be far from the theorical pending price. No broker will guarantee the original pending price.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
can you suggest the pairs to trade for the AUD as my broker only offers one xxAUD can you list the pairs to buy and the pairs to place on sell stop orders thanks

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I understand the strategy perfectly, I will try it out some time on a demo account. I hope you don't think I was attacking you in anyway, I was merely trying to determine the practicality of this strategy because I do see its merits. I do have an ECN broker with one of the largest inter-bank liquidity pools in the world. With regards to NFP's I usually fade the initial move and net between 10-30 pips as it reverts to normal, once it starts backtracking I close the position. I do this very quickly. I will try out your strategy on a demo account, I would appreciate if anyone else that uses this can talk about how/if their Pending Orders are being filled and at what distance. Thanks, ______ RONNIE

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Scoobi.... Can u recommend a good ECN broker? from your experience... would be a good advice for many of us here. Thank you...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
VinFx, LMAX FSA Regulated Alpari Pro Pepperstone Razor ECN/Axitrader Exness ECN and others can add some good ecn brokers too

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Ronnie, if your platform has USDIndex symbol chart, there is better way to do this if you are concerned on filling the pending order position. P.M Me for more. cheers Scoobi

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi comm, Im not totally convinced about this strategy its in trial phase so dont be betting big with the news in a few hours. Im sure scoobi would be best to answer your question, but i will give my opinion; audcad, audusd, euraud, gbpaud, Other pairs: audchf, audnzd, audsgd - however as the setup goes you need three pairs with AUD as base currency and three pairs with AUD as terms currency, this however is not available as most pairs provided by brokers are AUD as base currency. So perhaps try this strategy with these 4 pairs: audcad, audusd, euraud, gbpaud, 1 - Go Long on all pairs - 7 min before news 2 - Place sell orders 30 pips away for all pairs 3 - not sure about the rest, see post 1

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Elleell, Thanks for the post &amp; screen of the trades. Something is confusing me here - I see Positive pips on all of the Buys &amp; Sells on all cross pairs. BUT - where are the Negative Pips on the the original 3 Longs taken 7 mins before News - IE the Pound /Kiwi &amp; Euro. Have you set pending orders to go long above Market prices ?? Cannot work out what you have done. Thanks for the explanation.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thank you Sifu !!

Aussie Unemployment REDNEWS 7 Aug Only 4 pairs on the Aussie so played as a hedge. All Buys &amp; Sells were pending Stops at 25 pips above pre - market ( give or take ). Sells were at 0.2 and buys at 0.1 per rules. Once triggers made - quickly cancelled remaining open orders and let the trades run until my mental profit target was hit $100+. Closed all - took 1min 10 secs to complete. I see market still heading in right direction - another 90 odd pips between the 4 pairs. Still $115 in 1min is pretty damn good eh ? Back to the USA Unemployment tonite so will revert to Scoobi's 6 pair rules. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dear Binnie, I also not sure wat i had done, Im still a kindergarden in trade..I try to look for it.. mean while.. here's my latest trade these morning on AUD. I trade 6 pair AUD against others currency..the result as follow.

Awesome Binnie and ellell , nice green pips for AUD disappointed data. keep going today we have GBP High Impact +EUR ECB Rates + USD Unemployment claims lets follow rules pips will follow great if there is a significant move!

Orders in, does this look right scoobi Update: no spike, so we should close/ exit all?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Scoobi, This morning (8/7/14) @8:30am (USA time), I used your wonderful strategy on the USD (I probably should have chosen the CAD). Anyway, I used the currency pairs USD/JPY and AUD/USD. Imagine my horror when both went negative. I couldn't believe it. Thankfully, neither pair had a large spike, but both pairs were negative for a good 15-20 minutes. The trade started out like it should have, with one pair going short (AUD/USD) and the other going long (USD/JPY). I was like, "Scoobi is a genius." And then, maybe 5 minutes in, USD/JPY went negative, which would have been no big deal if the AUD/USD had also turned around, but it didn't. I couldn't believe it, I had two (2) currency pairs going against me (I did a BUY Market for both pairs). Eventually, maybe 20 minutes later, USD/JPY finally turned around and I made 20+ pips, but that was amazing / scary, to have two USD currency pairs with different bases both going negative and staying there. FOREX is out to get me, I just know it... Thanks for letting me vent. Do you have any idea what could have made both currency pairs go negative? I'm still a believer in your excellent strategy and I'm looking forward to using it tonight on the AUD. Take care, Jimtrade

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thanks Scoobi... will check it out...

--- 帖子 #119 ---
AUD Data u missed a golden chance to make good pips, I mentioned to use 3 AUD XXX Pairs and XXX AUD Pairs ( so that underline currency "AUD" in this case with high impact news is hedged internally plus we have sell stops to protect the wrong ones). Today AUD data it made about 52pips nett, with disappointing AUD Data. Coming to 8:30AM USD Unemployment data, don't pick and leave those pairs at your will use them as a group. I keep hearing from folks some pairs are not there in MT4 Marketwatch, please right click and choose show all option! Note : Use it only low spread ECN Broker, don't use on a dealing desk broker with EUR NZD Spread 9pips ! For USD High Impact data, 6 pairs to use are as follows : 1) EUR USD 2) GBP USD 3) AUD USD 4) USD JPY 5) USD CAD 6) USD CHF Likewise create a template to choose pairs for each high impact data for major currency, incase you don't have 6 pairs use 4 pairs don't ever use just 2 pairs like Jim did. Some one can post list of pairs to trade for other Majors High Impact data, Any Volunteers welcome! -Scoobi

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Perfect Verve!, you nailed it. We place the initial and pending orders 7min ahead right before the NEWS, give about total of 27min (including the start 7min) to see any spike in the pairs if not close it. If you see spike , wait for atleast 3 pending orders (sell orders) to trigger in and lock the wrong ones then after a while when you see green pips use the trailsltop EA setting ProfitTarget value of your choice to close down all the orders if just incase any pending orders are left out please close them manually.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thank you Scoobi---lesson learned.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Scoobi, Thanks to you I kicked butt this morning with GBP/CAD. You know what they say; "Give me a fish, I eat for a day, Teach me to fish, I eat for a lifetime." Scoobi, you've taught us how to fish. You the man!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
. Thx Jim how did u do cad data

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I am intested..Which broker allow you trade this big spikes?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hey Scoobi, I use TradeStation

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I'm sorry Scoobi, I think I misread your question. Per your advice, I used 4 pairs: GPB/CAD, CAD/JPY EUR/CAD, CADCHF

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi Scoobi - any suggestions on the GBP news later tonite ( NZ Time )? I don't have many xxxGBP pairs available to use our normal rules but will try a straight hedge between EG &amp; GU - 25pips either side in case of a spike . I don't know much about the pound news so will be interesting to watch. US Retail Sales also tomorrow so that may be the better bet.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Scoobi, This morning I traded GBP/CAD and EUR/GBP. I did OK on EUR/GBP, but GBP/CAD blew right threw my stop. I set my stop at 50 pips for a little extra cushion against the initial whipsaw up and down action. GBP/CAD gapped OVER my stop/loss and I loss over 150 pips on a 50 pip stop loss. I called Trade Station and they basically said "them's the breaks." Even though my stop loss was triggered at 50 pips, due to the gap the stop loss wasn't executed until further down the chain. Is there any protection against gaps that go against you like that?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Are you following the rules at page 1 of the threads, I have doubts about that. if you have 2x times sell stops set at 20pips apart you wont be running into this issues. you probably kept stoploss and no pending orders to protect for the trades which go against you. I haven't played around with Tradestation platform and mine explored on MT4/MT5 predominantly .

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Binnie, GBP Data yday moved the major and its cross pairs very nicely trending for several hours, as I write this reply GU is still trending at the lowest point of the day . USD Retail sales was negative and that spiked eur usd, aud usd etc. up with uj/uchf down for shortly good pips there too cheers!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Today we have double whammy in for EUR Data in about few hours from now French GDP and German GDP , being Thursday offers more opportunities for better moves on EUR XXX pairs will let us make good pips, dont miss it folks! cheers -Scoobi

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Thank you for your quick response Scoobi. No, apparently I am not following the rules on page 1 of the thread. You're right, I only use, my only protection is a stop loss / sell stop. That's all that Tradestation offers. By the way, it happened again this morning with AUD/USD. trade started to reverse and then Bam!, trade blew right thru my stoploss and I loss $180 (terrible). I called Tradestation and they said there was nothing that they could do, that the volume at that moment was huge and gapped right over my stop loss. I will gladly switch trading platforms. Is MT4/MT5 available in America? What are 2x times sell stops? How do you set them up? What are pending orders? You are correct---I have no pending orders to protect for the trades that go against me. I will go to www.babypips.com like you advised the other reader/trader a few weeks ago. I never understood your directions / rules: "...&amp; keep the pending orders 2x times the initial volume at 30 pip distance." I just buy the pairs and set my stoploss at 50 pips. What do you mean "BUY 0.1 EUR/USD" @1.3411 and "SELL 0.2 EUR/USD @ 1.3381"? I just buy and sell on Tradestation. Thanks Scoobi

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Elleell, FerruFX, Binnie, Verve, and Scoobi, What trading platform do you guys use? I use Tradestation, but the stop loss is NOT protecting me from "gaps." This morning on AUDUSD I had my stop set at .93182, which should have given me a small profit of $5-$7 dollars. The trade reversed and my stop loss was triggered, but it didn't stop until .92986. I lost $180+ when I should have made $7. I called Tradestation and they said the huge surge of sell orders 'gapped' my stop loss. How would pending orders protect me against a gap? Thank you for all of your previous help and advice

--- 帖子 #134 ---
GBP coming---great fear and trepidation because I know it's going to gap and cost me $$$ How do you guys define "Hedging"? I thought offsetting the currency pairs (USDCAD, USDCHF and EURUSD, AUDUSD) was hedging, but by re-reading your blogs I can see there is much more to it than that. Also, by re-reading your blogs I can tell you guys have a very good if not great understanding of the FOREX market. Very impressive. Is Hedging allowed in the USA? Is Tradestation set up to allow hedging? If not, time to switch platforms. Thank you all.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
No broker guarantee a SL or pending price in case of gap in price. The order (pending or SL) is filled at the current available price. I heard that some can guarantee but there's a cost ...

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Thank you Ferrufx. I guess we'll have to keep taking it on the chin until someone can devise a method to stop or limits the gaps. I don't mind slippage, but 150+ pips past your stop loss is not slippage, it's anarchy ( I tend to get carried away sometimes...) How about CAD this morning (8/15/14). Enormous gaps in both directions: GBP/CAD and CAD/CHF. Since I made $$$ (Thank you Scoobi ) I won't complain too much, but that GBP/CAD gain was painful . It was great to be on the good side of the CAD/CHF gap, but the GBP/CAD gap really ate into my CAD/CHF profit. Still, I'm very greatful I finished the week ahead---that doesn't happen too often (actually never. I think this is the 1st time, maybe only the 2nd). I'm sure Tradestation is still scratching their heads... Ferrufx, You are right, news trading isn't for everyone, even experienced traders. As Nico1359 said, "Trading the news is not for the faint of heart." I couldn't agree more, as I am faint of heart. Trading the news is brutal---it definitely puts hair on your chest, that's for sure. Thanks again for ALL the advice you gentlemen are sharing on this blog---very, very helpful.

Hi Guys - anyone have a crack at the USD xxx last nite? 12.30am for me so I needed my beauty sleep.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
yAY Binny, I had good crack on USD data still holding the positions trailing them securing profits infact , EU/GU/AU all cracked down and UJ/UCAD/UCHF up nice one. I carried forward the position with trailing for long since I noticed USD Index was bullish and heading 82+ way to go mate!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Awesome Scoobi - question for you - when you enter long all 6 pairs and direction is established pretty quick ( like the xxxUSD pairs did downards) I understand that shorts are triggered at X2 but do you terminate the longs at all on these 3 or how do you handle that? I have the last 2 attempts closed the 3 losing longs as soon as they are triggered into their short positions which in my case might be ok as I am only targeting $100 - $150 max at this stage. I guess the unknown risk is that price can spike one way then return quickly ?? Have you got a snapshot to look at ? As I said earlier, its after midnite here when rednews comes so I have to be careful I don't miss all those ZZZZZZZZ LOL I think if I can establish a strict &amp; successful set of rules with this, then it will be worth getting up at that time of Nite ( morning ). PM me if you want

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Binny, I go with all 6 in one direction (say buy) on account 1 and all 6 in opp. direction ( say sell) on account 2 before FOMC tonight too, with buy stops and sell stops of all 6 pairs (2x volume) placed on both the accounts . I let atleast 3 out of 6 pending order convert as market orders and I continuously monitor several fundamental and technical readings to gauge the right time to take profits and close it. Hope it helps!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Dammm It - missed a try on FOMC data . Misread the news time - it was actually 6am here so would have been perfect to have a go. Did you go in this one Scoobi ?? Looks as if it was pretty exciting too&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

--- 帖子 #143 ---
hello dear scoobi, i found your thread truly amazing,thanks for your all support and knowledge can you tell me again in case of EU news what pairs do you use or suggest for tarde? best regrds

--- 帖子 #144 ---
good question Persia - I dont have any xxxEUR pairs on my charts but plenty of EURxxx. I tried a straight Hedge last time using the EJ &amp; EU but not a lot of excitement there like we get in the USD crosses. Perhaps Scoobi has some ideas for us here Did you have a go on the FOMC about 3 hours ago ?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Binnie, Please dont feel bad we have Fed Yellen speaking on Friday again she will move markets anyways... I had good pips , this time I didnt close any orders till Chinese HSBC PMI data in asian session which spell dooms for my aud usd sells too , good minting day at work cheers Scoobi!

dear scoobi any comments about the pairs for EU&amp; GBP news? last night for GBP retail sales i didnt have any idea about the pairs so i opened long position on EU/USD,GBP/USD,USD/JPY.USD/CHF,AUD/USD and 5 sell pending position , they are still open now ( 5 long position and 1 sell position)after almost 12 hours,do you have any suggest or advice for me to how i am doing ? best regards

Up and down, up and down, Mr. Market cannot make up it's mind. I'm glad I sat this one out.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
haha if Fed Yellen speaks and ECB Draghi speaks on same day no wonder market makers make it lot volatile and move both sides to hunt stoploss all around. I also sat down Jim didnt trade this " Yellen /Draghi speaks", if Yellen speaks on FOMC Conference makes sense to trade but not during Jackson Hole Symposium and making pairs dance all over

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I completely agree. Good one Scoobi; the market was "hunting for stop losses." As funny as that comment is, that's exactly what was happening. The market was hunting for stop losses up and down all day to see how many trades (and traders) it could ruin. Mr. Market has a mean streak...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hey Guys - what of this weeks coming news is the likely candidate for us to have a go at? Any??​ suggestions

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hey Binnie, Good question. Since I'm still new to this 'News Trading' (and still faint of heart), I was going to ask the same question, but you beat me to it. If I was a guessing man (which I am), I would think that New Home Sales on Monday, 8/25/14 @ 10am (USA time) and Unemployment Claims on Thursday, 8/28 @ 8:30am (USA time) would be good candidates. I'm not too sure about "Consumer Confidence" on Tuesday, 8/26. I don't have enough experience yet. I don't know enough about Australia and New Zealand to offer any useful advice. Hopefully we will all have a successful trading week this week, next week, and every week. As Scoobi would say, "Cheers mates!"

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi JimT, There is so much news these days &amp; it is hard to keep track of . There is an old fashioned way of answering this question and that is to pull up a USD chart and manually check whether news events caused a spike. I have just done a bit of research on this topic and the general comments I see on various Threads on FF is that any news can affect price if it is not what traders are expecting. Makes sense I guess. So to answer my own question I have to say keep an eye on all red news and use FF Calendar to see the historical effects of the various news releases. For anyone interested, I have found this on Investopedia - worth a read for us inexperienced news traders http://www.investopedia.com/articles...dingonnews.asp This is fun - even better if we can make it profitable

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Binnie, Thank you very much--- very helpful advice. Very kind of you to share this very helpful info. I clicked on the link and the article was excellent. At the end of the article was a link to chartadvisor.com, which I also clicked on. I ended up printing everything, which I will re-read many, many times. Binnie, if you ever come to America, I owe you a round of golf at a very nice golf course. Thanks to information like this, you've greatly increased the odds that our trades will become profitable.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
My pleasure buddy - Golf sounds great BTW. Enjoy what Scoobi has shown us but please be careful. The markets can be a....holes at times

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi Scoobidoobi, I think that I can code an EA to follow the way you trade. BTW, can you please confirm: 1/ EA will open trade at special time (I mean time that STRONG NEWS will be release) 2/ EA will open total 12 trades, eample with USD news: 3 buy USDXXX, 3 buy XXXUSD, 3 sell stop USDXXX and 3 sell stop XXXUSD (with 30pips distance) 3/ EA will close all trades when reach profit target (Example: when total profit reach 50 pips or anymore with input value) Right here waiting for you. PS: Hope that you can understand me, sorry because English is not my mother language .

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Thank you Binnie, Very funny post. You are absolutely correct about the markets. I couldn't agree more...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
i had bad experience in trading these events, its hard to be consistent. maybe i this thread will help

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Sounds good Ducdaovn! Following should be inputs : i) Symbol1 to Symbol6 and ii) initiallot /pendinglot along with iii) pip distance for pending order iv) profit target in dollars ==&gt; if it reaches closes all orders including pending orders. Also there is a FFCalendar indicator available, if you can use the same and find out when the next impact news for the chart on which EA is attached would make it completely automated instead of we attaching the EA everytime say 7min before event manually... If you can make an EA for the same we can test it out on few major events and revert back to u....

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Exciting stuff Scoobi - wish I had even a basic idea of building EA's . Ha ha looking forward to being part of this.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Binnie, I know even less than you do. I don't even know what 'EA' stands for, but I completely agree with you---looking forward to being part of this.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
. Stick around JimT - EA means Expert Advisor or in simple terms a sort of programme that will place trades based on the instructions it has been coded with by its maker - in this case , Ducdaovn who will build the EA based on Scoobi's rules . Will be fun to watch its progress.

Aussie RedNews today - tried a hedge set up on my Sim Account - nice spike initially but spat me out real quick . I think the only positive comment I can make is to keep focussed on the USD crosses as originally set out by Scoobi. Anyone have any comments on recent news events?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
binnie, for this week calendar main events are ECB and NFP , first event is EUR XXX (ecb) and other is both USD XXX + XXX USD FOR nfp expecting good moves... Also I heard on Sept 18 there is a big event in GBP on scotland independent vote whether to stay with UK or move out of pound perhaps join euro union that would mean stellar moves on GBP XXX will need to trade if its part of calendar event too... lets see, good pips for u!

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Ya, I found albeit DEMO, to use just the pairs that match by their listings. As in Aussie news to do AUD/USD, AUD/JPY then a listing mirror of those that end in AUD which is just EUR/AUD and GBP/AUD. So, that is 4 trades going one way and 4 going the other on a separate account with matching stop loss and hedge. After just a small sample size of 7 trading days and 5 news trades I am back in the positive by $4. This is trading different country news too not just US. Weak, but im only interested in a small profit at first no matter if it is $0.04 or $4 the rest will come in time. Also a key interest I have found is to keep those trades open for the next trading day or two as those news events that kinda just hit some of the stops and reverse need more time to make up the loss. I am also not trading if there is say AUD rate quote at 8 o'clock then an AUD trade balance at say 10 O'clock. If they are super high important news I find trading the last one to be a little safer. At least in my minds eye.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Cool Monk, thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #175 ---
The Aussie news at EST 9:30pm should be a good set up. I'll be at work but will try to take a break to set up a proper hedge. It is also the last Aussie news for the week. So i have a day or so to let it run before NFP on Friday. I think this is the last one i would do for the week till NFP. Everything is soo clustered this week. GL!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I still don't get how you guys are getting across the Actual Price Filled issue. The entire strategy hinges upon what price the Opposite Pending Orders gets filled at during an explosive volatile news event.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Ronnie I have found that it gets sloppy with some of the trades. Like yesterday while on a break at work I traded the Aussie news 9/3/2014. 4 orders up 4 orders down. The sloppy trade was the long GBP/AUD for the 30 pip stop, after 5 minutes, the stop was hit but my reversed sell order was not filled and cancelled due to spread and slippage. The other stops didn't get touched so I in effect had a hedge of 3 long and 4 short. Long story short I said fine i am not going to re-enter because I still have a GBP/AUD short with a stop on the other account. The market would probably be less volatile when and if it crosses that stop that the order should be filled just fine. I did leave the trades open till New York close 9/4/2014 and it proved good after a nice sell off in the xxx/AUD my "news basket" I would cal it was profitable by about 50$. I need to scale this back to numbers I will be using upon live trading if and when I feel more confident in the system. Which will be more like 5$ profit. Best wishes, Monk.

Dear Scoobi, Today i executed the live trade of NFP using the system.. I decided to BUY the USD/XXX for total 6 pair, however due to NFP result is negative, resulted my trade is having 3 pair is currently is float where another 3 pair was AUTO STOP LOST 1 min before the news was announced but with a GAIN of few cents or USD 1 dollar plus. (Attached image livetrade 1 &amp; 2) i don't know which part i done wrong which resulted the system to perform such action. hope you advice on these matters. Thanks Note: I set the TP profit to be USD150

--- 帖子 #179 ---
It was a bad news spike. I had the same happen it just so happens that one of my baskets of pairs namely usd/jpy, usd/cad, eur/usd, gbp,usd is in the positive. Too much whiplash on this NFP event. Lost half my winnings for the week but i still kept the aformentioned basket open because it could make the loss not so bad. Ohwell I am still thankfull to have had a positive week. Hopefully next week ill catch another mover.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I like that word, "Whiplash." Very accurate description Monk. That's exactly what happened, whiplash (up and down, up and down). Mr. Market was hunting for stop losses, hitting them, and then reversing. I think the market has figured out our Scoobi maneuver.....

If you place order before News, When News come , your order may delay by the sever. Ex: Place buy stop at 1.30000 , when News come , your order was enter at 1.30200. This is because of the traders trade at this time. So, it's better to open two charts , one for buy and one for sell. Don't place order ,just entry before the News about 5 seconds. Entry at 12:29:55 , stop lose for 10~15 pips. News must go North or South. All we need to lose is 10~15 pips for a wrong side. But we can get more than 50~80 pips for the right side. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...37#post7721337

Holding that NFP open on the weekend was no good as i gave up some more of my profit. I did trade the CAD news this morning around 5:30 am est. Believe it was the buildings report. Have a nice positive hedge going on cad/yen, cad/chf vs eur/cad, gbp/cad. I will probably put up a double buffer on the positions that are not hedged at the moment due to being reversed on. I might trade the GBP news today to keep a ongoing "basket" of trades going until I the end of New York tomorrow. This should in effect maximize profits on the CAD news so I can take profit then let GBP basket run one more trading day. Still bright eyed and bushy tailed on this strategy. +20$ demo last week and im up +$10 today but lets see what London brings.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I trade again on CAD pairs last night, still having the same problem.. total 6 pairs was out before the news out, all with profit of few cents till couple dollars.. confuse on these.. Any one had ideas ?? Thanks

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Dear elleel, I traded the same event on monday morning.I just closed it this morning after New York lunch break. I had lost $15.50 to cash out at $40 this morning. What i have been doing is direct matches. Example Eur/Cad to Cad/Jpy. I believe 6 pairs on Cad news is a little bit much. My broker dosnt have a third major pair that starts with Cad/xxx .Also I am leaving these trades open even after the initial spike because i believe the market is gonna move with the news or against after the next session or two. Keep blessed. Monk

--- 帖子 #185 ---
High impact GBP, NZD, and AUD news today. Can't wait. I will be trading all 3 because there is room for them to grow over the next day or 2. Since it is 3 in one day I figure to put each basket of trades at 1/3 the size as to make it like i was trading only 1 news event. Good luck. Pairs will be GBP/USD, EUR/GBP for the 1st news. Then followed by NZD/USD, NZD/JPY, NZD/CAD vs GBP/NZD, EUR/NZD, and AUD/NZD for 2nd news release. The 3rd will look like AUD/USD, AUD/JPY vs EUR/AUD, GBP/AUD. I hope to have closed out positive this week as this is the last trade.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Good luck Monk, The Pound news is at 1.45AM here so will miss that one. The Kiwi &amp; Aussie are in my hours so will have a go on those two the same as you. Post tomorrow .

--- 帖子 #187 ---
GBP news was pretty standard. i have a lopsided hedge due to the filling of orders this time. I will cover any trails with a reverse for positive positions. Now on to NZD.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
gees - I have cocked up here. Used the wrong sim a/c - Once the buys were all in - my provider does not allow hedges so my pendings were all deleted. Tried cancelling some manually &amp; entering at Market on the shorts but just made 1 big mess. What a wally ( LOL ) Did you get a crack at this one Monk??

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Ya I did. So far I have paid what i call entrance fee's into the trades. I have a GBP news "basket" and a NZD " news basket". In an hour i'll set up an AUD trade basket. Should be good once another Europe and US session goes through we'll see. In order to make a hedge on a United States account you need 2 accounts or a sub-account technically. Just remember to limit your exposure and risk by cutting your' usual trades in half to accommodate this type of multiple entries.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Dear Monk, Just finish trade on the AUD news, Im having the same issue as my trade was auto SL, however due to the high impact of the news, i manage to get a profit out of the trade. What i dont understand is why instead of TP, the trade was SL. Is it the setting of the Trailstop is wrongly set. Can u Snap a screen shot of ur setting, say for example i wan a profit USD75. Many thanks &amp; had a great weekend elleell

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I am currently away from my trading computer but I do not set a trailing stop at all. Just a hard stop on each trade. The trades going the opposite direction known as the hedge are left without a stop loss. This in effect balances the risk of exposure. Now I will keep these open until tomorrow so that the trade has room to breathe so that I can cover most if not all the opportunity costs of the basket.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Monk, you mean set the trailling stop to 0 ?? I had try that but still same issue.. hope u can able to snap shotthe setting of ur trade.. I try to chg all the value in the traistop but still same issue.. keep on auto SL.. Pls help

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Yah do not have it trailing. News is too volatile for a trailing stop. You need to just set a 30 pip stop from the entry. Also i use oanda so my charts are a bit different. Ill try to take a picture next week. This week i dont see any good opportunities. Monk

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Howdy Monk - even with my series of cock ups ( errors ) I closed out this morning for a healthy profit ( Practice account only LOL ). Can I PM you mate - I need to run my plan rules by you but before I post them here, I need to be sure I am on the right track otherwise what I say may cause danger to others . Cheers Buddy.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
In all honesty I think its an open forum as of now. The thread starter i believe is active elsewhere. Binnie i would more then welcome any variation or ideas you find help. As for this week I erased my profits going into Thursday. Wednesday night I had 3 baskets equally exposed for a net profit but I made a slight miss calculation that I will try to correct venture forth. Long story short I needed to protect my trades without stops because that big AUD drop today made me pay. (albeit Demo). Thus going forward I am putting reverse orders just like the original entry rules to protect my overnight positions. Instead of making it more of a martingale which I find usefull as the original entry dictates I will be matching the equal amount for overnight positions. I believe that after I had a GBP basket, NZD basket, and a AUD basket that if I protected my open trades I would still have made a profit over the London and New York movements today. All in All I am still excited to follow this strategy through. I have even set up 2 demo sub accounts that would more reflect my actual live account size. $250 and $250. Gotta start somewhere right. I was having an issue with the demo account paying interest on my whole account size of 100,000. This interest made it a little more time consuming to calculate my equity curve. Now with my 1 account split into 2 real size accounts I can here forth take into account the interest my broker pays on my account giving me more insight into the profit factor of the strategy in a real to life setting. Now if only I could quantify the net risk of each news event in say real time or even an hour or two after and identify the risk to reward of such a turn of events. That would be very interesting to see. At the bottom line though just increasing your accounts capital...capitol ? is the name of the game. The monk bids adeu!

--- 帖子 #196 ---
OK Monk - getting ready here for AUD in 2hours from now. Recap the rules :\ Enter Longs on each Pair - 0.10 contract (at 5 - 7 minutes before the News) Set Pending Sell Stops on all pairs - 0.20 contract at 30 pips under the Long entries Wait for strong move - if none happens then cancel all for small loss. Prepare for next major news event..... If there is a strong Spike in price, the odds are that 2 of the pairs will head South and if it is strong enough, the Pending Shorts will be activated. A perfect scenario will be the 2 Longs heading in the right direction &amp; the 2 pending Sells on these pairs will not trigger. The 2 incorrect Longs will now be heading South for a Loss but now there will be Shorts triggered and these will be 2x the losing trades so net effect will be a gain for as long as the trades are allowed to run. Leave all trades open for the day &amp; see if closure is needed after NY Close. Feel free to add on or correct if this is not quite right. Happy Hunting guys. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The birds have been chirping on bloomberg radio about the word hawkish and fed fomc meeting a lot.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Sounds good Binnie. Just Remember to put another order on the trades that have been stopped out and reversed on with a .20 contract. This will ensure you have a stop on all your trades throughout London and New York. Good luck. Currently around Break even on my basket and i have 2 trades that were stopped and re-activated.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Cheers for that Monk - currently about +35 &amp; moving around pretty quick. I am trying hard to follow what you are saying about putting another order on the trades stopped out ??? Can you explain one more time for me please - I cannot see what you mean Where did you have your stops ?? My losing trades are still running &amp; these are 0.1 contracts. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Just make sure that all the trades have a stop. Even the ones that have already doubled. So all the .01 trades let run because you already have the stops. All the .02 trades have a stop in place and put another .02 order ready on the other side of that stop. .01 - stops and orders waiting with .02 .02 - stops and orders waiting with .02 I would recommend only doubling on the initial news release. Then just use .02 until tomorrow after New York. Good luck Binnie. Im currently Up at London open with a small gain but will hold till middle or end of new york. Goodnight it is midnight in California.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Closed all AUD's out with a small loss. I did it right before that huge 30 minute candle in new york. Dont know whaat that would have done to my basket but i dont want to live in the what ifs. Now im open on CAD news at 12:45. Good luck. Binnie I hope your positions were more profitable then mine.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
What the hell was that candle all about Monk ?? It wrecked my basket - woke up an hour ago to see a negative balance I too don't like the Woulda Coulda Shoulda syndrome BUT for the sake of helping us understand the many &amp; varied ways of playing the NEWS strategy, I have spotted something that might be interesting to discuss. A couple of my pairs got involved in what I am going to name as the WHIPLASH EFFECT. How can we guard against this ( Note this is a protection to lessen the effect as we will NEVER eliminate the risk of taking losses up &amp; down on the same trade. I think there are 2 more pieces to this puzzle - between us all I hope we can come up with a strategy we can all benefit from . Teamwork the Key - I will need a bit of time today to prepare a chart or 2 with an explanation of what I am talking about - should get this posted by tonite so bear with me Hey Monk - is it OK for us to be using this thread or should we start a separate one dedicated to Scoobi's ideas. Scoobi Doo Where Are YOU

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Sorry to hear that Binnie, but it is better to flush out the mistakes early on demo before jumping in live. Just remember the losses are inevitable. We need to keep track of how good the wins are compared to the losses. If we insure our trades overnight that should, I believe give us a smaller draw down with the potential to have some of the losers turn into winners. I have a CAD basket from the New York session today 9/16/14. This will be insured with stops into the following New York session. It is positive at the moment but i need to let it run so that it can become a great winner. I know the market can do anything like wipe away my open winnings, but I feel we need to take smaller losses on those winnings until we get a big healthy winner to pay us back and then some. The whiplash effect will always be there. My proposal is to have the market move away from the whiplash area in the time frame of 1 day. If it dose not work out I will shut the basket down and wait for the next opportunity. It is a kind of timed stop loss on top of my hard stops that I reset within that period of 1 day. I plan on trading the NZD news tomorrow 9/17/14 after I shut down my CAD basket. I will trade the final red USD news on thursday 9/18/14 after the NZD basket goes out. I am trying to stay away from GBP for the reasons that on thursday the market will get shaken by the independence vote. I will keep updated as to how these dominoes play out.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
CAD basket was closed for a small profit. Still a negative balance on one account and a small profit on the other. Lets go NZD! I need another one

--- 帖子 #205 ---
NZ BASKET NOW CLOSED ( terminated at NY Session Close ) This was an experience and well worth the effort. The basket was allowed to run even though FOMC was looming. My style will differ slightly to Monk's but I think we are reasonably close in approach. I have entered all 6 longs at News minus 5mins. Pending Shorts set at 30 pips except for the Pound which from my experience requires a little more space . I used 45 for that pair. Next step for me was to place a safety net on all trades so Stops on the Longs were set around the Pending Short levels ( approx 30pips) and the Stops for the Pending Shorts were set back at the initial Long entries. My plan allowed for a maximum of 2 losses per pair and this did happen last night when I got Spiked into a short on the NJ and it travelled back up to the Long entry. So I took a double whammy there. I would like to post a chart for all pairs but these would be repetitive so I have attached a screenshot of a good trade and also the Yen bad one. A screen shot is also attached to show net result at NY Session close . Can these results be expected all the time - I guess not , but I think there is enough in the strategy to discuss and see if we can make it a high probability set up.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Nice work binnie. I made some net on that set up too. Just got out before FOMC. NZD GDP is here im already set up. Good Luck!

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Mate - pretty exciting seeing some of these numbers but still a lot of work to do eh ? I just tuned in to the NZ GDP but doesn't look too exciting. If there is not much movement, what do you do personally ? You are in your longs obviously so are you just gonna wait it out to see what direction the market wants to move for the day or do you take a wee hit and close them all out? I have also had a look at the FOMC which hit a few hours ago. Not too sure how relevant this info will be in hindsight but interesting anyway. Thought I would share my findings if anyone interested. A couple of the pairs were spiked both ways so these losses were 30 Long and 60 Short . The others are still in process and I will leave them open until NY Session close tomorrow. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I am leaving them open till the last US RED news tomorrow. Then I will trade that with a different basket. The NZD looks like a small news release but i think that since the basket is up and running it is more of an opportunity cost to not leave it open. London and New York will move these out of the range and into a small loss or a small win. If we get it right a big win .

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Just doing my update for the USA News Basket. Decided to close the FOMC news before this lastest Building Permits / Unemployment/Yellen/Manufacturing. Started a New Basket and these are currently standing as follows: EU + 49 GU + 10 AU + 40 UCad + 16 Now Short with 2x value UChf - 2 " " " " UJ - 6 Stuck at original Long Entry Will leave these overnite now till Lunchtime Fri New York . Only thing that might stuff things up is Scottish issue. Could whiplash both ways &amp; take both Stops.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hey guys, hows it all going on this news trading system? I'm about to start demoing it, got any fresh suggestions or ideas? Question. Does the 30 pip distance for the pending orders always get filled? I know not all news is newsworthy and some does not move the market at all... What is your experience with news that does not move the 30 pips to hit your pending orders, or takes it, but then retraces? Do you just manually get out asap if its not a big mover? Cheers!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I agree---good luck to us all

What happened to all of the October and November threads?? Did you guys retire? Rich, I hope...

Hola guys, last friday NFP was big JACKPOT with this concept. As USDXXX had excellent raise after strong NFP(thanks to USDJPY in particular ) and XXX USD fell apart (thanks to EUR USD in particular)

Fantastic Binnie, you are the MAN !! Sorry I was bit away but last NFP on 2/6 hope you made KILLER $$ with this concept. cheers fella!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Verve no more worrying about doing this manually and staying hedged n all that.. i have automated for good reason not just on specific pairs infact applies for most pairs..

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi Scoobi, Are you using still this method with profit or have you improved it ? I have created a small EA with your initial rules.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Sure madscalp, please go ahead and post the EA. Method is profitable "as-is" over the long run. Trade explorer attached on the thread is slightly tweaked version to trade other news/events too.. Thanks! Scoobi

--- 帖子 #218 ---
OK I'm checking some points and I post it tomorrow What are the differences with your tweaked version ?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Tweaked version deviates the original principle of staying hedged before the event rather relies on pure price action adding straddle techniques.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Here is the first version of the EA I developed based on the strategy described in Post 1. This version has not been tested yet. Usage: The user clicks on the Fire! button on the upper right side of the chart the EA attached to a few minutes before NFP/FOMC news release time, and the EA executes the strategy. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Edit: The EA updated to Version 1.10.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hello MathTrader, i have tested this Ea in the London opening session today , every thing went perfect trades are opened as per the strategy but today the market little slow at London session so after few minutes the hedge pending orders of 0.2lot got closed and market went down after the bids those bids are closed , as a result as there is no hedge the open trades 0.1 buys went to negative , so may be these pending orders shld not be closed after fixed time and also if possible add both buy and sell baskets Thank you

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Thanks for testing and the bug report. Here is Version 1.10 of the EA that fixes bugs.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
can u add both buy and sell baskets ?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
You want the EA open both BUY and SELL basket at the same time? I can implement it, but it is not according to the strategy described in Post 1.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
no not at the same time , we can use any of them like basket 1 : 0.1 all buy orders and 0.2 pending as sell basket 2: 0.1 all sell orders and 0.2 pending all buy give the option to use any one because today the market is down trend and we are placing buy orders

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I was thinking about adding two buttons, one for Buy basket and another for Sell basket. I also think that it would perfectly make sense to have both options. I'll implement such feature in the next versions.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
thank you

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I think techlover is talking about this:

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Here is Version 1.30 of the EA that implements the Buy/Sell Basket buttons, and the Close Basket button. Attached Image (click to enlarge) After the fire the buttons look like this: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #230 ---
great work math perfect !

--- 帖子 #231 ---
you are right MAXX , but not in two accounts , i think while palcing the trades , we shld look for the trend of EURUSD and GBPUSD and place the basket according to the trend, Ex: today london opening EUR and GBP went down with good volume but reverse pair like USDCHF , USDCAD and USDJPY has no volume to cover the minus of EUR and GBP , so if the market is like this its better we go with the trend of big pairs like EUR and GBP

--- 帖子 #232 ---
You're welcome! Let's see how the strategy works this Friday!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi all, Many issues with my EA....so thanks to MathTrader I don't think we can use this system at London open and look at the trend. Scoobidoo use it only before the news.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
this is the result of first trade 1.0 lot with 100 as target Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #235 ---
What was the underlying news event for that trade?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
lolz no news just normal trade

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Here is a similar result with 0.1 lot and 10 USD target:

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Great coding MathTrader It's possible to get also the target in percentage of balance ?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Fantastic Job MathTrader, you made the EA very interactive and colorful.Let's put to test on NFP Live this friday on 2 different a/cs one for BUY Basket and other for SELL Basket and collect some pips as posted. cheers!

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Nice, thank you MT for the new toy ;-) Testing will be fun. Best, Josh

--- 帖子 #241 ---
You're welcome! :-) Let's see how the EA and the strategy works this Friday ;-)

--- 帖子 #242 ---
You're welcome! :-) I'll add that feature to the EA in the next versions...

--- 帖子 #243 ---
You're welcome! :-) I have the same plan for this Friday. I'll run both Buy and Sell basket on two demo accounts a few minutes before NFP news release time. Let's see what happens ;-)

--- 帖子 #244 ---
We can test tomorrow on the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Good idea! I will test the EA tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Today I opened two baskets, first a buy basket and then a sell basket, both closed with the target profit (10 USD).

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I just wanted to mention that you can use only one demo account for opening a Buy and a Sell basket at the same time, if you attach the EA to two charts and set different Magic Numbers to them.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Guys i don't understand the main logic here if you are trading in news time , how much profit are you expecting from single news , if you are getting only 30 to 40 pips with the whole basket then what is the point of waiting for news time, in a moth you will hardly get 3 to 4 news of that much movement and even if this strategy fail in one news also it will be waste of time

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Third basket was also closed in profit today: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It seems that the strategy works well with a judgement about the trend of EURUSD during LONDON session.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
OK but how to choose buy or sell basket at L.O ?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
MathTrader7, Thanks Scoobidoobi, for the concept of trading NEWS this way. Also Thanks to MathTrader7 for this very quick and clean EA for USD. Much appreciated. Are you planning to make options for trading other currencies, such as JPY, EUR, etc..? Would be nice if you would consider doing so. Thanks. Bruce

--- 帖子 #252 ---
IMO it's possible but the highest volatility is with USD

--- 帖子 #253 ---
If someone used it today US timings would have made some pips with huge moves in EU,GU,AU,NU (Raise) and UCAD,UJ.UCHF (Drop) very good stuff from math trader during volatile times also. But folks its 100% USD hedged system still caution advised don't put huge lots at stake use proper Money management and make some pips easily..

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Scoobidoobi, Thanks. Great idea here -- 100% USD hedged system. Bruce

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Thank you. Which broker did you use? The EA is not functioning on mine.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I use IC Markets , demo account with no problem.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
DONT KNOW HOW TO USE MATHTRADER ea, dont understand suffix of pairs part, what does that mean?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
If your broker uses a suffix for pairs such as EURUSDmicro, you need to set Suffix of Pairs to micro.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Today I randomly decided to open a Sell basket, and it was also closed in profit:

--- 帖子 #261 ---
whats the most open DD youve seen so far with this? whts ur acc balance on .1 lot

--- 帖子 #262 ---
ScooBidoobi TE gone, the only time traders take out TE is when they goo BOOM!! anyway great system and great mind bro, 500% in two days, seems like you werent using breaks, keep up the good work bro! youre an intelect, great system!

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thanks Soros, I think you are new to this thread. I generally pull out funds once I hit 500% boom (not going Kaboom lol) , this is the second time it hit the target in last 2 weeks. Will repeat and rinse back. It's like benchmark for the system to get the target where I take profits n restart it from scratch. cheers!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
which system did you use because clearly you didnt use news system? did you use your other hedge system?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi all, I already tried math EA during the last US red new and worked great. Closed in profit of 100 using 1 lots. During periods of high volatility seems to work well. Will try later on ISM.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Good Job Chucrut!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
It's slightly tweaked advanced version of EA uses the concept for news trading or high volatility trading in general

--- 帖子 #268 ---
in the news trading strategy, whats the risk realy, whats the worst that could happen that can cause either huge DD or huge risk or the worst BOOOOOM!!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
This strategy needs a rather large account size.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
there's hedge pending orders waiting for the -ve orders running to cover them and bring it to positive.., DD depends on Money management setup with smaller lots n make would be ideal

--- 帖子 #271 ---
TESTED $1000 ACC size using 0.1lot, max open DD was $35, so please explain your findings, im fairly new here.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
is this one works on live account?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
It may blow up a live account, so we are testing the strategy (and the EA) on demo accounts at the moment.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I opened two baskets Buy and Sell 4 minutes before ISM news at the same time, on the same demo account with different magic numbers. Both baskets closed in profit:

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Just closed the basket of the ISM in within just 7 minutes with a profit of 100 using 1 lot. Largest DD was -220. Also thinking if would be a good option that the EA close the position when the waiting pending order get triggered. Thanks math, scoobie for the work. Waiting for friday now.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
You're welcome! :-) I didn't get your point?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
whats your worst DD in terms of % so far, what has to happen to experience a margin call?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
So far the worst DD was 27%.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Sorry for my english, try to explain. We open a buy basket, in the pairs that go south when the double sized pending order get triggered (sell in this case) why not close the original buy order and let go only the new one? Just thinking if the basket would filled early.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Now I got your idea

--- 帖子 #281 ---
damn risky... using 1k .1lot?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
that's why, i tried it on my micro account, nothings happen.. thanks

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Here is Version 1.35 of the EA that fixes a few minor bugs. In this version, first the market orders are closed and then pending orders.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Yes, 1K account with 0.1 lot size. It is for sure risky!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
What if market reversed from there ? It already happened to me we may loose at least 100 pips, and our target with the second orders has to include this lost 100 pips so it will very difficult

--- 帖子 #286 ---
were you trading news?

No, just testing by entering the market randomly.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
oh thats why

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Very interesting Math You had opened both at the same time and both are winners. It's the proof than before news we can try buy and sell. However I have a doubt about a random use.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Don't deviate from major USD news NFP/FOMC , they are the biggest market movers. If you are trying on other news use micro lots to make low risk pips. good luck!

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I'm guessing this strategy goes against US FIFO rules?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I agree. It's a good strategy only before news.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I'm looking for a board on my chart to visualize the NFP news according with my broker time ( FXCM ). Many thx.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I thought that on what i saw during the news (only 2 times right now, have to test more). I put at lower distance the pending orders (20 pips) and it filled the basket quickly. With a reduced distance and during very high impact news at the time it reverse i hope my basket will be already close, but maybe you are right, i have to test more. And we have to remember that is totally different trying this demo o real. And writing this i had this crazy idea: if market reverse, where was the original order we will put a new double sized pending order. I try to explain better. We buy 0.1, it go south and trigger the pending sell of 0.2 and close the buy, then reverse and where was the original buy it will be a 0.04 new buy pending order. I think that soon or later the basket will be filled. Have to check the DD. Just an idea. Something like martigale. What do you think?

Random test, one side at a time with direction decision by eyes, all closed in profit ... nice Thanks for sharing. RS Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

e.g. Thanks MT7 - appreciate you sharing your coding with us. I would like to suggest an added selection option. in post 1 the strategy rules was set to trade USD-X. and your code does that. But these trades/testers have been using the same rules on other news/currencies. Will it be posable to add the 4 mayor currency crosses. you can then create an "case" statement for the different currencies. e.g. case selection option 1 - USD-x 2 - GBP-x 3 - EUR-x 4 - AUD-x the trader then select the currency that will be impacted by the news. the EA will open the 6 trades for the currency as in the rules of post1 when it NFP - the trades select USD-x, when its AUD CPI you select AUD-X or the other option is the let the trades manualy enter the 3 currency to sell and the 3 currencies to buy. e.g. Sell-input: (AUDUSD,EURUSD,GBPUSD) or (EURUSD,EURAUD,EURJPY) Buy-input: (USDCAD,USDCHF,USDJPY) or (EURCAD,EURNZD,EURCHF) Hope it make sense. Regards Leon

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hmm yeah thats a good idea but have to test it practically

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Good idea but first let's see how the strategy works for NFP/FOMC news.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I would like to ask to math if he could implement this feature so we can test it. I thought this also: every time a pending order get triggered where was the opposite order will appear a new opposite and double sized pending order. I think in this way we can try also to operate the moments of strenght or weakness of the currency and not only news, or try to put it randomly on the market to see how it work. I think that the market wont stay in a range of 200 or 300 points forever (the distance between the original orders), soon or later the basket will be filled. For example: 1 - At price X open buy of Z lots 2 - At price X - Y pips put pending sell of 2xZ lots if 2 get triggered: 3 - At price X put pending buy of 4xZ lots if 3 get triggered: 4 - At price X - Y pips put pending sell of 8xZ lots4 and so on... And i thought that maybe is better don't close the trade when the opposite pending get triggered because if the new one reverse, the first could balance a little. Just my thoughts. Waiting for opinions, and for tomorrow NFP.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
This afternoon ( for me in France) both baskets buy and sell winners 2 x 20 $ = 40 $ We have a good system before news ...thx scoobidoo. just a question: why the pending orders are at 30 pips ? any important reason ?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
To avoid whipsaws if you keep it so close, market might hit and reverse hence the reason madscalp

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I understand the principle but why especially 30 pips ? It's your experience ?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Today I opened a Sell basket 5 minutes before Unemployment Claims news, and the basket closed in profit (target 50 USD):

--- 帖子 #304 ---
The same here. Waiting for tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
and the buy basket too

--- 帖子 #306 ---
However I don't like the idea to open 2 baskets at the same time because we pay two times spread and commissions. We have to create 2 groups the buyers and the sellers and see after 2-3 weeks if a basket is better than other

--- 帖子 #307 ---
What you suggest is just to do Martingale. The strategy itself is risky, so let's not adding more risk to it at the moment.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thank you. I have the IC platform and still the EA does not open trades. How do use the EA at anytime?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
This is not Auto Ea , you have to trade manually to open buy basket press Fire Buy to open sell basket press Fire sell

--- 帖子 #310 ---
tomorow NFP and FOMC, gona go live due to the volitility of both releases.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Would be nice to have an optional function to fire buy and sell trades by a timer, e.g. 5 min before news, set by trader manually. RS

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Attachment hi there. great post and idea. really glad i spot this thread in time. NFP today soon. I tried to open 3 pairs Short USD XXX and 3 pair Short XXX USD as explain in the thread, all done. and open 6 set of Buystop with double the position size earlier. OK all done. EA put onto chart... And i made sure everything is ticked, Allow live trade bla bla, but i see nothing happened ? The EA doesnt close trades or do anything ... Autotrading button in MT4 is press on as well. When i press FireSell or Firebuy nothing happen , as well as Close Basket. Question : What is the button function of FireBuy and FireSell and Close Basket? it suppose to close all trades rite? can someone explain ? are there anything i miss or skip doing ? thank you so much !! Attached Image (click to enlarge) in the end i manually close all the trades, and it was in profit ! , buystop triggered.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
You attach the EA to a chart, a few minutes before NFP news release you click on either Fire Buy! or Fire Sell!, the EA executes the strategy. Note: The EA only works on demo accounts at the moment.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
only works when near NFP data? ok... i guess now only manual trades for NFP then. Do you cancel the pending order after the nfp data comes out? or keep it open ?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
please make it work live acc!! wana trade NFP today!

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Here is Version 1.40 of the EA that trades on Live accounts. Attached File(s) MathTrader7_NFP_Hedge_EA.ex4 138 KB | 549 downloads Note: The EA has not been fully tested yet, so there may be some bugs that cause your account blow up. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK, I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
MathTrader - live accounts only? Or will this work on demo and live? Is it the same as the earlier version except for that?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Works on both Demo and Live accounts. I fixed a few minor bugs in this version as well.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Thanks. Also, a set of instructions would be good. I'm scrolling through the 16 pages and not really finding out everything I want to know. Correct me where I'm wrong: Attach to any chart. 7 minutes before the news, hit the "Fire BUY" button. EA places 6 buys, and 6 pending sells 30 pips away, on the pairs described in Post 1 of this thread. When you have 10 dollars profit (if original settings were left intact), it closes all open and pending orders (basket close). 20 minutes after the news, if profit target is not hit, all open and pending orders are closed. Stops need to be set and adjusted manually or with a different EA. At any time, user can hit "Close Basket" and all open and pending orders which were opened by this EA will be closed. Is that it?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
That's right! However, the EA doesn't close the basket after 20 minutes. The user must close the basket whenever he/she thinks that there is no point of keeping the basket open. Also, the EA will not set any stop loss for the orders, the stop loss of the initial orders are the pending orders in fact.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Of course, I'm demo-ing on Oanda , so I'll get chewed to shreds by the spreads , LOL!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
loving the work of both Scoobie and MathTrader7. lets see how today plays out.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
thanks for strategy. very cool. please why not release code? T minus 15

--- 帖子 #324 ---
You're welcome! :-) Please note that all the EAs, indicators and scripts that I post here in FF are free but not open-source. This is my personal policy.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
That was fun, and I made 33 pips on demo. But, I'm not sure what I was seeing. Some of the buys were closing out automatically, I don't know why. None of them had a stop loss, I just went with the hedge. When I saw a couple hundred pips profit, I hit the "Close Basket" button. Might be just luck I ended up with 33.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Maybe you had margin stop out where your broker starts closing the orders with the highest loss one by one until you will have enough margin...

--- 帖子 #327 ---
MathTrader7, where is the best place to start to learn to code for mt4

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Incredible ...after news and the big volatility for any reason the pending orders of my buy basket are gone and now I see a huge DD

--- 帖子 #329 ---
buy basket... on demo AC

--- 帖子 #330 ---
No, it's a $60,000 demo account and I was trading the 0.1 lot. Losses varied from $4 to $71. gains from 0 to $54.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I just hope it is a demo account. I tried to warn people not go live with this strategy (and the EA) until it has been fully tested to be profitable.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Yes it's in demo but I don't understand why the pending are disappeared during the bounce any idea ? I think if the pending had worked the basket would in gain

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I checked the code. There is no way in which the EA deletes the pending orders in the situation happened to you. They may be deleted by the broker according to some policy.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
NFP results here: tried one buy and one sell basket. The BUY worked great, reached the target in only few minutes thanks to the pending orders but the SELL terminated in a huge DD due to the initial spike that activated 1 double sized pending buy. Let's see in a while during FOMC how it works. I'm still of the idea that we have to think about if the market reverse after atcivated the pendings...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
What causes you to trade the Buy or Sell Button? Thanks for your response.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
You're right Math. It's probably due to broker. It seems nobody has had this issue.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
You can't hedge in oanda. Try a different broker

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Thanks for mentioning it. I just want to highlight it. OANDA broker does not allow the traders to open hedge positions. So this strategy and the EA won't work on neither Live nor Demo accounts of OANDA.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hey MT. It depends which branch you have the account open in. I have Oanda Europe and my accounts have hedge option. If you are in NA, then FIFO, hedge and other rules apply. Best, Josh

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Probaly has to do with Oanda - they don't allow hedging, so when the pending sell was hit, the buy was closed out...

--- 帖子 #341 ---
need help i got the advisor installed and working but it don't trade. I press the fire sell, fire buy, close basket. nothing happens what am i doing wrong???

--- 帖子 #342 ---
If you are using it on a Live account, you need to download Version 1.40.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Im trying on a demo, but i will update and test it. thanks for the help and the EA. Edit: nevermind, it worked on another broker (hotforex) but i can't make it work on EXNESS . Thanks for the EA and the help. Happy weekend

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi peeps I have a question regarding this strategy. I understand in this strategy we open hedged trades. My question is what if after NFP the pending orders are triggered and immediately after the market turns and goes the other way. I have tried a similar strategy before and got slaughtered when it happened. How do you plan on dealing with that scenario?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
no one trade this on nfp to show???

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I am sorry, but my mt4s crashed on my vps. Thats what I get for running 4 platforms at once. Best, Josh

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi Math, I hope you are fine . Any restrictions for backtesting ? I get loading Errors. Best, Verified

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hello Verified, I am fine, thanks mate :-) it cannot be backtested since the strategy opens a basket of 6 pairs while the strategy tester only loads one currency pair data.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
thanks, i should have known best, verified

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi MathTrader7, Nice bit of work, the EA works well and is a little harvester of pips. I am wondering if you could add to the input box on to EA to allow us to change the currency selections to a selection other than the six selected, Six boxes for the currencies with the user free to make the selection of the currencies to use. If a box was left blank then only the remaining currency inputs would be used for the EA. Many thanks, appreciate your skills. Pipernet.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hello pipernet, The EA implements the strategy described in Post 1. You can use a basket EA such as the one programmed by sellers9.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
hi, i entered random ( eurusd ) 10 hours ago on demo and forgot it. now i checked: +63 USD, default settings, latest ea. usd 500 account. cheers, verified.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Take profit of the default settings is 10 usd ;-)

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi MathTrader7 Very good, will have a look there, meanwhile your EA working nicely, 4 runs already closed at TP of 10 on a quiet day like today. Many thanks again, Pipernet.

I used this EA yesterday on unemployment news and it was brilliant. Hit TP targer in less than a minute. Congratz Mathtrader, well done But i used the Fire Sell, and EURUSD drop as we know. I wonder what would be the results if i used the fire buy? What is the diference and when to use one or another? I did not get it yet.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
i think the exit rules can also be added in this ea ...Mathtrader would you please add this as an exit

fomc in 2 hours. tum de tum.

EA has bugs, sometimes it puts 2 pending orders, sometimes 4 and sometimes 6

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Best way to trade FOMC/NFP is to shut down your PC unless u have insider info

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Used this EA for tonight FOMC on 3 demo accounts. Hit Fire buy on 2 and fire sell on 1. Ended up between £150 and £200 down on all 3 accounts. Just a thought - Any thoughts on an similar EA but adapted in the following way - Fire buy = buy USDXXX pairs and sell XXXUSD pairs with 2x sell / buy stops placed accordingly on all pairs at a set distance . Fire sell = sell USDXXX pairs and buy XXXUSD pairs with 2x buy / sell stops placed accordingly on all pairs at a set distance. This would potentially be profitable according to which way the USDX is moving and which button is pressed. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
the ea seems to work well but the strategy seems to be a disaster. add some sl and tp or a trailing stop or something and maybe it will have half a chance.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
i traded this FOMC , with similiar strategy,just one min before the news, i open up a buy bucket (30pip Sl, 30pip TP setup) on 4 pairs - USDAUD , USDJPN USDCHF and USDGBP ... the market smashed me by diving down on on news release , hitting pending to become shorts (2x previous lot) .... and it burst again.... then i manually open new buy trades and cover back my trades - disaster can happen with this system, need some tweak

--- 帖子 #328 ---
looking at it again, aud usd seems to be missing from ea trades. tested again, works ok, maybe because didnt have symbol open in market watch.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I decided to try this and had very good results. First I checked the USDX and seen that it had found support and was starting to retrace. So as stated above I bought the USDXXX pairs ond sold the XXXUSD pairs. I also placed the 2 x Sell/buy orders as per the 1st post on this thread. I decided not to place any Stop Loss on the initial buy/sell orders so that they would reduce the damage caused if the pending orders were activated and then price retraced. I did place Stop Losses on the pending orders. I let this run through the night and by this morning I was over 100 up - none of the pending orders were activated. I know this differs from the initial idea but it seems to make more sense to me. Anyone agree? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Was it something i said? Lol. Oh well in case anyone is interested I made over £800 overall on the above trades and decided to close at that point. Pity it was only a demo account. Does anyone know if there is an Ea that will execute something similar to what I did? Can do manually but would be much easier with an Ea.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Very nice ! Now FXCM just needs to keep the MT4 server running during high impact events so that we can actually trade and get rid of the "off quotes" trade reject error !!! hahahahah

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi CatMan, The "Off quotes" messages you received mean the price that was available in the market at the time in question was outside the Maximum Deviation range you specified for your order. The Max Dev feature on MT4 protects you from having your order filled with more slippage than you can tolerate. If you find you are getting the "Off quotes" message frequently, then consider increasing your Maximum Deviation . With most MT4 brokers, the Max Dev feature limits both positive and negative slippage equally, but we have enhanced the Max Dev feature on the FXCM MT4 platform to limit only negative slippage. That's why a study of over 43 million orders executed through FXCM over the course of a year showed that overall our clients experience more positive slippage than negative slippage .

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Here is Version 1.41 of the EA that fixes few bugs in the previous version.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hello Mathtrader, I have been using your EA since last week &amp; my acc is up 6%, thanks for sharing. Does this version of the EA include a TP level when trading it in a live account?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
welldone mathtrader n silver

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Where SL set? How many pips ? It can open position and change direction..

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi, help me please, this EA installed on MT4 from Exness , XM , ICMarkets and Forex4you shows sad face What can be wrong there? Thanks

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi, I know the answer now: ‘Tools’, then ‘Options’, then ‘Expert Advisors’ and check the ‘Allow automated trading’ box. But there is another question: EA opens only 4 pairs for me: E/U G/U A/U U/J I expected 6 pairs.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi, sorry, 4 pairs only can be because of low Margin Level but... one question more: what does Inputs' Magic Number mean? Thanks

--- 帖子 #340 ---
How did this week FOMC go about folks , it was very little moment against USD.. I presume..

--- 帖子 #341 ---
This week has plenty of data : RBA Interest Rate BOE Interest Decision NFP Watch out for more pips

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi there! I'm a brand new forex trader and I came across this post. Even though a while has passed since you started this post, is this strategy still making you good profits? And I'm assuming that this strategy works for other news releases aside from NFP and FOMC?
