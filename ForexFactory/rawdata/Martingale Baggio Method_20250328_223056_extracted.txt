Hello, I have a sort of Martingale system, I have back tested, manually and this system seems pretty good and has not failed, from Nov 2007 to date only pair I have looked at is USD-JPY. Might work on other pairs with low spread. If you are looking to make millions, then this is not the system that you would look at, unless you have millions TF --------- 15min Rules: ---------- At 7am GTM, go in the direction of the 6:45am candle with, i.e 0.01 lot, if you get stopped out, then X 4 your lot (0.04 lot) and go in the direction that you have been stopped out, if you get stopped out again, then go in the direction you have been stopped out X 4 for yout lot (0.16) until you hit profit and then close shop and be done for the day. TP/SL based on pairs with LOW spread. TP ---------- 10 not including spread SL ---------- 10 including spread Comments Welcome, will attach charts and spread sheet which has come from FXTradePro, it is freely available to use.

See MM here...

--- 帖子 #3 ---
If you look at the rea line here, you would enter after that candle closes. 1. Go long, then you would be stopped and then you would reverse and go short. 2. You would get stopped out going short. 3. Reverse and go long and you would win 10 pips and £/$11-00 for the day.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Actually $/£6-00

--- 帖子 #5 ---
On current MM from above: $/£1 profit on first trade. 16th Jan

--- 帖子 #6 ---
15 min TF = short. Just checking entries on 5 min TF 1. Short - Might have got stopped out first entry,depending on broker + spread 2. Long - Stopped out. 3. Short - TP HIT P/L = £/$6-00 Based on the above calculations.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
15 min TF 1. Short entered. TP 10 hit P/L = £1/$1 Based on MM from above.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
17th Jan. 15 min TF long 1. Long stopped. - red line 2. Short stopped - 2nd red line 3. Long - 10 pip TP hit P/L = £/$6-00

--- 帖子 #9 ---
So for this week. P/L = £/$26-00 Backtest yourself and have a look and let me know the number of winning trades against lost trades, max trades would be 5/6, though at the end you'll profit, most will get hit around 3/4 or before. If someone can code an EA for this, this would be great! Would do the prefect job!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
How do yo realize the backtesting? Do you study every day since nov-2007? how much succesfull trades you get in porcentage? thanks

--- 帖子 #11 ---
It's a loser. Martingales are one of the biggest mistakes of new traders. There is a thread like this every week or so. Martingales do not work, in the long run. They are based upon a logical fallacy. They were mathematically debunked centuries ago.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
fair play billbss I have back tested this on a ranging day and it still pulls in. if you have tight SL and TP and 1/1 ratio and high volume and it being volatile... i.e when the market opens... then why not... give me a random day to pick and I'll do a back test on the day...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
yes I did... does not take long...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
oh man..please...this is VERY DANGEROUS. Look at more about "Kelly criteria" money managment...has risk, but i think that is less... just a clue Best Regards, Marcelo Marques

Hi guess121: I've attached a .zip file with 3 backtest reports on GBPUSD pair of an EA that uses a martingale as money management, from 06/20/2006 to 01/23/2008. One of them was tested buying and selling at the same time (test). The second one was tested only buying. And the third only selling. I think this tests what happen with some trades skipped when a martingale is open in the opposite direction. I tested also the following pairs: EURJPY, EURUSD, CHFJPY, USDJPY &amp; USDCHF, with good results (70% to 120% annual profit). The best one was GBPUSD. Since 01/02/2008 i am foward testing the EA online, until next month, when i'm going to get in with real money if the results are as expected. Perhaps 100% annual is too low for someone. But it's nice for me. Warning: I'm a newie trader (since 10/20/2006) that only lose money. I just post this to talk serious about martingale as a money management style. Rama

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hey Rama, how r u? Great results with this EA. I´m testing some martingale systems too. Can u share this ea that u send the statment? Regards! Numeral

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Martingale typically results in a doubling down of the amount just lost. But it looks like you're quadrupling down after each loss. I think there's a fair chance that may not work out in the long haul.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
woo, I saw your threads everywhere about the same method and request for the programmer to solve it. Please take a look on http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=61986 To people who think Martingale do not work in the long run. I agree Martingale may kill people in one day. Yet I feel MM and downside multiplier is good way to solve it. FxTraderPro doing well in Lucky 7 Setup in this aspect. Feel Free to have comment here

Hi Numeral, I'm posting the ea improved and tested on GBPUSD pair on larger time period (06/01/2004 - 01/28/2008), downloaded from Alpari. You need to install AllOrdersControl.mq4 in the include folder. Soon i'm going to test USDCHF and EURJPY on the same time period. I'm also posting 3 reports on GBPUSD: 1. The EA buy &amp; sell. The EA manage only one type of trades at a time. If there is a buy order open and a sell signal appears, it is ignored. 2. Only buy. To see what happen with each buy signal. 3. Only sell. Idem 2. I'm foward testing it in the same pair in two different charts. One only buy, the other only sell. They show more trades working separately on different charts, than the buy &amp; sell on the same chart. I think this can improve profits, and you optimize margin usage. Lets tests and see. Regards.

Don't work for me http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif Both in Expert folder ? Is't right ?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Madscalp, On the chart you dropped the EA press F7. On page "Common", mark the case "Allow live trading". Do this on each EA/Chart you use. Don't forget to allow Expert Advisor, pressing the botton in the middle of the tool bar (I' don't know how to put here an image of it). Good luck. Rama

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Sorry, Rama I used several EA located in expert folder successfully but with yours, nothing: it's impossible to install the EA however I see MA martingale and allorderscontrol in my left panel I don't understand

--- 帖子 #23 ---
hi rama, tried the EA, but it will not add me to the chart at all. regards, guess

--- 帖子 #24 ---
this is the error I get when trying to complie. they are both in the same folder: 2;76;C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\MA Martingale v2.1.mq4;26:1;'AllOrdersControl.mq4' - cannot open the program file

--- 帖子 #25 ---
The file AllOrdersControl.mq4 must be copied on the folder \Program Files\MetaTrader4\experts\include. I forget something very important: CHANGE THE MAGIC NUMBER of the EA ON EACH CHART. The EA recognize its orders from this number. Good luck. Rama

--- 帖子 #26 ---
i thought it might be that... did it and worked... also Rama, can you please add time function to this? i.e start trading at this time, and if any trades open, then close all trades at by a certain time? thanks guess

--- 帖子 #27 ---
hi rama... can we get an explaination of all the variables as well? thanks, guess

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hey Rama! Thank You. I start the tests today. Let´s see what i get. I will try it also in most pairs i have. Regards

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Can you attach MA Martingale V2.1 at yours charts ? I put this file in expert folder and allorderscontrols in expert &gt; include but nothing works

--- 帖子 #30 ---
This are the setting of the Expert Advisor MA Martingale v2.1.mq4: 1. Copy file "MA Martingale v2.1.mq4" to the folder \Program Files\MetaTrader4\Experts. 2. Copy file "AllOrdersControl.mq4" to the folder \Program Files\MetaTrader4\Experts\Include. 3. Start MetaTrader4. 4. Open Navigator window and find the expert advisor. Then click and drop the EA "MA Martingale v2.1.mq4" on the chart you want. 5. Be sure to "Allow live trading" on "common" page of the expert properties (Press F7 on the chart you dropped the EA). 6. Be sure to Allow Experts Trading by pressing botton beside MetaEditor botton on the tool bar. It must change a red stop bottom to a green play bottom. Thats all.

These are the EA parameters explanation: a) #include &lt;AllOrdersControl.mq4&gt; //Place in memory the array containing orders executed by EA. It makes faster and secure execution of it. b) TakeProfit=30; //Fixed pip profit target on each order. c) PipsStep=25; //Fixed pip loss until a new order is entered in the same way. If the previous order lost a number of pips equal to PipsStep, it enters a new one following martingale parameters. d) MaxTrades = 7; //Maximum number of orders in a martingale (group of related orders). It is not infinite the number of trades generated by EA. It stops placing new orders when the count of them reaches MaxTrades quantity. c) FactorLot = 2; //Multiplier of previous lotsize. This is the lot size growth factor of the next order. I.e. initial lot size: 1, then next are: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. d) FactorPips = 1;//Multiplier of previous PipsStep. This is the pip loss growth factor of the next order. i.e. PipsStep = 30, the EA will place a new order each time the previous lost 30 pips. But if FactorPips = 1.5, the next order will be placed when previous lost (30x1.5) 45 pips, and the third when previous lost (30x1.5x1.5) 68 pips, and so on. It could be negative. e) OrdenSalto = 5;//Number of order to make a jump/fall (Salto) on the FactorLot. It could be negative also (fall). When EA is placing the order number OrderSalto, the lot size will make a jump or a fall. i.e. FactorLot = 2, when placing order #5 the lot size will increase in Salto (1.25): 2x1.25= 2.5 is the new lot size only for this order. The following increase lot size normally (FactorLot). OrdenSalto and Salto are never used again in the same martingale. f) Salto = 1.25;//Determine size jump on growth of the lot size. See below. g) mm=true; //If it is "true" EA manage money management as percentage of balance. If it is false the initial lot size is equal to InitialFixedLots. h) MiniAccount=true; //If EA works on a mini or standard account. i) ReverseCondition=false; //Read inverse the indicator signals. If buy, then sell and vice versa. j) risk=0.25; //Lot size of initial trade as percentage of balance. If miniaccount initial lot size is risk/10000xbalance. If standard account, initial lot size is risk/1000xbalance. k) InitialFixedLots=0.01; //Minimum lot size admitted by broker/trader. If “mm”, EA money management is false, then this is the initial lot size. If percentage over balances is less than this lot size, then initial lot size is InitialFixedLots. l) MaxLots=50;//Maximum lot size admitted by broker/trader. When the martingale needs to place an order bigger than 50, it places orders with a 50 lot size, and one with the rest. i.e. lot size = 63.5, it places one order of 50 lots, and a second of 13.5. Both are considered as one for the count of maximum trades allowed by trader on MaxTrades. (if lot size = 118.73, it places two orders of 50 lots each one and a third of 18.73, all of them are considered one trade for the count of maximum trades allowed). m) MAMethod = MODE_SMMA; //Method of Moving Average Indicator. n) MAPeriod = 100;//Period of Moving Average Indicator. o) MAPrice = MODE_OPEN; //Prices of Moving Average Indicator. p) Magic = 100108;//Number used by EA to identify orders placed by itself and manage them. If you execute the EA on two different charts, and don’t change Magic number, both EAs will manage all of the orders placed as if were the same EA. This will cause serious errors. q) slippage = 40;//Slippage for close orders. Is too big because EA closes orders using the take profit price reached by the last one as reference. How does it work on a miniaccount: - The enter signal is given by a crossing of a 100 bars smoothed moving average. If it crosses up, then signal is buy. If it crosses down, signal is sell. - If ReverseCondition is true, then the signal will be read inversed: if signal is buy, the execution is sell, and vice versa. - First order is placed with a lot size equal to risk/10000*balance. - InitialFixedLots is the initial lot size when previous step is smaller than it and when “mm” is false. - Suppose initial lot size is 0.05. If MaxTrades is 7, then this will be the sequence in the martingale: 0.05; 0.10; 0.20; 0.40; 0.80; 1.60; 3.20. EA stops placing new orders when seven orders are placed. - If OrdenSalto is set to 5, and Salto set to 1.25, then this would be the sequence: 0.05; 0.10; 0.20; 0.40; 1; 2; 4. - The take profit is place to the price equal to enter + TakeProfit in the first order. The followings are placed with a take profit equal to last enter prices plus difference between TakeProfit and PipsStep. i.e. - When prices retrace and the last order touches its take profit, all orders are closed immediately. Recommendation to test yourself: take parameters from reports uploaded, and save them on your hard disc. Improves to develop: Start and stop at a specific time if there isn’t a martingale on execution. Assure order close. The EA don’t verify if its instructions are executed properly. See next post of mine. I’m uploading the same EA with an error fixed. Testing on EUPJPY on 01/04/2007 I saw that an order was placed, and the next tick touches the take profit. It was so fast that update of order number was omitted. So the EA places again a similar order. But take profit didn’t come again, and previous orders didn’t close. Blowing up the account. Regards, Rama.

Here are bactests on EURJPY and USDCHF on big time periods (6/2004 -1/2008). Also, there is the same EA fixed. The profits aren't big. But i like them. EURJPY runs good with GBPUSD and USDCHF parameters. USDCHF runs in reverse mode. When signal is buy, then it sells and vice versa. In foward test i reduced the risk, but execute it on 5 pairs at same time, buying and selling separetely. This give on 12 days of trading (2.5 weeks) of january 20% profit. I think this is a secure way to execute the EA. Compound profits do the rest. Please, let me know how do you doing. Bye. Rama

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Rama I removed the first file MA Martingale in expert folder and I changed with the last fixed file. I did not understand anything but now it works ! Great work. Thanks

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Rama, Excellent stuff!!! This is great! I like it... Though would like to ask you a couple of questions. How are the orders placed and what time frame does the EA work on? i.e I am using a 1 hour TF. I am using 5 SMA, order is opened in the direction of the 5 SMA (if higher than previous bar and reverse option set to false) go long. then what happens? Say if TP hit, no more orders, or does it carry on? if stopped out, what does it do? thanks, guess

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I tested the system during a few hours and it works perfectly. But instead of SMA, I prefer an order launcher from hourly stochastic - if sto &gt; 80 then launching of first order (sell) ; if sto &lt; 20 then first order (buy) -others orders without change I'm not a coder but I believe that possible. What do you think about ?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Why not... but I don't forget, stochs can stay over/under sold and price will still head in that direction for a long time. hear me out on this out... we need a volatile market condition... 7am/8am GTM, that's when we see the price movement and that's when the moves start to occur and then they die down up and till midday until US open and then another surge (besides news). we have to remember

--- 帖子 #37 ---
OK, Guess we need volatility which is the best way to launch orders in volatility time ?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
thats what i think, look at 7/8am GTM time on any pair and look at the moment.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
that's right your system ( buy-sell-buy-sell ...) is different from Rama's system (buy then buy then buy the buy ...or sell then sell then sell then sell) I don't know if volatility is an important factor in Rama's system I prefer to determine a beginning of trend so I'm going to try the Rama's system during a few days...to see

--- 帖子 #40 ---
that's what I thought... we'll try that... remember, once you are into a trade and you are buying, buying and buying, then when you are going against the trend, then we are in trouble. just a thought... might need some improvements on this. what about this... we open orders in both direction and then say if it has gone x amounts in pips in one direction, then open up another order in that direction and if it moves another x amounts of pips in that direction again, open up another order in that direction again, and then close of the trade that we had running in the opposite direction, using large TP and large SL, we should be able to catch some big moves.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I think both systems are good but different if in Rama's system the entry is judicious, the third or fourth trade id good ( only 30 pips TP ) it's very rare that the market takes 100 pips without returning 30 of them

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Madscalp: thats the point. The philosophy of the strategy used by MA Martingale is that market never takes 224 pips (32 pips x7 trades) without a retrace of 30/40 pips.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I agree with stochs can stay over/under sold in a ranging market for long time. But is a good idea to test. This EA uses Martingale as money management. The stratyegy is define from line 129 to 151. If you want to try or explore another strategy just replace code of this lines. The rest will be managed as a martingale. I want to test stochastic and vegas tunnel.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
hi rama if you can explain how this ea takes orders and direction and purpose, as you have done a little, would be great. thanks, guess

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I forget to mention the better time frame is 30m. 15m is to short and get in the market too early before a retrace could happen. 1h or bigger TF have bigger movements in a single bar. This requires bigger TP and PipsSteps (lost of previous order). And too much money on balance. I think (and saw in backtest) that 30m time frame is the best one for this strategy. About volatiliy: If you run the EA and press the botton “Open Chart” of the Strategy Tester when it finish the test, you’ll see that all conditions are good, except extreme ranging markets without a single retraces of 30/40 pips. The lateralized markets around the SMA100 are the best conditions.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
MA Martingale EA uses a very simple strategy, defined between lines 129 to 151 of the expert code. For better results use parameters values shown on the reports uploaded. As you can see on the picture the EA placed six orders: - The first one was entered at 1.7662, when prices crossed down the SMA100. - But market went against this signal. - EA continued placing orders looking for a retrace (strict martingale money management). Which comes after 1.7824 price has been touched. 162 pips against your initial position. - All the orders were closed together at 1.7789 with $17,35 profit. Initial lot was 0.05, and total lot size of six orders was 3.15. - The count of pips is a loss of -485. Gess121, I could you please be more specific with your questions. I beg you perdon by my english. I'm doing my best.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Rama, it would not be better to close each trade one after the other ? suppose the first trade is lost --&gt; close of this trade at the beginning of the second if the second is lost --&gt; close of this trade at the beginning of the third if the third is lost--&gt; close at the beginnig of the fourth......... it seems better for money management when there is more than three trades is it possible to modify that in the code ? what do you think about ? PS english is not either my native language what country are you from ?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Madscalp, how r u doing? In this case, if the TP is larger than number of Pips to double the lot, this isn´t a good idea. Better stay with the orders open. When comes a retrace it will recover the pips os PipsStep. I don´t try it yet with TP smaller than Pips-Step. Ps: What is this "Slope ** .mq4 " ?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thank you for your explanation. Slope Line is an indicator of trend. I asked Rama to try this indicator for order launching. In 7 tests, the indicator of the EA gave five times a bad direction. Finally, it is not very important but I prefer another indicator by safety. This one is excellent in 30 mn chart.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Guess, Numeral is right. Retrace recover the floating pips loss. But your idea has an advantage from original: it free margin. And margin is critical when placing order 7, 8, 9 or higher of martingale. Of course this has worst statistical results, as you can see on attached reports. Realized lost is bigger than the original. This is coded on original EA on lines 224 to 230 for buy only. The EA works with the last two orders, closing all the previous, one by one when last is opened. i.e.: when placing order 3, it closes order 1, not 2. That’s because the retrace will recover, and put in profit, the last two orders opened. I’m attaching EA for both, buy and sell, on next post. Rama

--- 帖子 #51 ---
As you can see I was working this weekend. Replaced the SMA(100) indicator by Slope indicator, as MadScalp suggested. It has better performance than “MA Martingale”. But still make wrong enters. It also makes too many trades. And need to reduce initial lot size, and a higher maximum trade number (MaxTrades = 9 for all pairs tested GBPUSD, USDCHF, EURUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY). To reduce these problems I added a MACD indicator, to confirm if trend is up or down. Then I realized that MACD is best indicator than Slope. So change the order of them: first read MACD, then confirm with Slope. Lateralized markets make wrong signals. So put a range on MACD between 0.00005 and -0.0005 considering lateralized, to avoid enter new order. Please don’t forget: - All indicators are sluggish, slowed down. They give the signals too late to enter the market. - Martingale is a money management system, not a trading one. Two new parameters There are two new parameters added to EA: 1. ClosePrevOrder = true/false. This enables or disables closing previous orders when a new one is opened, as mentioned on post #50. EA keeps working with last two opened orders only. 2. StopTrading = true/false. This enables or disables enter new orders with a new signal. If a martingale is open, it continues managing it, but, when it gets closed, EA don’t start new ones. The basic idea is the same as suggested in this thread with date and hour. But I didn’t have time to code this better stoptrading. See and compare reports on GBPUSD. One of them close first trades when third one is open. The other keeps all orders open until last one touch its take profit, same as original idea. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #52 ---
hi rama, yes, i liked the results that you have with the original system. there are several approaches to this system and i think it depends on what you want, everyone wants something different. if we were to keep it simple, then i think it would be best, and as long as it makes pips... i am happy. Be it 10 pips a day. regards, guess

--- 帖子 #53 ---
The system don't change: it's only the way of entry which varies. It's a big factor to avoid too many trades. Like Guess says it, it's true that each one wants its own entry. Another solution: we choose our own entry and the size of the lots and the EA works for us with these characteristics. It's a semi-automatic way to proceed. Rama , the new EA' icon is grey and doesn't work ! ( I'm unlucky ) I'd like also you look at this thread about Pascal's triangle. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=62066 especially #12 and #25 It's a different system but very interesting. Do you think that it is possible to make an EA from this theory ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I forget a change done on AllOrdersControl.mq4. Here is uploaded new one. I'm going to take a look... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=62066 Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Good Job! Amazing, it only reached 9 open orders 2 times in 4 years!! The both tests!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Rama What timeframe you advise with MACD Martingale use ? It seems 15 mn the best, right ?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
hi rama, this is great. say if i wanted to disable some of the functions, i.e say if i don't want to use the following: c) PipsStep=25; //Fixed pip loss until a new order is entered in the same way. If the previous order lost a number of pips equal to PipsStep, it enters a new one following martingale parameters. d) FactorPips = 1;//Multiplier of previous PipsStep. This is the pip loss growth factor of the next order. i.e. PipsStep = 30, the EA will place a new order each time the previous lost 30 pips. But if FactorPips = 1.5, the next order will be placed when previous lost (30x1.5) 45 pips, and the third when previous lost (30x1.5x1.5) 68 pips, and so on. It could be negative. e) OrdenSalto = 5;//Number of order to make a jump/fall (Salto) on the FactorLot. It could be negative also (fall). When EA is placing the order number OrderSalto, the lot size will make a jump or a fall. i.e. FactorLot = 2, when placing order #5 the lot size will increase in Salto (1.25): 2x1.25= 2.5 is the new lot size only for this order. The following increase lot size normally (FactorLot). OrdenSalto and Salto are never used again in the same martingale. f) Salto = 1.25;//Determine size jump on growth of the lot size. See below. how would i be able to do this? thanks, guess

--- 帖子 #58 ---
As lot size is determine with this formula = (Previous or InitialLotSize) x FactorPips x Salto, just put value 0 (cero) to FactorPips. And the EA never place a second order. If you only want to disable Salto, put value 1 (one). It doesn't matter OrdenSalto value. Be carefull, the EA don't use stop loss. Rama

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Rama Congratulations for your work. Just a question to get the Holy Grail http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Can you make a manual entry option (MEO) in the EA ? Thus, we can choose the entry ( buy or sell ) and then the EA works alone. Best regards.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Madscalp, what u want don´t need be inside the EA. When you move the Expert to the chart, you can choose what you allow: - Only Long - Only Sell - Long and Sell Regards,

--- 帖子 #61 ---
hi rama, that's great... i will give this a go... could you also code the time that we want to trade to open and all trades to be closed, that would be great. thanks, guess

--- 帖子 #62 ---
hi rama, also about this EA, i was just going through a couple of things, can you confirm this, as i don't think this ea does it and was wondering if you could code this. if i open an order in one direction, when i hit stop loss, will it open an order in the opposite direction? when that stop loss is hit, will it then open the order in the opposite direction, etc. thanks, guess

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi guess, I'm developing an EA, and testing it on a real account since today, that manages orders entered manually. This means you force a trade and then the EA applies martingale money management following the method we are talking about on this thread. I suppose it will be finished this weekend. There will be other improvements on EA (better close all orders, etc.). What I don't like of the EA is that there is too many parameters. This gives flexibility, but you must be very carefull with the settings. I suggest and use to save each pair setting on experts\presets folder. Regards, Rama

--- 帖子 #64 ---
This EA doesn't work like that. It doesn't use stop loss nor reverse orders. EA opens orders when prices crosses Smoothed MA 100. If price goes against your position, it places another similar order with lot size doubled. I follows an strict martingale money management. Martingale don't reverse position. If you are betting black, you don't change the colour and double your bet. You just keep betting black and doubling your bet. I read about your idea on forexfactory, but i didn't explore it yet. There is an EA also. Just search it. To avoid a margin call use micro lots. On backtests EA isn't very profitable: 40% to 80% per year, with 10% to 60% max draw down. But it works for me. I'm appling it on 5 pairs with micro lots. I expect a 20% profit on each one, looking for an annual profit target of 100% with no more than 5% draw down. Regards, Rama

It's exactly what I wanted. Thus we can get the possibility to enter a trade manually from a own signal and after the EA works normally with its own settings. You are the best, Rama. You can call this EA the Super Rama EA http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

Hello Rama, So, how was the Real acc? And what version r u using? I´m testing the original MA v2.1 with good results. R u using the same setings: TakeProfit=34; PipsStep=32; MaxTrades=8; FactorLot=2.05.? Regards,

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I started trading this on real acc. on 02/06/2008. So it's too early to say good or bad. Until 02/15/2008 account balance (and equity) was 2.8%. No floating P/L. Forecast of this 2.8% in 9 days shows a 113% annual. This is may target. About setings, yes I'm using the same. Regards. Rama

Hi guys, This weekend I was testing original Bagovino's trading method: 5 ema crossing 12 ema, and rsi 21 above or below 50. Results aren't good enough on back tests. I think this method is excellent on manual trading, because you can confirm enter signals visually. All the algorithms of crossing indicators are difficult to code, and always give wrong signals. I read an article on www.mql4.com/554 that says - in other words - this is the real challenge on coding EAs. But looking at charts I realized and confirmed that 100 smoothed moving average rules price. On every blown up of account on back test of Original Bagovino’s Method, the reason was the same: order was entered too far from SMA 100 against the main trend. Attached is the Original Bagovino's Method EA. It’s yours. Test it at your own taste and risk. This returned me to the SMA 100, which is the base of the MA Martingale v2.x (all versions). What I was trying to see on charts was the path of prices. The top and bottom lines drawing left and right borders of prices highway, continuously moving forward, up or down. It was so simple like add four levels on SMA100 indicator on GBPUSD pair: 120, 60, -60 and -120. This gave me the image I was looking for. And an idea to improve MA Martingale v2.1 profits. So I developed and added a new enter signal that gives the results showed on reports attached. They are really amazing. As the hard work is done thanks to MA Martingale v2.2, I’m working now on a PDF file to document all parameters, with good explanations and complete examples. I think this could be the start of a new thread because it’s very different from Bagovino’s method. Be patient. I’m also uploading now the MA Martingale v2.2 with manual trading option, restart problems fixed, and some more, but I didn’t finish forward testing it. Be careful on real accounts. You only need to put number 0 or 1 on ForceOrderType, and in the next tick the order is entered. With the first order entered, return ForceOrderType to 6 immediately. This is not the idea I have on a Manual Trading EA. I’m working on one with the six alternatives: BUY, SELL, (B &amp; S) LIMIT AND (B &amp; S) STOP, with no indicators. More patient, and good trades. Regards. Rama

Great work, Rama We are waiting for explanations because there are many new parameters. Regards

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thanks Rama. You r making a fantastic work. This idea is great. I´m also looking for this Daily Stoch Sytem, http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=69151 and trying to see how make it better with martingale. One thing i know. This is the right path! Regards

--- 帖子 #71 ---
You are right, Numeral It's also an interesting thread.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I'm afraid there is a problem with v2.2. No trade for 12 hours on three pairs! With ForceOrderTrade, it's the same thing since with option 1 or option 2, there is nothing which starts. I don't understand. Maybe a setting problem ?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi madscalp, If you don’t see a smiley face on the top right corner of the chart you must allow expert trading. Press F7 and mark case “Allow live trading” on common page. Be sure you copied new files AllOrdersContro.mq4 and info.mq4 to c:\program files\metatrader4\experts\include folder. EA parameter “StopTrading” must be set to false. And finally allow experts execution by pressing central bottom of tool bar, beside MetaEditor bottom. It must change a red stop simbol to a green play one. You must see on the top left corner of chart, below market data (pair, open, high, low, and close) five row with this text: Ordenes Abiertas: 0 Secuencia 1 de 9 Last Lot Size: 0 Account Balance: #### Account Equity: #### Free Margin: #### See chart attached. If it doesn’t work there is another problem. Good luck. Rama

Numeral: I have a few problems with this deal: 1. It is too much work start studing a new system now. I'm open to new ideas, and also search and reading what ever i find, but in the same row of thought. Now is too much work for me. I prefer to concentrate efforts on the SMA 100 method. 2. I want to finish MA Martingale 3 as last version of this system. If you can have a strong EA. This will free time to study a new one. 3. I have a serious problem with stoch, I don't undestand it. I don't know how to read it. I read theory, but I find it hard to code. It uses close price, and this make permanent changes on indicator. Very difficult to code. If you could be more specific on what are proposing about Stoch to add MA Martingale, it will be helpfull. Thanks for the links, they are very intresting. I hope I could spend more time to analyze them. Regards. Rama

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Madscalp: You were wright, there is a mistake on version 2.2 Here is EA again with problem fixed. I typed twice return(0) on init() function of the EA. This make it start and exit immediatly. Sorry by the error. This happened because i didn't test it enough. That's the reason i'm going to take all the week to test version 3. Then you can help making your own tests. Thanks you for the advice. Regards. Rama

Rama, you r right! We need Keep It Simple. "MA Martingale" it´s becoming a great EA (its already very good). And tt´s good concentrate injust few things, to do the best possible.

Hi, thanks for this interesting idea and thread. I get an error info.mq4 not found. I searched the web for it and found one version, but i think its not the same as the one u use. When placed in the include folder, i still get 3 other errors. I dont have any errors with allorderscontrol So, please post here your version of info.mq4 which i suppose needs to be placed in the include folder for this EA to function thanks

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Rama, I'd just like to get an explanation about Force Open Trade. If the choice is 1 (buy) , the EA buys immediately. Right ? If it's 2 (sell), it sells. Because these two options don't work even with the new version.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Efex, this file was posted yesterday.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Madscalp, it´s working fine here. I test with 3 diferents pairs.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I'm confused. When you enter 1, the EA buys immediately ?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi: Description on ForceOrderType_desc="Force open trade. 1-Buy/ 2-Sell /6-None" is wrong. It must say 0-Buy/ 1-Sell. when you set this parameter, it enters the order at first tick. Rama

--- 帖子 #83 ---
efextrader: The info.mq4 is in the MA Martingale v2.2.zip, with all the other. The zip is a complete package. It also have presets for different pairs. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #84 ---
You are a joker, Rama http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif with your wrong description ! It works now. Is needed to change magic number for each pair ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Change Magic number on each chart. It doesn't matter if you use two charts on the same pair. Use different Magic Number on each chart. If you don't do that orders will mix. Rama

--- 帖子 #86 ---
The EA v 2.2 is working nicely with profits. I like a lot the possibility of manual entry. Can you use the Numeral's code about stoch ( #76) to make another possibility to enter a trade ? Because an entry in a oversold/overbought area in TF 60 can reduce significantly the number of trades and make a safer system. Indeed a number too important of trades makes waste time and causes stress by increasing of the size of lots. Thanks, Rama.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Example of EURJPY Feb 20 In automatic, at 3:47 (GMT+1), the system gives a BUY order 0.23 at 159,20 (higher for several days ???). Then, the prices decrease: another BUY 0.46 at 158,95 another BUY 0.92 at 158,70 another BUY 1.84 at 158,42 another BUY 3.68 at 158,15 STRESS is increasing ( happily it's a demo account!) Finally, the fifth trade is winner at 10:34 . Just an observation: at 3:47, the Stoch 1 hour was overbought ( &gt; 90) and with a stoch entry, normally the order was SELL and no BUY. It was a winner trade without lost time and without stress. I did not understand why the system has bought at highest for several days. Excuse me, Rama, but I don't think that entry system is the must. The stoch entry is a possibility but I thought also at MACD. I attached two 30 mn chart with MACD (12.26.20) - note the high value of signal. The crossing between main line and signal could give an entry. I know it's many work for you, Rama, but we are trying to make a good EA.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Another example today with the same pair: the EA needed 5 trades the first EA trade was on an incorrect level with MACD 12.26.20 enter Buy --&gt; only 1 trade enter Sell --&gt; 1 trade maybe 2

--- 帖子 #89 ---
LOL, i like this "Stress is increasing" .. It´s a good point of view. I have 2 cents; ... i think it´s a good place to sell in this new high... the probability to falling down is bigger lol. Like true happen. A stoch is welcome, to trade in the trend, can highly the profits with more winners trades and less wrong direction. Also can put a reverse condition, like Rama use. To increase the trades and lots. My EA here was in the 3rd Sell order at EUR/JPY when you start your first Sell at 159,20. And close all when 158,80. Not bad. Ps: i can´t see your attacheds.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi Numeral, I'm using now MAMethod 3 and MAPeriod 40: it's better. I think MAPeriod 100 is too big. What settings do you use ? Do you use stochastic to entry ?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Yes i'm using MAPeriod 100 It´s big.. but can handle with it with more pairs. &gt; Do you use stochastic to entry ? In this system, no. but i use in others, have better entrys. Can be a good confirmation, or a entry option.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi guys: I think you are using too risky parameters on a currency pair with very high volatility. During a some time system will show good profits, but on back tests it says this way of trading is letal, specially on news or event days. An MA of 40 is suicide. Madscalp, are you using ReverseCondition (and taking your medicine)? About stoch, i'm going to incorporate it, and all other indicators that help improve profits, reduce drawdown, etc. But not now. I'm running the EA live. And today it misses an order at 108.25 of USDJPY. I really don't know why, but it happen. If it had entered, now it would be near it close level. That's the kind of bugs i need to solve before continue adding new code. I mean code that increases version number. I save a copy of Numeral code for future reference. I have to go now. Bye. Rama

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Great Rama, About this kind of bugs.. here we go: i don´t know if it is a bug or not, but, eur/cad, gbp/usd, don´t open a trade since i start 2008.02.19 00:15. Version 2.1 have more bugs (i think you already fix it) With MaxTrades:7, CHF/JPY and EUR/CHF - Just open 2 orders. Happened more than 4 days/times. and NZD/JPY -with MaxTrades: 7, just open 3 orders, happened 3 days Also happened only once with USD/JPY, USD/CHF. Rama, have anything i could do for help you with this great system?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi Rama My health is better http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif I'm trying different settings about TP , Pipsteps and MAPeriod with only three pairs EURUDS, USDJPY and EURJPY. I hope to reduce the risk by decreasing TP and PS. What do you think about MACD 12.26.20 like entry ? Did you see the graphs ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi guys, Here is again MA Martingale v2.21.mq4 with some bugs fixed. This morning i found my trade terminal with some lots that didn't entered. And it starts to get dangerous. Afortunately, i could manage them manually, with stress like madscalp. Now i have to take same medicine to continue trading. Thanks god i found the problem. There is another variable missed or lost when EA restars = myOrderType. Used to identify what kind of order it must be placed: buy or sell. So i recoded the EA making it static, and giving trader the option to set it manually. I'm still working on version 3. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Madscalp. Be carefull with EURUSD. It don't use to retraces as USDJPY and GBPUSD do. I recommend both last mentioned. In large period backtest, EURUSD shows long ranging trends, without a retraces bigger than 26/29 pips. I downloaded data from Alpari since 06/15/2004 in 1 minute for these tests. Better pairs, by its own kind of retrace and market range, are: GBPUSD, USDJPY, CHFJPY, EURJPY. Suicide are GBPJPY, EURUSD. The rest i don't like because they have a big spreads . Ten pips of spread is too much for a scalper. Regards. Rama

--- 帖子 #97 ---
The number of trades depends on what kind of moving average you use, and the characteristic of the pair traded. Most active pairs are GBPUSD, USDJPY and USDCHF. If you run EA on USDCAD it will be borring, and with the first martingale it blows your account if it entered on the opposite side. This pair moves in the same trend for long time without retraces. It doesn't give you any chance to quit the market. Rama

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Rama, where r u from? Sorry for my english; Whats i mean, is they need 15 pips to do other buy/sell at pipstep, but the pairs goes more than 40, 50 and don´t open the 3rd or others pipstep orders. About the pairs, i like to test in all of them.. maybe it is risky but we always learn something. Change the tp and pipstep, maybe is a solution to make them profitable. And, i have to congratulation you, the EA handle/work very well today with the big movements in all pairs. Again thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Martingale can work but you need to put the market a little bit in your favour first. This is how it done. Basically trade weekly and we exploit the fact that most weeks go somewhere but we dont know which way and profitable systems do NOT guess. First take euro for example and use black scholes options pricing based on the current volatility to give you some idea of next friday targets on a sunday night. Implied Volatility (IV) is 10.12% this week so that gives euro targets on friday 3.00 pm London time of 14850 OR 14550 rounded it to the nearest 50 pip increment which are touch targets for option players. If you dont know then google how to price options i dont have the space or time to explain here how this works but this was priced last sunday not when i wrote this as euro was at 14837 a few hours ago so 14850 is looking very good. This is a deviation of about 150 pips for the week starting from the CLOSE of last friday night i have 1.4681 for this week. Now take the 150 pips expected target and divide by 5 days = 30 pips so this is my breakout price for the week. 1.4681 + 30 = 14711 and down side breakout = 14651. So to recap i have 2 breakout prices 30 pips above and below friday close thus 14651 and 14711. Now you can see we know the targets and we have a breakout range which gives us about 100 pips potential for this week after breakout. Now simply go short below the low price and long above. The opposite price becomes STOP REVERSE and DOUBLE up. Dont even think about indicators or trailing stops or any such thing it dont work. It just so happens this week has been a real pig for this system but the prior 11 weeks have departed a breakout price and virtually gone direct to target every week. This week required 4 trades so 1 2 4 8 times up on lots now and hopefully will see 14850 tomorrow about 3 oclock. Becuase the martingale is required sometimes you must make sure that the 1st trade is very small so that by the time you get to trade 4 or 5 you are still in your comfort zone. I think this week is about as bad as it ever gets so lets see a system at its worst rather then its best so if you don't get underway on the 4th trade then walk away. Now this is vital. If the target price is met after midnight Wednesday you MUST tp and close for the week. We have already established by Black Scholes that excess of 14850 this week is really pushing your luck so exit. But if the target price is seen BEFORE Wednesday midnight then you attempt to take a reverse trade back towards the weekly open price. Always use the same stop as priced for this week so try once with a 30 stop. This is a very nice bonus trade if it works. Let the price spill over we are not concerned with spillage we are already out of the market and be sure its coming back before attempting a reversal this can take hours after an early target has been reached. In these cases the price is oversold over bought and there has been 3 weeks recently that achieved a 150/200 dip or push by as early as Tuesday morning then reversed perfectly for another 150/200 pips! On these early reversal weeks use discretion where you exit the weekly open price is often seen again. Finally if targets are not met within 30 minutes of your broker closing on friday then exit regardless of profits or not and next week is a new week. IV and price targets must be calculated every week. Every week is different and every pair is different but by using the weekly market direction we have the market to assist us most of the time. Second by trading this over the week it prevents over trading and easier to manage manually using SMS alerts on MT4. The martingale trading gives as more chance to reach a breakout and still maintain a profit target. Without martingale this 4 trade week would be a losing week with no chance of recovery. On better weeks martingale is rarely used once or twice a week is the norm. Ed to see the risks involved. 1st trade lost 60 pips at 1 lot = -60 2nd trade lost 60 at 2 lots = -120 3rd trade lost 60 at 4 lots = -240 total losses so far -420 Trade 4 is long from 14711 with 8 lots on board. If it makes the target of 14850 thats 139 times 8 lots = 1112 pips profit minus losses = +692. However if it loses again this week is catastrophic so trade tiny microlots

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I was thinking, maybe this occur when the eletricity falls(off) this happen one day ago. And when i start the computer, the EA don´t recognize that price to open a new order, and keep it with only that incompleted martingale.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Writing an EA that reestablishes multiple positions after a shut down is not easy. Second you will never cover the spreads trying to do this on intraday. If you trade my weekly version you will trade less and make more money and its not fussy if your lights go out for a few hours so long as you can keep entering the 2 breakout prices with TP's thats all your need.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Thanks for making share your observations about better pairs. I'm using now the following settings: TP 15, Pipstep 12 and FactorLot 2,2 . I kept MAPeriod 100 since you say less is suicide ! There are many trades but it's safe for me : a retracement of 15-18 pips is enough to get profits. We are waiting for your v.3.00 and we are patient. Thank you very very much for your excellent work, Rama.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi Bolt, good to have a celebrity here! Its hard to find someone with 8 years in forex. Great topic, i´m trying to understand more. How long do you use this system? You told.. 11 weeks (or was backtested)? i´m looking for Black-Scholes and how to price option; Implied Volatility (IV); i find a lot of sites, but all i read only make me fell more confuse. Have you already saw any EA about this kind of system?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Guys: Please pay attention to these restarting parameters. While a computer shut down or MetaTrader Terminal close and restart, you must follow this procedure if you have a martingale running (opened orders by EA): 1. You don't need do anything on charts you don't have open trades. 2. If you are installing a new version, close first your MT4 Terminal, copy ea.mq4 file on ...\experts folder. 3. Restart MT4 Terminal. This will recover parameters used on each chart on new version. 4. At the top left corner you have information used by EA. Opened Orders and PreviousOpenOrders must be equal. 5. LastLotSize must be equal to your last trade opened. And NextLotSize must indicate the size of the next. 6. "No Type Order" means EA don't have identify what kind of order must be placed: buy or sell. So if you have a martingale running this text indicates the next order won't be opened. To fix this you need inform EA the values of the lost parameters. 7. Complete the last 4 parameters to inform EA those values: NewLastLotSize, NewMaxTradesAux, NewPreviousOpenOrders and NewMyOrderType. 8. Change UpdateVar from false to true. Accept change on EA. This will update the loosen parameters values at the first tick. You'll see on top left corner the restored values. Specially next enter price. This means EA knows what kind and enter price of next order. 9. Once all values were restored, return UpDateVar to false. DON FORGET THIS PLEASE. With improves of MA Martingale v2.21 this procedure is not necessary. EA do it automatically. But you have the chance to do it manually if, for example, you change your computer. The repair is automatic, but you still have a tool box. I use to trade at office computer during day. At night i trade (watch) at home, while keep running office machine, as main terminal. So i need to say EA running at home what does office EA is doing. You can control your trading account from two different computers at the same time. Regards Rama

Just an update to let you know my trade to tp 14850 is done and all closed for the week. Its nice knowing the system worked again in one of the worst weeks in a long time. " Great topic, i´m trying to understand more. How long do you use this system? You told.. 11 weeks (or was backtested)? i´m looking for Black-Scholes and how to price option; Implied Volatility (IV); i find a lot of sites, but all i read only make me fell more confuse. Have you already saw any EA about this kind of system?" I have used variants of the weekly system for years but it gets tweaked along the way to adjust to current market conditions and when i see something that is worth using. The market changes about every 6 months to something quite different. Before oct 2006 many scalper EA's and short term reversal systems like contest winner Pheonix worked a treat for many years. Since Oct 2006 most of these EA's stopped working or require part time use with great discretion. I did backtest a simple weekly system couple of years back but the IV was not IV but historical based on ATR. Also early target and reversal not in backtest which i know greatly improves the system yet the backtest at least showed a paper profit. Because everything is setup on a sunday it really not required to use an EA. Using the MT4 alerts is more then enough to let you know that a stop or tp is hit and more then 3 trades a week is very rare.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Have any thread here in FF about this system? I read some websites but i don´t know how to find the IV, and calculate the TP. You think this method can be improved ?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I have also these "label". You shut down MT4 and starts again: "label" disappears. We must ask Rama to know why.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Today with EURJPY 5 M TP 15 and PipStep 12 EA gives BUY 159.06 ... OK Prices decrease more 80 pips but no more trades ??? Normally, next BUY was at 158.91--&gt; nothing and others buy orders either. I was not at home and finally I finished manually. Magic number different for each pair and the other pairs worked fine in the same time.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
They are labels not used. I'm going to clean them on next code review. It's just an stetic problem. You can delete them manually by pressing right bottom mouse and selecting "Objetct list".

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Did you change MA Martingale v2.2 to last one posted yesterday? I don't see on top left corner the information EA use to show. There is a text saying "No Type Order" if expert don't know what to do, or the next enter price. Copy the file to experts folder, and compile EA before launch MT4 terminal, if your version don't do it automatically each time you execute it. Review this steps and tell me please. Rama.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Numeral, Could you please post some pictures showing how does it work. If i understand it, with the code provided, i think it will be a great system. Thanks. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanks, Rama It's the last version 2.21 I'm going to check now the text "No type Order" and others displays on the left corner for next time. I attached two screenshots of 1 H chart with different stoch 6.3.3 -7.3.3 -8.3.3 etc.. and MACD 12.26.12. You'll note that the "pikes" of stoch in the overbought/oversold areas are excellent entries but I prefer the crossing of MACD signal with its main line to enter a trade. Maybe you can now begin a new thread because it is not any more the Baggio method. Excellent weekend for you.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I don´t know if this will work.. but using Stoch as Filter or for Close wrong entrys - after a while don´t close in profit. Maybe with RSI, the martingale works better. I will try to make a visual backtest. Attached is a Sotch EA. Rama, what do u think can be improved in your EA? The entrys? Any risk Protection ?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi Numeral, How your EA works ? With MA Martingale ? About Stoch, I think it's better with bigger TF ( 1 H and more) 15 mn is too small It's true the number of trades is a real problem. I saw on your chart the first entry with 6 trades !!!! It's too much. Of course, the profit is increasing but it's dangerous. When we reduce the number of trades to 3 or 4 maxi, we will have made a real progress for the safety of the system. We must look for a better entry: Stoch or MACD in my opinion at 1 H or 4 H TF.

I attached the same chart but in 1 H. You can see at time of your first entry stoch is &lt; 80 ---&gt; no entry. The crossing signal-main line MACD (yellow arrow) --&gt; entry but BUY Excuse me: I saw your EA attached on your chart: it's a MAM with stoch entry. Regards.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
This first trade with 6 trades, was a good one.. the stoch was overbought, and one time u know the prices will fall. It keeping up and open more orders to make more profit. I look for more possible trades for each pair (at max of 6 and rarely 7) and more profitable trades. More than 7 start to beginning dangerous. True, H1 will be less risk, and less oportunities.. maybe M30. This EA works only with Stoch entrys, the filters; Times for trade, account % money protection.

The FX market also offers one unique advantage that makes it more attractive for traders who have the capital to follow the martingale strategy. The ability to earn interest allows traders to offset a portion of their losses with interest income. This means that an astute martingale trader may want to only trade the strategy on currency pairs in the direction of positive carry . part of a post from By Kathy Lien , Chief Strategist, FXCM I read this and was thinking maybe its a good solution to create a martingale for long time trades, always on the right side of interest rates.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Ah ....OK If I understood, you look for a wrong way to increase your profit.... We don't look for the same thing. If you find a good entry for you, I would choose the reversecondition for me http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi guys, I back tested better entry combining stoch and macd, on 30m, 1h and 4h, only EURUSD. Results are good, but always appears a wrong signal. I mean, indicators says long, price moves in that direction, but suddenly it changes and blow the account. This happen particularly on no ranging days. Lateralized ones. I think both indicators are excellent for manual trading. For an EA a trade singal could happen when indicator signal crosses main line by only 0.00001. If you watch the chart and trade manually, this signal would be omitted. Here is the same expert that trades MACD and STOCH, when MACD is grater than 0.0005. This value is to avoid enter after a few days without important movements. Test it, and tell me if you found a setting for it. It doesn work for me.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Last year i developed this EA to test the idea. It isn't a exactly a martingale. Swap could do the difference. Check this experiment. The expert tests the following idea: What happen if you enter an order on the positive swap side, when price goes down its EMA. It enter an order each 8 hours. See report. It is really amazing. But I never will trade like this. It’s just an experiment with initial balance of USD 300 on GBPJPY. Rama

Hello guys... Sorry you guys are doing a great job on this thread, I've been lerking about when I have had the chance and reading FF, been busy with other commitments at home, but now I am free!!! Rama, you're a genius! Thanks very much for your hard work on thread, Numeral, Madscalp... great input as well! Madscalp, you watch the Rugby tonight The little time I spent looking at charts and thinking, hmm I need something simple... not too complexed, I would be happy with 10-15pips a day! So we are looking to catch a trend and make these pips and all over the charts you can see where this can be done, as they say hindsigt is great! It cannot be more simpler than this (I don't think ... I like simple) and this will work - I think, in all market conditions... feel free to comment! Rules: Any pair TF - 1 hour Trading times 7am GTM to 17:00 GTM TP - 10 pips (exluding spread) SL - 10 pips ( including spread) Entry Example: 1. (I need some help on the entry) Based on the 6am GTM candle on Friday 22nd February we have a bull candle, so when the 7am candle opens we go long. Zoom down to 5min chart and see start of chart, we end up getting stopped out. 2. Start of 8am candle we go long, again we get stopped out. 3. Start of 9am candle we go short, again we get stopped out. 4. Start of 10am candle we got long and bang... TP of 10 pips. Though I think 15pips TL/SL will do be better! Regards, Guess

Hi Rama Just a question:the aim of the method after an entry is to carry out less possible trades ? or no Since Numeral's message, I'm dubitative. In any case, Rama, you provided us a fantastic tool : we can choose target profit, pipstep,factorlot and more...We can also entry manually. If, in the time, there is no bug, it will be an excellent system. About the automatic entry, it's at the choice : there are many possibilities and reversecondition. Since a few days, I'm using small parameters TP :15 , PS : 12 and FactorLot : 2.2 with success. On Feb 20, I opened a new demo account with $ 3 000 and today it's $ 3 455.56 ! Next year, I'll buy Microsoft, Google and more .... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif I had just a problem with a trade which did not work ( a first buy entry then nothing....) and I'll avoid now the too volatile pairs according to your opinion: there can be a big variation (100 pips and more) without a significative retracement. I'll try your new version next week. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Interesting but it's totally different.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Rama, There is a problem with MACD Stoch v 3.0. The icon is grey and the EA don't open. A couple of questions about : Is there the possibility in the EA to use only MACD or only Stoch or both work together ? Secondly, yours signal entries work with a determined timeframe or in according to the used graph ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
The grey icon means you have different versions on “#include” files. Here are the latest versions of them. Replace your existing AllOrdersControl and Info mq4 files from your \expert\include folder. I fixed the labels problem. Answer of your first question, is yes. Here you are the EA with enable/disable MACD or STOCH. Don’t disable both of them at same time. EA won’t place any order. I tested it on EURUSD on 1h time frame only. I really don’t like this kind of indicators, because they lie, they are lazy. They show you what happened after it happened. Stoch moves up and down continuously on low volatility days. Giving wrong signals. During current bar, with close price indicators, a signal could disappear at the next bar, because price change too much. Test the EA on Visual Mode, with Data Window opened. Run it slowly on a wrong signal, and pause it at the moment it appears. The values will be ok. But at the end of the bar, indicators values will change, disappearing the given signal. I fix to the SMMA system. I test EURUSD on 1h time frame with excellent results. There are more retracements on that time frame for this pair. Same as USDCHF. Good luck Rama

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Rama, It's OK now. When you say "a signal is wrong", how many trades are necessarry ? If it's less four trades, it's good. If Stoch or MACD gave good signals every time, we should not need Martingale : one trade only would be winner. I think MACD and Stoch 1 Hour give safe entries for 3 or 4 trades maxi. For you, SMMA system is the best ( v 2.2) with EURUSD and USDCHF. Could you give us exactly your SMMA settings which give you excellent results ? I'll test MACD STOCH 3.00 very soon. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
It is necessary 8+ trades to solve a wrong entry. In fact, I couldn’t find at least one setting for the period jun-2004 feb-2008 on EURUSD. Run the EA on back test, and you’ll find paradigmatic signals, perfect values of the indicators, which ends blowing your balance. Code a signal combination of MACD &amp; Stoch is really complex. These indicators are excellent tools for manual trading. On back tests automatic moving average trading shows better results. Attached is a comparison of both systems. The number of trades affects profits. Just another opinion from a trader that only has lost money until today . Rama

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Rama, &gt; 7. Complete the last 4 parameters to inform EA those values: NewLastLotSize, NewMaxTradesAux, NewPreviousOpenOrders and NewMyOrderType. 8. Change UpdateVar from false to true. Accept change on EA. This will update the loosen parameters values at the first tick. You'll see on top left corner the restored values. Specially next enter price. This means EA knows what kind and enter price of next order. 9. Once all values were restored, return UpDateVar to false. DON FORGET THIS PLEASE. With improves of MA Martingale v2.21 this procedure is not necessary. EA do it automatically. But you have the chance to do it manually if, for example, you change your computer. &lt; I try to use it, but useless. Maybe i´m doing something wrong. Observation: this is the version 2.21 (but shows 2.1 because i rename-it to update without change the settings) This EUR/CHF open only 2 trades and after the last weekend (closed and re-open) it don´t open more trades. I try to just put "UpdateVar: True" and doesnt work. and i try to put the settings: NewLastLotSize: 0,36 and 0,28 NewMaxTradesAux: 4 NewPreviousOpenOrders: 2 NewMyOrderType: i try 6 and 1 The message was that: Margin insuficient to next order. - But i have a LOT of margin. The account start with $5000 and have balance $6650 and Eqiuty: 6000 Thanks,

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Thanks for your effort Rama. I will try a forward test. (i don´t like backtest, they lie too much, some test are profitable, and don´t make profit at real, and other aren´t and make good money. ) I have 90% modeling but i will try forward that systems at least 1 month with different settings. Yes. Maybe it´s true.. Stock and Macd aren´t the best one. The research never stops.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I come back about SMMA system. What do you mean by "I fix to the SMMA system" ? What are your settings which allow "excellent results" ? We concentrate ourselves on MACD and Stoch and finally maybe is SMMA the best and simplest method to entry a trade ? Regards

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Maybe yes. Today i saw one guy seeling a Martingale EA with MA Cross. Here it is: How does EATangga work:- 1. EATangga will detect the current trend (MA42;16 default setting) 2. EATangga will open position either BUY or SELL when eatangga detect current trend 3. EATangga assume that all market going well,so eatangga open 1st position with 0.1 lot 4. If position 0.1 floating -3pips, EATangga will open 0.2 lot to support 5. If market going very well, EATangga only open position 0.1 lot and Trailing stop will apply to make profit as possible 6. If trend change, EATangga will close all position and open another position with same current trend 7. after close position, EATangga wait until next cross moving average to open position 8. Why EATangga does not open another position after close? It because, in future we don't know what will happen, so eatangga will not take that risk 9. By changing MA 42;16 to MA 15;5, EATangga will open trade more often than default because MA 15;5 will cross over more often than MA 42;16 That is basically EATangga work I will attach the ex4, only for study, it works for only a few days. Very dangerous sell this kind of ea, it´s not a good way of make money.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Finally, what's your opinion, Numeral ? All martingales are dangerous and lethal ? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif

--- 帖子 #135 ---
No, i think martingale it is a great way to make money in forex. But trade a $3.000 account with 0.10 lot, it´s crazy. with 6 levels; at max 3.20 lots; 300 pips in one day, and your account can go to - $960, or 32% drawdown. I look for 10% month profits, max of safe 20%, maybe anythink far away from this is crazy. What´s your opinion?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
There is something wrong on the values set. If previous opened orders are 2, why do you have 4 additional orders? MaxTradesAux is a variable used to identify how many orders are necessary when a martingale needs a lot bigger than MaxLots. It will divide it in two or more, if it is necessary. For example, with a lot size of 66.5, EA will open two orders: one with 16.5 lots and a second with 50 lots (if MaxLots = 50). In this situation, EA has 2 opened orders, and these variable's values: PreviousOpenOrders = 2 MaxTradesAux = 1. This helps EA to know it is in the sequence 1 of the martingale, not the second. If you put 4 NewMaxTradesAux, this means EA placed 4 orders with lot size equal to MaxLot (50 each one)??!! In a miniaccount, 1/200 leverage, you need $10.000 free margin. MyOrderType must be 0 for buy order, or 1 for sell order. Please, review this and tell me what happen. Rama

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi Rama, Can you please help me with this EA for managing my trades... I want a simple EA that looks after one trade. 1. Just SL variable and TP variable. So if it hits either the trade is closed out and it waits and listens for trades. I have an EA here, I was wondering if you could modify the code for it? This EA is coded by DGC, he has given the code out, but it works different to what I want it to do. Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Everybody looks for this aim. If it was easy, we all should be rich.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
It's a EA from TSD coded by Wolfe ( http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...ale-ea-15.html ) I tested this EA: there are many , many trades which open and finally the account blows up! Now it's the version 1.6 and it's the same thing ( I lost $ 450 today) I prefer Rama's system.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Oops... my bad... Sorry, I mean this EA They use this on the Oz system, I am just looking at a couple of things at the moment... and seeing if this works, as I cannot be looking at the screen all of the time. regards, guess

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Rama´s system is the best one so far, i´m just looking for improvements that can be done.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Now it work! Yes, now i know what this NewMaTradesAux mean. I just need to ajust the TP. But it works in the version 2.21, and don´t at 2.2, i need upgrade this acc. Thanks Rama.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Rama, i see a new bug (version 2.2), maybe u already fix it. The E/U open 5 orders 02/21, close the last one but don´t close the others at same time. The trades still open, i will close manually when i see a good moment. Attached chart

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi Numeral I knew the same problem. After the fifth order, probably you switched off your program or your computer. By launching again the program, on the left corner after NextLotSize, you have No Type Order and no Next Enter: xxxxx. The program recognize only the last order and its TP. If the prices reach the TP, the last trade is closed but others no. It's a real problem if there is a cut of program or a power cut.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Ok, thanks, it´s almost the same previous problem.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Rama, i´m starting to test it. Did u try make it with a risk less martingale, maybe 1.3x, can be used with a pipstep of 300pips. I see gbp/jpy pay more interest, but Gbp/Usd maybe is the best pair to intertest, with less risk. Gbp/usd pay $12.81 / full lot. Thanks for share their knowledge.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi Rama After several days of testing, I think you are right: the v 2.21 is better than MACD Stoch Martingale. Sorry for the work requested. About v 2.21, some questions: 1/ Could you attach the indicator SMMA used for the signal in the EA: I don't understand exactly how it works on the graph and I'd like a template with. 2/ How works EmergencyClose ? There is a number ( 9 ). How to use it exactly ? 3/ About StopTrading, if value is true, there is not another sequence after orders close. It is well that ? Some suggestions for the next version (v 2.22 ?) : 1/ Could you fix the bug which displays "label,label,etc" ? It's good for MACD Stoch but no for 2.21. 2/ Could you check again the numbers of ForceOpenTrade so that there is not confusion ? 3/ And finally - important- could you find a solution to restore all the lost parameters after an electric cut or a shut down of computer ? I know it's much work for you but you can be proud to have made a great program. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Here is an advance of what I’m working on. Forget all previous versions, to avoid confusion. I made a package with the following files: EA compiled (no code). Include files: AllOrdersControl and Info.mq4. Pre-settings for GBPUSD, USDJPY and EURUSD 1h. Template used. Back-test report on GBPUSD from June 2004 to February 2008. Documentation file. I said this is an advance, because I want to make a better explanation / presentation. This is just for you, to answer so many questions. Perhaps you can give more experience data from it usage. There are many problems solved. I'm running it on a real account. And it's working fine. I’m really sorry because I can’t spend too much time on this thread. I’m doing my best. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Fantastic work, Rama. In your PDF manual , there are all the answers at my questions. And the new EA restore perfectly the parameters after cut. Just a couple of questions: 1/ If I shut down the computer after the beginning of a sequence, will the trades be made as if the program was opened ? 2/ With your settings SMMA 100, how many trades on average do you have daily by pair ? and how many pairs do you trade on one account ? I ask for that because if there are many current sequences , it can happen a problem with the free margin. Regards. There is not template in the package but there is a file .ini

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Great work Rama, you r doing your best! Great system! Great explanation at .PDF I just don´t undestand what it is: "TradeBands=true or false" it´s to activate the use of "MALevel" ? Maybe have u tested with Bollinger Bands, like i see you write about in your PDF, - MALevel give you a better result? or u didn´t test with bollinger? I think u won´t belive... i was thinking just some minutes back to a kind of bollinger martingale... you suprised me!! great solution! Let´s see how is goes, if really works fine. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Madscalp: If computer shuts down nobody / nothing manages the opened trades. EA must monitor the market all the time. This new version can reload current opened martingale parameters automatically, also in a different computer. But martingale needs constant supervision. Last Monday EA opened a few orders, and after y left my office, an electric shut down put out of order the computer. I realized of that when arrived home. So I traded from there whit the same EA (using the same Magic Number). The problem was I was using now a telephone internet connection, so I need cut it. To do that, I placed manually, as pending orders, the next necessaries of the martingale. Change the take profit to the last known, and went sleep. Next morning two pairs touched their TP (GBPUSD &amp; CHFJPY), so I deleted the pending orders. The third one remains as I left at night (USDJPY). So when restarted my office computer, the reloaded of EA take care of it. I deleted the pending order remaining at that moment. You can see on report attached the deleted pending orders 26.02.2008 10:15 y 10:50. I’m going to install a better internet connection at home, so I have a backup terminal trading. With the settings used I’m trading on 3 pairs. On the report attached you’ll find more, but those were tests. When I have more than 4/5 orders on one pair, I use to stop trading on the others, until bigger martingale finishes. I’m thinking on a solution to control margin. I suppose EA stops trading automatically when there is opened more than X orders in other pair? I really don’t know. Mean while I monitor the execution. I have just closed a martingale on USDJPY with 7 trades. It was really stressfull, because I’m not at office. Be a forex trader is really a hard job. Stress and full time dedication. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hi Numeral: Yes I tested martingale with Bollinger Bands. I found out that too often price crosses bands without a real trend. Giving wrong singals. About TradeBands is one of those parameters i have just created, not explained in documentation. TradeBands or TradeMA is for enable / disable trade on band cross or ma cross. EUJPY and GBPJPY are really, really amazing trading only on bands. GBPJPY is not finished the test/error setting. Test it on these pairs. Now you have the option to trade only buy or sell. So if you disable all except TradeBands, and TradeLong, you can trade a martingale in the positive swap side, of xxxJPY for example. Good luck. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #153 ---
And the interest rates profits running... Ok, i will open another one to test it. Ps. keep one eye at martingale ea at tsd. http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...ale-ea-91.html some nice solutions... but scary ones too.. Regards,

--- 帖子 #154 ---
About this trade ( 2008.02.21), the sequence was until the 7th lot of value = 41.70 !!!!!!! With a maxlot of 50 and if had be needed an 8th lot, it was not possible. If maxlots = 50, how is it possible 9 trades max ? I think the first lot was badly calculated by the program. Right ?

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I think you are talking about the GBPUSD report, order 3554. Please see answer on "MaxLots" explanation of pdf file: MaxLots: Double parameter to set maximum lot size admitted by trader or broker on each order. On mini accounts brokers admit up to 50 lots on a single order. If trader don’t want to use lots bigger than 10, for example, it can be set. If order lot size is bigger than MaxLots, then EA will divide it in so many orders as it is necessary to complete the lot. These orders will be considered by EA as the same one. See example chart. I don’t think it is necessary use so big lot sizes. Nobody use them and if your account has a $20.000 balance, it isn’t mini. Your broker will change to standard, returning to lower lot sizes. If you want to see what could happen, test it with $30.000 initial capital, so EA make martingales with such big lots. MaxLots is for secure operation, not to put a limit. For lots limitation you must use risk, InitialFixedLots, PipsStep, and the rest of parameters used to set the martingale orders. Before you set the EA make your math on excel. So you can see how much margin is needed at each order, and how much loss you have to support. See on GU report "Absolute Drawdown" value. It is at 128.59. This means minimum balance was 128,59 below initial balance. This gives you an idea of maximum drawdown. Rama

Thank you for your explanations.

Rama, The only problem i find till now is when the computer is turned off or the energy power off.. to the trades back fine, is needed to do that settings (UptadeVar). I have one account, i make the correction settings, But it wasn´t ever the same.. create other problems because the distance of one order to another. .. and to avoid this happening at WEEKEND Gaps: I suggest, If you could create more one settings like TradeOnFriday = true/false, it will be great.. I use this option to safely get off the market. And other useful setting is trading hours... to avoid trade news time. but i don´t use this yet.. i haven´t test it with this option, on and off. Best Regards.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Rama, some more bugs. 1. G/U was with 7/9 trades opened, with a 6th with 5.00 lots, and the 7th with 0.74 lots (WHY? Because the MaxLots=5). I see it was too much and I modified 2 settings: FactorLot=4.0 to 3.0 and MaxLots=5.0 to 6.0. What happen? It instatly OPEN 14 trades with 6.0 Lots!!! I close one of them and all others was closing one by one automaticaly. So .. never change settings while you have trades opened. 2. In the test i was doing with 6 pairs that pay good swap, i don´t undestand how this TradeBands Works... i attaching one chart of the only trade from yesterday till now. I´m using 30min chart with the pairs: G/U, E/J, G/CHF, G/J, N/J. The G/J touch the MA Levels 120, a lot of times, but don´t open any trade. ( I put the option to only trade LONG. ) Regards,

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Remember change Magic number on EA if you want it recognize their orders. EA do it automatically when you set Magic number to the same of the opened orders. It works for me. Rama

--- 帖子 #160 ---
About TradeOnFriday=true/false, you can use StopTrading every Thursday afternoon, or Friday morning. Today I was going to do that, but I decided run some more risk. But tomorrow morning, I’m going to set StopTrading=ture. If at end day remain any order opened, I’ll close it manually if there is a small loss/profit. Just to have a nice weekend. You can do the same on news days. Remember, EA needs constant monitoring. You can't predict when a martingale can be closed. You must give EA enough time for close the martingale. I think is impossible trade until 30 minutes before a news event. So do it with 10/12 hours before. Rama

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Guys, Your effort to test and understand the idea really surprised me. I suggest start using EA with parameters set on files *.set uploaded on MA Martingale v3.0.zip to test and full understand how it works. They have the parameters with high return, low drawdown, and tested from 06/2004 till today. You must copy them on \expert\presets folder. Execute MT4 terminal, press F7 on the chart you are running the EA. On page “inputs” click bottom “load”. Look for the file copied on presets folder. Finally, assure the magic number for opened orders, and click accept. I’m uploading EURJPY setting, finished testing tonight. Next Monday I’m going to start trading alive this. It’s great. You can use it with a risk higher than the set one. Up to 0.30. About MaxLots parameter, forget it. This parameter is the maximum values broker allows on a single order. Why this parameter exists: because there are some brokers that use different maximum lot size. So simply set this parameter to 50 on mini, 100 on std. I am thinking on code the EA to calculate this value if trader set the parameter MiniAccount=true/false, to avoid this confusion. But it will be a problem if broker maximum lot size is different, particularly if it is smaller. Perhaps, simply changing the name to MaxBrokerLot?. I don’t understand the sequence you mention, why don’t you type it complete, or upload an excel? And, NEVER CLOSE ORDERS WHILE A MARTINGALE IS RUNNING. All will get close immediately. Except you want this. You can change the parameters when ever you want/need.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
The chart showed is trading the MA crossing, not the bands. To allow this, assure TradeBands =TRUE. And if you want to go long on the lower band only, set ReverseCondition=TRUE, and TradeShort=FALSE. If you only want to trade bands, set TradeMA=FALSE. Don't forget to study the pair you are trading on before do it. You must set the parameter of the bands: MALevel. This is very important. I forget to mention all tests were made on 30 minutes and 1 hour. Recommend use 30m only. Best regards, Rama

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Ok, Thanks! I ask about Tradebands and send the chart because i do what u told exactly: TradeMA=FALSE, TradeBands =TRUE, TradeShort=FALSE. TradeLong=TRUE. The only thing i don´t put is ReverseCondition=True. (Why i need set it to True?) I what to trade the entry signal condition. I will wait to see if this still happening in others trades. Thanks I´m making a lot of tests with a lot of variations of settings. I have one MT4 running only with pairs do u recommend and the parameters set on your files *.set. Right now i´m looking (in MT4 tests) for a math to give me more room. Like using 1.6x factor or 1.5x with bigger TP. Best Regards Nume

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Numeral: You are attached your computer (like me)? . I couldn't sleep tonite, so I came to see the thread. This is Reverse Condition documentation’s explanation: “ ReverseCondition: Boolean parameter for read inversed the indicator signals. If buy, then sell and vice versa. Many often, when signal appears is too late to enter a trade. Market starts its retrace when signal is given. So it is useful read on reverse the signal for trading currency pairs with these characteristics. Same technique applies working with lazy indicators. ” Trading bands enter short orders by default when price goes down trough lower band. If you want to enter a long position, instead default setting, looking for a positive swap, you must set parameter ReverseCondition=TRUE. I think you are looking buy low and sell high. And both profits (swap &amp; pips). You must use larger PipsStep and lower FactorLot as you said. Do your maths on a spreadsheet before run it. FactorLot of 1.5/1.6 gives much more room. You can support more trend against your position. But you also need a bigger retrace to return in profit. On my real trading style, larger martingale used to get closed on a couple of days. Tree days maximum. So swap isn’t important. Did you see “Brut Force EA”? This expert sends a buy order each 8 hours if price is under a Moving Average defined by trader. With a 300 TP. It’s a way to test the idea of “buy low, sell high”, mixed with a hold &amp; wait strategy. Good luck, and keep looking for your own method. This is the only way it works. Rama

Attached to computer! LOL. Yes.. almost. The night is good research and learn (it´s more quiet, my dauther is sleeping) The truth is I almost forgot the Fuerza Bruta.., I think i was more concentrate in stoch. but i already start to test it, now. It´s best start on monday, but today its ok. And about ReverseCondition, it´s a good point, i don´t think about it... a lot better buy in lows. I will change it. Thanks again!

i am developing a martingale EA i want you to have a look at it ,it works well with gbpusd it open X2 of the initial lot after every -100 pips.but can you make it to open another trade in the opposite direction i mean a sell so that will really reduce its risk and increase it profit.The idea is that the opposite position will only open 1 position at a time until the trend reverse. i want you to help because am a newbie programmer. i am having problem trying to attach the EA

--- 帖子 #168 ---
this is the EA NOTE it is still under development

--- 帖子 #169 ---
this is the back testing result

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Sodipo The backtesting seems fine. I did't really understand the working but I'll try next week. The program is very short and you must rename your file mqh in mq4 for using. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
it works based on martingale method,it opens an order with a predefined takeprofit and stoposs if the market trends in its direction it trigger the take profit and open another order.But if the market trends against it by 100 pip it opens another position X2 of the initial lot against the trend direction,then closes the loosing position this will continue till we get a major retracement.although this may look scary but i m yet to see 1000pips freefall in GBPUSD or EURUSD without retracement. For now The EA will only Place a buy order i am still working on it so that it can open both buy and sell at the same time, this will reduce its drawdown and boost the profit.it is really taking my time can someone give me a hand with this????

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi Numeral: You were wright about reducing FactorLot, this gives room to increase risk, so initial lot size could be bigger. This has to positive effects: Gives more room to place more orders, supporting much more market trend against your position. With the setting I tested, 8 orders are enough to close any martingale in profit. As you have more room on the following orders, this gives the chance to increase initial lot risk. Increasing profits of the most frequency martingale sizes. See this chart with martingale’s order size frequency: PHP Code Orders EURJPY GBPUSD USDJPY USDCHF 1 1088 779 385 327 2 258 456 250 177 3 169 211 112 97 4 78 120 62 69 5 32 59 38 47 6 13 43 15 21 7 4 18 8 11 8 6 10 7 7 9 0 0 0 6 TOTAL 1648 1696 877 762 As you can see, 93% +/- of the martingales uses up to 4 trades. If you increase lot size of them, this increases profits. But it is needed a FactorLot reduction to afford bigger martingales (the rest 7% of cases). Reducing FactorLot you could see a balance reduction after a big martingale, if it was entered on negative swap side. Pips profit in big sizes martingales aren’t enough to cover swap paid, if takes a few days to get close. But it isn’t too much. I don't trade USDCHF and EURUSD because they don't retrace enough. Kind regards. Rama

--- 帖子 #173 ---
What must EA do with the second order if it doesn't touch its take profit, and the first one, or principal order (i mean the one entered by a signal) touches profit price and gets closed? I'm not a professional coder, just another newbie with enough programming skills. I was thinking before on your idea for MA Martingale EA, but i really don't know how to solve the question asked. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Very interesting, Rama and thanks, Numeral. So, could you give a example of new settings for GBPUSD and EURJPY with a reducing factorlot ?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi rama, Thanks for the reply,try to instal and compile the EA i posted in the forum so that you can understand how it works properly. the EA do not use any indicator coz i believe using indicator will make the martingale system fail. i just finished working on an indicator based EA that makes atleast 25 percent in a month, just joking that is in backtesting. Bro we can do something good on martingale.i am a trader and a newbie programmer

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Madscalp, i was a little busy... so i late in the answer. What Rama show is the orders reach TP at first 4 or 5 levels of Step. For this case i don´t know what can be done. Maybe something like this: 1 level: Buy 0.1 lot ( 2x ) 2 level: Buy 0.2 lot ( 2x ) 3 level: Buy 0.4 lot ( 2x ) 4 level: Buy 0.8 lot ( 2x ) - if don´t reach TP .. start to looking for a good breakeven exit point 5 level: Buy 1.04 lot ( 1.3x ) - this can high the PipLevels for more security 6 level: Buy 1.35 lot ( 1.3x ) 7 level: Buy 1.75 lot ( 1.3x ) 8 level: Buy 2.28 lot ( 1.3x ) or something similiar. -/- A example of other reducing factorlot, using always small lots to handle with big movements. For that u need to look to TP/step ratio for profitable combinations. Factor: 1.4x - needs a ratio of: to 3x tp/step, or 3.5x - like step 10 / tp 30 Factor 1.5x - needs 2.5x or 3x of tp/step - steop 10 pips / tp 25 pips Factor 1.6x - 2x tp/step - step 10 pips / tp 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thanks for your reply. Actually,during the news, I'm trying different settings ( short PS and TP)against the trend on GBPUSD and EURJPY to see how martingale is working. But every time after the 6th level, I don't have enough margin. I'm looking for a best MM. What are your results with set provided by Rama ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Rama´s SET, i think need at least $5000 dollars. I have here 10% in less than one month.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Yes, nice point. This is something we need to learn. With what step/tp you find this orders reached frequency? This file is from someone who has already study something about hedge the orders. And here have something too: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=160

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Try these parameters: OrdenSalto = 5 Salto = 0.75 These will decrease 0.75 FactorPips on martingale sequence #5, reducing absolute lot size, and margin required in 25%. This gives you 25% more room to increase risk up to double. To keep a breakeven result, take profit of followings orders (6, 7, 8 … etc.) must be increased. This needs coding. But you can tests and see better results reducing lot size from sequence 5 of martingale. This is a system of 9% to 15% monthly profit. At least in back tests. Kind regards. Rama

--- 帖子 #181 ---
sodipo2k: I'm sorry, I can't help you. The EA is too simple, needs two much work, and I don't have an idea which is the "system" about. Please, excuse me. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Sodippo, Your EA is too simple but the back test results soo good. Let me check out your EA for sell too.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Great, good solution. Was u that create this Order Salto idea? And can work reducing more, like 50% (Salto=0.50), if was using a TP 2x of Step when i use the factor 4x. can work to get out minimizing the risk. Best Regards, Ps. i send a pvt msg.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
The trading system is simple that is why the EA is simple,and it is incomplete i only coded the buy side of it and i thought RAMA or anyone in this tread can complete it coz i am busy.i will complete it and post it soon. when completed the performance will be 1.5 times better.PM me for the result of the indicator based EA,This tread is for martingale

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Rama, let me ask you again, i think u didn´t see my early question; What was the step/tp u use to find this orders reached frequency?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
demoing this EA, great results up to now with the recommended settings. Any update on this? Thanks a lot Rama for this great EA

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yep, I second that. I use this EA in my small live account with great results. I know, the day will come where a margin call occurs... So thanks Rama, your EA is rocksolid. Just one comment: If I use mm=true, the lot size is too big. I use a €3,000 account and it uses starting lots of 0.06 in that case. That's too much for this account size... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #188 ---
You enter mm=false and InitialFixedLots=0.04 for example.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
As you can see on report attached, I made 31,5% in 37 calendar days (30 working days). But one day the feared Margin Call came. Circumstances of Margin Call: 1º Error: I run EA on tree / four pairs simultaneously. At 18/03/2008 morning I found GBPUSD with 6 orders opened. And USDJPY with 4. I had to close USDJPY at that moment because it was at breakeven. I didn’t do it. Later things came worst. 2º Error: I set EA on GBPUSD with MaxTrades = 9. It is too much. If I remain position with only 8, keeping USDJPY open, it had been enough to avoid margin call, as you can see the important market retrace a couple hours after FED announcement (17:30 GMT). My actual balance is on USD 640. I lost my 37 days profits, and 40% of my initial deposit. This weekend I’m going to code EA to stop trading if there is another pair (or magic number) with more than 4 trades. And if two pairs start martingale at the same time, when one of them reach 5 or more trades, set EA to close at least one of them at breakeven, freeing margin. Mean while, keep running EA during night on one pair only (GBPUSD – EURJPY my preferred) What I really don’t understand why the difference on entry prices of GBPUSD martingale on back test on 18/03/2008. If I run it on test mode, EA closes two martingales that day. First at 6:30 (gmt), and at the peak of 17:30, a buy one is opened and closed in profit at 22:00. But on real trading enter prices was different?? Forex mysterious… Rama.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Rama, sorry to hear that. To tell the truth, I had exactly the same GBP/USD position open! I closed it by hand some pips above the tp (around 2.0140, it was a short position) with a small loss. Luckiliy I had no USD/JPY position open at that time as I set the EA to stop mode there... Looking forward to your next version! Keep up the great work! Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #191 ---
This revision makes a log file on experts\files\log during EA running. And another file on tests\files\log during back tests. You can delete then at any moment you need. On back tests it shows you each new lower free margin, so you have a record of the lowest free margin available during the test. It ends report with a frequency statistic of martingales orders number. This gives you an idea how often big martingales occur. It also allows you set parameters for only trade long/short, on bands/MA separately. Ensure replace include files, and review settings. Good luck, and trades. Rama

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hello Rama, I test your system martingale since few days, and it is impressive. But a martingale method is dangerous. Can you implement a money management with, for example, an entry in MaxLoss% please? I can help you, but it is a compiled version. Thank you and very, very good job! Ps: sorry for my bad English

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hello Rama, Long time without news! Sorry for your losses. I´m reducing the factor lot with good results. If we Sum 7.68+3.84+1.92+0.96+0.48+0.24+0.12+0.06+0.03= 15,33 !! It´s to many lots for a $1000 account. Trading only 1 pair, really its a option. But maybe still a little high. I hope you find the solution. I´m attaching a good paperwork from NanningBob. He had some nice solution about martingale too. We need to have uniting forces. Kind Regards,

--- 帖子 #194 ---
This weekend I was running the EA and testing again those pairs which showed good results before – but – for my surprise they aren’t so profitable now??!! I noticed immediately that broker’s spreads became really wide: GBPUSD = 10 pips, EURUSD = 8 pips, GBPJPY = 15 pips!!, etc. I use IBFX and they don’t use to wide their spreads at night. Sometimes they do it, just 1/2 pips on some pairs (CHFJPY, NZD, AUD, etc.). At first I thought this change was not only for the holidays and weekend. I thought it was a consequence on Fed interest rate cut. I know some brokers use both swap and spreads for this kind of adjust. But 8 pips spread on EURUSD were too much. Luckily, today all the spreads came back to normality. The lessons I learned from this are: 1. History data is referred only to BID prices. Terminal reads the spread of the moment you are running them and add it to that price. 2. For that reason, back tests can show such different results depending on the moment you run them. Not only the broker make the difference. So execute the same EA test, with exactly the same parameters in different moments – NY opened (-4/-5 GMT) during the week, 2/3 hours after NY close, and weekends or holidays – If it passes all those journals, the parameters and the EA are reasonable reliable. Rama

I’m uploading the code of this new martingale version, so some of you could do a better home work. Excuse me on some disordered and unsystematic coding. I use to type it as I can, then I review it for a better coding and organization. As you can see it takes too much work, so I hope nobody sell it in internet. As I said before, I’m uploading a new version which has a semaphore incorporated. You must set “TradeCriticQtty” parameter with the order number in a martingale from where the red light is on for the rest of the EAs executing on the same terminal. Suppose you want to stop trading automatically on the other pairs when one of them open order 4. Set TradeCriticQtty = 4 on each EA and timeframe. Minimum value could be 1, maximum value could be MaxTrades. This only lights on semaphore’s red light. It doesn’t close any order. The opened orders will follow their natural way, and when (if) they get closed, each EA without opened orders will stop starting new trading. This new parameter uses a global variable you can see, delete and modify manually at any moment you want, by pressing F3 on your terminal. If its value is cero, there aren’t critic trades open. If a critic trade is opened, global variable CriticTrade, will show Magic Number of the EA managing that martingale. To disable this parameter, simply set it value with a number bigger than MaxTrades. Rama

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I add to version 3.3 trailing stop function. By the moment, trailing stop works only when martingale is bigger than 1. When last order in the martingale hit its take profit price, EA modifies stop loss of the remaining orders, instead closing them. Stop loss price is equal to last order entered and remaining open plus spread (or minus spread if it is a sell order – both cases on profit side price). Repeat if last order touches take profit again. And so on until full martingale could be closed in profit. If market retraces again, stop loss will be hit, and complete martingale closed. The best results are showed when difference between TakeProfit parameter and PipsStep is bigger than maximum spread of the pair used. For this purpose I choose increase TakeProfit instead reduce PipsStep. I’m still working on trailing stop of first order, and a stop loss at breakeven plus spread. Trailing stop on first order will avoid pay new spread when you enter market repeatedly in a strong movement on your favor, as EA work now. Breakeven stop loss will help, I think, to avoid enter big martingales, or lost your account after you were in the positive side, as I done before. Perhaps, this last will cut profits too soon. Perhaps not. Lets see. Rama

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I founded a setting for this pair with trailing stop. It has incredibly profitable backtest. And the best of all is that this setting runs good with a spread of 15 pips!!!! Delete .txt extension before you copy to Presets folder. It was changed for uploading purpose only. In all martingales, you need at least USD 1000 balance if you start with 0.01 lot, and MaxTrades = 9. If not, you are running a big risk until you reach that balance. This was my mistake, I made my math after I entered the market. Kind regards, Rama

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thanks again, Rama! Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Congratulations,Rama. To avoid news times generally dangerous for a martingale, maybe could you incorporate in the EA a start time and a end time. For example the EA will start at 18:00 GMT (after news time) until 13:00 GMT tomorrow (just before news time). If the user wants a permanent working, he sets the same time. There is an EA (10p3) which is working like that.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Lot of News! Lets try it. Best Regards

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi Mad. Yes, this is a good option, to use with scalp, like tp 10 step 5. Regards

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi Numeral I'm using actually V 3.00 with the same settings that 10p3 (TP 10 and PS 7) 10p3 uses MACD as signal and Rama SMA but the results seem good for both. I'd like to avoid news time for safe http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #203 ---
This is a good idea. I think time control setting will be a usefull tool. I think if it works like a global variable would be better than setting for each EA, one by one. What do you think about a variable you set it value pressing F3 only once, and it works for all EA running at that moment? Hope it is coded on next revision, when trailing stop is finished. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi Rama Yes, you can do that. For me, it's not really important because I trade only one pair every time because I have yet a problem of call margin. Regards.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Great, i haven´t see something like that in others EAs. The EA is already doing very well.. I´m imagin how it will be great with that option. About trailing stop, i don´t like it much. Because it almost every time cut the profits. But can be a good tool to dark volatile times . Again. Rama, Thanks for sharing this great ea and system. Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi, I stopped the EA today and finish this month. Will withdrawal the money it made. I'm up about 30%, starting the EA with 0.01 lot in my 3,000€ account. The MC might come sooner or later, we'll see if I can reach the break even area first. Thanks again Rama for this nice EA! Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #207 ---
What are your settings and what pair in live ? thanks.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I use GBP/USD, GBP/JPY and USD/JPY. The GBP-pairs with trailing stop, USD/JPY without trailing stop. The settings are the ones from Rama. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Excellent results, congratulations. Just a couple of questions: Your three pairs are working together on the same live account ? For what pair and what maximum of trades did you have on one sequence for this month ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I started this month using the feature mm=true. This lead the EA to use 0.06 lot for the first position which is too much. I changed it to 0.01 lots. Before the changes the highest position was 2.15 lot in GBP/USD. It was the trade, where Rama got his margin call. I closed this position at break even by hand as I ran out of margin. My open positions were -900€ in the lowest. After changing the starting amount to 0.01 lot everything went smoother. The highest position was around 0.16 lot, so not that much. Starting with 0.01 doesn't sound so much, but the half of the profits (15%) I made using these settings. I think a $1,000 account is the lowest for this method, but you should trade only one pair then. I've attached my statement from march and wow, it was almost 40%... There are 4-5 small EUR/USD positions inside where I tested another EA, just ignore them. It was a small loss of around 5€ I think. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I agree with you. MM=true is not a good solution: as you I'm going to try an initial lot of 0.01. But I'm still waiting to open a live account http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif What weather in Germany ?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Currently sunny but cold. We got a lot of snow some days ago south of munich but it's already gone... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi Xaron: Really nice to hear about your results. This kind of news moves me to continue working on this. I have to say also thanks to all of you guys for your support. Just be careful with money management. From my last MC I learned a lesson. So I’m using now the excel attached this post to set parameters values, and check maximum direct drawdown my account could resist before a market retrace. Margin call caught me by surprise, because I didn’t make my math. Remember “mm” parameter is most useful for back tests than for real trading. On real trading you have the chance to modify it manually (InitialFixedLots) at any time. Also with opened orders. I think if you have $1.000 balance you can start with 0.02 lots if the step between each new order is between 30/40 pips (PipsSteps &gt;30). See examples on spread sheet. I’m following Madscalp suggestion: trade only one pair at a time. If there isn’t any EA signal, but I see other indicators pointing a trade, I prefer enter it manually (ForceTrade = 0/1) and let the EA manage them. So now, I’m using only EURJPY because it retraces nice, and spread is low. This week I finished 6,70% up, with a few manual orders, and no surprises. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #214 ---
As Numeral said before, trailing stop reduces total profits. If you compare on same pair and parameters back tests, you’ll see that. Trailing stop reduces the number of orders opened, and this reduces profits too. I think closing orders is better than keeping them running as much as it is possible, because you can compound profits, and you don’t lost the pips between stop loss and next take profit target. This range is bigger than spread paid. Closing orders also avoids paid swap when martingale is in the negative side. I also think profits could be improved running the same EA parameters on same pair in two different charts at the same time. One trading only long, the other one trading only short. So you can catch most signals. If you see chart below, a martingale crossed from lower band to upper one. This avoided buy signal showed in blue, because there was an opened martingale (short) in the opposite direction of the signal (buy). Running EA on separately charts (one short the other long) helps to catch all signals without risking more if you can hedge on your account. The chart shows an opportunity of 184 pips “long martingale” missed by a previous “short martingale” opened. What do you think about this? Rama

--- 帖子 #215 ---
hi rama i am demoing exactely that gbpusd "hedge" since march 13. It goes fine. It kept me out from the 18 march margin call. I am 10% up now (15 days) using 0.1 lots inicial size for each of the gbbusd martingales with inicial account balance of 50.000 (quite secure margin). I am expecting to go as secure as possible and to have a 10% returm monthly, so i ll reduce the lots to 0.05 for each martingale. Thanks for your hard and generous work!!!!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I remmeber since the begining you talk about this trade buy and sell in different chart. I don´t test it yet. But i really think it can make a great improvemnt at profits. Thanks a lot for the margin calculator, is was like a glove. I think it will help me a lot with my accounts. I think the learning pair by pair, to find the correct TP and Pipstep and of course the math to don´t get a margin call, is the secret for forex trading. And need to be keeped in safe. If not, can change all forex brokers world and limitations. Many people winning and a few losing. This can´t happen (or can be?). What u guys think about it? Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #217 ---
It's an excellent idea. We are reaching the perfect strategy http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif . Thanks for the excel file: it's a precious help. Just a question about MM. Why with MM=true, a balance of $ 3000 for only one pair after the 6th trade on a sequence, the EA displays "Not enough margin" ? Impossible to reach the 9th ! I think there is a problem of management (maybe a wrong feature of risk) and I prefer to put MM=false and fix myself the initial lot. Could you post your set for the pair EURJPY ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I am having trouble loading .mq4 files onto my charts, can someone please tell me how to do it please.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Thanks Rama for the spreadsheet! As far as I see you've changed some parameters? You use a factor of 1.9 instead of 2.05 but a TP of 44 now for the EUR/JPY? Do you use still the reverse signal and 1h chart on the EUR/JPY like in your PDF file? Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #220 ---
That’s a great question. Market conditions change continuously and each one are unique. So we must keep reading and learning those situations pair by pair, day by day. The EA helps to avoid us live fixed to our monitor trading terminal. It doesn’t do trader work: analyze market situations. So, these are the clues, I think: - EA is a tool to do trading mechanic work. - Trader is the brain planning the trade (and trading the plan). About changes on forex brokers conditions: it happened before, as I read it on other forum. When too many traders made huge profits on news events, brokers starts to freeze trading server at that moment, or wide spreads . You know it is not possible trade on news at every broker. The only way you can do it is trading standard lots directly with the money banks. Not trough a forex broker, the market makers. Retail traders are captive of brokers. Paradox: retail forex wouldn’t exist without brokers. Conditions definitively could change. Identify the change is trader work, not the EA. From a wide point of view, a strategy must contain this kind of thoughts. So share ideas like Numeral’s is very important, as it is important share EA executing experiences and results. Rama

What determines the margin usage are always, and only the following parameters: InitialFixedLots, risk , PipsStep, OrdenSalto, Salto, FactorLot and FactorPip. No other one. "mm" parameter does not determine, in any way, margin usage. It simply allows EA apply this formula: AccountBalance()*risk/Account Leverage (i.e. 3.000*0.15/10000 = 0.045 lots, rounded to 0.05). If "mm" is disabled EA does not calculate initial lot as percentaje of balance. It uses InitialFixedLot. If you don't have enough margin depends on values set on the parameters mentioned. Which are they? Rama

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I keep the original parameters if trailing stop is set to false. They work fine on 30m or 1h. 44 TP is just for give room with trailing stop parameter set to true. 1.9 is because i still have a low balance. I need to make a new deposit or accumulate profits. Regards Rama

Download file "MA Martingale v3.0.zip" and read pdf with the same name saved in it. I also suggest read posts 30, 31, and 99. If it doesn't work, post again specifying wich is the trouble. Good luck. Rama

My problem is that I am trying to include an indicator from another thread, I can save it but cannot upload it, once it has been saved, just wanted to know the procedure. I think you have to save to your expert indicator folder, this is what I am having trouble with, how do I save to my expert indicator folder, and then insert it to my charts.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Oh you're a newbie http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif It's easy: once the indicator has been introduced in expert folder &gt; indicator, close Metatrader and restart it. Then click Display &gt; Navigator and normally you must find your indicator in the column "Programmed Indicators". Right Click on your indicator then Chart attach.

I really love EURJPY. Look what beautyfull movements. It gives 3% daily average profit. It seems it doesn't matter when you enter the market!! Rama

I fully agree. Could you post your used preset for EURJPY ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Good morning, I think I've found a bug. Something strange had happened last night in the USD/JPY. Currently I trade 3 pairs, GBP/JPY, GBP/USD and USD/JPY. I've set TradesCriticQtty to 6, so no new trades had been opened for GBP/JPY and GBP/USD as I entered the 6th progression exactly at 10:00am (EST, which is 15:00 GMT). No other trades but the USD/JPY was open. The 7th progression was entered at 15:24 GMT, the 8th at 15:44 using 1.39 lot (I start with 0.01). At 00:58 GMT the complete grid was closed (I use no trailing stop for USD/JPY) at 101.59. Then the strange happened: The progression did not start at 0.01 lot again but continued with 2.85 lot at 01:00 GMT + 5.84 lot at 01:55 GMT! Again short orders which should not had been opened anymore! Luckily the EA closed both positions at 02:37 GMT with a small loss... I've attached the statements and a screenshot + my preset file. After that everything went to normal... edit: I've added the MT4-log. Looks like there was a disconnect. It logged in at 01:06:20 (GMT +1) Regards - Xaron

Hi Xaron, Thanks for the information. I will check it immediatlly. This kind of coding could be tested only on forward, no way on back test. Regards. Rama

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Thanks Rama! It might have something to do with the grid which wasn't closed in time? Inserted Code 01:59:37 'XXXX': order #797217 sell 0.02 USDJPY at 99.84 sl: 0.00 tp: 99.48 closed at price 101.59 01:59:37 'XXXX': close order #795198 sell 0.01 USDJPY at 99.50 sl: 0.00 tp: 99.14 at price 101.57 01:59:39 'XXXX': request was accepted by server 01:59:39 'XXXX': request in process 01:59:41 'XXXX': order #795198 sell 0.01 USDJPY at 99.50 sl: 0.00 tp: 99.14 closed at price 101.59 01:59:56 'XXXX': instant order sell 2.85 USDJPY at 101.54 sl: 0.00 tp: 100.16 01:59:56 'XXXX': request was accepted by server 01:59:56 'XXXX': requote 101.56 / 101.59 for open sell 2.85 USDJPY at 101.54 sl: 0.00 tp: 100.16 02:00:37 'XXXX': instant order sell 2.85 USDJPY at 101.54 sl: 0.00 tp: 100.16 02:00:39 'XXXX': request was accepted by server 02:00:40 'XXXX': request in process If you look at the time codes there were some requotes as the EA tried to close the grid down. Maybe the EA thought about to open a new order because the grid wasn't closed fast enough? Just a guess... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Xaron: There is a log file created by the EA, not MT4 terminal. It has information I coded to be displayed, with more details. Could you please post it? The file is on c:\program files\metatrader\experts\files\logs\Log_2000(USDJPYm,30m) Its name may be: Start_2008.03.01.txt It creates a new one each new day you restart EA. You can also delete them at any time you want. If you keep loaded the EA for many days, its name will be the starting day. I could see some requotes, but what happened is that the variables weren't updated (resettled to cero). As if the EA didn't notice that martingale get closed. Rama

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi Rama, I've attached the log files for all 3 pairs (I've just renamed them to attach them here) Thanks and best regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I think i founded the problem: order #805294 couldn’t be closed after 5 retries. EA gives up at 01:59:36 (“No se pudo cerrar orden: 805294 Error: 0 no error). Then continued closing the rest of the martingale. And when it finished, remain opened order 805294. As you can see on your account report, this order was closed at 03:37 at 101,75 price with the two following orders after “the problem” appeared. Now is clear for me what was the problem. I’m working on it. Mean while, if you don’t use trailing stop, I recommend use TrailingProfit = true. This will change take profit to the same price (take profit price of the last order). This has the advantage that orders will get closed on your broker’s server. Your computer could be disconnected. Is the most effective way to close a martingale. Sorry for this bug. I’m going to correct it. Good luck. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thanks Rama! You don't have to apologize! Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I’m confused. I can’t find why EA skipped this line: " if (PreviousOpenOrders&gt;_ExpertOrdersTotal &amp;&amp; _ExpertOrdersTotal &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; !TrailingStop)" At 01:59:41 closed last martingale’s order (#795198), remaining opened ticket #805294. Fifteen seconds later, at 01:59:56 continued opening orders as martingale’s was still open. Xaron, could be possible that you pressed at that moment “Expert Advisors” bottom on your trading terminal, just for the few 15 seconds between server closing confirmation and the new order (01:59:41 to 01:59:56)? What I found is that a RefreshRates() when opening, closing and modifying orders helps to avoid requoting. Supposing that line could be skipped, the values necessary for the opened order are inconsistent with those settled during closing procedure. An EA execution interruption must be necessary for that. I’m going to follow this closely, but for the moment, the only improve was the refresh rates command. Rama

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Rama, at that time I was sleeping. But using your TrailingProfit should solve this problem anyway. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Rama I will start the test of this new function. You are always in front. When I think in flour, you come with the cake. (Me too, i hope nobody sale it on the Internet, its a amazing ea) Regards

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi Rama, had another problem today with the GBP/USD. The EA did open with 0.16 lots two times instead doubling up to 0.32... I've attached the EA log file. For me it looks like the last try to open a 0.16 lot order was ok, but the EA thought it wasn't ok? Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Hi Xaron: I could see on the log file posted that you are running the first version with trailing stop. There is a sentence that shows you the breakeven price and the time it has been reached that level (i.e.12:04:46 MA Martingale v3.3 GBPUSD,M30: BreakEvenPrice :1.9796) I abandoned this functionality because I cuts profits. As Numeral posted before, trailing stop doesn’t work, specially with small difference between take profit and stop loss prices. The important here is that the version you are running is like a beta version. Not fully tested . So try the one uploaded now. I’m running it on a VPS, without any problems. I understand now why it have no sense the closing problem you have had. Version 3.31 has trailing stop for martingales with more than one opened order. It doesn’t use breakeven price as stop loss. It places stop loss at enter price of the last order remaining opened plus spread, when each take profit is hit. So if you use a PipsStep price to close from TakeProfit, you will have problems modifying the order’s stop loss. You must copy ChartWindow.mqh on experts\include folder before compile the EA. This detects chart’s background color (black or white) and modifies the color on top left corner. Good luck. Rama

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Thanks so much Ramiro! Please don't feel stressed. Even if this EA would blow my account I'd take the responsibility for this of course. It's only a small account. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Aham! Good! Now i don´t need to change the background color!! Rama, what is the VPS u r using? I don´t know how use it yet, but i think can be a good choice for me with only one computer. Thanks

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Rama I am currently using your MA Martingale EA 3.0 and the MACDSTOCH Martingale, and both are working like a charm. Thanks for sharing. I was wondering if you could make one modification to them, sort of custom as I am not sure others would be to interested in the change. I was wondering if you could modify in the "EmergencyClose_desc" from moving to a break even, to just closing the run and all the trades in the run, even though it would be at a loss, and then just have it immediately start again through the progresion. Thanks again for a great EA.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi Xaron.. With wich broker are you running this ea on? Alpari?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Yes, Alpari UK.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
The VPS I’m using was founded here in forexfactory. I think there is no problem to post the link, because it is already posted in this web: http://www.commercialnetworkservices.com/ It is really useful. Today for example, was a crazy one for my computers: At midmorning a machine working in the street cut a main electricity cable, so full energy gone away on a wide zone. And my orders recently opened, alone … At midday, I could return home, and founded another problem: telephone line was out of order. And my orders recently opened, alone … It was incredibly crazy what happened. Just a few minutes ago from now I could recover my home telephone line. Logged on the VPS, and it makes $4 on a $750 balance, and keep running. I think that without the VPS today I could blow up my account (again). I think with conservative parameters could be a milk cow. Rama

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Jacob: I think there is no problem to code a closing point. I think a Boolean parameters will help. For example: Let’s call it CloseOnEmergency (true / false). If it is true, martingale will get closed at order number EmergencyClose, instead of open a new one. If it is false, EmergencyClose works like now, without any change. It’s ok? About time managing, and many other things, I have to say that I coded it. It just needs to be tested. But I founded that some many conditions before enter / close / modify an order make the EA lazzy. Under fast market conditions this would be a problem. Remember keep it simply. I hope will post it on next weekend. Regards. Rama

I left this EA running on a demo account..it blew it in less than 24 hours: http://www.shareapic.net/preview3/007399012.gif Did i do something wrong maybe? I forced buy and i reduced risk to 0.01.. didnt work

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Need to see some stuff.. its needed: Mini Account (trade pennies), Money to Margin Good correlation of Pip Step and TP. Can u tell what settings do u use?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Rama That would be fantastic, thanks again for your help.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Sure! I downloaded the preset for usdjpy done by Rama.. I launched and i noticed that it was going to open too many lots for my taste..so i changed "risk" (should be the lot multiplier) to 0.01..this made it to open (like i wanted) the sequence of 0.01-0.02-0.04 and so on.. Then since i wanted to test how it would do in a dangerous condition i changed to force buy even if i thought the pair would probably go south. The demo money was enough, almost 5000 and the single order was of 0.01 lots (i think that would be 0.10$ per pip..i'm a bit confused because it seems like my Metatrader interprets one pip as the 0.00001 instead of the 0.0001 wich i'm used considering)..

--- 帖子 #251 ---
hi i ve been running this in a home pc connected to internet 24 a day, on a conservative "set and forget basis" setup since march 13. Almost one month now and i am 18% up.I am using gbpusd ea in 2 different charts (one following ma and bands and the other reversing them) witht the recommended tp and sl. I am using 0.1 lot for each ea, money monegement set to false (starting balance 50.000 in demo). I ll try to post statement.So it seems that running it and being conservative it could reaaly be a milk cow.With this results i would even de more conservative, running 0.05 for each ea, expeting for a 8 -10% monthly.thanks everybody for sharing, specially rama (rama you are really generous and we all appreciate this)

hi all..ive heard that there's a PDF file with detailed instructions on how to use this EA..i have browsed all files attached to this thread but the only pdf i have seen is a test report.. where can i find the pdf? also..this EA uses indicators..do i have to attach them to chart manually or the EA will just consider them automaticly? thx for any help

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Here is MACD STOCH Martingale with closing orders before opening emergency order number. You will find back tests show an important increase of loses with this new function. I think that parameter used on the other EAs, called “SecureProfit”, is a better way to preserve your account from loses. You can set the percentage of your balance to close your position. It could be positive or negative. That means your martingale will get closed before your take profit if this value is positive. In case it is negative, this will represent your maximum admitted loss. As you can find here in forexfactory, stop loss and trailing stops are fallacies. So, even though I coded stop loses and trailing stop functions, I’m not using them. I think it is better follow your trades, and if you don’t feel comfortable just close them manually, or move your emergency close order number, or set a low positive risk value, a place a stop loss, or hedge, and so on. You have too many ways for manage your position. Martingale money management style have the power to give you enough time to do what ever you decide before face a big loss. I’m running simultaneously the same EA and parameters in a demo and real accounts. This is to check out my own mistakes or successes. On Thursday I had a short position on USDJPY. Market moved up 200 pips against it, entering 8 trades. This scared me, so I change risk to 1%. Luckily I did it, because it get closed a couple hours later, before swap is paid, with 1% profit. Demo account keeps opened this position until 10:30 of following day. This would be much stress. Remember EA’s facilitates manage your trades. It doesn’t do trader work: analyze market situations. Good luck. Rama

Hi Rama! I don´t know what i´m doing wrong... but with this last version 3.31 are not opening new orders. Only with force method. It´s all fine, i use different magic numbers for each pair, i see the MA crosses on pairs... I see a message: Critic Trade on other EA. (i´m not using other ea in this mt4) And.. StopTrading: No / Is TradeAllowed: Yes / Is ExpertEnable: Yes Maybe i need reinstall mt4.

Thanks Xaron. I will test it. But i want to see this function (TradesCriticQtty) working too. I will change to see if start to open orders. Regards

--- 帖子 #259 ---

Thanks, now its working. Rama, if u could help, I know what this do: EmergencyClose=(Level Number) // Close with small profit or close in breakeven. This is ok. I just don´t understand exactly what are this others settings: TrailingProfit=true or false // Will start trailing from the TakeProfit we choose ? TrailingStop=true or false // Whats the difrerence from TrailingProfit? How change the TS number? You did explain about 2 ways of closing a TrailingProfit; . Closing All and . Modifying All How i manage them? I trying to make what u tell about : "EA will close each martingale order at better prices. You Don´t show your real target to your broker" and another thing, how use SecureProfit ? change it, but don´t see results. Thanks a lot, Kind Regards

Rama, I am wondering if this new version of Meta trader 216 is giving me trouble compiling 2 functions the log and orders count files that go into the include folders. Pls check tks Berdj

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi this sounds like a good strat. I like the original method, just wondered if ppl were having much success and what pairs to avoid. I like the idea that it can give you better interest than a bank HAHA. Also I see the drawdown can be very high so what account size would you say is suitable to take this? EDIT* I also notice that the lot sizes are multiplied by factor 4, and that you make more profit further down you go. To have a lower drawdown could you just multiply by factor 2 instead? Make less profit but a safer option if its possible?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi Rama, can I get a copy of this MA Martingale?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi Numeral: EmergencyClose identifies the orders quantity a martingale must have opened to close it when its P/L is cero o bigger. For example: if you set this parameter to 8, after order #8 is opened, EA will close it when pips P/L + swap is equal or grater than cero. With less than 8 opened orders (1 to 7 orders) martingale will get closed when TP is touched. This is the algorithm: if(_ExpertProfitTotal &gt; 0 and _ExpertOrdersTotal &gt;= EmergencyClose) then close all. TrailingProfit changes take profit on all orders in a martingale to the same TP price used on the last one entered. For example: Order # Enter TP 1 1.5 1.5050 When next order is opened: Order # Enter TP 1 1.5 1.5 (modified by parameter TrailingProfit = true) 2 1.495 1.5 When next order is opened: Order # Enter TP 1 1.5 1.495 (modified by parameter TrailingProfit = true) 2 1.495 1.495 (modified by parameter TrailingProfit = true) 3 1.49 1.495 And so on… On real and live trading, this means not back test nor demo, orders are closed at different prices because of natural delay on processing one by one. You send one instruction at a time, wait for the result, and if it is OK, try to close next. This takes too much time, and it requires your EA working fine: energy, connection and coding bugs problems could interfere on this process. To ensure closing all at the same price, you can change TP at the same price on all orders opened of the same martingale, using TrailingProfit. This shows to your broker your target. You can modify take profit manually at any moment also. It doesn’t affect the normal operation. TrailingStop changes stop loss when last order's TP is hit. The rest of the martingale keeps opened, instead closing it, with a SL equal to last enter price plus (or minus, positive side) spread, letting profits run. It is needed a wide difference between TakeProfit and StopLoss parameters, because stop loss price could result too close from market price, getting closed complete martingale immediately, or worst: invalid stop loss, and your martingale will remain opened without stop. This works nice on big timeframes with wide TP and PipsStep. For example (spread = 4): Order # Enter TP SL 1 1.5 1.5050 none 2 1.4950 1.5 none 3 1.49 1.4950 none Last opened order touches its TP: Order # Enter TP SL 1 1.5 1.5050 1.4954 (modified by parameter TrailingStop = true) 2 1.4950 1.5 1.4954 (modified by parameter TrailingStop = true) Last opened order touches its TP: Order # Enter TP SL 1 1.5 1.5050 1.5004 (modified by parameter TrailingStop = true) It could happen (on back test at least) that all the orders get closed at each original TP. In my modest opinion TrailingStop doesn’t work. It is a one of the forex myths. Note: If you enable TrailingProfit and TrailingStop simultaneously, trailing stop is not going to work. Complete martingale will get closed at TP target. SecureProfit is the profit target on a martingale as balance % for close all. If you want to close all when 0.5% profit is reached, what ever the number of orders opened in a martingale, set parameter SecureProfit = 0.5 This is the algorithm: ProfitTarget = AccountBalance*SecureProfit/100 And close all if(_ExpertProfitTotal &gt;= ProfitTarget). You can change this value at any moment. And it could be used as take profit. Simply delete take profit on your orders, or use a very big one, and use a low reasonable SecureProfit percentage. To disable SecureProfit use 100% (SecureProfit =100) or bigger. I hope this helps. For better understand how it works, try to back test them separately. First disable all of them, except one, and try it. Then change another one, and so on. Good luck. Rama

Just for info. The EA runs great. I'm up more than 20% this month. Will post the statement by end of april. Thanks Rama! Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Thanks Rama, the threads answer my questions kind of. I wondered if somone clever here might want to make an EA to try out. It is simple, basically it is orginal method. If RSI is above 50 it makes a buy, if under 50 it sells. TP variable e.g. 10, 15, 20 or 30, stop loss also variable. But if the stop loss is hit it opens a trade in the opposite direction with the same stop loss and TP. The RSI might not even be needed if it can just open the first trade either a buy or sell. So e.g. EA is started up, places a buy but later the stop loss is hit, so it enters a sell, then stop loss hit so enters a buy......untill profit is reached. Also could it be limited only rebound 7 times then if profit is not hit it does not continue. Also could it be made so that it will stop running as soon as there have been 2 winning trades? Also would need to double the lot size if loosing trade made. If it wins a trade it opens a new trade starting from 0.01 lot again in the same direction as the last. E.G. just won 10 pips going long, it immediatly re-opens another long trade, if sl hit reverse, if tp hit ea shuts down. I would like to make it myself but I have no idea where to look for tutorial so hopefully somone is able to do this? Or if somone can point me where to look to learn how to code EA?

Did you analyze what would happen on ranging days? Rama

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I am up too, 15%. I think I may increase my balance at least up to 2.500 / 3.000, so profits could be withdraw. This will give more room also, for simultaneously martingales, and higher TradesCriticQtty number, as you are doing Xaron. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yeah I have looked back and looked back again just now. It seems fine if you have a low take profit and stop loss, obvoisly not too low say around 15 pip? But sounds like I am missing something. Ill look bak at posts but cudnt see anything on it.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
If you have a low TP you will need a lower PipsStep (stop loss). And martingale money management method showed on back tests and real trading that must support big movements. So 15 TP/SL will blow your account too soon. In addition, RSI makes zig zag on ranging markets. See it at the end of each day, before Sydney opening. RSI moves continuously up and down. This will make you enter in false, getting worst if you reverse your position. If you can find a setting for RSI, Stoch or MACD not zig zaging on lateralized markets, please post it and will try the method. Kind regards Rama

--- 帖子 #278 ---
As I mentioned before, I’m running same EA and settings on same server, in different sessions, one on real, and the other on demo account. I did it just to see if there could be differences on real vs. demo using exactly the same computer, connection and broker. The best part of this test is that the log file is the same. So I can see the ticket on real, and immediately the ticket on demo. So it isn’t necessary compare records. Yesterday, demo account opened two martingales with 5 (2+3) total opened orders on GBPJPY. Closed all of them before swap paid time. On real account, first martingale was missed because a disconnection at that time. As reconnection occurred a few minutes later, a martingale started in that point. It opened 6 orders, and earned swap (BUY), getting closed today at Asian session. Another thing I noticed also is that the order execution on demo account has better results than on real. I suppose it is because broker server must confirm your real order (i.e.: free margin), and on demo it is not necessary. So it is necessary work on reviewing EA orders managing, not only to inform errors, but also to manage them. For those who are trading real, be careful on this. Rama

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I've done some demo and live forward testing on various EA's. The results can be significantly different, especially when it comes to Martingales ... yes, becareful indeed ...

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks for your reply's. The idea I had was to not actually use ANY indicators I only said RSI just in case it needed it to get it started. Is it not possible to just try and see whether the Buy and then Sell if stop loss is hit untill profit is reached? When you say it has been tested and shows on low volatility it blows the account, I dont see these tests, only tests for the EA you made that will only buy when in a buy signal, and sell when in a sell signal? Basically forgetting all indicators all together, just an EA that will buy then if stop loss is hit, it will enter a sell, if stop loss is hit then enter a buy again untill take profit is reached? I hear what your saying about the low volatility and it blowing the account but I dont see it.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
There's already indicators out there like what you're describing. As a matter of fact, I have one now, but needs to be tweaked. It's similar to one of those Stop and Reverse Martingale ...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Sounds good. Are you going to be sharing it when its done? I like the sound of rama's ea also but the thing I dont like is when it goes against the trend.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
ditto

--- 帖子 #288 ---
What does it do again, and what type of problems ??? It might be the same one that I have ...

--- 帖子 #289 ---
It places order either at set time, or set pips or just long whatever you choose. Then if your stop loss is hit it enters an order in the opposite direction, if stop loss hit again it enters again in opposite direction untill your take profit is reached. On the thread I saw this on they said it doesnt perform well on backtests. From what I see it doesnt immediatly increase lot size but holds the lot sizes untill it decides it wants to increase your lot size, which is why I think the backtest doesnt work. If it would just increase the lot size with each change in trade direction Im sure it would prove profitable.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I have one that does exactly what we're looking for, but it's programmed to only trade once per day ... I'll get the code soon so we can tweak the living sh*t out of it ....

Hi Rama, I've another (small) issue with your latest EA. If the critic variable is set it doesn't become reset after the critic sequence has been closed. I have to do this always manually. Nevertheless I'm up more than 20% this month. Will post the statement by end of april. Thanks! Regards - Xaron

Rama I can't even place the ea on the chart it is strange. So I tried compiling the ea but that didn't work either.

That would explain why .... I'll have to try that out ...

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi Rama, can you take a look at the codes that I have attached. It's works great, but it only trades once per day and after a certain hour. Can you manipulate the codes so that it will trade continuously as long as the market is open. Tell me what you think. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Yes, I noticed that CriticTrades doesn’t update after a martingale is closed from broker’s server. That happens when TrailingProfit is enabled, or if it is closed manually from another computer (as I did some time before). I wasn't sure it was a problem. Thanks for the confirmation. I’m going to work on it this weekend and try to improve order's error handling too. Thanks Rama

I have just downloaded it. I'm going to see it. Thanks Rama

Cool, let me know if you need anything else ... and keep us up to date on it ... thanks

Hi all.... i kind of like the trading idea..but have you thought about. trying to use one of the other systems for entrance..some are pretty ok. ofcourse one have to be patience and wait for entrance,but i guess. you will have a much higher rate to hit the trend first time.. instead of going in and out many times a day....

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks Rama! Yes I use the TrailingProfit option. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Thank Rama for info about EmergencyClose / TrailingProfit / TrailingStop / SecureProfit Regards Ps: I send to u a pvt msg. Please take a look.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Here is a fixed new version. Bugs fixed: Assure CriticTrade value update. Problem mentioned by Xaron on post #292. Use normalized prices. Before this correction enter price could be 1.5593015, and order wouldn’t be executed at 1.5593, but at 1.5594. That’s why some times difference between orders in martingale is bigger than PipsStep. Confirm new order executed properly, specially SELL ones before trading variables values are updated. There was a “&gt;=” symbol instead a “&gt;” on short position. Set default colors for chart background and information labels. Improves: More information in log file, i.e. closing and modifying orders. Yellow line drawn at bid price equivalent of next enter price. SecureProfit is executed beginning from order number OrdenSalto, instead of the first one. Trader can reduce secure profit percentage because it doesn’t works from the beginning. StopLoss parameter customizes stop loss level when TrailingStop is enabled. It could be positive or negative. And it is set from last order entered remaining open. MagicHedge identifies the magic number current one is hedging. This is when EA is used in two charts of the same pair and timeframe, one only sell, the other one only buy. When semaphore CriticTrade is on, the hedged EA continues trading as if semaphore was off. Version 3.32 has time trading period. But I don’t feel comfortable with its code. I hope this helps. Kind regards. Rama

Tried backtest it. Got error: 2008.04.26 21:03:28 2008.04.17 00:50 MA Martingale v3.33 GBPUSD,M5: dll calls are not allowed; 'user32.dll'-'GetDC' 2008.04.26 21:03:28 2008.04.17 00:50 MA Martingale v3.33 GBPUSD,M5: expert stopped

Thanks Rama! jasius: You have to allow the import of dll's for the EA. I've attached the compiled version of the EA... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi, I've attached the presets I use. Currently I use the EA for GBP/USD, GBP/JPY and USD/JPY (all 30m charts). Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi Xaron You're a fantastic EA improver http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif You're working even on Sundays ! Regards

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thanks mad! But I haven't improved anything, it was Rama. I've just compiled the new version. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I see. But how do you do that for testing purposes? Also, do you both buy and sell in your preset pairs? Tried frames other than 30 min? Using normal, mini or micro lots? Do you run those 24/7? Oh, I see. you go both loing and short and those are mini lots. Wiat, is that 0.1 lot? So something like ODL would work...

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Appreciate your effort, the exe file works for me finally nothing else worked. Tks

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Xaron, doesn't seem to trade on Alpari with all dll's and live trading enabled. It didn't open a single order today on USDJPY

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Works great for me. It may take some time until the EA starts a sequence. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #313 ---
me too, no trade on usd/jpy but 1 trade on usd/gbp

--- 帖子 #314 ---
It started working today

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I've stopped the EA yesterday and made a stupid mistake by closing a sequence. Did cost me 50€. This month was another good one. I've attached my statement. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Good job, Xaron Please could you remind your settings and version ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Thanks, I use the latest version 3.33. My settings are these ones: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=306 I use the pairs GBP/USD, GBP/JPY and USD/JPY with 30m charts. I always start with 0.01 lots in my 3,000€ account. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Xaron There is a curious thing in your statement about the sequence usdjpy april 2. After a sell 1.92 at 101.92, the following sell 2.85 is at 101.54 and the following 5.84 at 101.85 ????? It's not the normal progression. Any idea ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Yes, this was a bug of the EA. Just look back a few pages, I asked Rama about it. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hmmm ...dangerous in live at this level ! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon8.gif

--- 帖子 #321 ---
The whole strategy is dangerous itself. There will be a margin call sooner or later, that's for sure. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I did not talk about the strategy but about the bug http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif Regards.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
That's the reason I use the TrailingProfit now. That way this bug doesn't appear. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Here is my bug description: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=228 Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Is that the live account you're trading? With that kind of profit you will gain your 3000 in no time and then everything will run in profit, so you can get your margin call. I'll try it for several months on demo and if it shows that I recover my original amount in several months then I'll just go live

--- 帖子 #328 ---
That's my plan, yes. Currently I've taken out about 1,500. So even if I get a margin call I should be almost break even then... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #329 ---
With Martingale, it's wise to take the profits out of your funds asap before the margin call does ....

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Could anybody explain why EA sold 5 times in a row instead of reversing?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I think that's the way the EA is designed to work, right ???

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I think that it has to reverse when it's in loss and double the counts?.. WHy would it keep on opening when in loss?... Maybe creator of EA could shed some light? Has that happened to anybody else?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Excellent work Xaron. I have started trading on your style: initial lot size helps to avoid risk too much. I finished 20% up too. And I recovered from my margin call of march 18. Every time i touch automatic trades i make a mistake too. The best part is that system works most time completely lonely. Good luck, and better trades for next month. Rama

--- 帖子 #334 ---
This is the basis of any martingale, keep on the same way until market retrace. That's why you need an initial lot size small, and reasonable FactorLot (1.5 to 2.1). Rama

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Did you or Xaron get margin call as well? I am using Xaron's templates...

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Rama, can you make it open subsequent trades in the opposite direction ... just like the Martingale stop-and-reverse? It might prove to be more profitable, especially in trending condition ...

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Xaron templates are good enough, because they use small initial lot size. Running on several pairs increase profits. About MC, i posted my real statement on 03/18/08. It occurred because I set an initial lot size of 0.03 on GPBUSD on a 1.3k balance account. And simultaneously there was another martingale opened on USDJPY. TradeCriticQtty parameter born from this MC. So it is a very important tool to keep you on the road. Look for that post. I don't know remember wich is it number. Search by date= March 18 on the forum. If i had closed the martingale on USDJPY with 2 orders opened at breakeven, there would have been enough margin to resist until GBPUSD retrace, 30 minutes later MC. That was a lesson. Rama

--- 帖子 #338 ---
So you didn't get margin call yesterday when it started selling USDGBP? Strange... I wonder if Xaron got it... I'll see if TradeCriticQtty is enabled in his templates

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I didn't use the EA yesterday because I stop it on days where very important news come up like FED interest rate decisions. I've started it right now. I use a initial lot size of 0.01 in a 3,000€ account, that should be safe. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I see. I probably should do the same thing, then

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Yeah... I've done alot of backtesting so far it seems like 0.01 lot sizes are the only way that the backtest has prevented a margin call. So far.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Rama and Xaron, what levergaes are you using since my margin call yesterday came starting with 0.01 lots

--- 帖子 #343 ---
maybe u should try 1:500. IMO

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I really don't know why I am answering this kind of posts. I feel I'm trying to convince you about MAM quality. Let's think for a while you are making an effort to understand the system. So here I upload my real account daily statement. I hope this help you. If you have a point to mention, please just do it. It will contribute with EA improvement. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Rama, you are not obliged to answer my questions. But if you do, please try to avoid remarks such as "these types of questions". Since you are missing a valid point here, I'll try to elaborate: I got margin call with the same EA with the same settings as Xaron uses with 0.01 lots, whereas nobody else did (Xaron was offline, but I don't believe his settings are very much different from others). So actually I am contributing to the reproducibility of this EA by raising this question. Again, you should choose if you want to answer it. BTW, I appreciate your work and publishing the EA regards

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Why don't you simply post the statement of your margin call, the parameters file set and both log files (trading terminal + EA). That is the information necessary to understand what had happened, and your contribution. Rama

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Dear Rama and Xaron.. i'm sorry maybe this is silly question, i attached last report/statement from u both (post 315-Xaron statement and post 344-Rama statement) both from live account. just one thing make me confuse, this's state that Xaron use initial lot almost 10x than Rama, 1. Xaron used for initial lot $0,1 per pips--intial deposit $3000 (and can avoid mc) 2. Rama used $0.01 per pips-deposit aprrox $1000 (have been get mc) how can it be? (sorry for poor english)

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I use 0.01 pips as starting lot size as well. 0.1 is way to high to survive with such a small account. Where do you see that I use 0.1 in my statement? BTW: My account is 3,000 EUR, that's more than $4,500... That should add another "safety". Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #349 ---
i mean 0.01 lot that equal $0,1 per pip in ur account this quit different with Rama (0.01 lot equal $0.01). isn't right?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
No it isn't. 0.01 lot means 1000 units of the first currency of the pair. So 0.01 lot for the EUR/USD means 1000 units of EUR. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi Xaron, i think what pipsuffer want means, it´s Alpari doesn´t use MicroLots like InterbankFx. At interbank, each pip was = +/- $0.01, trade pennys not dimmes. But i´m feeling we don´t need this discussion. The problem or the solution, was each very small change in EA settings can make the hole difference, so, if u put trademax to 8 or 9, can be the difference to get a MC of get a high profit. If u change the others options was the same; trade reverse, only 1 pip at TP and STEP can be the line from MC and Profits.. so, small changes big changes. Don´t have EA running with almost same settings. It is EA runnig with SAME or OTHER settings. Have all a nice weekend! Regards Numeral

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi Rama, did you get a chance to look at that stop-and-reverse code ?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I receive this mail, so i´m resending.. Damning truth about IBFX [ ALL LINKS HAVE BEEN REMOVED, PLEASE CONTACT THE AUTHOR FOR DETAILS - Scott Kuehne &lt; scottdavidkuehne@... &gt;] I don't know how many of you are aware of the infamous Robert Grey's connection to IBFX or how many of you are currently subscribed to this thread by "forex saviour" but it is very informative and often entertaining considering the author's literary style. Not that bucketshop FX dealers are any laughing matter but this thread will keep you informed on all the low down operators out there. Here is the post he wrote about Robert Grey and "Interbank" FX. Dirty Rotten Scoundrel- Part II When last we left off Robert Gray was busy handing over the financial records of a shady managed funds firm operating under his nose at GFS to government prosecutors. As the court document described GFS was clearing its trades through Interbank FX. The marriage between Gray and IBFX then became fully consummated in 2005. In March of that year according to the NFA Gray applied to be a Principal with Interbank FX. No telling if he ran over to IBFX with all GFS' clients but in any case he appears to have officially stayed at IBFX for about six months. Unofficially? This is where things get very murky. Gray withdrew his license with IBFX on October 1, 2005 and applied for a new one with a newly created FCM, Forex Liquidity, on October 28, 2005. It was at FXLQ where Gray would cook up his piece de resistance, concocting an imaginary $35 million bond out of thin air and using that to pad FXLQ's official adjusted net capital number. I won't rehash the collapse of FXLQ again but if you would like a full recap feel free to go here: While Gray officially cut his ties to IBFX in 2005 there was still a business relationship between the two as evidenced by the fact that FXLQ was a prime provider of liquidity to IBFX. A debate has risen on the bulletin boards as to how dependent IBFX was on FXLQ in providing it with liquidity. In particular one dubious poster on FX Street claims IBFX for a long time was merely a white label of FXLQ and was somehow bound to Robert Gray for life: From: Dan Campbell, Pipland, USA Date of Post: 2007-12-05 Review: I've been trying to warn folks for over 2 years now (read my threads below, I used to work there), but justice is finally being servered, "to some degree". Forex Liquidity (FXLQ) is finally under investigation from the NFA. To recap: InterbankFX (IBFX) is a white label of FXLQ. Hense they are able to say "no dealing desk". Because in fact "IBFX" does not have a dealing, but rather it's at FXLQ where all IBFX customers clear their trades... Sadly, as with most NFA "investigations", nothing will be done, but this should be a hugh warning bell for everyone using IBFX. Following the bread crumbs folks... The white label charge comes off as a bit of conspiracy mongering on the part of this Dan Campbell as IBFX continues to operate for the most part without incident even as FXLQ has been shut down. But it does beg the question how on earth did Robert Gray accrue so much influence in this industry? Gray has been linked to numerous firms from FXDD, to Spencer Financial to Velocity FX. Google him and his name appears all over the bulletin boards like a plague bacillus. So deep is his influence that he even pops up in China heading up another fx brokerage called MultiBank FX (great mugshot of Gary on page 7): And while IBFX may still be up and running their relationship with Robert Gray has cost them dearly as FXLQ owes Interbank over $10 million in frozen assets according to FXLQ's own Receiver: It's my hope that the new NFA Capital Requirement increase to $5 million will help weed out the Robert Grays of the FX World. Gray flourished in the weeds of the industry at small firms that never seemed to get the NFA's attention. But with the industry reduced to 24 domestic firms and with new rules set to require all Introducing Brokers be licensed his time will have come and gone and none too soon. I read at one of these links that Robert Gray has an Irish passport and that if things ever get too rough he can always hop on Aer Lingus and live out his days shepherding sheep on a quiet farm outside Galway. Well, should that day come I'm sure the forex trading community will sing in unison: Oh Robbie Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen, and down the mountainside. The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying. 'Tis you, 'tis you must go and we gladly say goodbye. But come ye not back when summer's in the meadow Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow, 'Tis we'll dread you be there in sunshine or in shadow. Oh Robbie Boy, Oh Robbie Boy, we loathe you so... --------------------------------- Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo! Mobile. Try it now.

I can see 2 problems: 1. The first one on your data quality. This may not affect the test, but you won’t have a modelling quality result. It will be a n/a value. Try to re-download data from your broker, or use Alpari history center for longer periods. 2. The second one is this: 08:26:35 2008.04.08 08:30 MA Martingale v3[1].33 EURJPYm,M15: dll calls are not allowed; 'user32.dll'-'GetDC'08:26:35 You need allow dll calls from Experts Advisor setting (press F7), “Common” Tab, Safety label, enable “Allow DLL imports” and disable “Confirm DLL function calls” to avoid frequent question confirmations. You can do this last from Tools\Options\Expert Advisor tab. Try these and good luck. Rama.

RAMA, It worked!! Thanks a lot. RAMA, Do you know RAMA is the name for mythical HINDU GOD? What you are doing here is great! You are willing to share your knowledge which many people are not keen to do so!! Seriously I would like to ask your opinion. Do you really think there could be a system where we can profit consistantly in fx? Can we make a good living by just trading online? Is this all really possible? Thanks and regards, vjgeet

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Just a note to all. This EA WILL create a margin call sooner or later. It's a must. The only question is: How much you can take out before it might happen? That's my plan. I'll take out the wins every month up to the point where I'm at break even. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hope you guys can keep your winnings or losing updated since this would help us to know how this system may benefit. Xaron, Thanks for your advise. Please do share with us how if any we can actually make constant profit in forex. What would be your advise or tips? Thanks a lot. Regards, vjgeet

--- 帖子 #371 ---
My advise for consistent profits: Don't use any martingale systems. This one might work for some time. You have to trade as small as possible. Don't make Forex trading too complicated. I don't like indicators at all, I just use some moving averages. Check out Phil's 5m scalping thread . It's (for me) the best strategy. Should work in other timeframes, too. It's just buying in pullbacks in trends... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #372 ---
This is a very important clue not setted on EA. It belongs exclusive to the trader.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Thanks for your words. Do you know what is a devil? Is an EA developer that produced a margin call. Rama

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hello.. How much ur starting capital using this EA, and when or how much exactly u take the profit?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Dude!! Agree with ya! So, bro... which version currently you use? P/s : sorry for my real bad english.. Its drop my mojo... hehe

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I use 3,000 Euro and start with 0.01 lots. I plan to use 0.01 lots (as starting size) for every 2,000 Euro in the account which should be about 0.01 lots for every $3,000. Just look at my presets, I've posted them in this thread. These presets are almost the same as Rama has used... Regards - Xaron

martingel called margin your account in just 1 day even you make profit in 1 year please dont try it

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Yes. You are completely rigth. It is needed less than 1 day for a margin call. That's why you must follow an strategic money management as Xaron do, and isn't setted on the EA. Be carefull. Rama

--- 帖子 #382 ---
There are a couple of problems: 1) Log file shows that you started and stopped EA execution too frequent. As MT4 people advise: the EA remains working a few seconds before you stop it. And if you restart it immediately this could cause some execution mistakes. Notice that EA must check opened orders, and variables values. This takes time. 2) The text “trade is not allowed” means the expert is not allowed to trade or a thread for trading is occupied. You could be connected to your broker, but trading context may be busy. Or you may disabled EA pressing the bottom on your tool bar. 3) So when the EA has detected an opened order, it tried to open the next, but context was busy. So retry 4 more times before give up. During this time EA looks like hanged. If you don’t let it run, and restart the execution, all process will restart again. Do you see a smiley face on top right corner of the chart you are trading? If don’t, then you must allow EA execution. If it worked before, I don’t see any other reason to stop working. I’m running it too, and didn’t see this kind of problems. Verify if you are connected and you are allowed to trade. Good luck. Rama

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Thx for reply.. Yes, i already verify there is a smiley face right top on the chart but its still wont make any new post. Its been 4 day and not make ane new post. Should i remove back the EA and put it back? Or maybe should i reinstall back?

Hi my friends. I miss u guys, the thread was too quiet! I´m very happy with Rama EA results. I will put a kind of hedge with Rama EA at my newest account (i win at 3rd place the ForexCup: $500 in pocket) So i stop some tests with all pairs, they give me nice results at demo accounts, 6-7% per month. I just need to make some manual trade to stop or hedge the bad trades. So, about that: Improves: MagicHedge identifies the magic number current one is hedging. This is when EA is used in two charts of the same pair and timeframe, one only sell, the other one only buy. When semaphore CriticTrade is on, the hedged EA continues trading as if semaphore was off. Please Rama, what is the difference from only change the MagicNumber to allow it buy and sell at same time (2 charts) and the MagicHedge? How i use the MagicHedge? I need to put =1 ? edit: i´m already using the EA buying and selling the same pair, but i don´t know exactly what is the diference. Thanks a lot. Best Regards, Numeral

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I tested for 3 weeks with 3 pairs, starts from 0.01 lot (mini account) with 3000USD balance. 1 week: $5.20 2 week: $4.97 3 week: $5.01 (few hours to go) it will give me 1200/year very stable income I use max trade = 9 , pipstep32 , tp34. The largest trade is 8/9.

Hi Numeral: I visited ForexCup web page and there it is your name at the top five best traders. Good work. That contest starts only when 1000 traders apply for it. So this means very good news. About hedging bad trades, I was making the same on my real account. Trying new settings on EURJPY I fall in troubles – again – a week ago. I solved the 400 pips drawdown, hedging the half of the total martingale lot size. After additional 60 pips down, I closed the hedge position in profit, giving me the necessary margin to open manually the 10th martingale's order when I see market retracing. Closing all with $157 profit. As always happens, if I would have enough balls to keep riding that 10th position, retrace was 240 pips long. But how can anybody keep 10.23 lots on a mini account? About MAGICHEDGE parameter: Semaphore red light switches on when one of your EAs reaches CriticTrades quantity, showing it Magic Number. This functionality makes stop trading the other EAs running on the same terminal. Freeing balance to the EA in trouble. Many often there are new trading signals in the opposite direction of your martingale when CriticTrades is reached. That’s why you run the EAs on separate charts, one only buy, the other only sell. But there will be a problem: semaphore is on because you have an EA that switched on the red light. These may stop all new trading on other EAs. To allow trading on a particular EA when semaphore is on, you need set parameter MagicHedge with the Magic Number of the EA that switched on the semaphore red light. The only one you may do that is the pair you can hedge. Finally this is an example how you must set parameters I tried to explain, and I neither can’t understand what I worte: PAIR TF TRADELONG TRADESHORT MAGIC MAGICHEDGE GU 30m true false 1000 1111 GU 30m false true 1111 1000 Best regards Rama

Rama, hanks for help. -/- I find one thread (from linvest) about one comercial EA.. so i start to looking how it work, its a martingale with goes on both sides (buy/sell). The ea has almost 2 months of demo account and have 230% of profits. The account was at FXOpen: &gt; Login : 89408 &gt; pass : mafm0nk ODL: &gt; Login : 235993 &gt; Password : 4ppiizl Automaticaly open new order when tp reached. use: G/U and U/J I´m sharing for study propose. Regards

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Rama, just an idea: could you implement fixed percentage risk instead of fixed lots as an option?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
It’s the same as running MA Martingale EA on two charts. One only buy (TradeShort = false), and the other one only sell (TradeLong = false). And with fixed values on ForceTrade. Cero on long chart, and one on short chart (ForceTrade = 0/1). I back tested this, on one side only, and it shows very fast grow. But it call margin too soon. Is really dangerous. Don’t use it on real accounts, until you find a suitable setting. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #398 ---
If you set parameter “mm= true” EA will use percentage set on parameter “Risk”. InitialFixedLot is for ensure a minimum initial lot size when mm=true, and a fixed lot size when mm=false. Rama

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Exactly. Can work in this way. Just need to find a good setting to work without (less) risk. with 30/30 only Buy with maxtrade=9 and tradecritic=8 with 5k, we reach 12k from 2004.06 to 2008.01. But with 81.9% of DD. (Only Sell doesn´t work fine like Only Buy) Regards

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Could any of you gents clarify: I've been runing this EA for a month now on Alpari with fixed lots 0.01 to start. I thought that was mini account, since, for example, ODL, doesn't allow anything less than 0.1. So if I wanted to go with real mini account (say in IBFX), I should open mini account (where all the currencies have letter 'm' to them), and then 0.01 lots would be mini lots, e.g. not the same amount as in my current Alpari? Never understood that, have read everything about mini accounts but still don't get it

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi, just a small update from me. Everything is fine so far. I've closed a GBP/USD short grid in the 6th level manually with a loss of about 3% because of important news ahead. Didn't want to get margin called. It would have worked, the 8th level would had been closed, but that's ok for me. Currently I'm up about 12% this month. Will post my statement again by the end of this month. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Jasius: About fixed lots, I don’t know if you understand how to use lots as balance percentage. But I recommend make your math on a spreadsheet before, to check how much draw down your settings could resist before margin call. Your initial lot size depends on your strategic money management. This include all the pairs you are trading simultaneously. I use the EA on 5 pairs. So I must leave free balance to let the other EAs get closed. On this thread is an excel file with some examples can help you. It sounds nice a lots size set by percentage, but you may do some work too. About the little “m” IBFX place on their charts on mini accounts, it doesn’t care. EA works fine. In fact, I’m using this broker and account type. This is the calc done for lot size: Balance * Risk / Contract Size. I.e. 1200 * 0,13 / 10000 = 0.0156. Then rounded to 0.02 lots. Why are you leaving Alpari? Did you run the EA on real with Alpari? Rama

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I understand MM. All I need is to use real mini account live where I won't rack so much profit but would have much less chance of margin call. Currently I am ~25% a month up. I'd rather have less profit... My question is that somebody had $5 a week. I would like to get that combined with MM feature. Alpari is not life account. Also I am in US so I want to use US broker (mini) to go life

--- 帖子 #405 ---
which mini broker you use? one pip in my Alpari account GBPUSD is worth $0.1 (0.1 lots). Is that mini?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Jasius: Download "presets.zip" file uploaded by Xaron on last april. They are very good settings for a conservartive trading style on mini accounts. I'm using IBFX mini account with those settings, with some changes. Pairs traded: EURJPY, GBPJPY, GBPUSD, USDCHF and USDJPY. I founded a good setting for NZDUSD but the martingale last too much time. My actual daily average is 12,77. But this month I added a deposit to reach a 2k balance account. Rama

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I've been trading Xaron's settings for more than a month now. Got $577 in a month, obviously it's not mini account, but I want to go mini and, possibly, live. Can EURJPY and USDCHF be run on the same settings? Do you want to share them for those two pairs?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Can your EA be back tested for optimization purposes? I tried but optimizer can't load it, must have something to do with dll's

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Here you are Jasius.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Yes, EA can be back tested and optimizated. Here is a back test on NZD USD optimizated. Don't trust on MT4 optimization. It's better use a spreadsheet and watch your charts for optimization. When balance grows before increase initial lot size, I increase FactorLot. I use to balance margin usage manually, by setting parameters initial lot size and factor lot. Don't let the EA do all the work all the time. Just an opinion. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Thanks. I will go with ~5 pairs on mini, instead of racking up 40% a month with three pairs on normal account, as this is dangerous

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi all, here comes my statement from may. Made about 15%. Would had been more if I hadn't closed 3 positions manually with a small loss (overall -3%). But I wanted to do a save play. That's now my 3rd month using this EA in my 3,000€ live account and it's doing great. I still await a margin call which will come sooner or later but for now I wouldn't lose anything then, because I've withdrawed enough now. Regards - Xaron edit: I've added my detailed statement for the last 3 month. Please not that the pullbacks in the equity curve come from my withdrawals.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Xaron would u mind to post ur expert setting n pair u trade. latest i know that u trade only gbp/jpy, gbp/usd, and usd/jpy all in 30m chart n use trailing stop, isn'it? from your statement, there is eur/jpy trade too.. sorry if i'm bothering u thx pips

--- 帖子 #414 ---
My settings are here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=306 Still the same from last month. I trade only GBP/USD, GBP/JPY and USD/JPY (30m charts), all with initial size of 0.01 lots. Maybe I tried something different with the EJ, can't remember it, must had happened in march or april, where I did more testing. Might be opened during an accident with another EA. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #415 ---
thx for quick answer.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Xaron, before I thought you were using mini account, but then you wouldn't have made 15% on 3000 account. Yet, your presets have mini=true enabled. Could you shed some light? BTW, I got 30% in April using you settings on Alpari. I want to switch to US based broker and was wondering about this mini thing

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Why not? I use a lot size of 0.01 lot. That's always 1000 units of the base currency. And I have a 3,000€ account which is about $4,500. Maybe that's the difference? Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Is that mini or not?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Actually I don't know. 0.01 lots are 1,000 units. So if I go long in the EUR/USD at 1.5000 and sell at 1.5100 with 0.01 lot I'll win $10. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #420 ---
got it. I assume in alpari it doesn't matter as 0.01 lots are allowed, which is 1/100 lots. on IBFX one has to open mini account. But then I am confused if mini means by default that 1 lot mini=0.01 lot normal account. Yet, we go 0.01 lots on mini, so in fact we are going 0.0001 accounts. BUt I guess that reasoning is worng, mini means only that 0.01 is enabled, as opposed to something like ODL where lowest amount is 0.1

--- 帖子 #421 ---
The most important thing is that broker you’ll choose must offer fractions on the full lot. This means: 0.01, 0.07, 0.12, 0.18, 1.13. If not martingale logic is broken and your account will be blown up. There are many brokers that minimum lot is 0.01, but they use a step on bigger lots of 0,05 (0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 … and so on). With them you can't place an order with 0.02, or 1.16 lots. You can use this EA on standard accounts. Rama

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Good point. Obviously, Alpari and IBFX are two of them

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Question: why did it open two trades with 0.16 lots at the same time?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yep. The same had happened to me. Not the first time BTW. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #425 ---
One more question is, why didn't critical trade mode start on either GBPUSD or USDJPY when 4 trade was taken

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Because critic trade just disables starting new martingales, it doesn’t close opened ones. The current opened martingales continue its normal way until they get closed, or trader closes them manually. Rama

--- 帖子 #427 ---
What does “Comment” says? Or better, what does log file says? Which number in the martingale did they have? I’m not having that trouble. Rama

--- 帖子 #428 ---
got it

--- 帖子 #429 ---
There you go

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I really don’t understand what happened. What I could see is that Stdlib reloaded at 2008.06.22 02:28:55, exactly the same time the first order was entered. This library is used by EA to inform the literal name of an error occurred. If the call for an imported function failed the expert stops working. The reload means the EA restarted. This error happened to me (today for example on GBPJPY), but luckily it never opened two equal orders. I really don’t know what could happened. I think to code something to check if the trading buffer is clean before send a new order. But really don't understand what had happened. Sorry, mean while, don’t leave alone your orders too much time. If somebody in this forum could explain why a library is reloaded during EA execution, will be helpful. Regards Rama

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Don't know what you mean? Yes, yesterday was scary, the EA went through all 9 progression levels in the GBP/USD. The DD was about 50% in my account. I decided to close the grid in a pullback and took a loss of about 5% (still 2% up this month). This would not had been necessary again, as the tp level was reached after that... And yes: The day will come where a margin call will happen. That's not a fault of the EA but of all kind of martingale systems. Regards - Xaron

I always do. So yes, even with a margin call I would be in the winning zone. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi all, here comes my statement from june. Again this was a very good month. There was once a dangerous situation where I decided to take a loss of 5% to avoid a possible margin call. After all this would not had been necessary again, but it's ok. In june I made about 8% (including the 5% loss, so it would be around 13-15% without my intervention) Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Nice Proftis Xaron, congrats! So, if u continue with manual trades closing bad ones, do u still belive u will get a margin call? Even when u have more than +500 pips free to lose? I think with EA + manual trading can avoid margin call, just need good manage of maximum open orders.. Regards Numeral

--- 帖子 #437 ---
hi all, also finished my first month live trading. 14% up, using MM similar to Xaron. I just didn t close manually the largr martingale series of gpd/usd of june 20. The profits are quite consistent. The issue seems to be always the same: when will we get margin call, or how to avoid it trying to avoid manual tradind as much as possible. regards

--- 帖子 #438 ---
anyone using this live on a US broker? if so which ones? thanks

--- 帖子 #439 ---
someone want to explain to me why people say martingale systems fail. i mean we all now that price has to break out have a channel at some point, i mean so much of trading is playing off of s and r levels, and the longer the levels hold the greater the break of that level will be. i am relating this to a ranging market with martingale strategy. if you manage your account, and only risk a low amount of capital at first, and understand a pair, i dont see why you wouldnt be able to produce an easy 10% a month, risking a starting amount of .5/1% per trade. i dont think it is the most profitable strategy by far, but can someone explain to me why its terrible. someone enlighten me please, i read this all over

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I didn't read the entire thread, so please forgive me if something was mentioned here that I'm unaware about. However, I did spend a bunch of time messing around with systems like this one and the main issue with it is that you simply run out of money in your account. For some reason, it always seems to new traders like this is a very simple thing, you just start out with very low lots and you should be fine. So I just made up a quick table of how quickly the lots double even if you start out with .01: # Lots 1 0.01 2 0.02 3 0.04 4 0.08 5 0.16 6 0.32 7 0.64 8 1.28 9 2.56 10 5.12 11 10.24 12 20.48 13 40.96 14 81.92 15 163.84 16 327.68 17 655.36 18 1310.72 19 2621.44 20 5242.88 Of course you may say that you will never reach trade #20, but believe me it happens, and even if you don't can you afford trade #10? Probably not, because you just lost 9 trades before this one. The other problem with these systems is that if you protect yourself really well (say you have enough capital to go up to 20 trades) the profits are so small that it becomes not worth the play. You would probably make more money by simply putting all of that capital into a good savings account. So, what do people end up doing? They end up overleveraging in order to make these profits worth something, so we often see comments like "Made 10% last month, but nearly avoided a Margin Call". All I have to say to that is that the Margin Call is coming, you can trust me on that. Unfortunatelly I'm speaking from my own experience. Hopefully this will save you some money and a ton of stress. There are much better systems out there. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
There is no (automated) way to avoid a margin call using this method like any other martingale method. The market is always right and there will be times where the market just goes away in one direction or just ranges too long (if you use a stop and reverse system). I'm up about 14% this month. Will post my statements tomorrow. I've stopped the EA now after the bad US news and closed some open positions with a small loss of less than 1%. I've withdrawn some money again and now I'm in the lucky condition to be in the plus even with a future margin call. I've started this method with €3.000 in march and have made a profit of exactly €3.045,39 since then. So I doubled my account using this EA in 5 month. The maximum drawdown was about 21% (=800 Euro). Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #442 ---
So here comes my statement for July. As I'm now in the plus zone, I'll change the initial lot size from 0.01 to 0.02. That doesn't sound very much but will double the gain as well as the risk for a MC. I dropped the GBP/JPY and will only use GBP/USD and USD/JPY now. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Excellent results, Xaron. I know your settings but what version do you use ? 3.00 or 3.33 ? Regards.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
The latest one, V3.33 Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Missed that question, sorry: The thing is: You don't have +500 pips free to lose. If the last level has been entered (2.56 or 5.12 lots) it only takes 20 - 30 pips to wipe your account. Just think about that 2.56 lots mean that every pips is worth about $256! Regards - Xaron

Yes, I dropped it. But for the GJ the settings were slightly different - larger spacing. You can find my settings somewhere in the thread. Currently I use only GBP/USD and USD/JPY (which creates sometimes something like a synthetic GBP/JPY). This month was the best so far, I'm up about 30%!! jasius: You will get margin calls using this system. That's the reason I always withdraw some of the money... Regards - Xaron

Hello everybody, up to now I only read the thread, and I found it very impressive. The EA is very impressive to me, not only for the system but also for the coding. Congratulation, especially to rama and thanks to Xaron for the good setups. I let the system run since last friday morning (with rest over the weekend), and I have a performance of about 17%, which is of course very good. Well, if you like i would like to discuss a possible improvement of the system to handle the "death trade", margin call or whatever you like to say. The ideas are influenced by other threads on ff which are dealing with martingale systems as well. The idea is to "manage" the margin call and not to fear the margin call and to look at it like the rabbit to the snake. If I understand the thread correctly (reports from xaron)as well as some backtests show, it is reasonable to get 30% performance per month with a probalitity of one margin call per year (please correct me if I'm wrong). Thus, what about to look for maybe ten currency pairs, mostly not correlated, run them separatly and give them explicitly stop loss in order to avoid a margin call. The stop loss is calculated that the risk is 10% of the equity (which should be equivalent to a margin call with an account which is 1/10 of the original). I will say to this death trade "margin call" with brackets beacause it is not any longer a margin call. You will lost about 10% of your equity. Thus, in a month without a dead thread you make your 30%. In a month with a "margin call" in one currency pair you would make about (30% - the lost due to the "margin call" = 10%) 20%. You should suffer from about 12 "margin calls" per year, but you have managed it. I hope you got the idea, and I do not have made an error. With regards, GuHu

You can't do this manually - you have to sleep. You could code this into the API of course... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #465 ---
GuHu: Welcome. Good points, maybe there is a solution... 30% per month might be a little bit too high - 10-20% in average are possible, 1 MC per year might be true as well but one could get of course 3 margin calls in a month one after each other - noone knows. The problem with a stop of 10% is just that I'm more than once per month in the red (net asset value) more than these 10%... Will have to check this... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hello Xaron, thank you for the welcome ! 30% per month is not necessary, necessary is a positive expectancy overall and that should be there. Then it doesn't matter wether there are 3 mc in a month or none. The suggested improvement smoothes out the equity curve. The stop loss should not be 10% but calculated as follows: Let's have a look at your setup. As I understand you correctly, you trade with 2.000 Euros and a initiallotsize of 0.02. If you start a martingale cycle in your current setup with an equity of 2000 euros with for an example 9 Maxtrades, you can immediatly calculate the price where your account blow up. This price will be the stop loss prize. Then you can increase your account to 20.000 Euros and trade 10 currency pairs together. (it will be impossible to find 10 pairs, 5 will be better as well). The impact of such a "margin call" in one currency pair will be reduced significantly. GuHu

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Ah now I got it. That way you would make about 2-3% per month (not that bad with 20k) but will lose 10% in case of a "simulated margin call". You could create 5-10 subaccounts (no problem with most MT4 market makers) and deposit 2k in each and just let it go... Should be the same. BTW: I use 0.01 lot for every 2k €. But I trade 2 pairs in my (3k) account, with 0.02 lot starting size each (I should use only 0.01, but I've increased my risk, I'll raise to 0.03 lots if I reach 6k in my account, so 0.01 for every 2k). Regards - Xaron

Hi all, Sorry for my bad English, i'm french. My challenge : start with 250€ (min) in ActivTrades because i like this Martingale So, i have backtesting Martin during 6 month and optimized 3 pairs : EUR-USD / USD-JPY and GBP-USD. After it, i have added a send mail function and add the excellent automatic order management Swiss Army ( http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...anagement.html ). I have started Martin the 06 August in real mode with these 3 pairs + SwissArmy. Thank to Rama and Xaron for the big work !!

hi, i ve been using something similar on my demo to hedge the trades in the case the sereies climb to much (floating pl &gt;20%, for example), but i am not sure which are the best settings to set the Swiss Army EA. Wich parameters are you using? i could not see orders managed by Swiss Army EA in your report. Thanks

Hi pstrader, I just use the MaxLoss_Dollar parameter.

Hello Straasha, Those are impressve results, can you tell us what are your settings in the martingale Baggio andd the swiss army . I would like try testing it. Tks

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Ok Thanks for your answer. And how are you managing the tradees .... hedging?, closing?

Swiss army is use just for close all open orders when MaxLossDollar = xxx $ Please find my settings :

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Straasha, Thank you for the settings, but tell me what your setting is for Swiss Army for max losses? Also what version are you using, some of the settings in VS3.3 don't include some options that you have in your set file. Tks :-)

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi Straasha, thank you very much for sharing your work. I do not understand your backtest. Do you have backtested a period of 6 months or do you have worked 6 months on your backtest? A period of 6 months for backtesting is much too short for a martingale system! It is dangerous. I have backtested your parameters sincd 01/2004 and not all of them showed a profit. If you do not see a death trade in your backtest the period is too short. I do not see the general advantage of the swiss army in comparison with the external parameters already implemented in the system (up to a stop loss). If you limit the drawdown it is a little bit similar to reduce maxtrades. But maybe I misunderstand your approach totally. GuHu

All Martingale systems do not work and the type of hedging that most use in forex is also a loser, combining the above two you might as well just make a donation to your broker because that is basically what you are doing. Martingale does not work stay away from that system.

How is this system doing so far? and especially during very volatile market conditions like we are having this month (October)? Xaron, let us know and please post your statement for October... I am testing this system and nearly had a margin call two weeks ago on USD/JPY. Thanks

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Thanks for all the great work! Xaron and Rama, you are my new idols (it used to be Nelson Mandela). Btw, I'd like to suggest a simple solution to the dreaded MC. The losses which destroy our accounts really occur from the 9th trade. It is truly only the 9th trade which causes the account to blow up in our faces. Have you guys considered limiting maxtrades to 8? If the max trades is 8, the last trade would be 1.28, and the cumulative amount on the table would be simply: 0.01 + 0.02 + 0.04 + 0.08 + 0.16 + 0.32 + 0.64 + 1.28 = 2.55 lots. The weighted average pip loss would be about USD25-26 per pip (Note: I am talking about MetaTrader Pips. The Metatrader Pip is 10 times the size of an Oanda Pip. The definition of "Pip" varies with each broker. They never bothered to standardize it.) Assume pipstep = 40, When the MC is triggered by a 40 pip stop loss on the final trade , the aggregate loss would amount to (0.5*40 + 0.25*80 + 0.125*120 + 0.0625*160 + negligib) * (2.56*USD2.5) = USD 416 . The MC would be painful, but considering the peace of mind it gives, I think it's pretty worth it! Besides, this $5000 account of mine has grown more than $1000 a day on Xaron's and Rama's fantastic settings, with gratefully few MCs to offset the huge earnings (less than 3 per week). And if it seems like I'm getting tonnes of MC's please remember than this MC is comparable to Herpes or Cold Sores, rather than the 9th progression MC, which you could liken to AIDS. While Herpes and Cold sores are painful and more common than AIDS, you will survive them well! On a standard day in these volatile times, I have been trading mildly modified versions of Rama's and Xaron's settings on EURJPY, USDJPY, GBPJPY and Cable 20/5 (I off the system during the overlap between London Markets and US Markets due to the extremely High volatility then.) The $5000 portfolio has grown on average 20% a day for 3 weeks. Will post results and settings soon. On my way to school now. Btw, account has never blown up ever since adjusting maxtrades = 8. What do you guys think of Maxtrades = 8? (OH! And don't forget to disable MM!) Cheers!

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi angchong , wellcome to ForexFactory! I tried Maxtrades = 8 in backtests but doesn't find a profitable setup, that's why I doesnt use it GuHu

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Martingale never works on the long term with reasonable risk and money management. I´d rather recommend to use 10 or 15 trades. Due to the high leverage you make the gains, that you need, so your margin grows above the amount originally risked, so that you will have left more after the trades that causes the margin call. Only that way martingale works, because there will always be a move that crashes your account, so better get it up quickly to be safe once it happens. That´s the black swan of martingale. Knowing that you can make the swan grey, but martingale will never be a system that I would recommend trading. good night

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I agree that it's terribly dangerous. And yeap, that's a great observation! The better the first few trades, the stronger the base. But there are 2 ways of achieving the same risk levels. Assuming we take GBPUSD. Our fear as Martingale users is the event of huge uni-directional moves with poor retracing. For example, If we wish to guard against unidirectional moves of 600 pips, we could use a 9 stage martingale with a 60 point Pipstep (the 600th point on the final progression would wipe you out). Or we could use an 8 stage martingale with a 67 point pipstep. It gives us the same 600 pip risk barrier. Likewise, I could increase my overall survivability by keeping a 9 step martingale, but with a wider Pipstep setting. Taking the earlier example, increasing my pipstep from 60 to 70 on a 9 stage martingale would allow me to survive unidirectional jumps of 700 pips! The problem with this is clearly one of profitability because: 1) Bet sizes would shrink 2) Bet frequencies would drop 3) Since Take Profit must clearly be higher than pipstep, A higher Pipstep means a higher take profit, resulting in less frequent reversions. (might even end up riskier if reversions of a pair have known to be pathetically small!) Of course, the narrow pipstep 9 step martingale is immensely profitable. I make over $1000 a day on a risky 9 step martingale. See the income statement attached below. But the number of times I enter the 9th stage of the Martingale is quite high! (Makes my blood run cold!) Anyway, here are my results for 18 hours of trading on 4 pairs. Essentially, my strategy is to run a hivol version in the daily 4 hours when London and US Markets overlap. That's when we see huge price movements which shock the hell out of us and liquidate our accounts. For the rest of the day, I run Xaron's and Rama's settings. The Hivol version simply doubles the pipstep and takeprofit levels on Xaron's and Rama's settings. (And no offense to anyone, But I think the EURJPY is a death trade. It's got small reversions and huge unidirectional moves. Any Martingale User's worst nightmare. I've dropped it.) And yeap, Dabuschi, I agree that Martingale cannot work passively in the long run. However, by monitoring prevailing volatilities and widening my pipsteps as appropriate, I believe the Martingale is a survivable trade. As you said, 10-15 progressions would be nice, but if I can't achieve such risk protection with sufficient capital, I can surely synthesize it with wider but less profitable pipsteps. Here are my results for 19 hours of trading. 30% up already! I'm extremely new to Metatrader. Used to lose lots by trading Oanda on gut. This system works like a dream Will post more updates soon!

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Sorry, failed to attach. Here it is!

--- 帖子 #488 ---
That´s an approach I thought about and I absolutely agree. Widen your pipsteps and you have a higher probability to survive on the long for the costs of lower return. But that´s the way it is. I´m a trendfollower and doing that I made 100% this week so far trading 5 pairs with 1.5% risk per trade . I use a trailing stop, so it could get more. Worst case I get stopped out and make only +50% . If I would have to choose, I would always use the trendfollowing system. It´s just better for my heart

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi Angconch, nice idea. Since Alpari added a decimal digit to the price recently, you have to multiply the parameters pipstep and takeprofit with 10 in order to get the original behaviour. Congratulation to your first day, but -especially with a martingale system- it does not have enough statistical weight to judge about the system. Could you please post your actual settings and the times you use them? Thanks, GuHu

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi again The account lost $3000+ when the GBP and EUR rebounded after the initial tumbles today! Here are the results. I remember the Sage Xaron telling us to stop the Martingale on interest rate announcement days. Guess I should have listened! Well, still left with $4600 of $5000, so I'd like to ask for help. Today, the 9th progression (2.56) was breached on GBP/USD and USD/CHF. On the GBP/USD, the position liquidated for a $3000 loss almost 400 Alpari Pips (or 40 standard Pips) beyond the last progression level! And my Pipstep was set at 70 Alpari pips (or 7 standard Pips)! This is a really dangerous feature of the current Martingale v3.33. Is there any way to programme an ultimate stoploss which would kick in once we lose more than, say, 70 Alpari pips (7 standard pips) in the final progression? That would cap the aggregate loss on each "death trade" to roughly $700 and make this strategy so much safer. If not, the collapsed position would potentially wipe out the account in a single margin call. Can this reign-in be programmed into the Martingale? Seems like Money Management and trailing stops might achieve the outcome, but do these features work with Martingale? It's disabled in Xaron's templates, but if it helps to avoid such catastrophies, they just might be good. Can someone help? My programming isn't too good yet! Oh, and I'll post my altered presets pretty soon. I can't post the lousy ones I have now. They've failed the test of volatility. Cheers, angchong

--- 帖子 #491 ---
.. here is a version with a stop loss fixed to Maxtrades*Pipsteps relative to Bid/Ask. Thus, after the last level, the system close all positions after Pipsteps again in the wrong direction. The system doesn't trade on friday and around the christmas days. Use it on your own risk. Just my 2 cents: due to the rareness of margin calls you will need a long time for backtests (more than 4 years) to get a significant message.

Dear guys, here are my settings on two pairs. Changes to Xaron's version: 1) Secureprofits set to -0.16. So that the max loss per bad trade is capped at $800. This should leave some small space after the ninth progression. 2) pipstep beefed up to survive hivol periods (note that volatility is much higher than historical! Backtesting is rather futile for now i suspect.) 3) Emergencyclose set to 8. When you hit progression 8, your EA stops trying to hit your Take Profit Level. Instead, it looks only to break even before closing off. This reduces overall profitability from huge windfalls, but sustainability receives a huge boost. You only need a smaller rebound to pull yourself out of a potential death trade 4) mm set to on, risk readjusted such as to keep initial trades at 0.01. That's it for now folks! Use at own risk! In times like these, even a passive EA trader must readjust his pipstep to meet market requirements. Cheers, angchong

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Ahh, Hi Guhu! Was looking for u. Anyway, I found a second way around the atomic bomb issue. Can simply set secureprofits to -0.16. This would leave the 9th progression with about 70 Alpari pips (7 standard pips) to lose before liquidation. More than one way to skin a cat. Btw, as I mentioned earlier, in these times, you might want to consider using wider pipsteps for greater survivability. The Hivol ones I posted are designed to last for much of the day. But theory dies out for 4 hours a day. From the time NY opens to 4 hours after its opening, NY overlaps with London, creating HUGE liquidity from the overlap of the 2 largest Markets. (I'm at GMT +8 btw: London closed about 45 mins ago and NY opened 4hrs 45 mins ago. Hope this helps ) Now running a new simulation. Oh, btw, do remember to KEEP AWAY from Markets whenever an interest rate announcement is impending. Today was a SHOCKER!

Attach swiss army knife (EA available in FF, just search and you ll find it) to another chart with the same pair you re trading. Set swiss army to close position when loss reaches certain amount (e.g. $1000)

Hmm, but two EA's can't work together right? I'm using the M.A Martingale already, and I don't think the Swiss Army can override that can it? Is there a way to program the Max_loss function into the Martingale? Anyone?

Hi all, a small update from me. I still use this EA. I use slightly different settings now, so MaxTrades=8 and a stop loss where the 9th entry would kick in. The sl got hit two times now but I feel more comfortable with it but will check the improvements you've made here. I restarted everything two weeks ago, here are the results so far, beginning with 5k. It's just amazing to make more than 20% in 10 days. That's not normal, but the EA took the unbelievable 2000 pips drop in the cable all the way down... I stopped the EA on friday noon...

Hi guys, Thanks for the advisor and the great work. The expert is really one of the best Martingale strategy I found. So... I found the following problems: When the broker requote some order the expert is confused. The program algorithym stops and any next step is impossible. The only way to solve the problem is to see the error in time and operating manual. The requote can be at hand with the next order in the sequence, or by closing all previeus opened positions. Only the last one is closed by the limit. Please help me to find any decision. Or else I have to change the forex provider (ODL securities at the moment) Sorry for my english. Thank you, Regards Petro

--- 帖子 #515 ---
ODL securities got fined by the NFA for malpractice. Why are you still trading with that crooked Bucketshop? Find yourself a good broker like Xaron did. He uses Alpari, and I've followed his example. If you do microlots, execution time should be negligible since the MM doesn't have to source for liquidity. For small fry transactions like 0.01 lots, they simply take the opposite side of the trade, executing your trade instantly. If ur getting tonnes of requotes, adjust the slippage to at least 4 pips. Seriously, look at their quotes. Damn unprofessional. USDXAU is quoted as GOLD and USDXAG is quoted as Silver. You can trade an unknown substance called OIL; and you can't tell the grade of oil ur trading; whether it's WTI or Brent.

Hi everybody, this is my first time writing on this forum, I find the Baggio Method very good , I did some updates to the entry’s ruels and I’m testing it. I’ve attached the last backtest so you can check it as well. I’m writing to ask a variation to the software, maybe to Rama or anyone able to do it, I’m not good enough to make changes at the deep level . The idea of mine is to change this rule: when the quotation reaches the next step level the software automaticly enable a stop loss to the previews step level. With this behave, the system has a bigger Free Margin and the last step needs less pips to make profit. These are the two new External Variables needed: 1- Set from which step to start the automatic stop loss. 2- Set the number of pips from the nextstep to insert the stop loss. Thank you guys

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Looks like a good idea, I like the backtests .

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Attached there are the original Rama version and the same version reviewed by me . The reviews are only on the entry rules (you can check the program) and is a prerealise. The system is not enough robust to make steady gains, but with the reviews i asked i think this system can become infallible.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Ok i'm going to explain beter the chages i need. Now in the expert the Ma martingale works like this: 1st step at 1.1619 buy 0.1 lots 2nd step at 1.1589 buy 0.2 lots 3rd step at 1.1559 buy 0.4 lots 4th step at 1.1529 buy 0.8 lots and so on In the new version: 1st step at 1.1619 buy 0.1 lots with a stoploss at 1.1589 2nd step at 1.1589 buy 0.2 lots with a stoploss at 1.1559 3rd step at 1.1559 buy 0.4 lots with a stoploss at 1.1529 4th step at 1.1529 buy 0.8 lots with a stoploss at 1.1499 and so on So, in the new version, when the 4th step buy 0.8 lots there are not the loses of the previews steps and the expert have more free margin for eventualy an other step and more if the quotation go in the right direction the last step reached, in this case the 4th, needs less pips for to achieve a gain.

Hello, I am also interested in MAmartingale and the idea of a stop loss between each standpoint is good. I am not a programmer but by arranging the code taken of universum 3 could perhaps solve this problem: losses = 0; double minlot = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_MINLOT); int round = MathAbs(MathLog(minlot) / MathLog(10.0)) + 0.5; double result = lots; int total = OrdersHistoryTotal(); double spread = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_SPREAD); double k = (tp + sl) / (tp - spread); for (int i = 0; i &lt; total; i++) { OrderSelect(i, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_HISTORY); if (OrderSymbol() == Symbol() &amp;&amp; OrderMagicNumber() == mn) { if (OrderProfit() &gt; 0) { result = lots; losses = 0; } else { result = result * k; losses++; } } Regards

No fortune for the martingale stratery type through Alpari UK http://www.alpari.co.uk/en/cnews/show/id/50/ ridiculous decission ?!

--- 帖子 #474 ---
You can run the EA but you will be limited to 2 full lots which is 8 stages but you can adjust certain parameters like grid spacing to compensate. Still it might be a form of protection not go over your limits. It isn't the worse thing. If the grid had 40 pips in each stage you could end up to 320 pips. or you can vary your multiplier to less than 2 X such as 1.6 in which case you can go further. I am personally not a great fan of martingale since it is high risk and you may not want to go over the limit anyways.

Hi everybody: First of all I must say that I blew my account for second time last year, and since then I tried one more time with the same final. My total lost was USD 3.500, plus $30 monthly on the VPS service, necessary to keep running the EA 24 hs. I must assume my own mistakes: I have taken too much risk. And I didn’t see that this trading style doesn’t work on trending markets. The best market conditions are on wide ranging ones or high volatile, such as news days. But on this last market conditions appears another problems: i.e. terminal disconnections, widening spreads , etc. all of them hurting your balance. I also make the big mistake of keep my profits in the account. So if we must consider the true fall of my trading account from the top of the higher balance, this happened from USD 5.500. I have tried too many indicators combinations as entry signals, on all the time frames. There are many of them with very good profits. But margin call is the constant of the model . It’s like death it self. You can be sure it will catch you, soon or later. With this background it’s hard to me to believe that anybody could make consistent profits with all this stuff. I must say this because I stopped posting on the forum. And this could make think the readers that I have found the holly grail and have left the market as a millionaire. I have read other forums where the starter of the idea, or any other person who has made a contribution disappeared without telling the others how did they ended. And it’s very used also that many of the readers think that they reach their first million and quit the market. Another important fact is, as you know, retail brokers are most of them scammers. With more or less care of the manners they are trading against you all the time, trying to cheating you with all the tools they found (legally or not). Remember they are not regulated, and SEC and NFA have showed how they work. Finally, market conditions change all the time regarding the juncture. These must make changes on your trading parameters. But the notices could arrive with the margin call. I’m in the fully convincement that FUNDAMENTAL analysis moves the market. And TECHNICAL analysis is an excellent tool to confirm the fundamental movement. I have found that there are many other financial instruments more reliable, and you can use them with a kind of martingale, without an EA. For example: CFD or ETF. They are high regulated, offer low leverage, and you can trade long and/or short. The best part is that you don’t need to be glued to your charts. Disadvantage is the higher balance necessary to follow this trading style and keep commissions reasonable. This is my own opinion from a retail trader, in forex market since October 2006. Of course there were some traders who have made profits from this. And still doing them. I couldn’t, and I feel I must tell everybody my experience, because I made public my support to martingale's. For me it’s enough of Forex. Just my two cents. Good trades. Rama

Hi Rama, You’ve moved me to make my first post on this forum. I want to thank you for all your work on martingale EAs. As a newcomer to this forum but not to trading, I have spent the past two weeks reading, taking notes and comparing the EAs from the best threads on martingale and semi-martingale methods, and I had come to the conclusion that your EA was by far the most sophisticated of the lot. You also seemed to rise above the invidious flame wars and politics that have plagued the martingale discussion, quietly carrying out your programming efforts with unusual skill, diligence and generosity. I wanted to thank you for all of that but I didn’t know where you were after you disappeared from this forum in June of last year. When I woke up this morning thinking about your EA and returned to this thread I found your latest post. So let me take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for your outstanding contributions. Unfortunately, now I also have to thank you for the warning in your last post! It is indeed rare that a programmer shows as much care for the welfare of those whose lives he has influenced as you have in your last post, but this is consistent with the integrity you’ve expressed throughout this thread. So thanks again, amigo. (And yes I did think you might have gone off to enjoy the millions made by using your EA!) I’m sorry to hear that you no longer consider martingale EAs to be a path toward millions. However, as much as I appreciate the warning , I don’t think I’m quite ready to give up on my search for a safe way to use martingale methods, particularly in dealing with whiplash in the early going of correct entries (the scourge of my own modest programming efforts). I had already concluded that a “sniper” approach using short-sequence semi-martingale methods was the only prudent way, and your post reinforces my thinking that the proper conditions might be found in the context of news events and awareness of fundamentals. I wonder if you would care to elaborate on this? If not, that’s ok, I could understand your reluctance to re-involve yourself in this oh-so-fascinating subject after making a final effort to clear the slate! lol. Mucho gracias, traderjohn

You'd best listen to Rama... We have a lot of casualties here, incuding myself. The global credit crunch increased FX volailities by approximately 300%. This is no exaggeration. It is an UNDERESTIMATE. Linear regression will confirm this if you still disbelieve me. This system worked in the past. I've made $$ on it, but I've lost more than I've made on aggregate. U'd best take our advice and find another way to play the markets.

HI Rama, I think I know how to keep this EA from blowing up. I was wondering if you could make a small change to your EA that would prevent it from blowing up your account again like it did because of FOMC news. With this manor change I think it could be a very good money maker and you will never have to worry of an account blowup again. Just change it so it only places orders after the first one when ema crosses AND pip steps are met. Please see the attach picture for a clearer explanation. thanks Mike

My dear friend, I would like to point out to you that there is one major flaw with this trading style, and that is risk... Forget all the fancy charts and indicators, and consider this scenario: The market moves 10 handles, or 1000 pips unidirectionally. Happens pretty often on quite a few pairs these days. What settings are you going to use to prevent the margin call? The strategy goes like this: 1) 0.01 2) 0.02 3) 0.04 4) 0.08 5) 0.16 6) 0.32 7) 0.64 8) 1.28 9) 2.56 By the time you've hit the 9th order, you've purchased a grand total of 5.11 lots! That's US$5110 for you on USD base pairs such as Cable and EURUSD! Your margin's depleted and you receive a margin call. You're banking on a reversal/retrace which isn't about to happen in the next few days/or weeks/or never. The martingale works when prices revert. When they move unidirectionally, the martingale fails miserably. If you don't believe me, go ahead and try it out. Use Swiss Army Knife order management system to help you out. Or if you can't be bothered, just run your account without stop losses. On any pipstep setting. I guarantee you'll regret it. I watched as Xaron's and rama's accounts blew up. I used order management, and stayed in the game for a while longer, watching my stop losses get hit time after time, and my account balance depleting. You will never know how it feels to lose so hard until you try it for yourself. So go ahead. Learn your painful lesson. From your post, I know you won't be convinced by well-intentioned words. The only thing capable of disciplining a trader is the market itself. Good Luck and Happy Learning.

You must enable expert advisors. See bottom signaled in yellow.

Sounds very interesting. Which are the settings of the ema? PD: I'm working on a new version that improves the order's manage basic logic, delete parameters not used, and reorder code for easier understanding by anybody. So changes can be made easier. Rama

Well, if you want to add some longevity to this system, what I can tell you is this: 1) Use factorlot 1.5 2) Maxtrades should not exceed 6 3) Code the EA such that it places a maximum of 3 orders per hour. So that you won't buy all the way up a spike or sell all the way down. Martingales can work. It's just that I find automated martingales don't. Martingales work on the basis that each time you make a trade, there is a 50% chance of the market moving in your favour. This assumption is violated by fixing pipsteps when you trade against a trend: Conditional probabilities are no longer 50%. A new order should only be placed where there is a period of consolidation (where market direction truly is a random walk). Using an EMA crossing isn't going to solve all your problems. The EMA becomes flat after a period of consolidation just before a trend breakout, and I can see it solving some problems, but not all. IMO, it'll still blow up in the end w/o monitoring.
