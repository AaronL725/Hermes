Hi everybody ! That 's the new simple system i'm testing since september. It looks very promising : trading EUR/USD and GBP/USD and EUR/JPY, you will see this system has been able to bring almost 2400 pips since september. All is based on price action but we need only 2 indicators : 50 EMA, we are going to dance with her in the trend. 5 SMA is just here to avoid range periods. TF 4H Let's have a look to the chart :

--- 帖子 #2 ---
You can see on this chart we enter short the 1st november at the open of this candle at 1.3814. Why ? Because the candle before closed more than 100 pips from the EMA 50 .

--- 帖子 #3 ---
So we sell EUR/USD at 1.3814. The stop loss is 100 pip ( 1.3914). Now, we are waiting, if our stop is not touched, we are going for the next step.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi zebulon, welcome with your new thread... It seems very nice. About the rules: Do we need a cross of the faster ema too? And what about SL &amp; TP? Thanks! EDIT: You've already answer about SL........

--- 帖子 #5 ---
The next step is selling again when the price is touching the 50 EMA, but we need at least 80 pips between this level and the previous sell order. So we sell again at 1.3726 the 11 november. Our stop loss is 100 pips (1.3826) The stop loss for the first order is also moved to 1.3826

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks Aztrader, now, we don't care about 5 SMA, we will see later why we need it... Now we are waiting for our stop loss to be touched, or for the next step : The 18 november, we sell again at 1.3594 and all our SL are moved to 1.3694.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
the 29 november, we sell again at 1.3407, all our SL are moved to 1.3507. The SL is trigerred one day later and we win a total of 513 pips.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Because the last candle closed more than 100 pips above the 50 EMA, we buy at the open of the next candle at 1.3516 with a SL at 1.3416. Unfortunately, the SL is touched. Since 1st december, we had no signal to buy or to sell, because no candle closed more than 100 pips from 50 EMA. We are in a range, and only the trend is good for us. If the 5 SMA is going up and down crossing several times the 50 EMA, that a good signal to go to the beach or for some shopping... We can avoid range period

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Bad luck....... But in my charts, price never closed 100 pips above 50 EMA ( I put 2 levels in the property of 50 Ema: +100 &amp; -100, so it's visually easy to see the distance of the close)

--- 帖子 #10 ---
So you had no signal, and you didn't loose 100 pips... Brokers are different and 4H candles don't start at the same hour...

--- 帖子 #11 ---
We will see together how the system is working. At the moment, EUR/USD, GBP/USD and EUR/JPY are ranging. EMA 50 is flat and the price is not far from EMA. Time frame 4H allows us to do something else and not staying all day in front of the screen. Actually it is dangerous to go in the market, price will go north or south ??? we don't know. Let price action tell us the truth when it will be the moment.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Zebulon, your system seems very simple and interesting. Thanks for sharing! Going to have a try!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Zebulon Indeed I like simple trading method like yours with minimum use of indicator may be just 1 or most 2. I use PA incorporate with MA and/or BB. I will often drop this thread.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Zubulon thx for posting your system i have set up my charts 3 prs and will trade along,keep us informed of possible entrys so we can follow along. From my understanding the stoploss is 100 pips and the 2nd 3rd entries have to be at least 80 pips lower from previous entry,always keeping your stop 100 pips behind the price. Is this correct... Regards

--- 帖子 #15 ---
The stoploss for all the orders is 100 pips from the last order. It is not a trailing stop. That means we will loose 100 pips for the last order. That's the price to pay to go further.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
another example with GBP/USD: 10 october, we bought at 1.5618 as the previous candle closed morethan 100 pips from EMA 50. We bought again at 1.5711 and 1.5976 We were stopped at 1.5876 with a global win of 323 pips.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Pls. keep posting.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
No opportunities to trade now. Prices are ranging . Waiting for a strong trend ...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Don't worry. Let is come to you. (I am practicing to be patience)

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Yes ! Patience is the key ! the trend will come later.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks for sharing man..good points presented here. I will follow it closely..

--- 帖子 #22 ---
First post here so please bear with me. Having had a quick look at this system I found that quite often the price didn't make it back to the 50 EMA line but it did track the EMA + or - 100. I looked at taking as the trigger for the next move a crossing of the +/- line instead of the actual EMA. So I would propose entering as per post one and then wait for the price to move 80 pips. When that has happened wait for the next candle to open above/below the appropriate 100 line and move the stop down to 100 pips from this new level. This looks as though it will clean up some of the pips left on the table by the original method. I have a micro account with FXCM and will try this out in the New Year. Will keep a close eye out for any further developments. Ross

two sell signals today : EUR/USD at 1.3264 EUR/JPY at 102.82 let the trend run !!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
another sell signal today : GBP/USD at 1.5480

--- 帖子 #25 ---
yesterday, sell EUR/USD at 1.3264

--- 帖子 #26 ---
yesterday, sell EUR/JPY at 102.82

--- 帖子 #27 ---
today, sell GBP/USD at 1.5480

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi, I hope you'll go on showing us how you manage those trades. TIA Regards BBF

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I thought zebulon already showed several charts that illustrating how he managed the trades. (pls. keep posting) Just curious why you asked so?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
You don't mind if I ask What is your the average monthly profit pips since sept? p. s. I really do like this trading method Cheers

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Zebulan If I miss an entry as shown in green arrow in the image, do I chase for reentry like those shown in blue "?" ? p. s. The candle in the box has &gt;100 pips from 50 EMA. Cheers

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Since sept : EUR/USD 1374 pips + actual trade open at 1,3264 GBP/USD 74 pips + actual trade open at 1.5480 EUR/JPY 949 pips + actual trade open at 102.82

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Nice system, only trading trends and staying in that trend until it changes direction. What more could you want?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I prefer an entry at the first candle (green arrow). If i miss the open of the candle, i have 4 hours to reentry enventually. If i miss the entire candle i prefer to wait for the next signal.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I think the 1st entry of 100 pips is the core of making good pips in this trading method. Of course no trading method is 100% loss-free OK... wait for the next signal sounds a better option! Rule no. 1... preserve the capital Rule no. 2... read rule no. 2

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thanks. Cheers

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I am watching EUR-AUD closely... looking for up? otherwise retrace down? What do you think zebulon? Cheers

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I didn't test this pair. But, according to the rules, i can see i would have sell 28 november at 1.35, and sell again 9 december at 1.32. it is possible to sell again today (if we didn't sell at 1.32 because price is less than 80 pips) So, yes i think it will go south. But i don't know if parameters (100 pips from EMA50 for the first entry, 100 pips stop loss) are good for this pair. Maybe, they must be adapted for the pair. But the actual price (1.31) is not far from EUR/USD, so parameters could be good...

--- 帖子 #39 ---
zebulon, Possible sale near at EUR/USD and GBP/USD right?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
sorry, but i can't see any signal now !

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hello, I have upload a screenshot, it does not meet the rules? thank you

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Not for me, your time frame is H1, mine is H4

--- 帖子 #43 ---
sorry zebulon, I have now corrected the timeframe

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi Zebulon, thanks for your Idea on this Thread. I like the concept of dancing with the Emas and having not much time to follow the charts the H4 is surely an interesting alternative. I would just like to understand better your post above (actually the way to enter the trades): You mentioned to add an enter at the bounce of the EMA50, which I understand, and you normally open the trades after the close of an H4 bar (which I would prefer for not being forced to follow the price during that candle), but in the last "Buy" order was placed during the H4 candle while it actually closed way below the EMA50. So it was clearly for sure not a bounce. Why did you not wait for the close (and perhaps therefore avoid the losing trade) ? It is absolutely not a kind of any criticism, just really wish to better understand if I perhaps did not understand well the concept. I would like to forward test it too (and visually backtesting a bit during the weekend). Many thanks

--- 帖子 #45 ---
O! I forgot the 100-pips "strength" for this pair! Let's ignore it. p.s. Congratulation! Your thread is rated "5 STARS!" Cheers

--- 帖子 #46 ---
zebulon Watching the candle heading back to south... Any comment? Cheers

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I think we don't look at the same candles. It depends of your broker. Maybe my 4 hour candle is from 11 to 3, and yours is from 12 to 4...

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thank you but i prefer this thread is rated by the market

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I only watch the candles moving now. ..

--- 帖子 #50 ---
The market will tell us if we will loose 100 pips at 1.5580 or if the trend allows us to win plenty of pips !!!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Sorry, my fault. I should have better attached your chart to my previous post to better explain my question: In your below attached chart I do not clearly understand why you bought the 3rd time (Yellow highlighted bar). I think it was because of the bounce of the EMA50. Is that correct ? Did you buy at the EMA50 ? Shouldn't you (or I in future) wait for that candle to close and see if that Touch was a bounce of the EMA or a break through (like in this case) ? Thank you

--- 帖子 #52 ---
yes, i bought when the price hit the EMA 50. I don't wait for the candle to close. you don't know if this yellow highlighted bar is really a break through. it depends of the future !

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Many thanks, I understand now. I thought we wait for the candle to close for considering a new entry, but I quite understand that if you have the possibility to follow you surely want to optimize your trades. Thank you for the reply and for the system.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hello Zebulon, Before my question - thank you for sharing this interesting system. I see that the H4 signal candle must close 100 pips or more from the 50 EMA. However, I believe this candle must also touch the 50 EMA. Is this right? Thanks - Cheoy Lee

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Zebulon, I guess you are already short in GU as per first white arrow in the chart attached. Ema 50 is in this moment at about 80 pips above your short entry, so no SL yet. Price is approaching to Touch the Ema 50. Will you add now a short trade (second white arrow) as soon as the price will touch the Ema 50 ? If yes, your new SL will be at 100 pips above the new entry ? The previous SL will remain at 100 pips above the first entry ? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Zebulon, This is a really cool system... How did you come up with the 50EMA &amp; 5SMA? Thanks, Rob

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I was wondering this too. And do you trade lower then 4H frames? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Question. What do we do at the weekend. Just let it all roll over? Ross

--- 帖子 #59 ---
For the first entry, the candle must close 100 pips or more from the 50EMA, it is not necessary this candle touch the 50 EMA

--- 帖子 #60 ---
No i will not add a short trade if the price is above the first entry. Because the potential loss could be more than 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
It's a long story, lots of backtests. I thouht about different systems which allows to stay in a trend and avoid ranges. hope itis the good one

--- 帖子 #62 ---
No, not with this system. I test another one with TF 15min. But 4H frame is comfortable because you don't have to stay all day long in front of your screen. You have plenty of time (like now) to manage your trades. So it is a stressless system...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Absolutely !! going to the beach, having some fun, living !!! The risk = stop lost = 100 pips It is possible when the price is far from the entry to move the sop loss to break eaven : EUR/USD we sell at 1.3264, the price is actually 1.3036, it is more than 200 pips from our entry. In this case, yes, i would move my stop for a free run

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thanks a lot for your explanation. May I ask if you are actually still in this trade G/U ? I noticed that the SL of 100 pips has not been achieved yet. Thanks for your time and patience

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Yes i am ! Short at 1.5480, SL 1.5580

--- 帖子 #66 ---
at 1.5480 the price is not touching the 50 EMA as per your rules, so why did you open at this price?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
For the first entry, the rule is : when a 4H bar close more than 100 pips from the EMA 50, open a trade at the open of the next 4H bar. For the 2d, 3rd, 4th.. entry, it is when the price is touching the 50 EMA.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
To the rules of the 2d, 3rd, 4th...entry: it is when the price is touching the 50 Ema on a retrace , but only if the price at the touch is at least 80 pips in positive from your entry. Is the underlined correct ? Thank you

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Our SL has been touched for GBP/USD...

--- 帖子 #71 ---
...and actually (if I am not wrong) it has given a new long signal...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Yes, you're right, GBP/USD buy at 1.5683

--- 帖子 #73 ---
EUR/USD sell signal at 1.3120

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Could you say what's your winning/losing ratio up til now? Also, will try to code this in Java, when have the time. Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I know that this is not very good for the Trading Psichology, but I honestly closed both trades already. With profit, but discretionally, not "mechanically". The point is that as soon as I saw (and entered) a long on GU and a short on EU I thoght that it could not be a great move on the long term as they usually do not diverge that much IMHO. Moreover this period of the year is for my thoughts not the very best to be traded. Are you still in ? Having a look backwards at the charts I saw that in most of the "Losing" Trades the price went at least some 20, 30 pips in profit as well, before turning the other way. Did you notice it ? Any Idea about that ?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Thank you for coding ! it could help !! the results : EUR/USD: 15/09 sell 1.3856 +344 pips 21/09 sell 1.3756 + 244 pips 27/09 sell 1.3604 + 92 pips 6/10 sell 1.3412 -100 pips 10/10 buy 1.3567 + 282 pips 18/10 buy 1.3680 + 169 pips 26/10 buy 1.3819 + 30 pips 31/10 buy 1.3949 - 100 pips 1/11 sell 1.3814 +307 pips 11/11 sell 1.3726 + 219 pips 18/11 sell 1.3594 + 87 Pips 29/11 sell 1.3407 -100 pips 30/11 buy 1.3516 - 100 pips 12/12 sell 1.3264 20/12 sell 1.3120 GBP/USD : 27/09 sell 1.5608 -100 pips 3/10 sell 1.5500 -100 pips 10/10 buy 1.5618 +258 pips 20/10 buy 1.5711 + 165 pips 1/11 buy 1.5976 - 100 pips 15/11 sell 1.5860 + 151 pips 29/11 sell 1.5609 -100 pips 30/11 buy 1.5749 -100 pips 13/12 sell 1.5480 -100 pips 20/12 buy 1.5683 EUR/JPY : 6/09 sell 109.85 +597 pips 15/09 sell 106.70 + 282 pips 27/09 sell 104.14 +26 pips 6/10 sell 102.88 -100 pips 10/10 buy 104.39 + 160 pips 18/10 buy 105.20 + 79 pips 1/11 buy 106.99 -100 pips 9/11 sell 105.79 +105 pips 28/11 sell 103.74 -100 pips 12/12 sell 102.82

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Yes i'm still in ! Because the aim is to stay in the trend as long as possible. Maybe EUR/USD will go south 1000 pips more !! Who knows ?? If GU will go north, we are already in position to make pips. We pay 100 pips to see where the price will go.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi there, This strategy is very sound and in about a month, after I have completed my live test, I would like to offer a modification (enhancement) to this very simple system. From the results of the euro, which is the only one I am interested in trading, it is clear that a sound money management system can be attached if the trader has sufficient working capital. That too, I would like to offer at the end of January. In the meantime, however, we have a minor discrepancy. The euro got knocked out at (sell1.3120) 1.3220 at 05.22 EST on December 21. I thought I was going to be knocked out as I was set at 1.3133 (don't know why EMA50 was different!) and the max. price 1.3224. So I am still alive (whew) Again, congratulations on a simple ,successful system and I hope we can have a lot of fun (and profits) with it. Seasons greetings.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks !! For me, the highest price on december 21 is 1.3197. Brokers are different, prices are different...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
My God !

--- 帖子 #81 ---
That is one hell of a "difference", especially as everything else has lined up to the "t".!! I am using a futures broker trading 6E.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
zebulon, on all the trades after the first one...if the price keeps touching the 50 ema do you only place one trade? Or can you place a trade for each touch that is 80 pips away from the original if you didn't catch the first one? Because on the eur/usd price recently has touched the 50 ema about 9 times. So i imagine you place only one until the next one but if you missed on the touch you could get in on the next touch if it happens right away and you still follow the rules.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
As you can see, for me the price didn't reach 1.3200 after the sell at 1.3120

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Yes, only one trade per level and each level is at least 80 pips away from another level. If you didn't catch the first one, you can place a trade at another touch or at a better price if it is possible...

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Amazing there can be over a 30 pip difference between quote systems or brokers. So all your work is off a quote system or are you trading sim/real time? I am going to check with a couple of these spread houses and see what they come up with for that day, after Christmas. Edit: I figured out what happened. It seems that the quote system is set to indicate the closing price every four minutes, hence the close at 1.3197, BUT the price spike did actually go through to 1.3224. So if there was an order pending over 1.3197 and up to 1.3224 (stop) it would been filled. Therefore, you have been stopped out at 1.3220, unfortunately.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
No, i can tell you the chart above shows exactly the price and even an pending order at 1.3200 would not have been filled. I'm working with real time charts.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Interesting,I use almost the same way to trade before.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Ok, I just caught up with my French translation of "prix moyens", which means average price. Therefore, I have to assume the close of the bar in question was the AVERAGE of that period, being 1.3197, but in reality, the price WENT through TO 1.3224 . The truth of the matter, is I was also long ES mini and waited in abated breathe that I was going to get stopped at 1.3233 in my 6E trade in the fast market conditions at the time.I lucked out. But,that knocked out your "stop" at 1.3220. Maybe, it could be worth your while to set up a demo account to help with entry and exit points.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
hey zebulon I read about your method and it looks good. to take out some profits we need a second trade that must be at least 100 pip from first entry to get minimum 1 pip right?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
hey folks, just watched in the history and count how many trades we had since first week of october till now GBP/JPY: 9 trades EUE/JPY: 9 trades EUR/USD: 11 trades AUD/USD: 10 trades all this trades are following the rules. so with a risk of 2% per trade can be interesting results at the end of month

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Yes !!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Nice &amp; simple strategy...sometimes the most effective systems are those that are easy to understand and implement and this system appears to be such. As Zebulon pointed out, the key is PA. Once you understand how the Forex market moves, then it's a matter of using a system which you can understand easily and apply consistently. I've created a PDF which highlights the main points of Zebulon's system and hopefully all of you will find it helpful. Let me know if I've left anything out. Great Job Zebulon! Enjoy.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
thanks ragu !!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
maybe y van explain about your moneymanagment?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
This looks incredibly promising. Have been experimenting a bit. Actually impressed. But needs something added maybe, but cannot figure out what..

--- 帖子 #96 ---
the only y can add is to take out profits. cant be y see 500 pip with first position and only take the half. maybe take 1/2 or 1/3 out afte we see 500pip?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hello Zebulon, thanks for sharing your strategy. I like it because it is simple and it is a trend following one . I did some work and coded it for MetaTrader to do backtests for a longer time period. That is the result from January 2008 to December 2011 WITHOUT taking care about if we are in a trending market or not. If a candle closes 100 pips or more away from the EMA 50 (H4) a trade is entered and the following trades are entered when the EMA 50 is touched and we are at least 80 pips away from the previous trade´s entry. The SL is also set as described to 100 pips away from the last trade´s entry for all trades. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1324936463 There are periods where we gain big profit but most is given away again because we entered the market and no trend began. Now i included the EMA 5 into the EA to take care about whether there is a trend or not . As a rule I defined that the initial market entry (and so the following ones, too) may only be done if the EMA 5 did not cross the EMA 50 for at least 25 candles. That is the result from January 2008 to December 2011: http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1324936463 What do I want to show with it? If you have a good trend following strategy you need to stay out of the market if there is no trend (of course). And the question is always to make out, if the market is trending or not. I think that it is a nice result if a simple rule like not to trade if the faster MA did hit the slower MA for a predefined period. And if even that one simple step makes such a difference, I would like to ask you what kind of other method could be used in addition to reach an even better result? Greetings, APeng. P.S. That´s my first post in this forum and I had trouble with embedding the images - I hope it worked and you don´t mind that they are attached, too.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
this is how I like to do. this ea put sl:100pip. tp:1000pip and takes out 50% when we see 500pip when I enter trade automatically

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Very nice aPeng ... Can you program other stop losses as a get in signal that work better? To me it would seem that 140 pip range on a stop loss that a lot of trades stops would not be hit but I can't tell if that helps with profitability. I don't think changeing the managment of the trade or the type of get in is a good idea. Thoughts? Also, what was the initial starting equity on your run. % return over or profit factor?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Your welcome. Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thank you for the good job !! Is it possible to have results for one pair ? To compare EUR/USD with EUR/JPY and GBP/USD. I think EUR/USD offers the best... To avoid ranging periods, i was thinking about this rule : when 5 SMA cross 3 times 50 EMA, we don't trade before 15 new candles appears. But your idea with 25 candles is very interesting, only backtesting can help us to show the good way.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I post the other data of the backtests later. There you can see initial starting capital and so on. I try some tests with a bigger SL.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
The testet pair is EUR/USD. I try EUR/GBP later and post the results (other pairs may follow when necessary but I need to download the tickdatat before) I try out the "when 5 SMA cross 3 times 50 EMA, we don't trade before 15 new candles appears." -way. I am curious for the results.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Apeng, in post 390 Zebulon has posted some results from forward testing, it would be good to see if your EA can reproduce those results

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Here are the backtests posted above in more detail.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Attached is a chart with a 300 pips SL trade. If we widen the SL we skip some failtrades. But if we are in a trend the last trades of the "trading-row" are pulled into loss because of the bigger SL. I don´t think that a bigger SL is key. More a good sense, if the market could start to trend or not.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Would you please stop ranting about Zebulon's stop at 3220 being hit?!. The spike that day on my platform capped at 1.31965 and I trade with GFT. There might be heightened volatility due to thin volume and small brokers like urs might just use spread widening arbitrarily. I repeat, his stop was not hit. I really had to post on this thread because u kept at it. Learn more about spread widening, OTCs, DDs, STPs and so on.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
+2,297 pips in total in few months. That would be $22,970 trading one standard lot on a standard account. Nice

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hey mate. I observed Zebulon's strategy might be a potentially profitable one in the long run, but you have to understand it carries an arbitral risk/reward ratio. I can only advice you to demo test it on a good number of trades to get good results. If you risk 100pips to make 20pips, it only takes a single loss to wipe 5 profits. Either back+front test it to get ur good mm that fits or just let your trades run the way Zebulon prescribed. You never can tell what trade will make the big break. Period is not an excuse, who knows what the opening price of the fiber would be come 2012?...all the best to you!

is it done? Would be interesting to backtest it. Can you also code it for metatrader?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I have looked at the charts, but can not see the stop loss and the take profit points. Pls explain further to me, what to do when EMA 5 approaches 50. as I do not understand how to give a gap of 100pips before taking another trade. Thanks Oyeshiku

--- 帖子 #112 ---
May i ask where you do your testing? Just curious. Metatrader is a piec of c rap with testing multiple time frames. Also, thanks for running the 25 bars where 5 above 50 ema is above before the cross. That helps.....I am running 15 mn timframe ea with bars 20-25 as a test.. if stopout I go 3-4 hours before a new trade ... I think the idea your stating is to have a long trend before the cross...It would seem like a lot of decent trades could be wiped out if you do a complete 25..thoughts ? Also, it would appear that you do not take advantage of addon trades in the testing. Don't know for sure. ..Anyone with ideas on filtering crosses...I am all ears! There are no easy answers.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I use Metatrader (I posted the whole backtests results for the previous tests above, so it should be obvious). I have no problems backtesting multiple timeframes with MT. But the strategy uses only one anyway. I implemented the addon trades - I simulated exactly zebulon strategy. Another thougt is to close a part of the position. Trades are often in profit area before running into SL. So if the trade is +100 pips close half of the lots and you are break even without pulling the SL to +/- zero pips. Doing that you dont have a closer SL and you are not beeing stopped out too fast and if a trend starts you are still in the market. What kind of programm would you commend instead of Metatrader?

I don't know of any other programs to test... so I was surpised you were able to test this out using metatrader with add on trades. I was hoping to get something that actually can test a real system out , but I am pretty much a trial and error person.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
SL hit on GBP/USD. I propose to wait for the trend with this pair because it is ranging. You can see 5SMA recently cross 3 times 50 EMA and 10 times since november 30. Let the profit run on EUR/USD and EUR/JPY

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Apeng, could you do a backtest starting Sept 2011 to end of November 2011. It would be interesting to see how your results compare with Zebulon's forward test

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Nice job APeng. Keep up the good work. I backtest on metatrader too and also work with the DealBoook from GFT. But recently, GFT has removed the strategy tester from DB and I'm stuck with MT4 and Excel. Closing part of the position is a good idea but you have to know it changes the risk/reward of the strategy. Risking 100pips on 0.1 lot on a standard account gives u a $100 loss if your SL hits. To be able to close half positions, you'll need to use 0.2 lots which hands you a $200 loss if the SL hits first. This is just a case study...I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi, I have read through this thread several times over the past week and am quite impressed with this system. It appears to be a very simple and yet profitable one. Although I do not trade useing time based charts I am trying it out useing 6pip range charts on 6 diffrent pairs on a demo account. So far I am down $39.42 but still have a trade on the go that is up $23.00. i am trying to get this to work on a shorter time so as not to have to leve trades runing for long periods of time, I rather be able to get in and get out over one day.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
My historical data only reaches to september the 21. I have to download first new data what I am going to do in january to have the full years data of 2011. In post # 105 you can see the backtests I´ve done in detail. Maybe you could take a chart with the EMAs and compare some of the trades the EA has done to verify them. I would like to know the result.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I like the system, and it works well. thanks

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I agree. I like this system too. I took 3 - 4 hr trades this week and this system is the only one producing a winning trade. The winning trade is on the EJ. I'm not sure of all of the backtesting stuff but it looks like a pretty good system so far.

@zebulon you took cable long?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
@felix, as i said abobe, cable is ranging. 5 SMA had crossed 50 EMA many times and i will do nothing untill we have 15 candles after a cross without a new cross...

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Zeb, When you say 15 candles, is that 15 - 4 hr candles?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Can you please tell me if I need to look open and close for 100 pips for the candle or High and Low? Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #127 ---
yes, it is 4h candles

--- 帖子 #128 ---
for the first entry, you have to look if the close is 100 pips away from the 50 EMA

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Thanks Sir.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Actually, 3 trades are running on EUR/USD with potentially +614 pips 1 trade on EUR/JPY with +354 pips

--- 帖子 #131 ---
And more ....

--- 帖子 #132 ---
If a first candle close 60 and the next one close 50, will it be considered as 100 close below line? can we combine the close of two or 3 candles to get 100 and go for trade? Thanks Sir

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Yes, we combine several candles. When a candle is closed, if you are 100 pips away from 50 EMA, it is the first entry.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi Zebulon, Nice and easy system to follow.I want to know how do you use 5 SMA for this method. Thanks

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi, I understand how your system works but I dont understand that once you have entered 100 pips below the 50 ma and then you place your second trade 80 pips after the first one if a candle touches the line do you close the first position to take profit. If so you will only have 80 pips profit if no your second trade may get stopped out and you will lose 20pips . is that correct if not can you explain where I am going Wrong. Cheers

--- 帖子 #136 ---
please, read post n° 101, 115, 124

--- 帖子 #137 ---
No i don't close the first trade. I open a new trade each time the price touch 50 EMA if price is at least 80 pips from the previous trade.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thankyou Zebulon

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Zebulon, if that is the case on your second trade that you open and the price goes against you you can lose the 100 plus 80 from the firsrt trade , am I understanding it correct. when do you take profit ?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
All the stop loss are moved to the last level, please read post n° 5, 6, 7

--- 帖子 #141 ---
i am useing the the system and it works well. I mosty use the 15 min chart to trade cause i do not have the heart the go up 200 pip can come back and see it down to 75 pips. ( i am getting better). So now u use the Dancing with EMA system as my long term trades and i still my 15 min chart trade system for my quick trades. I can post my system if u r interested, as soon as i learn how to attach the charts if u like. again thank for the system and it works well. I will post a copy of my account to show u how i am doing with my 15 min chart trading system. My the Pips be with u

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I would be interested if you could tell me how far from ema and also what filter criteria is used. ...I find the 15 difficult because you run into short term s/r and seems to be more of 50-50 proposition. If s its just an eyeball than its hard to come by

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi Zebulon, Just dropped by to appraise your efforts. I can see your system is bringing in more pips. Keep up the good work man.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi Zebulon, Thanks for sharing a good simple strategy. I'm new to the forex trading.... Now I'm demo trading. After finding this strategy few days back, I'm trying implement this in my demo trading.... At the moment of submitting this post, I don't find any valid entry signal following your strategy .... Is there any valid entry signal now for your proposed currency pair for this strategy.... Just want to make sure, whether I'm understanding it properly or not....

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thanks ! patience is the key ! there is no valid entry signal now. But watch at GBP/USD, maybe the range will be finished soon. Let see if the candle will close under1.54

--- 帖子 #146 ---
It's time to come back with GBP/USD. Sell at 1.5379 SL 100 pips

--- 帖子 #147 ---
thanks for the great system, been trying out for the past week i am currently holding short eurusd since 5th jan, now up 200 pips long usdchf +50 pips long audusd -50 pips should i move my eurusd to BE first?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Yes, if you are 200 pips up on EUR/USD, you can move to BE !

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi all, what’s the filter on this again, not really explained ? Using the 5sma for ranging periods, its indecisiveness up/down happens all the time. I use it in another system for 4 years now and know it can’t be used in this way for a 4hr method (or as I see). So anyway along with someone else here, I coded it for MT4, it seems to be having a good run on some of the pairs lately, but doesn’t stand the last 10 years. The last 3 years and you’d be creamed. At best you could average out. Don’t mean to sound negative, methods need to prove to me they can stand the test of time in all conditions. This reminds me of another method about 5-6 yrs back, they all got creamed too. I see potential so I’m going to run some other filters and see what arises.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Zebulon, I've followed you in GBP/USD.... One thing I want to clear.... in your example, every time, the first entry was after cross over of 5 sma, about 100 points down/up of 50 EMA.... here for GBP/USD... first 100 point bearish candle ignored.... I don't know, whether I've explained you correctly as I wanted.... Is there anything I'm missing.... Sorry for my weak english and dumb question (if it is....) thanks mazis12

--- 帖子 #151 ---
To avoid ranging periods, here is the rule : when 5 SMA cross 3 times 50 EMA, we don't trade before 15 new candles appears. Your backtest included this rule will be different

--- 帖子 #152 ---
GBP/USD was ranging, so we didn't touched it untill today, because 15 candles appears since the last cross of the 5 SMA and 50 EMA.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
hi zebullon.. nice system you have here.. regarding the 15 candles.. can you please put some screenshot.. i don't understand.. thanks

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Zeb... are you also saying that if you miss the cross or it doesnt qualify...you can take the 80 pip from the cross of the 5. ----if the 5 is under the ema for 15 bars since the last cross.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
After 3 cross, we don't entry before 15 new candles without crossing again.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
No, i said if you miss an order, it is possible sometimes to catch it later, or even at a better price.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
thanks Zebulon, have you got a visual example of a non-trade because of this rule ? just so I can be 100% sure. Sorry scrap that, just seen your earlier post !

--- 帖子 #158 ---

zebulon Did you mean your 3 entries were taken based on candle closed, even thou they are bullish candlesticks? cheers

Not the candle closed, but when price touch EMA 50.

Made this week 500 pips

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Need a clear understanding of the 3 crossover, 15 bar filter ! Then I can code it ...

--- 帖子 #165 ---
pips qty means nothing, 'worth' means everthing. I can pull in 500 pips that'll make £500, I could also pull in 15 pips and still make £500. Risk/Reward. Has the 500 pips made you 10% up with 2% risk ? or 2% up on 5% risk ? This could be a good thread, lets see. Been dicing with adx for false entries as I cant understand the triple cross and 15 bar count, probably simple, what have you been using ?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Trying to explain as best as i can....Sorry for my poor english !! To avoid periods of range, if SMA 5 cross EMA 50 3 times, you count the next candles : as you can see on the chart, the black line (SMA 5) cross the blue line (EMA 50) 3 times. After that we have 4 candles before another cross. 4&lt; 15 candles. go on. After that, we have 8 candles before another cross. 8&lt; 15. go on. After that, we have 9 candles before another cross. 9&lt; 15. go on. After that, we have more than 15 candles without a new cross,so we are waiting for a candle closing more than 100 pips from EMA 50 for an entry. I hope this could help !!

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Ah, I’m with you now. No, your English is good it’s me seeing things ! Very good !

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Zebulon, if the first candle storms through the 100 pip barrier, say over by 200 pips ... do you still take it ?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Wow dude! Hi zebulon! It's impossible! When I tested your system, I could not believe my eyes. It's very simple, very profitable, very unstressed. Good job. You are greatest master!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Yes !! i follow the rules !!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi zebulon! I translated your rules to Russian. If you don't mind.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
no problem ! i have russian friends here in France...

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hello dear traders, I have become interested in your great effort and job zelubon, so decided to join the thread. For an easier monitoring of the charts I've written an indicator which allows to follow up the 50EMA channel at the interval of [-100;100] pips. I am willing it could be helpful.

Hmm... Looks like good.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Can you post your template?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Нi zebulon! Look at my picture please! May be I doing something without rules?

It seems good, except when a trade is 200 pips in profit, you can move SL to BE...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi Zebulon, As a newbie, I can easily say, It's the best strategy I've ever come across in my little forex experience. The problem I face is the I miss the entry points as I can't sit back continuously..... how can I solve it?? most of the times, I see the entry point when price already rides 20-30 pips after hitting the entry.... Should I entry whenever i can see accepting the 20-30 pips loss..... entry criteria doesn't allow this..... confused....

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi Danutz! According to rules of the author, should be at least 80 pips between last entry and previous sell order.My broker GMT+2. Point of touching 50EMA is 1.2771. Previous sell order 1.2823. 1.2823 - 1.2771=52 pips.What time of your broker?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hy Fxforever My broker time is GMT, I wait to close first candle which touch the EMA and i enter after that. I know the rules of the author, but please check my attached template. Best Regards Danutz

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Brrr... It is very difficult! But everyone makes his own choices:nerd:

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I definitely agree with ruten. Template is a way more difficult than could be expected regarding to the rules of the strategy. Also I guess Danutz is not the only one who is trying to chase the trend and jump into the train. Opening sell order at 1,2759 might mean that the previous sell orders weren't open. Am I correct Danutz? If not could you please explain how did you interpret the entering rules

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi Danutz!I don't think that it is correctly to interpret free the rules on the given original strategy. If it is your first entry he should be at least on 100 pips from EMA 50. If you offer a new variant ,it is necessary to address first of all to the author of original strategy and the given thread.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi, you're right, impossible to stay all day long in front of the screen ! For the first entry, you need to check every 4 H. And sometime you don't need because the price is very far from EMA 50. (I don't wake up during nights ) For the next entries, i do the same... Every 4h when it is possible for me. I estimate the EMA 50 level (from one candle to the next, it doesn't move a lot) and i program a pending order. I think few pips from the rules entry is not a problem because we are looking for a big trend which may give us plenty of pips... And sometimes, you can catch a better price when you miss the entry according to the rules... it makes a balance

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Taken from some other threads such as Profit All Day System or the Trading Made Simple Thread, to address ranging periods you may want to consider banding the 50 EMA with the 50 EMA high and 50 EMA low averages. Or look at using 50 EMA Envelopes at around 0.3% to 0.5%. These will basically create a "no mans land" band around the 50 EMA. As the 5 EMA breaks out of the "no mans land" then grab your 100 pip entry rule. Even with these, due to market volatitilty and varying average daily ranges the bands might need to be adjusted. Maybe we look at a band of the 50 EMA+/- the ATR and look for the 5 EMA to break that range on way to the 100 pip entry. I had a hard time following the 15 candle rule as it didn't seem to make sense when to take start the 15 candle clock. Sounds like if your first signal cross fails, then you wait until it crosses how ever many times again until it can spend at least 15 candles on one side of the 50 EMA. Harder to program this into an EA or indicator. I think banding the range may be a better way IMO.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hello Mindaugas As you say the previous order from 1.2809 was not open and I considered a re-entry from 1.2996, that`s why I open a sell order at 1.2759. I don`t change the rule of the original strategy, but I use extra weekly pivot and trend lines for more acurracy, that`s why my chart has so many lines. Best Regards Danutz

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi, EURUSD, H4, chart shows 5 SMA crossed the 50 EMA from below.... if it goes 100 pips from 50 EMA... should we go for long?? Want to understand whether I've understood the strategy or not...

--- 帖子 #191 ---
The stop loss for the previous orders is 1.2923, so i do nothing untill the SL is touched. If it is touched, i wait for the price going 100 pips from 50 EMA after a candle close to enter.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Ok, I understand this.... now consider.... I don't have any position open and I wish to enter a trade..... I'll need to wait for the price hitting 100 pips from the 50 EMA and enter a long position after the candle closes... right?.... If this is right then, I think I've understood the system..... I'm not a native english.... So I tried to clarify each points specifically.... if I bored anyone.... sorry....

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Yes, if the candle when it closes is still 100 pips above 50 EMA, you can enter a long position.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I'm waiting of this position too.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
ruten, you may have forgotten or been mistaken at your 1.2880 level the EMA will be higher than it is now that's why the closed candle will not be out of the EMA +-100pips channel. In this case, according to the strategy you won't be allowed to execute the buy order. As I know, the EMA depends on the candles close prices. So it varies when price is moving.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
You are right

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I bought at the price of 1,2895.

I tried to trade with a different systems on charts from 1 to 15 minutes. After many unsuccessful attempts, I realized that each the trade (short or long) have a big stressful factor for me. Therefore this system with the least amount of transactions, suits me most.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I would like somebody to shed some light on a question I have, if somebody could help. Its about entry rules when the initial entry after a trend change was missed. http://shrani.si/t/R/ml/1D0rljuB/1.jpg The 1st entry after the trend change was missed - what now? Do I enter at the next touch of the candle which is 40 pips below the 1st entry? Or do I wait for the next touch 110 pips below? And when do I enter, at the touch or 100 pips below the touch since this will be "my 1st entry" though not the 1st entry of the overall trend?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
If i have missed the first entry, i would entry at the second, when the price touch EMA 50. It would be 40 pips below the 1st entry in your example.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Tnx Zebulon. I have a suggestion. I'm trying out renko charts in the last time and applied them to your system. I've used 20 pip boxes. For the last EUR/USD trade, just looking at the pip gain from 1st entry till the end of the trade, renko would have given 400 pips, while the normal 4H gave 360 pips. http://shrani.si/t/a/G0/x9m18lr/renko.jpg http://shrani.si/t/3o/MJ/1I0ShpdT/time.jpg Unfortunately I have only 2 months of data for renko, because its based on 1M charts. So I cant do more backtests. However, I'll try it on some forward testing from now on and see what happens. Another suggestion I have is not to reenter (2nd, 3rd, 4th... entry) the trade at the initial touch of the candle, but when the first candle crosses back over the EMA in the direction of the trend. This way, we dont lose the 100 pips in a situation, where the candle crossing the EMA also triggers the SL. Besides, if we wait for the cross back, this means the EMA went a bit more against the trend and therefore reenter from a better position - few more pips. http://shrani.si/t/2M/l6/1UCjMev/1.jpg

Hi Quezoy. Zebulon given us the rules of him full system. It's tell us when to open and close positions. And what? You can to change this rules, but it's to be another sys. I think ...

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi everybody! The night again, but I can't to sleep, because I must to tell you something... Especially for those, who wants to change the rules of the system by Zebulon Hm... Look at the chart bottom.... Really, - 1st point - we sold, 2nd point - we stopped sell and go to long (with MA target), then in 3rd point we stopped buy and go to short again, and so on up to point 6.... So, it is seems profitable, but we are need to be masters in market, that to see thees points in advance. is it possible? Yea, but only once you've mastered the skill of the PA, PPZ, swing, etc.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi Zebulon, Sorry, I am a newbie here and reading this thread with great interest. Please don't get me wrong when I ask you to explain, why you would make an entry while the gap is just 40 pips, well below 80 pips. In the previous thread the rule says at least 80 pips should be the distance/gap between the 1st. entry and the next EMA50 touch when an order can be placed. Shouldn't we strictly follow this rule even if the 1st. entry is missed? Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks! PeepCzar

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I was answering when i would enter if i had missed the first short entry. After that the price went north and touch the EMA50 40 pips above the first entry...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Zebulon, If the price touches 50 EMA before moving 80 pips from then entry, should we wait?? According to the rules, we should wait to hit our target... shouldn't we?? sohel

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Ruten I have a question, as I watch your trade explorer, why you close all trades? I mean Eur/usd and Eur/jpy. Only curious. Because of news? Regards

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Yes we wait if we didn't miss the first entry .

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi! I knew what you ask . Let Zebulon forgive me, but I'm a bit changed the rules. I can't see how I losing the profit on reverse motion. I decided to go out when the price breaks the trend line. Then to enter again. And now I exam of my skills. The more so that the result is overwhelming - 30% for the week! The Good enter is good results. Thanks Zebulon! As you can see it's my mistake! Confuse.... This system is working on 100% I need the patience.

Hy Ruten To draw trendline you can use Fractals, is more easy to see highs and lows. For me is working very good and is very easy. Regards

Hi Zebulon, I've already done so before seeing your post.... It seems that, I'm starting to understand the system...... One advice I may want... seeing my result (&gt;500 pips) with your system one pro forex trader advised me to demo trade for at least 6 months as my results are too good.... I just shared the result on facebook in a forex group where I've got the advice. You've already used your strategy for a good deal of time, I believe.... so what do you think?? How long should I demo trade with it before starting with real money??

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hey Mazi in my view the demo account is like playing a Call of duty game and real account is like going to Afghanistan. You should play with the demo just to master basics and go for live asap but, Don't even think about going with more than 50$ account even 50$ is too much because you will essentially blow it as anyone else did. The key point is to trade micro lots with pennies and your reward are points (pips) not the money because greed for more and more money is behind every busted account. I knew few people who triple their demo accounts which just boosted their egos then went for real and end up on the floor. Its completely different world to play with real hard earned money because with real account you cant control your emotions. So my advice is just go for it with as smallest tiniest micro tiny lots as you can find and just trade as much as you can.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
It is up to you ! But if you respect the rules , the results would be exactly the same. You can start with the samllest lot as possible.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hy Mazis12 After 1 month of demo I go live and in my first day of live trading I blow off my account, 2 weeks I don`t touch forex. Till now I blow off 10 real accounts. Now I trade demo and learn technical analysis. I can suggest a good book of technical analysis: Technical Analysis of The Financial Markets - John Murphy. Regards

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi Lame, Danutz &amp; Zebulon, Thanks all of you for your kind advice.... I, also with my little experience, would like to start with little account, microlots, low leverage (1:50 or 1:100 at most... I prefer the first option though) and 1-2% risk.... During trading in demo account, I also use the similar set up... I've blown up few demo accounts already.... until I found this thread.... I've also lost good deal of pips initially following this strategy (failing to use it properly)...... but now 3 positions in three pairs - 3 microlots... As lame said... I was enjoying gaining pips... I know, real world is different... when price moves opposite direction.... I can stick to the rule as it's a demo account... I think, I couldn't wait if the account would have been a real account.... so I need to develop skill and need to learn to be patient at the same time...... Thanks for the advice.... This kind of support boosts up the newbies like me....

Zebulon, Is it okay to set the SL as a trailing SL instead of fixing it to BE, so that at least there is some profit if something goes terribly wrong http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif Just ask for your opinion. Thanks... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Yes It is possible, but choose a large trailing SL, because we want to stay as longer as possible in the trend. But That is not the way i chose.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi, ZEBULON Don't you think those pairs are in the making of for a re-enter (11:40 GMT)? EUR/JPY : Up AUD/USD : Up USD/CAD : Down GBP/JPY : Up AUD/CAD : Up (Concerning JPY - and CHF - I only look for Up moves) Regards BBF PS: I guess you were in front of your TV last night ?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I only watch EUR/USD GBP/USD and EUR/JPY, and there was an opportunity to go long on EUR/JPY today, but the price was not far enough from the previous entry... Yes i have seen TV yesterday

--- 帖子 #229 ---
can you please let me know the price of the today oportunity to enter long? thank you

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Sometimes, A chart is better than words...

--- 帖子 #231 ---
hi, zebulon, firstly thx for your sharing! great job! can i ask what are the five horizontal lines in your chart, at the last five candles ? thx again!

--- 帖子 #232 ---
That's Pivot points...

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi Zebulon and Friends, I went through the thread and liked your system for its simplicity. Would like to demo it for the months to come. I entered long EURJPY yesterday as I didn't have any trade from the previous entry.... Cheers to all.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
SUBSCRIBED

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hi Zebulon, I bought again on a retrace at 1.30695 and move up the SL to 1.29695 (100 pips below the new entry). Is this correct? Please confirm. Thanks... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Good job The perfect price for me was 1.3055

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Am I correct?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Not yet ! For me, EMA50 is at 100.40 I will go short if the candle closes under 99.40

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Yes, I agree. Just wanted to say that it seems it could become an entry position.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Price is already reached 99.285... It's a short entry, right?? N.B. 28 minutes was remaining for closing of candle..... after 15 minutes... price retraced above 99.40.... so for me.... more patience is needed.... I've not entered into a position though.... luckily... price is moving upwards on new candle... learned a good lesson... wait till the last minute.... respect the rules.... as Zebulon told several times.....I tried to obey every rule as far as I understood... I've now understood it with live experience.... finally, no entry position for eur/jpy yet....

--- 帖子 #241 ---
But the candle didnt close. However, I'm short from now on

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I'm not ! Price didn't close under (EMA 50 -100 pips)

--- 帖子 #243 ---
yes, I got impatient

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Like Quezoy ,I was also impatient and I was about to go short... But when I read the comment from zebulon again, I found that I should wait till the candle close at more than 100 pips from 50 EMA... So I refrained myself from entering short position with a sad mindset... but at the end, I was paid off for following the rules.... I think, it's natural to be impatient for newbies... we should learn to be patient, whatever rules we follow.....Thanks Zebulon, you're a great help for us..

--- 帖子 #245 ---
hi zeb is the charting u used a free one? where is the link? care to share? i have been wondering how would you always catch the entry when the moment the price touches the 50ma but the h4 candle yet to close up? and unless one is in front the screen at most times, otherwise it is kind of impossible to catch the (moment) entry if like me working full time? wonder how to overcome the above ??? u r just good

--- 帖子 #246 ---
got a mini account for this system =) i only focusing on EURUSD, today's my first long trade at the EMA. Lets dance!

--- 帖子 #247 ---
You're wellcome ! Yes usually we are impatient because we are used to shortest time frames as 5 or 15 min. Here one candle needs 4H to build. I think these 4H candles are more significant and we have more time. We don't need to have the nose on the road to drive our trades, more distance allows us a better view to control the direction ...

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi, i don't know if i can give my broker's name here ! I'm not in front of the screen all day of course ! I place a pending order because EMA 50 is not varrying a lot during 4H. Sometimes, i miss the touch and i have a second touch or a third at the same level...

--- 帖子 #249 ---
pls pm me tq.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
hi zeb pls. comment... on the entries if i were trade this pair. the big box is 100 pips the small 80. the 1st entry is the bottom line due 100 pips away from ma50. the 2nd entry is the top line due 80 pips away from 1st entry and touch the ma50. tq n cheers

--- 帖子 #251 ---
hi zeb another one on gu... 1st entry shown on the line. no 2nd entry yet due price didn't touch ma50. thanks for your time.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
hi zeb this my last query for the morning b4 going to work. sori 4 d trouble. 1st entry was the bottom line, but it was stopped out 2nd entry or reentry was the top line. the price has not touched ma50 so no 3rd entry. just hope your jan result was excellent? have tried this trading method on other pairs like a-u? a-j? what gold and silver? good day and happy trading.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
yes !!

--- 帖子 #254 ---
yes !!

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Yes, good entry ! But i didn't trade this pair. I trade only EUR/USD, GBP/USD, EUR/JPY. I had not enough time to test other pairs and to adapt the parameters size (box 100 pips 80 pips??? EMA 50 or 60???)

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Zebulon, Do you think is good for EU to open Buy position? thanks

--- 帖子 #257 ---
If i had not enter yet, i would place a enter long at 1.3084

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Do you open a new position, if there is opportunity, on Friday? thanks

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Yes !!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I was on hollidays yesterday, and i have missed this good entry on GBP/USD at 1.5732

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Actually, 2 open trades (long) on EUR/USD at 1.2907 and 1.3055 338+ 190 = 528 pips and maybe more next days...

--- 帖子 #262 ---
GBP/USD : 2 open trades (long) at 1.5521 and 1.5732 actually 363 + 152 = 515 pips....

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi Zebulon, Have you got a chance to look at EJ? We still need to wait for the 15 candles before jump in, don't we? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif Cheers...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I've missed it too as I was at hospital with my sick 10 months baby girl.....

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I'm sorry! The children, that is the best we have!

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Yes, i wait for the 15 candles, we'll see if the 15th is 100 pips away from 50 EMA...

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hello Zebulon Only one question, are you trade this strategy live? Best Regards Danutz

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Yes i do

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hey,Zebulon Can I use this strategy by using daily candle? As I am working and can not access internet during daytime. Is there any modification in the strategy required? Plz..help me..as this is very nice strategy that uses momentum..

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Using daily candles is possible, but parameters will be certainly different. You will have to adapt EMA size and the 100 pips ....

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Zebulon, In my chart it seems 3 more candles, then obviously I have to check the 100 pips gap. How about in yours? Please let me know when you're in. Thanks for your help, mate... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I look the actual candle which will close in 2H30.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Zebulon, your thread has sparked some of my own ideas around an hrly variation. Before i post the details, please let me know if you are ok for me to do this?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
yes, tell us about it !

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi Chow Clown!I wait with the big impatience your hourly variant as I too search for optimum parameters to adapt the fine Zebulon strategy for the TF 1H.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
ok, work in progress and not exhaustively tested yet but some food for thought perhaps... Still using the EMA(50) but with the upper/lower band scaled down to 25 pips. The key seems to be the strength of the close of the signal candle, not only closing above/below the band but also near the high of the signal candle. The signal candle is then fibbed to derive SLs and target. T1 being 1:1, T2 1:2. I've also used the fib tool to show the 80% level which could be used to quickly check the strength of the close. EU and GU examples below. I'll be forward testing mainly on EU. (ignore the EU short trade in the chart; another strat.)

--- 帖子 #277 ---
...possible short setting up, just need to see how the current candle closes. SR zones show a reasonable 'gap'.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
just my thought, zeb. it would be nice to stay your trading method in one piece, instead mixing up more flavors like new indy &amp; lower tf. once done, others might follow suit with more spices! chow, perhaps a new thread of your own trading method even thou it may contain zeb original idea.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yes, fair enough.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Zebulon. Thank you very much for this interesting strategy. I'm following your thread a few days ago and today I made my first entry in EURUSD at 1.30878 with SL at 1.31878. Attached image. I don't take previous orders in EURUSD because I didn't the strategy? Is correct my entry at this point? Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
This system seems to be dangerous in the period from May to August 2011, even with the 15 bars for the trading range ?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
doarisu, for you -0.66% is dangerous for your account? If you compare with results from September 2011 to date, this means nothing.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
thaks 4 highligting it, pls sugest a solution to it?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Yes it's correct if you mean entry long at 1.31878

--- 帖子 #285 ---
The enemy is the range, but we can avoid a part of it. But i don't understand why you have losses with more than 120 pips, impossible with the strategy...

--- 帖子 #286 ---
What is the maximum possible loss with this strategy from your experience? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/editor/smilie.gif

--- 帖子 #287 ---
i mean 120 pips loss for a trade ....

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Good days for EUR/USD, actually 3 trades opened and +592 pips !

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi Zebulon! I have a question. If we will assume someone only starts to trade on your strategy, and he still doesn't have open trades, whether that will be a sufficient condition for opening of the first trade the first closing of the previous candle more than 100 pips from EMA50 or it is necessary to take history in attention and enter only after the previous trade on backtest has been closed on SL?. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
As you can see, if i have missed the first entry (candle close 100 pips from 50 EMA), i would take the 2d entry when price touch 50 EMA. I prefer jump in the train even if i didn't take it at the beginning.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
good and simple system. i usually trade yen pairs on lower TF's. but i might give this a look. i usually define the trend by looking for stochastics 14 hitting 80/20 instead of an arbitrary pip value one thing i might look at with this is defining my entries on a lower TF and being more aggressive. throw up a RSI 7 and keep a lookout for a 50 cross. then use 1 hour TF with CCI and DMI to go with the 4 hour trend. how much back testing and trading have you done for this system? sorry if u covered that already

--- 帖子 #292 ---
good suggest, perhaps you can open your own thread (once done, let me know) incorporating zeb's concept... so that this thread won't be mixing up with other indicators... that possible could confuse the original trading method to other traders.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
i'm too lazy to start my own thread. this seems like a good way to stick a dart on a trend though.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
true.... Please, let's try to understand and use the main idea..... if anyone has any suggestion, can share with the thread owner by PM or can start new thread... in this way.... it'll remain clean, at least for the newbies like me....

--- 帖子 #295 ---
zeb 2 mida-touches on the 2nd n 3rd entries! unbelievable! cant imaging how you do that! right spot, right timing! question: you dont seem to consider the candlestick formation, like both entries were made even thou they were bear candles? or shall one wait for bull candles to form as in this case a uptrend? thanks for your time. cheers

--- 帖子 #296 ---
The numbers represent the net difference . The stops are in correspondence of the horizontal lines .

--- 帖子 #297 ---
No,i don't care about bear or bull candle...

--- 帖子 #298 ---
noted, thx.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi Zebulon, Have you hit S/L in any pair?? I've got hit.... in all three pairs.... in two pairs for seemingly my fault or not following the rule properly and in one pair seemingly following the rule properly.... and in all three pairs, after hitting S/L price again moved in the duration of my position.... EU- two positions still on rally.... one position- the entry one... got hit for my fault..... GU-- got hit and no position is open now.... EJ pair is my most loosing pair.... lost 200 pips in 2 positions...... my entry wasn't 100% accurate though.... Are all the three pairs (you're using for this strategy) still in a trend?? specially eu and gu??

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Here are the trades from the beginning of 2012 : EUR/USD : 3 open trades at 1.2907, 1.3055 and 1.3184, no SL has been touched

--- 帖子 #301 ---
GBP/USD : 2 trades open at 1.5521 and 1.5732. No SL has been touched

--- 帖子 #302 ---
EUR/JPY : buy at 99.86, when price was 200 pips up, i have moved SL to BE. SL touched at BE. After a range period (5 EMA cross 3 times 50 EMA), i have wait for 15 candles before buying at 102.68. Hope this can help !!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I have 2 trades open for EUR/USD pair.... I lost the first trade for not following the rules.... with profit though.... I wanted to know about the GBP/USD pair specially.... It was promising and it seems that it wants to reverse.... at one point I had unrealized about $30 profit with a single microlot position... then I had another position with missing a valid long position... but with the S/L being hit.... realized gain is $6..... I'm just learning now.... is it normal scenario in forex trading or I've done anything wrong.... one thing... I haven't learned to analyze news... so I don't follow news yet.... so zebulon, what do you think?? if it's beyond the scope of discussion in this thread, you can just ignore it.. thanks Mazis12

--- 帖子 #304 ---
sori to hear your 200 pips loss on 1st trade. may your 2nd trade to profit! cheers

--- 帖子 #305 ---
It's not 200 pips loss, at BE it's 0 pips loss

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Ok, I think, I've got my fault detected here.... as we learn from our mistakes... I want to share my mistake... Pls Zebulon... tell me I'm right or wrong here.... after missing a second trade at 1.5732, I entered a long again when the price touched the 50 EMA at 1.5792 which was not a valid entry point.... right?? for this my S/L at 1.5692 got a hit so did the S/L of first trade as it moved to same level.... so there is no position open for me here.... Zebulon, I'm still missing the entry points by about 30-40 pips.... what can I do for it???? I'm trying to ride on time.... every time it's making the difference

--- 帖子 #307 ---
When we are not enough patient, SL give us frustation each time they are touched. Don't forget we are looking for big moves with 5 or 6 entries which will give us plenty of pips. When little moves brings me little pips, it is good for me, i wait for the next start. Second thing, i think all the news are in the price. I don't need to analyse news. I just know that at 2.30 pm, we could have a move, maybe a big one, maybe up, maybe down. I don't know. But i know what i will do according to the price level.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
My 15th candle closed at 102.82 and I missed the next candle by 21 pips.... I entered the position then.... for that I got caught the S/L..... so I think, as I missed the entry point, I shouldn't have entered into the trade.... right??

--- 帖子 #309 ---
If i had missed the entry at 1.5732, i would have entered at 1.5792 like you and i would have 100 pips loss with no regrets. I'm also missing some entries. i place pending orders to avoid it...

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Yes, if i miss an entry, i wait for the price comming back to my entry point, i don't buy at a higher level. Or i'm waiting for a new entry...

--- 帖子 #311 ---
happy to hear that.... not for your missing entries... but for the right execution by me for the trade at 1.5792, resulting in loss though which is of course a part of trading... I'm trying to learn to place the pending orders... I've got the position in EUR/USD pair at 1.3180 by a pending order... Now how should I look at the charts to place such.... at the end of every 4 hour candle?? then place the pending order after opening of next candle or what?? just.... what's the proper time of placing pending order when price moves toward the 50 EMA??

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Ok, I got it... thanks....another question.... you've told that.... you wait for the price coming back to entry point or for a new entry.... about coming back to the entry point.... do you enter into the trade when price come right up to the level of entry point by a pending order or what??

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Yes, a real example, i have missed the entry on EUR/USD at 1.3184 february the 10th. I have placed a pending order at 1.3184 which has been touched february the 13th...

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi friends. I took a long in GBP/USD at 1.5731, so the stop is placed at 1.5631. If the current bar close below 1.5673 (100 pips below the 50 sma), should I close the long and open a short? Thanks for your work Zebulon.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
No, i let the SL at 1.5631. I will not go short if my SL is not touched.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hello Zebulon On GBP/USD is a good entry for short on 1.5666? Thanks Regards DANUTZ

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Then, do I place a pending order for sell in 1.5631?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
For me, the last candle has closed at 1.56757 and EMA 50 is 1.5675. So, i prefer waiting and see how are the next candles...

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I wait the SL is touched, and then i wait for the close of the candle to see if we are 100 pips from EMA50

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Zebulon, I just wanted to ask the question that-- as the price of EU is approaching my S/L 1.3080... (current price is 1.3100).... should I prepare to go short?.... (I'm asking it not being impatient... but trying to understand the process).... before asking, I refreshed the page and I saw your last 2 posts so as you mentioned in the previous post.... I need to wait till the S/L being hit at 1.3080 and then if price closes &gt;100 pips below 50 EMA then go for short..... It's early midnight in my timezone.... so as the price nearing a trigger point, how should I monitor it and get into action in right time?? what would you do in such a situation, zebulon?? Pending order??? or try to monitor 4 hourly to enter in a possible/probable opening trade???

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi zebulon, My EMA 50 is 1.5770 and price already closed beyond 100 pips (1.5667).. to be exact, it is 103 pips.. should I wait or go for short position?? How could your EMA 50 is 1.5675? should it be 1.5775?? Mazis12

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Zebulon, this system is for trading in trend.... here the price movement about 100 pips from the 50 EMA from opposite side will indicate the start of a new trend.... am I right?? In your post no 115, you've told that in GBP/USD pair, 5 SMA crossed 50 EMA several times.... so the pair is ranging.... so...let me check here.... EUR/USD pair, 5 SMA crossed 3 times in 8 days.... is it ranging now or what am I missing here??

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I have always a stop loss 100 pips from my last order so my trades are closed on EUR/USD : from 1.2907 and 1.3055 and 1.3184, i win 106 pips. Not so bad and waiting for a big move. It is also night for me, so as the actual candle is not 100 pips from EMA 50 i go to sleep ! I'm not afraid when 1 or 2 candles are alive when i'm sleeping or playing tennis. That will not change a lot, especially during asian session which is not usually very strong.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
On GBP/USD,my EMA50 is actually 1.5771. My last entry was 1.5732, so the SL was not touched. In the case you couldn't enter at 1.5732, so you had enter around 1.5795 and your SL has been touched. Anyway, the price was almost 100 pips from EMA 50 so i prefer wainting for the next candles.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I consider price is ranging when 5 SMA crossed 3 times 50 EMA since i have no more position opened.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I've also won around 100 pips in EUR/USD .... Actually I belong to asian resion so when I go to bed, New york session continues and at later part of the night NZD and Aussie session start.... I think, I'll also learn to not to be afraid of not watching those couple of candles or more during sleeping time.... As my candle closed outside and went beyond that on the next candle for about 19 pips, I put a pending order and went to sleep.....I just wanted to literally follow the rules... now reading your reply, I'm now thinking, have I done another mistake here .... I'm working hard to get hold of the system.... tonight I had sleep for only 3 hours.... but, in the long run it may hurt my health... hope, I'll learn quickly-- to skip couple of candles from watching to get my night sleep properly .....

--- 帖子 #327 ---
i think this is a good idea, i will enter with 2 trades, one for running and one closed when profit is +100 pips

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi everybody ! Thank you very much Zebulon for your very simple and very interesting thread. I also agree with APeng about MM and to make entry with 2 lots...as i did, my first entry has been long EUR/JPY at 102.92, i think i followed the rules...Zebulon can you confirm it ? When i had some spare time, i will see if this strategy works with other pairs Good trades to all of you !

--- 帖子 #329 ---
First of all thanks for a simple system! Wondering which pairs you choose. Obviously the trending pairs, but do you do any further analysis before entry. E.g. Not a goog idea to choose a pair at daily,weekly or monthly highs/resistance for long or lows for short? Would appreciate any assistance or tools to determine that. Sorry, If this is too newbie! Grant

--- 帖子 #330 ---
nzd/usd looks promising too...tonight i hope i can give you backtest of it

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I'm demo trading with EUR/USD, GBP/USD and EUR/JPY pair as Zebulon instructed.... Waiting to see how NZD/USD pair behaves in your back-test very eagerly..... Thanks Mazis12

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hello all. Great strategy Zebulon. Thanks and Congratulations on all the positive feedback. I'm looking at the 4hr chart on EUR/USD. My chart has a bit of a doji going on at the moment (I appreciate other charts may look different) so if price closes in the next half hour at around 1.3070 (100 pips below the MA) I should be going short. However, looking at the strongish S &amp; R at 1.3030 I think I might wait until that line is broken with a close (the doji should vanish by then hopefully) What do you guys/girls think.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I'm short now on EUR/USD

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I'm also short on EUR/USD...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
can you please tell me what was your entry on the sell eurusd?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
ok i manual backtest NZD/USD starting 01/2011 : reward 910 pips but as you can see almost all of it come from the last entry, that would be still open at this time...tomorow i will see what happens using APENG idea results: -100 -100 -100 -9+ 374 -100 -82 -29+ 13 -100+ 398 -79+ 213 -81 -100+ 792 Acumulate: -100 -200 -300 -309+ 65 -35 -117 -146 -133 -233+ 165+ 86+ 299+ 218+ 118+ 910

--- 帖子 #337 ---
i am also short on eur/usd from 1.3078, when last 4h closed..

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I have sold at 1.3061

--- 帖子 #339 ---
This time, I'll try to act according to the rule more precisely.... I entered the position with a pending order.... just to clarify one thing....In my chart, 5 SMA crossed the 50 EMA line 3 times when I had no open trade.... should I consider that a range period.... I asked it earlier.... you've answered..... my question is... if I consider it to be a range... I should have waited for 15 candles uncrossed and the price 100 pips beyond the 50 EMA to enter into a new trade position.... but I didn't wait for that.... I entered at10th candle with other condition fulfilled.... Did I do any wrong here?? In your last chart screenshot... 5 SMA crossed the 50 EMA three times in 9 days (5th feb to 14th feb)..... I think, you didn't consider it to be range period ... rather a trend reversal....is it so?? Thanks Mazis12

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Yes in this case i wait for 15 candles uncrossed

--- 帖子 #341 ---
between the 2d and the 3rd cross, we have more than 15 candles, so it is not a range period...

--- 帖子 #342 ---
zebulon we have almost a sell setup for gbpusd right? as soon as it reached the 100 pips from the 50 EMA correct?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Good morning everybody ! SL touched on 101.92.. - 200pips.. Good trades to all of you ps. i am short on EUR/USD 1.3078 and long on USD/JPY at 78.35 (i know it is not on Zebulon list, but it was in my watch list for other reasons and my entry was made under Zebulon parameters)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
No, because the trade is still open from 1.5732

--- 帖子 #345 ---
My SL ( 101.68) has not been touched . But i don't like this situation, being long on EUR/JPY and short on EUR/USD, they are often correlated. I think Greek situation is a big reason to push down the euro, so i will certainly have a winning side (EUR/USD in my opinion) and a loosing side (EUR/JPY)...

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi zebulon, Thanks for sharing your EMA method. You seem to have a high strike rate and excellent RR and I was wondering what % risk you put on each trade personally? Also am I not mistaken that your stop will not be taken out even if the price moves past it over the weekend as the markets are closed to retail? Thanks

--- 帖子 #347 ---
i had the same feeling as yours, and since my entry was not perfect...i get bust! anyway i am trading with microlots so it is less painful Hope our short on eur/usd will be good. 1/2 position sold at 1.2978 so in worst case i will BE.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Good and seems a nice system. i will try it in my live account...

--- 帖子 #349 ---
hi to all i know about this system for a while now but not using it but i follow the thread you guys are wonderful i will join you now on

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Sell GU at 1.5720 see what is the result later.....very interesting

--- 帖子 #351 ---
i was just looking at the same trade, but the 100+ pip candle kinda scares me.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Can I ask why you sold GU @ 1.5720?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I failed to correlate this trade with the dancing EMA strategy.....

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I just follow the rule only... not sure correct or not anything wrong? Attached file is the chart.... i enter the trade when the price is move below 100pips from ema 50.... any comment...

--- 帖子 #355 ---
My friend you are supposed to SELL when the price closes 100 pips below the 50 MA. Buy when the price closes ABOVE the MA...

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I think weisiong00 did sell below the 50MA but the MA was at around 1.5800 so should have sold at 1.5700 not 1.5720. Pulled the trigger a bit too early according to the rules. Just as well really, as stop loss about to be hit at 1.5800 (lets hope it reverses before) Regards Paul

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I'm thinking of getting into the EUR/USD trade as I missed the original entry. Price almost at the 50MA on pullback. Should I wait for an actual touch of the MA (It's almost there but not quite) or could I try a little earlier and hope it's reached it's highest before reversal. Your comments would be appreciated. Regards Paul

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Sold the EUR/USD @ 1.3135. Missed the first drop of 100 pips so entered on retouch of the 50MA. Not sure if this meets the rules by Zebulon. Will see what happens.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
With any luck price is bouncing off the 50.0 fib level from the high of 9th Feb and will now continue down! Time will tell...

--- 帖子 #360 ---
it did hit 100 pips SL and trade closed right?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Yes SL hit for EUR/USD. TRades still alive on GBP and EUR JPY...

--- 帖子 #362 ---
[quote=zebulon;5395392]Yes SL hit for EUR/USD. Hi Zebulon! Since 6.02 MA5 three times crossed EMA 50 on EU.Means we should wait 15 candles without crossing since 17.02.16.00. Time of my broker GMT+2. I am right?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
[quote=fxforever;5397830] I count crosses when all trades are closed. So i have only one cross since my last trade...

--- 帖子 #364 ---
For the trade you're mentioning here.... suppose anyone hasn't entered any position at your level and come to the chart at the stage of price touching the 50 EMA..... should one enter at the touch or wait for generating fresh new signal at price closing beyond 100 pips from 50 EMA And for anyone who had trade at the beginning of original trade (where you started) but got S/L hit... like me.....could I enter the long trade when price touched 50 EMA at the last occasion as seen in the screenshot?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
In this case, i would enter when price is touching the 50 EMA .

--- 帖子 #366 ---
When my SL is hit, i wait for a new signal (price closing beyond 100 pips from 50 EMA) .

--- 帖子 #367 ---
A new buy signal for GBP/USD is coming at around 1.5873 if my current candle closes here in 1 and 1/2 hour......I'll definitely have to watch for price action in 1 and 1/2 hour..... still now I'm missing the good entries which is the most important part of trading with this strategy..... because more than couple of trade hit S/L for me where Zebulon's were safe...just because of entry at the right time by Zebulon and not mine......

--- 帖子 #368 ---
very important what you said..same happens to me, entry at 102.90 EUR/JPY in spite of 102.62, and get ousted at 101.92 and after that (101.78) go up and up...we have to be patient and if we missed the entry, wait and see if the price touch again the price and if not, wait until next signal.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
but i think that if you want to follow the rules, you shouldn´t enter at 1.5873, but would have to wait price hit EMA50 1.5812 or above (since the proper entry was at 1.5732) Zebulon am i right? Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Shouldn't you also consider the candle count at least equal to 15 between the SL being hit and the 100-pip gap?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi zebulon. You will open a long trade at the close of the candle EUR / USD ?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I want to refer you to the post no 366-- quoted below Previous original trade got hit S/L..... So I'll go for new signal-- price closing beyond 100 pips from 50 EMA..... hope I'm right....

--- 帖子 #373 ---
sorry but if Zebulon enter at 1.5732 (post 344), SL haven´t be touched yet (lowest price has been 1.5642) so i guess it is still open if he has the same price as I...anyway Zebulon will answer us when it will be back ! Good luck !

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Actually my original trade got hit S/L as my entry was a little bit higher..... in this scenario... entry should be done with the generation of a new signal by crossing price by 100 pips from the 50 EMA... this is what I understood....Let's see whether I'm right or wrong....

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Yes, my last entry was 1.5732 and my SL has not been touched. So if i would have miss it, i would enter when price will touch 50 EMA...Or better, at 1.5732

--- 帖子 #376 ---
No because trades are still open

--- 帖子 #377 ---
EUR/USD : i'm long now at 1.3260 since the candle has closed more than 100 pips from 50 EMA

--- 帖子 #378 ---
In my chart that bar finished at 1.3242

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Different brokers have different 4H candles. It depends at what time each candle begins...

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I made backtest since 2011-01-01 You can see it: http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-danc...tegyTester.htm and transactions: http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-dancingema/1/fx1.png http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-dancingema/1/fx2.png http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-dancingema/1/fx3.png http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-dancingema/1/fx4.png I did not implement SMA5 condition, but I excluded summer holidays (July and August). I think that is the same. But tell me if I wrong. I saw previous backtest, but I think that shorter period is better in this case. You can see that this strategy worked at second half of 2011 only. Why? Each transaction has the same size - 2% of the $10000. -- Tom http://www.forexguns.com

--- 帖子 #381 ---
My candle closed at 1.3262...... I entered at 1.3263.... missed by 1 pip this time..... Now I'm monitoring regularly 4 hourly..... trying to cope up with this system....

--- 帖子 #382 ---
If I'm not wrong.... the last candle (entry candle) Zebulon is indicating was a bearish candle.... my entry candle was bullish candle.... so it varies broker to broker.... we just need to confirm that price closes beyond 100 pips from 50 EMA in our own trading timezone and act accordingly, don't we?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I have indicated this candle but i mean "the open of this candle"... I didn't know when i open the trade if the candle will be bullish or not... But i agree with you, we just need to confirm that price closes beyond 100 pips from 50 EMA in our own trading zone.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
1) I think EUR/USD GBP/USD and EUR/JPY are highly correlated. And we can avoid more losses and increase this strategy with this new rule : don't go short on a pair when the 2 others are still open long. The last short trade on EUR/USD would not be open with this rule. 2) i have to forget all my opinions to the greek situation and consequences on euro as all politic or economics news : all is in the charts and i have just to watch them ...

--- 帖子 #385 ---
maybe it's time to put all your all trading rules in one place like your 1st post to ease understanding your method by new traders. just my 2 cents. happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I like your system very much Zebulon! I tried looking at all the pages and posts, and I thought I saw someone saying they made an EA for this (I think it was done in Java), but I didn't see one for Metadrader 4. If someone has already created an EA for MT4 for this trading system, would you please let me know what page it's on, and if no one has created one yet, would it be possible for someone to do so and post it here? Thanks in advance! Regards, Paul

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Yes ! i wil do it

--- 帖子 #388 ---
i don't use EA or MT4 but i think the problem is to implement the 5 SMA condition.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
If you tell what do you exactly mean with this condition then I will add it to my EA. For example: 2 crosses in 10 candles turn off EA for 10 next candles. or 3 crosses in 20 candles turn off EA for 20 next candles. But look at my post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...03#post5402203 and screens of transactions. Do you see mistakes? -- Tom http://www.forexguns.com

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thank you Tom for your backtest, but the EMA5 is crucial for the purpose of this strategy, because it doesn´t work on range. and the EMA5 crossing the EMA50 is supposed to advert us of this (most of the time). Can you implement it as following: if EMA5 cross EMA15 three times since last entry (with no more than 15 4H candles between each EMA5 crossing EMA50), we can´t entry even if others conditions apply..in that case, we have to wait for 15 4h candles before entering (if others conditions are still valid) ? I don´t know if it is very well explained..feel free to ask me..hope that at least it is correct ? Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #391 ---
EMA5? Zebulon wrote about SMA5. EMA15? or EMA50? Correct me. Since last entry if we have 3 crosses SMA5 and EMA50 (no more than 15 candles between each cross) then we wait 15 candles. Is it OK?

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I removed condition "Since last entry". It is wrong. Conditions is: If we have 3 crosses SMA5 and EMA50 (no more than 15 candles between each cross) then we wait 15 candles. http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-dancingema/2/fx5.png Yes, it rescue us from range, but it has worse result: http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-danc...tegyTester.htm 1. Without SMA5, but excluded summer holidays: http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-danc...tegyTester.htm 2. With SMA5 and with summer holidays: http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-danc...tegyTester.htm 3. With SMA5 and excluded summer holidays: http://www.forexguns.com/fxg/bt-danc...tegyTester.htm Summary: The better is number 1 :-( -- Tom http://www.forexguns.com

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi Tom, I backtested this manually using Alpari UK and got these results from January 2011 up to last Friday... EU - +4065 EY - +3277 AU - +505 This was using: - 100+ close past 50 MA for EP - No trade if 5 MA crossed 50 MA 3 or more times within 30 candles (if so wait 15 candles until next entry) - No trade if 5 MA crossed 50 MA 2 or more times within 10 candles (if so wait 15 candles until next entry) My money management was different however to that stated by zebulon. For EU I used 2 lots for entry taking 1 lot profit at +200 at which point I move the SL to BE and letting the second lot run. If the 2nd lot hits +500 close trade. I am stopped out if the trade still runs and moves past the opposite side of 50 MA by 100 pips... I had no re-entries on a 50 MA re-touch... For EY and AU I did the same but took profit at +150 and +400...

--- 帖子 #394 ---
hi tom a good idea! just that... why don't you open a new/your thread to discuss this ea incorporating zeb's trading method... with this then making zeb's thread staying clean with his original concept and no mixing with other concept. what do you think? my 2 cents opinion. cheers

--- 帖子 #395 ---
sorry it is SMA5 and EMA50..should read what i wrote before posting it !

--- 帖子 #396 ---
zeb hope u trade well. i am a slow learner maybe due to full time work and family a quick question... someone could make a loss on 1/ short entry. then he missed his a 2/ long entry. now can he make the next long entry (since he missed his 1st long entry)? if so, is it 100 pips from 50ma or how? pls. clarify. thanks for your time. cheers

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I am new at this forum, and I am sorry if i made something wrong. I think that backtesting is usefull for manual trading. It shows history problems. I fear using strategy if I see that it has generated looses half year. Maybe I do not understand strategy. Thats why I wrote at this forum backtesting result. I will make new thread with results of mogulmedia modification. Is it OK? -- Tom http://www.forexguns.com

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I made new thread with results: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...73#post5405573

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Thanks to all of you and to tom to do the best to increase this strategy ! I think backtesting with an EA is a good way to find the best parameters. What i mean with the 5 SMA cross is : if EMA5 cross EMA15 three times since last loss (with no more than 15 4H candles between each EMA5 crossing EMA50), we can´t entry even if others conditions apply..in that case, we have to wait for 15 4h candles before entering (if others conditions are still valid). But this rule is not writed in the stone. If backtest tells us it is better with 20 candles or 2 crosses, we will adapt... I 'm very confident with this strategy, the trend brings pips. To avoid range periods, i think 5 SMA cross rule and no opposite trade rule (if we don't go short on a pair when the 2 others are still open long) will help a lot...

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I look history, the short entry is a mistake as the long entry at 1.5732 is still open. If i have missed it, i would enter at the touch of EMA 50 at 1.5791

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Why long is still open?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
I know... different candles H4 :-(

--- 帖子 #403 ---
o my mistake on the said 1/ short entry. u very sharp eye.. sifu noted on the rest... thanks. chow... happy pipping

--- 帖子 #404 ---
According to this....in my chart GBP/USD touched 50 EMA at 1.5793..... price is approaching S/L at 1.5693..... if it hits S/L then I have to wait for a fresh new signal of price going 100 pips beyond 50 EMA, right?? sorry, if it seems a double question.... in one of my previous post, I asked similar but a hypothetical question... but now I'm facing the situation... that's why...I'm just making sure that I'm doing right thing.... P.S. I'm eager to implement this system in my real account... that's why I'm asking question in every possible step.... I'm newest in this arena as I've never traded in a real account yet....This is 4th month of my demo trading.... P.S.S. My S/L for GBP/USD got hit after submitting the post. Luckily 1.5632 is far away still... so Zebulon's long is still open....this signifies the importance of a good entry point....Whatever, it's part of trade......

--- 帖子 #405 ---
5 SMA for EUR/USD is taking a saw tooth appearance.....it seems that price is moving sideways..... no ranging signal in this system, though..... it's a period of consolidation.....

--- 帖子 #406 ---
In your previous question, it was to jump in the train, now it is to go on the opposite direction : i will not go short until 1.5632 especially if eur/usd and eur/jpy are still open long

--- 帖子 #407 ---
About jumping in the train... I understood that part......I was talking about going long again in gbp/usd.... if in this scenario.... EUR/USD and EUR/JPY are still open long.....and if I want to go long in GBP/USD when price reverse after it's down course..... how should I proceed?? Fresh long signal... And if gbp/usd hits the 1.5632 and proceeds further..... then would you go short even if eur/usd and eur/jpy are still open long.....

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I will go short on GBP/USD if : 1) gbp/usd hits the 1.5632 AND 2) eur/usd hits the 1.3160 AND 3) the 4H candle close 100 pips from 50 EMA To go long, (i'm long from 1.5732) as the 2 other pairs are still open long, i would go long now at 1.5668 which is a better level than 1.5732 with a SL at 1.5632. So i would risk only 36 pips.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Good news from EUR/USD, i took my profit (100 pips) on 1 trade since i take 2 trades, the other one is running from 1.3260. On GBP/USD, 2 trades still open from 1.5521 and from 1.5732 On EUR/JPY, 1 trade is still open from 102.68, more than 400 pips

--- 帖子 #410 ---
With no trade open at GBP/USD (S/L getting hit) and open long trade at EUR/USD, missed EUR/JPY uptrend..... I went for long for GBP/USD at 1.5677..... as this is not in the rule but you told in the above mentioned post... a logical approach in your mentioned scenario..... can I enter such a trade if I want to stick to this strategy?? Price is going up now.... about entry at 1.5668 with 36 pips risk.... good entry point.... as price is going up...soon 5 SMA is going to touch and cross 50 EMA if this trend continues..... so can the touch of 5 SMA with 50 EMA be another entry point provided that a long entry is still open.....

--- 帖子 #411 ---
You need more space between 2 trades. Even if you have entered at a very good price, you should wait for a new signal which is at least at 1.5732 + 80 pips and follow the strategy...

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Congratulations !! long on USD/JPY from 78.35 long on EUR/USD from 1.3253 long on GBP/USD from 1.5671 (since i missed 1.5521, i found this entry the best one after confirmation of floor on 1.5650 aprox) Short on USD/CHF from 0.9010 all positions are profitable but USD/CHF, although i have to say my first 2 operations based on Zebulon strategy were loss... EUR/JPY i missed it since i was long on 102.92, SL touched and went up +500 pips now !! By the way i think that the SL should be put 100 pips from the theorical entry, not the real one (if it is not the same)..if the difference is too important, better not to enter Good trading to all of you!

--- 帖子 #413 ---
congratulation traders! zeb trading method is gr8! regardless +/- trades, i think it would nice if traders post their charts so that others would benefit... tiring after work... happy pipping

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Heres my chart =) i only Trade solely the EURUSD, currently 200 pips positive.. the yellow line is where the EMA has to reach before i can take another entry..

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Zebulon, Would you consider this in your strategy?? after reading this, I started doing this.... but it'll cost more when price moves against you.... so one need to think about his money management whether one can afford the loss or not... My last EUR/USD and GBP/USD entry were by 2 trades each.....after price moving 100 pips my way, I closed 1 trade.... now the remaining trade has 200 pips..... should I keep the s/l where it is or move to the entry level??? I think, if my memory doesn't betrays me, in one of your post, you've mentioned about moving to the entry level... I asked the question as 2 trades issue and this issue, both are part of money management...

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I will very pleased to show my charts, but i don´t know how to do it ... sorry...

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Good job Jeronimo !! i'm agree with that : " By the way i think that the SL should be put 100 pips from the theorical entry, not the real one (if it is not the same)..if the difference is too important, better not to enter "

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Yes, i enter with 2 trades. I will modify post n°1 with all the strategy rules, it will be more clear . And yes, I move the SL to the entry level if i'm 200 pips up .

--- 帖子 #419 ---
200 pips up !!

--- 帖子 #420 ---

Zebulon, Extraordinary results. Congratulations. I enter EUR short when he went by SL and I was scared and I did not get along. Now, When can I enter again in some of the 3 pairs? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I think, you have to get on the running train... that is enter the trade when price touches the 50 EMA with all the conditions/rules in favor..... Right zebulon?? Answered to see whether I understood properly...

It was a good trending week so a lot of pips to be made. I am sure there will be a little bit of a takeback coming up....Be careful if starting and short on capital...... I would wait and see a zigzag or two before starting the sytem. ...Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
If you understand the system but short on capital then you can start with demo account....waiting and watching is far different then doing...... waiting and watching is part of learning though..... I also waited long before starting.... during waiting, I thought I've learned enough but when I started doing....It's a very different thing..... It might be due to the fact that, I was a newbie... You can handle situation with your experience.... I'm just sharing mine....

--- 帖子 #427 ---
I am using IBFX with 5 digits. should i set the level to 1000? Thank you

--- 帖子 #428 ---
absolutely YES

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Zebulon, Below are a couple of scripts that I developed to open orders for this extraordinary strategy. I prefer open 4 orders at a time, each order with a TP at a distance of 100 pips over the previous. The last order I open it with twice the TP or without TP. This script help us to open these orders with the following parameters: StopLoss: Distance in points for each order. TakeProfit: Distance in points for each order with respect to previous. Lots: Lots for each order. RiskPercent: Applies to calculate the maximum exposure by all orders to open about equity. Only calculated if Lots = 0. Orders: Number of orders to open. TPLastOrder: If true, the last order opens with TP. DistanceLastOrder: TP multiplied by this parameter to the last order. Ie, If 2 and TP = 100 pips, the TP of the last order is 200 pips. MagicNumber: MagicNumber of each order. If interested, please try first these scripts on a demo account. Any comments will be gladly answered.

Hi Zebulon, Go long EU @ 1.3345 and move SL to 1.3245. Am I correctly following the rule? Pls confirm... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/editor/smilie.gif Thanks!...

Zebulon, do you think it'd be worth lowering the entry to say +75 for pairs like CAD with smaller daily ranges and volatility?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Yesterday, I got on the train. Opened, 4 orders in EURUSD at 1.3348 Order 1: SL: 1.3248 TP: 1.3448 Order 2: SL: 1.3248 TP: 1.3548 Order 3: SL: 1.3248 TP: 1.3648 TS: 200 pips Order 4: SL: 1.3248 TP: ------ TS: 200 pips Green Pips for all!!!

I got stopped out on EU/USD at 1.3241

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Zebulon, as GBP/USD, and EUR/JPY both are open at long position and likely to hold the direction.... EUR/USD is likely to get going on same direction again after little correction.... if everything goes right then when it'll be good time to enter long on EUR/USD? when price touches 50 EMA after retracing back or when it starts to retrace back???

--- 帖子 #453 ---
But the rules say that we should now be short on EUR/USD ? I'm currently short

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Yes you are right, except zebulon has a rule where if he is long/short already he will not take an opposing trade on correlated pairs...

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thanks, looks like I better do some more homework cheers

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I'm short Eur/Jpy @106.17 anyone else seeing any trades cheers

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi Zebulon, What are current trade opportunities according to "Dancing with EMA" strategy.... Prices of all three recommended pairs are below the 50 EMA line and each pair price crossed the 100 pips margin once if not more....

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi Zebulon, How are you? We miss your postings/comments in the current situation; should we wait a bit longer before jump in again? Touch the stone before crossing the stream... Cheers! ...

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Why wait? The rules are very clear and when the entry parameters are present in the market you enter. Simple as that. Don't wait or try to second guess a system as you have no way of knowing what will happen next. The only thing you can do is take every trade that qualifies according to the rules - as Mark Douglas would say - "without reservation or hesitation"...

--- 帖子 #460 ---
It has nothing to do with waiting or hesitation, just want to know whether the "3 x SMA5-EMA50 Crossings and 15 Candles" rule should be applied on EURUSD and GBPUSD at the moment. Since I am a newbie and need your help to confirm it. Thanks!...

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Now, EUR/JPY is on opposite side of EUR/USD and GBP/USD in relation to 50 EMA line. GBP/USD is on short position continuing phase, EUR/USD is moving towards 50 EMA after probable short opening position though second short entry is not probable yet as it's not 80 pips away from first entry.....rather if anyone missing the first entry can jump into the train..... EER/JPY is on continuing long position..... the picture mentioned above is considering each pair alone.... now as the new rule evolved in the above mentioned post.... suppose a person has no position opened in this picture.... how should he move on.... should he plan for going short on EUR/USD or wait for all pairs going on same side of 50 EMA?? I'm a learner.... learning stage... so an expert opinion could help me and all the newbie.....

On my chart on 9th March 2012, at 1200 hours (Trading platform timezone, GMT +2), price movement of GBP/USD, EUR/USD was strong downwards (105 pips and 97 pips body of the candle respectively) where it was 10 pips downwards for EUR/JPY.... now to say correlated pair, is price movement direction similarity sufficient? or the amount of price movement (in terms of pip) should be considered?? another thing is that-- at the above mentioned scenario EUR/USD was below the 50 EMA and short position was opened and EUR/JPY was above the 50 EMA and a long position was opened for that pair.... according to the rules described in the first post....and the price movement in all three cases helped to stay on the positions..... so should we avoid the correlation theory of pairs here or it's just a single incidence which should not affect the new rule.... On 27th Februrary 2012 at 800 hours (GMT +2), GBP/USD moved up 1 pips, EUR/USD moved down 61 pips and EUR/JPY pips moved down 109 pips.... On 29th Februrary 2012 at 1200 hours (GMT +2), GBP/USD moved up 29 pips, EUR/USD moved down 69 pips and EUR/JPY pips moved up 19 pips.... On 8th March 2012 at 800 hours (GMT +2), GBP/USD moved up 38 pips, EUR/USD moved up 63 pips and EUR/JPY pips moved up 99 pips.... During writing this post... GBP/USD is moving down 9 pips, EUR/USD is moving down 23 pips and EUR/USD is moving down 47 pips.... I know.... price movement won't correlate in every minutes and seconds.... but I'm not looking at point of time here....just pointed the important price movement period in recent past. Price movement of almost 100 pips can trigger any buy/sell opportunity or can hit s/l...... I think, direction might be similar most cases but the speed of movement is not the same always so.... prices of all pairs are not on the same side and thus, similar position might not be possible..... Expert's opinion pls....

Hi Zebulon, Are you in any kind of problem or on vacation?? Till now, probably this page is going to be the first page where you didn't post a message..... Hope that you're fine.... mazis

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Well... The "guru" (teacher) hasn't responded, we're on our own. Hope, he is doing well. Zebulon, many thanks for showing us a way of profitable trading. So long! Cheers...

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Yes, we're grateful to him for showing us such nice strategy.... trading the trend by dancing with MA....

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi all, I'm very new both to the trading and to this forum (in matter of fact this is my first post here). I found this strategy very simple and appealing but I'd like to clarify some issues with you: 1) I don't quite get when you can move SL to BE. After "earning" +200 pips? Is it dependend on how many positions you have? 2) What is the rationale of buying when price touch EMA 50? Eg. we are short on EUR/USD. Price goes steeply down, without retracement and never touches EMA 50. We're making some crazy pips on one position, but then we have to lose it when trend reverse? Because we don't have additional positions and our stoploss is not trailing one? 3) What is exact meaning of "entry on retracement". How do we know if it's a final retracement? If anyone could help me, it would be very appreciated, best.

Thank you very much Mindaugas, it is very helpful.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Hope he will return. They aren't many easy to master yet simple trading method like zebulon.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Early today in my chart EURUSD got 100 pips distance between EMA50 line and the last H4 candle close. I believe, it's time to jump in the new trend... Please let me know what you think. Cheers...

I have been following this thread for a while and absolutely love its simplicity. I have venture to make some improvements to the system for myself while not departing very much from the system, thus the reason why I choose to post here. I hope Zebulon does not have a problem with me messing with his rules for myself and posting here. I have attached a chart that has a modified 50ema that makes detecting subtle changes in the trend very visible and it help me to more carefully trade with the 50 ema. I have also choosen to use also an 13 ema instead of the Zebulon 5. I think this longer ema helps to stay much longer in our trades. Also on the chart is the 100 pip up and 100 pip down channel - I found the indicator somewhere on this thread. That channel makes seeing the criteria for entry and exit more visible.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hello Triberry ! Could you explain me what kind of changes did you made to the 50ema ? thank you in advance. ps. i love this thread too, very simple and very effective !

I've found another similar strategy..... by paulaelli (forum member from another site, so the link will take you to that site, not an affiliate link. Right click on the link and open in new tab to keep the current page open) Another strategy using EMA aidysproule (forum member from another site, so the link will take you to that site, not an affiliate link. Right click on the link and open in new tab to keep the current page open) As I'm not the owner of these strategies, I didn't start a new thread... that's why I shared it here for it's somewhat similarity.... If moderator/thread owner things that I shouldn't post it here... just PM me.... I'll delete it.... thanks mazis

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Thank you !

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi Zebulon, this is a nice thread!!! Please keep updating your trades!!! Greg.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi all, I'm following this thread now... anyone use this method, please update it.. many green pips for you all...

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I do like the trading system but zulon is seen no longer posting. Sad.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Guys, this is what I've found on Alpari UK. Is it a good sell signal?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Care to share the band like indy? The clock?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
very simple method. hopefully i can make some profit with it.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
The band on EMA50? it's just the levels on it. put +100 and -100 levels on EMA50.. And here I give you The CandleTime indicator.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
I cant believe this thread has ground to such a halt already... This is one of the best, simplest, most potent strategy on this site so far as I have seen. It can be mellowed to anyone's style.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
If you add this management, you should come out on top. First trade, set TP - 500 pips for four digit broker. Second trade tp - 400 pips and let the subsequent trade run. Note: set stop loss to -50 when trade is +150, and set stop loss to breakeven when trade is +200pips, hope this help some few traders, backtest and see for yourself.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hello, I really like your strategy because I am in love with MAs on higher time frames. What I suggest though, switch your chart from 4H to weekly and behold MEGAPIPS! I believe that MAs on a weekly is the holy grail everybody is searching for. I knew it existed! I never believed those conspiracy theorists who say that it didn't. Just put it on weekly and behold. Good luck to everybody.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
What do you think about it ??

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Zebulon, First, I'm glad you're back. Second, when there is definitely a strong trend, the strategy works great. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi, I sent a PM to Zebulon to ask his permission to publish some modifications I made ​​to your strategy to try to make the maximum not only in periods of trend, but avoid to the maximum, ranges. First of all congratulations to Zebulon for their strategy and I give credit to nanningbob from whom I learned a lot, especially in its strategy Nb 10.2 of which I have taken several things to match the strategy of Zebulon. I hope I can help in some way to all who have given me his teachings here in FF. Here are the modifications to the strategy: Indicators: EMA50 Shift 0 Close. (Levels +100 and -100) 10.2W 1MA MTF 5.12 10.2 WeeklyPivots S1.R1 5.9 10.2 WOH 1.0 5.4 10.2 WOH 2x1 5.4 10.2 TMA Slope v1.4B 4.30 for EA SELL: Entries: PA close below of EMA 50 – 100 (below of lower band of channel), and TMA Slope &lt; -0.4, and PA &lt; Weekly Pivot, and PA &lt; Weekly Open, and WOH 1.0 &lt; 0, and WOH 2x1 &lt; 0 SL = Upper Band of Channel. At close of each candle you should move the SL to the upper band of the channel. (*) When the PA touch again EMA50, If PA is at least 80 pips below the entry price of the previous order, and TMA Slope &lt; -0.4, and WOH 1.0 &lt; 0, and WOH 2x1 &lt; 0 Open new SELL. SL = Upper Band of Channel. At close of each candle you should move the SL to the upper band of the channel. Repeat (*) until close the orders for exit conditions. Exits: TMA Slope &gt; -0.4, or Stop Out BUY: Entries: PA close above of EMA 50 + 100 (above of upper band of channel), and TMA Slope &gt; 0.4, and PA &gt; Weekly Pivot, and PA &gt; Weekly Open, and WOH 1.0 &gt; 0, and WOH 2x1 &gt; 0 SL = Lower Band of Channel. At close of each candle you should move the SL to the lower band of the channel. (*) When the PA touch again EMA50, If PA is at least 80 pips above the entry price of the previous order, and TMA Slope &gt; -0.4, and WOH 1.0 &gt; 0, and WOH 2x1 &gt; 0 Open new BUY. SL = Lower Band of Channel. At close of each candle you should move the SL to the lower band of the channel. Repeat (*) until close the orders for exit conditions. Exits :TMA Slope &lt; 0.4, or Stop Out NOTE: In high volatility pairs is necessary to change the distance of each band of the channel at 200 and the distance for new orders to 160. (For example, XAUUSD). Pairs : In all, preferred the more volatile, eg GBPNZD, EURNZD, GBPAUD, GBPCAD, GBPJPY, GBPCHF, EURUSD, EURCAD, EURAUD, GBPUSD, EURJPY, AUDUSD.

Maudur, Thanks for share, very interesting, as always in all your posts !

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Sorry I am not a technical guy. I can't find the "property" where I can set +/-100. Anyone can help? (show it by image would be great for easy understanding) Thanks ---- p. s. I found it by setting +/- 1000 so that the bands are large as compare to +/- 100.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Good to see your post. Do you change your trading method like what maudur said? Or remain as original?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hi, In the moving average indicator select levels tag.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Make you own backtesting. And tell us all how you get on trend and in range.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hello Zebulon I noticed the thread has been silent, btw, do you still trade 5/55? Cheers

--- 帖子 #495 ---
What's the deal with this thread? I have integrated its principle in my trading and have made good progress. Who else has? No one?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Suggestion: You can resume this trading method. I think it is potential (don't know why Z stopped?).

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Does anyone have a good EMA indicators? I would be grateful for sending

--- 帖子 #498 ---
fxmaj Isn't that MA a built-in indicator in MT4? You can select the the type of MA - simple, exp, smooth or linear? Or?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Yes, this system is interresting when eur/jpy is trendind. But not during ranging periods. So it needs something else to avoid ranges. That 's why i'm working on another system. I will tell you about it when all will be ready ...

--- 帖子 #500 ---
I've traded a lot on this kind of MA type system... I think you are going to get fried when the market goes through a period of ranging.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
OK. Any chance you can share your trading system (in a new thread)? I am always keen. Cheers

--- 帖子 #77 ---
My current system I won't share.. To be honest I found the whole use of indicators in general disappointing.. Maybe I just didn't use them properly or something or find the correct combination... But for now I have concluded they are snake oil...

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Zebulon, It's good to hear from you. waiting to see the new system. Mazis.
