Introduction After many PM's, Emails, &amp; any other possible ways of contact by what seems like the entire FF family; I've decided to share my simple trading system/strategy with you. For those who don't know me, my name is Josef (pronounced: Joseph) and I have been trading fx for over two years. I frequent the Eur/Usd thread as I only trade Eur/Usd. I chose to trade E/U because of the viable; business nature of the pair. The Problem Different strokes for different folks. While we all hold various skills and tools, we all are tackling the same problem. Unfortunately, one person's method may not help another. Oscillator Indications. For the most part I have a huge problem with putting them to practice on a live account. The reasons are of course, obvious. Though, I would never tell a person their system and/or indicator doesn't work. It's just that, Oscillator Indicators has never worked for me. The Solution Price Action. As some of us cringe at those two, little words, I totallty understand. I too, was one that didn't believe in Pure Price Action trading. After putting Price Action up to test, I found I understood the market better. I understood the why, how, and when of Price Action. What I've found is that a trader only needs Candlestick Patterns, Trendlines, and maybe Pivot Points. * * * **** Revised **** Trendline Break System version 2.0 Visit POST #63 to view the revised strategy http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=63 Get a compiled version of Heikin Ashi Visit POST #65 to download http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...5&amp;postcount=65

Overview If there ever was an easier; modular system, this one is the one. The basic idea of trendlines comprises of many variables that must be taken in consideration when in use, such as, Trend Angle, Momentum, &amp; Time. I'll let you in on a little secret on trading: its not as "random" as most would want you to belive. The market tends to trend either way and patterns occur more often than you think. I would invite you to study up on Market Movements and Patterns, Candlestick Reveral Patterns, and Trendline Uses. The Trendline Break system contains three individual variation; all based on personal preferences. One will be discussed in this thread. The other two will be discussed in a later date. One of the major problems with trading trendlines is that most traders do not know how to properly set and use them. Here is some readings on how to properly apply trendlines. http://www.investopedia.com/articles...trendlines.asp http://stockcharts.com/education/Cha...rendlines.html http://www.incrediblecharts.com/tech...trendlines.php A very good skill to hold is being able to read Candlestick Reversal Patterns. Here are some readings on how to properly read and react to candlestick reversal patterns, http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...stick_bullish_ http://www.babypips.com/school/reversal_patterns.html http://www.incrediblecharts.com/tech...ndlesticks.php Tools of the Trade 1) Trendlines 2) Candlestick Reversals Patterns 3) Any Timeframe Trading Strategy. As Simple as One, Two &amp; Three 1) Find the upwards trend, 2) Apply the trendline, 3) Price Action breaks downwards through the trendline Our first step is to locate a strong upwards trend. Apply a trendline to help visually spot out that trend and to use as an "barrier" for Price Action. Now we wait for Price Action to breakthrough the trendline and head downwards, in which a SELL order may now be entered. The chart below is an example of a trade setup we are looking for. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Exit Rules Now that we have an live SELL order open and locked in some green pips, our next focus should be to plan for an exit. Based on our knowledge of Candlestick Reversal Patterns, we will not only use this for entries, but for exits as well. To exit an open position, the trader must recognize candlestick reversal patterns and exit that trade accordingly. Trade Notes * Though, this system uses SELL orders only, technically you could appy this strategy to BUY order as well. SELL orders were chosen because of their quick; predictable nature of movement. At best, it's always best to practice trading one direction as opposed to two. * Market volatility. This system may become useless under low volatile market conditions. Please take note of slow and/or erratic market movements as these conditions have the ability to produce incorrect trading signals. * Limit Losses. As with any trading system, a trader must use discretion in limiting ones trading risks and losses. Remember, the basic idea of this system is to keep it simple and focused by limiting equity exposure and offer a very focused trading strategy. This system includes an entry, exit, and simple price action tools; all that is needed for a trader to be profitable. Stay focused and always stick to the plan.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for the examples. Is this a sell only strategy?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Yes aelimian, This is a sell-only strategy. We wait for a clear upwards trend and sell on teh retracement. You could look at this a Retracement Trading. I made and call many trades using this system. It's simple, functional, &amp; focused ... lots of green pips earned trading this system.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Couldn't you technically use this on longs, too? Couldn't you wait for the stochs to go below 20, set up a downward trendline and take the break out up?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
You're kidding, mhh? This works in both directions.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
If sell works then buy should also work as you stated..my humble opinion from the logic..

--- 帖子 #10 ---
There's a common belief that sell-off happens faster and with more force than buying runs. Maybe he's trying to play off that belief the same way traders use fibs. Jhig?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Short trades run much faster than Long trades, hence less chance of the trade going the other direction while you are not looking. Hey, they have Gravity on their side. LoL A simple De mark indicator will show you the trend break, project the TP and redraw the trendlines.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Jhig, Thanks for the system. Do you use anything else to filter the trades?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Yes, the Trendline Break system could be used for both Long and Short trades. I personally choose Short trades because of the fast nature of trading shorts, compaired to long trades. The purpose of this system is to keep things short, simple, and sweet. Too many traders try and attempt to trade any and all movement in the market, hence over exposing their equity. Swing trading is NOT for everyone, but a focused system is. The basis of this system is to 1) pick a direction 2) find a clearly defined entry 3) collect the profits, all the while limiting ones exposure. Remember, keep it simple. Trading is not complicated.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
jhig will it work with a demakrk undicator that are mentioned by someone ? trendlines are otherwise verry personal 10 persons can draw 10 different trendlines on the same chart ? best regards

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Jhig, Do you wait for the candle to close below the trend line or do you wait for the PA to cross the trend line and if it is PA crossing the trend line then by how many pips. How many pips is your SL and does this change on different time frames. What is your favourite time frame...or most profitable. Many thanks, Billser

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Entry: Wait for Candlestick Reversal Patterns give us a reversal signal. Once a price action reversal has taken place, wait for price action to break the trendline downwards. Enter at the close of the candle that broke through the trendline. My favorite timeframe is the 5min chart but this is a strategy that could be used on ALL timeframes. Apply this strategy to any timeframe you are comfortable with.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I'm not sure about using the De Mark indicator as I 've never used it, or heard of it.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I just love them trendlines Keep drawing and never stop

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thanks Belekas, I too love Trend Lines. Trend Lines are an important tool in technical analysis for both trend identification and confirmation. Using a Trend Line Break system, I can personally guarantee any trader can and will make money on a daily basis. Trend Lines work for any market; Stocks, Futures, Fx, etc. Take a look at this Amazon.com chart Attached Image http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...is:trend_lines Vist to learn more about Trend Lines This chart show a perfect example of using Trend Line Break in the stock market. Price trends downwards then break through the trendline upwards for a 10 point profit.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
My trading is based on patterns and ranges so TL's play important role. Once you learn to identify i technically significant line, profit is just around the corner.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Fantastic question--- this should tell why demarker indicator users are not so satisfied---cause sometimes trendlines are not broken but respected--and you sometimes end up looking at the price travel between the supply and demand line all day---

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Sorry, I'm un-aware of the De Mark Indicator. Trendline Break system is a "modular" setup to where you could use Ocsillators Indicators as well as Pricing Action Indicators to increase trading profitability. For instance, you could use an Stochastics to guage market reversals and time exits strategies. In addition you could also use MACD in the same manner as well as Parabolic Sars to say, confirm directions and trend reversals. A personal favorite of mine is to use Fibs w/ trendlines to gauge the depth of the reverals and to anticipate wha fib level price will bounce off. Pivot Points could be used as well in the same degree but with slightly different rules of engagements. I would invite traders to get a solid grasp of the basics in using trendlines before adding additional indicators.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi, thanks for sharing. On the pictures you posted can you please tell us what candle patterns you entered on? I am seeing a lot of reversal candles that occured, then price went through your trendline and reversed and continued in the same direction. So is there a reason you were not triggered into the trades? Do you, for example, only enter on the close of the candle to avoid the false breaks? Thanks

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Trade is executed at the close of the candle break through candle. As with all trading systems, there will be false signals. The key to avoiding these false signals is knowing how to place correct trendlines &amp; not rushing into a position. You could also us Stochastics 8,3,3 to guage over-bought areas. As with any market the trader must use discretion when entering into a postion. Risk management should always be on a trader's mind

--- 帖子 #25 ---
People, seriously! This trading method is one of the easiest trading method ever implemented and it seems everyone is making this more complicated than it has to be. Everyone is looking for this guaranteed profit-making system and I'm sorry, there isn't such a strategy; trading system. The market is based on a huge phletora of unknowns and what makes of a good trader is the ability to manage Risk and choose to trade in the right direction of the market at lease 60+ percent of the time; that's where this system comes into play. As I said in another thread, the maket is full of unknowns and everything is NOT in your favor. We retail traders sit in a plastic life boat riddled with holes in the thick of the sea, millions miles away from shore in the mist of night; darkness surrounding. Man eating sharks all around. Wading out the most horrific storm. We hold no control over what go on around us. The only thing that is for certain is the entire world is betting against us; anticipating our demise. The only thing we traders have on our side and have complete control over is Risk . If traders would start focusing on handling the situation of what we do have control over and not dealing with the problems of what we don't have control over ... you'd see a lot more profitable traders. The trader with the most indicators and physics based, complicated system; is a trader that is answering a question to a problem no one knows of or haven't a clue about. These are the traders that are afraid and haven't grasp any info or knowledge on how the market works. These are the 95 percentiles that statistically, we hear so much about.

Keep up the good work Jhig

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I dont know if You guys seen this but here is some good site with patterns. http://www.thepatternsite.com/CandleVisual.html

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Jhig: Thanks for your good work. It's the best if we can keep it simple. Can you please post some live trade example with chart (it could be on demo also), so that we can follow better? Thanks, -FX_California

--- 帖子 #29 ---
You have mentioned pivot points a few times - I am going to assume that you look for reversal patterns around a pivot point and use the same sell setup? Thx in advance.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Do you draw the trendline looking at longer term chart and then execute trades based on the 5m chart as you mentioned? I would think that trendlines on 5m chart are not as significant, prone to false breakouts. Do you take into account news and keep or stop trading around significant news times? What is your typical stop loss and profit target?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
For those who follow the Trendline Break System, should have had a very profitable day. A 130+ pip; profitable day.

good examples maciek2 you said about use SL and TP what SL and TP would you use?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks Heral and look: TP and SL depends from Timeframe and Pair. I'm not an TP/SL expert, so I leave this issue for other users.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
It seems on 5m chart if you consistently used 10pip s/l and 20pip target each trade, you could have an overall pretty consistently successful system.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hey Maciek, thanks for posting those examples. Your charts look good; great point on using Stop Losses because it's not a perfect system by any means, but a profitable one. I believe a trader will profit way more then he/she loses. Good Job !!!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Darkness, that is pretty much the exact system I use. I aim for 20 pips a trade with 10 pip Stop Loss. I never "ride out" the market, attempling to collect all that I can. It's a very focused trading system that have allowed me to enjoy many green pips. I invite all traders to at least give it a try and see where this system takes your equity.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks for support Jhig. And darkness have a truth. H4 domain is a big SL level, if you have a small SL, you must look on M5. Trade on H4, but look for ideal open on M5 - best tactics, I guess.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi all, So far all the examples shown are good ones. Any consideration on how to handle those false trendline breaks? I have lost several times due to false breaks! Am not so good in candlesticks. Any highlight on this is appreciated.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Jhig, This is my first post here on FF, but just had to comment on your system. I do like your chart setup. I use a somewhat similar chart set up to yours although different parameters/indicators and it is refreshing to see non-metatrader charts on FF. However, there is inconsistency in your method. You mention that in your chart there is a 130+pip profit. Yet, in a later post you mention you go for 20 pip profit with 10 pip stop loss, so there's no way you would have achieved that 130 pip profit. Also, 20 pip profit and 10 pip stop loss seems arbitrary. Do you really stick to that on every trade? From my experiene trend line breaks can give powerful moves. I would agree with you that break below the trendline normally proceeds quicker than breaks above, with the EUR/USD. I am always impressed with the time people like yourself can take to reveal what works for them.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Sure it can work, with proper trade management you can make some great pips with these shorts. I'm not sure of other software and brokers but my broker allows me to liquidate part of my positions in metatrader 4. If you properly backtest this system, I did on 5M chart, you'll see there are quite a few trendline breaks (i did not pay attention to candlestick formations) - just trendline breaks for short opportunities, you'll see that and ,depending which pair but Euro is best for this due to low spread AudUsd works too, frequently it will drop 15-20 pips or more. With 10pip s/l, as soon as you in positive, move the s/l and keep moving it to zero,that way you not risking anything its a free trade. You'd want to start with 2 lots for each trade, liquidate half of your position at TP of 15 or 20 pips, set the 2nd half at zero stop loss and let it run. Sometimes they'll run for quite a bit (40+ pips). And sometimes more and sometimes not. if you trade more volatile pair like EurJpy which my broker gives very low spread on but this thing can frequently run 30-40+ pips down. 2 trades like that a day can consistently give you fairly safe 60 pips, risking 10pips on each - 1:3 RRR. I backtested it on EurJpy for past few days, it can be done. Oscillator crossover comes in slightly handy in these as well i think. Check out chart. Nice 80 pip short on the eur/jpy on the break.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Yea same problem with me too, please let me know if you get an answer for this! I changed my trading style coz of this problem. I did post the same question the other day but seems to have disappeared... cheers

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Chart examples would help. I've gotten couple false trendline breaks too and thats fine,i'm only risking 10 pips, i'm actually going to start only risking 5 pips because once these things go they typically go down if its true break, otherwise you only risking 5 , then wait for next break. On backtesting i've done, it seems about 7 out 10 breaks are good for 10+ pips. Oscillator crossover helps a little too.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Now, that's the way to make a simple set up work for you. Incidentally, there's another thread here on FF about trendline break with moving average. Highly recommended.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Thanks. Thats funny i was just thinking of adding 2 moving averages to the charts, havent seen the thread yet but noticed there is a couple of trendline break threads. Thx!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi All: I do use trendlines, channels for trading and found this thread recently. Just spotted a potential setup for short on GBP/USD. I'm attaching a screen shot. I waiting for a break of the channel lower line, pull back for entry.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
In addition to a scalping system that I use, I also like trend line breaks in the direction of the longer term trend. Essentially I am taking advantage of getting back in on the trend after a retracement is over. I do trade like somebody earlier had suggested with 2:1 TP:SL ratio. To me that takes out any discretion on exiting. I trade on the 1 minute. What can I say, I like to be in and out a lot! Here is a late Friday UJ set up that never came to fruition before the market closed. It shows 3 touches off the line and long term trade direction is long. This would most likely be a 10 pip SL and 20 pip TP if I were able to pull the trigger on it.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Haha, yeah. Gotta agree with some people here. Jhig, your charts pretty much only contain valid trendlines. But there were many more possible trendlines which you did not include in your chart. So simply drawing trendlines is going to fail. You will have to know which trendlines are valid. And I don't think you explained this. So it's just another method than works....if you know how to do it. @darkness: The last trendline you've drawn....is it a joke ?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
This trendline indicator may take some of the work out of it.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Trendline trading is not 100%. So, you have to be a little imaginative. Here's food for thought: After false break, take the loss. This now puts you in a very nice position. Why? Because you can let your bet size and money management work for you. The shaded region of the graph shows 2 examples of false breaks and how to handle it. No extra analysis involved, no looking to different indicators, no blame on the market for taking out your stop loss, no blaming yourself for taking the trade, just let bet size keep you trading. How many times have you seen 2 false breaks in a row, then 3 false breaks, get the idea!!!! Note: I'm not looking to redraw the trendlines when the false break occurs. You could of course do that. Another solution: place SL at 1 bar high; if it moves 5 pips above trendline, cover and reverse position with TP at previous bar high. . Don't overdevelop the art, develop the attitude.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Here is the graph.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
great, simple, i think this is what jhig did. i try this strategy too. and it's profitable.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Someone should try one of those currency strength meter things and only trade the break in the way of the strength. Just get the free one floating around and see if that makes a difference. If nothing else it may help you decide to hold the trade longer.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hello mr. Jhig. thanks very much for contributing your trendline break system.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
"You're Welcome" ... to all that are enjoying the simplicity of the Trendline Break System. I'm working on making this system even easier and will post the "revised" version really soon(maybe today, no promises). So stay patient and happy pip'in.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
*** Revised *** Trendline Break System version 2.0 Overview The revised Trendline Break System will utilize the Heikin Ashi Candlesticks; as opposed to the traditional Japanese Candlesticks. The Heikin Ashi Candlestick could be seen as an "improvement" upon the traditional candlestick by helping traders locate the trend better, amid often erratic market volatility. In addition, the Heikin Ashi allows a trader to "see" obvious trend reversal as it happens. Heikin Ashi helps a trader accomplishes all of this with only one glance. Tools of the Trade 1) Trendlines 2) Heikin Ashi Candlesticks 3) Any Timeframe The System ***The general dynamics of this system stays the same. *** 1) Find the upwards trend, 2) Apply the trendline, 3) Price Action breaks downwards through the trendline Our first step is to locate a strong upwards trend. Apply a trendline to help visually spot out that trend and to use as an "barrier" for Price Action. Now we wait for Price Action to breakthrough the trendline and head downwards, in which a SELL order may now be entered. The chart below is an example of a trade setup we are looking for. With the addition of the Heikin Ashi, traders will be able to apply the a trendline appropriately and anticipate market reversals; using the reversals as an exit strategy. For trader's, who are unfamiliar with Heikin Ashi, Investopedia offers a good read on the subject: http://www.investopedia.com/articles.../04/092204.asp Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trading Platforms Heikin Ashi is available on GFT DealBook360 and eSignal . I'm sure there are many other platforms Heikin Ashi resides on, but unfortunately I don't know of any off-hand. Check with your Platform's developer if Heikin Ashi is not available. Metatrader users , there is an Heikin Ashi indicator available for free. I was unable to find a Compiled version of download, so I will give instructions on installing Heikin Ashi (assuming it's not installed already). 1) Visit http://www.forexmt4.com/_MT4_Experts/Heiken299.mq4 - COPY and paste the MQ4. 2) Open MetaEditor. Select: FILE &gt; NEW 3) Wizard Popup. CUSTOM INDICATOR &gt; NEXT 4) Name it Heikin Ashi or anything you want. Select FINISH 5) Delete the pre-populated code. PASTE your Heikin Ashi code 6) Press COMPILE &gt; TERMINAL 7) Go back to the MT platform.

Your MT chart should look like this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Happy Pip'in

As a favor, could someone compile and post the Heikin Ashi Indicator, because my MT skill are lacking. I and MT users would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Sure thing.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Good Times! Thank you Sun, for posting a complied Heikin Ashi.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Anybody using pending orders instead the market once to reduce the number of false breakouts? Let's say if the candle closes below the trend line then put the SELL STOP N pips below the Low of that candle. Does that make sense? I hope this is not one of those "improvements" we've seen in other threads.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
So far I've had pretty good success using the trendline breaks in both direction on the 5 minute chart and validating the entry with a 5 ema cross of the 8 sma. Seems to work very well and looks like a decent filter.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hey Orest, I use Market orders, only because I trade the 5 Min chart and due to the speed and nature of that chart, I found it very difficult to "judge" an entry point using Stop Entries. The entries I place are never at the moment of a cross. Instead, I wait a bit, letting my eyes see an established break though the trendline before entering. Now, I've found it a lot easier to judge an Stop Entry Order on a larger timeframe, such as 4 Hour, Daily, etc... We, here in this thread, are open for suggestions on placing Pending Entries, if anyone want to share their own idea about the subject matter.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hey Marco, Congrads on your profitable successes. Thats what I like to hear; trader having success. Keep up the good work.

Is it true that a trend line needs to be tested at least 3 times by price and support the PA before it can really be considered a trend line?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
The "ideal" trade, you would want to look for Price to test the trendline at least three time, but you can apply a Break system with just an upwards (or downwards) trend without 3 price bounce.

Excellent Thread! i like this thread a couple of questions/comments 1. why not trade in direction of trendline AND the trendline break? for example after two tests, make buys on the trendline with small sl. 2. what about the retest of trendline on trendline break? check out this thread by a member of here and forex-tsd which may help to advance this thread to another level. http://www.forex-tsd.com/manual-trad...ut-retest.html 3. How could this method be improved with multiple fibs and fib times like what i found here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=162886 4. One thing I have noticed in trendline breaks is that the beginning of trend a-b-c where a is beginning b is last test and c is break, the price will fall at least equal of b-c after trend is broken. this could be looked for as first tp #of pips minus 10% so for a 130 pip last touch first profit could be 117. for those interested i recommend checking out marketgeometry online my tim morge also in lines. i only used trendlines, sr, and fibs to trade. if you combine this method with nobrainertrades and bobokus fibonacci trading and perhaps skunny indicator free i think you would have the holy grail in my opinion, because lines are the fortune teller. if you use them you will make a fortune, if you don't you will lose a fortune (on lost opportunities) because you don't know why price is doing what it is doing.

A very good thread Also I use the break of trendline for signals, but I use the closes to draw the TLs. And I use also the CCI 34 with EMA a 13. For orrizontal support &amp; resistance I use the retracements of the yesterday's daycandle ( the indicator StudFibo found on this forum ).

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Atlast, Thank you for appreciating the concept of "simple, but profitable". Good Job spotting those moves.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Stark, I like how you switched up the candles for a line chart. Very creative, yet interesting. You have to share you "Line Trendline" strategy as most of use do not know how to trade with a line chart, myslef included. Good Job. Happy Pip'in

--- 帖子 #85 ---
You are no longer trading trendline breaks. You are no longer trading price action. HA is only a simple indicator and hides the real price action. If you want the HA direction and turns, all you need is a weighted 5 simple moving average and it will change direction exactly the same time HA does. This new technique is unproven, If what you were doing was working why on earth would you swap it for this?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Was thinking the same thing. "HA is only a simple indicator" could be exactly why it may work better (operative word "simple"). Until proven though I'm sticking with the classic candlestick trendline breaks.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Any one else looking at this Euro/Jpy short?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Mac, Thanks for link to J16 for a very good reminder. Keeping things simple is easier on the eyes. Implementing a trendline method with what is basic to what the big players look at can only enhance a positive out come. No gaurantees, right, just a positive chance. Tight SL appropiate for the TF traded and let your winners have a chance to run. Good thread Jhig. I, also, like the 5m TF as well. Cliff

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hey plasma, Good looking chart! Price looks to be due for a retracement of some sort on that hourly chart. Thanks for the heads up! Happy Pip'in

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thanks for the complement Cliff! The key to a profitable style of trading, in my opinion, is keeping it simple. It seems a few of us on this thread are looking for the complicated and that is not what the trendline break system is about. Simplicity is key. Clean, clear, and organized will take a trader from broke to profitable. I see all to many threads asking, How to trade like the big boys? The trendline break system is one that most Institutional Traders implement with success, consistently. It's not rocket science and there isn't a long, overly extensive manual for this system. What this system offers is simplicity and profitability.

Hi Jhig , I just wanted to thank you for sharing your trading methodology . I agree completely that simplicity works . I have a book by Gerald Appel who is the inventor of MACD . He has a chapter about trendline breaks and states " If you can draw a straight line, you can make money ". The book was written in 1973 . Trendline break systems/methods have been around a long time which tells us they worked then and will continue to work now as you have shown us with your charts . The reason they continue to work is they are based on price action and not indicators . Best of Trades , EZTrades

Hi Wil I am currently watching a few pairs on the 1h TF. Have a look at the GU, AJ and AU, draw some lines on the current trend and wait http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif I am not trading this system at the moment, however I believe that using support resistance is probably the easiest and most profitable to trade for a newbie....and probably also for an oldie. I, however wouldn't be game enough to trade this way on lower TF, only because I am terrible with short TF. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Jhig, Simple is fine. Only thing I don't like about regular trendlines is they're not precise or warranted. Draw a trendline attached at top or base of candles tied into a significant event (news, a really big or tiny move, etc.), and you no longer have to deal with their freehand nature.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I too use this system . I have tried so many other systems, filled with indicators. I actually came up on this system on my own about 3 months ago. I started to draw lines on my chart and tried to analysis how PA bounced and broke through these lines. In the end, i had a successful system. I demoed it for about a month, made $. I then went live about 40 days ago and I'm making $ everyday. I am now a fulltime trader using Only trendlines, Fibonnacci, risk management, tight SL, lock in BE or small profit, and take profit with 1/2 of lot size once I am in profit. All these steps are necessary to win consistently The reason why this thread is DEAD, is there is nothing more we need to Discuss, the creator of this thread, was Very precise and 100% correct . Just follow the rules and stop second guessing youself. If you take a small loss, so what, this system is 70%+ successful for me . I will post some chart setups, because I love this system. Enjoy. Happy trading! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Trendline breakouts: here are a few lessons that I screen shot, while trading. The more screen time experience you have, the better judgment you will have when knowing when to enter these trendline breaks. You can enter LONG or short on these Trendline breaks You can use any time frame, with an appropriate SL of course There are Breakline FAKES . once way to avoid this, is to Draw trend lines from a daily, then 4hr, and trade with the trend. Good luck Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A false break is simply a trade in the original direction. http://img2.pict.com/42/59/6b/182450...kscontinue.jpg A break is much safer to trade once the extreme of the trend has been tested/exceeded then failed. http://img2.pict.com/44/8e/12/182452...tofextreme.jpg

Hi guys, Many times on a five min chart you can draw a trend line, when PA gets to the line it will bounce or go through it, I was thinking If when price touched the trend line and bounced 5 pips I would buy or if price broke the trend line by five pips id sell... My question is do you think 5 min chart would be best for this, and is five pips enough to confirm a bounce or break off the line, also SL was thinking ten pips.. any help much appreciated Rebel..

--- 帖子 #109 ---
great simple strategy, been testing today, 5 min charts great for scalping but need to be quick, lot of noise on 5 min charts, need to be fairly accurate with trendlines, 15 min charts may just be better

The trendline once broke, also acts as good support, worth noting, done it on several pairs today, this seems to be a very good strategy,

So do you get in as soon as the trend line is broken or do you wait for the candle to close below or above the trend line?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
If you draw a downward trendline but the price won't close above it, do you keep extending the line to more closely fit PA? Or is that trendline considered invalid and you wait to draw a new one?

Hi All, Great thread . Thanks everyone for the contribution . I don't know much abt Bollinger Band, but after seeing some thread I believe using BB with help analyze extreme points . Thanks, Raju

--- 帖子 #120 ---
It seems like people always chose to reinvent the wheel. There are numerous threads about this around here discussing it in a lot of detail. Regardless, Jhig thanks for the contribution and explaining your system and everyone for joining in. Food for thought about just going short: You aren't trading equities or commodities, or similar instruments. When you enter a position in EUR/USD you're going long/short, in this case only short/long. The theory of a more rapid price movement on average might apply to equities, don't know about this so much because this is just relative value between the two so it should move more or less equally in both directions. There may be some bias because of the long term trends we have seen in EURUSD however. Again, something to think about : Try looking at horizontal Support/Resistance lines. Trend lines are in essence diagonal S/R lines. Confluence of these S/R lines over different time frames and ranges can help you a lot. If you also look at horizontal ones, you will see where these lines cross and those points are usually very important, especially on higher TFs. This can help you filter out some bad trades, help you wait for the stronger area of S/R, or know when a trade is more likely to be profitable. Analysis over different timeframes can help you determine trends better and lets you double check if you are taking the trade in the right direction. Usually, S/R &amp; trendlines from higher timeframes are more important than the lower ones. I know this seems simple and I bet most of you heard this before, but don't underestimate this, I know I did when I started. One more thing before I end that's a little more menial, if you are trading 1HR time frames or smaller ones and are looking for trend reversals or strong retracements, think about when there is enough volume in the market to cause those big retracements. Usually there won't be real trend line breaks when there is very low volume (ex. between different exchange close/open gaps US evening). You are more sure to get strong movements when there's a lot of trading (London open is usually great for this and before and after NY opens but that session can get tricky) These are just some thoughts off the top of my head. I've been trading profitably for quite some time and and this is just from learning by experience and the good guys here at FF that I picked up a thing or two from. Hope it helps at least a little.

Bollinger Bands follow price with a moving average and the actual bands are calculated using standard deviations. The STDEV is 2 by default but depending on what you use them for can vary. They are very good in ranging markets, but we careful in starting trends because instead of price retracting, it will can continue for a long time. Bollinger Bands are also heavily used in determining breakouts from what I recall.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi jonaslt, Thanks for the input regarding BB usage in ranging market.This would help me a lot. Just had one more query , in ranging market there are many whipsaw . How to manage them ? I may not the right question in Trendline Break thread.I am sorry for that Thanks, Raju

--- 帖子 #123 ---
No problem. The idea of a ranging and trending markets is very interesting, let's look further into it. You have to be able to define what you mean by "market", is it the specific pair you are trading in a specific time frame, or are you talking long term trends of these pairs as most common people refer to? The way I see it, a ranging market in one time frame, is often a trending market in a much lower time frame. This is why multiple time frame analysis is so important, so you don't get caught taking a trade in what you think is a trending market when it actually isn't. As far as how to manage whipsaws in a ranging market, I think this is still relevant to this threat because those whipsaws are trend line breaks on a lower TF. I think it is best to think of Support/Resistance and trendlines as zones, not necessarily just a line. There are often zones that the price touches and plays around in before either bouncing back or through the zone and then continuing. These zones vary based on timeframes and may be 5-10, 10-20, etc. pip wide. There was a really good thread on this around somewhere about half a year or a year ago. Just because a price passes the trendline by 2 pips, did it really break it? What if there are other trendlines that are strong that are a few pips away that the price didn't reach yet? S/R zones are much more important than the lines you draw and tend to act as magnets. It is even easier if you think about that, and see how you can use candle stick patterns so see what is going on with price. There are continuation patterns, and reversal patterns that appear at these zones (either one one side or another) that often tell you what will happen with the price. I think someone mentioned candle sticks before also. Trading like this is looking purely at price action and is one of the purest ways to trade as believed around FF and there are many great threads on this with plenty of examples and discussion. Hope that helps at least a little... Jonas

how do u set u r TP?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I just draw them as they form. I look for 10 plus pips unless I'm forced out by a sl or tl cross with close. My sl is 5 pips plus spread, usually around 7.5 tot. As gain comes in I move my stop up accordingly. On a good trending day I'll sell half my trade and hope for the best with the rest. On a day like today's chart it was kinda crazy, got out with some minus and plus 10 pips. Once I hit my daily max I'm out. I have the Williams indicator but rarely use it. As long as there's 25 plus pips to work with I'll trade sideways. Otherwise channel it, look for pullback and go long or short. Nice thread.

Hi Josef, Hi all and thanks for the great thread. I really believe this is one of the methods employed by the likes of Soros, the other one being even simpler: MA crosses. This method can be applied to all markets / time frames. I am posting a trade that got triggered this afternoon (CET) on us crude oil. Working time frame daily and 4h. Got in at 75.55. I have just set a sl at BE + 10 pips, since it went very fast very. Note the divergence on the RSI which gave me confirmation of the trend change. I agree with Josef that one should only go one direction at a time, but my direction is given by the longer term trend of the object at hand. Please go ahead with the great job! Muntu

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Dear All, It's been interesting method. From the sample that some of you attached, it's look very simple but my question, from where to where we should pull the trendline because if you mistake choose the point, you may have wrong trendline. Maybe Mr Jihg can explain more. tq

--- 帖子 #153 ---
should we look for a trend of at least x amount of pips?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I personal just draw my trend like most chart that been posted and wait for price action to cross it and for extra confirmation I wait until candle close to make entry, this technique works on all time frams I been using it since I started forex about 1 1/2 yr i really don't use anything else it as simple support and resistant breakouts. Good luck to all. Jerome

--- 帖子 #155 ---
please explain

--- 帖子 #156 ---
If you have an established trend on a high timeframe - say Daily or weekly, and switch down to a lower TF - say hourly, would it be best to have a bias toward the long term trend? Would market moving news be in line with the longer established trend? Haven't had a close look at this. I've been using EMA(22) to establish a trendline, and seems to work well for direction as well as providing areas of support and resistance.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hello I just want to post a trade I took today, not sure everyone will agree that it's a trend line break but the break was what I based the trade on. Price tested a S/R level from Thursday and this was around the fib .50. The daily pivot was above... just as it happens today the pivot fell on a whole number so it could be said it would be a extra hard level to break. After price retested the S/R level and when a candle closed above the pivot/whole number I entered. It's nice when things work out.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Here is my trade of the day. Entry was on the candle with orange circle around it, good trendline break and closing above the daily pivot. As it worked out I guess you could have entered off the B.S.TL.B., hammer and support off the daily pivot .... But hey I have no crystal ball and am happy to get the pips the way I did!

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hey guys, it's been a long time since I posted anything on this thread. I haven't gone anywhere, been monitoring the thread in the background. Just want to chime in on a few things: 1) Direction: When you've established a trendline, remember to only trade in the direction of the trendline. Though the system is called "Trendline Break", you can also make some good money trading with the trend line as well as trading a valid break of the trendline. 2) Bounce: In addition to trading in the direction of the trendline, remember if price doesn't break the trendline and instead bounces off the trendline ... that would be a great opportunity to continue a a trend in the original direction of the trendline (trendline bounce) Example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This chart is a trade I took this past week and by following the direction of the trendline and playing orders off the trendline bounce(trend re-entry or reloading my long postions), I took in well over 1500 pips home this week from this currency pair alone. The idea of trading with the trendline is to establish an idea of the trend. Remember the main purpose of trendlines are to identify trends in the market. So if you use the Trendline break and trendline bounce, you should be able to identify some great price action moves.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
You don't have a large enough sample size to know if this works enough to justify adding an new variable to a very simple system of trading. You can't avoid losses it's part of trading. The higher the time frame you get a trendline break, the larger the move you can expect from it. Focus on getting a few large wins and they will pay for all the small losses from false breaks outs.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I like to trade the trendline breaks because you have a trigger for entry. If there is confluence at trendline with a support or resistance level then I like to trade with the trend. If there is not confluence, then I try to take a trigger from a candle pattern on lower the timeframe after price hits the trendline of the higher time frame.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I've been practicing this system about a month. Yes this system is working for me. And what I like the most about this system is the nature of LOW SL in this trading system. On M5 chart, we can put as low as 5 pips + spread SL. Yes I agree with JHIG, no system is a perfect green pips maker. Respect your SL . From what I learned so far, pulling back the SL in most of my case is just make the trade go even worst. If the trade hits the SL then it's not a valid breakout. Just accept it and move on to the next trade. I add another rule to myself in this startegy. The rule is: "If the SL got hits too often (maybe 3 times in a row in one trading session) there must be something wrong with the way I draw the trendline or maybe something is going on in the market that I dont know about. It's time to bail out and come back another day." Thanks Jhig!

Hi, In a recent post (on another thread) you suggested that most professionals will operate on the 1H time-frame, but earlier on this thread you seemed to be using the 5 minute. Which time-frame do you most use for this technique, or would you recommend? Kind regards,

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I depends on how far along you are in your trading. I've always advocated if you're inexperienced in the market, always trade Daily or higher. Any timeframe lower than 4 hours should only be used by pro traders. When I started this thread, my intentions where to train my method of trading to aggressive pro traders but I found out quickly, new or inexperienced traders took note of the strategy instead. Since starting this thread, I myself took to allowing myself LESS screen time so I pulled away from the extreme intraday timeframes and moved up to medium/longterm trading frames, allowing myself to live a nice quality of life. I employ two different timeframes of longterm and intraday. My long term strategy looks to hold positions with stable pairs (pairs like EurUsd GbpUsd) for weeks/months at a time, depending on how far the trend goes. My intraday trading is usually focused on strong moving/super volatile pairs (such as EurNzd EurAud GbpNzd GbpAud etc) and only traded on 1 hour or 4 hour timeframes. I can't recommend as that would be based on the trader's skill level. All I can tell you is to look long term if you're serious about making money. The thing I said about pro traders is correct. Protraders don't touch anything under an hour. Pro traders trading the hourly is considered ultra-aggressive. The average pro trades the daily or higher. The typical aggressive pro trades 4 hour to daily - yes thats considered aggressive with their favorite being 6H, 8H, and 12H

Hi, Jhig! I discovered this thread few weeks back. Thanks for sharing. I am concerned about your post here about higher TF. This is correct and logical, but what would you say about the whopping SL on higher TF. I'm sure not everyone can swallow that. The edge of the TL break system IMHO is that, if carefully followed with good MM, it can help you grow your account. Then you are welcome to move to higher TF. Thx.

Hello fellow traders! Although I don't post much, I have been reading a lot of threads, and the latest one was right this, the Trendline Break thread, and I believe it is a pity that so few people have posted in these last 2-3 months. Yet this is one of the most powerful method of trading that you can use. Myself, I learned to trade solely with trendlines, pivot points, candlesticks and, sometimes, one indicator (trendlines as my main tool) since a few months, and this has totally changed my way of trading. Since i have thrown away all the indicators, and concentrating on PA only, I have been able to reach a level of confidence that I have never thought I could ever had, averaging constantly 300-400 pips monthly only in EUR/USD. I will tell you more about it, if any of you is interested, but since a picture is worth than a bunch of words, here's a fresh example: In the chart below, we can see that in the last 24 hrs before the weekend, we have 2 gold opportunities in EUR/USD 1hr chart. Trendline 1 was broken by a strong bullish candle. In central Europe, it was night at the break time, so I entered the trade when it was already halfway (I don't recommend doing this) , making anyway a nice profit. I drew another trendline (2) and entered the second trade at the close of the first bearish candle (trendline 2 breakout) collecting 35 pips this time. More than 50 pips overall on a friday without any big risk, not bad at all, isn't it? Not every day is like that of course, but I can assure you that you get a wonderful feeling when you know that most of the times you will end your day with nice gains in your pockets. If you have any question or want to share more thoughts and ideas, go ahead! I can also post more charts in my real trading time starting next week if you are interested. Let's keep this thread alive and let's all benefit from this great way of trading! Best luck and happy weekend everyone sedge

Sedge that was a beautiful one, just look out how simple ur screen look, void of clusters of indicators. I wonder y bother with these indicators in d first place . Two clean and very clear signals. Sedge whts ur favorite time frame? I m used to 5mins

Nice clean chart, easy follow. Trend lines baby! This is almost exactly how I started trading 3 months ago and it's easy and hassle free and the gains are more than the losses. I'd like to see your trades posted as I'm trying to perfect my method. I don't use pivot points but I do look at fibs sometimes, mostly for targets from breakouts. I use horizontal breakout after congestion and I use breakouts of sloped trend lines. For the past few months I've been using lots of 0.1 and no more. I track my trades on MTi so once I see consistency I might increase lot size to 2% risk of the account value. 0.1 lots is lower than 1% at this time. MTi will also help me figure out what pairs to stay away from as well as some other metrics. I don't wait for a close of a breakout bar but I have noticed that tight stops work well. If its going to break its going to do it fast. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
@ Pip-Stud: as for my trading style, I rarely stick my nose out of the trio 15m - 30m - 1h. I try to avoid being whipsawed too much or risk to have large drawdowns. When I feel like getting into scalping mode, I check the 15m chart, but I look first to the 30m and 1h charts for opportunities. Tipster: I guess our trading styles are quite similar. I look too for horizontal breakouts after long congestion periods, and I use the same your mini lots and risk percentage as well. Nevertheless, I prefer to wait for the close of the breakout bar, although I don't follow that rule blindly. The two signals I've shown you in my previous post were indeed very clear and neat. The first one looked at once like a winner. We took the trade in the general upward trend, the slope wasnt too steep, and moreover, the price bounced right on the pivot level. In fact, it worked like a charm. The second one was a bit more dangerous, first, because it was a counter trade, and second, it came from a very steep slope (more than 45°). In such case, caution is mandatory, and it's all up to the trader's experience. But, we can notice that, the last bull bar did not close over the R2 line, and we do have a nice doji bar at the top before the breakout bar. Also, the stochastics (not shown) were just leaving the overbought zone and moving down. So, it was a risk worth being taken, and it paid off quite well. Trendlines can be as accurate as any other trading method, and often, even more. This forum is just great and I hope we can keep giving support and feedback as we approach a new exciting trading week!

I drew the trend line chart on friday morning 17/09/10 and took the short on friday us session and collected 80 pip

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I woke up a bit late and missed a good trendline break. Let's see if it's going to reach at least the first resistance line.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi I have question as in how do you know which range to draw the trend line? and how do you know if its broken?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
You see, drawing trendlines is very subjective. Usually, those with a long range are said to be more reliable, although this is not a rule. Generally, the more times a trendline has been touched before being broken, the better it is. You can clearly see whether a trendline has been broken when the close of the last candle (not the low or the high) has breached through the line itself. There is a good number of examples in this thread.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Well. This is really easy system. But some conditions that I know maybe develop this. First of all no need to use less than M15 False signals are lot. So for the second what we need for drawing real TREND LINE. Just 2 min (for Uptrend) or max (for Downtrend). All right. Now look at the positions just when drawing the trend lines. It's my opinion and I called this positions 50/50 ; 80/20 ; 95/5 1. 50/50 If you draw the trend line from 2 min which the second one upper the first one, but action from second min doesn't break the maximum between thin minimums. So I called this position 5050. From other side this figure is also known like Symmetric triangular http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/1348/5050.gif By the way If trend line was break, we have to remove that one. 2. 80/20. In this case after breaking the max or min (5;6) we'll have the direction where we can earn some profits. http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/2536/8020.gif If the trend line was break so we have the new trend and no need to draw from new second maximum the trend line from old direction. This can be drawn, but some conditions need(tell later) 3. 95/5. This setup approximately prove itself always. So if price break resistance, that resistance turn support for Price. If test that support continue the new direction and test the trend line third time, so we can buy. http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/4605/955p.gif Results: Never redraw the trend line if it was broken! Always buy If the up trend was retested or the down trend was broken. How can we away False breaking the TL? Good question. About this and when we can redraw the TL later...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Feliks, thanks for your charts and for showing your approach to trendlines trading. We never stop learning. Did any of you trade the early trendline break I have previously shown? (n.1 on the chart below) It paid off quite nicely, although on monday mornings the market doesn't move much. If you had a fixed TP of, say, 30 pips, you would have got them effortlessly. But we also had another chance a few hrs later, when we had a strong bar crossing the 2nd trendline, and the following bar going all the way down through the Pivot point. I took 35 pips on that, ending the trade at the close of the 2nd bear bar.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
First of all thanks for replying. But it would be better if you zoom out your chart. Because when you are zooming out the chart you get more information than this one. And your trend lines are not seems right at all. Drawing the trend lines you have to start from Monthly and end on H4 or H1. Remember! The trend will valid if price breaks max or min between 2 minimums or maximums. Another condition will be third touch and testing last resistance now like support or vise versa.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Excuse me, but your trend line was broken and this one drawing is wrong. If you trend line was broken, don't redraw just you have a new trend. http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/180/63931838.jpg

--- 帖子 #209 ---
@ Feliks: thank you for your input. More precious info for all of us. I don't usually trade long time frames, on the other hand there are people who love scalping with 5m and even 1m chart, I am at ease with something in between, all is subjective. I zoomed in my pictures only to show them better. Here's another real time trade I've just taken on the EUR/USD 30m chart, any comment is appreciated.

I have understood that trading short term - like mins charts - is not a very good idea since it is not possible to make money. The only chance I think we have is to employ simple and logn term strategies. I might be wrong, but you will need to prove that somehow...

Can be done on M1 - two trades worth 55 pips on EURUSD. I'm using the linegraph to draw the trendlines.

A double cross of the EURUSD H1 - - price-cross two trendlines in a single move. Should be a nice trade - time will tell. Edit: Took profit 44 pipper

--- 帖子 #215 ---
where to draw the trendlines is my main problem. i always seem to get it wrong, with false breakouts. also what is the best TF to use ? whats happened to the original thread starter ? he seems to have dissapeared.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi folks, this thread seems a bit slow. Im very interested in this method. Trendline breaks provide very high momentum moves and that is goood Is anyone here taking the trendline breaks *with* the trend or are they being taken in any direction? My focus right now is taking trades with the trend, wait for corrective move which tends to create a retracement trendline, and then enter once the pullback is completed (hopefully this being the trendline break). Anyone here doing anything similar and if so how you getting on? Also which are the main timeframes being used? cheers Pip

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Cause you draw wrong trend lines. And not so far all breakouts are valid. Remember where you draw trend line wait on that TF its breaking! Best TF forever Daily. Because All technical trading methods are created on Daily charts..

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Your trading are good, I hope a lot of traders (including me) doing so. Above I wrote Daily for best TF. But I include so Two types of trading you have to choose: Long or Middle term trading - Mn Weekly Daily H4 (entry) Short term trading - H4 H1 M30 M15 Thats it...

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Can be done in M1 - Below the M1 EURUSD - 47 pips

Trendlines, I just love them, nice to be able to read through this thread and pick up some valuable information to better on trendline breaks.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Was'nt in on this M1 AUDUSD double cross - worth more than 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Another double cross - this time the M1 GBPUSD - worth more than 50 pips

--- 帖子 #223 ---
hi Kinko can you elaborate more on your method, i feel i missing the clue *for example the M1 AUDUSD chart, why you choose point A &amp; B to draw trendline and not A &amp; X = blue line i draw ? *what exactly do you mean by "double cross" *and how do you anticipate the break will be go up or break down if you dont mind to answer and explain a bit, i thank you for it mike

--- 帖子 #224 ---
My definition of a double cross: When you have two trendlines - one from the north(top) and one from the south (bottom) intersecting and you have the price line crossing both trendlines on the right hand side of the intersection and relatively close to the intersection. See the image for some examples.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
A multiple double cross - very strong movement

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I am drawing new trendlines as time goes by and deleting old ones no longer valid. So it is an ongoing process all the time. In this instance I only kept the two trendlines I wanted to highlight and deleted all the other - to show what I wanted without to much confusion So to answer the question - At the time when X was formed I had a trendline from A to X. Most of the times the trendlines will tell you where the price is heading. There are times when you have a clean break to one side and the price will turn around and create a double cross to the other side. And you will never know until it happens. To take advantage of this the first trade I do without a hard stoploss. In the place of the stoploss I will place a Buystop/ sellstop in the other direction with a volume of two or three times my initial trade. So when price moves against my first trade it will trigger the double or tripple volume trade in the other direction and I will in most cases kill both trades when they are equal - resulting in a net zero trade or small loss or small gain depending on the price movement. But it can backfire on you - so be careful with this kind of trading

--- 帖子 #227 ---
i see thx

--- 帖子 #228 ---
will it be more accurate to apply this simple technique on higher time frame? like 4hr charts.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I see no reason why it cannot be used in the higher timeframes See the GBPUSD weekly.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi Kinko.....based on your weekly chart is this will be your entry points (Buy , Sell ).......?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Yes - price must close on the other side to be valid - sometimes price will cross both lines but turns back and close inside the triangle - wait for it to close on the outside of the triangle.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
adding this thread to my "must visit" bag

--- 帖子 #233 ---
lets see how this will work out

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I don't normally trade the 4h chart, but in the following example, we have an ongoing trade from a trendline break (n.1) occurred a couple of weeks ago and that, if held, it would still be valid and would have cashed 600 pips so far. Of course, we would have to find the best strategy for a max TP. I'm testing a couple of indicators for exits. As pointed out by Alihuzaifa in the previous post, there's another opportunity which MAY happen in the following days, that is the break of the 2nd upper trendline. Let's wait and see...

--- 帖子 #235 ---
this makes complete sense to me.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
OK lets see what is going to happen to these two after the double trendline break. Edit: EURUSD and GBPUSD both failed

--- 帖子 #237 ---
entry seems easy but what about exit? any body have any idea about it?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
There's some odd looking trendlines drawn in there (top).

--- 帖子 #239 ---
For exits I follow the trendline for trend trades. Counter trend, I use the approaching tl as a target. Just like rob bookers two trendy.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
My exit was a bit premature on this trendline break but still 60 pips OK for today

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Now waiting for a possible retracement short entry on the GBPUSD H1

one beautiful TL BREAK OUT in GU. I draw this TL YESTERDAY for the shorting purpose and at the time of us market it just breached the tl and asia moved it up

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Gu may be will break or move back... GBPUSD broke above 1.5997 previous high resistance, suggesting that the uptrend from 1.4230 has resumed. Further rise is still possible next week and next target would be at 1.6200-1.6300 area. Support is at 1.5665, only break below this level would indicate that the rise from 1.5296 has completed, then another fall to 1.5200 area could be seen. For long term analysis, GBPUSD is in uptrend from 1.4230. Rise to 1.8000 area to reach next cycle top on weekly chart is expected in next several months

--- 帖子 #246 ---
EU moved up in the trend line till the close of uk session breached during us and doubled bottom created and asia picked it up. kind of tricky one for who were in the short side

--- 帖子 #248 ---
i agreed, as what i experienced, most of methods works, it is our emotions which we should blame for losses. either a early entry or early exit ruins the results.whatever trading method you are using believe in it after testing it on demo account. if it works for two months. then sure it will work third month on real account.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Would this be a valid entry?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Two of my EU trade yesterday one long for 80 pip and ond short for 50 pip I saved the picture at the time of entry check it out

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Here's how the Euro looked for me today. I took the first entry on my live account and observed the second. I use pivot points to inform exits. The first is a break above the trend line in the morning which I entered long on the retrace. First target was MS1 and second was the daily pivot. The second entry could have been taken around US open, targeting the Daily pivot, or the fib retrace of the morning's rally. Good for maybe, 70 - 80 pips between them and stop losses can be tight on this time frame. Looks like a head and shoulders, doesn't it? Good targets on the short side would be the 50% &amp; 61.8% fibs. http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/l...f?t=1289316956

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi Jhig, I noticed your system states 'strong trend'. Can you share why this criteria for your system? Eg, what if a weak trendline is used? The possible impact, or its advt/disadvts?? The System ***The general dynamics of this system stays the same. *** 1) Find the upwards trend, 2) Apply the trendline, 3) Price Action breaks downwards through the trendline Our first step is to locate a strong upwards trend. Apply a trendline to help visually spot out that trend and to use as an "barrier" for Price Action. Now we wait for Price Action to breakthrough the trendline and head downwards, in which a SELL order may now be entered. The chart below is an example of a trade setup we are looking for.

Hello Just discovered this thread and plan to give it a good thorough read....but I am just about to get onto a plan for a weeks vacation where there is no internet but lots of sun. Do you folks place pending orders for trend line breaks? I find that there can be false break outs and I would like to be around to close a losing trade......but then on the other hand lots of break outs happen when I am not there staring at the screen.....so pending orders seems to be the way to go. Anyways.....I do hope that this thread continues and people post lots of examples.....so i can read it when I return. PGPB

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hallo P,i'll wait you to came back from holiday to share some trades with this method...it's really a simple (not easy) one. Enjoy the sun...

Thanks Benem.....I just browsed through your FF journal....looks like you are an avid J16 fan. ....good for you....I had think long and hard what BRN was....(figured it out) what are your thoughts on placing pending orders for break outs. that is the one thing I am "worried" about with trend line breaks and S&amp;R breaks. Anyways......see you on the forum in a week......I will be back....with a sun tan PGPB

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi P i didn't trade this system yet but as a resoult of a quick back testing i would wait to place a pending order once the candle has closed below ( or above in case of long)the Trend line. But as everithing in trading we should test different entry mothod as different exits to see in the long run wich give us a better Win/loss ratio....or better to call it "R" factor. Remember system represent only a 10% of your success( maybe you already know that)the rest is Money management and the strenght to adere to your trading plan and overcame the fear you feel (psicology). Hope didn't bored all the other guys with my post,in case sorry. Luca

Hello folks. Here's a trend line break I took this morning. Unfortunately I only took a small chunk of what was on offer. Starting from the left, I see a gap circled with a red oval, these are 'filled' by price most of the time, indicating price will go down. The yellow lines are a fibo fan from a previous trend line, just ignore that. The blue lines indicate a channel... notice there was a break down but it was very close to the Open price. This is a strong S&amp;R and kept me out of the trade. Sure enough, price bounced off it. R2 is also there indicating further caution. Next we have a horizontal and diagonal trend line in red that combine to make an ascending triangle. A break either way would have taken me into a trade, and I went short after the break at 1.3733, with a 12 pip stop. I only picked up around 20 pips on this trade, however over 100 were on offer, the only trigger was a simple break of a trend line with a tight stop. http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/l...f?t=1290433512

Here's how the Euro looked this morning, beautiful day for trend line breaks, a basic knowledge of chart patterns helps too. Here we have a triangle and a bearish wedge.

We all now about news it moves back and forth 100 times and as an intraday trader I dont want to read a news which happened 5 hour and reported two hours after that by the time the chart will look different and if you go by that news to go long or short the pair you will feel sad about it. News is good for us to get an overall judgment about the currencey but for you to get the pip (not talking about our calendar) All you need is market to market direction which is provided in the chart. Find out from your chart what was the previouse high or low of the last session and start connecting it and get the feel of the market. M15 chart gives you in one view the 2 days worth of trading. I use M5 to get in and get out of the trade in minimum possible time.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I love trendlines but I have found for example when the market is ranging say on the hourly. It gets difficult to trade the 5 min. A nice established medium to long term trend works best for trend lines. IMO of course. Has any one ran into this same problem. I find that for things to clear up I have to wait till the hour makes a new high or low to draw new trend lines.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
there are many different signals that a trendline can give, but its mostly tide together to the market cycle/session. This isn't 100% ALL THE TIME. Asian- trendline can be used as support-resistance- Bounce London - Trendline normally becomes break out point- Break US- Trendline can be break out then retest of support - Break + Bounce so the time(news, market open/closing) has a big impact on what the trendlines wll display on the chart. Agreed with the trendlines are great for trend direction. Bounce off support = $

--- 帖子 #289 ---
How does this system work. I can only read english.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I've tried many different trading strategies, but I keep coming back to basic trendlines. They really seem to fit with my style of trading. However, the one problem I always have is getting out of a trade too early. Can anyone share their methods of exiting a trade. I really need some help in this area. Thanks Gembug

--- 帖子 #291 ---
To avoid getting out too early i close only half the position at certain point, and the second half i move to BE and then its a let it go...hit my BE or my second target...i dont care risk is ZERO

--- 帖子 #292 ---
How to stay in longer? Have a goal and follow through. Use TP and SL and trailing stops, in the photo below, I entered two more positions with Trendline breaks to average down into this long position. The Tp is in play and a trailing stop will adjust SL as needed. I will have to walk away and let the market do its thing, otherwise I too would be closing too early for small pips. when i come back in the asain session, i will readjust if needed by adding More, or tighten SL if the LONG position does not look possible in the next week. I'll have to wait for further PA to draw Trendlines again-&gt;&gt; once drawn I'll be able to set this up for another day, and see what happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Trendline is great, but sometimes once u got the wrong trend, you get it all wrong. Best is u draw the trend of a bigger timeframe first. Don't micro to mini trends.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Nice nice strategy, i presume you enter big contract size??

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Empyrium, Thanks for your response. I will certainly give that a go. Makes a lot of sense to me. What do you use to determine your 2 different profit targets? Are these fixed prices or determined by price action? Thanks

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I use defined support and resistance lines drawn from the previous OHLC, monthly, weekly, daily.. add that to your daily pivots lines. Second, look for "well defined" areas where support turns to resistance or resistance turns to support on the time frame you are trading M5, H1, etc. You will need to exapand your chart ( add more candles - looking left ) in order see these areas more clearly...This will give you targets to shoot for. Much easier to stay in the trade that way. You will also begin to see where multiple lines are close to one another.. Areas of major support or resistance. You will also notice sometimes you will have a lot of room for the move, other times not so much. Areas where price will most likely stall ( great if you are trading multiple lots ) and possibly keep moving. Great thread here ...!!!

Hello, I have one question and one observation. my question is of all the 5 star trading systems, this one is on top. does that mean this is the best system of all the 5 star systems. you can find this by pressing rating twice. first time will see all the systems with no stars, and second time will show systems starting from the 5 stars down to no stars. I trade much, much less these days. but I did observe what Jhig said and tried to do only higher TF's. In the last 45 days, I only took 4 trades. 4/4 were winners using risk to reward of 2:1. there was also a 5th trade where I closed it on my own because it seemed to be going nowhere after 3 days which I took a loss of 50 pips on, but if I had kept it, it would have gone on to be a winner. All trades were either 4H or 1H. I entered and exited the most simple way you can think of. 4H with a 300 pip TP and 150 pip SL. 1H with a 100 pip TP and 50 pip SL. all preset. i would like to ask the thread starter, if I continued with this, month in month out, what kind of results should I expect? Although I have yet to take a loss, but I reckon winning even half long term would be great due to the risk:reward ratio. The reason I am asking, is because once I can affirm this, it would be my interest to go into each trade with a much larger sum of money.

Hi Chiba Your funny man. It is first based on when you posted time wise, click rating again and first thread will be 2006! This one was way down the list because it is not active, look at previous post date. Doesn't mean the method is good or bad, just not currently active. cheers

--- 帖子 #305 ---
goldsurfer, that is not true. I understand what you are saying about the most active ones are near the top, with the one with the most recent post right at the top. if you click the ratings button, trendline break (the only system you need) will always be at the top of the 5 star systems no matter what.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Er, well maybe it is random, the rating system is just user votes, like % who give it 5 stars vs % who give it 1, saying it is best or worst is like saying one girl is prettier than another or mashed potatoes is better than rice if you catch my drift.... cheers

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I wish I would have found this thread way earlier. I just started using trendlines about a month ago. What a difference in my trading. I'll get home from work, draw the trendline on the E/U, then sit back and wait. An easy way to bag some pips while getting some screen time under my belt. I found a great read last night in regards to trendlines. I don't know if anyone else has read this or not. It even goes further into the subject.

Can you please upload the Gree Line Indicator running with heiken ashi as shown in this pic.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Sorry mate, it's not an indicator. As the OP said, to see the HA candles clearly you need to go to a line chart rather than standard candles. The Line Chart option is the one on the right of the Candlestick option, to the left of the + and - Zoom In and Zoom Out choices with the wee magnifying glass, on the standard MT4 charts.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Interesting system but I think it's ot usable when we are in range market and intraday. Signals aren't clear enough to open trades. But it's more usable in larger TF like H1 or D1, no?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hey, this thing actually works very well. And I noticed that there is no need to connect whole trend with a trendline. Its enough to connect last two most obvious points.

Funny how the threads that are the simplest, most effective and require as few indicators as possible seem to die down the quickest! Before I started trading trendlines I spent months trying to find a strategy that fitted my style of trading. By stripping back what I thought I needed and concentrating on the basics, I found that I felt far more comfortable trading trendlines than anything else... Price action for me anyway is the way forward and trendlines have made a massive impact on me and my trading. For those who want a definitive trend line drawing software, I'd check out this site http://www.truetl.com/index.html ....yes you need to pay for it...but...its like 5 quid a month and cheaper if you pay for a lifetime license. I only pay attention to the 3 touch lines and the longer orange trendlines which act as major support and resistance. I'm using this in conjuction with the 200 SMA to gauge price direction and the symphonie trading system as a confirmation tool also. The 5 EMA is also used and once that breaks through a trend line the chances of a successful trade massively increase. Regardless of how you trade trendlines and what you use for confirmation, it seems this way of trading puts you on the winners side more than the losers. Any more recommendations on reading material for trendline trading?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
how can we distinguish between a break and a reverse?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I couldn't agree more. Thanks for the link, btw. I checked their site and paid my 5 bucks, im curious to test this. What i find interesting is the TL break alert indy, apart from the TL indy itself.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
It's not reading, but you'd probably be interested in Haru Miyagi's youtube vids. I've been trading using a semi-automatic S/R/ trendline EA for over a year now. It's far less stressful and more common-sense than some of the indi-ridden "systems" out there.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I just wanted to keep this thread alive. This seems like a very good way to trade.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
hi all i have only started reading this thread (about half way) looks like a simple concept does the chart below present a valid setup?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I am not sure exactly what setup you are referring to but if the last bearish candle closes below the trendline you have drawn then that would be the place to go short. Is this what you are referring to?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
thats exactly what i meant it didnt exactly go to plan but a short would have been worth while

--- 帖子 #321 ---

--- 帖子 #322 ---
The problem with all this is you have taken a chart of some time frame, looked back and found a few trend line brakes that would have produced winning trades. Yes they work about half of the time. But how to do in real time. Where to take profit, where to place stop loss?? It looks much different in real time. You are better off using a couple of indicators to give you a reason to pull the trigger, take partial profit at some point, let the balance run to some back tested point, place your stop loss at the last high/low and hope over a month you come out winners. Find a system that has one trend and one oscillator and back test until you formulate a plan. It is all a form of educated gambling. If you look at your 5 min chart you can draw about 100 trend lines. Which one to trade?? JJ

--- 帖子 #323 ---
you are correct JJ, i havent yet developed this into a system. at this stage just learning the pure trendline signals and trying to perfect the best trendline (as you pointed out there are 100 you can draw). once confident i will want to introduce other signals and then start the money management is this a decent plan?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Instead of identifying and drawing 100 trendlines, why not you choose the recent highest point and lowest point? Please take note while drawing an uptrend line: The second low must be higher than the first for the line to have a positive slope and while drawing an downtrend line: The second high must be lower than the first for the line to have a negative slope. Below is the latest EUR/USD as an example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have been tired of being a daytrader so I only trade daily chart. Even if it is a short term breakout, I can still net pretty much profits (pips) since the daily volume is apparently higher compared to those on lower TFs. I hope I make it clear and simple, sorry if my English is poor. Just use my template if you are like my chart.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Thanks Amikaking for ur explanation. my question now is from your trend line that u have drawn what is the next move if price breaks the upper of lower line?

I have a bullish outside bar for the A/$ @ 08:03 ct/us (-6GMT) I entered 3 pips above the high of the signal bar @1.0410 - I hope it goes for a nice ride but volume does seem low this morning. edit 09:20 I failed to notice two congestion zones around Nov 11th and Nov 7th - both lasted for more than one day. My buy was right into those zones, should have looked left!

AUD/USD I got out of this for minus 11 pips, 4 down candles was enough for me although the SL was for 27 (I think) pips. It is starting to come back but there is some red flag Aussie news this evening and I'll take a smaller loss over hope. The Tue NY session has some big news too; this might not be a good week to trade with the US holiday on Thu and Fri.

This is a bullshit . Starter of this thread is a looser. All know that on history all are wall-street traders.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I captured +30 pips with the E/Y, 1H TF this morning. I closed early as it put me in profit for the week and month. And by the way it's "his pants are looser proving he is not a loser controlling his weight."

Just read the entire thread, and its great info! The more people that post and share examples the more we can all learn and fine tune for ourselves. Questions- 1. What is a goond indi that can help minimize bad trades? I see people posting RSI, Divergence, fibo retrace and a CCI 50 or 9, and 200MA with a 5MA. Can anyone clear this up on a " how to use" them correctly? 2. Some people posted about Pivots, is there indi that will do it for you in a clear manner? 3. When drawing the trendline on a higher time frame, like the day to the hour to the 30m, do you adjust the trend line as you more down to a lower time frame or leave the trendline of the higher time frame. That is all for now! Keep posting!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
1-) it depends on you. but, indicators can also cause to minimize good trades as well, be aware of that. i think using no indicator or mixing some indicators best way. i prefer no indicator. 2-) no idea 3-) i dont adjust. if i draw trendline on 4h chart, i enter trades only by looking 4h chart. otherwise it will be confused. but this may also depending on you. you have to experience best-worst ways. this was one of the easiest trade. i know talking about past charts is easy, but chance of these types of trades are very high always... trendline break+ re-test that line again.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Looks good. How effective are trend line breaks for you? I assume you account for other things?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
eur/usd same senario. trendline break + now it retests the line.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
well my statistics like winning ratio: %41 average profit / average loss: 2.8 not very well but it worths to work on trend line break more.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
How are you going with this Prestij? I personally like to see 3 touches of a TL before I consider it valid. Looking at your post number 341 that trend line you drew could have been drawn many times, in many places. Is that picture simply the last time you drew it after moving it so many times? Waiting for 3 touches will avoid that problem to some extent. Also as the author sais he looks for a candle pattern at the breakout. I like to see an engulfing candle at the breakout.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
sorry for my late answer. not only 341 please look at my post 343. it hit sl. it was perfect setup for me, but it hit sl. i couldnt make a system that works +%60 winning ratio when r/r ratio is around 3. dont consider spread and swap. lets open trades with unconsciously. put 30 pips sl and 60 pips tp. in the long run u will get %33.3 winning ratio. if u consider supports+resistance, winning ratio should increase like %40. if u both consider supports+resistance+trendline winning ratio should be +%40. even if u choose wrong support+resistance at the end your account will be 0 profit but also 0 loss. then why most people loose money. i believe that the system you use is not important. if you can use right money management, even if you are fool to not know resistance or support, you will not loose money. and yes if you use 3 touches and looking candle pattern, your winning ratio should be +%50 and you will make more money than me. i am not as patiance as you are. but it is enough for me if price looks like to listen trendline or trendline break or resistance or whatever. i added my friday trade. after 2 candle, i think price consider the trendline i draw. it is not perfect trade setup but it is enough for me. and i open trade in third candle with my restrict money management rule. i never get out the trade if i dont earn 2 x stoploss level. i hope these helps.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I will try this: 1 Wait for Close below trendline . 2 Look for 8 stochastic to be OB (otherwise wait till fast line crosses down from OB) it´s a good filter.! Original stop: is last, obvious Pivot above entry. 3 Trail stochastic 13 (on Pivot of course) to give the trade more room to expand. 4 Exit on Close above the trend line , which would be a Long Signal (if you want to trade also Long) 5 No TP, to catch those homeruns here and there, that do marvels to your account. 6 Trade only UK/ US sessions.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
It does "work" but as people are pointing out, it seems that "drops" are faster and longer than "pops.' There's no reason you can't trade both ways, but success in anything in life does come down to focusing on the most efficient, effective methods, so there is some wisdom in focusing on the shorts. Myself there are times I am bored and just "want" to trade, which is a bad habit. So I will go bull. Other times it seems most of the charts are in uptrends, again, might look for a bearish retracement in a bull trend to trade. It was so much easier when the USD had its long drawn out bear trend, because that is what most of the big pairs are based on. I don't mean to contradict anyone, just adding my perspective on what was said in the thread. Edit: Also just had another thought after reading a few more posts as to why I prefer shorts. Shorts seem to "retest" the trend line break or even s/r break a lot less often. It goes back to psychology. People panic or at least get nervous when they see a long white candle. Bullish breaks seem to always retest, or at least more than 50% of the time.

hi, can someone enlighten me? if i want to place a pending order on trend line break out method, how do i know at which point/price it will break? does it mean that i need to keep watching the screen to take a position?? coz the price can reverse and break at an unknown time and price level....thanks in anticipation of your response...cheers

TF, a 10-15 pip above/below the previous hi or low OR the prev. hi or low itself depending on the circumstances. I may miss some pips in the beginning but I'm sure the price is going my way when a trade is entered. But I would be very cautious of that 3rd candle to the left, it's huge. Be careful.

Hey all, first post but i've been stalking the forums for quite a while now, just made an account now as i'm really confused about what i've been doing wrong here. 5 times in a row now it breaks the trendline, closes below it leading me to sell, then just rises back up, putting me deeper and deeper into loss. Here's a picture of the latest one, was this a valid trendline? Am I doing something wrong? thanks all

Great simple strategy. Like many traders I feel as if I’ve played with just about every indicator under the sun but it wasn’t until I got back to simplicity that things began to turn around. I love simplicity! Anyways, I trade trendline breaks (buy or sell). The only variation is that I use one indicator (only one!) to confirm the trendline break. I use MACD with settings of 3,10,1. Once there is a close outside the trendline I wait until the MACD goes negative or positive depending on the direction of my trade. I only trade the AUD/USD. Spread is a bit higher but I like it’s price action better than the EUR/USD. I set my S/L to 10 and T/P to 10 as well. I stop trading when I am net +1.5 for the day. So for example, risking 4% per trade I would net 6% for the day. I usually move my S/L to even in the area of 6 pips. It also helps to be aware of the 50% level of the move. The last setup in the example below ran straight to the 50% level on the setup bar. I should’ve waited for a pull back but it worked out anyways…barely!

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Here is what has panned out so far today on the AUD/USD 5M. Trade 1 - Steep trendline which knocked me out. Hindsight; waiting for trend slope to decrease would have been wiser. Trade 2 - Successful with a 10 pip stop. Trade 3 - Loss. Sometimes these short trendlines work and sometimes they don't. Not every trade wins. Trade 4 - Possible reentry point if you didn't catch trade 2 or reversed when trade 3 showed up. I'm currently watching for the uptrendline to break to the downside. Note, there is nice divergence showing on the 1H timeframe. Also there was 5m divergence showing prior to trade 2 reinforcing the up move.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Here is the break of the uptrend line that I mentioned above. Next setup I'm watching for is a close above the downtrend line with confirmation on the MACD.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
This trade was good for about 8 pips minus spread. Enough to get to even or just take a few and call it a day. Note that hidden divergence showed up which could be used as an exit trigger or signal to tighten stops.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I use this method also, mostly on Jpy pairs 15m. I trade it buy and sell when it enters areas supply and demand.

I was a technical anlayst in stocks and a prop trader for a few years. Now I am a full time forex trader trying to figure out this forex game. I find your post on trendline break strategy very interesting. Personally I am not using trendline break to generate trading signal. But I am incorporating this in my multi-timeframe micro-trend trading strategy that I am working on. I use trendline break and moving averages to tell me if all the three timeframe charts all point to the same trending direction. If all the three timeframe chart tell me that market is in uptrend , then I will only go long. The converse is also true. The attached is my trades.

Hi. This is my first time posting. I've had a fascination with trendlines since my first commercial trading strategy failed and I needed to get back to basics. I've spent the last few weeks coding a custom indicator to draw trendlines on indicators (e.g. Moving average, MACD, RSI, etc.). I've been visually seeing these trendlines and haven't been able to trust them until I was able to systematically draw every one of them! So after 100s of hours of sweat and tears I've got this wow indicator. In this version (4) it draws trendlines on moving averages (and by setting moving average=1, it draws based on close, high, low, both, all three). It really opens up the trading opportunities on trendlines. I had the 'mad' idea that I could find good trading opportunites by changing the period of the indicator until it allowed the drawing of a 3 point trendline. An immediate reaction could be that this would over-optimising, however in my experience it doesn't. It does identify natural rhythms that are hidden in waves of price movement. I don't want to hijack this forum, so I'll start a new forum as soon as I can as a new member. I'm keen to collaborate as I'm a bit tired from all the single-minded focus on coding! This indicator outputs the breakouts to an IndexBuffer so it could be fed into an EA. The indicator doesn't qualify whether a trendline is worth trading (ie whether its a reversal or moving into a consolidation, there's price confirmation, MACD confirmation, risk/reward, etc.). So I'm keen to work with others who can provide the EA and optimisation components to test filters. The green line is the close price (candles turned off). The orange is the last drawn indicator period (ie EMA(7-9) shows EMA(9) on screen). The grey lines are the tolerance for a trendline touch on the 2nd apex. Dotted lines are trendlines that have had breakouts, solid are still active. (The 1,2,3 apex markers can be turned off). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Daily: Using exponential MA(periods=9 to 12) on close with duplicates removed that share 2 time points. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Daily: This one is opening the parameters wider - EMA(7-12) on close with all duplicates. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 4 hour: Close price only i.e. EMA(1) with duplicates removed. It can also plot high &amp; low price values (like traditional high/low trendlines), however I need to tighten the code as it currently shows breakouts long and short on both high and low prices (rather than long breakouts on highs &amp; short breakouts on lows). Attached Image (click to enlarge) 4 hour: EMA(7-9) with duplicates removed. Future development - v4 - improve duplication removal algorithm, restrict high &amp; low price plotting to traditional method, v5 (next year) - open code up to trendlines on any indicator you wish, drawn in a separate window. Try it out... (place in Indicators folder of MT4 and then draw into chart window) Attached File(s) 3rd Wave Algorithm 4.4.ex4 39 KB | 978 downloads Variables worth initial testing are: INDperiod1, INDperiod2, TouchTolApex2, DrawPoints, RemoveDuplicates The default values are set on exponential moving average 7-12 of close price, ATR(90) tolerance of 0.05 for apex 2, showing draw points, removing duplicates. Settings are described in more detail here... Attached File(s) Variables described.txt 2 KB | 459 downloads (Time limit on this version: 15 Jan 2015. After that date trendlines are delayed by 45 bars. I'll have another version by then, though. I'm not sure whether to release the source code to people I'm collaborating with, release it unequivocally, or later sell it on mlq5 marketplace. Any feedback/experience welcome. I have no experience of selling indicators/EAs). One more for fun... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Wide open parameters - EMA(5-21) with duplicate trendlines not removed (based on default = close) P.S. Have you noticed what happens when trendlines converse or diverge? I'm seeing that converging trendlines often have the goodies, identify a major transition point at the point that they cross (a reversal, breakout or end of a trend), where as divergent trendlines lead to resistance waves / consolidation. Or is it just my imagination? P.S. Fx4chick - A simple EA could test the 3rd Wave Algorithm indicator for a recent breakout in three timeframes. How often do they happen? Within how many bars of the lower timeframe can the breakout in the higher timeframe be, to qualify for trading?

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I've made quite a few improvements and there's still a few more needed to the code. Not all possible trendlines are being drawn. I should have a new version in a couple of weeks. More display &amp; testing options have been added. (e.g. added option to not display trendlines that price does not confirm breakout in next x bars. Good for looking back and seeing only historical trendlines you would have actually traded using a strategy of price exceeding breakout bar). Plus added a traditional trendline override option, to display only high low trendlines on price. This is set as the default.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Version 4.85 is performing better than expected. No errors found so far. The main variables to change to get the trendlines you want are: TouchTolApex2 - tolerance of apex 2/wave 2 on the trendline (e.g. 0.005-0.2), default=0.05 EarlyBreakoutBars - number of bars needed at start and end of trendline before price crosses (e.g. 0-10), default=4 FreeTolTL - distance (freedom) wave needs from trendline to be counted as a new apex (e.g. 0-1) I can see it's getting downloaded. Let me know if you spot any anomalies. Next version will have an optional gradient/angle filter &amp; output breakouts to an indexbuffer

Thanks Dragos. That's a great method using MACD. Latest version - has new feature of only displaying breakouts that are confirmed by another breakout within x bars. Set as default in this version. Also default set to draw trendlines on EMA 7-12, and not traditional trend lines. See documentation.

This version has the setting for a bounce strategy, not breakouts, using trendlines on the EMA for periods 1-12. Try these additional settings to: RemoveDuplicates=true; MinLengthTL=100; DisplayActiveTLOnly= false ; With DisplayActiveTLOnly=true, you will get false information about past trading opportunities as it removes all data from that screen from past breakouts. So it's like a repaint and looks too good to be true. MinLengthTL=100; or another value. Current version default=15; RemoveDuplicates=true; removes the trendline that has two time points in common with another trendline. Further note: The 3 in a circle is the 3rd bounce and it is drawn on the close of the next bar. So on the screen it is repainting back two bars. The 3 has been drawn in the last screenshot at the close of the red bar. Good luck with it.

thanks for the clues Paul mad that I am ...I like to see the old TLs as I think they can resurrect at times loving the indi it just got me in early on the brealkup of gbp/euro 5 min with some odd confluence I would have never thought to draw... What about the blue and red arrows ? TL break? thankx and good pips[/quote] The blue &amp; red arrows are when the bar has closed above the trendline (ie a breakout or failed breakout) I'll keep in mind to add a switch so that you can still see the old trendlines that have had breakouts. I think they would need to be a second trendline so that they can be a different &amp; faint colour, otherwise the screen would be overwhelmed with them, and to be able to distinguish easily between pre &amp; post breakout. As you said, my hope was that by using the moving average trendlines we would be able to see opportunities that were not immediately obvious using traditional trendlines. It will be interesting to see the results when I can add other moving averages - like triangular and zero-lag EMA. It would also be interesting to add a simple backtest within the indicator to give a quick way of testing which averaging methods give the best breakouts/bounces, for that currency pair. However I'm a slow coder, so that's a while away!

this thread was started with a very simple concept and yet so profitable system if applied properly. as usual, this is now polluted by so many aliens and geniuses.

Lol... Totally agreed with you, people forget beauty of system and simplicity.

Here is updated version of the moving average &amp; traditional trendline indicator. I've added ability to change colours and added option for all trendlines to be rays so they don't stop at breakout (as requested). Update for redraw bug (on new bar) and speed enhancement coming soon. Note: some defaults have been changed : MinLengthTL=30; // Minimum length for trendlines (also affected by MinWavePeriod, e.g. if MinWavePeriod=5, minimum length=5*3waves=15) RemoveDuplicates=true; // Removes duplicate trendlines from different periods of an indicator (sharing 2 points in time in common) DisplayActiveTLOnly=false; // true = Show only currently active trendlines (ie no breakouts yet) - NOT GOOD FOR HISTORICAL ANALYSIS DisplayRayForAllTL=false; // default=false: inactive trendlines stop being drawn when breakout occurs See above post for full description of adjustable variables.

Hi, I'm a new joiner, searching high and low on logics sample of PA and trendline. I'm quite loss stumbled on this thread. Is this a EA or just indicator? Do we add in trendline ourselves?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Sounds like the way i trade too...a combo of trendlines and triangles...especially "mini" triangle b/o's! Im interested in seeing some of your charts with entries.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi Ihig I would appreciate to have a trendline with an alarm in case it is broken. Could you help me with a hint where to go? Thanks

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Very nice system. I use it when I see an opportunity. The way I enter a trade is through scaling in - first 1/3rd of the full position I place once the candle which brakes the TL closes on the opposite side of the TL... after that I place a limit order for another 1/3rd at a half distance between the first entry and the last swing high - when selling, or the last swing low - when buying, which serves as a stop as well. Last, third chunk of the full position I enter when the price returns to the spot where I had entered the first 1/3rd and even slightly beyond. When I'm lucky and the three thirds (the whole position) are in play I scale out - I exit one third at a distance equal to the distance between the first and the second entry..... the second third I exit at a distance equal to the distance between the first entry and the stop... and the last third (after I bring the stop to BE) I allow to run until the new trend line gets broken in the opposite direction. This method, in my opinion, is mathematically advantageous and gets me comfortable and easy pips almost every time I trade. I practically never get stopped out with the whole position in play and, on occasion, I get an unbelievable amount of pips with the last third. Good luck!

Sonia, kiidnyl please show in your chart. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Well done Sonia! - How long have you been trading this way?

--- 帖子 #405 ---
This strategy works well with higher timefrimes ... larget channel is from m15 ... typically doesnt matter the breake of upper channel because it will reverse (possibly) from main trendline .. but again ! its good to combine ! it will make u nice RISK REWARD RATIO

--- 帖子 #406 ---
5:1

--- 帖子 #407 ---
that was 3rd test of m15 down trendline ... now it hit in 7:30 uptrend trendline from H1 ... SECOND pullback ... so i try LONG now

--- 帖子 #408 ---
For the past 2years i finally found this is good strategy &amp; simple. Recently on EurGbp. But i don't really know how to maximise TP. Should I close and wait for retest?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Trendline breaks on 1 min and 5 min charts are very profitable. Any TL break in the direction of the prevailing trend could result in profits. Today there were numerous ones on many currencies. My problem is that i tend to lose focus after a while ....... If traders work together on SKYPE to alert each other of setups this could work well. I will post some setups.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I'm trading this method without any indicators. Only trading GU. I haven't tried the TL alert indi yet. I've just got back to trading after some years. So I'm back to trading demo till I get comfortable again. @Cobra - I like your idea of working together via Skype. Shall we get it going next week?

--- 帖子 #420 ---
focus is a issue in itself. if you too focused you get choppy in decision making. how do you exit ? i trade the 2-7 minute charts regulary .. the main issue is how to exit. i found that fibbo extention level 83 (its not a fib number) works best .. may cut on some longer lasting moves yes but greed is the killer anyway here is my system: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=606432 same aproach .. just different way of executing

--- 帖子 #421 ---
HI, How do you use the PJ Over Price indicator with the trend break strategy?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
You could use the entry strategy for exits as well: Once you opened a trade and it moves into the right direction, draw a trendline as soon as you can and wait for a valid break of that trendline. If it breaks, get out. Pros: Huge potential profit - Cons: You need patience because the trendline can only be drawn after price moved a bit. Another Idea is to move your stop to new Highs/Lows and manually trail the dips of the trend. So when a low/high is broken, you will be sopped out with profit. Pros: Huge potential profit - Cons: price might not make a new high/low and hit you stop loss before you moved to/above breakeven. The first one is my favourite, i make nice profits by letting the trend play out as much as possible, its a great low risk/high reward exit strategy. Other options, that were mentioned here before, will get you out earlier most of the time, wich is not necessarily a bad thing, because you will have more winning trades, its personal preference: fixed risk reward exit, like 1:2 counter trend pattern exit support and resistance level exit Average true range as take profit Fibonacci expansion levels as take profit

--- 帖子 #423 ---
By the way... it obviously does not work well in an uptrend if one is only trading bearish breaks, because the retraces in a bullish trend are small. In a bearish trend on the other hand, it works incredibly well, because it is "counter-trendline-break trading WITH the trend", price continues moving into trend direction and the counter trendline break is the confirmation and entry signal. If i want to trade breaks into both directions, i need to know the trend first, and only take breaks into trend direction. By adding the 200 SMA, i instantly know which direction to trade, and just have to wait for the next counter trendline break. This seems to work really well, and is as simple and easy to execute. Did anyone had a similar experience? Of course, if you you still want to limit yourself to bearish trades, just wait until the SMA turns bearish as well.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Interested in taking a look at this, always liked trendlines but wondering if there's any indicators that help with false breakouts?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
No, but this might help to filter out a few of them: Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #426 ---
. You have a good point there. However, one can still stay just bearish but trailing stop which equals half the take profit will do some good.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi everybody! Nice thread! I love trendlines. Work out very nice in combination with s/r..

hello any one still interested on this ??!!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
***Sad to see that this thread got hijacked. The thread was about using zero indicators. I just watched that waste of time video above and it's nothing but indicators.*** I realize this is an old thread but if you're new OR if you have been struggling with hit and miss trading, then go back to page one of this thread and read it. Page one. Next, open up a pair that has been killing you, just beating you like an old mule. Now remove every single indicator including moving averages...nothing but regular Japanese candlesticks. Now open up a Daily or 4 hr chart because this will be the easiest at first (you can drop the timeframes in about a week). Now draw some trendlines and look for the breaks like Jhig said on page one. Once you train your eyes to see the trend, you are halfway there. Once you train your eyes to see the break of the trendline, you ARE there. The break of the trendline is your entry and it is also your exit. Period. If you are going LONG and exit on a pullback then just draw a new line on the top of that pullback and when price breaks, you go LONG again. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat son. The only problem with this method of trading is that you must be in front of the screen to watch it take place. But you can use your phone and just watch for new candles on whatever timeframe you're trading.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just look at this chart. It tells you when to get in and when to get out. You can do this on any timeframe but just remember that a 5 min chart will have less pips than a 4 hr chart per move. This ain't sexy but it is very effective. Edit: Looks like I cut the dates off at the bottom when I cropped it. It is from today, AUDUSD 1 hr chart

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) We were doing so good for a very poor time of the day to trade. And then, wham! New day and a gap up...but whatever. It broke the trend line and I was in on the first candle breach and out on the first candle breach. Money management. Edit: I do want to add this since I brought up money management. This method takes out hope and fear. In the past when my trade was doing the opposite of what I had intended, I was hoping. And when it did what I thought it would do, I was afraid it was gonna reverse and take away all my gains. Hope and fear are done. Now I'm methodical. Try it tonight on your demo account, any pair, any timeframe. And watch how cocky you get.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Yes. But I'm happy to have its problems told by others so I can complete it

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Thank you sir for your contribution! Great channels. These should be very helpful.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
HI kourosh1347, Playing around with your channel tool and I have to say the channels are excellent. I trade higher time frames and in the past have only been able to find a tool that only uses 2 channels. The three channel is very good. Now some quirks. Cannot be used on light backgrounds because it automatically changes background to black. I myself use Average Price Bars when trading and this automatically changes to green candle sticks. Even after I set everything to my usual template, once I change time frames it automatically changes back to black background and green candle sticks. Not complaining mind you. Just some creative criticism. Otherwise I really like what you are doing here. Nice job so far!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
The channels are excellent but I want to say if anything can be done on the automatic background and candlestick to be optional. Thanks for this great Idea

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I also have a suggestion can there be push alert at the touch of any of the three channels up or down

--- 帖子 #445 ---

Hi kourosh1347, How are you doing? I have a request pertaining to this great channel indicator, can it be auto running on all pairs that the channels is on the window and it should give alert whenever any currency pair touches the upper or lower channel of any timeframe set as desire timeframe. Also can we incorporate the idea of price action into the channel as the price touches the upper or lower time frame as proof that the trend is changing or continuing. I will send a screenshot of what I mean. I will also upload the indicator too

--- 帖子 #454 ---
hi , I can add it, but does it help us and which signal is better?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Its better to learn to read the candlesticks rather than have it tell you. Besides that indicator is very heavy on the processor of the computer.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Are you check new version?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I love trading with channels, so I'll try out this indicator this weekend with cryptos. Just looking at this though, I think that it would look cleaner if you had the option to remove the signal info from your charts. It just takes up too much space, and makes your charts looks messy. I think it would be great too if the option to receive push notification alerts were added too. Thanks, Kourosh1347!

Does not need to be buy or sell alert, Just alert on if price reach upper or lower channel lines. regards!

Hello all, By chance does anyone have an update to this indicator ? Unfortunately its expired and the creator hasn't been online in some time.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I'm no longer trading. Here is the indicator code, attached. It's 5 years since I used it. I seem to remember it didn't update all data, plus it was too slow on a fast time frame. I lost energy on the project before I found the bug. But otherwise it's a cool indicator! I don't have Metatrader installed. Looking at the code, you should just be able to delete lines 397-416 to remove the trial version limitation.
