Howdy Folks, Just wanted to share a high probability trading system to you. Its very simple, just pull out a 1hour chart any currency. Now simply wait for a bull or bear candle to form, after it closes bullish or bearish, ITS MOST LIKELY the next candle will form bull or bear candle...theres some easy pips for you. Examples: Bull candle at 8gmt, most likely 9gmt candle could be a bull candle too. Bear candle at 11gmt, most likely 12gmt candle could be a bear too. Entry Exit Rules: Bull candle --- Stoploss at the low of the previous candle, target 10-20pips or the close of the next candle. Bear candle --- Stoploss at the high of the previous candle, target 10-20pips or the close of the next candle. No trade --- If next candle starts to form against the direction of the previous candle. Note: The best bull or bear candles are ones that are one-sided or ones that have little or no wick. (strong bull/bear candle) More info, template and filters on this post --- http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=112 Happy Pippin

hmmm cherry picked chart... lets see how you go in a ranging market

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Its just a simple trading system and it matters not if its a ranging market or a trending one, because we aren't riding trends, we're just dealing with 2 candles to make some easy gains. Simply wait for a bull candle and see if the next candle forms bullish, by say 5pips and you can enter for a 10-20pip target, stoploss at the low of the previous one. If the candle is bull and the next one isn;t forming bullish, its a no trade. Best times to trade are from european open to new york close

--- 帖子 #4 ---
do you mean - first bull(bear)?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
yes, if first bull and second not bullish . no trade &amp; if first bull and second bullish by 5pip atleast. entry at market, target 10-20pip or close of second candle, stoploss at the low of first candle.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
dear tony, i have read your thread,and I think your system is very simple. -anyway how long have you been trying this system on real acc? - when i should enter the position(wait until the second candle closed? -is this system suitable for any TF? thanks for the answer

--- 帖子 #7 ---
T. could you.plese, put entry /exit, tp, sl on the chart - 'case those "prev/next" (to which one?) gonna be confusing : )))))

--- 帖子 #8 ---
here you go myfriend.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
yes i trade this live on 50lots, mostly only trading this on usdjpy since it has a less volatility and stoploss/spread than other pair. I only recommend using this on 1hour chart and trading only from european to new york session, because we need a market that moves to profit and not a sleepy market with small candles. In my broker fxdd, from 9:00 to 24:00 , thats 15 hours and 15 candles per day to trade. This system is just pure price action, if buyers pushed the price up in the past hour, its more likely buyers will push the price up again on the next hour, vice versa for sellers.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
going with gap direction - very likely you will be within TP range even if next bar later turnes opposite ...

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Ok you mean enter about 5 pips from close of the previous bull or bear, that s it ? Thanks Tony Luk

--- 帖子 #12 ---
if you want 99% win ratio, go with 10pip tp. if you want 80% win ratio, go with 20pip tp. anyways tp at close of second candle sometimes very rewarding, usually at start of London and new York sessions and news hours.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Heres an indicator to help you with that , with alerts. Thanks to Cja.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I have some doubt

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Here's two trades i took yesterday in mid London session. Another example of how price action works best always.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
thx for the answer . anyway.must we enter position when the second candle just appear or wait for several minutes ? -how long have you been using this system? thanks for sharing mr tony

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Wait for the second candle to go up by 5 pips at least. Here's a live trade Ive just taken for almost 20 pips again.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Live account USD ?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hi, that is a very simply system. i notice that the candle before 1st candle is always the opposite direction. i.e. 0th candle - bear candle 1st candle - bull candle 2nd candle- bull (5 pips) and then buy close at the end of 2nd candle or 10/20 pips stop loss 0th candle low any one can make a EA to test it out? happy trading

--- 帖子 #20 ---
u don't wanna see an EA for this becoz it will ruin the party.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Are you waiting for the next candle to break the high, low or just the close of the previous candle?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
i think the condition for the trade is. Previous candle bull candle, current candle move +5 pips u buy with TP 10/20 SL previous candle low Previous candle bear candle, current candle move -5 pips u sell with TP 10/20 SL previous candle high

--- 帖子 #23 ---
dear all, do you have candle clock that suit for mt4 ?so we could know how many minutes the next candle will appear. and bravo tony

--- 帖子 #24 ---
i think this thread will end when somebody make an EA and discover that the equity goes down hill in a run long. So no EA please. At least let this thread stay alive for 24 hours. I might be wrong , let see how this goes.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
here u go buddy, i think many will need this too.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
alright guys I'm betting real money on this. Trading USDJPY , looks like gonna be a long trade , let see how it goes. I'm taking my bet for 0700 GMT+0 candle

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Dude i understand your skepticism, Let me tell you something. Tell me whats better? 1. a dozen of lagging and lieing indicators and a system that keeps you exposed into the market (more exposure more risk) to make a 100 pips on speculation of prices. or 2. A system thats just price action and that can give u a 80-90% chance of earning 10-20 pips in just an hour or less of exposure into the market. ---- If you browse through the hourly chart and you will notice 8/10 times after a bull candle forms the next candle forms into a bull and vice versa for a bear candles. If you see a bull candle, u see the next candle forming into a bull right in front of your eyes and you also see its gone 5pips from the close of the first candle.... Thats like the highest bet you can take for making some kind of immediate gain from the market, like 10-20 easy pips. I bet you that everyone will agree that theres no mechanical system on earth that can profit in the longrun with low risks, simply because the market doesn't move mechanically. Theres no way to know which way the price will head next.. it could go up it could go down. I just use this strategy to make my 20-40 pips daily, If you use about 10% of your account and bank on 20-40pips daily, thats a 2-4% daily gain and in 20 trading days a month thats a 40-80% easy gains, isn't it? When you speak of EA, its like your trying to make all the pips of the market and a automated system that will over trade the market mechanically on your behalf. It doesn't work that way, because 50% is the traders system and 50% is the traders instincts and his plans of what he wants from the market, that will eventually decide what is profitable in the long term.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
ths tony,i think that clock help much for us. now i'm trying your system on EU,GU, hope it will work too.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
i agree...trading is only about probability.....good job Tony! and EA is only tools to make an observation ...did my system has good probability....

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thanks for starting this interesting thread... certainly looks as if there is some basis despite the septicism... i will be following this on a demo account... so far on jpy/usd it did pick up about 20 pips

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Guys , I'm in.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
hi tony, i have more question: -is this system works on ranging market/sideways too?thx

--- 帖子 #33 ---
??

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Interesting system Tony. One question: You place the SL on the other side of the first candle and go for 10-20 pips, what is the typical (or average) risk:reward ratio here?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Tony has already answer this question ! Luk

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Tony Bro, Good to hear from you dude.Nice thread.Keep up the good work.It is more importantly to achieve a 100% guaranteed 20 pips rather than 5% on 100pips. I choose the former. Brunei Nimrod. Respect and Salute.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I have opened a dedicated usdjpy discussion here. Please feel free and your analytics are welcomed. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=172342 went long at 95.99 closed at 95.24 . 25pips gain. Just need to dig out another 20 pips and call it a day.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
the next hour is coming , i should close the trade when new candle form if neither TP nor SL is hit ?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Exit.on the hour is the way I read it. My entry ,inc. spread was 96.20

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hey tony, I think you have a very simple system thanks very much for sharing it for everyone's benefit its very kind of you I just want to ask if you make 20-40 pips a day that is indeed 2-4% gain a day but what if you lose? It appears to me the system has a reward:risk of much below one, because sometimes on the hourlies the candle formed is 60 pips so you stop would be at the low of the candle so basically you're risking 60 pips to make 10 or 20 which means you could lose 6%- 12% or more of your account on a single trade. Is my understanding correct? Also if it is how do you handle losers do u wait till your stop is hit or do you close the trade once it goes say 20 pips against you thanks

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi, The stoploss is just for protection purposes, in event the market suddenly turns a 100 pip against you, you could exit off with a limited loss. Ideally you should exit if the price moves 5-10 pips against you and accept the tiny loss instead of a big one. There are many more opportunities that will arrive again, so you can try again. The old saying, cut off the losers and let run the winners. Remember its a 2 candle strategy and not a 3-4-6-8 candle strategy, but if you feel it could trend more, its best to break even the trade to allow it to run for more.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Nice , i just made $207 on my live account. I close the trade due to new candle.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Losses are between 5-10 pips? So basically the r:r is 1:1 to 1:2. Why aren't you using a SL of 5-10 pips right away instead of first using another SL?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
becoz this system will lose if the SL is small. Discretion is the key to make it work.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hey i have something to help you guys with price action on the minutely scale, just to keep you alert about whats happening inside the 1hour candle. copy .mq4 to experts/indicators folder extract and copy .tpl to templates folder restart metatrader and load the template "twocandlesystem_m1monitor" Load it on a 1minute chart. Should look like the image attached.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
so this system is not so simple after all , more indicators coming up ?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
He said he closes the trade if it goes 5-10 pips against him, care to explain what you mean by " this system will lose if the SL is small "?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
if u scroll back to look at USDJPY chart u know will what i mean. If we trade usdjpy with a spread of 2 pips , it means 3 - 8 pips against him. The moment he open a trade it's already 2 pips against him.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
This system reminds me of the Rumpled One.Concentrate on the hour candle and focused on psychological level.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I'm not following you and I'm not gonna clutter up this thread with this either as it really doesnt matter. All I understand is what Tony has written: the initial SL is there for protection and should be on the other side of the candle, if price moves against you 5-10 pips you close the trade for a small loss, and you shoot for 10-20 pips.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Let say he close the trade when 5-10 pips against him. With the above statement posted by tony , we have a holy grail here isn't it ? 99% winning ratio with TP 10. so it's like 1:1 RR with 99% winning ratio.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hey, have a look at the image. In that you can see a color coded system that shows the price action on a minute-by-minute basis, so you can know how good the trade is currently. You can also see the hourly candle inside the 1minute chart and i have installed an indicator where you can see horizontal levels 20pips away from each other which you can use for ideal take profit levels n stuff. More information is more money isn't it

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I'll write an EA for this to test but before I do, do you only trade USDJPY or other pairs as well (I think hourly setup would be different on other pairs)?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Great ! Now we can see if we can get 99% win ratio with TP 10 and 80% win ratio with TP 20. Also not forgetting to close the trade when price 5-10 pips against us.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Tony, thanks. Does the price action often (what percentage of the time?) go back against the first candle quite a bit during the hour (quite a bit, even most of the hour?)...and then come back in the first candle's direction later in the hour, and then close in the happy direction? Would you discuss this just a bit, to give us a sense of the "guts" it may sometimes take to stay in the trade? Ron

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I trade only the usdjpy mostly with this, sometimes eurjpy. Haven't tried it on other pairs since their too volatile and would move 20-30 pip against me many times, which is too risky for me.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
i suggest the TP to be 20 and when price is +10 pips we move to break. That way , we get break even 99% of the time and our RR is 2:1. Sounds great isnt it ?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Lets take an example. candle 1 is a bear, candle 2 is a bull... so we wait to see if candle 3 forms into a bull by 5pips. Then we enter the trade and it should start moving rightaway, if it doesn't and starts to move 5-10 pips against you, thats a alert that you may need to exit the trade since its not moving that well. Vice versa for bear, candle 0 must be a bull, candle 1 must be a bear and we wait for candle 3 to form into a bearish by 5pips to enter. Remember i trade usdjpy, which has a daily range of about 80-100 pips on average. so 10 pips is quite a lot on that pair and it usually takes 30-40 mins to move 10-20 pips, unlike gbpusd or eurusd that does 30-50pip in a average hour candle. Please consider my system and high probability bet to make some quick pips, its not that i havent lost bets, but from experience i make sure strictly that my losers are less and small and make sure the winners are more and big. As ive said before the best bear and bull candles are ones that have little to no wicks before turning bearish of bullish, that indicates a strong buying or selling. hope this helps

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Ok Folks, I think every things explained and its quite simple. Ill have to leave to hunt down another 20 pips, call it a day and pour some fine whiskey for another happy trading day. Wish you all the best of the best, Sharing is caring and happy pipping YO! cya later, Tony

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thank you for sharing Tony! Just wondering if (when you have the time) you could post some charts and show which setups that you would take and which you wouldn't take based on the look and shape of the candles.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
How is it going dude? Any good news? When u have time come online to chat for a while!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
A good short set up coming up 10:00 GMT+0 on usdjpy

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I think we have to work whit this trade off: 1. Trade with high % winning trades but a bad rawal (average win / average loss) placing large stop losses 2. Trade with low % winning trades but good rawal placing small stop losses. A solution could be to settle the stop and then calculate the target profit as: stop loss*Ratio (for instance 1.5). In this way I will obtain a system with a good rawal and a stop that is not to small.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Guess what ? This system has both install for you. According to tony, TP of 20 gives about 80% winning rate. Also, tony mention that we have to close the trade if it's 5 - 10 pips against us. With TP of 20 and SL of 5-10, we have both 80% chance of winning and a 2:1 RR. Fantastic isn't it ? Nothing can beat that.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Not so quick... I don't think you will get a 80% winning ratio with a stop as low as 5-10pips... you'll need a minimum of 20pips sl. My suggestion on the stops: if you have a 1st candel of longer than 40 pips.. sl or exit point should be half the distance. good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I agree. The stop is too tight to obtain 80% winning ratio.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I have just read the thread twice (short threads are great to get the gist of) and I have to say that the simplicity of this system could make it successful Far to many of you are asking questions that have been answered. In comparison to alot of threads that involve rediculous indicators and rules to trade, this could be read, understood and traded by a teenager. Re read the thread until you a perfectly clear on how it works Then try it for a while. It is a simple hour by hour trade that requires nothing more than a candle followed by another candle. If it is in the right direction trade, if not dont trade, if your not comfortable with it, get a cup of coffee, put your feet up and relax. Far to many of you want answers before your prepared to look for them. The answers are on the first few pages. Nice work BTW

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Whilst the SL is a little tight, it does also allow a trader to get better R/R returns. Im not going to pretend I trade this method, I just like it for its simplicity, however I trade IBs. Some of the best IBs (Inside Bars) have had a pip range of 8-16 pips. Sure there are times you get stopped out, thats part of trading, however the chances to run 1:1 are greater giving you choices to take partial profits and allow trades to run. Whether traders adopt some of there own thinking to these simple methods is up to them. So in that case if your SL is tight, sure 80% may be a bit rich, you wont know till youve tried it, but how you manage your trade is the key. Win rate is only relative in situations where traders only take 1:1 or 1:2 R/R, if traders have patience and do string some 1:5s or better, then a lower Win rate can still equate to Positive growth.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
TD, Follow up question to this example. So we take a loss of say 10 pips. Then the price starting to go back into bull territory by 5 pips again beyond the previous candle, do we enter again? Or just wait for the next set up?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
If the stop is tight I think it's better to enter again.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi all. new trader so be gentle, was just wondering would Helkin-Ashi candles be better for taking a trade off.. All the best from Ireland.. Danny.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Is there any indi to spot 2 different candle colors like with sound? i mean it forms a bull and a bear candle and it beeps and vice versa so we could leave the pc and come when it beeps...

--- 帖子 #73 ---
hi, we have a bull candle and the next candle moved up 5 pips. Does that mean we have an entry to go long?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Here is USDJPY with very simple rules and h1 (please confirm if I understood the first post correctly) I don't have long m1 data for usdjpy so this is not as reliable as it should be. Bull candle: previous candle must be a "good" bull candle, open is at lower 25% of the candle and close is at upper 25% of the candle. Vice versa for bear candles. I enter at new bar open + (- for shorts) 10 pips (with buy/sell stop) and target 20 pips (with tp). Stop loss is always at previous candle low. Note that I don't use any indicators here, just the rules from the first post. H1 Curve below:

--- 帖子 #75 ---
This version closes at the end of next candle Note that this data is from short period (begin of 2008 to today) and therefore could be statistically irrelevant. Every trade is set to 2% risk.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
For me the rules were for long: -down candle -then up candle (without 25% rule) -next candle we enter if it goes up too so we try to trade swings

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The point of 25% rule was to target the "best" bull candles to see if there is potential in the "best" setups of this system. Here are the results for the above rules (down candle, up candle, stop at +-5 from open and 20 pips tp) If a tp is not hit during the candle, position is closed at the next candle open.

Everything readymade boss

what u trying to prove? The man said no Ea's just use your wisdom

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Razor you have to understand simple doesn't necessarily mean long term profitable. Sure its simple and its very large hearted of Tony to post it and yes I assume he's been profitable with it thats why he's posting it but for how long has he been trading it? To even consider trading a system its very important to back test to see how its done in the past more importantly the immediate past. How do you know its not a lucky streak? I agree that far too many people want answers before they are prepared to look for them but unfortunately none of the answers we want are on the first few pages as the method hasn't been traded long term by tony. I'm just trying to say simple doesn't necessarily mean long term profitable. It has to be tested and even though I know its subjective. How can you say "simplicity of this sytem could make it successful" as far as I know there's no relationship between simplicity and success in the trading world. Complicated systems like fuzzy logic and neuroshell systems can be just as successful as simple breakout ones.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Note that I don't claim that this system is unprofitable. The curves only show what results simple rules that I specified in my posts [I might even have misunderstood something] give. With discretion this system could very well be profitable.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
tony...... do you need to wait for another opposite candle after you tp on second candle or just use second candle as first candle on next set up? hope i explain that ok.... thanks

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Its just common sense myfriend, if buyers or sellers pushed a candle and the next candle starts to form bearish or bullish due to the previous buy/sell pressure, so you take a trade to make some instant 10-20pip gain. After that you need to either break even if you haven't taken profit due to a chance that a 3rd candle will go in your direction or wait for an opposite candle and a new setup from there.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Heres the thing. People want systems that have long term, utimate profitability and very little loss over long periods. NOTHING will guarentee that, NOTHING has a long term, 100% always positive profit. You could have a very very good year, or 2 or 3 but you can bet that you will also have some lean years. Traders fail because they cannot compute this, they never want to loose, only ever want to win. This is why when you look back on the 95% of people on this forum you can guarentee that there posts are all over the place asking the same questions. WHY? Because they are looking for the HG and the 100% win rate that doubles, triples accounts over a short period. It aint going to happen. The strategys, Methods, Systems that promise this fall down big time in the end. You have great solid returns, dont understand it ultimatly and watch your account go bye bye when multiple trades dont work. Simple systems have a great chance at working because people can follow them easily, therefore identify setups during backtesting and being able to implement with ease during the now trading. Whilst I understand backtesting it is not a sure thing for something in the future and too much emphasis is placed on the success of backtesting, or the failure. If people trialled it on a demo they would get to know first hand whether a setup like this is good for them. Simple is simple. If your a trader that would prefer Stocastics, RSI, 14 different Moving averages, Bollinger Bands, TL, S/R with Gann fans and FIBs then tie that in with rediculous rules to define when to trade and not, then hey knock yourself out. BIG players trade simpler, they dont have time to play games with lagging indicators. Some of the charts and setups I have read about are more difficult to comprehend than the Bible (no offense). You cannot talk of future profit without first knowing the future, regardless of the system, and if your afraid of long term profitability then this is not the arena for you. People who are this way need to get a full time job and that is it (I still work full time job but not because I dont understand how things work). IF your sole goal is to find something that has is going to work in all weather then your kidding yourself. Traders understand drawdown periods, traders also understand that chopping and changing when things dont work out will usually lead down that darker path. This is a random arena, and despite the know how and rules, alot of the time the market does its random thing. BTW this is a reply to an overall thread not to your personally. Your points are valid, I just thought I would add information that has been posted for Eons yet few people are prepared to acknowledge Razor

There we go. As i said earlier EA will ruin the party.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Guys to recap.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Wouldn't it be nice if someone discovered a method that back tested 100% profitable since the beginning of time? And they shared it with us. Of course some would ask what about next month, next year. Will it still be profitable then? Can it be counted on in real time? I might have to do some work. Some thinking. Wouldn't it be nice if all one had to do is push a button once and live happily ever after on the profits of that task?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hey whats up, i will be demoing this for a few days to see how it goes. Right now i am in a demo trade on UJ here are the details: UJ: Short | Lower entry target: 96.11 | SL: 96.21 | TP: 96.01 | Spread:3 I will post a picture with the trade and future trades i do tomorrow. Lets see how it goes. Will update on status. Update: I am still in the signal. A new h1 bar has just opened. I went all the way to +6. The signal bar closed at -2 for me so i am now waiting to see what the next bar will do. 2nd Update: Well its 12am here in new york(EST) and a new bar just poped up and i am at -5. I went all the way down to +5. Now the last bar was a little doji so i dunno what to do. Since my stop is only -10 i will let it ride to see what happends.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
so tony, could you tell us how long have you trying this system?, so people don't think when it's work,it just a lucky streak. thx for sharing

--- 帖子 #90 ---
timing is also very important (can we run ea and check by sessions ?) p.s. beauty of simple systems - it can be applied or separately or along with other systems (methods)...

--- 帖子 #91 ---
nice 70pips

out with 75 and 50 done for now

out with 50 and 25

--- 帖子 #97 ---
yes with discretion and if it suites the PA like today on UC when the TL was already about to break I had a couple of trades with small pos yesterday and came out all in all positiv. A got idee is to watch the M1 and see how the trade is develloping maybee using a trailing stop as soon as trade is in profit and things like that. U can not do this with an EA so the backtesting with EA is not very usefull.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
+10

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thanks Tony for the great thread. Its a break out to take small pips profit or small pips loss. To my understanding you use usd/jpy because of small spreads and a low market. I am on track with you. I like to do things mechanical and simple. That's why i like the system. Have you thought about eur/usd, gbp/usd. Just asking a question not to get off track. Looking back the last week, they had some nice pops. Profitable. I understand we start at Londons open. Do we go through until the US closes or, at the end of the London session? Made 75 pips today. done for the day.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
HI smurf, You know, the answers to your questions are in the first few pages of the thread. Not too difficult to get your answers and not ask for repetition by Tony or others. Tony gave the hours he trades, and why he favors the USDJPY (and sometimes EURJPY) and *why not* the pairs you mention... Come on folks, spare Tony and us all, and so you don't look foolish: read the thread. Smurf, how about you read through the thread and compile a document of essentials (cut and paste) ? It would help you be sure for yourself, and you would provide it for others who ask without reading the thread. How about it? (no insult intended) Ron

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi Great...sick of all the lagging indicators .....I just added the attached candle recognition master indi....helps a bit with the decision making. Thanks to the creator of this thread. Re the indi: When you attach it to your MT4 chart each candle that represents some candlestick pattern will be marked with the symbol. A legend for the symbols is located in the top left corner of the chart and you can easily find out which patter is represented by the specific symbol. Now, all you have to do is to buy after the strong bullish patterns and sell on the strong bearish patterns.

I am looking forward to learning price action. This is a simple method I just have to slowly learn it. I look forward too it.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Its not just that some people doubt it could work, its just that the mind cannot comprehend the simplicity of it and interpret possible results. Too many traders shun the simple methods (probably because they also believe if its too good to be true yadda yadda) and go with the complex, rack your brains, fill your charts methods that are posted everywhere. Im not a fan of stating the profitability of a method before the method gets off the ground. For some reason people see this and they need hard results without devoting anytime to trialling it themselves. There are plenty of threads on here that claim high returns and the same thing happens, traders cut it down with questions and criticism before even reading and trialling the method. In some cases it is a good thing (protecting noob traders from the destruction of following a thread that promises rediculous results) however it is still ultimatly up to the individual to pick and choose and today there are more demo platforms opening daily so you can give a method a good trial before deciding to put the money on the table. So far this thread is starting to develope with some people taking active involvement. Time the mother of all will tell how successful this method can be. Razor

No i don't feel insulted. I just asked a question. I have read these 7 pages over and over. Well i withdraw the question without an Understanding. We all learn on different levels. Thanks anyway.

In first page it just mentioned up until new york session. I have looked at post9,28,48,45,48,50,58,74,88. i tells me about the low spread market slow wich tell a lot but do you trade upto or thru the new york session. People are going through the session. Thanks anyway.

Having some good fun here =-] 3 trades 3 winners profit of 30pips I don't think a lot of people are seeing the potential of this system cause its so easy and they probably think there is no way it can actually be this easy. So 1st day of really demoing this and i have 5 orders that were all winners. Will keep demoing. =-]

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Ok looks like we might have a new order coming. Price of Prev bar Low: 96.72 Short entry at: 96.67 Set Tp: 96.57 +10 Set SL: Will watch how it goes lol But i'll set a hard SL at 96.89(High of prev candle) Lets see how it goes guys =-]

hi all.... i must have the monkey on my back or something....i had 10 trades..... lost 5 and won 5 but my losses were with more pips. maybe i am having trouble picking out the correct candles (i am a newbie and u would think anyone could pick out a candle but.....) i will continue though and study study....thanks for all of your help!!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
this system is very simple. i using that 3 month already. But i not take all two candle for entry. I'm using certain time only and entry follow to 5m tf for comfirmation. Min tp 50 pips.

S..... could you explain a little more.....don't quite understand....thanks..

Folks, My strong suggestion is to trade only after 7GMT and max around 20GMT. Enter the market with a certain goal in mind, like 20-40pips or whatever you need, then stop trading. Not trading in right sessions, over trading and not having a goal n plan is not good for the health of a trader. For newbie, just practice on a demo. trade with no more than 10% of your demo money, target 20-40pips per day, thats 2-4% gains per day and 40-80% profit per month. Just imagine if you had a 100,000$ account and you make 40-80% of that per month, thats a killing 40-80k per months!! I have researched a good filter to prevent taking trades on consolidating candles. Here is the filter - 1, add a 5 period smoothed moving average following HIGH prices. 2, add a 5 period smoothed moving average following LOW prices. If the candles are inside of the moving averages, you might not want to consider trading &amp; if the candle breaks out of the moving averages you might consider wanting to trade the next candle. Additionally, you might want to also use a 1minute chart to monitor price action on the minutely scale to see how good the trade is and for alert if the trade is going against you. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...5&amp;postcount=45 Wish you all Happy pipping! Please find all the answers to your quessy's by reading through the posts. Cya laters, Tony

Hope this helps, and i also hope that i am right lol. If i am wrong please tell me so i can change the way i trade this. That last pending short is now closed cause of the new long bar. Im going to sleep so i'll have a look and see what to do tomorrow. Gnite happy trading

Hy guys ! I was a silent "watcher" of this thread and I think this is a real interesting approach. first time when I sow those FX charts I said: "Hei ... thouse candles are walking two by two" At that time I didn't know anything about any system or paterns or indicators, PA, Fibo, R/S etc. LOL Now I know a few things, but I realised that I have allot to learn. So Tony had the guts to make a thread on this subject and I am verry thankfull to him, couse it reminds me of what I sow my first time when I read about FX. Thx Tony ! Now about your (Dv84) post, it seems to me that you are waiting that the tradable bar to get over/under the high/low of the signal candle with 5 pips and then you are getting your profit. It is an interesting approach too. Also I sow that if a bar has given to you a profit you will not use the next bar as a signal bar for an eventual trade (if I am wrong please corect me) I just want to ask you, why did you entered your rule number2 ? What is the base for this rule ? Don't get me wrong, I just want to see the reason, not to criticise. It seems to me that from 8 trades you had 7 winers ! It looks good to me Thx Dv84, And ... Have pips !

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Whilst I am with you so far on the simplicity of the concept, best not to warp the imaginations of people by this post. Imagination and reality are 2 separate concepts, imagining things such as making 80K a month is not realistic unless you account allows it (it would have be much larger the 100K) If you were able to double a 100K account in a year that would be fantastic. And 10% of an account on any trade will lead to emotional killing when you string 3 or more loosers together. A more rational approach, at 100K at least would be 2.5-3%. Rome wasnt built in a day which is why so much of it still stand today. Trade safely and for the longevity of it, not risk more than you need to.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
--------- smurf, looking good! ... like you are finding your answers. But what does "different levels of learning" have to do with plain written posts there in black and white (again, no offense. Just to help 'get to it')? Tony, in post #9 as you already read: "...mostly only trading this on usdjpy since it has a less volatility and stoploss/spread than other pair. I only recommend using this on 1hour chart and trading only from european to [probably Tony should have said "through" NY session] new york session, because we need a market that moves to profit and not a sleepy market with small candles. In my broker fxdd, from 9:00 to 24:00 , thats 15 hours and 15 candles per day to trade. [Ron: 2 AM - 5 PM Eastern. That is "through" New York session. However, some folks *might* say the first 4 hours of each session (generally) is good enough.] This system is just pure price action, if buyers pushed the price up in the past hour, its more likely buyers will push the price up again on the next hour, vice versa for sellers. However Tony says in more recent post about times to trade from 7 GMT - max of 20 GMT...I believe that is about 2 AM - 3 PM Eastern...is that about right? 2 hours shy of end of NY session? Hope this helps &amp; not hinders. Ron

Your EA is not functioning correctly, you are only achieving a 46% accuracy, any thing less than 85% is pointless for backtesting, irrelevant of the availability of the data, i have data that goes back to 2005, when you get it running smoothly, i can run it through if you'd like.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
G'day mate you do like your breakout methods don't you, i too agree with you that this system just need time to prove itself, the thinking behind it is solid If the buyers are buying then get with the sheep and buy If the sellers are selling then get with the sheep and sel BUT DON'T GET GREEDY take only a little at a time I tried a MA EA that had a tp of 10pips Broke even so i dropped the idea but this idea is more re-actional to the situation, rather than a lagging MA I see no reason for it not to work - look at the charts and forward test in demo I say I do agree that thoughs testing this should not trade real or above 2% risk, learn it first get confident then gradually move up if you must best of pips all

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi MPP LOL i love em. I did take 2 trades on this system, but added my little swing to it by having TP at 1:1 for half my position and let the other half run. Same set up that I use for my IB trades in my journal. Both got a little steam before coming back and knocking me out. What I look for is bigger R/R and this method suits that to a T because the small risk means small movement to 1:1, after that its a free ride. Some candles today which I missed (looking at my own system 99% of the time) ran extremely nicely, in some cases ran passed 5:1 R/R. The ultimate benefit could be what I look for an that is a trade that runs for much longer and yields a much greater R/R. It is possible to let your winners run longer than 20 pips if some are prepared, but that is not part of this method so I dont want to take away the core which is outlined in the first few post. Take care Razor

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Sorry tony_dtrader, I just want to add something about the 'being greedy' part (MPP). Just adding that aiming for more pips on a single trade is smart business. Greedy can be alot of things (I know this is not what your referring to MPP bud) but letting some winners run past X point can do wonders for your equity curve and your account balance. I trade the more volitile pair of GBP/USD especially during the London/New york cross. It offers good moves, and if you get a small risk candle you can maximise your potential by letting it run. How you do that is up to you. You could move your SL to +5 after say 20 pips, and if you weather the storm you could make greater pips. I post a pic of the GBP to show you what I mean. By doing this you can also alleviate the amount of time spent at your screen. If this is stepping over the boundaries tony_dtrader just let me know and Ill remove this post (dont want to step on toes of someone elses methods) Take care Razor

hi mikkom, my idee about the 25%rule: i personally like the 50% fibo retracement very much and if the retracement from the extrem of the 1. candle (this includes the wick) is less than 50% for me it is a 1-2-3 Breakout trade and thats good PA i show u and example from yesterday

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Just looking at the new threads I came upon Tony_ dtrader and his simple method. I made a chart of all the entries I saw using his 1m template. The 7 entries today made 20 pips each depending if you could patiently hold two of them over an hour. One of those had 14 pips drawdown which is a loss for some folks. The other 5 paid within the hour. Seems a 10 pip stop, b/e at +10 with a 10 pip trailing stop might be a good money management plan. Just my opinion from initial observation. Anyhow, an easy 80+ pips during the time I trade today near New York timezone. Thanks for an interesting simple concept. Steve

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Also Stevewise neither of these methods are what i conside to be greedy, they are controlled methods of trade management, the greed comes in when poeple start trying aim for 100pips each time, suddenly there in massive drawdowns even with a small SL position - WHY, well because the system looks to me to be geared towards trading the momentum factor and has no bearing on the actual trend - so aim to high and it will kick you good and hard TP 1 half at position X and letting the rest run and trailing it wll take some control but seem to me to be an excellent option, a simple low MA (ie 5) would i expect easily increase the odds of far higher gains on the second position But for now lets let Tony teach his way, after all he may have tried all these ideas.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
here is AFL (Amibroker Formula Language) Code : The bodyfactor argument controls the minimum accepted size of candle's body as a fraction of high-low range. The rangefactor argument controls the minimum accepted size of candle's body compared to 15-bar simple moving average of |close-open| range. Inserted Code bodyfactor = param("BF", 20, 10 , 90, 20)/100; rangefactor = param("RF", 100, 100 , 200, 20)/100; Buy = CdWhite(bodyfactor,rangefactor ); Short = CdBlack(bodyfactor,rangefactor); Sell = Cover = 0; //PositionScore = 100 * mtRandomA(); SetChartOptions( 0, chartShowDates | chartShowArrows ); Plot( C, "", colorWhite, styleBar ); PlotShapes( Buy* shapeSmallUpTriangle, colorGreen, 0, L ); PlotShapes( Short* shapeSmallDownTriangle, colorRed, 0, H ); /* Backtester Settings*/ SetOption( "initialequity", 100 ); SetOption( "FuturesMode" , 1); SetOption( "ActivateStopsImmediately", 0 ); SetOption( "Allowsamebarexit", 0 ); SetOption( "PriceBoundChecking", 0 ); SetBacktestMode(backtestRegular); PointValue = 1; MarginDeposit = -2; /* Exit*/ stp = 1.5* ATR(10); tKp = 0.2*ATR(10); ApplyStop( stopTypeLoss, stopModePoint, stp, 1 ); ApplyStop( stopTypeProfit, stopModePoint , tKp, 1 ); SetPositionSize( 5 , spsPercentOfEquity );

Hi tony,how do i get the template for 1hr candle setting? Great work keep it up!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
hi great thread will be following all the way keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Spot on, that is why I have respect for you. The setting of unrealistic goals (100 pips in a market of currencies may not seem like much) forces traders to spend far to long looking, monitoring and adjusting there trades. When you start to set goals, you start to chase your tail, by that I mean if 100 pips a day is your goal and you have 2 lossers for 20 pips each, suddenly your goal is 140 so you ultimatly sit there are rack out trades trying to make up for the loss. Let the market do as it will. It is simply an opportunity flow. Some days you will make nothing, others you will make up for it. You need to understand trading as a business, not a day job. If you look at each day as a day where you have to make money then you are going to stress yourself to a point of exhaustion. Thanks MPP Razor

--- 帖子 #131 ---
And looking at your chart the first thing I will do is revert back to a previous comment about being able to withstand the small pullbacks, get to 1:1 and let the trade run. The first trade would have still being running (pending further charts) which was over 100 pips on your first trade, and all you where looking for was 1:1 or there abouts and letting the trade do its thing. The other point I make is that after that first trade went 1:1 and you took some profit, it would have freed up some margin and you could have added some more along the way if you chose. None of this is considered greed. All you are doing is taking the options that the market is giving you to maximise your account growth. You could quite easily stop at the first trade and see how it pans out. Positive pips is positive growth. Take care all, have a good weekend Razor

nice toy - ccshift - custom tfs (120, 480, etc), also - can be run on tester

--- 帖子 #133 ---
can you paste the body factor and range factor parameter options (what the options are) from your amibroker BF and RF funtion library help file? So we can understand better. Also am I correct in assuming your stop is 7 times your take profit. also what does positionscore mean?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
do you use stop orders and add spread to that so for Uj it would be 5+1? Thanks Steve

bodyfactor and rangefactor are the arguments for the candlestick functions generated by AB candlesitck functions plugin (candle.dll). All functions have "Cd" prefix appended to avoid name conflicts with built-in functions. CdWhite( bodyfactor = 0.4, rangefactor = 0) - returns True (1) when white candle appears, False (0) otherwise. CdBigWhite( bodyfactor = 0.9, rangefactor = 1.5) - returns True (1) when a big white candle appears, False (0) otherwise. CdBlack( bodyfactor = 0.4, rangefactor = 0) - returns True (1) when black candle appears, False (0) otherwise. CdBigBlack( bodyfactor = 0.9, rangefactor = 1.5) - returns True (1) when a big black candle appears, False (0) otherwise. CdDoji( threshold = 0.05 ) - returns True (1) when doji is detected, False (0) otherwise. The threshold argument defines maximum allowed difference between open and close as a fraction of high-low range. CdHammer( rangefactor= 1.1 ) - returns True (1) when hammer is detected, False (0) otherwise. This function checks if Close is higher than half the distance between high and low and the candle is black. In addition to that the body size of the candle must be greater rangefactor * average |close-open| range from 15 bars, and open has to be located not lower than 10% of candle height from the high price. CdBearishEngulfing( bodyfactor = 0.4, rangefactor = 0.5) returns True (1) when Bearish engulfing pattern is detected, False (0) otherwise. CdBullishEngulfing( bodyfactor = 0.4, rangefactor = 0.5) returns True (1) when Bullish engulfing pattern is detected, False (0) otherwise. bodyfactor = ( close - open )/ (high-low); rangefactor = (close - open)/ MA ( (close-open), 15); * absolute values Yes, stop loss must be greater than take profit. PositionScore = 100 * mtRandomA(); - is for picking randomly the trade signals out of the total number of generated signals for portfolio backtesting.

After a visual back test of a couple of weeks during london and ny sessions i get about a 50% success rate. It certainly didn't come close to 80% accuracy even if you were going for just 10-15 pips. This is eliminating any dojis and only trading clear bull/bear candles. Most of the time on the usd/jpy it never even gets to 20 pips profit. What does everyone else get? It doen'st look profitable to me but more of a crap shoot. Paris

--- 帖子 #137 ---
You can never get a 80% accuracy with 1:1 risk/reward and fixed sizes of stops. stops must be volatility based.

Im so glad that you have joined the fraternity of wasted posters. What do you hope to gain by making a pointless post such as this. Seriously im glad there are people like you in the commuity, its even better if your a trader because you complete disregard for time and effort gives me a smile as you enter trades probably at random. A visual backtest holds NO water any where! And a system that has a 50% win rate, even on a VISUAL backtest can be profitable depending on how you manage you R/R (Risk / Reward). So then where does that leave you? Searching for the Holy Grail no doubt, wandering from thread to thread until there is literally someone who will trade for you. Good luck Mr Liquidity, the market welcomes traders with your time and effort. Razor

--- 帖子 #139 ---
All I'm saying is i have much better systems that are much more profitable than this one. I only checked this one for the wonderful claims that the first poster made. But after reviewing the charts it didn't hold water. At least not on the usd/jpy. Haven't checked other pairs. It's black and white. Paris

Hi Tony, I just notice your thread.For the graph below, if lets say you enter a bearish -5 pips on GMT 11, it would result in a loss, due to gmt 12 is a bullish candle. So how you prevent not to ether this kind of trade? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
i already test this system. i think the system won't work in ranging market. most of the time it hits the SL than TP. I think with 1H timeframe, the 10-20 SL is too small. any response for this. I appreciate for all of the response. thx

--- 帖子 #142 ---
10-20 pips is not the SL - it's the target, the stop is at the end of the indicator candle, if the next candle fails to make the TP and turns around you have choices ie first indicator candle is long - tp 10pips on half, second half to BE if first half hit, stop at low of indicator candle ie 50pips Tp not hit candle closes bearish, but stop not hit - exit trade wait for next candle to show, this candle become a bearish (short) indicator candle next trade short tp 10pips etc stop and reverse and so on.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
i would suggest you go back and read the rules again, allowing the trades to go to 10pips tp i count 16winning trades and 3 losing trades over the 2 days trading shown in your charts assuming i tp half on the winners and let half run from BE locked in 160 pips profit on half lots - loses on 3 trades on full lot for average 20pips = 120pips equivilant lose total 40pips profit for the 2 days plus any pips gain from free runners, on just the 12:00gmt trade alone (depending on trade management plan) you could have gain 250pips if trailed using a 20sma so how did it fail - not sure how you traded it, but this is just my view please can people stop trying to destroy every new idea they see until they have at least had a run at it for a month.

about sl:

--- 帖子 #146 ---
In ranging market I usually measure the average length of bars and the longest &amp; shortest bar, so it will give me consideration to trade or not.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Tony, if sl been hit, do you entering second time on same candle?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Urm Razor you don't need to wish Paris luck she's been trading since before you came to ff and has made enormous contributions to basket trading strategies. Just because a candle has closed higher than it opened doesn't mean theres a probability of greater than 50% (if you use a 1:1) of next one also being a white candle. I can't find any statistical evidence of this happening the market doesn't know what candles are thats just our perception. I think you're the one who needs good luck because thats what it appears to boil down to. Sure you can make money with this system provided you're lucky since you only aim to trade two candles a day. Maybe you're lucky both times. But for how long?

No problems, I know there are better systems available, there are bound to be. On this Forum there must be thousands. Most systems stem from someone elses workings, are tweak and distorded over time. Few are completely unique. My reference was based on something that is all too common on trading forums, and that is imput on systems that provides little benefit to those who are taking the time to trial it. If something doesnt look good to someone then they should just bit there tongue, or make the relevant comments and move on. I have made my comments and at times used specific examples or where I feel the wording should be different (the 100K post only 2 pages back is an example). The only time something should be frowned upon heavily is when there is a genuine risk of new traders following something, or joining something that is never going to work. All in all, longevity is a key to determining success traders and is also a way of determining successful systems. Threads that gain momentum and last past 200 plus pages with a number of people enjoying success can in the end have credit in my book, regardless of how some people percieve the short or long term success of that system. I guess in time we will find out just how well this works out. Also as I have mentioned, a system doesnt need to be 50%+ to be successful. If a trader can eclipse the mental barrier of just trading for 2:1 or 1:1 then s/he can unlock a door that allows huge gains of single mediocre setups. Its rare, but possible. I trade for this, just like Joel Rensink and Peter Crowns. I trade with a small group live and we have been having great success with some traders this week making over 5:1 R/R and some cases 10:1. Sometimes the setups seem simple and therefore people associate simple results, move past this and there are ample opportunities to hold singular trades for much longer than the average. Take care, my apologies at the rashness of the previous post. Razor

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Interesting idea. However, if you look at historical data, the probabilities with hourly bars is the same as with daily bars. The chance the that the next bar is the same direction is a coin flip, with a slightly improved probability going to the expectation that the bar will go the opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Historical data - yes when you look at each bar, very few are in the same direction - nothing new there, thats not what this method looks for. look at the wicks - how many made it past entry plus 10/20pips before changing direction Momentum/round numbers/fib points/ma - most traders use these and base there trading on things like this, therefore we have wicks - why, because of the buyers/sellers targets for entry and exits, this allows price to move beyond the close of the previous bar - that's why this method has potential Richard Farleigh - taming the lion, in his book he talks about trading with the masses, when price changes by around 10% either way get on board and go with the flow - he's a dam sight richer than most and no indicators simple as that try it for a few months.

Sorry to spoil the party but this system is sure to lose all your money. It doesn't matter if in the short-term it seems to work, automate it and you'll figure this out.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
some statement... what did you figured? either support it or don't spoil the air with with b/s

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I'm sure you have something but the original poster stated 99% accuracy with just one bar. I trade a slight variation based upon reversals and inner bars for the daily timeframe. It has a 61% win/loss over 21 pairs and makes about 1000 pips a month. In live trading real money for two month I've gotten 65% win/loss and 1900 pips in two months. The only indicator is a regression slope. I started with DIBS which can not be validated in backtesting, but discovered a few things looking at historical data. An inner bar is more likely to reverse and the best days to close a position is either the third or fifth (probably similar results would hold for hourly bars). The second and fourth days have a greater chance of reversing, historically speaking. Oh ya another thing is the sanctity of an inner bar holds no relevance for the reverse. For a long position the inner bar breaking the lower bound of the outer bar has no importance. In fact a breakout from that pattern has a higher probability of success. So the thing I typically do do is look at which patterns play out with this system. Have you looked at any probabilities of wicks and their impact or is this anecdotal evidence as is provided in the start? Sorry if I came of criticizing the system but I like to start with the odds in my favor. Has anyone looked at how this would play out with a reversal of the direction in the next bar? A reversal is more likely.

I am going to make 2 more posts on this thread, and perhaps forget about my journal aswell. The problem with ALL factory threads is that there are a few people out there who are genuinly trying to succeed and then there are others who just have to come along and try to ruin the flow. The information given in any particular arena can be tossed and turned until the beliefs of a few can overwhelm the beliefs of many. In most instances the person who started a particular thread gets fed up and moves away to enjoy or lament their future. So many threads that have been started by a particular person seldom see that person actively post throughout the entire thread, in fact they can go weeks or months without posting. This leads one to think a few things. They are either enjoying there success with the orginal method or they have gone bust and dont want to show themselves for fear of looking like a failure. The second to most is probably the prominant truth. When I came along I was just genuinly interested in the simplicity of this thread. The orginal post and subsequent posts could have been tweaked slightly as the claims may not be quite as high (MY BELIEF) so I stated so, but that statement was made once. I then went on to provide some support. However, Tony may have been trading this method for years, he may have found an EDGE to this method that he perhaps doesnt want to share right now. Believe it or not (even in randomness) traders who have devoted a particular amount of time to something with usually always see more information in particular circumstances that would trigger alarms. These alarms may be a load up situation or a hold back situation. These situations, no matter how well they try to define them to others will seldom be absorbed until they have spent time trading and can see it. Very few people understand FOREX and most come along because today it is advertised like a monster on the internet. Proven methods, demo accounts with 100K leveraged a 400:1 promising money, auto traders that trade for you, the list goes on and on and ON. 4 years ago when I started trading there was much much less on the internet in ways of adverts. If you wanted to find something there was stacks of information, but you had to have some idea as to what it is you wanted. Youtube holds thousands of 'winning strategy' vids that people can watch. Very few people truly understand the risks of trading. They come along to forums, watch countless videos and try to participate without understanding. Does it take a great deal of knowledge to understand trading? Not neccesarily otherwise the uber minds of the world would be dominating this business. Why do 95% of people fail. There are a number of reasons. In most cases it is there desire to make millions out of cents in the shortest time and without devoting enough time to see if some particular thing works. That brings me back to the countless times (in all threads) where an anon person make a pointless claim that something they refuse to give anytime to will fail. How easy is it to do! It is easy for people to put in there 2c, walk away and never be seen again. Most times you can look back upon this 'posters' previous posts and find support immediatly in that they have seldom contributed to any thread more than a handful of times. Forums like these are at there core designed to be a place where people can have access to information. People come up with an idea ( currently working or in the process of) and post it. They give out the information they feel relative and other come along and give there imput. Imput is great if people understand the initial post. If they dont then they simple ask for it and in time the thread initiator will give it. These people are the constructive ones, they are looking at something, deeming it to be possible but just need to get some more pieces of the puzzle. In time most of these will give this method a go and if things work out for the better then the posts will thrive and thread will grow to a point where the information gathered will vastly outweigh the critism that rogue posters deliver. Final note: We all have the desire to succeed but desire isnt enough. Traders take years and years of hard knocks before finally putting all the pieces together. Few people have the time to withstand this. Few people have the time to read, understand and implement. I can back this up with the mountains of posters who make the rediculous claims without proof that something doesnt work. They open a thread, go straight to the last page and ask how something works, they are not prepared to go back through the pages and pages of posts to get answers to the questions that have been raised tens to hundreds of times. Some just read the opening post and make judgement. These are the same people who (if they read books at all) just read a blurb and decide that a book contains nothing useful or no great storyline. I dont normally worry myself with these people because the vast majority will not get past there first 100 trades (or less) without disaster and that will be there trading career gone in the blink of an eye. A trader, a successful trader will weather the storm. They take the hits, understand them and still move forward. These very few understand that there are great times, and there are not so great times. They understand that trading is risk and riskless trading doesnt exist. All strategies have limitations and therefore all strategies will reach points where they dont work aswell as they were. Traders know this and they can adapt. Longevity is one of the keystones of trading. The longevity to be in the game for the years to decades will mean perservering through the hard times to come out the end and go again. Successful traders can still BLOWUP, but they get back on there feet. They can be part of the 5% crowd, loss all and start again. The 95% crowd doesnt achieve the above because they cannot accept it. Some look to blame. They blame the markets for not doing what it should have done, they blame a thread starter for starting something that didnt work for THEM, they blame everyone and everything without understanding what they did. Because of the emotional pain and not being able to rationally digest it they walk away to a full time job that earns them there EXPECTED pay packet every week. I do not claim to be an uber successful trader, I do however understand everything I have written. I have been in this game for 4 years now, have placed a good number of trades, come close to blowing an account and then rebuilt it. I too at my early stages limbo'd from method to method before the spark went off in my head that what I was doing was causing the backwardness in my trading. At that point I stopped myself. I started taking a more Proactive approach to not only trading, but to understanding why I want to trade and how I could further that understanding. Ive had the AH HA moments in the shorter past that has made me a better individual trader. I am disapointed, but not at all suprised by what happens in these forums. I am glad to see that there are still many out there who are prepared to take the time to learn, understand and implement an idea to see if it is possibly credible and then start giving feedback. To the others, go on doing what you do best and provide the liquidity for those who are prepared to take the time to trade. There may be a few responses to this post and I may read them but I doubt I will take any action because the ones who respond to it in there manner will obviously taken it personally which seems to be a fundamental flaw. Take care Razor

R., open public forum - is not refined environment - always been and will be ton of trash - so what? there is idea ans there is wise or not, stupid or groundless opinions - that's the price of idea and open discussion

--- 帖子 #165 ---
RT - I can understand your not wanting to post further on this thread, but why ditch your journal, which imho is one of the best on FF and presumably is helpful to your own trading discipline ? My 2 pips on this thread is that it certainly has value, but that value is not quite as simple as the OP suggests. Claiming 80% and 99% win rates haven't helped his cause.... I think it was daytrading - always a very insightful poster - who commented recently about seeing what is always there, but what is not seen by almost everyone... (I've misquoted somewhat, but the gist is there)... Back to trading... :nerd:

Hi Fxxx, thanks for posting the blank EA , I will try and get it to work. I have been trying a different approach to the 2 bar reversal on the H1, I am looking at getting 3 or 4 to 1 RR . I have manually backtested the last 6 months and it looks very good. cheers Ian

--- 帖子 #167 ---
very nice i tried it and it works thanks

--- 帖子 #168 ---
+ 62 pips for the day. It will work if you work it. Traded in three currencies. Will try again tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hey Smurf Nice work and well done. Can I check which pairs you have been working it on ??? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I used eur/usd gbp/jpy gbp/usd. I just use rules from 4- 12. Gbp/Jpy i had to change the rules. I know I'm not suppose to, but i did. It works for me. I don't want to be rude but, please don't ask me what i changed because of the people on here will just tell you to follow the rules. I not being rude. Just conservitive.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi Fxxx, I have tried to contact you via PM , but for some reason I cant send any. Could you please PM me as I have a project you may be interested in. EDIT. I thought I had found a great method using your 2 bar reversal indicator , But in real time when the price moves into the zone the arrow appears , But if price reverses and the H1 bar closes below the open the arrows are not historically shown . i thought we had found the grail !!! Thanks Ian

--- 帖子 #172 ---
dear smurf. anyway do you use in other TF? do you mean using this rules on 4-12 GMT?thx

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I use 1 hour. 30 min for confimation on a trnd line for wich way to go. Only traded gbp/jpy today. The 7-8 candle My high was158.53 added 10 on entry order for 158.63. I got out at 158.95 for +32. I was done for the day. Im sorry i dont know gmt times. I live in tennesse. And i also use fxcm . I have some studying to do on the times again. I use trade from 4-12 est. sorry dont know gmt.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
wow. I'm loving what I see. will be running with this. fantastic find.. thanks.. I'll be back after I read the history of this thread and test drive... jiva...

--- 帖子 #175 ---
very nice. especially appreciate the indicator that allows superimposing a higher time frame candle on 1m chart. neat to see the action within the bigger candle... Fiddled around a bit with lower time frames, but the 60 m is the best. just have to be there when the hour changes to find entries. nice simple price based strategy. traded live after demo-ing for several hours. ended up breaking even. won some lost some. not the system's fault, just my newness with using it. Tomorrow.. wanna back test a bit tonight if I have some time. Thanks... not getting the idea of the hama indi though. any feedback on how to use it appreciated....does illustrate the trend nicely. is it used as a cutter? sweet spots are nice, but I find pivot points very significant... Am I missing something with the use of sweet spots? Again any feedback on the use of sweet spots, much appreciated. jiva

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Im done with 54 pips for the day.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
as all indicators - it's show closed bar signals (result); but with PA we have history - PA itself (lower tf bars) and can see what been happening from open to close Ian, - sorry, i'm not for the projects right now, i just can stick a few cents briefly- sorry; but post your ideas (here or in appropriate thread) - if people get interested, - indis, EAs tools would follow (more than you would wish for : )))))

--- 帖子 #178 ---
dear smurf. i think you have high winning percentage don't you? anyway for tony i hope you continue writing your journal about using this thread. good job tony

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hy smurf ! Just wanted to tell you that I am really sorry that this thread is not so ... active any more... but you are doing a great job here ! I think, if you can, I would like to here more about your strategy to trade with this system. I understood that you are working on different pairs and is ok for you. Can you help me with some advices ? Thx in advance ! And good luck !

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Just had to figure out what works. Today was very long. Thanks goes to the creator of this thread.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Tony...great thread....and thanks for the system...simplicity is always the best my friend....i agree with this strategy and i have made some pretty good gains...dont be greedy and this strategy WILL work great.... good thread...i would definitely say that it has helped me...

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I read somewhere that the first 15 min is where the volume is. Some people tell you on here not to change things. I agree. But i like to think outside of the box. This thread does seem kind of low today. Look at post 170, 173. Thats the way i trade it. It recommended to use slow currencies. At the end of every hour i look at the currencies and see what the high and low says at that time. I draw the trend line on the 1 hour and 30 min candles. If it is bouncing of a trend line thats how i enter. The 4 oclock candle has been the best for the last 2 days. The 8 oclock candle has also been a good time to trade. I read somewhere that the first 15 min is where the volume is. Some people tell you on here not to change things. I agree. But i like to think outside of the box. I also watch for announcements coming out. If im in a trade i always tighten up my stop loss. This is a good thread. Typing is not my thing, even though i took it in school. I wish eveyone well.

I have been following this thread for the past couple days and decided to whip up my own EA for EUR/USD, only I added a couple more indicators (AO, ADX, and PSAR). After tweaking things a bit I got excellent results - 93% profit trades and a profit factor of 11.28! Thanks Tony!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Why not post your Ea so that we too can enjoy 93% profit as you are doing. This is the essence of brotherhood.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yea right!!why don't you put the EA so we can try to 'foretest'....

--- 帖子 #188 ---
My suggestion is to make your own EA, it wasn't very hard for me to do (and by no means am I a programming expert). Adding PSAR seemed to help DRAMATICALLY! I was playing around last night and optimal trading time is from 4 AM to 3 PM EST - this leads to 90-95% profit trades. When I trade all hours it seems to get 80-85% (which leads to a shite-load of money for some months, but for a few it leads to huge losses).

--- 帖子 #189 ---
which pairs?plz

--- 帖子 #190 ---
@Danoid Then why post at all when you've already written an EA? EGO? This is a Forum for traders to share/learn. Neither of which was achieved by your post. Doesn't make sense. Waste of space and time. Silly.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Not so...I was trying to add my insights to improve the system (and to show that an EA can indeed be implemented). Every day I discover something new that improves the system, today I discovered that two EMA's with a period of 12 on high and low settings combined with the close of the previous candle improves the number of profit trades.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
in reference to the EA....I am not a programmer at all...so i used the indicator for suggested entry points..which was generously posted by tony D.....i found that to be useful....i would like to see Danoid's EA.... congrats to you for making an EA that shows that kind of promise....I will agree that this is for learning and sharing information...any insite on how you developed it would be great... regards

--- 帖子 #193 ---
hiD, how do you mean it's combined? thankyou

--- 帖子 #194 ---
ave amplitude, ranges

--- 帖子 #195 ---
tony dtrader nice and simple system every newbie shud give try to it... less complication=high confidence=better results.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
have done some demo but can't seem to catch a winning trade. when I look back at the charts, I see, okay there was a trade, but at the time I'm not catching it. theory seems sound... but actually working the system is a little allusive for me... Just check every hour for a set up as the new candle is forming on the 1hr? that's it? thanks..

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Yeah thats it u shud just look at the 1hr chart candles...but what i would like to add on is trend indicator. Tudorgirl indicator can work on this strategy as well. RED GO SHORT WITH NEW CANDLE,BLUE GO LONG WITH NEW CANDLE.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Look to see if the close of the previous candle is above/below the 12 high/low EMA. What I found was that the EA worked best for the month of March. I think the reason why is because there was very little volatility during that month (this is when all the stock markets bottomed out). I tried fooling around with a volatility based indicator - the standard deviation envelope, but it didn't lead to any improvement. Then I played around with Tony's high/low MA idea by optimizing and the 12 high/low EMA worked best. What I need is a volatility based indicator that is normalized. Something like ATR (only that indicator isn't normalized).

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Let me rephrase that - I need a way of normalizing the ATR (since a non-native indicator will take a long time to optimize).

--- 帖子 #200 ---
here's universal normalizer ind. type-in exact ind filename, you want to normalize, param, ind. middle level - go like: atr, 14, 0,0,0, midlevel- 0.007 macd, 12,26,9, mid:0; rsi:14,0,0,50 etc

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Wowzers, thanks fxxx! It's strange how the ATR indicator looks like it goes above and below the maximum and minimum values.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
could be something - good luck ma12 hi lo - not sure, looks like gives hard time on range may be together with atr?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I had some pretty good gains today...was down yesterday, but not the systems fault i over played the fundamentals...system is simple and works,.. Great stuff

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Thats good to hear pipinator. I'm about to test this system on my live account today. I love the idea of only trading on 1 hour bar breakouts. What has everybody else's results been like using this system? Please share your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
something i have been using is tony d's indicator as well as stochastic set at 8 3 3....seems to be working with decision making.....if you cannot set stochastic to 8 3 3 then 8 3 works too.. all the best,

--- 帖子 #206 ---
anybody know how to get an image to appear here so i can show you what i mean about the stochastic...i seem incapable of doing it..lol...thanks

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Thanks for this pipinator.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi fxxx, Thanks for the indicator, would you be kind enough to post the settings you input for the indicator to look just like the image you posted. I'm having a tough time trying to figure out the settings here. Thanks a lot, Mr T

Ok i figured it out myself. Thanks

Hi, Danoid! Congrat to you!!! I understand that you did large work about testing this method... and may be you wouldn't want to share all your details, but for so newbie in this business like me, can you explain some more about your criterias enter/exit... filters... Thanks a lot!!! ... and - sorry for my bad english...

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I will try to explain my methods and maybe include a few pics when I have the time (it might be this weekend when I finally have some free time).

Hi Danoid, hope you get the chance soon to post your charts, I for one would appreciate it. All the best from Ireland. Danny the wise man knows, what he does'nt know.

I notice that there are more and more indis in this thread! It was supposed to be a PA action system!!! This system is great and simple . Don't spoil it with so many indis. The only indi I use is the BBflat. It works great for confirmation. Thanks for your system, Tony.

their are trader looking to make money with fx for 10 - 20 years and more , they teach us fundamentals. Toni comes around and starts to tell us the most simple method on the planet. Does it work, i don't think so, if it would toni would be trading like crazy not telling us to do what he is struggling to do imho don't waste your time with it. He got an other thread and ask "what you think is the market going up or down". With his method it does not matter at all, so why is he asking? Common sense

--- 帖子 #221 ---
This is one of the ways i`ve been trading for about 4yrs, not sure why some people are being so negative about it, you are simply using the high of the previous bar as your entry and taking some pips. My set up is this: 1hr candles 14 sma Direction of the sma determines buy or sell, if the sma is pointing up we look for buy set ups, opposite for shorts. Once the current candle closes we simply use the next candle to push through the high for a long entry, as long as the previous bar was bullish and the sma was up, opposite for shorts using the low of the previos bear candle. Thats it, it was a system used by a trader called shiraz, i think i got around 02/03 time, the formula was called CTF ( champion trader formula), like i said, not my normal stratergy but it works pretty well for a few pips. Gez

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi MEA, I followed you on several threads and noticed you spend your time to denigrate the sytems freely offered by others. Are you able to offer us a nice system like this one? If not, why don't you leave the thread and leave us alone???

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Well said Gez

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Danoid, Thanks for the suggestion of using PSAR, that sure does help. Can you explain a bit more by what you mean buyt using the two EMA's with a period of 12 on high and low...etc" I could not figure out what you mean. Although it is eary morning and I have not had coffee yet. :-) Keith

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Demoed 4 times using USDJPY.... 4 winners in a row. Thanks to Tony Two Candles!!!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
thanks for the laugh!! That is so funny and true!

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Yeah right! That graph is BS. Maybe your kidding?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I've created an ea to test this method. I've added filters for the two 5 SMMA's and for trading hours (which are parameters). I haven't been very lucky though with the results. I'm sure there is a way to make this work by opening multiple trades, closing one at one rate, letting the others ride, etc but none of that is in the EA. I'm posting both the compiled version and the original source code so if anyone has any suggestions or spots any bugs, please let me know. Thanks, Jason

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Your full of the big sloppy brown stuff.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Am not. I looked at Jason's code for a few seconds, I believe he is not using stop orders, which is what this method calls for.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
You shouldnt come on FF and post bogus EA results. What is the point? I dont believe for a second you made an EA from this system and got those results. Your full of it

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hi all... Marlow Yip.........just taking a look here in some free time.....how long have you tested this idea to come to the conclusion it does not work....Of course I am assuming thats your position on the method..I could be wrong.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I dont know if this system works or not. Seems to work well for Tony. Im just saying that goofball Danoid said he made an EA with great results and I can tell you that is BS! Im sure if Tony is trading the system then it must work, but 99% of the time EA's dont work and for him to say he took a night and threw together some filters bla bla bla and got those good results is BS.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi Tony Are you still using this system, and if so what has your success rate been? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
can someone please post recent examples of their charts using this system? i keep failing with it

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi there, I`ve been reading this thread since yesterday and just made a quiq back test on E/U - one trade / day, at london open. Sice 13 may till today, i saw that in 25 situations the candle from london open, had the same color as the one before it, generating profit. Also, in 10 situations, observing the wicks, it might of looked like a continuation of the prior bar, validating a buy / sell signal, only for the price to go in the oposit direction, generating losses. This is only a quick visual test. I`ll be testing some more. Regards, Necre

--- 帖子 #237 ---
yea keep us updated man. can u post a chart showing us what u mean as well? thx

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I have not read the whole thread so this might have already been covered. I have used a similar system for years in forex and other markets . This system is profitable if you use common sense and discretion. I believe tony is trying to make 20-40 pips per day. so its about 2-3 trades. If you trade overlap sessions then you have approx. 7-10 good candles to trade. If you follow a few pairs then you have at least 30-40 apportunities per day. So pick the best ones. Use filters. I use the following: simple moving averages, a 9 period for trend for example, don't trade against trend. I also look at candle formations and take hammers etc,. my point is that any system can be simple, but some discretion and trading knowledge is needed even with the simplest system. If you blindly follow the rules and actually follow them 100% then you will not do any better than an automated system. this is my opinion for what its worth.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Good system. But doesn't work in choppy markets - then you have to switch to another strategy.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
hey danoid are u gonna post your EA or rules anytime soon? thx!

--- 帖子 #241 ---
The rules aren't any different than Tony's rules, except for the addition of the 12 Hi/Low EMAs, PSAR (with a setting of .03), AO, and ADX (with a setting of 2). For going long: Close of last bar is above the 12 Hi EMA, price &gt; PSAR, AO of 1 hour ago is &gt; AO of 2 hours ago, and ADX of 1 hour ago is &gt; ADX of 2 hours ago. For going short: Close of last bar is below the 12 Low EMA, price &lt; PSAR, AO of 1 hour ago is &lt; AO of 2 hours ago, and ADX of 1 hour ago is &gt; ADX of 2 hours ago. In other news, my EA made 3 losing trades that wiped out all my gains...so perhaps this isn't my holy grail after all. I have it set to make only one trade per day now (...greed is the downfall of this trading method!). Optimal trading time for that one trade appears to be from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm EST.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
well thanks for sharing Dan, appreciate it! Damn man, 3 trade wiped out all your winners? What the hell is your RR? Where are you placing your stop?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I was exiting when the PSAR reverses, the EA wouldn't have worked if I used Tony's stop method.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Dear Tony Trader. I have following the thread and hopefully i am right on this. 1st candle at 1st hour is bullish,so the 2nd hour candle should be bull..am i right?..so when to enter position,at the beginning of the 2nd hour?... please explain..thanks

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Your post was the first in this thread in a month. This usually means the thread is dying or already dead for some reason..... most often from poor trading results. I was attracted by the logic behind this very simple trade; and if it proved to be consistently profitable on a monthly basis, it would give me another trade trigger compatible with my overall trading strategy..... that being to bank small but quick profits enroute to creating FREE (no-risk!) trades that can be left (with minimal management) to run for hours, days, weeks, even months. You might also want to take a look at the DIBS thread in the FF trading system list. The DIBS mention is FYI; please, no DIBS discusation on Tony's thread! "Go forth and multiply"..... your profits that is!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I think this system has some potential on various time frames and we should resurrect this thread for some additional study. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
thanks 4 pdf PREDICTING PRICE ACTION: USDJPY 15 pip trigger When price moves 15 pips in either direction, what is the probability that it will continue to the following values with the currency and interval shown? For example, when USDJPY moves 15 pips up or down on the 5 minute interval, the probability that it will continue to +80 (+65 net) is 4.0%. PAIR: USDJPY INTERVAL: 60 MINUTE CHART +20 +30 +40 +50 +60 +70 +80 +90 +100+ 91.6% 72.9% 58.9% 47.8% 37.4% 30.5% 24.3% 19.0% 14.9%

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Could you clear this up are you saying there is a 91.6% chance of positive pips after the pair moves 15 pips so if I place a buy stop 15 pips at previous high or sell stop previous low I have a 91.6% of making pips on a 60 min chart or 5 min chart just trying to understand what you are saying here

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I would think trading with the trend should significantly improve the returns of this system............. Then use a manually trailing stop to the previous bars high or low depending of course on the direction of the trade. http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/9...ncapture1g.png

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Just open the PDF-file, mentioned there. Anyway, they used some rules during their tests, not all candles were counted.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Years of experience with a similar method - sounds great! Could you provide some details about how you set SL / TP / BE? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
This still works great!

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hello all, Just thought I would drop a note and say thanks to Tony for such a simple and effective system and sharing it to the FF community. I am using this system with some small changes and am having a reasonable amount of success thus far. As far as the Pairs I am using I started with uds/jpy as Tony suggested and then moved to eur/jpy as it seemed to have more price movement with out an unmanageable amount of volatility. Time frames? I have been trading this method beginning at the Asian open and ending around mid way through the us session.. I use an initial 15 pip stop and take profit depends on PA. And its important to mention that the Stop depends on PA also.. Yes, initial is 15 pips but if the trade is entered and the PA stalls I will exit at a small loss or small profit.. I also Size my trades according to PA and/or if I recently had a huge winner on a large position.. or a string of 2-3 winners in a row..I will decrease my Size by 2/3.. Thanks again Tony! 399BC

Yes, update the community!! I´m late in this post, the party is over...

so, viewing a static chart you will notice 90% of time a 2nd bull bar will have a high 20 pips above the 1st bull bar's high (and vice versa for bear bars), but from a dynamic point of view (looking at tick chart, looking the price in action), what is the chance that the price will hit the 20pips TP instead of the 5~10pips (mental) stop loss? fact is, SL will be hit more often than the TP bcoz (1) price will likely retrace a bit and testing the breakout and (2) from the distance of the TP and the SL, ie. 20 : 10, it is obvious that chance of SL being hit is 2 times higher than the TP being hit.

Hey jtrade, thanks for the link..... interesting info.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Guys, In this one I could go for some nice pips but I didn't cause the PSAR was against it . Did I do the right thing ? Please give me your imput . One more thing. Thanks to Tony for this great thread. It's my first tactic I'll try and for the moment the only problem I found is that the damn broker is acting very late to my requests. Fahren

--- 帖子 #259 ---
You missed 7 trades in the chart you showed us.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Ignore those trades mate. Just tell me your opinion regarding those 2 candles. Not ignoring PSAR was a good idea ?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Tony, we have almost the same idea... long time ago I create a method name "SK Mode"... but it use daily candlestick and assume if previous daily candlestick is bear, then the next candlestick is bear too.. but my entry is fix and only trade after 00:30 candlestick time using TF m30 for viewing.. anyway, I like your idea...

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I just found this thread yesterday, read through it all and I'm demoing right now. I'm going to start off with a simple 10TP and 20SL using Tony's rules, I'll adjust if need be later and I'll report back my findings.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi Tony do you alll use the one hour time frame?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hey Tony thanks I just like to acknowledge you for share a simple systems that reminds us that this business can be as simple or as complex as one choose to makes it. This is a Jewel. For the man who never make mistakes usually work for the man who do.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I recently found this thread and I like the simplicity of it. It's a shame that the thread has died because, this seems to be one of the better systems. Does anybody use Tony's template, on the 1 min chart, with the 1 hour overlay? If so, does it slow your PC down quite a lot? It does with mine. Regardless of that it seems to work quite well.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Many thanks Tony for your generosity in providing this simple and hopefully profitable method of trading. I'm still rereading this thread and still putting together what the consensus or verdict is as to whether this is a consistent winning strategy. I sincerely wish it has proven to be and request others to please keep this thread alive with your feedback, especially if you have been using this method. Thank you in advance for any replies. John

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Oddly, pennfx this system seems to work, if you are very careful. If a one hour bar moves fairly strongly, it stands to reason that there should be sufficient momentum to continue another 10 20 pips, unless of course, a support, resistace level or pivot gets in the way. I have been trading this system live for a week or so, about 10 winners, and only one loss. Shakey

--- 帖子 #268 ---
How big SL do you guys use? thanks

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Thanks Shakey for your reply and glad to hear you've had good initial results. Do you use other indicators or tweaked this system other then what Tony has outlined, for instance do you use one minute chart to see momentum, and do you enter at 5 pips or wait a little longer? Appreciate it and best wishes to you.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
hey, hoichoi At the time of candle close, I set pending entry for 4 pips above/below close price (if it is long, add the spread, since trade will open at the ask line) I start at 20 pip stop, but that is only temporary to avoid disaster. If I am in front of the screen and trade opens, I start moving the stop down a few pips at a time as the price moves in my favor. I set target at 20, but if in front of screen, usually close trade myself if price seems to stall anywhere along the way. often, begin to manually trail stop when profit reaches 8-10 pips but usually only score a few pips that way. The big problem with this way is this. . . taking so many tiny profits, will almost inevitably cause loss of all profits with just one or two 20 pip losses. Even a success rate of 90% will be mostly wiped out with one 15 or 20 pip loss One GOOD thing about this system: many of your losers NEVER EVEN OPEN, thus avoid loss. Sometimes the best trade is to not trade at all. Shakey

--- 帖子 #271 ---
The minute chart has always been too quick for me to digest. I mostly flip back to the 5 min. There will possibly be up to 12 5 min candles during your trade period. Pretty much watch to see if POSSIBLE reversal candle is happing, like a hammer/shooting star forming, or possible higher high, lower low. This is dicey, because you will have to close trade before complete pattern is formed, and therefore, might leave a lot of money on the table/ IT MAY BE JUST AS WELL TO SET UP THE TRADE, LET IT OPEN, IGNORE IT, CLOSE IT AFTER AN HOUR (if it hasn't stopped or reached it's target already) AND TAKE YOUR PROFIT/LOSS. Despite early success, I have doubts about the system, and whether a person can be consistent enough with having to manipulate so much for so long. I do use a couple of filters, which I can tell you about later when have time. Shakey

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi all Why not trading only the first H1 Candle of the European or US market open? The European session starts with the Frankfurt open, 1 hour befor London opens.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Thanks again Shakey for your review. It does seem like a tough way to grind out some pips and it appears the risk to reward is not too great if shooting for 10-20 pips. I would greatly appreciate you posting what filters you use and then I'll give it a try and post my results here. Be well.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Have a look at this guys, might be of interest to you, clear entry and exit rules at the end. Gez

Here is a sample pic, Sorry, I didn't have a sample of actual trade, so I admit that this example is cherry picked. I like the basic concept of this system. Tony has put a lot of time and study into this system, and appreciate him putting out there for us Basically, I have had some success adding these indicators, though I am usually not an idicator junkie. The pivots and currency meter can be found http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=219398 , or at least links to them. A word about the currency meter: I will not discuss this meter, nor include a link directly to it. You can find a discussion of it at the link provided above. 1. add 5 moving average to chart. The signal candle should cut across the 5 ma. Usually, the price will challenge the 5 ma, at some point, before continuing the long/short move. 2. Add the 34 MA to chart. If price is above 34, take only long, below only short (Ignore the fact that in my example, the trade happens on an MA cross, This is just a coincidence) ( It just now dawned on me that an MA cross might be a good additional filter). 3. Note that signal candle has short wick. May indicate good momentum. Also a pinbar makes a good signal candle. 4. I have been moving stop to break even at 6 pips profit. 5. Nearby Pivots and round numbers make good targets, if you are insecure about the 10 or 20 pip targes that are recommended. 6. on currency meter, Note that USD is stronger than JPY. I have also had some luck with this on the AU and UCad pairs during the european session. If profits taken are too small, one 20 pip stoploss can wipe out a day's work in a flash. I have made a little profit from it over all, but I have a tendency to micro manage. Hope some of this helps, and hope Tony doesn't feel I have screwed up his system. Shakey

Hi all, I am about to test live the following which is very similar to tonys system with a few changes, take a look (unable to upload pics at present so will discribe the best i can. 1/ open up a 15min chart with candles only. (get rid of all clutter eg graph lines ) 2/ add a 5 / 8ma crossover indicator with alert (change 5 &amp; 8 to 1 &amp; 2) (search FF and you will find )this will only add directional arrows no lines) And there you have it - go back in history and just LOOK !!! My Additions are : Entry = instantly as new bar opens. Exit = ATR or close of next candle. SL = High or low of last candle. I think you should be able to make an average of 15 pips per trade with a better win lose ratio. I also think using the 1hr Time frame tonys is using could be more profitable if using the ATR as above. Thanks Hope this helps !!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Thanks, nightpipper . This looks very promising. Can you post the 5/8 ma crossover indicator that you use? Thanks, in anticipation.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
here ya go....remember to set ma`s to 1/2

--- 帖子 #279 ---
WOW !! Thanks for your very fast and helpful response, cjd . You're a star .....

--- 帖子 #280 ---
no real need for the crossover indicator. I've put it on my 15min EURUSD chart and it just put's arrows on nearly every bar, a lot of them wrong.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi Kraven, Please explain your setup . Could you also show a pic ? As from what i have seen today it works for me !!. But if you have reason to differ can you explain further. Has anyone easy got any commets after testing my alternative ? Please note i cannot view forum every day due to work commitments but please upgrade Tonys system plus my alternative as we are all here to learn . thanks Nightpipper

--- 帖子 #282 ---
nightpiper thanks for ur update could u explain a bit more in your picture? thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hello nightpipper, I've took it off my chart from before as it was often showing a down arrow on an up bar (if that makes sense). However I've just reloaded it and it seem's to be working as you suggested, so may try it the next time. I've been trading this way on a 15min chart for a week or so now (waiting for a bar to close in a different direction then going with that direction for the next bar) and it's worked well. My SL has been a max of 15 or a near resistance/support area or the size of previous bar (under 15pips). I target 17pips (incl. spread). For 3hrs today (12-15:00 GMT) using EURUSD only I made 5 trades, 1 loss - 4 wins for a total of 53 pips. A lot of these trades could have ran further.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Thanks NightPiper.... You make this strategy even more promising... Will try it very soon....

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi just subscribing

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Picture explained. Note i am only viewing from this picture so exact figures are not shown + ATR is not available. ( will explain later how to look back in history ) Here goes, starting from left hand side. Trade 1 - up arrow-green signal candle- on close of this bar enter your buy trade - your SL=low of the signal bar-enter your TP=ATR - await the close of bar - If Tp &amp; SL have not been touched close trade. In this case without ATR it looks as if the trade broke even. Trade 2 - up-without ATR made a loss Trade 3 - up " " profit Trade 4 - up " " profit Trade 5 - down" " Profit Trade 6 - up " " Loss Trade 7 - down " " Profit Trade 8 - up " " Profit Trade 9 - down " " Profit Trade 10 -up " " Profit I hope this helps !!! Nightpipper

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi Kraven, I hope the crossover helps even more - keep us updated. Thanks Nightpipper

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi all, The thing i like about this system is that instead of waiting all day on a trend system for good signal to make 70 pips, you can more than match that in a matter of a couple of hours. Im sure i am not the only one who has tried the many trend systems out there, but as they say the market travel sideways most of the time , so this is the ideal situation for us . I have breifly looked at ofter time frames and they all seem to work pretty well up to the 1hr time frame after that it seems to get a bit ramdom. but if anyone can test these and others TFs please let us know how you progress. All the best Nightpipper

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi all, Visual testing for a demo/live chart . 1/ I personally install 2x ATRs 1 set at 5 bars back other set at 20 bars back. Install the first ATR into its own window as normal - go into its parameters and set 'style' to none this will then turn of the line graph and you will only have the reading of the ATR on the top of the page. The for your next ATR drag it from the navigator listing onto the first ATR panel you installed and again turn of the graph as above . There you have you existing ATR readings. But not these are only showing the existing readings not the historical. 2/ Historical readings of ATR. Simply click on Data window icon at top of page - give it time to load - you will then be able to see the 2 x ATR reading you have just installed at the bottom of the listings. As you move your curser on screen you can now seethe historical readings of the ATR for each candle. Sorry if i am tell some of you how to suck eggs ,but it took me some time to find these simple methods so i hope it helps someone out there, in visually back testing. All the best Nightpipper.

Hi Nightpipper, Could you upload a template? Especially with settings for the alert as I'm gettings arrows on nearly every bar. thanks

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi All Will try to upload template , Im no computer wizz . Hope it works. nightpipper

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Thanks Nighttipper, But you did not have the macross alert loaded when you made the template. Are u still using it? thanks

--- 帖子 #293 ---
the arrows aren't on the template mate. Nightpipper how are you using adx now as a filter?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi terminex What are these Macro alerts ? NP

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi Kraven, They seem ok on my old screen ? Try enlarging them by going into settup and width sections. Hope this works. NP

--- 帖子 #296 ---
It's ok mate I just inserted them myself. Really need a good filter for this system How are you using ADX, if it's above 20 then trade is ok? If it is i've tried both with and without ADX - like normal - some are good, some bad.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi Kraven, I totally agree, Hi Kraven, i agree totally, I guess its what one is used to using and trusts the most . personally my favourites are: 1/ Bollinger bandwidth Indi. (The original squeeze indi before it went up market ) i will try to post a simple picture ) 2/ Then the Stochastics in that order. Used singlely or together. Every one knows about this indi. Thanks Nightpipper. What about this partnership below ???? (picture ) Blue area = rising momentum (direction unknown until viewing stochs direction probably trend area ) Green area = falling momentum ( congestion area - sideways channel likely ) Can we work with this ???

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Trading with the slope of the 20 SMA (BB center line), the steeper the better, might offer 2 advantages: 1. Higher probability of winning trades 2. These trades have the potential of going for alot more pips than 1xATR. You would have the option of opening 2 positions. The first one 1xATR, second position 2xATR or let it run trailing stop loss. With the BB, you could also look for reversal patterns (engulfing, long wicks etc.) at outer bands.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
If you trade against the slope (trend), you can put probabality in your favor with divergence. I'm usually not a fan of MA crossovers, but I'm liking this simple strategy. I hope I haven't complicated it too much. In addition to the counter slope trades, look at the nice runs trading with the steep slope.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I meant to say , moving average cross alerts. The settings are not working for me.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Are your settings faster EMA-1, slower EMA-2 instead of the default settings of 5/8? The 1/2 settings seem to coincide with candle color change quite nicely.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi Guys... Just throw in whatever indi or EA or even a whole new software into this or any trading system to make you more comfortable using it. Then practice and develop your intuition and perception with the experience of using it. Grow our skills with the system like Mr. Tony did with this system. With a discipline, hopefully one day we might taste the fruit of our labor. Maybe Like Mr Tony did with this (his) system here. Thanks to Mr Tony, nightpiper, kraven and everybody in this thread... Keep the pips comin guys!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Yes well can you help with the settings. I change the 5/8 with 1/2 right? If that's the case then I get candles on almost ever bar..

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Terminex I had the same, see a few posts back. I had to re-load it. It still gives the odd red down arrow on an up green bar but remember it's just another visual aid. use the bars as your real guide.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Maybe you can share your charts so newbies like me can understand it better?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
iamnoel don't know if that was directed at me? At the moment i'm looking at several different strategies (15min to 4hr). Pretty confusing at the moment as I have several on the same charts. Plus I'm still not sure if this system is valid. If I do come up with something for this i will post it.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Ok here's a pic. ignore big blue and purple arrows and squiggly blue line and the Demark lines. they belong to different trials which i don't want to go into. I have ADX at 9. when +DI line (green) goes through -DI line (red) it indicates a change in trend to BUY (up). pink squares. when this line &gt;20 its a stronger trend, when it passes ADX gray line it very strong trend up. Reverse for SELL (black squares) this is just an observation and trying this in real time may be different. Note the MAcrossover alert (little red and blue arrows) are sometimes wrong. I've circled these pink.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Well I've had a very good day. I find when the $ dives as it did this afternoon it makes making pips a lot easier. Didn't really try this system today. Even though it's still on my charts. So I hope those who did done well. Been running a few other systems of late and they all came good today bigstyle. Will look at this again sometime this week too see if anyone's found a reliable filter.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi all, Not sure if the origanal 5/8cross you are using is the same as mine ( which is on the template i sent earlier ) as i do not have any problems which some of you seem to have . I will try and upload a copy for you to try. one in mq4 the other in ex4 Thanks Nightpipper

--- 帖子 #310 ---
New to FF so thanks for having me. I started reading this thread about 2 nights ago (I have only been through the first 7 pages so the conversation may have changed direction), but I thought it would be interesting to "forward test" throughout the day at work when I had a few minutes. I captured the screen shot below at about 0840 EST (1240 GMT). Times on the chart are EST (GMT-4). The breakout boxes are from the EU 5M TF. White arrows are entry and yellow arrows are TP. (Note: The data is not from a broker but from CMS FOREX.....I can't get to my broker at work). If you sat down to your computer at 0300 EST (0700 GMT as Tony recommends), used a 10 pip SL / TP, and used the 0300 EST Bull close to trigger your 0400 Bear setup.....you would have a 100% win rate (3 for 3 in 6 hours) through 0900 EST. Trade 1 is outside of the recommended time period....but a winner. Trade 2 would have hit the TP exactly to the tenth of a pip. (you probably would have had to use discretion here since it was so tight. It would depend on how many decimal places you can see) Trade 3 was a winner, but it was deceptive. As you can see in the breakout box. PA ran straight up and hit the TP before retracing. Trade 4 since the 0700 candle closed bear (slightly) the 0800 then became a setup for a winning trade within the 0900 candle. (the 0900 did retrace after this screen shot, but an easy winner). I've continued to watch throughout the day (now 1400 EST / 1800 GMT), and there is actually another winner using the 1200 and 1300 EST candles. That is 4 wins in 4 trades (5 if you count trade 1 which is outside the recommended time period), and if you have Tony's bankroll (enough to trade 50 Lots) you just pocketed $20K. Not bad.......I'll have to keep an eye on this one.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Nice chart izzysdad. It was a fairly consistent trend this afternoon (GMT). I tried the original hr chart (Tony's idea) but not for 10pips (more like 20). I take it you didn't watch each candle form? Did none hit the 10pip SL first?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Nope.....none the 10pip SL. If you go back and look at the 1M and 5M timeframes....none of the trades hit their SL before hitting TP (I just went back to check the 5M for the afternoon trade). I did not watch anything form before about 0730 EST (1130 GMT), but I did go back to the 1M and 5M charts to get a feel for how they would have formed. I don't think any of the trade candles actually reached their SL at any time. Some were close (specifically the afternoon trade that wasn't in the chart...was about 1.5 pips away). I went with the 10 pip TP to get the higher win %. That said, only time will tell if it will produce over 90% winners (as Tony indicated for his regular pair). It can't always be this easy though. You are correct that the trends were pretty bullish during the AM hours of the NY session. I'll keep watching to see how this plays out over a longer test period.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
The reason you see "wrong" sinals is because when the two MAs cross it will show the "signal" on the charts. And if you watch MA crossings they sometimes cross, then "open" back up again and move in its original direction. So this indi leaves a signal when the MAs actually cross (not at the close of the candle) and will leave it there even if the MAs open back up. And then it will leave a signal again at the next crossing. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Did you account for the spread?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I was not able to fully account for the spread when making the chart. My info was not that good (internet feed at work), but going forward I plan to use by broker's data each evening. That said. IMHO. If a good trader were watching this all happen I think it still would have been a profitable day. Three of them would have won easily (if you assume a 2.5-3 pip spread (including the first trade and the trade in the NY afternoon.......NY afternoon may not have made a full 10, but a close on candle close would have netted most). The other 2 (I can't see them right now, but I think they were trades 2 and 3) could have been closed out as winners if you were watching the 5M during the trade. I think that is particularly true on trade 3 where you can see the hourly high right next to the arrow (in the breakout box) and about 15 minutes later you can see a lower high. You may have wanted to exit at that point (lower high) considering there wasn't that much time left in the hour and you had most of your 10 pips. Trade 2 may have been tough, but even there you would have had to close on candle close. You might have lost 2-3 pips. After all that, I think you could conservatively say the you would be net positive 15-25 pips. Like I said.....it can't be that easy. It did look promising though. Cheers

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Helo all... Been doing observation with this strategy for a couple of days or so and I know that the ATR and ADX is always "too much details" to read for me so I tried different approach. RSI is my favorite. Please check this out: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Chart above is EU H1, FX Pro Demo GMT +2. Observation time: Look for Candle that touch the outer bands or even better when they passed the bands and hits a known resistance or support level. RSI 5 Pass 70 for sell and 30 for buy.. Trade: Exactly when you hear the sound of the Green/Red arrow appears. SL at Top or bottom of the same candle with Arrow. (around 10 - 20 pips ussually, but it depends on how soon you enter the trade after you hear the allert). Been shooting for 10 pips and won. But as you can see that all the trades have a good potential to developed further more with this. Maybe we can shoot for 20-30(?). Surely I need to find the best exit strategy to define the best time to bail out from the trade. Suggestion needed here. Those are the good thing, now the bad things. If you are not watching the chart all day, you have to be lucky enough to be there when this thing happens. I was lucky enough to get 3 trades in last 2 days. Won straight 30 pips in 3 trades. Worth it if we play with big lots, but for mini lots I dont know if it's worth the time. Maybe we can get more signal with less timeframe but I could see that the RSI somehow get less reliable on less time frame(?). For some of us who dont have much time in front of Computer, maybe we can play this strategy with multiple pairs opened for better chances to get signals and enter when you see one......I dont know...need to test further... EA maybe?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=239353 If anyone wants to trade based on price action without watching a one hour chart, you might want to check out the above thread. Similar premise, but better indicator, IMHO

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Similar strategy with post 316. I try to figure out what would happen if I apply thie rules on post 316 to UJ-H1. Not actually taking the trade, only observing. Check this out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sorry if a bit confusing, but I just think that this might be worth to look. Red for trades without RSI 5 and outer band cross approval. Some won and some lose Yellow (Yellow) for trades with RSI 5 and outer band Approval. All Won. I think if I include the midline-bands as approval, we can add some winner here. Will try this further but I will not put or try another indi on it as it will only complicate this system too much. If this one fail for me then I'll go with Tony's original and practice further more to develop my instings and skill... Thanks Tony.

For EJ cross... In last couple of days, It looks like you can win 20 pips easily if you enter a trade everytime an arrow appears on H1. Please take a look at my sweetspots 10 pips levels on background. The only trade that migh not yield for 20 pips is the one I mark with white circle. Take a look.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Could it be the best Pair for this strategy.... I dont know... PS: I like to keep my TP and SL Hidden, that's the reason for Swiss Army EA.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Is the arrow formed at the end of the candle? What are the settings for the arrows? thanks

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I observe further back for EU cross.... (Correction: EU not EJ) If you enter a trade everytime an arrow appears on EJ H1, shooting for 10 pips and put SL on H/L candle with arrow, looks like you would won all the time. (except for the trade with white circle.. which is ridiculous to enter a trade with that such tiny candle.... ) If you want to make 20 pips, just keep it after London open and before Asian starts. Take a look....and please examine my sweetspots 10 pips levels on background. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Correction: EURUSD H1, FXPro Demo.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
For a big long Candle it seems the arrow formed up right on the same candle but for most candle is at candle closed. Use the same setting Nightpiper use for EMA cross over signal, just set EMA1 = 1 and EMA 2 = 2. Hope this helps... Btw, I am on trade right now shooting for SHORT 20 pips... will see where it goes... It think it's going well because it's already pass 10 pips by now. Update ... Just closed with 20 pips as expected......

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Do you mean like in the attached pic?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
This one is EJ.... For EJ, SL at H/L previous candle before candle with Arrow (or about 20-40 pips). If we also shooting for 20 - 40 pips... tell me what you think.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) EJ H1, FX Pro Demo.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
nice work niceguy. My concern would be the SL at the PREVIOUS candle from the arrow (2x1hr candles could mount to a big loss). Still looks promising so I'll check it out. Did you decide which pair is best?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
You are right Kraven... Yes I'm concern with the SL too... but I think if we maintain a 90% of win like the way the chart shows to us above, we should give a bit room for SL. (I think this is where good experience on reading candle is come to play) Honestly I am tired of reading people fighting over best R/R to use for a system. Seems so endless and so exhausting for me... To avoid loosing big... I think we should just simply not entering trade if the arrow candle already move more than 50 pips (?) or whatever amount you cant accept losing , or enter it anyway with you own R/R SL. Best Pair? From my brief observation: EU for 10 Pips EJ for 20 Pips Please test this, and for the moment lets' just forget adding extra indicator to this. Dont forget to share your result to benefit others....

Got people PM me asking why only shooting 10 - 20 pips. Please keep it here guys... Well, it is simply to keep what Tony proposing with the original strategy. This one supposed to be " Fast 10 -20 pips profits ". Please read post #1st I know some of the trades, especially the trades that goes along with the trends can be developed further. So it's up to you.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Marking the risky trades on chart with Red circle. Just using common sense here... If the price is already go too long in one move, it might not go further long. Update: Just closed out 10 pips each with EJ and EU. The EJ trades is the one that shown on chart

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Just switched back on and had the E/J set up on the 1hr. Blue arrow under bar. Who'd have allowed +23pips then it crashed to a max loss of -50pips next candle (now) is coming down too. The arrows may give a different perfect-no loss impression when you open the chart and apply, but live may be different. be cautious. Time to call it a day +130pips. Will look into the EJ 1hr more tomorrow (all though Fridays are dodgey). Happy pips all.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks kRaven... Yes Live would be so much different... Not gona live until I am convinced enough with the system. By the way... I dont have green arrow with EJ here Attached Image (click to enlarge) must be the EU... nope I pass the green arrow for long on that one. It's too far away from the center (20 EMA).

--- 帖子 #332 ---
yes the arrow repaint the next bar which we enter...so seeing the arrows in back test pretty much different from live.the reason is when arrow show up then the next bar turn againts us maybe around half of the signal bar we still see the arrow,but try refreshing it by moving it to other TF and back to our current TF.......arrow gone.unless current bar go back in the right direction then the arrow will show up again

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Not going with the latest signal for long on EU.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Going south with EU... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Yes I already know the arrow repaints. That's the reason why I'm testing this.. to see how reliable the arrow is and find a way to take the advantage of it and to understand the weakness of it... I believe a good basic knowledge of candle movement patterns still required in every strategy... If the arrow does not repaint... then I think we simply have a holy grail here... Just test it and have fun with the process at the moment...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Arrows? Are you using Arrows/indicator/ea to show you entry? Thats not good. In the same, this is the exact strategy I use, and have been using for 3 and a half years. It's basically a price action reversal system, using Dark Cloud, Pin Bars (a.k.a Hammers), &amp; Engulfed candlestick formations. Not a complicated system at all, you just have to learn the basic of candlestick reversal patterns. No indicator/ea needed! The idea is to trade high contract position, with as little market exposure as possible. As I've always said, "its easier to make 10 pips than 100 pips" You're on the right track, just lose the indicators.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Each to our own I suppose. I've tried candle patterns with only moderate success. 10pips can be as good as anything, it all depends on the consistancy of the win rate. Because if you have a 80-90% success rate, a good RR then you have enough faith to use large lotsizes. Just had a last minute look at the EJ chart and the arrow was gone. But I agree with you Niceguy. Just cause it repaint doesn't make it useless, it just means back testing is useless.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Thanks Jhig... You are the guy with trendline breakout trading system right? I trade your system live and it works. But still need to learn much and still using a micro lots.... If this thing is live, I would only trade on top/ bottom of the trend as usual and make my 10 pips there... Somebody come up with the idea of using the arrow.. so I test it to see how reliable it is... Update: Last trade on EU, just burned good 30 pips...

--- 帖子 #338 ---
anyone can tell me what bolliger band settings u guys are using?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I second that. Would be nice of Tony to drop in and say hi or something, don't you guys think? Anyways, thanks Tony for the system. I just wanted to touch the issue of filtering for a sec. A lot of guys here are trying to come up with some sort of a filter to improve the hit rate. I just thought I'll share my idea as well. From my experience, the best filter is the one that does not lag. Everything you put on your chart (adx, stochs, ma's, etc.) depends on the price itself, so how can it serve as a filter? So, what does not lag then? The price itself, nothing else. So, a good filter would be another timeframe, and only higher timeframe. You only look at lower timeframes to time your entry, and you look at higher timeframes to filter your set up. Look at my screenshot. There's my H1 timeframe in the middle. Once I see a bullish setup for example (bear-bull-time to enter?) I immediately look at H4 and Daily (the two time frames on the bottom), if H4 is also looking bullish, I have green light, if it doesn't, I look at Daily, if Daily looks bullish, then I might consider taking this setup (though it will not be an A+ setup), then I look at 1min and 5min on the top, my timing time frames, and time my entry, they both have to start looking bullish as well. This, in my humble opinion, is the best way to filter and time an entry. No need for anything else, just price itself. I do have stochs on the charts as you can see, but they are there mostly for fun, but if stochs are all UP on all timeframes, that adds to the confidence greatly. Some people trade multi-timeframe stochs with great success, but I still believe that price itself is the only real-time, non-lagging thing.

After one harvests the pips from the second candle, do the same rules apply for the next candle if it opens 5 pips in your favor (ie let it run)?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Kraven, What set up are you using? The 1 hour arrows? thanks

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Confirmed that masterpiecefx... Actually I use this screen setup below for Live account... Take a look the white circle... Does it interest You? The mini chart will save your space from having multiple window or switch TF back and forth.... Going south... baby.... just a bit more... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Yes terminex it's the 1hr Niceguy can you post the "multi-chart" indi please. I'm going to throw something in from another thread from FF as I'm having a fair bit of success mixing the two threads together. Same principle as here, Any pair?? (i use G/U mainly) 1hr chart 5mins or so before the bar closes just take a look, get the feel of is the bar going more up or down. At the close of the bar check the bull/bear helper (green up/white down). if it's green and the last chart bar was up (important!!) then wait for new bar to move up 5pips and buy. If you've been watching the bar 5mins before and you see it moving up it often leads to a better trade and fills you with more confidence of a quick entry. If the bull/bear helper is green and the last bar was red. No trade For a sell. If the last bar was down and the bullbear is white, wait for new bar to move 5pips down and enter. you can get more info on the bull bear strength by going into indi's opening the bull indi, open the bear indi (standard on metatrader)then opening the data window. This will give you a precise bulls to bears number. Hope this is clear as it works well when you get the hang of it. SL 15 TG that's up to you, i go for 15 but if the price keeps going up i'll stay in. If the price has moved up a lot through the day I'll not stop long. hope this makes sense

That's stratmens minichart indicator. I don't have it, but just search for it.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Kraven, Could you post a pic? Been watching charts too long today and the brain is fried. thanks.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Ok The chart realy isn't much good as you will see a green bar followed by a red- but you need to see how high this bar went bfore it turned back as that's your profit. You'll see the bull bear help is green all the way the bars with the tick are our first signal bar. If these a green (up) and the bull bear is Green (up) we buy the next bar (one's with the arrow) wait for it to go up 5pips (ish) before buying. that's it.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
bit choppy on the short term at the moment but using the above strat. I've sold at 4660 gbp/usd Now i've put this one up live it'll not win,

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thanks for the pic. I'm just doing the Jap at the moment on the 1 hour chart as per the original rules. I'll monitor this next week.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
gonna bail out early on this one at -8pips just didn't feel right. smaller time frames up and down. Plus the signal bar was retracing up when it closed. I like to see it going down so when the entry bar opens it's got some momentum.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
No offense, but your entry is absolutely wrong, you entered after 2 constructive red bars. which is a no trade as per original rule. Edit: The real entry was last hour.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Also a bit like FollowTheLeader? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=189552

--- 帖子 #352 ---
No probs Baazz but i did say that this wasn't this system but a combination of 2. here's the other thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=239951 I entered because of new bull bear direction. iamnoel never seen that one before, i may look later. My problem is i often use a short SL of 15 when it was previously recommended (on different thread) to use the signal bars open. In that case the bet would +30 now

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hey Kraven, you can have the mini chart from here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=127271 It's part of the THV system... Btw... Is the blue line on your chart is the "alf" ? No offense to this strategy but If I were you, I will trade with that line alone instead... The Euro seems a bit strange tonight.. unusual move...

--- 帖子 #354 ---
NiceGuy, that indicator for mtf looks so cool, would love to have it, could you post it please? Thanks. ps. oh, sorry, you've already posted the link above, didn't see it. never mind. thnx again.

Hi I just registered my account here and yet to make my first trade in Forex. I like Tony's Two candle system because of its simplicity. any one using this system consistently. I am planning to start trading this system with my micro account. any suggestions? usasa

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I trade this system daily. I use the original Tony rules. As long as you are patient and follow the rules you should be profitable.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Nice observations. But did you try it on 4hrs chart/candle? Did you consider the trend?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
This works on any TF but I found it results on a 1 hr TF became truly exceptional when I applied S/R and candlesticks as filters. It rarely fails when the turnaround candle forms an engulfing pattern or is a longwicked reversal candle. I also would rather see it break thru strong resistance or support. In other words, it’s a great method but it needs to be tempered by common sense.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
The method really looks quite simple. How long have you been using this system and on what TF? What is your success ratio with this system? Also if you can briefly lay down the rules you follow that will be great. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #367 ---

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I think you should forward test in a demo account for a month...... I have found little reliability in back testers. Also what was you money management? and leverage?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Money management - 1 mini lot per trade only from 10 000 usd account. 1:400 leverage. I think that if backtest is good there is an option to test in on demo. Please check if I programmed your system correctly. Maybe I did not understand something?

--- 帖子 #373 ---
read the rules again....... pick the best time of day....... use rational leverage....... and FORWARD TEST on a demo account. Back testers are such BS. Was your back tester running a 24 hr period or was it testing only during the peak trading periods?...6 GMT - 15 GMT you know... when london starts and overlaps into N.Y. for about 3 hours. What was your SL...... did you actually have one or did you just let it run to close of the candle? Basically what I saw on your equity curve was extremely unlikely. So at the risk of being redundant .... I shall reiterate......... Forward test on a demo account and toss the toy back tester.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
can some1 explain more details to me how its system work?when im start trade im look for the previous candle right?if its bull and next[right now is appear bull 5 pips i buy?] and if previous bear and now its appear bear -5 pips i should sell? and etc?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
hi lets say we are going short. what if the trade candle opens but does not immediately go short by 5 pips, but goes up on opening and keeps on going up, and say later comes down by 5 pips after about 20 mins. does this still count, and can we then go short ? or is that too late ? it could of course take a long time for it to move down 5 pips so how are we supposed to wait that long ? regards

--- 帖子 #378 ---
well put mr razor. This led me to believe and witness the orignal poster and ideas gets lost in programming and questions on basic forex questions that can be answered in google. I myself will take head to what you mention in not jumping from method to method and studying FOREX and not simply finding a "system" without understanding the inner workings of how FOREX works.thanks you for your wisdom.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I like this simple system, especially when you keep the original rules ORIGINAL. Craig Harris has a similar system on the 15 min. charts tweaked with some stochs and MA's but i had not much consistency there. I see that the original thread poster Tony is not around much anymore (probably because of our urge to make a nice red Ferrari into a camouflage green tank), but in case you are still looking at this thread Mr. Tony then i would like your opinion a bit more on using a multi timeframe check on filtering out possible bad trades. You thread is much appreciated as its a good eye opener for me.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
How can such a well explained simple strategy with charts get so screwed up by cockamane theorists? But I know the answer, they would rather pick holes and arguements than trade. All one has to do is pull up any 1H chart and see the possibilities. Oh well. p.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Tony thanks this looks so good and easy,I will try it out. I used to run some similar Strategy on GBP/JPY but the SL is what killed me. I like like this. It's worth trying for a few few weeks.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Long @ 1.3224 stop @ 1.32 TP = 20 pips Let's see.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
What timeframe?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Tony said in the first post 1Hr so I went with 1hour, failed trade two for two. Early days yet.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
RD: The only candles I use for this method are ones with no wicks to the closing side. When the hour is almost over, I also watch the M1 timeframe to monitor the price action closely. I also don't trade against the trend...much safer. And don't trade this method around news times. I trade USD/JPN only due to its low volatility. I have had pretty good success with the few trades I did. 3 wins, no losses, but I go for small pips, usually around 5 so the trade is not open for long periods. -Jacob

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I have only read the first post by the author ( and haven't gone through the whole 90 odd pages of this thread).. This simple strategy actually makes alot of sense. I think It could be traded profitably if its changed a little. Its a bit similar to different daily hi/lo strategies out there. You enter when either a High or a low is crossed. Maybe, we can add stochastics to our 1H charts and only enter if they too show us an UP (in case of long) and DOWN (in case of short).

--- 帖子 #387 ---
You don't really need to read much more than the first couple pages..... the rest turns into drivel from people trying to improve it .......

--- 帖子 #388 ---
OK so you need to read more than the first page, that done, 40 pips booked today on two trades.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Thanks Jacob I don't have the time to be behind the screen much but it is nice to add methods to one's library. I normally trade Pa on the daily TF so I would battle dropping to 1 min to watch for PA. I will take trades in the direction of the daily trend. Frank

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Frank...one good thing about this system is that it only requires me to begin looking at the charts about 5 minutes before each hour is up. If the H1 candle is not a good one (big wicks, no clear direction), I wait for the next hour. If the candle has potential, during those five minutes, I watch the PA on the M1 chart. Then, when the H1 is over, I watch the PA on the M1 chart and see which direction the market goes during the first 20 seconds or so to see if the momentum carried over from the last hour. All in all, it isn't much time to review the charts for me. -Jacob

--- 帖子 #391 ---
GBP/JPY looks good and will go more pips within the hour. Sure it will require more attention on your stops and money management. 4 wins, 1 small loss so far.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Lol, nice system! I agree with you in that price action is the best indicator (or indicators based on cash data, like support, resistances, etc). I noticed this system when I was studying candlestick patterns, but I never actually thought of trading this way. Sometimes a solution might be so simple that your subconscious mind tells you that it isn't a good solution. Maybe this is why we like to fill our charts with tons of indicators. Thanks

--- 帖子 #393 ---
well, personally, i think this will work. but not for the mentioned 10-&gt;20 pips. that's rubbish. you would need to wait for the close of the candle. i cannot say how many times you will win in say 100 tries. but the most important thing i can see is this: 1) trade only during market movement 2) you don't need to even win 50% of the time. even winning 40% of the time or less should yield positive results since your wins will certainly be larger than your losses. it is feasible that you may get whipped a couple times in a row, then one win will get it all back. i do have one question though. my question is, what is your psychology with one candle?? are you saying that if the price has been moving upwards in the last 60 minutes, that it is more likely for it to move up in the NEXT 60 minutes, but not the next 100 minutes? or next 120 minutes for example? what is your reasoning behind this? would it not be better to define an X amount of time that you feel it should keep moving up and then just close at that time based on say your computers clock?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
That's a brilliant idea Chiba-san. Can we expect you to do the research on it and present findings? In the meantime I will continue with the Master's original work and rules.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Why do you only show the profitable trades? Why not show all? Cherry picking does not make for profitable trading.

Tony....the guy who posted this system has not been on forexfactory for over a year......it seems like people have resurrected this thread .....and decided to trash it.....which I think is not really fair since the originator of the thread is not around to deal with it. I did trade this method for a while and it does have some merits. Specifically using M-candles, and scalping the beginning of the next 60 minute candle. I no longer trade this method....but it sure looks like Tony is/was a trader, trading real money. It seems that on Forexfactory we have lots and lots of "expert traders" who are still trading demo accounts PGPBP

Yupp. trade with the trend... That's it. Look for support and resistance watch out for market times... London open, NY open, news releases, London close, etc. Make sure you have a enough margin to ride out a swing or dip... pivot points...

Hi ...are you using bullish / bearish engulfing technique or bullish / bearish harami... looks to me the same.. quite risky. but may be a bit of help with bollinger band where when top of the band is hit we can confirm this entry type of yours... however no test we done for RR. pls help. Adious....

--- 帖子 #415 ---
well i sometimes used candle formation as an entry and target... however your system needs some filtering in determining true or false signal... to determine true/false signal i added a new rule as follow: - bearish/ bullish signal should started from fresh top or fresh bottom which follow by the same next candle (bear-bear or bull/bull) - the minimum target is breaking the top of the second candle (if it was bull) or breaking the low of the second candle (if it was bear) - the stop should be above or below the fresh top heres i filter your signal... it may help regards..

I like this system, but does anyone know of a way to filter because there are many candles that turn the opposite type (bullish/bearish) after the previous one.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
the best way to filter these trades is in a trend,plus also wait for the pullback but then again we are gearing away from the simplicity

--- 帖子 #424 ---
hi tony, thanks for sharing this quite interesting price action strategy to us. i would like to ask you about one thing, how do we take entry? is that so simple by just waiting on price moving bull/bear at 5 pips and then open position? is that any filter/another rules applied? thanks

this indi can be helpful but it does repaint.... so in backtest it looks perfect...............

--- 帖子 #427 ---
in my practice the best trend`s indicator is CCI_50 (Supertrend). you also may use EMA_5 + EMA_8. within the confines of Tonys system they work well all the best signals after pullbacks to the indicators lines. mean, the very first trend_color candle after pullback is a "signal candle". so may use stop orders to trade it

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hey tony, I think you have a very simple but effective system thanks very much for sharing it for everyone's benefit its very kind of you. Even so, I do not use it as per Instruction on the H1 . I use it on the H4, D1 and W1. Also my TP is much larger than 10. Basically I combined your Trading Style with pipEasy “Building an equity millipede” I highly recommend it for everyone to read. It will change the way you trade without Indicators Thanks also to everyone for participating

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Kjang, how exactly do you trade it?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Sorry to be a party pooper here guys but realistically the system will not work on the long term. 10-20 pip TP is too little when placing the stop on the other size of the previous candle as this is usually more than 10-20 pips. I might be stating the obvious but if a system so basic could really generate consistent gains and grow an account indefinately, don't you think the banks and big traders would just use a simple EA to follow this very system and everyone would be stinking rich? I'll get shot down for this no doubt but listen to me guys. Stop looking for an automatic follow the green light system. You need to actually use your brains to make pips in this business. Every trade is different and the market state is relevent to how you should go about it. The system forum is 99% nonsense and 1% actual credible trading advice. But sadly the profitable traders need the forex world to be filled with garbage systems to fool the newbies and hopefuls into risking their capital on some basic mechanical system that looks good on back test, to provide liquidity for the people who acually know how the market works. I have been there and done it all too, following amazing looking systems, making my own (dozens of them) and I was never profitable for more than a month or two until I realised it was time to delete all the garbage from my charts and follow price action. The M1 Stochastic is useful for getting a more precise entry when it's time to take a trade but most of everything else is just nonsense guys. Seriously. Give yourselves a fighting chance and stop looking for the holy grail or a magical system that will make money for you. Use the common sense to realise it does not exist. It can't exist. If it was that easy everyone would be doing it and the markets would cease to function.

Well. This is one example. I saw 2 Bullish candle on Euro/USD chart. So, I placed a pending "buy stop" order (22101904) at the high of the second bullish candle.(1.4002) and Stop loss at previous candle's low, which is 1.3965. My target profit Only 10 pips because previous post mentioned that you will have 90% chance to hit your target. See Chart 1 for my trade setup. I waited for almost 1 hour and check back my trade. Bingo! my trade was done and I made 10 pips profit. See Chart 2 for my trade history. The trade was trigger arround 2011.10.27 06:51 and done at 2011.10.27 06:53. I tried the system last time on demo account but this time is my real account. My lot size was small (0.01) because I got insufficient fund in my account. I will try it out again some more times to gain more confidient before I increase my lot size. Anyway. Thank you. Tony.

You still seem to be at the early part of your trading journey, in some way your right and in others your wrong thumbs up for the PA S&amp;R, study these well as they will never let you down, even when looking for the automated systems they will guide you what your missing is that you can have a simple system like this that will work, this is PA based - no indicators needed and it can and will win - just don't take every trade, study PA S&amp;R and this system will win. can automated systems work and generate 1000% profit in a month - look to trading comps like MIG banks F1 challange - they can and do make huge sums of money - but most will never be able to afford to buy them, when they can they no longer need to, because they have found there own way and enjoy the trading much more. most sytems can be traded, but more often than not people let it down, by not following the rules or second guessing the market - find something that suits our persnality and study hard and master it - remember exits good or bad are the key. would be good to see Tony back, but the arguments and lazy traders get to you in the end i guess. best of pips all

This system work great. I,m use 30- 50 pips tp on daily and 10-20 pips on h4 with multimeter confirmation. Thank you for this post

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I do not understand, the entries in the EURJPY, CHFJPY, AUDJPY and GBPJPY not follow the rules

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I live in spain, thank Tony, fxkill no rules!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Nice work what stop loss are you using and what of the indicators need to be in confirmation or is it all the indicators in the multimeter?

This style is basically the same as what i use except I use on daily chart and success ratio is at 80% or a little higher, however i use opposing candle to get out and breakeven at 40 pips.. Often get 150 to 300 pip trades and so thought i would share.. You cannot use robots or ea's with this technique, because with this technique you need common sense as well and a robot does not have it.. The two candle entry technique to work well one has to see candle movement down first for bull entry and move up for bear entry.. The waves of the market.. The market moves in waves, look at the daily, 4 to 5 candles down, up move, 4 to 5 candles up then down move.. Assess the wave even in trending markets there is waves.. Then use the two candle to get in.. Logic is needed.. One cannot just enter randomly on second candle anywhere like an ea.. Plus look at support and resistance for even more success.. My friend there is no such thing as a successful robot, they just cant calculate logic like what Tony says on first or second page.. And by the way tony, thanks for sharing your knowledge, I do not trade the 1 hour but will consider checking it out as well..

I beg to differ. Nothing you described here is beyond the capabilities of a well-written code. Programs can analyze data in as complex manner as you want. They can even learn to do it, if you want them to. Certainly, this is not something easily done and I can't imagine it being freely available because of that. But it is certainly possible.

the orginal signal candle alert does not work. to many builds since then. Easy system but the sl can get pretty big.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
You need to combine 2 tf's... h4/h1 daily /h4

--- 帖子 #444 ---
This system is easy to debunk. It's equivalent to flipping a coin only your odds are worse which is why Tony is no where to be found. If this system worked the guy would be the king of forex. Internationally known as the guy who finally figured out forex and the whole world would be using this system using robots to make millions. But no he is just another person who had a run of luck then cleared out, when his luck started going against him. That actually is what most of the traders on this forum do, while telling you they have been trading this system for years and doing it full time. You can debunk this yourself in minutes. Simply go back a few hundred bars and start counting. Count one when two bars occur and then minus one when they don't You will be shocked at how often 2 bars DON'T occur. In fact it may be better to bet on them not occurring! Calling it price action is just silly. All price movement is price action! Saying that you have cracked the code to how price moves then never being heard from again is ridiculous. Adding different time frames, other criteria like waiting for 5 pips to be reached, is all just smoke and mirrors to hide the fact this system stinks LOL Do you home work before losing money on this silly system. Count how often two of the same bar occurs. Instead of thinking like a gambler and having confidence after a run of winners because there is a bigger run of losers coming just around the corner with this system.

at least please show him some respect, and why not open your holy grail system new thread?

I keep reading comments like yours all the time, it suggests that one can seriously study forex to increase chances for success at it. My observation is: most traders are doing exactly what you're suggesting and it's also made easy to do so (brokers, forums, etc., provide free study material like webinars, ebooks, courses, whatever); however, more than 90% of traders fail at making money, so where does that leave your 'theory'. As a matter of fact, the more advanced traders honor the adagio 'keep it simple'... Making denigrating (even arrogant) comments like you did here, just shows your own limited, so called 'scientific', outlook on life and that's actually the best way to remain unhappy for years to come. Did you know that to this day, science can only address about 5% of the universe(s)? The rest is 'missing', so they call it 'dark matter' and 'dark energy'. Sure, they're successful in developing sophisticated machines (and gadgets), but they should get away from this idea that life is totally 'mechanical' and 'random' (evolution theory, explaining complex systems being the outcome of random events is just too silly for words). No wonder they're still treating cancer with chemo (highly toxic poison that kills ALL the cells of the body, not just the 'bad' ones - my educated guess is that most symptoms are part of the bodies own healing system, but admitting that would spell the end for the medical establishment, hence the lack of research into placebo/nocebo effect, spontaneous remission, energy healing, German New Medicine, etc.). Just my two cents, as they say :-) Cheers

Guys! I cannot load candle_signal. Help! thanks Happy pipping!

Hi This strategy still alive?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I like this system, it is worth a try i think

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Me to I like this system. So anyone tried back-testing it ? I do not see the template here or in the link as advertised.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
What this "system" propagates is horrible P/L ratio...laughable - profit 10 pips, stop loss 40 pips - that's beyond a joke. 0 candle patterns, 0 indicators - just "price action"...This is not a system, this is a trading strategy and extremely a bad one...and if I'm not mistaken I saw 99% success rate and 95% success rate, thats where I stopped reading.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Have a look at Dimdel's "Daily Green/Red Candle".

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I do prefer simple things, rather than 20 indicators system. So this one is something I really like. I'm new around but luckily with some programming skills. Second day with MT4 EA, but I can already make some scripts. So I can confirm what I see, don't need to blindly follow any magic strategy. EA finished for back-test this. And really great results for TP 10 pips / SL 40pips profit. Back-test for EURJPY, 1H, 2015: 40% win ratio, account balance -55% A little "better" results when counter (sell after two bull, buy after two bear): 47% win ratio, account balance -47% I guess this is why Tony is not around anymore...

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Any "system" which causes trader to take 10 pips profit while SL size is 0.00000000000000000001% larger than profit is not worth testing. Otherwise you would need more than 80% trade success rate over a very long period...In his best days it is said Jessie Livermoore had 79%, but that's just a rumor... Once I had (3 years ago) 36 consecutive trades with profit over a 3 month period. In the next 20 days I burned my account. Target profit NEEDS to be larger than stoploss size...otherwise your'e a sitting duck and the number of hunters with rifles around you grows exponentialy with each successful trade

--- 帖子 #455 ---
I hope Tony is fine and wisch him all the best, He wrote all you need to be in profit with this system. All the best in new year 2016. Many green pips!

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Haha yes, that's my plan in 2016. MANY green pips. I wish you the same! Nicely written yes, but without back-testing it's not really useful. So I still like this idea and not giving up. With better risk/reward ratio I think it could work. I need to find a way how to remove trades in the middle of a trend, those are burning it down. Need only a fresh new trend to open a position. Also I think it's a mistake to close the trade after a new candle comes. I have much better results back-testing when I let the trade live... (but not in profit yet)

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I trade only 3-4 first hours of london sesion ( Im from poland thats to me is from 8-11 a.m. ) and 2-3 hours of NY session, is better liquidity in market, thats works to me, and second rule I manage Take Profit, normally is 10-15 pips ( I looking for momentum, sometimes is 20-30 ) than cut 50% to my equity al rest 50% let run with 10-15 pips trailing stoploss. For me is better results. Sorry for my english 80% succes with this method is easy to make but... must! handle your emotions

--- 帖子 #458 ---
This is where I stopped reading and started countering it...he/she tested it (in live trading) for 1-2 days, had a winning streak and posted it as a "system"... "backtesting" implies it's 50-50, and with his SL size compared to profit, it's a burned account in no time.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Backtesting is a bullshit, you now that...

--- 帖子 #460 ---
there is somethings not right for sure. on a 1000$ deposit with proper Money management, the max loss and max profit must me much higher.. also how would it turn out if the win ration is 1:1 - spread meaning simply setting TP at exact the same as SL is to be and exit the trade if the following candle does turn oposite on close instead of waiting for SL to happen just some tought

--- 帖子 #208 ---
nice idea, i will test it, thanks bro

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I like simple systems like this one (thanks Tony!). Not so sure if more information equals more money though... More information takes the simplicity away from any simple system and opens the door for disturbing emotions (doubt/fear/greed...). Why not simply keep simple systems simple? :-) Keep your losses small (first of all, do no harm ) and move on to the next trade when price goes about 8-10 pips against you seems like a good rule of thumb here. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
stop distance is based on market-conditions, can’t just use a fixed number. at least the current atr in the timeframe you use should be considered.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Greetings everyone, is there any script which can be used to place orders Precisely 5 pips above or below the required candle Thanks in advance R

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I am looking out for amibroker file "candle.dll". Can anyone share it It is not there in my system. Can you upload it or mail to { email address deleted by staff }

--- 帖子 #213 ---
This system would be very effective by including the Choppiness Index indicator (attached below) to your chart to know that you are not in a ranging time. Go to youtube and search "Secret Swing Trading Indicator To Avoid Ranges (Choppiness Index Strategies)" by The Secret Mindset to see how this thing works (I have no association). I like simple systems like Tony's Two Candles and this would improve the odds.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
He also mentions using volume with choppiness. I use the better volume indicator (attached below) because I can put it right into the Choppiness Index window. Better Volume colors are the following: Blue -- normal volume Yellow -- low volume Green -- large volume by hedge funds opening or closing -- maybe a change in direction coming (I change this color to white) Red -- large amount of buyers over sellers -- will most likely change to bullish (I change this color to lime-- to me green means up) White -- large amount of sellers over buyers -- will most likely change to bearish (I change this color to red -- to me red means down) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Actually, if you use something like this with ,lets say, a Moving Average filter then you are putting the odds in your favour that this might work. I will admit I haven't tried it yet as I am working on something else but will keep it on the back burner for now and check here occasionally. Its easy enough to test.
