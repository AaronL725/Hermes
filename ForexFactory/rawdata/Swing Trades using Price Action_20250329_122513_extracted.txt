I began learning trading about 1999... By telephone and 56K dial-up modem. I started live trading 3 weeks after beginning to learn to trade... that was a big mistake in a way, but good in other ways. That account lasted about 4 months before I closed it... I'd lost over ½ of the funds by the time I closed it. I was a "momentum" trader, trading off 1 &amp; 5 min charts just using support/resistance and a 6 &amp; 12 ema. Nothing else. I traded eur/usd in the Asian session when Price was seldom trending. In the 23 years since then I've run the gamut of time frames, indicators, signal services, EA's and systems. I've been a fulltime trader on and off over the years. I've made a lot and I've lost a lot... up to 6 figures profit in one account which I lost back in Nov '07/08. I was NOT trading this system back then, and this is not my main system today... but I present it for your learning and study. This is one of the most simple entries you could imagine... and it is a VERY profitable system of picking entries. It returns 35-50% winning trades at 1:3 RR. At 1:2 RR it is over 65% on some pairs. Trading 1:1 RR you can expect 70-80% winning trades... on some pairs Extensive backtesting is necessary to find those pairs. It is your job to backtest... If I list the best pairs, you learn nothing. So what is the problem, why doesn't everyone use this? ... because it is Swing Trading... VERY little action. BUT... price is fractal, so these setups appear on lower timeframes too, it is up to you to test it on lower charts. ****** You have been trained to EXPECT action. ****** The Algorithim knows how to take your money My rules are very simple... Daily Charts with 8 &amp; 16 EMA's (it works fine on lower time frames, just more volatile) ONLY trade with the Trend... no trend, no trade! Wait for a Hammer, Shooting Star, Hanging Man, long wick Doji ... ( any candle with a long wick... the long wick must be at least ⅔ of total candle length ) . Wait for this candle to close. The long wick must at least touch or pierce the 8 EMA ... this is the "qualifying candle". Enter at the Open of the following daily candle. Place a Stop at the top (or bottom) of the qualifying candle. Take Profit point is up to you, but start with 1:1 of the number of pips of the Stop... if the stop is 150 pips from the entry, then you place a Take Profit of at least 150 pips. That's the basic rules. You'll get a trade about every 4 to 8 weeks on most pairs on Daily, and about a trade a day on hourly charts. Backtest, Backtest, Backtest on your favorite pairs, stocks, indices etc before committing live funds. There are more trades available by learning to recognize more setups... I have based this example on only one candle type... a specific "Pinbar". As you get more experienced at recognizing specific candles or patterns you can find many more trades. The EURJPY is a very good example There is a lot more profit in this method by taking partial profits and letting the rest run based on trend strength etc. Money Management and profits can be improved using alternate exit criteria like pivots, Fibonacci, Parabolic SAR etc. Another exit strategy could be to TakeProfit if Price breaks back through the 16 EMA, or closes back inside the 8 EMA. I suggest risking no more than 2% per trade with a personal account. On Prop Firm accounts I suggest a max trade risk of 1% because you can get 5 or 6 losers in a row. This is a very simple method using price action, an 8 period EMA and common sense. Please let me know your thoughts... Below are a few trade examples. For UpToDate back testing on several pairs go to Page 10 in this thread. For my trades in a $100k Challenge go to Page 18, post #342

Trade #5 was a loser, but entry was not until a few days after the setup due to the market gapping down over 100 pips the day after the trade set up. Nonetheless... a loser it is.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I like your system. I like simplicity in trading. I also like it combined with trend trading, a good risk/reward (better than 1:1), better than 60% win loss ratio (i assume you have about 75%) and your candle formations. All in all i believe you have a solid method that should perform well. I used to trade similarly on shorter time frame and to be honest the only thing really to change would be the MA's. I made them 20 and 30. Not enough action for me personally but i do like it. Juicyt

Looks good, pt. Looking at your chart, my only question are the candles that look like they should be trades, that you didn't take. There must be some other qualifiers that you didn't mention. Why not Nov. 19? Why not May 6? These are only a couple of examples. Thanks for posting your method.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Do you mind sharing the EA you are using ?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
So you're saying that if I were not in a trade right now, wait until the market closes tonight, (dailly close) to do what you say (rules) and if it doesn't do that just sit out another day and another day until it follows the rules. Just trying to get a system because I'm blowing the account

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I have always believed after 2 years of live trading that the way to go is the higher time frame charts. I am in.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Price action usually means Chart Patterns. Though trading with moving averages and taking aggressive trades can also be profitable.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
billbss: ... the Nov 19th candle does not qualify... the wick is too short. We are looking for candles that are strong rejection candles... wick twice as long (or more) as the body. ... the May 6th candle I missed. It does qualify and was a losing trade. In my example chart in the 1st post there were probably other trades I missed adding. One other point is that I didn't have the 16ema drawn on the chart. A candle piecing the 16ema is also a strong qualifier for a swing trade... some examples being Feb 12th, Mar 12th, Mar 30th, Apr 27th &amp; 28th however they often occur when the trend is flattening or reversing. currencyexch: ... use daily charts and wait for the daily candle to close. The time locally (for you) will depend on the feed your broker uses. Most platforms will use the New York close, but some use London or GMT. I prefer to use New York. For me in Eastern Australia that is at 7:00am my time. So after 7:00am I look at my charts for a possible setup. Last week we had trades on the gbp/jpy on 8th &amp; 9th jun, aud/jpy &amp; eur/jpy on 9th jun. This is a simple system, that takes no more than 15 minutes a day to check 12 to 15 currency pairs for possible setups.

Hi pt49, greetings from West Australia ! Re: ONLY trade with the Trend... no trend, no trade! How exactl y do you define your trend? Also the suggested trade 'qualified' on Dec 18th seems to me to be a "stopped out" trade and therefore a loss?? The pullback started above the TP at about 129.85 and then hit the stoploss?? Perhaps an extra stoploss of Close above the EMA would work? I haven't checked that in history yet ! Finally, I think this is a very good system, something I have been looking for, for some time. Thanks for sharing it here at FF.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
If the 8 ema is trending up guess what? Trend is up... keep it simple! You are correct, that trade would have stopped out after the retrace. I should have looked closer before posting.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Identifying qualifying candles. Shooting Star... small real body at or near the bottom of the candle. The upper wick is at least twice the range of the real body. Hammer/Hanging Man... opposite of the Shooting Star. Small real body at or near to top of the candle. The lower wick is at least twice the range of the real body. The "guru's" of candle stick trading will tell you that Shooting Stars, Evening Stars and Hammers and Hanging Man are indicative of reversals in the market, which is often true, but by using these candles "upside down" and "with the trend" we are confirming the trend and finding high probability profitable trades.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Here are the eur/gbp swing trades for 08/09... 5 trades for 4 wins and +714 pips.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You probably want to enhance these definitions. Using the definitions given, a 3 pip Doji will qualify. You'd need to zoom all the way in to see it.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Here are the eur/jpy Daily trades the last 12 months... 9 trades for 7 winners with 1 loss and 1 open trade and cummulative profit of +3,506 pips in profit the last 12 months.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Billbss... I would not use a small Doji (as in a spinner) as a qualifyer here. However a Doji that has a very long piecing tail is one I would take.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I took the eur/jpy Doji from Friday as a qualifying candle, however it is borderline as the tail/wick is not really long enough, still, I did take the trade today (BUY @ 137.70).

--- 帖子 #18 ---
So are these real trades?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
If you mean are these trades on a live trading account, no they are not, but I have started demo trading the method.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
very nice method and results keep going!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I'll give this a try, I need a swing trade system to try out. Nice job on paper trading before switching live, any good system starts out on paper.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Daily Swing Trade: I had a eur/usd trade posted here however I was looking at the wrong chart when doing my analysis... the eur/usd did NOT trigger a trade by my criteria... my apologies.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
"I now play around with an EA that makes a steady 1.5% daily" There's no need to do anything else but play on the beach..that would take 10k and turn it into 400k in one year. I'm surprised this tidbit is being ignored in this thread

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I've been asked in PM about the EA that I'm testing but sad to say it is not for public release so don't ask... sorry.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Not true. Taking $10,000 and making 1.5% daily would become well over $400,000 if you could compound your profits EVERY day, but you can't do that on a $10,000 account... Your profit the 1st day is $150... which is not a large enough increase on the equity to be able to increase the size of the 2nd day's trades. My trade size the 1st day on a $10,000 account would be 0.1 Lots ($1) and the account would need to get to $11,000 to increase the trade size to 0.11 Lots ($1.10), so you could not compound before about day 6 or 7... and even then it would have to be an account with 400:1 leverage... On the test I'm running I doubled the trade size after the account had doubled... which was at about 10 weeks.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
not to nitpick but that wasn't the intent of the post... the intent was that if you can make 1.5% daily, you are SET. maybe manually trade for Fun i guess. I could raise aLot of money to trade with if I could show that kind of return every day.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Swing trade today... Yesterdays Daily candle pieced the 8ema, is a rejection candle and the trend appears to have changed to up (the ema's have crossed for the first time since mid March). BUY usd/cad - 1.1321 Stop - 1.1227 TakeProfit - 1.1509

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hello pt49. I've been following your thread for two weeks now. Why do you give so much attention to the piecing lines of the candles, and what do you mean by "rejection candle"? The last friday's candle, as similar ones since thursday...can you explain it? Thanks for posting your system.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
hey

--- 帖子 #30 ---
PMGO... The last 4 candles on the usd/cad daily chart are "rejection" candles in a sense. The candle on: 16th June did not touch the EMA's (does not qualify). 17th June never had the long wick pointing towards the EMA's (does not qualify). 18th June had a long wick piecing or touching the EMA, and the trend is UP (indicated by the 8EMA being above the 16EMA)... BUY @ 1.1321 19th June is also a long wick piecing candle that also qualifies, giving a new entry BUY @ 1.1349 There was another entry on the Daily EUR/GBP 18th June ... note the long wicked rejection candle piecing the EMA's an closing back near where the daily candle opened. The trend was clearly down and the entry was on Friday's OPEN... SELL @ 0.8508 Rejection candle ... is a candle with a wick (or shadow) that is at least twice as long as the rest of the candle... it has tested support/resistance and retraced. It can be with or without a body (long wick Doji). The key is that the candle has a long wick. This type of candle indicates that price opened then moved through the daily range and retraced at least two thirds of that daily range back to near where the day opened. These candles are described as shooting star and hanging man. There can be others also... a Doji that has one wick much longer than the other and even what is called Railroad Tracks (2 candles) qualifies too. If you study the charts I have placed in earlier posts you will get the hang of what candles to look for I hope. I'm not the best at putting my thoughts on paper or in a post, so if you have any other questions... fire away.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Examples of trades not qualifying... eur/jpy, aud/jpy &amp; chf/jpy - 19th Jun ... a good candle on each pair however the EMA's had not clearly crossed at Friday's close (down trend not clearly established). Another reason not to sell was that the 3 candles from 17th to 19th all had higher lows and higher highs. While this is not part of the method rules as laid out in my first post, common sense tells me to be wary when looking at those 3 candles as a group.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hit TakeProfit for +188 pips .

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Seems like the 8 and 16 are good ma's for confluence as well, especially when you get a double test to the highs and lows or close then start watching for spikes and breaches(rejection candles) of prevoius daily candles once these ma's cross.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I apologize, but I don't understand what you said.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
IT is a nice strategy. I remember trading with a similar strategy, based on bounce of price off Moving Average. And objective backtesting results?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I've been away from my computer so missed a BUY trade entry today. BUY usd/cad - 1.1539 Stop - 1.1439 TakeProfit - 1.1739 As price is still close to the entry (only 30 pips above) I consider it still to be a good trade, as price could still come back to the entry yet. ** EDIT... price did come back to the entry of 1.1539... so the trade is valid. The only other pairs that had good candles on Fridays close were the NZD/USD which did not touch the EMA so no trade and the GBP/USD which did touch and piece the EMA however the trend lines are flat, so no trade.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
A good filter maybe to enter the trade on break of the qualifying candle's high for longs and qualifying candle's low for shorts

--- 帖子 #38 ---
In your rules you state.. Place a Stop 2 to 5 pips below or above the wick of the qualifying candle. Do you not place the order 2-5 pips above/below the close of the qualifying candle? I am not sure exactly what you mean by above/below the wick...typically ythe wick would be in the opposite direction of the entry.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
He meant place a stop loss a few pips beyond the wick of the qualifier. The stop not the entry. You enter at candle close and stop just beyond the candle wick.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
JuicyT is correct... below the bottom wick (of the qualifying candle) on a BUY trade, and above the top wick on a SELL trade.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
There are 2 trades I can see today based on daily rejection candles at the close of trading EST (New York). BUY aud/usd - 0.8081 Stop - 0.7977 TakeProfit - 0.8279 BUY eur/usd - 1.4082 Stop - 1.3978 TakeProfit - 1.4280 There was also a good candle on the usd/chf but the trend is flat.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I'm sure something as simple as this could be coded as an EA... any takers? I don't write code, but I do know how to trade I think.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Come to think of it, a simple system should never be coded into an EA. Simple sytems are for simple people... and we (who are simple... or CLEAR thinkers) are the traders who are hopefully part of the 5% ---- !! I did High School in the early 1960's and only got to year 11 and failed, then became a farm labourer, timbermill labourer and general non qualified bum of life. Somehow I self-taught myself to use a computer (initially about 10 years ago) and ultimately Forex trading... via my UNCONTROLLABLE interest in gambling in all shapes and forms. I still believe in the KISS principle... simple is Best!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
For example of simple... I have posted 3 trades in the last few days and one of those is down 35 pips... HOWEVER the other two trades are up a combined 110 pips.. a net 75 pips plus on those 3 trades.. if I was tired, nervous, scared of losing etc... I'd close all 3 trades and be happy with my 75 pips profit for the day. BUT ... we won't do that WILL WE? No! We'll stick to our plan... and wait for our trades to hit our Stops or TakeProfits!!

Looks like E/J will be a trade today.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi PT... On the EU long I have marked the entries and SL according to my data feed. My question is on the first page you stated trade with the tend. It appears the 8 and 16 EMAs are rather flat. So do you define the trend as "long" as long as the 8 is above the 16? I would say the same thing about the AUD long, trend is flat.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi loophole.. Again I would say the 8 and 16 EMAs are on top of each other so we haven't really re-established the trend yet. If we're following the rules wouldn't this trade have been triggered long on the June 30th candle? PT...would you take this set up long?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
No trade... the candle body and upper wick are too long (or lower wick is not long enough).

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Dave... the trend appears flat in your screenshots, however 2 days ago when the qualifying candle closed the trend lines were both pointing up, but now with 2 bearish candles the trend is flattening out. Maybe we should use a longer period MA to define trend, but if you do that then the trend is very much still Bullish, as seen with 50 EMA.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi pt.... It's difficult to determine just how to define a trend and when the market is flat or changing trends it gets even more difficult until the market reveals itself. I like the 8 and 16 cross and I also use the 50 as a general longer term trend direction. The only thing I can say about the EU at this point is it has been in a 400 pip range for about a month. Once it breaks out ..we will be in for a wild ride.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Assume a long trade. Everything look good for entry except the size of the wick that is above the body. How long can the above the body wick be for the trade to take place. I understand that the below the body wick should be twice the size of the body for the trade to happen. Can you give me the same kind of guild for entry with a big above body wick?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Loophole... As stated in the rules... the long wick must be at least ⅔ of total candle length . If the long wick is below the body then its going to be a buy trade and if the long wick is on top of the candle then it's going to be a sell trade.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Nope... the doji candle never had a lower wick long enough and as you pointed out... no trend.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Stopped out on the usd/cad trade for a 100 pip loss. On my personal account I had closed the trade out in profit yesterday when I entered the eur/usd &amp; aud/usd trades because with those trades I was hedging the usd. The other factor is the ranging market we are in the last few weeks... I figured that as the eur/usd and aud/usd are slowly trending up (usd weakness) the usd/cad logically should start trending down. Lo and behold today the usd weakened and the euro and aussie trades are now positive with the usd/cad going bearish... note the outside engulfing candle on the Daily close. This is a very bearish signal for the usd/cad. I've gone short the usd/cad on my personal account based on this candle. This is not a trade based on my rules at the start of this thread... I'm merely pointing out what I see as a probable change in the usd/cad market.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
If I understand this method correctly, then EUR/CAD should be a buy at the open of today's daily candle.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Correct Loophole... I was not watching that chart myself. The eur and aud trades from 2 days ago stopped out

--- 帖子 #55 ---
As the markets have been moving in a sideways channel the last month or so I've not posted any trades. I have only seen a couple at all, both on the AUD/JPY pair... but being away I missed them. They were on the 16 &amp; 17th July. Over 250 pips profit to be had, and made easily, although you may have been sweating bricks on the retrace on the 17th, however it did not stop out, and in fact the candle on the 17th gave a second entry (if you had the equity to take it). The candle on the 22nd didn't qualify as the lower wick was not at least ⅔ of the full candle.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Has anyone tested this method on 4 hrs tf? Regards

--- 帖子 #57 ---
OK - It seems like this thread is dead - Was worth a try.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Looking at this using the hrly TF and just taken a GU short. A clear and simple strategy.

Hi ! There's life - Yeah! Which strategy you using - The original one on this thread and/or PAST or just the original ?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi - i'm playing around with the same strat as per this thread but using the hrly TF for setups instead. Daily/weekly too slow for me.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
With ya - Thanks for the shout!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Great trading method, beautiful. But I'm not one to encourage bottle feeds so in using this method pay strict attention to the daily close price if you feel the need for more trades-other than that it is a method that can generate some very nice profits. One could also add engulfing patterns coming off the 8ema in the direction of the trend. Then the inside bar can be added to the method. All up its great- don't buy into resistance or sell into support- and don't over trade. I have used a very similar method over the past number of years and back testing this one looks a whole lot better. Congrats on this one mate and all the best.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
do you sell into support very often?

@pt49 Would it be correct to say these are trades you would not take - although we have the trigger candle, the EMAs are not showing us a trend - they have just crossed and could be considered flat, not pointing up/down to indicate trend?

As I said in my original post on the trade, I was not confident on the trend, so I never placed the trade... The trend looks OK after the event, but at the entry time, the 8ema looked to be levelling out.

No, I was trading a simple inside bar setup for the IB Maximizer. I have not traded that live account for a month or so now, as I have been studying the free ICT youtube channel... "ICT Mentorship 2022" . I highly recommend the ICT method... it is hands down the best free OR paid trading methods available ANYWHERE. It may take 6 months to "get it" but once you see it with backtesting you can't "unsee" it.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
You take your profits where you are happy with based on your backtesting in TradingView using the Replay option. You should NEVER follow anyone elses trading method without backtesting it yourself. Backtesting using TradingView Replay trains your brain to instantly recognise your setups. Trading is all about training your brain in recognition and controlling your emotions through risk management. You can set SL and and TP and forget, or you can set SL and manage the TP manually (requires sitting and watching the trade... not practical for swing trades )... but ALWAYS set a StopLoss . The 3.69% was where the price had moved to when I took screenshot.

Sorry, I have not been active in the forum lately as I am staying overseas in Bali... checking out "Cost of living" to see if it is feasible to live here instead of in Australia. IT IS DEFINATELY A REAL COST EFFECTIVE place to live. Western style meals in hotels and bars are 40-50% the price in Oz... fat juicy Pork Ribs with salad and chips (fry's) $12aud (in Australia would cost $25-$30) Eating local meals in warungs is far cheaper... $2.00 to $4.00 for filling very tasty stir fry chicken/pork and fresh vegies and rice/noodle meals. Full strength beers 330ml Bintang bottles cost $ 2.80 to$3.20 at the table... 30% of Aussie prices. Rental accommodation varies greatly. $15 to $100 a night... but book for 6 months stay and get at least 50% off. I can easily live in Legian in Bali for under $200aud a week if I decide to come for a long term stay... insurance will cost extra (and is mandatory, depending on your age and health challenges).

Hello! Been reading the thread a bit and think its really interesting. Question: How do you deal with correlation? Do you usually just hope in all trades you see or do you only trade one currency at a time? I have noticed that often when there is a setup on example eurchf, there is also one on maybe eurjpy and eurnzd. Do you take all the trades or just limit yourself to one?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Two setups that are valid I believe AUDNZD EURCAD

--- 帖子 #144 ---
The AUDNZD trade is debateable, I would not have taken it because the trend is not clearly defined as bearish... price had been ranging for 2 months in my opinion. You need to backtest using the "Replay" option in TradingView. It takes on 10 to 20 minutes to run thru 2 years of daily data looking for setups. Record the setups you see in a spreadsheet, noting how risky you see the trend etc. Do it for each pair and you will train your brain to instantly recognise good setups after a while.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Your USDCAD trades are very valid setups. Well done.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Obviously you must be careful trading correlated pairs... example... EURUSD AUDUSD CADUSD If you traded these 3 together you are basically trading the USD.

Hi Pt, Do you use any software to assist you in learning your price action? Or you purely just run through your EA and keep tuning the params until you are profitable? i used to just blindly tune my EAs without learning much about the candles. Now I'm using some software for backtesting where I can run through the historical candles and place my trades. At least now I'm really looking at the candle formation Wana understand how the gurus are learning. Thanks guys

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I am not using software, I manually backtest using the "Replay" function in TradingView. It only takes a moment to look at each daily candle as you click forward on the chart. You can check 12 months daily data in just a few minutes or so... you learn pretty quick which candles to check to see if it qualifies.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Swing trading is probably not suited to Prop Firm trading accounts unless they allow you to leave trades running over weekends. You could use 4 hour charts instead of daily... price is fractal, so it should still work ok... I have not backtested this though. Even scalping may work on lower time frames... test and find out.

Just a note to whomever, almost 2 months live trading this method. 2:1 RR, and I’ve won 13 of 35 trades. daily charts.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
35 trades in 2 months? It seems like a lot of trades. August is usually a hard month in trading due to it being summer holidays in North America.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
some were off the H8, some off the weekly. But yes, more discretion could be used :-)

--- 帖子 #155 ---
im confusion, did you trade only daily or multiple time frames?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
What date did you start the backtest? Would be interesting to do the same test and see if the results differ

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Feel free to publish your results, whether in spreadsheet format or other. I have not backtested other timeframes in depth myself. In my opinion if you only had 13 wins from 35 trades (live trading I think) then you need to test more.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Very interesting system! The numbers mentioned in the front are crazy good considering the ev of each setup is basically 100% of the risk taken. Example: (.5*3) - (.5*1) = 1 EV of 1 unit, risking 1 unit to make 3. Has anyone backtested to validate these numbers?

These are my results so far this month targeting 2R, I do set my stop to Breakeven when i'm in multiple trades that are correlated

I'm joining the party a little late but I like this strategy. I will be posting setups. There are a few things I would tweak however. From the first thread, these are the main rules Daily Charts with 8 &amp; 16 EMA's - I will be using EMA14 &amp; EMA200. ONLY trade with the Trend... no trend, no trade! - YES Wait for a Hammer, Shooting Star, Hanging Man, long wick Doji... (any candle with a long wick... the long wick must be at least ⅔ of total candle length). Wait for this - YES ! Daily candle to close. - YES The long wick must at least touch or pierce the 8 EMA ... this is the "qualifying candle". - YES but either EMA14/200 Enter at the Open of the following daily candle. - I will be looking for a better entry that I hope Asia/LN open would trigger. Mainly just runs of the latest High/Low or Fresh Sup/Dem. Place a Stop at the top (or bottom) of the qualifying candle. - I will place stops at the sup/dem the candle is reacting to. Take Profit must be at least 2:1 of the number of pips of the Stop... if the stop is 150 pips from the entry, then you place a Take Profit of at least 300 pips. - ALL trades 1.5R. I also follow the 1-2-3 pattern for structure. But one change in 1-2-3 pattern doesn't mean it's a change in structure as it depends where it is going to but just gives me visual cues for the structure. ( https://pipbear.com/price-action-pattern/1-2-3/ ) Outside of those strict rules I will have discretion on what setups to take and ignore, and hopefully I can make better decisions over time with some feedback from others. The HTFs take away a lot of the noise that confuses direction and this entry mechanism or "setup" is very straightforward. This is a long term strat. REMEMBER THE MARKET IS A MECHANISM THAT TRANSFERS WEALTH FROM THE IMPATIENT TO PATIENT! ANY and ALL CONSTRUCTIVE feedback is welcome!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
To get things started. Here are two setups that came last night. I AM NOT in either. EN: MN - Structure up (last 1-2-3 pattern was upside) and last month was bullish but no real momentum to the upside W1 - Again structure is up but last week was strongly bearish and EMA converging but we want to see divergence. D1 - We can see on D1, the EMA200 held as dynamic support the previous times price came and it held up pretty well. That zone holds liquidity. We can see the trade would have worked out but for me it's not strong enough due to the weak trend (as we can see from the EMAs) and the previous weekly candle. UCHF: MN - looks very bearish. It tried for 1-2-3 to upside but failed and pushed down hard. W1 - Again very bearish. D1 - Bearish with nice EMA14 rejection Overall not a trade for me. The reason is the daily. We are bearish and we have had a nice retrace up which could be the 2 leg of the next 1-2-3 down but I can't quite say why I don't like it. I just don't like it.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Last night GJ was valid but I didn't take it. We can see the current daily candle retraced before going up and on H1 there was a nice demand zone to target for entry. It was nice because coming into NY close price was going up. Therefore nice chance of a retrace during Asia. I did think about this one quite a bit and decided against it due to the daily. MN: not valid in this case. W1: Nice engulf showing upward momentum D1: We have just crossed the EMA14 and are still below the EMA200. Also the 1-2-3 patterns on D1 were to the downside and just printed the first to the upside. For this strategy, I am looking at strongly trending markets only. We had a very strong down move and it's not clear what will happen next yet. All three I have posted here would have worked out but I actively chose not to taken any. In hindsight, UCHF was 100% valid and there was no valid reason not to take it. I have noted this and will make sure it doesn't happen again. As this is a new strategy, it will take time to build observations around the strat. Any feedback or another perspective is welcome.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
GN from last night. Technically a signal but not valid for me. W1: Completely flat D1: Looks flat to me too and 1-2-3 patterns going down. We had one to the upside but no established trend.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hello friend... no, that candle doesn't qualify.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thanks for the response! Post the MT4 template you use and I'll use it. It doesn't matter to me which template I use. My charts are MT4. My aim in posting these charts is to swap observations with others.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Can you tell me if this method can only be used on the daily chart? Can I get consistent results on lower trading cycles, looks good, need to review and verify.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Lower the TF the higher the noise. Yes H4 can work and maybe so can H1 but will get a lower winrate and more noise. A daily rejection is more powerful than a H4 rejection which is more powerful than a H1 rejection. You would need to backtest to collect stats.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I am verifying it, still need more samples and data. The results look pretty good.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Cool, feel free to post H4 setups that you might be considering once you've done your analysis. I am only tracking on D1, but the theory is the same for all TFs so the observations would be useful.

For anyone interested here is an indicator that can help with back-testing and catching the signals live.

@pt49, I appreciate this thread. A lot of trading strategy threads tend to morph into something with completely different rules and more complications than beginners can handle. While there are plenty of price action ways to trade this, forcing the focus on long wick dojis and daily charts only is a fine way to instill patience from the beginning. Beginners can learn a lot here. I believe patience is the key. It took me more than a decade to understand that. Once you master the patience, everything else will fall in line.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
First trade on this strategy. MN down to D1 all bearish. D1 doji rejection of the EMA14. Looking at H4 there was a nice range down. I entered off the last high that was created before the daily close. I have tightened the SL to almost B/E as no need to leave any risk on the trade at this stage.

Maybe something wrong with either yours or my computer time settings, I don't know. jakartamafia charts are different to mine also Some of his qualifying candles are NOT qualifying candles on my charts. I have no idea if somethings wrong in my settings of Tradingview or not.

I think I found the problem... the data feed... jakartamafia has FXCM and I have Oanda for audnzd. FXCM is not available on my TV for audnzd

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Your EURJPY trade 3rd Nov is clearly NOT valid. The tail is way too short. May be something wacky in your script.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
It's all make sense now! That's why I love it when you suggest to trade this in the higher timeframe, it also reduces the risk of the difference of broker. Fun fact, I even don't trade on FXCM or OANDA neither. Thans for bringing this to my attention. Regarding the EURJPY 1H (at least on FXCM) / I got the point and notice maybe I perceive the rules differently. Will do check the code later on It should be correct. Open 159.801 ; Close 159.830 ; High 159.862 ; Low 159.711 ; Body size (close - open) is 2.9 pips. And the whole candle (high - low) size is 15.1 pips. So the candle size is around 5x compared to its body. Is it a wrong one to be taken?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
This candle highlighted yellow is it. The the body and top wick is clearly more than a third. The long wick is clearly less than 2 thirds.

You are using different entry rules to myself. IMPORTANT!! I enter the trade at the "Open" of the next candle (or near as I can, using Market Order). By entering at qually candle high or low is sometimes costing you a lot of pips. OTHER TRADERS reading be aware of this.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I am aware of this since I believe stop-order helps me to "not-chasing" trades already running (psychologically). And at the same time, it gives a pinch of extra edge. It opens a trade in the direction of our favour. And with the rules, the wick should cost us an extra couple pips. And as far as I understand, I am more than happy to pay this premium for extra edges. Lastly, take a look at this kind of situation. Not always, but can be prevented.

Done updating! Thanks for your time in evaluating my script. Appreciate it. Here is the new one https://www.tradingview.com/script/w...9-by-Cuancuan/ Attached Image (click to enlarge) Anyway, even though the broker data feed may differ, I think the edge of the strategy is still there. It proved one more evidence that this strategy has an edge and is robust.

How far back have you backtested your Strategy... it is quite different to mine. I have proven a 78% winrate on one of my pairs using a 1:1 risk:reward ratio. This is backtested from 1st Apr '23 to today 14th Nov '23... 60min charts. 119 Trades for 93 wins... over 4 trades per week on average. Longest losing streak: 3 Longest winning streak: 11

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I think the data feed is irrelevant as long as you stay with it. What I make on the swings, you make on the sways... so to speak. I use FXCM on all but 2 pairs which I use Oanda because no FXCM.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
This is how trading veterans operate. Backtesting with hard work to get the strategy data. Learning something here

--- 帖子 #225 ---
EXACTLY... my testing shows me the pairs to trade with highest winrates (70%+) and pairs to avoid (less than 70% winrate). It will take you time to backtest, but doing so reinforces belief and reduces the number of "Pairs" you trade. Trading too many pairs results in too many opportunities and over-leveraging your account... and forces you to pick which trades to take, and inevitably you will pick the loser... its karma. By backtesting and collecting data you will find only the "Best" pairs to trade. I suggest at least 80 to 100 trades backtested to get a reliable data set... regardless the timeframe. I have isolated 3 FX pairs with OVER 70% winrates at 1:1RR on 60min and one with over 70% on 4hour.

Let me ask, does this indicator notify when there is a pinbar? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
pt49 , do you wait for the EMA8 to cross down the EMA16 before looking for short entries and vice versa?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
have you tested the winning rate for lower timeframes such as the 30 minutes?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I don't but then I've been looking at these setups for a while now. AND I have backtested about 500 trades by now and I am confident in what I'm looking at on the pairs I trust. I enter based on the 8ema and will enter as long as the ema8 is not FLAT at candle close ON THE PAIRS I KNOW.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I originally used this as a daily trade setup, but I am now backtesting on the 1 hour charts and 4 hour charts. I'm seeing about 100 trades a pair in 6 to 8 months on 1 hour charts, and about 40 trades in 10-11 months on 4 hour. All the "Guru's" will tell you "Price is fractal" meaning that price patterns repeat over different timeframes, but because a Youtuber parrots the same bullshit as other guru's doesn't mean any of them know WTF they are talking about. A 75% winrate on 1 hour charts does not necessarily equate to a 75% winrate on 4 hour or daily on the same pair, so you MUST backtest each timeframe separately .

--- 帖子 #232 ---
It is possible to do it, if you subscribe the paid version of tradingview.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi pt49, great work and sharing. The trend might change over time to other pairs, how do you evaluate and move to other pairs when the win rates is below 70%?

You found 100 trades on each of 7 pairs? Or did you find 100 trades over 7 pairs? What risk/Reward did you use?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Sorry, wasn’t very clear. The total was 100 trades over seven pairs, not 100 trades per pair. I am using 1:2 risk/reward but also testing a trailing stop with the same data. Going to test 2 more years before deciding what to do next.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
A way I'm going to use the data is to see if there are seasonal trends, good or bad. Being a very simple entry model, you would think it would be consistent over 130+ trades in 3 full years on a forex pair... but it's not.

Been backtesting H4 timeframe for a week now and will post results below. Have used the indicator provided by jakartamafia with different settings applied to see if this made any difference. Years: 2021 &amp; 2022 Pairs: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, AUD/USD, USD/CAD, NZD/USD (7 Majors) ALL SETTINGS ON - 108 trades - 33% WinRate = BE P&amp;L SLOPE ON - 138 trades - 30% WinRate = -12% P&amp;L SIZE ON - 144 trades - 35% WinRate = 6% P&amp;L NONE - 198 trades - 34% WinRate = 3% P&amp;L Fairly disappointing results altogether for the amount of trades taken. Not sure if I should test 2023 next or different pairs or just move up to the daily timeframe like pt49 suggested in his original post and try again. Could it be that this strategy dosen't work well with the majors? Anyone else have results on H4 to share?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
There is an issue that I don't understand: If I bet on the H4 time frame, do I need to check the D1, W1 or higher frames to synchronize the trend? Sometimes H4 is for buying but D1 is a downtrend

--- 帖子 #249 ---
You make and save your own template in TradingView as depicted below... and when in doubt if a candle qualifies you simply apply the tool to the high and low of the candle in question. The top wick and body should be within the top ⅓ of the fib you have drawn, and visa versa for a bearish candle.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I don't use a bias based on longer timeframes, but you could I guess... whatever floats your boat. I now just enter based on if the 8ema is sloping up or down, if it is flat at the close of qualifying candle, I ignore the entry signal. The example below it was unfortunate but if you have a set of rules you must follow them. You based your rules on past experience and if you back/forward tested 100 trades you should trust your rules.

Thank you for sharing the "Thirds" fibo setting. On the previous XAUUSD chart that I share here, the 8ema does not touch the long wick and sloped down with 16ema. Yet, it gets the RR of 5.74 at TP.

You need to draw up a set of rules for your strategy and backtest it extensively.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Thanks for the input! You're absolutely right about the importance of a robust strategy backed by a set of rules. I've been actively working on crafting a solid framework that aligns with my trading style and risk tolerance. I've been diligently outlining specific rules for my strategy, focusing on entry and exit criteria, risk management guidelines, and indicators to guide decision-making. It's a work in progress, but the aim is to create a structured approach that I can consistently apply. As for backtesting, it's definitely on my agenda. I believe in the power of historical data to validate and refine a strategy. I'm in the process of extensively backtesting to assess how well the strategy performs under different market conditions. This step is crucial to fine-tuning and ensuring the strategy's reliability. It's a meticulous process, but I'm committed to this approach as it lays the groundwork for more informed and calculated trades. The goal is to build a strategy that not only performs well historically but also holds up in real-time market scenarios. Have you had any specific experiences or insights while crafting and backtesting your own trading strategies? I'd love to hear about your approach or any tips you might have found useful along the way. Thanks again for highlighting the importance of strategy and backtesting – it's an integral part of this journey! Best regards, deaftrader

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thanks Niko... I have not tried your EA/indicator so I can't give an opinion on its worth. I back test manually in TradingView, and only use metatrader for placing live trades. I have more than 1 pair with winrates over 75% with 1:1 r/r on all time frames (the best being 78% over 122 trades on 60min chart). Manual back testing improves your trading 1,000% more than relying on an EA. An EA can give you a lot of data in a short time, but how do you know if the data is accurate compared to real time trading, if you have no saved data from real time trading to compare it with?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Entry BUY on EURJPY daily time frame today... I'm in this one live.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I understand. I have a particular flaw, whenever I do manual backtests of more than 100 operations I self-sabotage, my eye easily picks up winning operations but sometimes has difficulty picking up losing operations and sometimes even ignores some losing ones. This is why I only trust backtests done by EAs

--- 帖子 #261 ---
OK, so did your EA give you a: Buy on eurjpy daily today? Buy on audusd hourly today? Buy on gbpjpy hourly today? If the answer is "No" on any of them, there's a flaw in the EA.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
You say you have a flaw... psychological/mental obviously. How do you know that the EA has no flaws? To help overcome personal flaws, you need a clearly defined winning mechanical strategy with written down rules that you back/forward test manually. To overcome EA flaws you need to find whats wrong and fix it. Run your EA on the Hourly eur/jpy from 1st jun '23 to today .... If your EA matches my manual trades you should have found about 84 trades with 70% win rate at 1:1 risk.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I’ll test that time period with the indicator method too. Did you check every H1 candle or only the ones where you would be awake? If so, can you confirm the times you only took entries?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Every candle, its mainly backtest. Some recent forward testing, BUT for data collection... EVERY candle is seen.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
OK - thanks. I've just run this manually through the same date range on H1 using 1:1 but using the indicator from jakartamafia (with all settings except 33% rule off). Want to make it clear that I am not trying to discredit either pt49 or jakartamafia - just trying to find something that works for me and is profitable. Using the indicator, I found 35 trades - 17 Wins = 49% WinRate. So something is a bit wonky here and puts into doubt the other trading/backtesting/results I had previously. Need to try and get to the bottom of this but not sure where to start...

I would not be anticipating a pinbar so far out from candle close.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Please be aware that the 8ema repaints as the new candle forms after valid entry candle closes sometimes. This only happens when there is a strong move up or down on the new candle. It can affect what you may see and record. For instance it can pull the 8ema away from the qualifying pinbar, leaving the pinbar NOT touching the ema. Another point is the data provider... I use FXCM charts on TradingView if I can... Oanda may paint a shorter or longer pinbar, for instance.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
there was no good entrance. Tell me, does the direction of the wick matter to you?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
For analysis, I only use mt4 charts of the broker I trade with. when determining the trend, you suggest EMA8 or EMA16. I noticed that sometimes EMA8 is up and EMA16 is down. what are you guided by then? Is the overall appearance of the chart or do you follow the price or is EMA8 the most important?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Following are 8 examples of trades in the last 6 hours... mostly all occurring 5 to 6 hours ago. Quite obviously it's hard to enter so many trades at the same time due to available margin... and these were ALL on the one hour time frame . This is why it is important for you to backtest at least 50 (preferably 100) trades on any one pair, to pick out just a few pairs to follow. I follow over 20 pairs BUT I only place trades on the 3 best pairs at present... based on my back testing . I missed all these trades due to not being available at the time.

You don't get many trades on 4 hour and less on daily. The one hour will produce about a trade a day on average, per pair. The direction of 8ema is the most important . At the start and end of a trend the 8ema will change direction first, which is what I now follow. If 8ema is flat or almost flat I reject the trade. At first you may find it easier to use both. All the 8 trades posted earlier are on the one hour charts.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
The LONG tail of the wick must touch or pierce the 8ema , NOT the short wick. Occasionally the entire candle may pass through the 8ema. A bullish pinbar must touch the ema from ABOVE. A bearish pinbar must touch ema from BELOW.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Thank you for your answer and your time, it should be enough to start testing.

I am glad to be on board with the wick pattern! It's indeed a fascinating indicator that provides valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price reversals or continuations.

8EMA slope I record/take a trade based on trending 8ema (sloping up/down). You may require more slope, or you may wait until 8ema crosses the 16ema. Whatever you do or use, BE CONSISTANT... your job initially is to collect data on a large number of trades using exactly thye same entry criteria. You can refine your rules later, after you have at least 100 trades data on the time frame you prefer for any one pair..

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi. With my broker on a funded account, EURUSD was within the entry criteria. 3 transactions ended profitably. We'll see how the day ends today. After historical analysis of charts, I noticed that a long wick, a strong trend without visible corrections, works best. then a candle with a long wick can be treated as a correction. secondly, if the preceding 3 or 4 candles are in consolidation, it reduces the chance of profit, it may mean that the price has reached strong resistance or support.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
2 entries from today, trades still open. I wanted to draw attention to my mistake that I noticed a moment ago. I opened trades on inversely correlated pairs, so practically it can be considered as one trade and then the set % for the trade is too high. my mistake

Today was a bad day. 2 SL, 2 BE and two open transactions are also in the red.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
It's part of the trading cycle Bro. You get good and bad parts in the cycle. After backtesting multiple pairs and finding a pair and timeframe that produces near 80% winners and then deep diving into that pair for 150 consecutive trades only to find that it averages out at just over 60% is quite sobering. The killer is the long runs of outs that occasionally occur for whatever reason... 10 to 13 straight losers in a row. Obviously then, risk management may be more important than trade selection. While it's euphoric to trade 10 to 12 winners on the trot, it is quite disheartening to hit 10 to 12 losers on the trot. This is where your psychological attitude comes into play. A weak mindset will see the trader seek out a new trading strategy and simply end up more and more confused. This is why backtesting for years back is needed to buffer the mind against self doubts etc. NOT auto or algo testing... it MUST be manual trade by trade testing, WITH recorded results... the data collected will be invaluable to you in the future. Example was yesterday... quite a few setups to choose from and the one I chose lost the full .5% risk I had on the table.

Not a bad 36 hours or so in BTC.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I don't have selected currency pairs yet, so I'm entering all pairs. I don't know which ones are best for this strategy. I know that I need a larger selection of inputs because I have too many Sl for TP.I'm wondering what other entry criteria to use to increase the winning percentage. When entering a setup, I always take a screenshot and describe from 1 to 5 how good I think this setup is. On Saturday, after one week, I analyze all entries. I think this is a good way to learn the strategy.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I focus on XAUUSD trades with my own RRR compounding template . I like this strategy (8EMA &amp; 16EMA) as its simplicity.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
One pair is not enough for this strategy. There were 35 transactions on gold this year in H4, including 22 winning ones, which is 63%. of course according to my criteria. I still need to check H1. Does he use RR 2:1? I divided it into 2 TPs 1:1 and 2:1

--- 帖子 #307 ---
First thing in the morning I scroll though 20 fx pairs plus BTC, Gold and Oil... I go through all pairs in the Daily, 4hr and 1hr charts. When I see a setup, I place the trade on my chart with the TradingView buy/sell thingy with stop at level of the end of the long wick, no set TP. Then every hour I go through all pairs in the Daily, 4hr and 1hr charts, and update them. When I feel like it, I will backtest further into the history on my most promising pair... I'm concentrating on backtesting the hourly's first. Last night I made a crude Google Sheet and entered EVERY trade on my favorite pair that I have recorded in TradingView from 6th Mar '23 till yesterday. 1 hour chart 135 valid trades, 99 wins... 73% wins with TP at 0.5 of risk and 65% with 1:1 risk (TP at +1). I never delete them ... that was the start of my Data collection. I just wish I'd been doing it for years... but better late than never.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
BTC is not my fav pair but I had to take this... the reentry after the stopout was based on a break and retest into a bullsish FVG. The 1st entry was a bit over 2x, and the open trade has hit 10x but still running. Combined over +3% so far on my FundedEngineer Challenge which was 6% down.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I explained why I reentered... it was NOT a pinbar entry.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
These are my setups from today. 3x SL. (yesterday 4 SL) everything seems fine. EMA8 is broken, we have a trend, the candle is larger than 2/3. but something must be wrong. My efficiency is about 40%. maybe because I'm playing against the main trend, does it matter? does anyone have an idea?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi, all three charts are in a clear downtrend. So I believe we will have a better chance with bearish pinbars.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
On 4H chart, I saw that both EMA did not touch the candlestick wick. After checking all TF charts, I followed the uptrend on 15M chart as the combined EMAs touched on the top of uptrend candlestick wick. I placed the BUY bias at 2043.80 to hit the RRR 2. Normally, I follow my RRR setup template (TP: 10pips, 20pips, 40pips). I sometimes see the opportunity and go for more than 40pips TP.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Today I analyzed M30, H1, H4 Gold, and I already know where I am making a mistake. It's not about entries, it's about money management. in the H1 time frame, winnings reach up to 66%. RR 2:1, i.e. exactly as written in point 49. This strategy is very profitable, but without good risk management and a trading plan it is unprofitable. I see that I have been in trade for 2 years and I still have a lot to learn. a good strategy is less than half the battle. Is there anyone who can help me create a good trading plan?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Pick one pair, backtest it for AT LEAST 100 trades on a single time frame (day, 4 hr, 1 hr etc). Record the winning trades max profit. Then filter your data for 1:1 wins, 1:2 wins, 1:3 wins etc. With data you can build a risk plan for that pair and time frame. Without data you are lost! How you manage risk is determined by your risk appetite, which is influenced by your brokers leverage, AND whether you are on a Prop Challenge or a personal account etc. 5% risk per trade on a personal account may be manageable, but even 1% risk is regarded as max risk on a Prop Firm Challenge.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
ONLY trade with the Trend... no trend, no trade! On D1 chart, I saw the 8EMA &amp; 16EMA moving up further since they changed the trend due to their crossing each other at the candlestick. I went for BUY trades.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
So I did. This is very difficult and tiring because the brain subconsciously searches for profitable transactions. while viewing the same chart for the 3rd time, I still noticed SL transactions. the results are surprising. currency pairs that I thought were potentially profitable were not. thanks for the tip, without data it is impossible to build money management.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
The main trend has no meaning. you need to do historical analysis. Without this data you are lost.

Your charts would be easier to read without the watermark on them... just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Backtesting is where you must spend most of your time while developing your trading plan, and this will take months. If you insist on being in live trades while developing your plan, then trade only 4 hour and daily... this gives you plenty of time to do it. If you are trading hourly or shorter time frames you will not backtest because you will be all the time watching your trades.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I appreciate your feedback about the watermark on the charts. I'll consider your suggestion and explore ways to ensure the charts remain clear and easily readable without compromising their integrity. Your input is valuable, and I'll work on enhancing the readability of future charts.

Does anyone know of any good and ideally free backtesting sites/apps for traders where the backtesting doesn't require programming? I'd like to backtest strategies on different markets such as buy if RSI is over 30 or say 20 EMA crosses 50 EMA or fibonacci retracements etc. I have looked at Metatrader and TradingView but both seem to require coding. Forextester seems to be a possibility, but it's quite pricey. I don't need it to be glamourous just need it to show trades and profits.

When you take multiple pairs you MUST be aware that ALL of them can be impacted by the same fundamental news. Say you trade 5 USD pairs (usdjpy, audusd, bgpusd, eurjpy, eurusd) and an adverse news event comes out impacting the USD... In my back and forward testing its likely that you could get 3 or 4 entries in the hour or so before, leaving you over-exposed to the USD.... bad news event occurs and BOOM, 3 or 4 trades die instantly. The opposite can occur also giving you 3 or 4 trades running in wild profits. If trading multiple pairs try and make sure they are uncorrelated... that can protect you from these swings.

what EMA are you using? maybe I have it set differently?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
EMA8

--- 帖子 #330 ---
that changes a lot, thanks buddy

One thing that can make your charts different to mine is your Data Feed... I use FXCM charts where I can. Oanda , Forex.com and others may draw slightly different candles to FXCM, but should balance out over time regardless the data feed your charts use. Sometimes you win, sometimes I lose.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I don't understand one thing, I spent dozens of hours on historical analysis. I understood that the most important thing in this strategy is analysis. I have all the necessary data divided into months, the number of SLs, the number of SLs occurring one after the other, etc. I follow the entry criteria, everything looks good in the analysis, I enter the market and everything breaks down. what am I doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
That's easy on TV, right click on chart to access the Settings. It shows the changes on the chart as you make them, really helps if you find the Watermark distracting or use various background colors. Cheers. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Are you talking about Daily candles? If so, please share some setups and we can help analyze, otherwise very hard to answer your question.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I trade on H1 candles, do you also trade this strategy?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
There are a lot of indicators in TradingView to display various watermarks... the most popular appears to be AG FX - Watermark

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Dear All I tried to code the strategy. I do not get positive results in long run. I do not find any errors in the EA. Feel free to test the EA. I would be glad if we can discuss the results of it. Best hundsbua

--- 帖子 #338 ---
What TP did you implement? Did you implement RR 1:1? OP wrote: "Money Management and profits can be improved using alternate exit criteria like pivots, Fibonacci, Parabolic SAR etc. Another exit strategy could be to TakeProfit if Price breaks back through the 16 EMA, or closes back inside the 8 EMA.". Perhaps try these?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
It looks very nice method keep going!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I just added RR in this first version. Good idea , I try to add this options you mentioned

--- 帖子 #341 ---
If anyone is struggling with it, go back to the opening post and study it slowly, thyen back test it on each pair in various time charts. I'm using 1hr, 4hr &amp; daily. I have manually back tested NOT using any stuff like Strategy tester and such. At least 500 hours minimum of work... candle by candle. At loeast a year of work spread out overt many years. Every time I got tired of it or frustrated, I simply stopped doing it... one time for 5 years, and I went training Greyhounds to make some money... I trained just over 400 winners in Darwin, Australia in a bit over 5 years. I could have used back testing software, but you don't train your brain that way, all you do is save time.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
NOW... to prove this works I am attempting to pass some Prop Firm challenges. I started a FundedEngineer $100k challenge yesterday. So far 1 trade, for 1.20% win. I need 10% to pass phase 1, then 5% to pass phase 2 and get funded. I'm posting my trades on "X" formerly Twitter and in my private Discord that I'm using as my journal... I copy and post as soon as I can after I enter. My "X" handle is @savco My Discord is simply my journal, and for my record only instead of writing a manual journal. I recommend using Discord as your journal... go to Discord, open your own server (free) and copy your screen shots of trades and add a comment as to what happened, your emotions etc. Everything is saved in Chronological order. I'm trading GBPUSD daily , USDJPY 1 hour &amp; EURJPY 1 hour . Being in Australia my trading sessions are Asian, London and some of New York AM.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi pt, Very interesting strategy, keen too test this. Was wondering how you have your EMAS set up and if you could explain these briefly? Regards, The Bands

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I don't have time to run/test your EA hundsbua, but others may do so for you hopefully. If your charts don't match mine it is probably because of your data feed. My charts are from FXCM , if you use Oanda or Forex.com they can differ slightly... especially 4hr. My 4hr are outa sync with MT5 due to MT5 being located in Asia somewhere, maybe Russia or Cyprus. It should not matter on 1hr and daily though... what I miss on the zigs, you win on the zags.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Yesterday there were a few trades I noted, and one that I traded. GBPUSD 4hr... loser https://www.tradingview.com/x/6ceIdqeA/ GBPUSD 1hr... loser https://www.tradingview.com/x/P0NJfcyy/ USDJPY 2 trades... 2 wins https://www.tradingview.com/x/UH6TtzOb/

9 winners straight on this pair in 2 weeks. https://www.tradingview.com/x/LDtemVq6/

This is the post the lazy traders wanted to see... those who will not succeed. In trading this I am using TP of 1:1 risk to reward. In other words, if my wick is 35 pips, my stop is 35 pips, and my TP is 35 pips also... so my TP is equal to my risk, 1r. Obviously, many trades go a lot more than 1r, but the more profit you try to get, the more times you will lose the trade. LAST 12 Months USDJPY... 1hr charts. 191 trades for 127 wins at 1:1 r:r in the 12 months to 17th Jan 2024 . Taking 1r profit yields 67% win-rate in my back and forward testing on the usdjpy 1hr... - Longest winning streak 11 - Longest losing streak 4 - Worst period Jan to Mar 2023 - Best period Nov 2023 to the present, mid Jan 2024 Blind Freddy makes money with those odds. If you are not willing to do the work in back and forward testing ANY strategy, you will NEVER make money trading. I 1st began working on this strategy 15 years ago, when I was 51 years old (I'm now 76 y/old) ... take a look at the date of the opening post on page 1... success takes time. Am I successful with trading this? We will find out in the next month if I can pass some challenges.

Initial results on my $100,000 FundedEngineer Challenge, Phase 1. 2.8% on closed trades 0.9% on an open trade (long eurjpy 2 lots, TP at ). So approaching 4% Equity in 2 days.

I have not tested the Aussie a lot, but this looks a good entry with 3 consecutive setups https://www.tradingview.com/x/mcEDPn0v/

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hello pt49, May I ask. For this trade, it's a 1 TF H1 chart trade? Or are you applying a HTF (eg D1 or W1 to get a HTF bias first)?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I don't bother too much about Bias... if the 8ema is sloping up or down, thats my Bias. I recommend adding the 16ema for newbies... if the ema's are separating that gives you a bias. If the 8ema is FLAT when the qualifying candle closes, I won't take the trade... any sort of a slope, I take the trade. It can be confusing when the ema is flat because it repaints and shows a slope if the next candle moves fast on opening. You get a slope where there was a flat.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Got it, thank you! If EMA flat, it means price doesn't know which way. So better stay away

--- 帖子 #353 ---
sometimes it happens that EMA8 is flat for a while. 'the price is resting' and after this consolidation there is a continuation with a very good R:R. as the author wrote, without backtesting it is impossible to trade this method effectively

--- 帖子 #354 ---
My transactions from yesterday and one from today. 50k challenge, 0.2% on transactions. all profitable. The 3rd and 4th photo shows the "price rest" and the continuation of the trend. I confirm such inputs on the higher TF, it often happens that the pinbar is also created on the higher TF at the same time

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hej, my backtesting set up is on mt5. Would you mind sharing your code, so I can transform it to MQL5? Or can you do it yourself? Thanks

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I'm having an EA built for this Strategy, my man is backed up a bit with work, so it may take a week for him to get to it. I'm no fan of EA's but I want to test this on multiple pairs incl indices and futures on multiple time frames. That amount of testing involves lot of work, way too much for this old man.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
In the first 18 days of this year the usdjpy, 1 hour TF,has had 15 trades for 12 wins at 1R risk. 1R means if I risk $100 with my stoploss, I make $100 with my TakeProfit.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
How does FVG play out in your strategy? If you don't mind

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I don't apply them to this... well, I hadn't even thought of it. You could use fvg's and OB's in setting TP's if you trading larger r:r's. That's worth looking into, thanks for that idea.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Don't mention it. I happen to see your chart, has FVG printed out by ur indi.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
when trading in the 1hr time frame do you still call that a swing trade? the post generally was about swing trading but I am seeing alot of comments on talking about another type of trading.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
That is FVG indi from Nephew_Sam that i still had open. I have studied ICT concepts quite extensively. I find they have too many rules myself.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I originally styled this as a Daily TF Trade setup. It works on any time frame though... but not condsiodtantly on all pairs. Some pairs are exceptional Daily, others are better results over 4hr or 1hr. It is up to you to backtest and discover which pair and TF suits you. I don't care which TF I trade, though I find it difficult to trade less than 30secs, because I do my entry's manually... and it takes at least 30secs to place an entry, stop loss and TP manually. I'm not able to change the thread name from Swing to Day trading for example. It is what it is.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Dear hundsbua, I sincerely appreciate your dedication in creating this EA. I am eager to test it and would be grateful if you could incorporate an alert feature (push notification) into the EA. My intention is to attach the EA to various currency pairs and monitor it closely when the alert is triggered. Thank you in advance for your assistance. Kind regards, neilpryde

--- 帖子 #365 ---
(hundsbua sounds pretty Bavarian - or Austrian - to me) remarks: (the method is close to the inventory-retracement-bar-method, which has been proven to be profitable many times) a) does it use the entry signals as trend-following signals? b) if it isn't profitable you probably have a problematic definition of "no trend, no trade" (see post 1); i. e. your method to determine bias is problematic

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Yes, I agree your strategy is much simpler. ICT has external Liq Grab -&gt; internal Imbalance. Many a time, I get analysis paralysis.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
i've backtested a few hundred times, surprisingly very accurate, but a good pinbar setup is very rare, like once every 2 week for hourly timeframe per currency pair

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I think you didn't understand the entry rules.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I'm very close to having an EA to serve up these entries... excited here.

this candle is not good for entry. does not meet the entry criteria. and SL is too big.

For more in depth study follow this link to The Trading Game server in Discord. The Trading Game is a very fast-growing Discord community with many free and quite advanced trading strategies. An advanced Indicator has been developed by one of the members, which I have thoroughly tested... it is very ACCCURATE at isolating Valid Qualifying Pinbars.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
so share if it’s not hard for you. indicator for everyone!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #374 ---
The indicator is for the Trading View platform. It's called cd_Russell_Strat . More details are shared via the Discord link, so I suggest checking it out.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
How I setup the cd_Russell-Strat indicator in TradingView This removes the background shading and the 16ema... up to you if you do the same. It's important to have the Repaint option set to "NoRepaint'

--- 帖子 #376 ---
There is a lot more than my Strategy at The Trading Game Discord... It is free to join, and there are many Strategy's to explore, without any financial obligation. I am beginning to test a new one that has over 90% win rate named RobinHood .

I can't find this indicator on tradingview

After several months of testing, I can confidently say that this strategy does not work! don't waste your time on it. The author tells the same fairy tale on Discord. The author is looking for attention, nothing more. I was removed from Discord for these words. If you say it works, show your statment!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Discord has reached 4,000 members and is now closed.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
You can't help stupid I guess.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
After 77 years putting up with idiots in this world, I don't seek attention young fella. ... my best advice to you is to just get a job, and forget about trading. No amount of indicators, EA's, training and mentorships will help those who are too lazy to do the work to develop their own Strategy and trading plan. Personally I have moved on to Futures Trading and this strategy is not good with my broker Apex Trader Funding because trades must be closed end of day (5:00pm NY) I am now $550,000 funded with Apex using just my knowledge, trading 1min and 5sec charts... and adding more $50k PA's till I have 20. Goodbye.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
For those disbelievers out there, this is what 25 years studying has given me... I've bought 26 $50k evaluations with Apex the last 2 months, and I've passed 11 of them, giving me $550,000 funding. These are not traded using the Swing Trades Strategy, as it's not suited to Apex rules of closing all open trades at 5pm NY every day. I'm trading Apex using a new Strategy I developed myself while in The Trading Game discord the last 4 months. Shown below is screenshot of this months trading (1st May - 22nd May) , and another showing the 11 PA's I've acquired so far. 8 of those accounts are now each eligible for $2,000 payout ($16,000).

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Honest admission coming in from left field... and a lesson on when not to trade. I eventually became funded with 20 PA's of $50k with Apex... total $1mill. I qualified for payout on 8 accounts ... total $16k. Before payout approval I was diagnosed with a Cancer and tilted a bit in my trading. That "tilt" caused my balances to drop below the payout drawdown level, and I was denied. Over the next 3 or 4 weeks I lost all 20 accounts due to over trading and stupid decisions... mainly brought on by stress and maybe 10% by market conditions. I am still battling with my health and have not traded at all for about 4 months. Lesson: DON'T trade if there is stress in your life, whether it be personal or business.

Take care pt49, and GWS.
