Hello all. Simple scalping. Thought I'd share the strategy I use. Scalping suits me. I'd rather be out of the market more often than in it. 1 or 5 Min chart, Any pair, low spread. Bollinger bands 25:2:Close Smoothed MA 120 High Smoothed MA 120 Low The double MAs are handy when price is there. Stops you wondering where price is closing and gives a bit of a buffer. Direction- BB ma in relation to main MAs Sell off upper band TP lower band. Vice versa for long If market is sideways, still valid but better value when MAs start to trend. Keep an eye on major s/r (Be careful if your signal is at prev swing high/low.Here,a bit of Price action and price breakout knowledge is handy). If in doubt, its always better to leave it and wait for a better opportunity. These opportunities will crop up dozens of times a day. High impact news - Personally I stay out till its out of the way. SL up to you. Prev swing high/low is probably best. Less is more ! That's it. Good luck Please note. I will not be sharing any of my personal trades (aside from illustration purposes) nor will I provide trading signals. Your trades are your responsibility and yours alone. I am simply sharing a trading technique that has been successful for me.

dont wanna be rude but this system doesnt has any statistical edge to be profitable in long run

--- 帖子 #3 ---
None taken I don't try and get as many trades in as I can. I'm happy to sit in front of my computer for half an hour, an hour whatever waiting for a decent opportunity based on my rules. If one comes along, the trade rarely lasts more than 15/20 mins. I'm more than happy to take my 10/15 pips or whatever, close my laptop, get on my bike and go to the beach and come back later. You see this "system" is all about subjectivity. My trade is down to me. It's why it could never be automated into an ea. In any case, I've yet to see any ea work in the long run. The thing is, the old days of nice intraday trends have finished thanks to the ultra low commissions and HFT systems coming out of the east. In and out. That's it.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
For example a trade turned up on U/J right on London open this morning (9 am here in France) Only a small one , 9 pips net. There might not be enough meat on this particular sandwich for some, but I'm happy with that. Another "sitter" like that may turn up this morning, it may not. I don't care. In 10 mins I earned more money than I used to do sat all day on someones roof in blazing sunshine.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Color me surprised. This system looks like it works well in a trending market. Using somewhere near your chart did some backtesting selling only in the direction of the MA. This is ~48 pips in 4 hours with minimal drawdown. Will have to do so more testing but this system as simple as it sounds seems promising.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #6 ---
What other timeframes do you use for your analysis, or are you solely looking at the 1min chart? Also which pairs do you trade? cheers

--- 帖子 #7 ---
None at all. I do look at M15 to see nearest s/r above and below (I personally use the "trading in the buff" method for seeing that) and stick a line on the chart. That's it. M1 only.(That's not to say it isn't applicable to other tf's, just that I prefer to be in and out) Any pair is sound but because its scalping you obviously need your spreads as low as possible? I tend to stick to UJ EU etc as I'm with an ECN and for these 2 I generally get around zero spread and pay 0.6 commission.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Both charts are EURUSD M1. Currently just doing some manual backtesting around the current market environment and found a more realistic example. I am using the Heiken Ashi indicator since M1 charts can be choppy. In this example we have a 10 pip TP and a 5 pip stop loss for a 2:1 RR. We aren't in a heavy trending market, but we've just experienced a breakout. We skip any trades that are consolidating around the MA and try to find clear entries. Obviously I have hindsight (perfect entries) and no psychology weighing me down so this is still unrepresentative of real trading. Over the duration of approximately 2 hours, we experience 3 losses and 4 wins netting us 25 pips. Unfortunately this did require some discretion particularly at the +36 pip breakout because there was a bollinger band contraction, but price did not actually touch the BB. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So as xdj3richo pointed out, we would need to do some more in-depth testing to define an edge and see during what market conditions did this system perform poorly. Since this system is relatively straight forward creating an EA to do that wouldn't be difficult. Skimming through the higher timeframes, it looks like as long as you have defined a R:R based on the market conditions, you can use this system on any time frame. Thanks for sharing the system Jenx. Very interesting. I'll be following this thread for further developments.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Nice to see. To be honest, it takes so much subjectivity and as you say, discretion, that I doubt an effective ea could be created on it.( I doubt any ea has ever been profitable in the long run in any case). One "tweak" I had thought of incorporating was using the M5 to refine the bands as s/r. But I don't expect too much from my trading.I can fund my lifestyle and that's all that really matters to me. I've been doing this too long to chase the Ferrari. Thanks for your input and look forward to more. Cheers

Would be awesome to see a few of your live trades Jen

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Firstly, its so basic, there isn't a great deal to see. Secondly, in what way would it help? I didn't share my technique in order to prove anything. I'm not selling anything. I spent years losing money, watching colours change and lines cross over each other. If only back then I'd realised less was more. This thread is purely me sharing a simple way of trading that I have found. Nothing more. Good luck

--- 帖子 #12 ---
sorry if this is a dumb question. so when the price is action is above the simple move average you buy at the bottom of the bollinger, and when the price is below you sell at the top of the bollinger? Ho to work out your stop losses?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I am looking forward to tracking this trading method. I will post a few charts later today.

USDJPY 1 Minute chart: Orange boxes for buy entries .

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Sorry just replied but didn't scrub out my acc number on the pic! Basically this was about an hour ago. Green line was about where I had the S/L. I had missed the earlier one but as that hadn't really gone very far I was happy to get on it so soon after I took 10 pips. Clearly more on the table but you don't know that at the time. I don't really get hung up on ratios but everyone to their own.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
EURUSD 1 Minute chart: Entries so far. Update: 10 pip targets both hit on these 2 entires. Very little heat take on each other these trades.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Jenx , Try file --- save as picture.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
On UJ I have 108.75/86 as possible solid resistance, and given the big gap back down at 107.85 I'd be wary of taking any more longs till we see what happens. If it turns, theres a few pips to be bagged on the way down no problem.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
on m15 i see the next R around 109.40 and the S around 108.50. how do you spot 108.75/86 as a R? by the way nice thread! thx!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Look at the big spike

--- 帖子 #21 ---
On M15 this price was never revisited. ( see how the high of the 3rd candle never touched the low of the first ( arrowed). This means theres supply sat there (traders stuck long wanting to get off the ride). Narrow that down to the M1 chart at the same time and it gives us 108.86

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Do you look for s/r on bigger timeframes like daily aswell?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Not really as I'm scalping the m1 chart those levels are largely irrelevant. For instance, at the moment its looking like the 108.86 ish level I identified on M15 is being respected. So, for now, I'm bearish. But I must follow my rules. So I don't place any shorts until my M1 chart has flipped round. Of course, if the M15 breaks above that level and holds, then I'm long again.(That is until my M1 chart tells me differently!)

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Nice ti know . A nice simple system for Manuell trading. There is mich room for improvement but no need to. I really like that. Thank you Lets try that

--- 帖子 #25 ---
This a decent scalping system. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Jenx, Very simple, easy-to-follow system. Thank you for sharing!.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
yet you dont mind sharing your trades in hindsight

--- 帖子 #28 ---
One trade to illustrate to someone who' had asked a question. I took 5 trades today. It's irrelevant to this thread. I have nothing to prove. The strategy either works or it doesnt. You decide.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
oh ok thanks for the answer jenx. on one post you said the method is very basic , on another you said it requires a lot of subjectivity, do you mind me asking if you re profitable using it ? Also i dont get how/why you equate showing some live trades to having something to prove !! i mean it's not live a trade explorer or a myfxbook account was asked.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
And so it begins.

Brilliant System! Thanks for sharing it!! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is my initial attempt to try to put some code together to depict the system. Subject to changes as I learn more.

Nice long on the USDJPY as we move into the Asian session. This trade has been already good for 10pips.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I started this thread in order to share the very simple strategy I use for trading. Just because a simple strategy requires a modicum of common sense for it to work, doesn't make it complicated. I mean, at the end of the day, It's a set of Bolly bands and a couple of MA's. Not like I've invented the Hadron collider or anything. A simple system doesn't necessarily make trading easy. That's a different issue. You can put the simplest most effective system in front of someone but if they don't have the requisite trading psychology, they will never be profitable. Only one person is responsible for ones profitability and that is oneself. As I stated in the original reply,what benefit would there be from me sharing a live trade? The rules are there and very straight forward. In fact, sharing a live trade, aside from one risking making themselves appear conceited, may actually detract from someone else developing their own approach to the strategy. I hope that answers your question. Now, please, may I ask , if you wish to contribute would you do so constructively.? I wouldn't wish to see this thread go the way of so many others. Thanks a lot and good luck.

Amen &amp; Amen!

I have 2 friends trading a similar style. Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Don't wanna be rude but... it does. It's actually entirely based on statistics(Hence why 25 minutes, 2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS, Closing price). How do I know? Because I began trading with an almost identical 'system' based off of nothing other than the edge that's inherently built into it. Whether it works for someone else or not... well, that depends on how much experience they have with it and how well they understand it's edge. Side note to OP, I prefer Keltner Channels 30 : 1.5 : Exponential with 60 for my SMA High-Lows. I'd suggest trying it; a lot smoother than the BB. Trade on re-entry into the Keltner rather than trying to catch it on the BB deviations.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks for sharing, what best time frame to trade it?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thank you for sharing One question: What do you mean with "Keltner Channels 30 : 1.5 : Exponential"? I think Keltner Channel with period 30 and k value of 1.5 right? And expotential MA mode. Can you recomment or even share a MT4 Keltner Channel indicator with this input possibillities? Because in the one I have I can only change the period. Thank you

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Nice,Thanks. Just placed Keltner(30) over my template and seems to provide a nice filter for when price rides the bands and confirms the one time bounces also. However,it does just strike me as not much different to adding high/low ma's to the bb ma. As I'm a slightly aggressive trader, I tend to look for good value entries outside the bands. Of course, theres no wrong or right way. Very interesting.Cheers

In my opinion, due to the spread, even in a small spread pair UJ, TP should be not more than 5 pips in order to get a consistent positive result in 1 min TF.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
more than 30pips...done for the day. i watch only the four majors EU, GU, UJ and UC when i test something new i always try it with microlots... thx JenX for the interesting trading idea!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
USDJPY trade worked out great 4 Minutes for 5 Pips. Not much but the risk was lower^^ EurUsd 12 Pips and usdjpy agian with 10 Pips nice day

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I use the Keltner to find the meat in the middle and wait for the market to bite at it. It's just a visual aid. More trades; less profit. Waiting for re-entry reduces the risk of buying into a runaway down-swing(or it's equally dastardly sell/up-swing twin). I think it allows me to use more leverage than I would otherwise. I don't do too well if I risk 50+% on just the BB. I don't really use stoplosses because of the win-rate. I basically sacrifice all that extra room that would be between the Keltner and the BB as a way to offset buying into a bad swing that's really a surprise breakout/reversal. The longer it stays outside the Keltner without re-entry(with the obvious exception of false spikes); the safer it is when it finally comes in. The market can do what it wants everywhere else but the channel is my safe-space.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I coded an EA with the current rules, and it's certainly not profitable. One problem is that waterfalls in the adverse direction will kill any profit. Setting a stop-loss don't help either. So if you're profitable in the long run, please share the additional rules based on "psychology".

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Moneyfred have you red the thread?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
...this is a very good message

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Sure. Have patience and wait.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I don´t understand why people come hear, aren´t willing or aren´t able (I don´t know maybe both?) and than asking such questions and bother threat starter to proove something. I really dont understand. 1. Jenx wrote a view times, that he not trades all signals, but filters trades with support and resistance and PA (He also mentioned which method he uses to find supp and demand) - thanks therefore Jenx! It helped me a lot to find better resistance and supports areas! 2. No strategy can be traded mechanically without eyes and brain and than be longterm profitable! No system. Sorry, but please read the threat. And have a little bit of decency.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
no edge, lot of subjectivity, what do you expect ? mostly cherry picked winners only shown, this is typical ff bs.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
As I said from the beginning, I don't believe any EA has ever been profitable in the long run. Like I say, its all about subjectivity and discretion. Not buying into resistance , overbought conditions, news etc. It's about cherry picking the trades. Yesterday I had 5 trades, today 2. Sure, there have been dozens of opportunities but I chose the ones I was happy with. If I make 15 pips in a day, that's fine. If I make 50, better. If I want to go into the hills walking for the day, I won't trade at all. Greed will kill an account every time. This strategy allows trading in conditions exactly the OPPOSITE to which you are creating with your EA. That's almost my point. Cheers

--- 帖子 #54 ---
the edge is YOU. then go somewhere else to play and leave us here (serious traders) PLEASE alone. and also please EA traders...run as fast as you can!!! we dont want you here.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
For example, I have a small personal rule. I never take 2 consecutive trade opportunities. No reason why not, and more often than not the second would be just as profitable, if not more so, than the first. But it just stops me over trading. More often than not, if I take 12/15 pips , I'll go off and do something else for that session. That's just my particular "rule of thumb" There's no right or wrong way. Just whatever suits your personality and lifestyle. Good luck everyone and remember there's more to life than forex.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I doubt you'll get a reply as I have "ignored" him, which I think prevents him/her from commenting. I did ask them politely earlier in the thread, but as they say "Haters will be haters" Good luck

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Not entirely true. There is one system that I've come across that could be coded into an EA and is long-term profitable. Took me a little while to figure out what it's edge was(so that I could utilize it to improve my own system) and the strategy is sound... it actually accounts very well for that 'holy-grail' people can't seem to find. Is it perfect all the time? No... but it does have positive expectancy. That's precisely why I won't share it.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Than why you are here, if you have such a good EA which makes you money? Use it and keep it for you You will be rich man soon.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Jenx , first of all congratulations for your simple , clear and profitable system. EA s are the ruin of a trading system. It's the same old story : a guy post a system that work well , obviously in manual . The rules are clear and simple and the system, usually, is profitable. At that time comes someone who says: " Hey bro ! This is a nice system, why do not we make an EA ? " Here is the beginning of the end : the EA works sometimes yes and sometimes not , then guys change the rules which are no longer neither clear nor simple. All give advices : maximum confusion. The spirit of original - manual - system is lost . End of the story. Moral : Manual strategy with strict respect for the rules : all OK. Manual strategy transformed into EA : all KO.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
The dreams of riches grow stale and kill a traders account(that mentality obscures the reasoning necessary to become profitable). I'm here for the same reason someone joins a bowling league or a book club; I enjoy playing the game and I enjoy the discussions. If you knew how to cheat... why wouldn't you just play the game for the joy of playing it?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I think it's a good idea if everyone stays in a positive frame of mind and not get themselves in an argumentative situation. We all have our needs/ expectations etc sat at different levels. I think most of us are here to improve the way we trade. I personally am not looking very much further than the way I trade but then I don't expect/need any more from life than I presently have. I live in a beautiful part of the world with a lifestyle most would give their right arm for ( not through trading I might add) and I never take it for granted. So I think peace should be the operative word here and start helping each other rather than creating opposition.

Currencies are a commodity. They're a limited commodity. If everyone's rich then no one's rich and no one's poor and those without self control would consume to their heart's content in pursuit of a void they've been conditioned to fill out of greed. The key is to learn self-control and patience. Giving out a free shortcut isn't good for any of us. You'll appreciate it more when you realize you didn't want to skip the lessons. Think of it like this; I'm looking out for the rest of us by saving you from yourself. If you want it and you can handle it then you'll eventually get it. Maybe not for 10 years but you'll get it... and sometime either before or shortly after that it won't even really matter that much.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Jenx, for a Long trade off the BB lower band, do you prefer to take it on: first touch ? bullish close of the candle that touched/crossed the lower band ? close inside BB bands, but below middle band to give room for profit ? bearish close below the lower band ? any close of the candle that touched/crossed the lower band ? Thanks again, Khalil

--- 帖子 #65 ---
It depends. For instance if it fires well past, like 5 pips obviously I just pull the trigger there. If I get a pinbar I'll wait for price to retrace back down the bar and pause.If I get a solid close at or just over the band I wait. In any case I want an entry at or beyond the bands.Just my personal preference.Others may wish for a bit of confirmation. It all comes down to a touchy feely type of thing. I'd rather miss a trade trying to get a good value entry than sweat out a drawdown or have my stop hit from a crappy price. It really does come down to you. That's the subjective part. Same with tp.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Part of the advantage is your rule of not taking 2 in a row. Generally; if you have a good entry the next one is more than likely to be crappy. This IS a negative-sum game after all. I'm not going to get into the other reasons why not taking 2 in a row is a good idea for the strategy but there's more to it than just the aspect of controlling the greed. It sort of falls in line with what I said about waiting for re-entry because the longer it's out of the Keltner bands the less risk when it re-enters.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
excellent system.. I follow a similar system and consider the 250/500/750/Big round numbers to be natural SR levels (along with major SR levels based on H1 price action).. Jenx, thumbs up for sharing this.. also noted the discretion and the closing of platform after hitting the daily target.. thats very important... I also dont believe that a pure rule based system has ever been successful in a long run

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks Jenx!!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
is this true?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
thanks easy n simple system.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Yes, it is. I know him and we had spoken few minutes ago about this system. Very impressive indeed.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Simmer down now. There's still more to it that requires 'feeling'(which is more than can be encompassed mechanically with a simple system because there's a lot more that goes into it). That's his edge; this is just a basic starting point that can help someone lose less until they become comfortably familiar with it to start profiting. Basically, an EA would understandably fail with just these rules.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yeah, sure. I also dont't see an EA being profitable following just these rules. But, the results are impressive and the system seems to work as it should. Not saying that will be the same tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
It's a slaughterhouse when news impacts things or it unexpectedly stops bouncing on the MA. Today was a strong trend day; the market didn't whipsaw much so it would have worked well. You'll eventually start getting a better idea of the trades you want to avoid and the few golden apples that are no-brainers.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Just a heads up. Here is a M15 chart of U.J. The lines are S/R I've identified which may impact M1. The resistance we've just bounced off is the gap down that was formed on 01/09; A lot of supply would have been trapped there. Bearing in mind there was a similar gap up formed on this weeks open ( 107.85 ish), the direction change may be significant. Of course my main guide is the M1 chart watching those s/r lines whenever it gets there, but just be aware that gaps ALWAYS get filled. It can go on a long time without doing so but at some point it will get filled.( Don't get trapped into the ball game of trading back to a gap. A lot of accounts have fell by the wayside trying that. Just keep it in mind) Have a good day and good luck.

--- 帖子 #76 ---

Yes no problem. Below is a H1 chart on cable. The support lines are there. What makes them support? Well if you look where I've put red arrows, you'll notice that each of those bars comes after a period on consolidation. You'll also notice that the high of the bar was never re-visited by the low of the 3rd bar after. This creates a "gap" made by the 2nd bar.The wider the gap, the more significant. It creates support/resistance ,because what you have there are traders who have been left behind by the move. They're now sweating it out, and all they want to do is get off the ride. As soon as price comes back there, they'll unload their trades faster than a tramp on a kipper. That creates the supply and demand. This is valid on every t/f so you can narrow the "gap" down almost to the pip.

Ok, I get it now, thanka You were meaning trading naked PA. Sorry, English is not my mother language and it took me a while to understand your slang.

I'm not taking credit for this method of identifying S/R. I learned it years ago off a chap called John Templeton, and have used it ever since.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Congrats Jenx. Thanks for sharing to brilliant method. Only reminder, Scalpers should check s/r and trendlines condition ( HTF ) as Jenx said. And dont jump&amp;take all of trade opportunities. If ve not any trade/risk/money management plan, dont try to scalping. Stay green !

Nice work

Really a neat introduction and a super neat system. Subscribed Guido

--- 帖子 #85 ---
srcs76, thank you.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
jenx, are these 2 latest S and R lines of GU drawn correct?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Yes, they're fine on the M15. I tend to then drop down to the M1 to refine the level, so it then looks like this on an M1 chart

--- 帖子 #88 ---
i understand, interesting, thx!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Excellent Read, no BS, just straight forward common sense. Will play with it tomorrow, and see if I can win a few.

Nice and simple system. I think that with the right mm you can earn a few pips ;-) Ive downloaded the template from srsc i`ve got a question, in the right upper corner you see the name of the pair ( for excample EU/USD ) and a number right know -5,6 sell Can you explain how that works ? Greetings Erwin

Thanks very much for the thread. Will follow.

i dont get the keltner channel setting you mentioned properly can you please give a clear explanation on the setting you make use off

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Well I don't trade anything less than H4 but just this post is worth a million. Look at the attached chart, EURUSD H4 and see the arrow and then the check sign where price reversed after 247 pips retracement. Thanks for sharing this gem. Kind Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #95 ---
...and this week, same chart, same tf. Beautiful short with minimum SL, magnificent RR. Kind Regards, Blackeagle ps. I hope I got it right what you taught

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yes. I think its a much better way of spotting s/r than the normally arbitrary way which often just depends on how the trader is viewing the chart. In fact its extremely accurate most of the time. Funny you should write this as yesterday, with not much going on, I set up 20 odd H4 charts with this method of S/R ! What I have found is that sometimes you need to watch what happens at the high/low of the 1st candle when price returns. Obviously supply will be at different levels along that candle and if the PA struggles to go any higher/lower then the high low that's also good indication of reversal ( as in the last high on your chart). Good luck and glad you've found it useful.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Yeah, trading is simple. All you need is 3 things. 1. Trend 2. Signal to entry 3. Exit Fibonacci expansion is a great tool for exit, try it.

Thank you Juhanimi. Your charts looks quite interesting. Could tell us please, which indicators you use?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Keep that elsewhere guys, we have a thread and a template to stick to on post #1 Taken my first entry from this system - I need to be a little more picky with my entries. I entered early and price didn't close outside the BBs so it wasn't an optimal entry. Price did move in my favor for a little bit but failed to make new highs so I've decided to close the trade and walk away with a small profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Good morning Jenx, I'm quite new to trading and found this post very interesting. Could you please explain me how do you use S&amp;R lines for the strategy you explained? Thanks in advance, Luca

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Have to agree. I personally have no time for indicators ( yes I know we're using Ma's and bb's ,but that's just s/r identification). Believe me, I've tried them all, in all combinations. Fools game. Everyone is free to trade in the way they feel most comfortable and profitable, just indicators have never worked for me. Yes, I wouldn't have been in on that, as I'm a bit greedy and tend to try and get a price outside of the bands. Still, a profit's a profit ! Looking like a decent day today. 2 little "sitters" on UJ already this morning. Good luck everyone

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Jenx and Ivanyo: Yes, you are right. I also dont like to mess my chart with needless indicators. I was only interested to know which oscillator he used, because it looked really accurate. But no problem mate I have another question: How is it with stop loss? You said mostly you use the last swing low or high. How you do this exactly? Because when I try to catch a price outside the bands there is often no "old" high or low. And if I take the trade after confirmation, so when price came back into the bands, the actuall last low or high is so near, that it will be often hit. So, how far away is your sl often? Is it behind the double 120 moving averages? As I understood, you not too much looking at risk reward ratio isnt it? Thanks mate

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Yes, that 120 H&amp;L is good enough to spot trend, just wanted to show that how you can use Fibonacci expansion, it is a really good exit tool, and I think you did have not any exit tool, or maybe I just did not see that.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
That's the problem. They always look good in hindsight. Their formation was a result of price movement, not the other way round !! On the pic I've marked where I took the 2 small trades this morning and round about where I put my stop. Bear in mind, I won't sit there and watch it get hit. I won't think twice about bailing with a small loss if it looks like its going turtle. Again, that's a bit of subjectivity.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I just tend to close off once price goes well beyond the opposite band. I'm not trying to second guess how far its going to run. Hence why I only usually get between 9 and 15 pips max. I'm happy with that. Cheers

--- 帖子 #107 ---
and do you move sl to be, after you have a good profit, to save your trade? I think you babysit your trades right? So if price moves sharp back to entry, you close?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Not really. The bbs are my guide. If it drops and then bounces back without reaching the lower band I just keep an eye on it. If it looks like it'll fail, I just kill it. Thankfully it doesn't happen very often. Great thing about following the trend

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Just did my first live trade 0.10 trade and won 2.35, nice to get a good result off my first test.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Okey, that was funny.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Sorry, my bad, I was thinking that you get signal when price closes outside of the band. But I did read again and that is not the case.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Any tips on how to spot which pair to target?

--- 帖子 #114 ---
It seems to be valid on most pairs to be honest. I only look at UJ and EU for scalping because of the low spreads on offer ( my broker charges me between 0 and 0.3 on these 2 pairs with a commission of 0.6 pips) Quite important when scalping.

Another Winner !!! 2 out of 2 today, will stop now as USD news approaching.....

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi Luca Have a read of post #78. Its applicable on all timeframes. For this strategy I don't tend to look further than M15

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Read that, but that's how you find them. After you find them, how are they used in your strategy? Thanks in advance, Luca

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Wise move !

--- 帖子 #119 ---
You should share your trade with everyone so people can learn

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Only when price is at those areas I am careful.. I dont sell into support or buy into resistance. I wait and watch the pa on the m15. If it breaks I carry on with that trend, if it rejects , then the m1 will have invariably switched anyway. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thank you very much, Jenx!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
My simple contribution to this thread.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
That's very handy! Cheers. My coding skills are up there with my grandmas so brilliant contribution. Takes away some of the concentration Good work

--- 帖子 #124 ---
On UJ last hour or so. Shows why you should be wary when price is meandering around the MA's. Strategy still valid but not very good value. Best to sit it out and wait for it to make its move.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Read Post 1 over and over until you understand it. Read Post 78 over and over until you understand it. I then load 1m chart on EurUsd and also 1h chart on EurUsd (just so I can see how the market is trending or ranging) Be aware of where the 120 moving averages are on the 1m chart, and also where the support and resistance are. Then decide if you want to trade, it's up to you to make the decision.... If I decide it looks good to trade, I wait for the price to move outside the bollinger band, and then when it re-enters on a new candle I place my trade. This is the way I do it, everyone is different, plus I only did 2 trades, so I'm no expert lol.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Please your view on those arrows for a buy signal, thanks.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Not worth the risk, IMO if price is hanging around inside the MAs. Even though you'd have been able to get out at around BE on those, like I wrote earlier, its never really good value off the inside of MAs. That's sort of why I thought of the MA high/low thing as a buffer / filter .Obviously the 2 previous ( where you've ticked) were fine.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Took 9 on Eu short. Looked like a good entry at 1.1894 near the resistance area. Wish I doubled up on position and let one ride. Thanks Jenx.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Don't know if this is of any help to anyone, just to clarify. Here we have a valid buy signal but we are so close to M15 resistance ( green line is the low (gap start) and yellow line the high of that candle) that it really wouldn't be a wise trade. That's not to say it wouldn't work, just I wouldn't trust it. In any case we have big USD news coming up. Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Did I mark support with gap correctly? Cheers.

First one fine ( was filled 9 bars later creating demand) 10 bars later another was created, yet to be filled. Second one, not at all ( maybe on lower tf ?) Third one fine. Hope that helps

--- 帖子 #132 ---
It does, thanks a lot mate

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Jenx my friend. Since your from france,you tried the Dax index ? Looks great on back testing. Very low spreads . How long have you been trading this strategy ? Whats your weekly average pips gain? Kind regards, Goose

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Can you send mq4 please? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I'm with IC markets now and so far I'm quite happy with them.Good value for money. Mind you, I spent 8 years with Oanda so that's not difficult ! I've been playing about with this strategy for a while tweaking the bb and MA settings. Once I was getting consistent results I decided to share it about. As I wrote earlier, it depends on the individual trader and their own risk appetite, personality, approach etc. I tend to get an average of 25 pips a day. Some days 15 ,some 50 ,some days I have other things to do so don't trade at all. Having said that, I only take a handful of trades that crop up. Depends on you.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Was bored,cause having a little brake with trading and randomly found your thread! Was looking smthing familiar,subscribed and thank you for this thread. Will study now keep up the good work,be in green,cheers

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Well if you ever get into the dax. Prospreads are great. 0.34 spread. No commission. No tax. Direct access. No requotes.A broker designed for scalping. But its full lots. Also crude really good spread. Your strategy works well with that on one min.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Interesting. I used to trade crude a lot, but not scalping. Got fed up of the manipulation in the end. Of course that's not an issue for a scalper

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Yeah so prospreads spread is 2.25 spread for crude. As you know the moves are big with crude. Traded when liquidity is high. Your method does very well last week (all I checked)

--- 帖子 #140 ---
i tested the strategy and get 90% win rate.. so beautiful.. thanks!!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Jenx - great thread, thanks! Just setting up a chart as you describe on your first post. I don't use MT4 and my charting package doesn't have an option for 'smoothed' MA. Can you elaborate? Presumably you're not using not a simple MA, so maybe it's exponential or weighted? Cheers

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Would just like to add having knowledge of candlesticks seems useful. Gives added confirmation. I really like steve nison book Japanese candlesticks. When its hits a band and you get a reversal conformation with candlesticks,its really sweet to see. Im also checking order flow. You can't to this with forex. Getting a delta that supports your entry will be beneficial. These two things could give a better edge or/and added confirmation.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Thanks. To be honest, although its not a complicated system, it did take a while to refine it, and, using smoothed averages is pretty important to this strategy. If you compare it to a chart with say, emas, you'll see what I mean. A lot of successful signals suddenly turn into losers. Maybe your broker offers MT4? Most do. If not maybe you can download a demo account from a different broker and use that to give you signals? A bit crude, I know, but those smoothed MAs are pretty imperative. Cheers

--- 帖子 #144 ---
A 120-period smoothed MA will be totally different from a 120-period exponential MA, for sure. But it should be exactly the same as a 239-period exponential MA. The formula for "translating" a smoothed MA into an exponential MA is just "2n-1" where "n" is the periodicity. Put them both on your chart and see if they overlap completely? If they don't , then this isn't a standard smoothed MA but something different. Hope it helps!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Wow Karl that is impressive. As I have the same problem. No smooth on my charting provider. But how would I do close and open ? Any ideas ? Thanks you very much.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Sure... in a trending market with 100% of the moves in the same direction I suppose it might. It doesn't work like that though.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
240 ema = 120 smoothed

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Well, I think that if you look up how standard smoothed and exponential MA's are constructed and calculated, you'll find it should, Redeflect. If not, then sorry I wasn't able to help after all. Sorry, Goose - I haven't read the whole thread, and don't immediately see what you need "open" and "close" for? (MA's - if not specified otherwise - are usually constructed from the close, though I prefer the "typical price" myself). I thought you needed the highs and lows for this system? (I only saw the OP, sorry if I missed something else). For myself, I wouldn't worry about using just one line instead of two, if that's easier for you. It's going to make very, very little difference. As Jenx rightly says, when combined with "essential, basic price action skills" this method is going to have a genuine positive expectancy ("edge") because it's based on an entirely logical and sensible underlying principle. (No offense to anyone, but these wouldn't be quite my choice of indicator settings for it - but maybe that's just me. Anyway, commendations to Jenx for posting "a good one", here).

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Not quite: 239, actually. It's "2n - 1" (the difference is terribly tiny!).

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Yes, microscopic difference but I prefer a round number. EDIT: I forgot to thank you Jenx, for your kindness by posting your system.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
[quote=fxprimate;10291944]{quote} Yes, microscopic difference but I prefer a round number. Wow - some serious techs on this thread...! Be good if someone could try out the 120 smoothed and 239 ema (or 240 if you prefer.... it's nice and symetrical after all) next to each other on a chart and post it... to put this question to bed....as I wouldn't want it to detract from the real subject matter of this interesting thread.. [But thanks to Jenx, KarlKraus, goose4, Redeflect and fxprimate for your replies to my 'simple question'...!] Cheers

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hey KarlKraus - what variations would you suggest?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I'm a little reluctant to say! Jenx has recently tested it, and is actively trading it, and I'm not (I tested the underlying idea and some variables of this indicator-combination, many years ago, but not on spot forex). I know how irritating it can be when you post a system in a forum, especially one as promising and sensible as this, having been trading it successfully for quite a while, and along comes someone else who isn't trading it and starts suggesting all kinds of "improvements" to it, which very often turn out not to be improvements at all! And I don't want to sound disrespectful to Jenx! Having said that, personally I'd be interested in the combination of increasing the time frame a little while reducing the width of the standard deviation of the Bollinger Bands. I used to do quite well with this, on 2-minute futures charts, using a BB setting of 18/1.8 instead of 25/2.0 as shown here. You get more entry opportunities. But note that that does also reduce the reliability (win rate) which may be why Jenx has chosen these parameters, of course. I got around that by entering a trade only when a candle specifically opened below the lower BB and closed above it (long trade, when the MA/channel gave that bias) or specifically opened above the upper BB and closed below it (short trade, when the MA/channel gave that bias). So I was really trying to catch entries in the underlying trend-direction just after a retracement had turned out to be " most likely just a retracement rather than a reversal". I did get more mileage out of it, this way. I appreciate, of course, that M1 forex charts may be different from M2 futures charts for this purpose. As they always say "the devil is in the detail" and Jenx doubtless knows more about the detail and more recently than I do. That would be my instinct, anyway. (I did an awful lot of backtesting.) The underlying principle is a very valid one, anyway, whatever the instrument and time-frame, because everything is a bit fractal, anyway. It's one of the best methods I've seen posted here (and I don't mean just since I joined, in July - I've been reading here a lot longer than that).

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Thanks for your comprehensive and diplomatic reply..! Without having tested it, I suspect your 'price confirmation' entry strategy (above) is a more significant variation than the tweaks to the BB parameters... Enjoying this thread...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Karl. Enjoyed your post very much. Seems you put some work in your research. Did you ever play around with tick charts at all ? When you were experimenting with this. If so any thoughts ? Kind regards. Goose4..

--- 帖子 #156 ---
This method is definitely stronger when you have the MAs moving in your favor. I was looking at some charts just now for further learning and noticed the two circles below would've been valid entries, but as you can see the 120 MAs are turning the other way so the entries aren't the very strongest. Yes, they would've paid off in the end but in hindsight everyone is a genius.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi Jenx Chanced upon this thread you started yesterday and had an interesting read and some learning. I never really into indicators myself and had been scalping most of the time through price action, but so far no consistent result which it's solely myself to blame as I would turn them into runner win or lost. Patience is key and I am going to try out your setting. Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Tried that. Only when you try bare PA scalping do you realise how many false patterns get thrown up, pinbars, inside/outside closes, shooting stars, hanging man, etc! PA is important but you need a datum point for it to take place at, whether that be a set up like this, S/R or pivot points. Good luck

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thanks for the clarification, Jenx. I trade with naked chart, the most with Trend Lines and Support / Resistance Lines. Now with additional 5 lines (BB and SMMA), its getting confusing and crowded here on my chart, haha... Gonna take a while to get accustom. Nevertheless, whatever strategy or setup you may have, at the end of the day its still in the mind of the beholder... and I am currently still working hard on this one... For too many a time... a scalping trade end up becoming an intraday position. I ought to chop my hand man... But then some how or rather, we just have to keep learning day by day, trade by trade...

--- 帖子 #160 ---
All MA's will 'turn the other way' when the price is moving towards them because they're calculated by the price itself. It hasn't crossed them so they'll still curve upward. On a lower timeframe there are a lot more breakouts and grinds in the direction of a MA (Hence 'the trend is your friend'. There are only a few specific exceptions to this under certain circumstances in a highly volatile market.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Agreed (in part). That's why I told him to try the Keltner Channels and buy/sell on re-entry into the the channel rather than trying to catch it when it's on the way out. The problem is that in a tightly ranging market the breakout is likely to happen closer to the edges of a channel and you won't always have the time to properly gauge the PA before it gets there. But, a tightly ranging market spends more time in the channel so the rules are simple: Sell on re-entry into the top of the channel. Buy on re-entry into the bottom of the channel. The longer the price stays outside of the channel the better the odds of it being a good trade. The longer the price stays inside of the channel the worse the odds become of it being a good trade (and the greater the likelihood of a breakout). The more signals in one direction; the more likely the next signal will be in the opposite direction. The longer the price trends in one direction; the more likely a signal will be in the opposite direction. Obviously shortly after news releases things become more complicated and during the more volatile times of the day you'll have more signals. This doesn't apply to a strongly trending market because, well, you shouldn't really be scalping during a strong trend anyway.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Thank you and very diplomatic of you. But honestly, there's no need.This strategy works for me and my approach. All I have done is chuck it out there for people to have a play with. If anyone feels they can improve it to suit their style of trading, they should certainly try. If anyone comes up with a tweak to make this more effective, no one will be more interested than I. Not sure I want to entertain indicators, oscillators,etc but any valid improvement suggestions along the present lines are constructive to the thread and should be welcomed as we all stand to benefit. Cheers

--- 帖子 #163 ---
And talking of improvements, if any of you are experimenting with this ,I can highly recommend the add on that abokwaik coded on post #122 Makes life a lot easier.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Agree it's a great improvement but people still need to make their own decisions based on S/R. Here are two trades I've just closed, and I am sharing for my own and everyone who is new to learn from. This is USDJPY M1 chart - I marked 15 min support and resistance using purple horizontal lines and took what could be considered a valid entry. As you can see, I managed to close out for a very small loss, but price is just too close to resistance for it to break through. abokwaik's indicator is great for showing where entries are, but you still need to do the majority of the work and determine if the trade has the odds stacked in your favor. If I was to strictly follow the rules and get out when it hits the upper bollinger band, I would've walked away profitable on this one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is EURUSD M1 chart - same process, I marked 15 min support and resistance using purple horizontal lines. On this trade I managed to move my stop to BE+5 pips, which stopped me out when the price came back on a retracement. Here there was much more room for the trade to move although this trade was not perfect - I should've gotten out earlier when the price hit the upper bollinger band as that would've locked in more profit for me. Regardless, a win is a win and I walk away not only with profits, but also a few things learnt. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanks for sharing. That first UJ trade was an easy 10 pips. It filled all the criteria. Even the TP was handed on a plate. As for the M15 resistance, price had broken above, ,retraced and gave an entry signal with valid PA right on the previous resistance line, which may have now become support. A suggestion I would make is that as soon as you've cleared 9-10 pips start to look at closing it. If its beyond the upper band I definitely take it. Good luck and thanks again EDIT Sorry, I've just noticed your M15 R line is quite a number of pips higher than I had mine. I wonder if this could be a broker issue? Or maybe you use a different method of identifying S/R I've attached 2 pics first is switched to M15 so you can see how I marked the R line

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks mate - I am marking my S/R differently but will get better with practice and time. BTW there's a quicker way for you to save screenshots without having to scrub out account number each time. Go to File -&gt; Save as Picture -&gt; Active chart (as is) and select the option to load into MQL5 also. That should generate a link to the screenshot and then you should be able to attach it to your responses. Attached Image

EU giving up a lot of trades today. Good stuff

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I've just had a look at this. This is partly due to a suggestion "lifespirit" sent me by message. I've replaced the bbs with Keltner channel atr 140 as suggested.(I've set period as 25) (ReDeflect mentioned them also earlier in the thread) However, I've left on abokwaiks entry indicator still set at Bollinger band 25 ;2 and the smoothed MAs. Its essentially the same system just with a different look. Thoughts anyone?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
In my opinion, it really doesn't matter whether its BB or Keltner. What I like about your system is the simplicity. Its a trend trading system based on S/R. The stuff on chart is just a reminder to me of which direction may be easier, fight the trend or go with the trend. I hope you pick one and go with it for thread integrity. Suggestions never hurt but I hate seeing how a thread opens on page one and by the time you get to page 20, its completely different. Hope that doesn’t happen here.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
well done Jenx..... simply and nice system..... have a nice day

--- 帖子 #173 ---
yes, around 9:30 and 12:00 are two nice signals with keltner...just different. maybe an option for a second "system"?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I'd noticed that. It's the same system. I think maybe it just gives up a few more opportunities without affecting the integrity of the principle strategy?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
i like your questioning, because i would be too very careful in optimizing something that works already...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Jenx, Thank you for the simple system.. What time of the day you start trading..? The major pairs only? Thanks in advance! Bluejack

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi I'm usually at my computer by 07.30 French time, as there is often a nice little trade to be had as the banks automated systems adjust before European open. There is more often than not a decent trade around London open. There seems to be a flat spot between 10 and 11 gmt except if theres news on GBP pairs. Obviously the first 3 hours of New York tend to be the most fruitful. If I'm sat in front of the telly in the evening I usually have half an eye on my laptop as at least one trade will crop up during the late afternoon US session. I only really trade UJ and EU for reasons of spread.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Yes ,you're right. I'll have a bit of looking back on the charts over the weekend and see which is most effective. Absolutely won't be changing the essence of the system though, as its too profitable to really mess about with.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks Jenx for sharing this. I tried it out yesterday and today with much success on 4 pairings with zero spread. Your system combined with some common sense on reading candles is great.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thanks very much Jenx for your awesome and simple strategy. I just want to ask about your risk management strategy. Do you immediately move your stop loss closer to entry when the trade goes into your favor? By doing this we get a better risk/reward ratio. On the contrary, when trade does not go to our expectations, are we looking at around 1:1 risk reward? Its hard to predict the take profit line from this strategy. But I could see that the win rate is relatively high.

Jenx REALLY interesting method... KUDOS to you! Could I ask you if these are the settings that you now use regarding the Keltner channel?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
You'd need to change the period setting to 25 to match into the template we have

--- 帖子 #183 ---
If you read through the thread you'll see I don't really give much weight to ratios. I've found myself a system that gives such a high win rate that all ratios would do is bog me down worrying that I need to win X. My stops go at the previous swing low/high for emergency purposes but I tend to "wing it" and if things start going pear shaped I just kill the trade for a small loss. As we are trading with a trend (albeit on a small tf) the trades will more often than not go your way.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I've spent a few hours comparing my original template as described in post#1 and that using Keltner channels. My conclusion is that, although the Keltner channels throw up one or two more opportunities when used alongside the Bollinger bands and give some reassurance to those wishing to have confirmation, alone they become restrictive. My original template gives up so many opportunities, it would be just plain greedy and foolish to try to extract more. Another, and probably the most important for me, reason is portability. I very often like to trade off my phone if I'm travelling, and the MAs and BBs are freely available on the mt4 mobile app. The Keltner channels are an add on requiring a pc to use them. So for these reasons and to maintain the integrity of the thread, I'm just going to continue using the original template. Of course, if anyone finds more effective settings then feel free to contribute. Have a good weekend everyone and be happy.

Would just like to say. Tick charts at 55 ticks is interesting. on thursday with the fdax. The results were better than one minute chart (this is just one full day research I have done) Will keep updated with more data on this. I think the difference will be little. BTW your method is great. Jenx my friend- Have you ever thought about taking trades that are counter trend ? (in exceptional circumstances) Kind regards, Goose

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Your first post states " Direction- BB ma in relation to main MAs". When deciding long or short, do you only check if BB MA is above / below 120 MAs? Or do you check the slope of 120 MAs as well? Another question. Please have a look at the following UJ chart. BB MA is below 120 MAs (so direction is short), but price is above 120 MA. When taking a trade, would you prefer the price is above 120 MA for long and below 120 MA for short? Kind Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Personally, I find trading Deviation 2 Bollinger bands exhausting, but that is me. Since you like them, I thought I would offer you an advanced tool. You can put any additional time frame on your 1M chart, change colors for slope, and change color/thickness for individual lines. The lines are interpolated for easy viewing. This is from TrueTL, so I only have the exe file. You will have to manually place it in your Meta Trader/Indicators Folder. Good Luck. Attached File(s) scMTF Bollinger.ex4 35 KB | 899 downloads

Looks quite handy. Thanks

--- 帖子 #189 ---
No. Just where it's positioned in relation. I tend to be wary if the price meanders between tbe 2 ma's however if it just kicks through and gives a signal as in your pic, I would take it. If it did it after a period of consolidation I'd be more wary, but then there's a good chance the ma's would have switched anyway.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi Goose. I'll look at ticks tomorrow. You can't get them as a backrest, I don't think.only real time

--- 帖子 #191 ---
You can with ninja. Its order flow that has to be real time. Its interesting,i'm even thinking of checking second charts,maybe 30 seconds.If spread is under 1 pip,could still be possible. Im also going to check when we have entry on the one minute chart, how does it look like on lower timeframes,like the 30 second chart. Its will be interesting to see the fractal geometry on the market,at lower levels . I'm going to go live with this 2moro.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
See post #187 by dkrock. I've been having a look at using the tool they have kindly contributed as a way of filtering out some of the more sketchy signals. Going to give it some testing next couple of days but as you can see, our template is still there ( BBs in green MAs in purple) but I've overlaid the M15 BBs set at 25 with a standard deviation of 1.0. Rules exactly the same. Respect M15 S/R and cherry pick your trades. If in doubt, stick to the original set up. Have a happy and prosperous week everyone

--- 帖子 #193 ---
goose4 asked do I take trades counter trend. Yes, very occasionally. They aren't great value, don't crop up that often, but do tend to be very consistent so if one happens I'll generally take it. Not sure it's good practice and I'm no gambler. So just to answer the question I've attached a pic trying to illustrate. One happened this morning. Basically, you get a break above (or below ) the BB with a pull back? (I define a pull back as at least one bar closing in the opposite direction at a price lower( or higher) This is number 1; You next look for a CLOSE above the HIGH with a pull back; This is number 2 You next look for a CLOSE above this HIGH with a pull back; This is number 3 The trade is triggered next time price exceeds the HIGH of number 3 .TP is the lower band.(Which incidentally, would generate a signal to place a trade with the trend in any case) Please don't think I am promoting this as a scalping technique. Just to answer the question. Cheers

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Some good trade possibilty on USDJPY with support of the 120 ma's

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Yes some text book stuff this morning!

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Seem extremely risky unless PA support the retracement for the TP to be triggered, else you better be watching and monitoring the trade as it pan out. But YES, counter trend trade do work out sometime, but you have to know what you are looking for.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Absolutely. And I would never set and forget this.It really is a short term manual scalp.I don't look for these trades but if they stand out I'll take them I'm in no way advocating it as a scalping technique. Just answering the question. Cheers

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Sorry, I have a damn questions... How do you determine the current trend (during your trade session), i.e. deciding to Buy or Sell. Use the 2 MAs, on the M1 charts or do you look to M5 or M15 to determine the direction then wait for opportunity to pop up on the M1 chart via the BB? I kinda get caught up with the direction of my trade hence wanna clarifies.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Simply where the ma of the BBs is in relation to the main MAs. above buy, below sell Also I prefer the 120 MAs to be trending in a definite direction and not horizontal

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Meaning the BB MAs (middle line) is above the 2 MAs, is a BUY and vis versa? I was looking at the inclination of the 120 MAs to determine a buy or sell... GOSH!!! To further clarify, when the BB MA is above the 120 MAs, will be looking for a buy and should the 120 MAs is inclining upwards would be a much better BUY signal. Did I get it right?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Yes, that's it. Be careful if price is meandering between the 120 MAs and don't buy into resistance or sell into support ( M15 --- Read earlier posts how I define M15 S/R)

--- 帖子 #202 ---
COOLz... I GOT IT... Thanks for the clarification! It helps ALOT

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Jenx, here is a case which is not clear for me. my first choice would be the mangenta line. what Support Line would be your favorite? the turkis, red or mangenta one? thx!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Turquoise is the nearest. See my pics. First is the M15; The support line comes in at the lowest bar that got left behind. The second is when you zoom in to the M1 chart around the same time. What you can see there is that there is a support level around 30 pips lower !! Bear in mind late afternoon ,5pm GMT there is GBP news

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi jen, could you tell me which of the lines (red of blue) that i have drawn on this 5 min usd/jpy chart is correct or perhaps both of them are? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks

--- 帖子 #206 ---
hmm, i see. so some experience is needed to interpret S&amp;R with buff-style.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
If you're using M5 then I've drawn what I would see as S/R;(red lines) The yellow line is the high of the resistance bar. PA here is sometimes significant. If price fails to hold above , I would consider Resistance as having remained in place. If it is rejected then a new R bar will undoubtedly be formed in the process

--- 帖子 #208 ---
No, not at all. It is a definitive level.Identify the level on the TF you want then if you wish to refine that level, drop down the tfs until you find a highest/ lowest common denominator. In fact, this part of my strategy is completely unsubjective.It is what it is.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
i understand, so i will train my eye for the gaps at the end of consolidations. thx

--- 帖子 #211 ---
At least 3 decent trades there today

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Just for clarification, when I say don't sell into support or buy into resistance, as we are looking at taking in the region of 10 pips then if we have less than that to the S or R then forget it.More than 10 pip plus spread, no reason why not.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
hi mate.. this will help identify the lines .. maybe on a MTF 30 or 60 timeframe setting. It will draw a few extra lines than main ones Jenx method highlights, but it's the similarconcept of zero lines (zero-ing the profit haha).. hope it helps.

Hello, Good Chart !! Can share this chart?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi Sir, Can you help how to use this indicator?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I find it difficult to manage the risk:reward ratio for setting out stop loss in this scalping technique. I've been stopped out 4 out of 5 times on using this strategy today only to find out that the price went on to my desired direction but without my position. I have strict rules regarding my stop loss and I can never enter into a trade without placing stop loss and take profit. Anyone could suggest how to manage risks for this particular scalping technique? I want to be profitable in the long run using this technique as it fits my trading style.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Try playing with your lot size... You shouldn't be particularly concern with the risk:reward if you have a high win rate in scalping. In another way, to me time in position is risk to me, and if I keep my exposure to a minimum then my risk also reduce significantly. As mentioned in earlier posts, SL should be at the swing low/high. Hence if the mileage is too wide, then probably changing the size will help you manage your risk:reward. Just my half cent worth, I am still very much always in the learning phase

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi This is a trend following strategy and as such if your stop is placed at the previous swing high/low if it gets hit ,theres a good chance a trend isn't in place as higher highs and higher lows (and vice versa)are the norm in an established trend. If it suits your trading style/psychology,maybe try scaling your position in as there are usually more than one signal for each move?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi Jenx - thanks for posting this simple scalping setup. I've been experimenting with it on a longer timeframe (15m Dax) with the BB deviation set to 3.0 instead of 2.0 and a slow macd. The smoothed 120 ma's provided effective support during the choppy price action on Sept 14 and 15.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Just like to say, don't forget this strategy is not about maximising the amount of trades you can make in a day, but "cherry picking" the best ones and getting a value for money price. One suggestion I have for those of you struggling to identify opportunities is to wait for a valid set up to fail ( stop would have been hit) and then start looking at the next one. For me 2 or 3 trades a day is fine. Don't overdo it.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hello, I am still lost about how u find ur S &amp; R. can u explain again. I am quite confused about the 1st bar and 3rd bar u mentioned in previous post. would appreciate if u could explain again. thanks

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi No probs. Look at the pic. H4 on EU but its valid on every TF on every pair. Bar 1 has a high. Bar 2 takes off north. The low of bar 3 never touches the high of bar 1 This is significant. What it means is that there are traders trapped on bar1 who weren't able to get out of their short trades at BE Bar 2 created a "gap" if you like. Those traders are now holding onto their trades hoping price comes back to them. As soon as it does they'll offload them quicker than you can say Helen Yellen. This may very well provide supply to continue the trend. The high of bar 1 becomes the support line (Yellow line) ( you can actually zoom in to the lower tfs at the same time to refine the level) You need to watch the price action at this level . You can see what happened when price returned. ( I bet my bottom one that the low of the return touched the M1 support on the same bar) Look left and you'll see it actually happened on 2 other occasions just on this pic

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Further to post #220 - works great on a 2m timeframe as well.

Thanks so much! it apply the same when looking for resistance? Means we look for 1st bar low, then 2nd bar create "gap", then high of 3rd bar did not touch low of 1st bar. so low of first bar become resistance? correct me if I am wrong

M15 S/R on U/J today; Need we say more ?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I am slightly puzzled as to how you are actually incorporating these S and R levels from the 15 min chart into your trading, like you one you just posted, you couldnt take a trade from that level as on the 1 min chart you would of been below the 120 MA band, and in that example the first opportunity to take a trade wasnt until about 15 minutes ago.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Heres the M1 chart at the same time You going to sell into that? No, I thought not.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Sorry what i mean is, there is no buying opportunity there because your below the 120 MA's?

Just to illustrate. I've just been looking at making a trade. As you can see, signals have been generated, but I had drawn a M1 resistance line based on my rules ( look left and you'll see why). Right now I'm waiting to see what PA does here. For the moment it looks to have broken above but I'll wait and see. In any case its likely to switch to a long set up. Just to illustrate one example of being subjective in choosing your trades.Don't just trade because a signal was generated. Have a great day

--- 帖子 #247 ---
What does PA means? and also what do u see to enter? like what signs to see the market is going down or up, bc i tend to enter at a "bad" price

--- 帖子 #248 ---
PA is Price Action. Just how the price forms itself at a given level. As you can see, I'd identified a R line that needed to be filled so even though the signals were valid that line kept me out of the trade until price got there and I could see what happens. No one can know what the market is going to do next so don't get your head involved in that. All we can do is trade with the probable direction- the trend. If I cant get a good value price, I don't take the trade. Good luck

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hello Jenx, Attached Image The north, significant resistance The south, textbook trade if the PA elements not included this method, looks certainly south is the best.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Bonjour Jenx, Have you ever tried a system like this: Trend = 240 ema exponential (same as your 120 smooth) i used it for a long time. Initial enter when color change + re-enter the trade at each arrow - exit when opposite arrow. Seems good on paper but as your strategy, you need lots of practice and experience. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Green pips to you ps: sorry for english

Not great PA today, anyone caught anything? I got 1 7.5 pip loss on usd/jpy Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I think after the big moves last night, the USD pairs were always going to be sketchy this morning. Also when you look at the PA at the resistance that was set by the move, buying into that area probably isn't going to offer the best returns.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Jenx you should post your entry/exit points on the charts together with your stop losses. This will give us an idea how to place SL properly using your strategy.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
can check out aussie pair or new zealand pair. movement bigger

--- 帖子 #259 ---
As I said, the SL just goes beyond the previous swing high/low.If it gets hit, the pair wasn't trending in any case. Have a read through the thread. As I said on post 1, I will not be sharing trades or giving signals. This thread is purely me sharing the strategy I use for trading. Your approach to it must be your approach. It requires subjectivity and judgement and that is different for all of us. Numerous valid opportunities come up all day. I generally take 2 or 3, you may want more or less. The system is simple. Trading is not. It is something we all have to develop in our own way if it is to be consistently profitable. Don't go looking for an "off the shelf" system that will all of a sudden make your trading easy. It doesn't exist.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Jenx, do you enter position in every arrow? Thanjks!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
No, not at all. I don't take every trade that crops up. In fact that's the essence of the system. There are many trades that turn up.The secret is using common sense and cherry picking the best.Once you get the hang of it, you'll start to see the trades that suit you. For example, if price rejects a resistance level, the trend switches and I get a sell signal, I generally won't take the first one.If it "fakes out" ie goes back up and hits what would have been my stop, then drops again, the next trade that turns up will usually be a "sitter" Of course I use common sense and look at the Price action.I also want a good value price outside of the bands.I also don't take 2 consecutive opportunities.Thats not the only situation of course but just an example of how I look at the charts. Everyones different and there are more than enough trades to choose from during the day, just don't get into the habit of trying to catch every one

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I'm coding an "info center indicator" for this method showing (from top to bottom) 1) Candle/Bar timer 2) ADR info days configurable e.g. 50, ADR 50 value is shown in gray headline, the ADR from today is shown in big numbers below (green when ADR today haven't reached ADR 50 3) 120 MA Smoothed angle value I tend to take trades only when the angle of the 120 MA's are bigger than ~8 for example 4) Bollinger MA /120 MA WAITING if 120 MA angle is too small (your wished "min angle" can be set in indicator settings) ONLY LONG if BB 25 MA is above 120 smoothed MA and angle is bigger than your set min angle value ONLY SHORT if BB 25 MA is below 120 smoothed MA and angle is bigger than your set min angle value 5) Pip counter shows +/- pips (green/red) when you have an open position - nothing to see on the chart below because I had no position open 6) Spread Any ideas/whishes what should also be added to this "info indicator"?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Sounds great! I tend to watch BB middle line (which is 25 SMA in our case)and its angle (put 25 SMA on my chart), but cannot figure out how it could be incorporated in your proposed template. Maybe make it in colour (i.e. if it is sloping down - red, if up - green)? Just a thought. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Congrats. mate ! You know, important criteria PA elements. Can you added s/r indic. with info window ? This is the illustration, https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post10304720

Hello Jenx and others. I caught a couple of really nice moves on EU and GU today. Not sure what it is lately, but smoother trending moves have been easier to find pre NY session and at or near London close. Not sure if its the overall volume during the three hours or so they overlap. I took GU about an hour and half ago and EU about an hour ago. They both paid off nicely. I've also been scaling into a full position (not martingale), so I can let some of them ride. A lot of times over the last week or so, my "let them ride" positions have been getting stopped out at break even. Today though, one position on GU was good for 15 and the let it ride was good for 45. Also netted just under 50 on EU. Very frustrating when it takes you out at break even, but days like today will definitely make up for those losers of 5,10,15 pips. Keep up the good work guys, some very good, constructive material here.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
But you traded during NY session if I'm not mistaken? Not during pre NY session and at or near London close as you have mentioned?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Yes it was during NY/London Session, but near London close. GU was about 45 minutes pre London close and EU was about 10 minutes before London close. If you look at the chart you'll have little doubt where I entered. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we should avoid the NY/London session overlap, just making an observation. I did not trade pre NY though, so you are correct in that observation. I do though when I can get my butt up and out of bed.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Are there any testers here that could recommend a time that is optimal for trading this strategy? I have had success trading the around two hours after NY open.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
with GU more that +13

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Just to say that I've had a modicum of success last couple of days with this "tweak". I changed the BB standard deviation to 2.5 and when a signal is generated I wait until price goes lower/higher than the signal bar and enter there. Not as many signals are generated but the ones that are seem to be better quality.Obviously the rules still apply and I don't just trade because a signal was generated. I'll have a look over the next week and see if its consistent. Good luck everyone

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Took 9 pips on ucad short. Moved SL to break even on second position which will most likely get hit with news coming soon, but at this point nothing to lose so I'll risk it. Hey it could drop nicely right?!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
wow, that was quick. Well, it was expected though, on to the next.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
So if we are trending up and price comes down to the lower BB you would wait for that bar to close and the following bar to go above the high of that previous bar (you dont wait for it to close), is this correct?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Suppose the next two-three bars also generate signals (arrows) but the price goes lower and does not exceed the high of the signal bar (price is "walking" the band lower), and only fourth or fifth bar goes above the high of the signal bar. Does your new entry method still apply, or is it only the NEXT bar after the signal bar that needs to go higher to trigger entry? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Heres an example. SL just beyond prev swing low.I didn't take this trade as I'd taken the previous one, and a rule of thumb I have is no 2 consecutive trades

--- 帖子 #276 ---
As happened on the above example! I wasn't suggesting to change the strategy just mentioning I was trying out a modification. My advise would be stick to the original strategy

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Chart with BB 2.5 Dev (blue/red arrows) and parallel (the gray lines) mladen's TMA channel (with 1.618 BandsDeviations) which has pink/green arrows. Both generated good signals today on USDJPY

Scaling in to GU short. May still speaking I believe so very careful here.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Stopped out. Average position = 1.3549, SL hit at 1.3564 for a 15 pip hit. Entry was possibly just a little too early or just plain wrong. Time will tell.

Two trades on my demo account today @10 pips each!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Thanks Jenx for this system, I've been following the forum and trying it on demo, I use it with the following rules: *Indis on your original settings. For long trades: 1. Price under Lower BB 2. 120 SMMA over Upper BB 3. 120 SMMA should be over Upper BB for at least 10 candles 4. Upper BB - Lower BB &gt; 10 pips 5. To take trade check PA and open trade when price surpasses high of the signal candle. Also fewer signals but a lot better, although PA is critical in taking trades. For shorts is the opposite. Also, about the scalping mentality I think you got it just right. I attached a signal indicator following the rules I posted in case anyone is interested. Anyway thanks again, this seems like a great system.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
For long trades: 1. Price under Lower BB 2. 120 SMMA over Upper BB ??? perhaps UNDER? 3. 120 SMMA should be over Upper BB for at least 10 candles perhaps UNDER? Thanks

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Try to aim higher TP for your wins to get a better RR. Price action really helps when you have good entries using this strategy. For instance, during long trades when you see price breaking the upper BB band with strong signals (using Price action or candlestick analysis) then bouncing off the middle BB band, it does not make sense to sell when you can aim for at least 20-30 pips. This occurs quite often during volatile session like the NY London overlap. Moreover, like Jenx said, when you know Price Action you could sense that sometimes trade may not work on your favor and its better to kill off the trade without any losses. So far that has led to my success during the past two weeks. Personally, I try to keep my losses at around 3-5 pips using precise entries. When I see the trade going into my favor immediately upon entry like seeing a huge candle, I then move my stop loss really tight. This is a scalping technique I got from other forums to minimize losses. Once again, Thank you very much Jenx!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
interresting answer, thx. i see it different. i prefer a higher winrate, like 80%-90% making +8,10,12 or seldom +15 pips. i dont really care about RR. when i have 20-30 pips/day (from 2-3 trades) then i change to very conservative trading mode for the rest of the day or turn off my computer. to get 20-30 pips from a single trade is nice, but there are days when the market only gives you 10 pips. in other words: psychology is for me more important than mathematics. its just my way of thinking i feel comfortable.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Would you guys trade 1 lot for this strategy? Silly question, but just curious of how you guys would scalp.

This

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Thanks. I like the the BB gap size thing, but correct me if I'm wrong, does your modification not generate signals upside down to what they should be?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi. I don't know how experienced you are at trading but if you are relatively new, no way should you yet be trading whole lots or more, even if you are sufficiently capitalised. It takes a certain psychological approach that comes with experience to comfortably trade, and more importantly, take losses using these sizes of trades. I would recommend starting with micro lots and work your way up slowly building your risk acceptance/ tolerance levels.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I guess they do, but I'm seeing great results and in my review of past market it works well also. Not really sure why, anyways thanks for replying and keep up the good work.

Not very experienced, but I'm just curious how many lots experienced scalpers trade on a regular basis?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
There is no one size fix all... As Jenx had mentioned, apart from depending on your experience, I think it's also depend on what you are trying to achieve and then break it down to a realistic and doable manner. Working your way up from micro lot is a good method as it will help you build your confidence level as well, however do note that if you stay at micro for too long, there may be possible chance for you to pick up bad habit and excessive risk appetite too.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Jenx, Thanks for sharing this simple system. I will try this system soon. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
The signals it gives on PA coming off S/R looks nice. Cheers and good luck

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Jenx, thanks for sharing your scalping idea. It refreshened my attitude towards scalping. It is some weeks that I use it and I am happy. My twist of it: 1. I use an indicator "Buyers_Sellers_Indicator" that gives me an idea of the TP, aside waiting for a signal in the opposite direction 2. when I open a trade I apply an EA that starts martingale orders if the trade goes wrong. Until now it never went beyond the third level In this way I have never had a loss!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi I've never tried Martingale. I do understand how it works and as such I can see how most of the time it would prevent you losing. However I would be very wary as it will only take one too many "doubling downs" to wipe your account. Good luck

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Textbook trade. Just few minutes ago. Waited patiently for the right moment. I used the new 2.5 Standard deviation the Jenx recommended last friday. Gave me a good signal for instant 10 pips profit. Though it was quite a risky trade as I sold into support but in my opinion, support was already broken

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Absolutely

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi, must say i am impressed guys. Part time trader with main focus on 4h chart for the past years. Tried this simple but good scalpingsystem with good result...Keep it simple i guess... Yes there is more work to be done with scalping...Takes more time etc... But its pretty easy to catch 20-40 pips/day with this system AND your personal Top Down analysis... Well done

--- 帖子 #301 ---
is there a template for your strategy jenx

--- 帖子 #302 ---
interesting, looking for something like this, my systems all med term stuff. so this is EURUSD 1 min, a valid short?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
That entry should work for a short scalp. I wouldn’t get greedy and expect it to break the low with NY coming in and expecting to get a better price. Good luck. I'm looking for a retracement back up around 1.1810 for a possible short entry.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
That turned out to be a good trade for 12 pips.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Really great scalping strategy Jenx, I'av been testing it for a while now and its been quite accurate. Tho I'av included fractals to help with placing my stop loss I made several trades today and ended up having one drawback. The pics below show three win trades

--- 帖子 #306 ---
How unfortunate. I got stopped out several times today. This particular trade went to almost 20pips. SL was prolly too tight. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Probably yes, your stop was too tight, but we're speaking scalping here, so don't beat up yourself too much. If i can shed my 2c that looks like a perfect example of stop hunting. In hindsight one might consider reentering on the next bar after the stop...

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I would say stop too tight. I only took one trade and let it run (it never comes back to BE, made 4 exits). Missed last long entry (blue arrow is indi from here, green arrow is my TMA variant).

--- 帖子 #309 ---
The SL is for protecting your account, but while protecting your account don't forget to protect your SL, if you know what I mean!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Yes, your SL was too tight. 2 pips was too tight. I always trade without SL, because always hunt for my SL. But I have to monitor closely, when it really goes the other way, I will manually exit.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I wouldn't say your SL is too tight, afterall who can define how tight is considered tight? Personally, I will generally plus/minus 2 pips to the place where my stop is identified to account for overrun. Often then not, they will probably end up to be about 4 to 6 pips. Also my general rule is a TP of 1 pip then SL is 2 pips and if TP is 3 then SL will be 6 pips, I know many is going to bomb me for this R:R ratio, but if I am scalping I usually dun look at R:R but on win rate instead. Define SL = SL should be placed at a place that it will not be hit

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Thank you JenX for this simple scalping method... This method has minimized my 5-min trading method, which I use 1SMA &amp; 2EMAs on 5 mins. Today only I have got 40 pips (on 4 trades - 10pips TP each trade)... And I run on real micro account. I will try to capture my tradings using this simple scalping of yours, because right now I use my handphone only to trade. I will update again soon...

--- 帖子 #313 ---
any TE for this strategy? some good trades, some bad. would be great to know if someone gettting an egde

--- 帖子 #314 ---
UJ and EU today

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Trying UJ short right now. Got in 112.71

--- 帖子 #316 ---
TE? i am getting an edge.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Closed position +1. No follow thru. Decent day though.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Good luck with that one Jenx, I think I was a bit early. I'm eyeballing EU long around 1.1741 and that'll be it for today.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I deleted the post as I realised I was "sharing " a trade . Don't want to get into that. Had some good trades today so also need to be wary of getting greedy and handing it back. Been there in the past.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Oh sorry, did you not want trade sharing on the thread? I can delete my post (I think) and won't do it again.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
No, not at all. Share away. In fact its important to the thread. I feel its important however that I, in sharing the system in the first place, don't get into sharing trades or giving signals. This system is all about subjectivity and everyone needs to develop their own approach. I don't want to be responsible for anyone following the way I approach it. On the contrary, I think its important that people share their own different approaches to give an empirical view of options to anyone visiting and wondering how to develop their own approach, if you know what I mean.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
my trade today nearly +20 with EU:

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hi Jenx, do you consider M15 120 SMA as support/resistance level?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Challenge of 100 trades completed, thanks Jenx again.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Not particularly, but there's no reason why not if the PA backs it up.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Congrats ! Great score mate, hope to still going same success with live acc. Can you talking about your trades trigger, ( i.e are you included PA elements or blindly indicator trading ) or whats your criteria about TP/SL settings etc.. ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thanks Saygin-TR a little bit of PA, S/R M15/H1 and take 5pips stop 15pips

USD/JPY Sweet 12 pip

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Trying to catch a few here on EU long at 1.1805

--- 帖子 #337 ---
May I know why the MA is 120?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Not sure why Jenx chose the 120, but I do think it is interesting how it relates to where the 5min timeframe BB mid line would be on the chart . . .

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I notice it is the buffer on 200ema on higher timeframe. not sure how accurate is it

--- 帖子 #340 ---
It was just after some trial and error. It gave the best filter for trending trades whilst also allowing tradeable conditions in a ranging market. That's all

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Thanks for the great scalping method! Ive read through everything and am playing with the method now. Am I wrong in thinking that the closer price gets to the SMA channel, that the riskier the trade becomes, because it has an easier chance to push through to the opposite side? I know you have said not to take trades close to the channel, but it also appears that most setups to happen around there, as this is where price seems to be magnetically attracted... Can you elaborate on this a little? Cheers!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Its a bit subjective. If price is around the channel for the first time in a while, its usually a good trade. If it "meanders" around inside its a bit riskier. If it goes there without making a new low/high from the last time it was there, again riskier but no reason why not if the PA confirms it. Obversely, if it fires through and gives a signal, its more often a good signal than not. In any case use common sense and if in any doubt, wait for a better opportunity.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
has anyone tried this on a higher time frame like 5 or 15?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
thank you, it works great!

--- 帖子 #345 ---
It seems to give nice results getting signals on M5 then switching to M1 , although you're then picking tops and bottoms on the shorter TF (however this sometimes filters out those times when price "rides" the bands on M1) and requires a slightly different approach, but yes, perfectly valid.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
10pips with GU

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I'm probably the only one here that this is not working for me Can someone help?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Here it is another FAIL... the market seems slow but still.. I even put some more stuff for confirmation. It didn't help

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Firstly, you've got a heck of a lot going on there.Do you really need all of that? Secondly, both those charts would have been selling/buying into significant S/R. Best to sit those ones out.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
hmm.. very good points I never took PA going into S/R as a factor.. As you see I plotted S/R levels (programatically plotted yesterday's hi/lo etc, pivots) and stoch/RSI jbecause I seem to overtrade and right now I need these 'filters'. As you see the round number on EU coicided perfectly with you significant S/R and the yesterday's level coincided with UC S/R on your charts. Here is a trade that went well:

--- 帖子 #351 ---
rkp, S&amp;R from jenx (or templeton) is a main important part of this approach here traded. and dont worry about losses, i have them too, but i dont show them here. anyway, approximately 8 out of 10 i close with a profit so far trading this style...

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Great thread Jenx, I'm a big proponent of KISS strategies. Don't want to overcomplicate things or thread drift, but just wanted to say that RSI can be another great filter for BB strats. A simple RSI 14 with 40/60 levels may be useful here.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Nice one. BTW whats the coloured "fill" you have between the MAs?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Thx, birdland.. Let me go with the filters for now because I know myself and I tend to overtrade. Once I get more comfortable I may switch to the simpler way.. *Question: Jenx said that SL is usually the previous swing hi/lo. If the RR is very inferior, will this be taken into consideration? Let's say RR is 2:1 or more (meaning SL 2 times TP) Or is that not relevant and system is profitable even when using an inferior RR most of the times? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
its an MA-ribbon indicator, and i use 110 and 130 SSMA for that colors:

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Cheers ,Looks handy!

--- 帖子 #357 ---
So, I decided to follow your advice and I replicated Jenx's template exactly and learned (I think) how to plot the buff S/R. I really like this system and I hate to be a pain. I know I seem like a troll but I just want to make it work for me. Can you help me, please on this next fail? Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
i lost too about 6 pips on this...dont worry, the trade was fine.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Jenx, update us with your forward testing on the BB bands with 2.5 Standard deviations. Do you recommend it more than the original standard deviation of 2?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Mind explaining how to use this indicator?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
simple as a trendindicator like 120 ssma...its just better visualized.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Don't worry they don't all work! What I will say is it's quite handy to look left and see where the last buff "gap" was formed after definite consolidation not just 1 or 2 bars

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Quick +10 on Ucad short.If you look at the resistance at 1.2511 and match up with base indi's, was a perfect entry. Less than 3 minutes for 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Gonna try EU long around 1.1749 if it gets there.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Nope. Missed that one. Tried to cut it too fine. Back at it tomorrow. Good luck all.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi; Tested it quite extensively and came to the conclusion that over any length of time, it offers no real advantage over the original set up.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Ok, my point of view..... I used to be an indicatorholic My main trading is 1h and 4h chart...Its doing quite well, but this thread caught my interest...... I use the same tools as described in the first post...The only "extra thing" i have is a news indicator.... When trading the 1/5/15 chart i always stay out of market during the newstime...It always gets choppy.... GBP had some red news today at 4.30 So my little advice: use the indicators in post 1, add a news indicator so you dont miss the newstime...AND draw your support/resistance on 1h/4h chart..Then switch to your 1 min chart and start trading..... Keep It Simple...i promise it will pay off... /regards

--- 帖子 #368 ---
good system to try

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Good advice

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Thanks for you post! Please put up a 1 min chart as you use when you trade. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
hello jenx, why do you prefer m15? is it just because its more handy? thx

--- 帖子 #373 ---
sysmaya, thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #374 ---
All tfs are valid. I look at M15 but I also look at the M1 to see the nearest S/R points above and below after consolidation

--- 帖子 #375 ---
In my experience such EA don't work on real accounts. Additionally, EA was tested on MetaaQuotes data on demo and that data is known to be inaccurate (not true tick data) and accurate tick data is essential for scalping EA's. I tried to back test it using good tick data but the EA could not trade - error 130 meaning stops/TP is too close. My take on this is that this EA will miserbly fail on a real account. So, just a warning - don't get too excited too fast.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I've yet to be convinced that any EA , ever, can be consistently profitable in the long term. But good luck to anyone who is trying.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
thx, a lucky trade wih UC for +10. the stop was very near but not triggered;-)

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thats one of those trades where even if your stop had been hit, the PA would make it a good re entry.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
re-entry? you mean to wait for a new signal? or immediately re-entry above the 120 ssma?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
No.The criteria for a short was still there. Price hadn't meandered around the MAs but had shot straight through, and then the PA at the swing high was indicative of a stop hunt. This is where subjective thinking comes in. The probability of that turning into a successful trade was high. Doesn't mean you have to take it, and I don't trade that pair but if that set up had occurred on my chart ,I suspect I would have taken it.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
i see, i understand now what you mean...thx! indeed a typical stop hunting from the bars picture.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Trying EU short here at 1.1761

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I don't like this short trade above 1.1769 so risking 9 pips. Stop at 70.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Well I hope someone got a better entry than I did on that one. Clearly 64/65 was the correct entry which would have produced a quick 9/10 pips. My TP is at 51 and stop at 70. Gonna let it run and be back for NY afternoon. Should be interesting.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Nice trade just now. Saw 15min TF Resistance broken with nice move. Took easy 10 pips. I recommend trading at NY and LONDON overlap. Had more success using this strategy.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Jenx I am new to this thread and would firstly like to say thanks for sharing and also for dealing with some of the enquiries from those that have either not read the thread or do not understand the principles by which you trade, in a polite professional manner, so many of these promising threads degenerate into argumentative wastes of time. Whilst I certainly don't want to make any fundamental changes to the simple and effective system you have shown us, from (admittedly a couple of days only) some manual back-testing, I found that adding a 50EMA to the chart and only taking entries that drop outside the BB and also on to the wrong side of the EMA, helps filter out some potential losers, but so far doesn't seem to prevent taking good trades. I'd appreciate your thoughts, or of those who spent longer reviewing this strat than I have. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
One finds that less is more. Rather than add more lines and provisos it would be better to reduce matters to a bare minimum with price being king. This would prevent your chart looking like an abstract art pattern, the effect of which, leads to paralysis by analysis. The original Post one is all that is required. Often, one finds that many aspiring traders feel that surrounding themselves in a spaghetti of lines will prevent losses. On the contrary, too many lines lead to inaction or ill thought out plunges into trades. Accept that you will have losers and manage your money by managing your losers.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Thanks for this indicator, is it possible you could please add an alert function? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #389 ---
1st trade and a loser, can anyone see any errors for the entry on this? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi Edlich. No Idea what additional MA you use.. and it´s up to you. I learned "never change a running system".. 1. You jump in the market around market open/market overlap, what means a lack of volatility becomes a rush.. .. not easy to trade.. and in m1 really harsh. 2. I see 2 reactions before .. marked them.. stay tuned Guido

--- 帖子 #391 ---
The green line is support. It was a "gap" support that wasn't obvious on the M15 chart but was clear on M5. Even without that, the PA was showing support being respected. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
either I have started with this strat on a bad day or I am doing something wrong?? In the screen shot below, I resisted the temptation to take the first trade marked yellow due the recent consolidation, but after breaking out of the consolidation, then dipping back to bounce off the lower BB, I figured this was the right entry point, only to be proven very wrong. I would welcome any guidance. Cheers Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #393 ---
All I can say is that when you look at M5 / M15 the range is rather tight. I've plotted resistance and left on support. As you can see, by the time our system gives you a signal its a bit too close for comfort to S/R; Theres some value to plotting your short/medium term S/R on a pair and if its all abit tight maybe look at a different pair, or wait for it to break out of that range with the next S or R being a decent distance away.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
do you mean this point i have market on m5 as a S-line? because i have not found a point on the left side...

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Yes exactly. If theres not an obvious S/R on the tf youre looking at just drop down a tf till you find one.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
but this S was forming at the same time the signal for a short came, so in my eye you cant take it as a S?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
But if you look left you'll see that it formed solid support on more than one occasion at around the same price level on both M15 and M5. EU , for me, hasn't given good value this morning but UJ for example has thrown up 2 very good trades. Like I said earlier, if one pair doesn't look attractive for any reason, choose another or wait till it does. S and R is much more crucial to this method than are the signals generated. S/R should always be your first consideration.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
hi, I use this system on H1 and it works great I never trade under the H1 timeframe .. for me it's more accurate very important for the profitability of the system(for me): trade only from S / R zone and use PA patterns for entry .. trades 1: 1 or 1: 2 then the system is powerful ... thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #399 ---
yes, if you look at "atheers" or "tro`s" S&amp;R lines i agree....but thats a different story and has nothing to do with "trading in the buff" S&amp;R. anyway, i recommend everybody here to get in touch with atheers method to see S&amp;R, that may help to avoid the last EU short trade, near the S and RN of 1.1750

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I don't think you understand. It doesn't matter what method you use for identifying S and R. The point is that my method, and yours it would seem, would rule out making any trades on that pair.( until the support was broken that is) Same difference. In fact, looking at the M1 chart, I don't see how you were given a signal to sell into support? (Apart from first thing this morning, but that Support had been well and truly respected beforehand)

--- 帖子 #401 ---
i hope eldlich, who had the problem, comments... for me the trade was also not a good short.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
This morning I favoured UJ; As we've said, EU looked a bit sketchy and the early S/R was a bit close. Here is UJ this morning with the S/R lines drawn in. You can probably see why it would be favoured over EU so far today. Of course the last signal isn't very valid due to the proximity of the support line.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see what tempted you to take a short? There have only been 2 shorts generated on that pair (EU) today( by our rules that is). The first, was a no go, due to the proximity of the support (same with the longs generated) and the second came after support had been well broken (which is valid)

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Long UJ again. Last one about 45 minutes ago gave up an easy 10.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
If 112.53-56 holds it'll be another winner. If not, I'll give 5 back to the market.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi all. I traded today from 2 hours after London open to 2 hours after NY open (skipped the news of course.) London session was not so good to me but still was up a little. Joint session was better after the news. 4 trades, 1 loss due to tight stop (see AU trade). I noticed that if the stop was bigger than the TP, the edge was lost and that's how it got taken out on AU per stop being at RR 1:1 - I could not place it higher. I usually place TP at nearest swing hi/lo even if it is NOT reaching the BB. Is this a little too conservative? What is a good place for SL and TP in your opinion? Attaching NYO trades for reference..

--- 帖子 #407 ---
The only advice I can give in response to SL is this....It won't matter if your stop is 3 pips or 30 pips. If the trade is wrong you will lose regardless. Even if the trade is right, it may be wrong, get it?! Have an idea where the support and resistance is before you enter a trade. Entry near support requires a small stoploss, but make sure it also has some room to be able to hit your take profit. Some trades will require a 12 pip stop, others a 5 pip stop. There shouldn't be a default stop level in my opinion. Read what the chart is telling you. If wrong, get out and try again. Remember, protect the account, protect the account, protect the account, and finally, yup you guessed it,....protect the account.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
dont understand me wrong: i didnt take the EU short due to S lines around the RN i saw with my S&amp;R method. i would like to hear a comment from "edlich" who was asking for support...

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Q1: Thank you point taken. How about the profit level (TP)? Any comments on that? Reiterating: &gt;&gt;I usually place TP at nearest swing hi/lo even if it is NOT reaching the BB. Is this a little too conservative? What is a good place for SL and TP in your opinion Q2: Do you guys trade on Fridays? Or Mondays? Isn't the market readjusting (Mon) and dumping orders (Fri)?

--- 帖子 #411 ---
That's down to your judgement. I rarely look for many more than 10 pips ( all 3 of your trades gave that up , although the USD/CHF was a touch buying into R). Sometimes I catch hold of a nice move and get 15 or more, but that's just good fortune. No probs with your SL placement, but if the bands are fairly close together you need to ask yourself if there is the potential. No particular days for trading or not trading. I sit at my computer if I've nothing else to do and hope to catch a trade.Thats it.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
i take either around 10-12 pips or the lower band. thats why we call it scalping

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thank you all. Good advice. @jenx The NEAREST buff level I saw on USDCHF was the one attached. So the trade was Off that level and not Towards it (if that matters, IDK...) Are you referring to something else? Did I set the buff level correctly? Thanks

--- 帖子 #414 ---
The "buff" gap was set on the M5 chart and wasn't evident on the M15; In any case its now been well and truly broken! Bear in mind, the M15 level you identified was created today.It was filled within a couple of hours. You need to be thinking will you be buying or selling into a level that has yet to be filled( which may very well create a reversal)

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Many thanks!! It's all clear now. So, I guess we are glancing over M5 as well for buff zones..

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Go down to M1 if you need to. More often than not you'll identify a gap on M15 (or any other TF for that matter), but the M1 in the same period will give you a much more accurate price.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
today i see many daily charts like AU or EU on the lower Band and UC or UCH on the upper band. so maybe we see a trendchange after the big news in the afternoon.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
You could be right. But of course, daily trends don't really concern us. In fact, if you look at your example when the last times it was overbought/sold , the trends carried on.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
of course, it was just an observation.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
I agree. Its just that in the past, I've gotten into the habit of looking at those higher TFs and thought ,I'm not buying/selling into that, its way overbought/sold when, of course, overbought/sold just means theres interest. Hope you catch some good trades today, and ,of course,be careful around NFP

--- 帖子 #400 ---
thats an interesting point, thx of warning for this what can happen when i have it in my subconcious. so far no trade because i had no time;-)

--- 帖子 #401 ---
jenx, i have a question regarding your experience with buff S&amp;R: on the M1 chart you see EU from this morning. 1 and 2 are typical for the gap, BUT 3 does not break the low of 2. is it still a valid R around 1.17106 ? thx for reply.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
No, that's fine. The "3" bar doesnt have to break the low of 2 (although its preferable),all we're interested in is the gap between the low of 1 and the high of 3. The gap has left long traders behind meaning itwill provide some sort of supply when price returns there.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
i understand, thx!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi all. Since I started trading LO/NYO overlap session I traded after NFP. One trade so far. Well, the news usually create gaps, right? The only thing I saw was a short on EU and I took it because the small gap had just been filled. All other setups on other pairs had the gap sitting on top (they panned out nevertheless but I did not take them.) I shot for 10 pips on EU but BB contracted and I closed at the lower BB for around 6 pips. Is my analysis correct? Did I see the gap correctly?

--- 帖子 #405 ---
For example, see how GU had a good short setup that was successful but the gap was on top and I skipped it. Was that the right thing to do?

my only trade today GU short for +20

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Nice Work! I took 10 on UCad short and now waiting for possible EU long. That 1.1670-1.1685 looks to be pretty good support. I need more confirmation though.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Took the next EU short right after the first one I posted and it was successful as well... AU had a gap that filled quickly and took me out but traded micro lots there just to make a point. Overall, around 9 pips in the green for me. Done for the day. @ birdland Wasn't your trade near the gap? Weren't you afraid the gap may close and take you out? Or did I not plot the gap correctly?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
near the gap? GU had no S in my way so i took the short trade. i am not sure what you mean.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Take a look at my post with the GU chart above. There is a gap above and not in the direction yes, but yesterday Jenx said that you never know when a gap may close and reverse the position and take you out. So, it was not safe to trade in either direction when the gap was near. Can Jenx please confirm all this, please? See the attached chart for further clarification.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi. Sorry, I maybe haven't explained the whole "gap" thing very well. Forget about gaps that occur during the actual movement you are trading. The gaps I am talking about are ones that occurred in the past that had yet to be revisited. If you are approaching one of those gaps or, more importantly, as in your case above, the gap had earlier been filled and direction had changed as a result, it doesn't make for a very good value trade. In answer to your trade above,the first pic is the M15 back on 14 July when the gap had formed. The second pic is the M1 from yesterday showing your failed trade and that line in place, and the 3rd pic is the M15 from yesterday showing how that level had been visited for the first time early yesterday ,since July 14, and had convincingly acted as support. It was then retested yesterday afternoon around the time you took your short into it. Hope this explains. Have a good weekend.

thx both jenx and rkp for clarification. i think its now clear...

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thanks, Jenx! All clear now (I hope).. Questions will come next week I'm sure Have a good weekend all!

--- 帖子 #414 ---
This may make things a bit clearer for those struggling with the S/R method Jenx is talking about. This e-book is now freely available so hopefully OK to post it here. If not, someone let me know and I'll remove it Attached File(s) tradebuff.pdf 1.0 MB | 2,998 downloads

Hy everyone. Thank's for your idea, it's so brilliant. I just know FX about 2 month ago, and I want ask some help: 1. How to set Smoothed MA 120 high/low ? 2. How to set S/R line ? I used mt4. Thank's for ur helping

--- 帖子 #441 ---
hello everyone and id like to express my thanks to all the members for offering such insight and thanks especially to jenx for starting the thread with his method. i know you said you will not post any signals or trades and that is absolutely fine. can you post a video explaining visually in detail precisely what the exact methods are and what you look for and how to enter &amp; exit etc. i think this will clear up many many misunderstandings and confusion. would appreciate a positive reply jenx. thankyou. keep up the good work !!

--- 帖子 #442 ---
The MA is easy. Just look at the table that comes up when you apply it to your chart. S/r is more complicated. Download the book BSfilter added a few posts ago and read it. It's quite straightforward. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
It really isn't as easy as that. I may only take a couple of trades a day. I watch for opportunities whenever I have time to sit at my computer. It's completely subjective. A setup will occur and it just feels/ looks right. But I always follow the rules. I may start a trade explorer next few days so people can plot the trades and maybe see what led me to take the trade. But I dont want to get any more involved than just commenting on this thread and helping people out like that as I have other things to do. Hope you understand. Thanks

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks a lot for the ebook. It made things a lot clearer.. I'm going through the videos now...

--- 帖子 #445 ---
no worries jenx. I just thought it might, infact it will, dispel everyones confusion once and for all on all matters such and sr, valid set ups, false ones etc. just thinking about making life easier for all concerned including yourself. i thought that a visual tutorial would "home" everyone in on the same page, but we perfectly understand your reasons for declining. keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #446 ---
i guarantee you, that you will need 10.000 hours of watching in front of your computer to get the feeling you need for long term success. no teacher will preserve you from practicing, practicing and practicing. its the same with piano playing or getting very good in something else. and its not enough to be very good, you have to be excellent to survive on this trading field. its a passion and needs a lot of commitment.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I think its more a question of patience. If a trade isn't good value, wait until it is. That's all. You don't HAVE to take the trade. This week I'm starting to trade a bigger basket of pairs (in order to forward test the method on different pairs on live account ( I have no faith in backtesting and have a theory on that, but that's a completely different issue)) and as such patience will absolutely be key. In fact I'm going to discipline myself to only take second and subsequent sets of signals, even if the first ones are perfectly valid.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
of course, patiente&amp;discipline ist the most important part. but this comes only with experience...

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I for one would love to hear your theory on backtesting, as I am sure would any serious forex trader and/or system tester. The more ideas that are out there, the better we all become. just my 2c worth.!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
A bit more complex than this but essentially it goes as thus. Me and a mate of mine, a junior trader with a London hedge fund, first discussed this a number of years ago. Basically the market will ALWAYS move in the opposite direction to the majority of trades, which of course is at disparity with the traditional view of supply and demand. It MUST do this in order to survive. If it didn't, there would be no money. When your average trader makes a trade, he is doing so, generally, from accepted practice on seeing valid patterns, conditions etc. He/she isn't doing this alone. They will invariably be acting within "crowd behaviour" on a "collective conscience". This explains why so many traders do everything "right" and immediately go into a losing position. The market is protecting itself. So when you see in backtesting that when A and B are present and C happens it is natural to make the trade when A and B occur in the future. However, and this is of course just my theory, A and B only resulted in C because the majority DIDN'T make the trade. If they had, the pattern would not have materialised. What you are seeing in backtesting, is effectively trades that WEREN'T taken by the majority. That is why they did what they did. As soon as the majority act on seeing A and B occurring, you can bet your bottom dollar that C doesn't turn up. You could of course, argue that this is what we are doing here in picking out a pattern that occurs over and over again. The difference with our method is that for it to be successful, the trader must use his/her common sense, be subjective and weed out the bad situations. By doing this you are doing the opposite to most, who need a signal to pull the trigger. Here, a signal just alerts us to a possible opportunity, the majority of which may possibly fail if you just trade them religiously. It also explains why an EA never has and never will be successful. Not trying to convince anyone, just my theory.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
All very good &amp; valid points Jenx I'll add to that from a coders perspective of MT4. The strategy tester in MT4 has some major bugs in it which totally invalidate the results. Won't bore you with all the details but will just say, serious coders/traders only use MT backtester to verify the logic of an EA, never to guarantee a profit/loss result. That can only ever be done in a live forward test.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I like your theory , btw AUDUSD today had a few opportunities to be on the right side of market with this strategy .

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not poo pooing automation.It makes life a lot easier in helping identify opportunities. I'm talking more about EAs that trade for you.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I had 2 good ones on EU long.. i have another question (more about the technicality of trading this method): Is the first thing you do before trading setting up the buff S&amp;R or do you set then on-the-fly once there is a valid setup? And if it is the latter, will this not take valuable time and delay a good entry while looking for potential S&amp;R on M15, then, M5 then M1? I know in one example you found a buff S&amp;R on M5 back in July - that's a whole lot of looking and left-scrolling... OTH keeping track of too many S&amp;R lines and knowing which is broken, which is yet to be on like 7 pairs will make you lose track, correct? Just trying to organize my trading better and not to get entangled into a gazillion S&amp;R lines as I used to...

--- 帖子 #455 ---
I set up the S:R lines at the beginning of the day based on M15 ( sometimes the level isn't evident on M15 but is on M5) immediately above and below the current price scaling down to M1 to refine the price level if possible, and then periodically adjust them as and when levels are broken.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #457 ---
absolute brilliant words, thinking and thoughts on this matter! thx! i can only agree.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Thanks for your ideas, it is actually very thought provoking and resonates a lot with me. Backtesting methods or ideas or indicators etc on historical data to recognize patterns will *always* generate perfect signals with ideal outcomes, but trying to replicate that exact method in the real world does prove to be harder than you would think. Your ideas are very interesting indeed!

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hi Jenx, I have maybe stupid question regarding S:R lines. Can you explain to me about validation of your S/R levels? I mean until when you consider that level is still valid and when not? Sorry for my english, I hope you understand me.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I plot my levels on M15 if possible. I don't trade off those levels.I use them to prevent me trading into them. So far as when I consider them no longer valid,,, It depends on the TF; Below the orange line represents support. Its on the M15 chart so I would only consider it no longer valid if an M15 candle CLOSED below the purple line ( the low of the candle that created the support level)

--- 帖子 #461 ---
OK, I see, thanks.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Jagg - Can you please post your setup files? This is very clean.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Been a bit busy with other business so far this week. I've just created a trade explorer. It goes somewhat against the grain with me to share trades as that is each our own responsibility. But I am going to live forward test this method on a basket of currency pairs ( just those that my broker offers a reasonable spread on) instead of just EU and UJ that I normally trade. Maybe the trade explorer will give some statistical info with regards to different pairs, maybe it won't( considering that trades are taken subjectively and not religiously), we'll see. As I am going to be placing more trades than I normally would I feel I need to be even more conservative than I already am. I have purposely masked balance, trade sizing etc as that depends on your own risk appetite, MM, capitalisation etc I don't know how these things work and have no idea whether the trades will show up in real time. If they do and you choose to take the same trade, please do so at your own risk. This explorer has in no way been created in order to give you trade signals. It may, however, be handy to plot the trades to see my personal way of thinking, but please, above all else, develop your own unique approach to our method. It is the only way you will be consistently profitable in the future. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi Jenx, Thanks for sharing this simple scalping technique with TF1mins. I would like to know if we have to see the big trend on higher TF before we scalp on TF1minutes. This is because sometimes whipsaw price happened on TF1minutes. Thanks. -ATUQUE-

--- 帖子 #465 ---
this matter with HTF is disussed so many times already, please read the thread from the beginning.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Had a day trading a basket of currencies using this method and it just doesn't do it for me. I lost 1.3% on the balance and I felt I had moved away from what makes the method consistently profitable. When I watch 1 or 2 pairs and bide my time, I don't often get it wrong, however when I'm flying through a dozen or more pairs trying to identify opportunities, not only is it labour intensive, it loses its edge completely. So I'm not going to throw good money after bad and I'll go back to as I was with my main account. The account I have set up as a trade explorer, I am going to experiment with something that is a variation on this theme. I won't go into it here yet until I have some concrete data. Cheers

--- 帖子 #467 ---
It doesn't do any harm to look at the higher TFs to get a feel, but just bear in mind that we are only taking small moves. It's easy to look at the H1 chart and think its overbought/sold and dismiss the trade whereas a move of 10 pips in that tf is not such a big deal so long as its not trading into s or r

--- 帖子 #468 ---
i agree totally to better stop it and can understand this very well. for me even trading 2 accounts at the same time is a challenge that was not working for me. even trading a basket for others is different then trading just for a living for myself. the edge in trading is so fragile and contains (for me) things like good sleep, breakfast timing, toilet timing, breaks between, physical condition, relationship to girlfriend/wife, etc...

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Pretty easy to see where I'm going UJ long. 112.30-35 stop below 112.24.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Nice one. Remember the FOMC stuff in 2 hrs could create some big moves.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Yup, not looking for a ton on this one because I think it will start to chop before FOMC.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Done +8

--- 帖子 #473 ---
me too. +9.5

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Would it be possible to get alerts added to your custom indicator?

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Thanks Jenx. Will look into it.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Pretty much as easy as it gets there on that UJ short just now. +8. Caught that one right at the top 112.32 and got out when it hit 112.23. Reason - lower BB and clear support which may yet break but why force it with NY coming in.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Sounds to me like you pretty much have the hang of it my friend. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Had a couple of "normal" trades today on my main account. Not a bad day really. Been messing about with something last couple of days and I knew I was onto something. It's essentially based on our method here, but is thinking completely "out of the box". Very excited about it at the moment,but I'm not going to go into any details right now until I've got some live, forward tested mileage out of it and can back it up with solid data. I'm going to use the account I set up for the trade explorer but please remember all the trades taken on that account will now be just me "beta testing" as it were I'll keep you posted. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I developed my own version based on Jenx strategy. Maybe for somebody it should be interesting. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Shorted UJ at 111.94 with half of normal position. Second half of position will scale in at 112. Stop above 112.06 targeting 111.79

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Pretty much the way to do it in my opinion. BB and MA as guide with PA dictating entry. Nice and clean, looks good.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Looking for EU long, just waiting for better entry. Pretty good base between 1.1784 and 1.1796 but may not get there. So hard to be patient.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Pretty good setup for a UJ short there around 111.84 but I did not take it as PA and range kinda suck so skipped it.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Btw, something to consider. EU and UJ have some reverse correlation so they tend to line up for entries at the same time or very close anyway. I look for which looks better as a setup and enter only one. The greedy side of me says "take both, twice the profit" but then common sense takes over and says "If wrong, twice the loss" -protect the account. OK gotta concentrate, Later.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
shorted EU at 1.17682 , out for 10 pips, good setup. have been trying yesterday 5 trade one got stop out for 5 pips, 4 all out with green pips. good luck, and stick to this as is minimal risk as not in mkt for long. when mkt is quiet you can google the 25 mantra of day trading, good to read before you start trading everyday. cheers Bill

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Splitting UJ long entry. 112.34 First 112.30 Second Stop - 112.23 If only first gets filled I'll look for 10 and done If both get filled, look for 10 on first, second becomes a free trade so letting it run. 113 could come into play so that would be target. If I don't get filled then that sucks, and if my SL gets hit then that really sucks.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
@tommy, great trade if filled should have your TP by now. got in GJ for a fast 10 pips earlier, keep the pips coming.. cheers Bill

--- 帖子 #489 ---
one more fast trade in GJ for +7, I am done for the day. good luck to all. trade safe

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Anyone here knows how to develop this into an EA? Although I would not use the robot for live trading, I just want to backtest and see how this strategy performs in different time periods intraday or different timeframes from the past. I know Jenx and some of you have different opinions regarding the effectiveness of back testing but I would like to give a contrarian opinion towards this. For instance, I want to know if trending markets in higher TF increases the probability of this strategy to work in 1 min charts. I also want to see how it behaves during consolidating markets. Moreover, which currency pairs to choose. The only way to do this efficiently is to code an EA robot and adjust some parameters for backtesting. I strongly believe that historical data increases my confidence in using this strategy as my main trading method. Would love to your responses.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Evidence from historical data increases anyone's confidence in using any strategy as their main trading method. This is a great strategy, based on entirely sound underlying principles. You can gain as much evidence from it as you want, with historical data, by manual backtesting. But since its overall edge (just like the overall edge of other successful strategies) stems from the subjective interpretation of price action parameters , you can't automate that. If you automate the backtesting, it won't show overall profits, and you'd therefore mistakenly reject it and miss out on a profitable, successful strategy that has a genuine edge. This is why automated backtesting has comparatively little value, and why people like Jenx who successfully trade strategies like this start their explanations by explaining clearly (as Jenx wisely did, right at the start) that it works well when combined with an understanding of the realities of interpreting price action parameters, to select the entries. There are no short cuts that work steadily over the long term. The strategy explained in this thread is really a very successful bias-determination one, not a reliable entry-selection one: entry-methods are not the same thing as trading systems, and understanding that concept, and its practical consequences, reveals why you're seeking something unrealistic. Sorry if it sounds pompous or pedantic, but it isn't possible to make long-term profits - from this excellent strategy or from any other - without understanding this.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Well said. Subjectivity is the essence of this method however I have spent the last few days trying to exactify a set of entry rules using pending orders based on our bias orientated signals and our method of identifying S/R. Its just starting to come together and is looking very promising however I will need to do quite a bit more live, forward testing to validate and exactify the rules.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
i like that sentence

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Exactly so (which few people understand, and that correlates well with the reality that very few of us in this and other forums are making a living). Pleased to hear it, and looking forward to hearing more from you, Jenx.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Short GU at 1.3163. Tight stop on this one because it is somewhat choppy.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Lost 5 on that one. Thought it had room for 9 on the move down but only gave up 7 and reversed. On to the next.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Really like UJ long from 112.78-84. I will be long in there.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
post some screenshot instead of flooding thread with price levels we do not know about.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Long time nobody posted some chart so here is my one from this morning according my version of this strategy that I´ve already explained a few posts ago.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Thanks for posting. It's appreciated. I'll go through the thread this weekend to understand better this strategy. Bye

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I'm working on a multi pair/multi timeframe dashboard for this method. As shown in one of my charts here in the thread I prefer the TMA bands more than the bollinger bands so I included both "signals" in the dashboard. I also like a "good slope" of the 120 MA in order to take a trade (e.g. no trade when slope of 120 MA is smaller than 7.5 degree). So I included a MA Slope column. All other things shown in the dashboard should be self-explaining. At this stage of coding the dashboard is a "info dashboard only" so it will not autotrade any signals. You can click buy/sell/close buttons in the middle to open a position. You can also click the symbol name (left) so it opens this chart with the desired timeframe (you can set a template name which is applied to that opened chart). Give me a few more days to tidy everything up and I will upload the EA here. Have a nice weekend!

Hello everyone decided to post a trade I took a few minutes ago. Ended up with just a trade for today so far as I haven't been looking at the charts due to a busy day. Provided below are two charts M1 and M5. I got into the trade with the M1 chart but used the M5 chart for further confirmation. By the way I didn't place a stop loss as I observed bulls had the upper hand

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Nice trade, but what was the logic underneath your entrance? It doesn't look like following the usual 'rules'. (as much as we have 'rules')

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Looks ok to me

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I have opened Trade Explorers, to keep track my trades..

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hope everyones doing ok. Just an update on my "experiment". I had noticed on looking back through the charts a very good pattern that was occurring. I wont go into detail apart from to say over and over again price would turn after retracing to around 0.70 on a Fib. The reason for this was obvious. This is where the majority of stops are placed. So I thought I would forward test it on a live account. Guess what? Yep, went tits up. Like I have posted before ,this is exactly why back testing holds no value. Under live conditions with real time spreads , the patterns you have seen occurring don't pan out. The ones you see on back testing were in effect "non trades". Anyway it just validates our method here trading "on the fly", subjectively, using common sense and not just robotically taking trades. On the up side, there have been some fantastic trades over the last few days following our rules. Hope you grabbed some of those yen and Nzd trades. Good luck everyone and there is only one way for me- Simple scalping !!!

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I'm not quite good at explaning but here goes. The other lines on the M5 chart apart from the two highlighted lines (which are my entry and exit) are S/R lines previously set. Trading with this strategy you'll observe that on an M1 chart both SMAs tend to act as a S/R region and trades can be placed there depending on the BB formation tho. If you take a look at my M5 chart you'll see a S/R region between 1.31950 to 1.31920 which is quite close to my blue S/R line. So basically PA was very much helpful.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi Jenx - I'm intrigued by the above... can you elaborate as to why the patterns seen in the past (which presumably are factual price movement?) don't 'pan out'? Ie non-trades... not trying to catch you out, but I guess a lot of TA is based on patterns repeating to a certain degree.... thanks

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi Have a read of my post #450 Hope it explains. Yes they are actual price movements, but were the majority of traders going with the move or were they being "moved against" as it were? Just my theory of course but it does seem to bear out. Heres an example. I once blew a small account with Oanda experimenting on a swing trading method Id thought up. I had grown the account by 300% in little more than a fortnight. I didn't use SL as that was part of the method( and it would have been useless in any case) On one trade (GBP:NZD) I had a TP and a pending order in the opposite direction at a certain price. On one move the price went to that exact price and reversed (on looking back) So why was it margined? The reason was that , momentarily and at exactly that price, the spread went out to 180 pips. So neither of my orders were filled.(Nowadays almost all brokers use what they call dynamic spreads with little or no record of maximums) Just one example of how a perfectly good trade didn't work under live conditions. Then theres the patterns that occur under low liquidity, light trading, that will never pan out during normal trading. You talk of technical analysis. Along with indicators, that's the only tool most traders have in their box. That's the 3 card trick.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Where this method gives us an edge is that the market, industry, whatever you want to call it, has no control over where you make your trade. You give yourself the edge by trading in the probable direction yet at a point where those correctly placed are, in all likelyhood ,being taken out of the trade. You are using sound reasoning, PA, S/R etc but are doing it on your terms.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Good food for thought - thanks for taking the time to explain.... Need to get my head round it.... but I guess any type of order, whether entry or exit, is flagging the traders intentions/opinions in a very specific way. But at the capital levels most of us trade, is it worth the brokers 'flexing' the quote to counter these orders... unless of course many traders are cumulatively flagging the same intention...? anyway, this is probably a topic covered exhaustively on other threads... I don't want to distract this one so I'll shut up for now! Keep up the good work on the main method. cheers

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Some of you will remember anf3fr coding the indicator below. At the time it sort of went against our method strictly by the rules but I've started using it in an arbitrary fashion and its fantastic on the higher TFs at giving you an idea when things are tired out and you can start to look at S/R as to why. Don't know if he/she intended this function when they coded it but it doesn't matter, its a real diamond to have in your toolbox.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi JenX, thank you very much for sharing your knowledge. Can you please explain more about the highlighted portion in this method. How are you drawing a fib and looking for .70? If you can it on a chart, that would be great. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Yes, just last swing high/low. In a down move, drag from the top and vice versa. Pic below is just now on EU H1. I've edited fib tool and added the .70 level and named it "ENTRY" Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Thanks Jenx. I thought you are talking something in the context of this simple scalping method. But good to know about the 0.70 level of the fib also.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
should we enter long or short on that entry point on the fib on your chart?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
No, I was just demonstrating what I was talking about. When I was experimenting on M1 I would wait for the situations would fail (price riding the bands then changing trend) and found that all too often they came back for a good trade from this level.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
It would be a short.Don't give it too much weight but its a handy tool to have sometimes

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Morning all and thank you Jenx for all your good work, my winner this morn, i just check the condition of the close of the candle on the European open and then trade only in that direction and try to get as close to the ADR in pink as possible, or one hour support in blue, 19 pips this morning, i have been trading this way with good results for some time now, i try not to get to involved on FF as most threads turn nasty and sour, this one till now seems very good good luck to all Ray

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Very good. Glad its working out for you. I know what you mean about some threads. I think if the OP ignores the haters as soon as they start you can keep a good useful thread together

--- 帖子 #525 ---
For those struggling picking out the cherries, maybe try this? The default period is set at "80" however I would recommend, for the purposes of our method, setting it to " 2000 " It's best to give overall priority to the colour (blue long, red short) but also bear in mind where price, BBs, MAs etc are in relation to it. Remember, above all, to use your common sense and keep in mind as always S/R. Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I would not make any changes to your original system. 1 min and 5 min have been very successful for me with 30+ trades taken and with good money management can be all you need to make money in forex.

"Trend Guide" is " Slope direction line " here the link: https://www.mql5.com/en/code/13017 Cheers

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I didnt claim it as my own. It's an indicator that I downloaded a long time ago that I came across in my indicator folder. There it was called "Trend Guide" I don't use it myself but was messing about with it last night and thought it may come in useful to anyone struggling to discipline their trades. I hadnt thought there may be a problem sharing it as I found it for free in any case. If whoever wrote it has a problem with it being shared I'll ask for the above post to be deleted (I cant do it now that its been commented on). Cheers

--- 帖子 #529 ---
@Jenx No problem at all. I just shared the link for the original indicator if someone was interested in the source file. Cheers

This had to be the best thread I had chanced upon in late SEP 2017. Tried out the method and get a better understanding with much help from the generous JENX of course. And with a much better understanding and my own understanding of PA and S&amp;R (I had been actively trading FX for ~6 years). Incorporating this method had raise my confidence in my trade and it had been a GREAT journey. PERFECT RESULT in the month of OCTOBER. 100% daily target met with maximum of 2 trades per day so far. Kudos!!!

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Thx IamFED - I thought this thread was drying-up a bit. I've been trying to put these principles to work myself on a demo account and feel I'm getting more comfortable with the method. Could you share any 'tips' in terms of what helps you identify the higher probability trades and steer clear of the more questionnable ones, please?? From my experience, one thing I've started to factor-in is avoiding set-ups where the Bollinger Bands are strongly diverging at the time of the tag, especially after a narrow phase, as this is often followed by price tracking the band for several bars rather than reversing back in... Keep the thread alive!

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Excellent. Not fixing what isn't broken !

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Don't know if this helps. Maybe pull a fib and look at the PA at each level. If you're looking for value , maybe only take signals that come at 50% or greater? Just a thought

--- 帖子 #534 ---
For me, multi timeframe analysis and a good currency trend indicator are keys to success in scalping

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Could you please give us example of "good currency trend indicator" that you use for your success in trading? Thanks

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I personally use one I coded myself but there are dozens of free currency strength meters on FF (use the search) and a couple of good commercial ones that I can't mention due to forum rules ;-)

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Hi Jenx Nice thread and thanks for sharing. Third time lucky but 5 pips is OK for starters!! I've traded all sorts of systems from monthly position trades to 1 minute scalps. I do feel though after been "right" on my longer term swing trades only to get suckered out of the market for a loss I'm returning to scalping. As a trader I have begun to value my TIME in trades more than the actual result. Less is definitely more in my humble opinion.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Keep at it. I feel a lot more comfortable with scalping as you're not tied to your computer. I made a lot more money swing trading (trendline breaks using accumulative volume) but it was so labour intensive that I found my time being completely taken up with trading. I'd done my apprenticeship, as it were, with a very expensive education using the whole array of indicators, and losing a small fortune before the "penny" dropped. As obvious as it sounds, indicators follow price and not the other way round, but you end up wracking your brains trying different settings, combinations etc in an attempt to make them work, when in reality, they never will. Well, certainly not for me. In fact I would argue that they don't have any value at all, and anyone who is profitable using them, is probably benefitting from a deeper seated knowledge and it is that that is actually their edge and not the indicators. Good luck

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I believe quite a number had replied you and provided you with the answer. For me, I seriously have difficulty putting them down in words, hence it probably voice down to what Jenx said, COMMON SENSE . Multiple timeframe helps, price action counts, support resistance, risk reward ratio... How do you feel taking that trade?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Here's a nice trade I took today on UCad. I won't be posting any more charts as it is time consuming for me and have better things to do. Just wanted to share one with anyone still trying to figure out or struggling. +32 pips on this one. Not all this nice and I left some on the table for this one but 10-12 pips is very doable on a regular basis with this system.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I been trying with this system two weeks ago, but I can't get consistence, Anyone who is being doing well could you give me some advice please?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Check out the posts on S/R. If you look at support/resistance on the smaller tfs it becomes clearer. And don't try to take every trade. Pick the better value ones and don't be afraid of missing one. If it goes, it goes. Another will be along.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Thank you Jenx, I'll read again all the past coments, I want to do it right this time

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi Jenx, How far back do you go, to track the S/R. And do you place the S/R at the most recent swing high and low? Because I seem to identify multiple 1-2-3 in between of the S/R that I have placed. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi I have the higher tf s/r marked but just for reference. I tend to look at M15 last swing highs/lows more closely. I wont buy or sell into them unless there is room to do so, and if they have recently been respected I tend to leave them alone. However if they have been well and truly broken they obviously become the opposite! It sounds picky but as its scalping for 10 or so pips they don't tend to impinge that often on trades. And of course, we don't "have" to take the trade at all so always best waiting for a better opportunity to come around. Good luck

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thread went quiet. Everyone gave up ? The method described on post one is a very powerful one and with a bit of money management you can scale the positions to get almost every entry a win.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Actually I use it, if not every day, almost. I keep myself updated about news, I check 4 hours chart, 15', 5' and 1'. As I usually go with the trend I have no problem in averaging up/down if the first trade goes a bit wrong. I use a Martingale style: usually 30 pips of distance and 1.70 for multiplier. Not a loss. But the system is very simple, so people have little to say.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Nope! Just doing what I do every day. As you say with correct MM and a bit of patience, coupled with a basic understanding of S/R and price action, it has to be the easiest way of making money. Good luck

--- 帖子 #549 ---
dont see any trade explorers on it. hard to tell works or not, just have words of few.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Are you serious? It's hardly rocket science. I'll give you a clue,, it's in the title

--- 帖子 #551 ---
no evidence. only words.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
You need to be baby fed ? Try it yourself rather than expecting others to convince you if something works. The most easy way is to load a chart, attack the template and look what happen in the past, see how many trades you would have won based on just the basic ideea and go on from there. Laziness has no place in forex.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
I've been using it but without SL, if the price goes against me, I add other position as @MATRAGUNA said and it's beautiful

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Tried it many times. I challenge anyway to produce an account. Typical of FF. Everyone has a great system until they need to prove it.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
You're right, it doesn't work. You should go visit hundreds of other threads with fancy indicators, dashboards, EA's, and oh yes, trade explorers. Bye, see ya later, don't let the door hit ya!

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Was expecting that. No one can accept challenge. Even 1 account, did'nt think so.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Have you tried it ? What results did you have ? Kind regards, Goose

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Just because you can't make it work, doesn't mean it does not work. Don't be that guy.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
tradeforex, its a subjective, discretionary "system" or better entry approach, so it will not work for everyboddy.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
too much to ask for a TE then. No takers.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
does it work for even 1 person? this what i am trying to establish.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Well, it is not decisive, as I make a lot of other trades, but you can check may 'scalping + marty' account. But again, I make a lot (really a lot) of other trades.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
In what way would studying a successful TE help you? All a TE tells you is how good that particular trader is. Would you study someones CV and expect to do their job as well as them? Of course not. My advise would be to create your own CV

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Of course it is profitable, as are most systems. Just depends on lady luck and attitude in my humble opinion. Only a test from yesterday 1 min EU. No I do not provide EA's before anyone asks, sorry.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Not every traders live and breathe TE, yo. And no one is gonna create one now just to please you and your tantrums. I mean, what's the incentive here? Will you eat your shoe if proven wrong? Will you admit defeat and then leave the internet foreverrrrrrr.... And then come back with a new username? C'mon son......

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Would you invest in someone without a CV. Would you hire a person without CV. TE will provide assurance that it is worth to pursue a system, if it has merit, edge. Or it tells me if it just another hyped up FF system without foundation where sheep aimlessly follow.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
My incentive is I will trade it to death if someone can prove its profitable. Typical FF, everyone gets hostile when someone ask for a TE. No one faces reality, all living in pipedreams.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Don't trade anything to death because all edges degrade, mostly faster than your draw down. Always quit while you are ahead.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Firstly, no one here is selling anything. Secondly, as was mentioned earlier, this is a discretionary way of trading. In my opinion, its the only way you can be successful in the long term. The moment you try to automate a system or trade it religiously, it will fail. I take very few trades,(5 in a day would be a lot). Why would I advertise my results? I don't need to prove anything, I just need to earn enough money to maintain my lifestyle. If this didn't provide that, I would just do something else. Good luck

--- 帖子 #570 ---
if you are looking for investors, you need a trackrecord. sure. but we are in a forexforum?! here to learn from each other, so we dont need CV or trackrecords from the members...

It's a good probability. It's also tested the price that gave the signal.

That's because you are not entitled to one mate, trade more and talk less

--- 帖子 #580 ---
dear Jenx, Thank you so much for this system. I tried your system 2 weeks ago, but on week one i dont have so many time. Last week, its awesome! Here is my result using your system last week. I dont know how much trade ive made this week with your system. Almost 350 trade perhaps. Oh btw, my broker is instaforex, 4 digits , 3 fix spread. And i only play in 5 minutes charts due to my high fix spread :v. Anyway, TRO Modified Boolinger is a great tool for your system , and i combined with martingale ( sometimes ). Thank you!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Nice work. I've always been wary of using martingale, but if something works, it works and you clearly have the hang of it. Good luck and keep us posted

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Very Interesting area coming up on EU. Lining up for a short in the 1.1759-66 area. Lets see if we get there.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Missed it by....that much.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
http://prntscr.com/hdaykg Entries made yesterday and today so far. No sl used as it's scalping and i can sit and watch 15-30 min a trade before tp or if needed to be adjusted. Using only 3 pairs at the moment and they seem more than sufficient.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Nice work there. I also watch only a few pairs (4) the only addition is Ucad, but others are same as yours. Think that’s pretty important especially for newbies, trying to look at too much and not really focused on or getting to know certain pairs and movements. It's the whole "I have to trade as much as I can so I don't miss anything" thought process which can lead to mistakes and over trading. As for today....not seeing much as the moment. EU has some support down around 1.1680-90 so expecting a bounce there and then I'll see if sets up for a short based on our charts and S&amp;R. UJ has made an interesting pattern that looks bullish to me but need further confirmation, tight crappy range right now.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Thats good. If you can keep this up. This could be a full time living. Well done.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Shorting UJ 112.38-47 - $ looking weak right now and decent resistance in that area.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
That's unlucky. Are you trading this daily ? What results are you getting ? Kind regards, Goose

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Good work

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Are you actually trading off S/R or trading this method as is (i.e with the trend?) Not that anything is wrong with swing trading the s/r ( I'm in the process of formulating a very exact method at the moment) only that it requires a completely different approach (imo). Have a great holiday

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hi Jenx and Goose. To answer you both, I do trade this every day and so far the results have been positive. I do have my fair share of losers, but since my winners are usually bigger, I am well into profit. Here's the thing though, when I trade straight up with only one entry, like I did today, my win rate is about 60%. Which is still fine. When I trade a zone, as I should have done today with that UJ short and break my position in two or three, my win rate is almost 90%. So on that UJ short I should have entered at 38 like I did and backed it up with the second half of my position at 47. The result would have been positive. Now to address Jenx, I look for S/R first. To me its the most important thing. Then I'll see the direction of the MA and finally the pressure against the BB. So, when there is confluence with all three, I'll take the trade. I've included the image of today’s UJ trade as an example. Oh, the other ma lines on there are just hundred levels from the main MA. You can see price likes to play around in there. BTW, my main strategy and the strategy that I've traded for many years now is position swing trading. We're talking 4hr, Daily and Weekly charts. Slow, steady, boring. That's why I stumbled upon this thread and glad I did. Won't get into that here though, but my experience with long term trading definitely rubs off on scalping as well. Just for the record, when I do split the position in two or three, and the trade does go against me hitting my final stop, it does result in a bigger overall loss which I really hate. The positive thing though is it does tend to work out the other 90% of the time, but overall the R:R is crap.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Interesting.Nice work. Sorry if my post sounded condescending, it wasn't meant as such. I like your style and from your previous posts you clearly have the experience. I like this method as it gives me time off. I have made more money using other methods but they were much more labour intensive. I sometimes think I should be less altruistic to one method and mix it up a bit but that's just my psychology I suppose. Good luck

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Not so much last two days but trading is not my primary activity. Maybe i should focus more on it. http://prntscr.com/he98b1

--- 帖子 #595 ---
hi I just registered for writing in this thread. please forgive my english. I try my best. I would like to share some thoughts about this strategy. I backtested over 2 month to see what would happen. S/L fixed 5 pips, took profit after touch of opposite bollinger band, not more than one trade open. Trade opened as written in this thread, but additionally after the appearing of a signal candle with opposite color. No S/R of higher time frames. Why no S/R? Backtesting with S/R of a higher timeframe takes terrible long. Dojis ignored and no trades after big power candles. No candlestick patterns, because they don't work here. No one cares of something like Three White Soldiers in a M1 and of course, that would be a fourth indicator (I count chart view with candlesticks as one). London/NY session with EURUSD. Overall 460 trades, hit rate 60%, profit factor 1.5. I was surprised. Things I would like to mention: 1. About 85% of all trends (M1 EURUSD) in this two month were between 30 and 100 minutes long. There are only a few trends who last longer, but they seem to appear on a regularly base. I don't know if this is nevertheless random or if this happens every time when Chuck Norris starts MT6. However, this really long trends appeared a bit too often not think about all this pips. 2. As Jenx said, it works in both a trending and sideways market. I can confirm this. All other movements are a problem. But for the very first test I traded everything for to see what works and what not. 3. Waiting for a spread bigger than 10 pips of the two bollinger bands did not work. 5 Pips worked better. 4. Sometimes there are multiple false signals in a short period of time (less than 20 minutes), where only the last signal hits. I am still working on this issue. The only idea I have, is to wait some after a bad trade. Jenx had written a similar solution, but without referring to this point here. This signals are frustrating. 5. 460 trades in two month are a lot of trades over 10 hours every day. Otherwise a scalping strategy with only 1-2 trades a day would be something strange. Nevertheless with or without S/R I would like to add some rules when to avoid some kind of entries. 6. It might be worth to mention, that the 2 MAs are not the first indicator for a trend. This could be confusing for someone who is new. You can often clearly see a divergence between the MAs and the visual chart. If this happens, what the chart says beats the slower MAs (and Bollinger too). 7. When the candlesticks perform a break through the two MAs I avoid any signal until the situation cleared up. Break through: Candlestick appears completely on the other side. Because this is sometimes a hint for an upcoming change of market direction. 8. Personally for me trading with a fixed 2:1 risk ratio is not scalping. In this test 10 to 5 pips does not seem to work well and with a market maker broker it does not work at all. Maybe a ratio of 6 to 5 pips will work, but I did not test it, because this is not part of Jenx system. The average spread of my broker is below 0.3. Someone here had the idea to take profit 10 pips or to take profit when the opposite bollinger is hit. I did not test it. Sounds good, but I even can't see any reason for 10 pips instead of 9 or 11 Pips. Jenx uses a pattern stop. This is an important fact, because stop strategy is an important part of every trading idea. I used not pattern, but a money management stop, this fixed 5 pips. I know that this makes a big difference, because a good strategy can fail with the wrong stop technique. The possible third approach would be a volatility stop. Each of the three has its own weaknesses. The logical solution would be to combine them to one, but below M15 you need to be lightning fast and this is here not a realistic idea. 9. In this test I got a hit rate of 60%. I am sure that it would be possible to reach a better one, maybe a few percent more. But I am not sure now, if this would lead to a better performance. Because some kind of "rule" is needed to get a better hit rate and this would include less trades. Maybe S/R would give a better rate and a better performance. Hit rate alone says nothing and there is a big gap between a working trading system and staying calm and cool when taking 7 losses in a row. So I tested the above period a third time and tried to use more what Jenx said about trends. The results were significant better, with less trades and a better profit factor. But with only little better hit rate. With that we go straight into discretionary trading. I have two 16:10 24" screens and using only one for chart evaluation. If I would have a 2K or 4K screen I am sure that the results differ because I see a longer time period and in a consequence an other visual appearance of all up and downs. In addition I am convinced that Jenx trading is successful, but almost impossible to copy at this point. 10. Per definition scalping is looking for small moves and has a high trading frequency. You have to be happy with your low amount of pips. The highest profit in my tests were 20 pips, but far most were less than 10. That's what I expected. Of course I would love to find a way, that allows me to surf 100 minutes in a trending market and scalp the rest of the time. 11. Keep it simple. I saw in this thread many pictures where I really didn't know what's going on there. To spot a trend in M1 you only need the day you are trading. Maybe 2 hours before your time or a little more to see what happened so far. You don't have to look hours and hours back to find a trend that comes from the middle of nowhere, because your trades are only running for minutes. From another point of view said, when I am in H1 or H4 I don't care much about a 40 minute trend down in M1. 12. Support / Resistance. There are enough videos out there to learn the basics and there isn't much more to know than basics. Jenx M15 seems to me the right timeframe to look for S/R. Some ideas for all who have still some trouble with this system: 1. If you can't see a trend, there is none. If so sit back, look out of the window and wait. You need only 3 candles to identify a trend. But this is a senseless exercise, don't zoom too much in. 2. A trend appears first in the chart, second in the Bollinger Bands and finally third in the 120 MA. If you only look at the last one , you are later than most other, maybe too late. 3. If you like 50 pips per trade, don't scalp. It is a thing of what you want, what you get and what you can mentally handle. 4. S/R is not an exact science. And when you find a great resistance, but no one else, it is nice but rather useless. S/R are NOT lines, they are areas. There is never an exact resistance, only more or less round about something. 5. My 5 pips stop runs every time into problems, when the volatility is getting bigger. A fixed pip stop is easier to handle and less error-prone. But I must admit, that I think a lot of time how to optimize it. It makes no sense to use whatever stop loss without testing - not really funny. 6. In scalping the trend is not your friend. Here is the trend more like a girl you are chasing after for a small amount of time. This is far not the same and needs a complete different mindset. 7. When running something on M1 I want a system that is easy to handle and easy to understand. When I am trading for several hours I don't want panic every time a signal shows up. I want it smooth and boring like hell. Less stress is more success. I will next retest over a longer period (more than 2 month) and see if it works with other low spread pairs. 2 more pairs should be more than enough, because I can't imagine that someone is freaking enough to trade this strategy with half a dozen pairs side by side. I will not try to improve indicator settings (too much work). Maybe I take a look at stop strategy as well. Thanks for reading. Sorry for anything you don't like. Take care of you and happy trading.

Excellent post and good work.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
This is a very good point. I personally don't take too many trades, but when I see what would have been a potential trade fail miserably, the next one holds much more interest for me, such is the nature of the market. Check out how many times the worst signal of a "failed" trade gets revisited, if albeit briefly, not long afterwards. S/R at its finest !

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Always remember, there are thousand and one signals or opportunities that can come up, BUT it is the trader that make the critical decision to decide whether he take the trade or not. REMEMBER!!! You dun have to take all the opportunities you see, and you dun have to be right. Make Money is right, lose money is wrong!

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Really good report! Thank you so much! I agree that adding S/R to it will get better result for this system. This is for sure

Hello everyone Christmas is coming and how's everyone? Anyone gonna be like me trading through the Christmas festive season?

--- 帖子 #601 ---
As I am prone to use martingale to balance negative trades, I think I will watch from a distance. Too dangerous. Volatility at the bottom (and it is already low nowadays) and slow and consistent trends are the enemies for holi... days. For a pure scalper, though, there should be no difference between holidays and not holidays. Please, become rich and give your good share to any decent no profit organisation.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
.. not correct. markets getting lower of volume and the transactionscosts are rising a bit. the lack of volatility is often the reason why targets get not filled. Up to you-- there is a reason why working people have a rest during this season.. stay tuned Guido

agree sesamstrasse. holidays season is completely different. the vola lacks and the moves are not like they are during normal business days. believe me, better stay with your family or friends and start fresh after the second week in january.

Hi Jenx, firstly thanks for sharing this solid strategy much appreciated I just wanted to ask more about this method of finding S/R if that's ok? I'm just a little confused as to whether you mean the 3rd bar after the one with arrow or if you are including the one with the arrow? When you say the "gap" created by the 2nd bar do you mean from the high of the arrow bar to the low of the 3rd bar is the "gap"? Sorry for asking you to repeat yourself mate! Cheers Josh

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hey Josh Basically the "gap" is created when (in an up move) the low of the 3rd bar doesn't come back to more or less meet the high of the first. The bigger the gap, the more significant. Also best if the low of the first is lower than the low of the 2nd. This is often where traders are trapped as they were caught shorting the move. When price does eventually return to that area supply/demand is created by those trapped unloading their trades at BE.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hey Jenx, Thanks for the reply mate. Ok cool, i've noticed the same thing happens sometimes on areas that are more of a swing rather than a clear consolidation area. Would you find them significant also or only after the clear consolidation? I ask as the swings have created large "gaps"? When i'm allowed to put up screenshots i'll just check if i'm identifying the correct levels with you if that's ok? Cheers Have a good xmas everyone!

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Jenx, thank you for starting this thread. I have tried both swing trading, and scalping. I prefer to scalp and be out of the market when my laptop is off. I don't like to have to monitor trades on a phone app. I like to get in, and get out and be done in an hour or two. This system is simple to follow, and I am looking forward to following the thread after the holiday break!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I don't really get interested in the gaps until price goes back there so whether they were created after consolidation or as a reaction to a pivot point etc doesn't really matter. I try to get in the mindset that what has happened and caused it to happen ,has gone. Even what happened a few hours ago is usually irrelevant now. So its just S &amp; R levels that have been created by real traders being trapped rather than moves created under low volume/liquidity that are not really carrying anyone, just taking out stops and and weak traders.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Ok cool understood keep it simple is the key. What happened is what happened, no need to look into it to much just identify it work with it! I like your way of thinking Jenx thanks a lot mate appreciate it

Thanks Jenx for the great system. I've read the entire thread and was just ready to try today but the volatility seemed too low during the london session. Then there was a lot of news an hour back so didn't traded during that time either. Now I'm waiting for a setup to form. Fingers crossed. How're you doing? Edit: I have 2 questions. 1. Would you start trading 1 hour after major news? 2. How do you deal with a trade that doesn't go your way? At what point and how do you decide to pull out with a loss?

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hey there Just talking from a personal point of view, as my TP will be somewhere in the opposite bands, I like to see at least 9 or 10 pips distance there, more for the pairs with higher spread. I don't trade at all before red news, but after its gone, no reason why not. You can either put your SL just beyond the last swing high/low or at a point equal to or less than your tp. Problem with this is you don't really know your tp at entry as the bands can widen or shrink significantly as price moves. I tend to "play it by ear" and if it feels uncomfortable, I kill it. Try not to get into the habit of holding on to losers, hedging, or martingale. It may work for some, but I'm not convinced. Good luck

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Thanks Jenx. I also don't like hedging or martingale. I tried your system on Friday and got 2 winners with 4 pips each and one on break even. I'm seeing potential and I'm gonna try on my small micro live account for next 2 weeks.

Had a bad day. If someone made any good trades during the EU/US overlap I'd like to hear from you. Here are the three trades I took. EURUSD: Breakeven USDJPY: -2 pips EURJPY: -5 pips What could I have done better?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
I always think when I see price making a concisive move towards the MA area, its probably best to wait to see the PA once it gets near. The better trades seem to be when price is getting tired and still a way off the MAs

--- 帖子 #622 ---
I agree with your explanation but if you could for once forget about the forward data and looked at the chart candle by candle, where I entered, it didnot look like a concisive move. I would like to know what would have kept you out of that particular trade. Or maybe it was just a bad day, no one said the system had a 100% win rate Edit: It seems I could've saved me some pips if I do this. Everytime you get a signal, say sell signal at the top of the bollinger band, you check the M5 chart to make sure the price is not sitting at the bottom of the M5 bollinger band (same settings) . If I did that, I could've reduced some of the losses or even made a profit.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
When I say a concisive move, I mean making new highs or lows towards the MAs. As this is essentially a trend trading method, albeit scalping, we would be trading against a fractal trend within ours. In that case the MAs may well lend S/R.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Thanks Jenx! Simply Awesome First day cruising the EU , UJ and some other euro pairs... A 10K demo is up by 1.8%

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hey Sam, thanks for sharing your results. Are you trading on M5 chart? I'm thinking M5 would work better for me. M1 has just too much noise to filter out. Yesterday I made a 8 pip boo boo on M1 chart, then contemplated a bit and thought about the M5, made a 13 pip profit. I'm using candlestick patterns to enter as well, they don't hold well on M1 chart but they seem to be working on M5 chart with little backtesting I did.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi Vipul, I am not a big fan of M1 , I trade M5,M15 after looking at the big picture of H1/H4 , also avoid major news of course. What I like about this system is it's simplicity and also the human interaction with PA In all my trading I adopt multiple entries and dollar cost averaging to mitigate the risk Can't complain as the account is up by 4% in just two days of practice.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hi There Jenx! I really like your trading plan and thank you so much for sharing it publicly I'm also an SR fans, but I use MAs + candle PA to find my super confluence before entering in M1 chart. I could see that by adding your BB setting, there are couple more trades for me to grab! few questions though... as a fellow scalper, I found that your way of trading is too damn comfortable (where you could go ride bike to the beach between each trade! wow that's damn cool ). I'm a horrible scalper that stick to the screen 9-10 hours a day. Wondering if you can shed some light about how you develop your comfortable lifestyle as a scalper? like may be your house is just near the beach or something so you can run there in few minutes to flirt with some handsome/pretty souls there and get back to make more money??? LOL sorry, I found it amazing as I haven't met with scalper that is not miserable. Cheers man, happy trading!

Anyway, there was a nice UJ short setup just now worth 10 pips with stop just above candle PA (pin): Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Harvest of the day! ( TP not hit due to spread )

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hey mate , nice one. To be honest my trading has to fit in with my lifestyle, not the other way round! There are plenty of opportunities that crop up during the day but the days are gone where I sit in front of my computer all day. In fact, I'm getting far better results not doing so. I'll spend a couple of hours looking for set ups and then sit them out. If I get a couple of decent trades early on then I tend to wander off for the day. If nothings occurring I don't try to force a trade. I have quite a few other interests. I used to play a lot of rugby and nowadays I'm still involved with my local club so lots going on there. I live near Perpignan in the south of France right near the coast so very often head down to the beach and forget about trading. If its a crappy day(not very often!) I may spend a bit more time at my computer but to be honest I find too long sat there just turns into a haze and I prefer to just have a couple of hours, if theres no trade, theres no trade. I also don't get hung up if I get back home and I've missed a "sitter". Another will come along. Good luck and happy trading

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Really great to have such lifestyle! The beach is too far away from my living space. Perhaps I should think about moving. LOL I never involve in sports because of body condition, so I'm pretty much a hermit inside a moldy room Anyway, thanks again for sharing this strategy! I'll be using it from now as a good tool beside my current SR+MA confluence setup. I used to apply TMA in the past, but I have removed it from my plan (as it repaint too much). I could see BB is much better, especially with your settings.

Hi Guys, harvest of today , UC is a good candidate to considerate , UJ awarding a textbook trade before market close... one of the good points is if you follow three good pairs you will have greater chances of setups.. have a good weekend!

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hey. I almost broke even. I could have made 20 pips on EURUSD if I had closed the trade when upper band was pierced. But it seems I got greedy and markets reversed. Next time I'll have a 20 pip mental TP. I'm more than happy at 20 pips a day. BTW, I've set BB deviation at 1.8. I've seen few good trades pass by in the past week because the band was just a bit too off. Just testing out. Jenx do you have any thoughts on that?

--- 帖子 #635 ---
when a system is built on range trend will kill it , vice versa, so do some out of the box thinking in system developement, some times u use filters best of it is using consistent phenomenon thank you

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Whatever you're comfortable with mate. I fiddled with the settings quite a bit and settled on 2.0. As its not a method set in stone and requires a certain amount of discretion and PA reading, why not.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
This what i love about social trading. Questions can lead to answers which can awaken a sleeping giant. The question which caused the response which i have quoted above was excellent because he highlighted almost all of the variations which could occur once the MA is it. Infact, if the O.P. had his rules written down, something most of us don't, he would more than likely notice that certain variations have a higher degree of success than others. If he focuses on that, he might be able to identify in the last 8 years of trading how many consecutive losses that variation resulted in. If he mixes martingale with that variation he might have an edge that is almost unbeatable. what was your planned SL as i see a ton of orders at the top band wuth no protective measure to the upside?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
It's always important to manage your trade vipul. Once the trade had run your way, adjust your stop loss to BE or even profit, and if you are lucky, they become runners... Last friday, I entered a LONG on EURUSD at 1.2044 and once it broke out of the range (2060), I shifted the SL to 2050 and as it continues, my SL also continue to move upwards and now it's still running with my SL adjusted to 1.2170. Lucky runner

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Thanks Jenx Nice work IamFED. I've also seen the potential of grabbing on to long runners but since I only trade like 2 hours a day, I want to be in and out fast. My daily target is 10 pips and like I said, I'm more than happy with bagging 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Nice 10 pips setup in UJ just now: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Anyone active in Asian session?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Not really a ton of trades as I respect MM even if demo , I also try not to trade more than one pair at the same time. Since last week DD has been very decent and but again we are just at one week of practice. Stop is previous swing high ( or closing above the MA's ) whichever comes first , as per Jenx rules but again the system is flexible for your personal creativity , some could even open in the opposite direction based on a higher timeframe ( hedge ) so you can play with it to come up with whatever you are comfortable with Harvest of the day and some quick EU trades - notice how the price rejected the up-move when approaching the mid band good luck to everyone!

--- 帖子 #642 ---
another day with EU hitting strong resistance , after maneuvers on the H1 notice that result could have doubled but I had my share of the "chair" !LOL Another 2% closed for the day 15% since 8th Jan How is every one doing?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Good job man! Keep posting

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I had losses unfortunately. All the pairs were choppy during the EU/US overlap. I should've stayed out I guess. Lost 7 pips yesterday.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
hello sam, any chance you can post your template please? this is the first time i have seen anyone post their trades, even if demo, and i must say, i am very impressed. thankyou in advance.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hello Baraka, thanks for your kind words. I use Jenx template ( Smoothed MA's &amp; BB ). the human factor can never be inserted in a template as you and all experienced traders know , but I do incorporate multiple timeframes view to get a feel of the big picture , add to that S&amp;R zones , candlestick formations , good MM and a daily trade plan for a general target / stop. And most important the psychological effect once you reach the area where you can sleep with trades open or leave your terminal for couple of hours if you are intraday trader then you will be successful . Emotions will mess your decisions and actions. Do not let them interfere with the job as I keep reminding my self... Here is the harvest of the day , +1.6% and overall account profit 16.7% since 8th Jan. You are welcome!

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hi guys, How is your week going? I am done for the day and account is up by 19% since 8th Jan Wish I could walk to the beach like Jenx but my flu is preventing me

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Great job, mate! I respect your confidence to not using any SL at all. I've done twice in the past and it screwed me pretty well. Climbing back up after the market screwed me twice is definitely a terrible experience. and that's all thanks to no SL trading. Good luck, mate! But seriously, don't rely too much on luck.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hi Billyoneer, I never trade without a stop but I use a mental stop I would not give my broker the pleasure of hunting it. LOL So far I did not rely on luck , just a set of rules drafted in post one with multiple entries to do "dollar cost averaging", the rest is trade management , I do move my TP and close out trades early based on PA and daily set targets , so far the system is working fine. Thanks and good luck to you.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Well said. If you were to visit any given desk in the city you wouldn't even hear the words "stop loss". That's because they survive with proper money management. My personal MM is never to be exposed by more than 1 micro lot per $50 in equity (not balance, balance is bullshit and the cheese in the trap). It's all about the margin. I saw someone write once" Money management is the holy grail". Never a truer word spoken. We need to use stops,mental or fixed, in this method because its working on such tight timeframes and unless you have hugely deep pockets, you could end up being locked under water for a long time. That's why I prefer to take the loss when it suits me and not the market ( brokers don't "stop hunt" ,the market does, its how it survives). In fact I never see it as a loss, it just breaks even on one that succeeded. Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #651 ---
I like your positive approach to the stop loss ( breakeven on previous success! ) , some traders call it account protection stop.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hello, could I ask, what do you mean exactly - by the double moving averages are handy when price is already there? Could you please explain? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hi, Just that the MAs may possibly lend a dynamic support or resistance. However, as we know, s/r is rarely a definitive level and more of a zone. The double MAs give us that zone.It often stops you "jumping the gun" when price appears to break the MA and then returns to the trend.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hi Jenx. Thank you very much. I am currently testing and getting a better feel for this strategy, and enjoy this style very much. As I am a new trader obviously I am managing my risk, and in addition, this may not need to be said, but obviously you must be focused and stay on top of the ever changing chart(i.e. the most current prices on the right), correct? Again thank you kindly. edit: Sorry, one more question - It appears price seems to "ride" the bollingers... I'm having trouble on deciding where exactly do enter, am reading the instructions again. Do you wait for confirmation for price to closes out of the outer bollingers before taking your entry whether long/short?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
No. I just look at the price action and chart structure. One little point to keep in mind is that more often than not( in fact most of the time) when price first breaks the BB, whatever price the MA of the BBs was at at that time is nearly always re-visited in the near future. Don't rely on it though as it only takes the one time to inflict the damage.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Ah.. okay, right. Thank you for your feedback Jenx and members of this thread. Believe I am understanding the strategy more now. edit: Sorry another question. Can I ask your feedback as to what is preferred when the BB and double MA are converged to one another? I believe that is an indication of a crossover, and my opinion for this since I am fairly new and cannot discern yet what exactly to do here - to stay out of this movement as well as trades until I receive confirmation as per the general consensus of this strategy, please take a look at my picture when you have the chance, thank you again.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi, I would say there isn't anything wrong with your short entry, in fact a good entry (probably). Always remember, the BB and MAs as well as this strategy at the end of the day are just a guide. You will still need to analyse the price action and most importantly support &amp; resistance to decide whether to take the trade. Just reading from the chart you had posted, the reason for the good entry was that the price after coming down to the bottom, tested twice had retraced back up and possibly finding resistance to form the lower higher for another test of the bottom and may even break lower. But of course you will also need to look into your M5 or M15 chart to determine whether the trend at the moment is trending down, if it is then it would definitely support your analysis for this short trade.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
I saw that one. Wasn't happy with it because the double bottom was formed right on what had previously been strong long term resistance. As its ranging on the higher tfs and clearly approaching a top I'm leaving EU alone for now on this method. I'm currently experimenting on a method that's almost the opposite to this one. Its very s&amp;r orientated using cumulative volume and may incur fairly large drawdowns but through strict MM should, theoretically, be a good one. It's using the daily and H1 chart so is meant to be a fire and forget method. If I have the time this week I'm going to start a thread giving the guidelines and attaching a TE

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Jenx, I'll be waiting for that thread for sure. Do keep us updated. If I may offer my 2 cents here, here's what I do and I'm just starting to get the hang of it so no expert here. If price pierces the top BB band on M5, I'll wait for atleast one candle to close as red (close below open) and I use candlestick patterns to decide when. THis part is very subjective and depends from candle to candle, each one is different. I've also added one rule to filter some trades, that is when you get a signal on M5, the price must also be bouncing from a significant S/R line, 120 MAs or a bollinger band line (middle or top for short signal) on M15. Hope you understood what I'm saying here... Here are the trades from yesterday, btw. My daily target is 10pips

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Good Morning traders! Hope all is well and you are supercharged for this exciting week. have a look @ USDJPY hourly chart , I think it's forming a nice chance to short Regards

The testing results with control points are staggering. Then on tick a bit more shakey. Do you use this on a real account ?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hi guys, Any one caught the EU explosion?? twice in the sweet spots ( MA &amp; lower border of the BB ) = +7% bump in the account it's worth to say that I have been testing on the DAX yesterday but not successful...

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I'm not able to make money with this method consistently so I've stopped and reevaluating now. Maybe its the subjective part that makes all the difference. Jenx wold you suggest a good book on Price action or whatever you use along with the BB setup?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hi Guys, Done for the day and daily target achieved (1.4%) just before the London open! just a quick note about the EU entries , they do not comply fully with the strategy BUT price was showing good PA from the BB median hence entered confidently aiming for quick profit... The explorer is up by 51% since start of the experiment on Jan 8th , last week strong DD occurred due to Trump tweet , never the less all the DD was from previous profits and the general direction of USDCHF is known to me so I simply held. Good luck to every one for this week

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Well Done, Sam! That's an amazing result! if that's a 50K live account, you've made yourself a handsome 25k this month. wow it's cool I believe if someone here laser focus on scalping 8 hours a day (choosing the best hours, of course) on few pairs, the result would be bombastic as well.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hey Billyoneer, Thanks for the encouragement! A positive atmosphere is a must for any trader. To be frank I never really focus more than couple of hours a day as you said in the right times where pairs historically proved to move, only enter when 100% convinced and if price reverse then I try as much as possible to manage it the best way I can. In many cases over-trading will wipe your gains achieved earlier. We just need 10-15 pips a day!

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Yeah, positive atmosphere will give positive result I never enter when I'm 100% sure, I enter when my system + instinct tell me to buy/sell. As for over trading, that's really subjective, I scalps and do many trades everyday, so perhaps over trading is like 60 trades per day (for me), but 20-40 trades is just a normal trading day. I really agree with your view that no need for many pips per day, but since last year, I've been focusing more on how many % a day. it could be 20 pips = 10% a day, or it could be 40 pips = 10% a day.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Nice work mate. Don't lose sight of what is working for you. Like they say, no point in fixing something that isn't broke.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Don't give up. Most people never realise how close they were to succeeding when they binned it. This method is very subjective but it also adheres to the normal rules of S&amp;R. On your chart, draw in lines where price recently rejected up or down and then look at your signals once price gets there. if price breaks the level and you've already set a trade, you have a decision to make. You could ditch your trade and forget it. You could ditch it and trade in the opposite direction ( this wouldn't necessarily fit our rules) or you could hold out if you feel that its a short term test, setting a sl limit.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hi Guys! this should not be tried with your live accounts ever! Bottom catching during major US news Why I do it ? Because practice makes perfect Acct is up by 78% since Jan 8th

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Thanks for your advice Jenx. You're right about S/R lines. I read this excellent thread No Brainer Trades and a few others that talk about price action. They are very insightful. I'm practicing trading just the S/R lines and no indicators according to that thread. I'm drawing lines on M, W, D charts and using H1 for entry points. Been one week since trying it on demo and got 4 trades, I made some mistakes but learning from them. I see a lot of potential. After reading that, your method is also becoming clearer and I might come back to it after I properly understand price action. Before reading that thread market movements looked pretty random but I see the logic now. I can tell 90% of the time why markets did what they did. Hopefully I'll soon be able to tell what markets are about to do cauz that's where the money is lol. And don't worry, I'm not gonna be quitting. I'm addicted to forex. XD

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Thanks Jenx for all your info! I've added a slow stoch, 8,3,3 with just the %D line for additional confirmation. At or below level 20 buy, at or above level 80 sell, and it does very well. Just FYI....your system is great.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Hi guys! Here is a potential short on UJ H4 , top is formed , target is last bottom and stop is above last top / MA Thanks Bryan for your additional filter. lets see how it will play out this week

--- 帖子 #676 ---
My first one....i set a TP because i am at work but turned out nice....+9 pips, i could have had more but because i couldn't sit it out it, it went like this. i'm still very happy with it....Thanks Jenx.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hey Sam, do you think it will go to daily support?

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi Patje, probably US session will push the price further down , but not sure if we reach the previous bottom on H4 today itself.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
hey Sam, very nice one i got in after the pullback and got me +100 pips. btw what happened to your TE? you did so great. I think Jenx has gold in his hands with his method.....

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Sharing what could be called 'subjective interpretation' of the rules. I went short on GBPJPY (red vertical line) even if the MA was up because: 1. on FF I saw that in the last 6 hours the price went up more than 100 pips. When this happen (and I can see it) usually I go in the opposite direction, as 'what goes up, then goes down'. 2. a divergence in MACD Once entered I put in an EA that Martingales the trade and a trailing stop waiting until the trailing stops it. Easily 20/30 pips. 26 at the moment that I write this. Nice and easy, it was a 'set &amp; forget' thing. Thanks to Jenx.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Yes, the UJ did just what we wanted to do I linked an aggressive expert advisor on my TE , completely went south gonna remove it now so we do not confuse new readers. Jenx strategy is working fine with me as I trade it on real funds now but , I have it on myfxbook under S55 if you want to follow it Best of luck!

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Keep this under your radar , signaling a short on both TF H1&amp;H4 I will enter only after seeing a bearish candle on H1 What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Real nice, i will follow it..... do you use this system only on higher TF? i was just waiting at usdchf, i got in.... we will see how it turns out. The system Jenx gave us is quiet diverse i think, i will try some nice longer term setups, but prefer to learn to scalp with high win ratio. If it works long term and short term, you have a complete strategy. Do you also use Jenx's S/R?, It works great I think.... BTW thanks Jenx for sharing, you're amazing...merci

--- 帖子 #684 ---
+ 12 in 3 minutes

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Not been on here for a while. Hope its all working well for you. I gave up on my S &amp; R experiment.Was still trading this method daily alongside. Scalping is definitely the ticket. Just be in the market when you want to be.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Just a pointer for those of you struggling with the subjective element of this strategy. Switch to the next tf up, and mark the nearest S or R above or below. Switch back to your trading tf, and if multiple signals are being generated (ie price riding the bands) look at taking a signal nearer to the line of S or R

--- 帖子 #687 ---
we can try and improve on entries and exits

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Is this what you mean Jenx? came from 15M R zone... nice 8.5 pips I also took the second one from that zone...nice 9.2 pips

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Yes precisely. However on your chart a signal doesn't appear to have been generated, but it should have been. Are your bbs set correctly?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
your absolutly right Jenx....i had the 25 bb settings, i changed it... Merci Jenx

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Hi Maxwell-eqtn What kind of indicator are you using that is showing the white dashed lines? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Great tips, Jenx! For me, the most important thing is finding the structure first and then the signal from indicator in M1. I personally use TMA in the past, but I found BB really helps in finding the best entry at this micro structure level. There will be LESS subjectivity when we've nailed the correct SR structure across multiple TFs and trade with M1 setup. (I use 5 TFs: H1, M30, M15, M5 and M1).

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hey. Good thread. What is ECN broker? Specifically name of the broker, please? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hi Aqwerk, probably no one will recommend a broker name in public as FF admins could label him "commercial" If you are recent joiner to forex arena , I urge you not to rush with real funds and practice as much as you can till you are consistently making profits ECN broker connects you directly to the market , research in google and you will find good ones. or DM me Best of luck

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Hi Patje, Sorry for late reply I use on M15 , H1 , H4 ( seldom on M5 and never M1) , this is what I am comfortable with really , the more TF syncing you have the higher probability it is and if you catch the price loitering around S/R then you have a bull's eye so go for it! Thanks &amp; Best of luck to all!

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Hey Sam, i really like the s/r method i'm expirementing with it at the moment. I also like to be in the moment and get out when i am finished. about the trades close to the s/r zones are great, but if price isn't near them, i get to many bady signals. So i'm working on that. for now i identify these lines on the smaller timeframes and trade the bounces on 60 tick charts, till now works pretty well. and quiet fast some pips in your pocket... thanks for your reply. How is it working for you on higher TF?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Hey Jenx, i changed my bb settings to 20 again, but i am not sure if there are corrert because in you first post you mentioned 25. wich one do you prefer?

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hi No, I have mine set at 25 with a standard deviation of 2, set to close

Dear Jenx， Great work, Thanks! good day! Yu

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hello All Im new to this thread and have reviewed it with interest. Its good to know that what makes it all tick is the common denominators PA and psychology... Jenks thanks for giving me an opportunity to improve. The attached UJ chart is my first trade. After setting a support level (the 3 candles thingy) at 105.446 I made an entry and came out on the M1 MA level and made about 7 pips. Next time will show my entry position.....beginners luck I guess.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
I think more than psychology its patience and common sense. If you look at your chart, although its ranging, the short trade in the middle was good value.I know that strictly, the MA had crossed but looking to the left there was obvious resistance that, at least for now, wasn't going to be broken, and there was easily 15 pips down to any sort of support. In any case, theres nothing wrong with banking 7 pips and waiting for another opportunity. Good luck and keep at it

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Dear sadatta， What do you mean of “ 250/500/750/Big round numbers to be natural SR levels (along with major SR levels based on H1 price action)..” ？ thanks

Hi pumy I think sadatta meant that at 250/500/750 and Big round number are natural SR level, for example 1.2325, 1.2350, 1.2275 and 1.2000.

jenx, thank you for your strategy! i was always looking for a decent simple scalping strategy like that. i'm sick of all These indicators... can you say wich zerospread-Broker you are using? i think there are a lot of scam Brokers around with Zero spread...cheers mex

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hi I personally use IC Markets . They're not so much zero spread (you do see zero on some pairs) ,as low spread with around a 0.7% commission.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hello, Definitelly will give a try will post entries soon!

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Nice thread, wanna test this in cent account next week.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Are You still using this system ? could You share Your temtplate / inies ? thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Hi and many, many thanks to Jenx and others. This is an amazing approach which fully suits to the trading style I feel well with. Tried the system and adapted some S and R indis....first trade using advices written in this thread combined with feeling, luck and experience...result see below. One question: anyone knows how the BB_Simple_Scalp is designed (coditions?) as it doesn`t show any Entry signalsat the stage I went in? Thanks in advance and happy trading

--- 帖子 #710 ---
another trade not as said in the textbook...but playing with S and R....

--- 帖子 #711 ---
What indis do you use for S &amp; R ? They look good

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Sorry Lupus, I don`t want to come to this clean and ethical thread here and overload it with my indis. If the thread starter Jenx agrees and sees advantage in it for his thread than I will be pleased to share...

--- 帖子 #713 ---
no signals showing because you are selling above MA ( you went against the trend in your trade but the resistance complimented your trade and price dropped) see attached example

--- 帖子 #714 ---
But looking to the left there are 6 signals short though MA is green..... and looking to the right there are 6 blue signals whilst MA is red....mhm

--- 帖子 #715 ---
BUY signals only shown whenever BB sma above two 120 ssma. Sell vice versa

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Nothing to do with the color of the MA doerpn. I think the color of the MA are indication of it inclination if I am not wrong. Mine only have a fix color. As mentioned, BUY signal when BB SMA is above the 2 SMMA and SELL signal when BB SMA is below the 2 SMMA. However it can be subjective at times as you had experienced it yourself. You sold when the BB SMA was above both SMMA but did a good trade. It was also explained that was likely due to the resistance above that cause the market to come back down. For me, I look at the 5 and 10 min TF and see if the BB SMA is above of below. If both TF indicated that it is above, then I will look for BUY but if one is up and the other is down, then I either wait for both to be the same again and disregard it totally. Hope it help a bit.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Ill try hope lucky

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Thanks guys, thats it...

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Yes I know....but for me S and R has much more weight than indis (BB and MA)

--- 帖子 #720 ---
May i know do you draw the red and blue rectangle manually or by indicator? and can you please upload the indi? thanks

--- 帖子 #721 ---
It's an Indi. He answered that in post# 712

--- 帖子 #722 ---
No ,by all means do. As someone has said, S &amp;R are far more important than the trend indicators

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Ok, i am using three different S and R indis....everyone has to find out for himself if one or all suits to him... They have different calculations (don`t ask me about), thus i use them together to get hints about important S and R zones

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Hi Jenx, I’m in the US and IC Markets is not an option. With spreads (at best) of 1.1 - 1.5 with Oanda , is it even worthwhile to scalp using this BB and 2 SSMA system?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Maybe can try Dukascopy, average spread for majors are 0.2-0.5 pips

--- 帖子 #726 ---
I’m not so much asking about brokers as I am asking if this scalping system would be compromised when my spread on EU and UJ is usually 1.2-1.5 pips. Jenx, you were with Oanda for 8 years. Your thoughts on if this scalping method would be valid for me?

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #728 ---
I don't think a clear spread of less than 2 pips would negate this even on the M1 chart. Obviously the available distance to a potential TP becomes more relevant the greater the spread. Even now with the commission working out around 0.7 pips, in real terms Im usually paying over a pip.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Generally, when I take a trade, I dun look at the spread or the commission, those are so call the operational cost and can't be avoided for a trade to take place, just like in some business. So in our business, having know there operational cost, each trade when taken should covers the operational cost else that trade shouldn't even be considered. Just my thoughts on trading...

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Dear Jenx, Thank you for your sharing the system. Apologize me due to did not catch your guidance about the entry point we should to enter. Could you kindly help to make clear some points as following? - Entry - Trading session - S/L and T/P etc... Thank you and other for your sharing.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Hey Jenx thank you for the system! May I ask what type of set ups do you look for and which market do you trade? for me I’m trading 9am-12pm EST only. I find that Japan the trading range is too small unless I see something really good I might jump on it. for me 1) no news 2) for a buy B.B. to be above MA and candle breach of the bottom BB 3) for a sell B.B. to be above MA and candle break od the top B.B. 4) drawing lines from 15 minute using trading in the buff style of 123 bars can you share with us what your cherry picking looks like?

--- 帖子 #732 ---
you mean below the MA? London trading hours should be the better choice to trade as it is the highest volatility period. It's best not to trade during news and data releases and generally point 2 and 3 are correct.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Yes I meant below. im curious to know what you ideal set up looks like. I’ve tested this, and I realize during ranging markets this strategy doesn’t work well due to price breach of the B.B. bands happen when price is going above and below. Jenx?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
It's subjective as mentioned by Jenx many times, During ranging market, you have to reduce the pips taking, as mentioned by Jenx in earlier post, 8-10 pips per trade, but those are in clear direction market and in fact you can get more. During ranging market, you just have to spot the immediate SR and play within them. If the range is too tight then just forget it and enjoy your day.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Hi Jenx, your system rule is for M1 chart, did you check it M5 chart ? I want to use it M5 chart, any problem?

--- 帖子 #736 ---
M5 on UJ. An example of common sense and discretion. Price had broken out of a range (the mixed signals told us it was in a range). Price has then come back to test the upper of the range which coincidentally coincides with the MAS and gives us a buy signal.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Anyone struggling with mastering this, then this method may just not be for you. I'm not for one minute holding this up as the ultimate trading system, because it isn't. It is however the ultimate for me personally. I, however ,have no desire or need to become stupidly wealthy from this game we play. I live on the mediterranean with a beautiful woman. Money is ok so long as it helps you stay happy, but it will never make you happy

--- 帖子 #738 ---
I didn't get it sorry. Can you please show your entry?

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Jenx, thank you for commenting on this. I see your entry would be after the big rise and for a buy. also when you say mixed signal, do you mean when price is hanging close or inside the MA

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Price had clearly broken to the upside after a considerable period of consolidation. Anything around the previous resistance ( red line)which should now lend support if it was in fact valid, would be interesting. in this case it showed , not only bullish price action from that level, it was also the level coincided with our Mas which were in a bullish move. No brainer really.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
In the period of consolidation, there were multiple opposite signals, which in itself signifies indecision. Time to stay out until price makes its move. It did, and as we know, you don't try to catch a falling knife, so best to wait and see what happens at the re-test, if it indeed does re-test. If the trend is still mixed (ie no signal) ,stay out. However, as in this case , if it gives you a signal in the direction of the breakout its a banker.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Thanks. It is clear now.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Thanks for sharing Jenx. This is interesting strategy. I trade similar strategy for a while now. Who said that indicators do not work! subscribed!

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi Jenx! Just wanted to thank you for sharing this awesome stratagy man! Worked with it for a couple of days now on the 5 minute chart (like that one more) and the results are very promising, like your way of thnking that a couple of pips a day is enough, and it is! The basics are very simple, and i believe even someone with almost no experience could succeed by following the ''rules''. Thanks and hopefully i can share some good results the oncoming months!

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Hi Jenx, I;m in the midst of reading the whole thread (at page 32 now, a few more to go) I saw that u;re using IC market , i;m using Oanda , Using this method , does it matter if one use IC or Oanda ? I think i read in your old post that u used Oanda before , why the need the to switch ? if u dun mind sharing . thank you very much .

--- 帖子 #746 ---
I have finally read through all .... regarding S/R , 1. when price near S/R , try to avoid trade. 2. When price above S , ??? 3. When price below R , ??? 4. When price far from S/R , the rule of BB/MA apply . Please help me to confirm if i understand correctly ? Thank you

--- 帖子 #747 ---
For me, it was just the lower spreads on more pairs. On EU an UJ for example I don't suppose it makes a great deal of difference

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi I just use the s and R as a guide. If we're right on those areas probably best to stay out but if theres room for your target no reason not to trade into them

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Thank you Jenx , truly appreciate !

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hello Jenks.....I have set the S/R levels on the 15m chart as per the attachment...these levels are on the 123 pattern... They cover just about all the trading area....am I missing something.... Thanks

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Ahaa...the levels have been refilled yes...

--- 帖子 #752 ---
I only really bother about the immediate levels above and below. If one gets broken, the next comes into play

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I think I understand this system now. The thing is to look for break outs out of consolidation and jump in on the pullback. the only issue is NY session has been shitty, but I see that London’s been a golden goose. Tjme to change my sleep schedule

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Been using this system with UJ and EU for several weeks now. Using original rules from Jenx’s first post. Only tough part is knowing when to kill the trade. I can see how some might want to let this go the other way too long, as it often comes back into profit. Just not worth it imho — best to just kill the trade

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Hello everyone... I´m loving and trying this system. Where would you put the support and resistance in the 15min charts for USDJPY and EURUSD for the next days?

--- 帖子 #756 ---
for the next days?! have you read the thread, at least the first 10 pages? every day is new and you need to sort out the S&amp;R. even after a few hours the picture can change and you have to draw new lines...

--- 帖子 #757 ---
I think I will start using this strat for when I already have my entries on higher TFs... Looks quite simple!

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Hi Jenx This is a very nice strategy. Especially in trending situations. I have been putting together different strategies and systems for years but this one is simple but really effective. One has to have a system that suits ones own trading style and I am very much a trader like you who likes to be in and out of a trade in minutes rather then hours or days! I have combined your ema's and BB with my own template which I believe might help with more effective entry/exit (in my own trading anyway). One can exit using break through of ema line or a BRN line Anyway here's what my template looks like Happy trading to all

--- 帖子 #759 ---
thanks jenx for good idea . is it possible to make this indicator multi time frame ? i think if an arrow on h1 and m15 came together , its the bomb .

--- 帖子 #760 ---

i might be wrong, but has your approach soemthing to do with jenx method? i see no BB and only MA. it looks more like CHOROS thread...

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Your're right. I've deleted the post I usually waste my time posting anything constructive on these threads anyway!

--- 帖子 #763 ---
you dont need to be offended. its just the wrong thread.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Don't worry I'm not offended! But it's true that I rarely get any feedback or constructive comments from anyone so I'm afraid I do find it a bit of a waste of time posting regarding technical trading strategies. Anyway, I have used certain elements of Jenx's strategy and combined it with my own ema based strategy. Frankly I don't find Bollinger bands that helpful especially when the price starts trending so that's why I deleted the indi. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I don't understand this. Please elaborate.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hi Samuel I'm online so with pleasure. The strategy (how I read it anyway) is that when price hit's the higher or lower band it's time to close/reverse the trade. Yes this does happen often but usually this happens when there is little or no momentum. Once a pair starts trending in earnest, price will not bounce back and if one opens a new trade one gets stopped out or an existing trade is closed prematurely. I prefer ema's because I use my ema combinations to help access momentum. Really momentum is all important because if the trend is weak one is often hit with dramatic cutbacks which knocks people out especially if you're scalping. I'm sure we've all experienced that! Other elements of this strategy though are very useful. Hope this answers your question

--- 帖子 #767 ---
jmtini, what are the parameters of your red and yellow EMA lines? (Sorry to all for being off-topic).

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Makes sense. Often the momentum starts (MAs not flat), and it comes back to flat to consolidation. The trick is to find the closest entries to BB+MA bounce. Watching back left, make sure the momentum is fresh.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Before you do any trade, you should be aware of where your support resistance are then decide whether it's worth to do the trade.

good system in ranges, when market takes off can rack up losses quick. always found 1min scalping too challenging.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
the holy grail is to detect trending vs ranging market condition. often when it is detected; it is too late

--- 帖子 #775 ---
well done maxpaneplp, at most time the best discipline is to sit and watch... always be very sure before taking a trade... BTW, do focus only on a few pairs you are familiar with. Happy piping

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Thanks, IamFED for your motivation and I will take your wise advice to focus on a few pairs.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Bb+emas are the best way to determine ranging vs trending markets. If bollinger band top and bottom are facing right and they are horizontal than the price will bounce from top bb to low bb. For example wait for price to touch or go above top bb, if it closes inside top bb with a decent size wick, open a sell order with the open of next candle, sl few pips above high of signal candle wick. Tp few pips to mid bb. If price hits sl, observe the bb. See if the top bb and bottom bb are facing the same or different directions. For example if top bb is facing up and bottom bb is facing down than it could be the start of an uptrend. This is the earl entry into trend your looking for. Additionaly you can use 50 ema to filter trend vs range. Other than the bb direction, if 50 ema is out of bb and is horizontal its a sign of ranging market start( this is also a sign that the price is doing a pullback on a higher tf) so if 50 ema goes out above top bb than the price is doing a pullback on a higher tf during a down trend. This means it might range a bit on this tf. Also if 50 ema is horizintal and going through price and close to mid bb the price will range heavily. If the 50 ema is pointing up(about 45degree) and its below mid bb than it is strong uptrend. You can buy pullbacks that get rejected from 5 or 10 linear weighted moving average applied to high. There are other things. This is all from bbma system, i take no credit. Try to back test what i said here.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Not looked on here for a while. Hope everyone's still trading happily. Last few months the markets have been trending strongly so I've found that adding bbs of 15 (for entries)has given more opportunities with the 25s as TP levels.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
I made a 2nd and more in depth check and like to refer to my 1st posting here. I read all the last answers here and some of the assumptions made were wrong. You should test before you write. Doing 10 trades is not testing, do at least 300. Anyway, some news: 1. If your spread is bigger than 0.7 pips don't trade this strategy. 2. Move your S/L to break even after a candle crossed and closed the middle band. 3. Do not trade when the price is running straight through the MA. 4. Do not trade after powercandles. Dojis are no signal. 5. After a candles touches/crosses the Bollinger Band (signal candle), open the trade after the close of the first candle that moves in the direction you want the trade to go (entry candle). This 2nd candle makes the entries better. Signal candles has to have the right color. For the upper band white, lower band black. Entry candles has to have the right color. For the upper band black, lower band white. 6. Do not trade if the bands are narrower than 5 pips. 7. If the entry candle touches the middle bollinger band do not trade. Because bollinger shows you the average upcoming movement, the entry candle should not take half the way to our T/P goal. 8. You can ride a trend with this strategy too. But you need more trading rules. After identifying a trend use the middle band as an entry and the opposite outer band as exit. 9. You will get far better results if you turn some price action knowledge in. The results I post at the bottom here are without PA! 10. Getting a RRR of 1:2 is not possible with this strategy, so do not try to catch the big moves. Results: Profit factor: 1.75 (2.01 with S/L break even and add. rules) Hit rate: 61,68% (73%, this sounds a little too good to be true in the long run, but I re-tested this 4 times with around 650 trades.) S/L fixed: 5 pips Pips per trade won: 5.4 (3.5, this is because of the break even S/L) I would like to test some more things and with other pairs. But all test were handmade and it takes too much time for me doing this. At least I can say, that I am very sure that this strategy works.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I've made a few slight adjustments to your system, namely I've added the 5min and 15min bollinger bands to the 1min chart (i.e. on the 1min chart using bollinger settings 125 and 375 respectively), in order to easily see confluence without flipping in between charts. Little bit messy sometimes but easier to watch multiple instruments at the same time and spot strong setups. I'm also trying out (still on the 1 min chart) using just 1 smoothed MA with a 120 setting (on the close) and adding a 600 smoothed MA, i.e. so you can easily see when the 1min and 5min trendlines are in agreement. Because I've found it so far to be more risky trading on a 1min retrace setup in line with your system, if the 5min trend is saying the opposite (e.g. the MAs are below price and pointing up on the 1min, but the MAs are above price and pointing down on the 5min). Just out of curiosity I was wondering if anyone else has already tried doing something similar or thinks this is a daft idea (I'm new to this)?

good system....i like scalping trading here is scalping indicator helped me alot...i am working in tf5m &amp; 15m on usdmxn /usdtry/gbpjpy

--- 帖子 #784 ---
How on earth are you going to scalp pairs like USDMXN with a huge spread? You really need to scalp pairs with low spread IMHO Anyway good luck is all I can say!

--- 帖子 #785 ---
hi jmtini .. scalping on USDMXN on tf15m work with me(spread 55pips) yesterday i made +122 pips one trade!

--- 帖子 #786 ---
OK - you'd have to make 122 pips on a trade with a spread of 55 pips! Anyway if you're winning that's all that counts I suppose

--- 帖子 #787 ---
I think that using the 120 buffers along with ema cross (can add B bands set to normal parameters if you like) is the best way to scalp

--- 帖子 #788 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++++ Have spent a lot of time analyzing peso, and it's spread. The spread varies from about 40 to as high as 90, during non peak hours. However, that's quite misleading. Move the decimal point one place to the left, and you have the spread, relative to other pairs. Any way you look at it, it's quite expensive to scalp.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Yes so true! I think the problem with scalping (which of course normally involves open quite a few trades every day) is that every time one opens a new trade one takes a new risk! Plus, the broker who has no risk whatsoever is making a nice whack from spread and commission each time I like to use ema cross along with keeping a constant beady eye on currency strength meter. Today USD (for instance) has fluctuated wildly in strength so I think it's absolutely vital to check the meter every hour at least. But on M1 and M5 if one uses ema cross along with horizontal support/resistance zones to initiate or close a trade it could be possible to stay ahead. The other thing to do is bring your SL up to BE as soon as possible Here is a trade going on right now where I am using this strategy. Although time of day is also a factor and with US session about to start, I find it's usually better not to trade at this time until you know which way they are going to push the price!!

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Actually the secret of winning with this strategy (possibly applies to most strategies) is PATIENCE (underlined and in bold!) My problem and probably many of us is that we "think" we see a good entry however it's not based on our system/strategy and it's usually way too early or late. One has to exercise patience and wait for that all-important break-through candle (see image). That takes patience and "they" will try to entice one to open a trade at the wrong time usually with disastrous consequences

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Well nice afternoon so far with GBP weak and AUD strong - great for relatively safe scalping! I've picked up quite a nice few pips and that's it for the day. Never push you're luck in this game is one thing I've learned - time and time again! I have arrowed the relevant break-through candles on M5 chart. It's a very nice little strategy and I'm very happy to share it on this "Simply Scalping" thread!

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hi everyone Anyone scalp today? Just thought that I would post the GBPJPY M5 from this morning. As usual the early morning period can be the best time to trade. Nice entry (break through) candles and important to trade with the trend except when price hits a strong resistance/support level. The reason I use tram lines is because when my low value ema's (hence the price action) is within the tram lines OR between the two, no trade is possible. Using the CCI as am extra filter also helps make sure that one is opening a trade at the optimum time

--- 帖子 #793 ---
yes i am sclaping today and yesterday and the days before. please do us a favour and show your trades with the original technical setup (BB and one MA) or please open your own thread, thx.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Birdland, your last post was in May last year and suddenly you resurface and tell me to post on another thread! I am using the same ema buffers as originally suggested and have added some extra filters and set-ups which are of immeasurable assistance to scalpers who want to win on a regular basis. My strategy has taken years to perfect and I was happy to share it with those traders who would like to benefit from it. It's the usual story of course that some arrogant idiot pops up with some brainless and stupid comment. I am going to ignore you because with people like you it's always the best thing to do. Lastly, rather then critisising other traders it would have been far far better if you shown us a few of your winning trades - if you are in actual fact doing so well with the original BB strategy, which I 'm sure your not, which is also why most of the posters on this thread have just about all disappeared!!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
i have politely told you please to use the original template or open your own thread and you shit on my head. also i never critizised you or your method. now why do you think i will show you my trades?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
I appreciate you are trying to help others by posting your trades but the best way for people to learn one method is if people post trades that are in line with the original system. Your trades are better posted in a general thread or GJ thread.

Hi traders Is it possible to make some consistent pips with this very simple strategy. I am asking because it seems to be too simple to be real. Long: M1 up trend 50EAM over 100EAM (trend pull back between) stoch 5.3.3 - cross over 20 Short: m1 down trend 50EAM under 100EAM(trend pull back between) stoch 5.3.3 - cross over 80 High volatility needed. Obviously you know what is going on around. I mean all reversal patterns and s/r zone add some significance. kind regards to all

My first post in here, signed up today. So hello to everyone and congrats on a great post. Over the past few weeks I've somehow become addicted to this post, so thank you to Jenx and everyone that has contributed to this one. Been reading most things in here for over a year, but read this post several times. Yet to demo this yet as I am mainly a DAX person. But into the deep end we go. This simple system seemed quite simple to me at first but the more I read through the posts, the more confused I got. Fib started to hit a few graphs then multiple sma's and some interesting choices on support resistance. All being said i am looking forward to giving this system a go, but a few questions I'd appreciate getting some information on. Does the ema of the bb need to head in the same direction as the 120 sma's ? I ask because i remember someone asking for evidence of this working (a TE) and then posting an image that did not follow the rules for entry and exit - think someone said the lines weren't going the same way. Didn't think it mattered as long as it was either above or below the sma (buy &amp; sell respectively) When using the 1-2-3 for S&amp;R, and BB are over the sma's, are we waiting for the gap to be filled before we look to make an entry? Or we don't care about the gap, it's just there to show us the S&amp;R? Or is every break of the lower BB a buy opportunity in the buy scenario? we are just aware of where S&amp;R levels are on the 1-2-3. Just trying to get the final things in place so i can test this out effectively. Thanks for taking the time to read this, happy trading - now i will go back to being quite until I have something more constructive(but with membership to the forum) Edit Found my answer in #120.

Do you use here the original strategy? Did anyone test it on higher TFs as M1?

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hi charlie, are you still trading using this strategy? would you share your experience thread creator not posting here anymore, not sure if he changed the stretagy.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Good morning everyone, i hope you are all well and safe. I maybe talking into an empty room here - just wondering whether any of the old posters are still using this strategy and have any long term results to share ? I have read a few of the pages so not sure yet why the original thread starter stopped posting. But anyway I like the simple strategy - I was using a single MA with a BB, the double band seems much more visual to me. I started trading it yesterday so lets see. May the pips be with you. M

--- 帖子 #814 ---
I have taken a SELL trade on USDJPY at 12.19 UK Time (my screen shot is not working) The price rose out of the BB as it came back towards the MA. Lets see how it goes. 10 mins in

--- 帖子 #815 ---
yes, i am still using it from time to time to support my other analysis. its still working, but you must carefully read the whole thread and choose wisely the entries.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
I bought at 106.956 and now jumped out at 106.894, not a big profit i know, but i was not sure how to set the Take profit and as it was already pushing the other side of the BB on the M1, i decided to take the profit. My problem is cutting profits too early I suppose, but I will carry on reading the thread and see if we have some rules on the TP

--- 帖子 #817 ---
to take a profit with this strategy is never wrong. better safe than sorry, or in doubt get out.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Thanks Birdland .... sure I agree, a profit is a profit. And the original poster was aiming at 15-50 pips a day I had to pop out as well so did not want to leave open trades. I just checked and USDJP has continued on the trend and went to 106.750 a few minutes ago. I will continue to use the double MA in my charts and for the moment i will stop trading any other way and concentrate on this one.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
So last week I used one of my micro accounts with FXPro to use only the original strategy... I had already been trading a similar one but had trouble as usual being so undisciplined. So i cleaned the charts and decided to follow the rules.... easier said than done.... because I by accident took at least two trades at the top of the BB when the price was above the MAs (not following the rules). I put in just £200 to follow this, I closed out all my trades on Friday and was up to £207, my bad trades not following the stretgy actually on the EURUSD did cost me money. I will move out the £7 profit just to keep it clean and repeat the exercise this week. And let you know how I go.

Hello. Hope you're all well and trading profitably! Just a quick one. For a while now, I've added BB 200 to my chart and tend to use the band in line with the trend to take profits. I would say though that once price hits the tp band of the bb25 , probably best to lock your trade in at BE

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Thanks for checking on us all. Yes, a profitable system you have brought to us here. Please what is BB200? Can you post a screenshot of the page?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
i think he means the bollinger-band 200. for me jenx, the system itself is perfect. TP i sometime wait for the close of the bar because often it overshoots. and i use the simple 200MA, but thats only a little deviation to the original;-)

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Thanks, Birdland for the clarification and your time in aswering. Once again, thanks.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
here is a trade today for example:

--- 帖子 #827 ---
I use this broker website to do scalping transactions, it is very easy to use: https://my.roboforexcn.com/cs/?a=lxma

--- 帖子 #828 ---
this is spam, nobody asked you to make an ad.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Clean,simple and can be profitable with some common sense.Just gave me some pips with the GERMAN index

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Hey does anyone tried to make an EA based on it?

--- 帖子 #832 ---
It´s imposible to make an EA as it requires discretional trading.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
It's just Bollinger bands set at 200 period.with a standard deviation of 2. Sometimes it's better to keep to the original strategy however if the bb200 starts to widen beyond the trend being set by the bb25s, you can get a nice bonus from the trade. However, like I said, once you reach a potential TP on the 25s, probably best to lock in the trade at BE

--- 帖子 #834 ---
EAs do not ,and never will make you profitable.Ive been trading for many years and have never seen a profitable EA. And I would challenge anyone to show me one.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
In my first years of trading I made a friend who bought a large house near me in France. He'd retired at an early age from the banking industry. He had worked for a large merchant bank writing trading programmes for them. However, the programmes he wrote were to mitigate losses and not to make profits as the banks senior members knew it wasn't possible He and I were convinced he could come up with a successful EA.At the end of the day, he was one of the most brilliant minds in financial programming. Guess what? After years of experimentation, it just wasn't possible. Yes, you could make one profitable in the short term, but in the end, any number of factors would wipe it out, whether it be wild moves, widening spreads or whatever. In the end, you'll only make money at this game by respecting s&amp;r, observing PA, not trying to find a top or bottom and, most of all, money management and realising how important margin is.

There are somme EA that work very well, but they are protected and you can't get them, to use them, you must use there previliged broker and its the broker who activate the EA in your account, you will naver get it in your hand. First that i use is fin888: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/ositek/fin888/6083397 Second one is ATG 4.0: (i dont have a link of the stats but you can find it if you search hard) Third on is net89: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/try...-net89/3498281 i an already in dubai and already withdrawed my initial capital many time, no probleme with them at the moment

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Those are indeed impressive stats. May I ask, without being pedantic, why, having found such a profitable EA, you even bother to come to this site? Again, I don't wish to sound pedantic, but if I were involved with such a successful EA , I'd be perfectly happy with that? I created this thread to share what has been, for me, a profitable strategy for years. Its the only reason I visit the site occasionally, apart from to check financial news ( I look for pairs that rise or fall against news that should, theoretically , make them move in the opposite direction, and that gives me a clue as to whether the move is a last gasp effort)

--- 帖子 #838 ---
i still have capital in my pepperstone account and still trade manually, only 1-2% each month and i would be happy, diversification is success, i love reading analyse from other traders so basically its like reading the newspaper every day to stay up to date

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Successful day, but not everything exhausted

--- 帖子 #840 ---
That's make sense, thanks for your comment.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
The strategy has two disadvantages: - The signal are two rare there are much better strategies from this point of view - You just could come to an waterfall so your other site from the bb will not be reached for long... this will kill your performance

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Tell us some things about SL Where do you put it?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Hi can you post your strategy here pls thanks

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Its all in the thread

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Hello Jenx...nice to see u back I just started trading xau/usd with ur method. do u have any opinion on this thanks and stick around for a while TC48

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I’ve been wondering around spending hours on end backtesting different strategies but was never profitable I haven’t even had my first profitable week yet. But by reading this thread it has changed my whole view on how you trade in these Markets thank you so much Jenx for the work you put in , hopefully I can have my first profitable week with this strategy

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Hi there! your comment really amazes me a lot. when a person trades psychology and other factors come into play. algorithmic trading will always be better and more efficient than manual trading. In my case, I prefer to design robust systems that allow me to use my time for other things.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Hi Guys, in my opinion we just need to find an important level like here:

--- 帖子 #849 ---
And again, some of them are wins, some are losses or breakeven. But price very often respect important level so this is our advantage, I think.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
well, we are all different. and one is born to trade manually, and the other is born to trade with algorithm or using an EA.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Let's see how it will work...

--- 帖子 #852 ---
It was good for 8 pips.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
I found waiting for price to close above 25 sma after bollinger touch provides best signals. This illustration show a trade im in now, i got in little late though

--- 帖子 #854 ---
I hear you there - but it depends on exactly what you mean by "best", doesn't it? When colleagues and I used to trade a very similar system (on currency futures) many years ago, we always found that doing what you suggest significantly increased the win-rate, but at the cost of missing out on so much that it actually reduced the overall profit, and we abandoned the idea for that reason. You could perhaps compensate for that by increasing the position-sizing a little, but that will also increase the risk, of course.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Does it compare with your thread on "3 bar Fractal break" ?

--- 帖子 #856 ---
excuse me,where can i have your template? i mean the bb and ma indicator. what is the setting?

--- 帖子 #857 ---
thank you Jen! This has been a life changing system, been working it for 3 years straight and it’s quite profitable. One of my favorite strategies since I read this thread! Still works like a charm it’s a money making machine! Just reviving the thread for new readers- yes the strat works and it’s well tested. Cheers thanks again Jen for giving this away much love.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Hi GreenNumbers thanks for posting your experience with this methodology. I would be interested to hear more detail eg what instruments you trade, what times you trade and anything else you are happy to share.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
hey fellow trader! I use this strategy on gu,eu,uj and gj on the 1m time frame for scalping! I usually pick 4-5 points on usd pairs and 8-10 on jpy pairs! it’s a fairly easy scalping strategy I use it on all sessions whenever I see a trend! Eventho the indicators are lagging! Candles will firstly let you know the trend and I just want to pick a few points so being on a lag doesn’t matter! Just be careful of traffic like supper and resistances, pdh, pdl, opens, swing highs/lows! Let me know if you want to know more! Cheers mate.
