There's an interesting technique being used in the thread here that describes a system for trading using Inside Bars on the 30M charts. ( Hmm, that thread just got deleted and all that good stuff is now in the bin. Shame on Forex Factory ). The owner of the thread would like to keep it 'pure', so this thread is a companion thread that takes the pure system and suggests improvements or alternative ways of working. Hopefully we can come up with a new system that enhances the current one. Everyone is welcome to discuss the IB technique. In particular, it would be interesting to hear what works, and doesn't work, for you. Ultimately, my personal goal is to create an EA that can work based upon the IB technique. ==== Attached is the latest EA. I'll always place it in the first post from now on. These are the properties in the EA and the defaults. // The Magic Number used to identify our trades. extern int magicNumber = 20081224091300; // Print the programs debug comments. extern bool Debug_Mode = false; // The lot size used in each trade. MUST be a multiple of TWO. extern double LotSize =0.02; // ATR Period, 40 might be good on EURUSD extern int ATRPeriod = 20; // The maximum number of bars that we will look back to find a recent IB. Includes the two bars forming the IB. extern int MaxBars = 6; // ** The maximum size of Outer/Containing IB bar. Keep it high, works better. extern int MaxIBSize = 6000; // ** The minimum size of Outer/Containing IB bar. extern int MinIBSize = 100; // ** The maximum deviation allowed when we open an order. This avoids opening a trade when price jumps between ticks. extern int MaxStart = 40; // The TP profit factor. If this is 2, then the TP will be doubled, etc. Higher this is the more losers you'll get. extern int TPFactor = 1; // The minimum volume required for us to trade. Doesn't seem to affect trade win ratio extern int MinVolume = 6; // ** The number of PIPs that our InsideBars are offset from trigger IB. extern int BarOffset = 30; // True if we want to only trade long when above daily pivot and short below it. extern bool UsePivotIndicator = false; // Do we want to follow trends or just fixed TP. extern bool TrailTrends = true; // What factor of ATR we want to trail trends with extern double TrailATRFactor = 0.5; // ** The minimum value that the ATR should return; Determines min TP. extern int MinATR = 10; // Do we want to use the external indicator extern bool UseExternalInd = false; // Stick anything in here and it will be passed to the external indicator. extern string ExtIndParams = "Params for external indicator"; // True if we want to use the Inner Bar for breakout, rather than the traditional Outer Bar extern bool UseIBForBreakout = false; // True if we want to ignore the first IB breakout and only take the subsequent ones. extern bool IgnoreFirstIBBreak = false; // Trail the SL with price changes before the first TP has happened. extern bool UseTrailingSL = true; // True if we want to use Stochiastic measure extern bool UseStoch = false; // The value of the Stochastic offset (used to determine the upper SELL and lower BUY bands) extern int StochOffset = 20; // Trading Hours by day - See attached spreadsheet for calculation of this. // Uses the BAR time. extern int TradingHoursSunday = 16777215; extern int TradingHoursMonday = 16777215; extern int TradingHoursTuesday = 16777215; extern int TradingHoursWednesday = 16777215; extern int TradingHoursThursday = 16777215; extern int TradingHoursFriday = 16777215; extern int TradingHoursSaturday = 16777215; Anything with ** in the comments needs to be adjusted for brokers that use 4 digits and not 5. (Divide by 10 for 4 digit brokers) ==== There is a generic interface that allows you to write your own code that will help the EA decide whether a trade is valid or not. To get started: Put the attached IBTrader EA in the experts directory of your MetaTrader installation. Put both IBTrader-Ind files in the experts\libraries directory of your MetaTrader installation. Restart MetaTrader and you're off. To create your own indicators you will need to edit the IBTrader-Ind.mq4 file and add your own logic. An example RSI indicator is included. If your indicator needs parameters then you can pass them into the indicator through the EA string property ExtIndParams . You will, of course, need to parse the string if you have multiple parameters. Make sure that the EA property UseExternalInd is set to true otherwise your new routine will not be called.

So what are Inside Bars? Simply put it's where a bar on the chart closes with a lower high and a higher low than the previous bar. But what is it really? It's a point of consolidation. The current trend has stopped and there's a moment of indecision as the currency fluctuates between a previous high and low. So what causes it? Anything and everything. All we know for sure is that the current trend has paused. It could have hit a point of support or resistance where there is enough buying or selling pressure to stop it going further. It could be that there is an overbought or oversold condition. It could be there's a news release imminent and the market is waiting, etc., etc. What happens next? Ideally, a new trend starts that breaks the bounds of the Inside Bar and goes on for a few hundred pips. What does the system do? Using an indicator, the system will show where Inside Bars form. If you follow the pure Inside Bar trading technique you will identify which trend you want to follow (Bullish or Bearish) and set up a trade when it goes 'your' way. The pure Inside Bar technique has a number of questions to ask to help you choose which trend you should follow. Anything similar to the Inside Bar trading technique? Yes there is. The trend follower system also attempts to pick up on points of consolidation. See http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...54&amp;postcount=1 I suspect that most trending systems all rely on their indicators to determine when a new trend is forming after consolidation. Is it new? No, it's an old technique for following price action. Does it work? Yes it does, but it can fail. Following the pure IB technique is supposed to improve your chances of picking winning trends.

The pure IB trading technique uses what is called the Trend of the Moment (TOM) to help determine which way you should trade. The idea is that you trade with the TOM. But what is the TOM? Good question, personally I'm not sure and this is very subjective. Within the pure IB system I understand the TOM to be the most recent major trend on the 30M chart. If you look at other chart timescales, then the TOM may well be different, in fact the pure IB technique suggests that you also look at a larger timeframe to determine the major trend and, if you're unsure, only trade if the TOM and major trend point the same way. (So for the pure IB technique you can probably ignore TOM and safely trade the major trend?) This sounds great in theory. We have some rules to help us trade. However, in practice it's not quite as simple. If we are trading with the TOM, then it's likely that the TOM has already moved a few hundred pips. So how much room is left in this movement? We don't know. What we can do is look at other indicators or techniques to help. One possible one is Elliot Wave theory. If we find the IB has formed as Stage 2 of an EW, then we can assume that following the TOM will be EW Stage 3, which is a good stage to follow. If we're in an IB at EW Stage 4, then prepare for a trend reversal if you go with TOM. When writing an EA, TOM is not that easy to do, so a different indicator is needed.

The pure IB technique warns you against trading before news or a session opening. In fact, these are good warnings for any system. Why? Well, during these times, the market can behave 'irrationally'. By that I mean it seems to go against current trends and defy all your indicators! How does the pure IB system help us identify news or session opens? It doesn't, and anyone who suggests an improvement to use an indicator is flamed for it (hence this thread). If you have any good news and session time indicators in use, then please mention them here. I've used the indicator from here http://www.forex-tsd.com/news-signal...tml#post215104 This works well enough and has session open and dynamic news on the chart - exactly what you want. However, for me, it seems to cause MetaTrader to hang every now and again, so I'm looking for something simpler. As far as the plan to use an EA, then I can code in session open times easily enough, but news is more awkward and would need to use use the same technique as this indicator. The indicator reads this sites forex news page and displays the results.

The pure IB technique trades on a 30 minute chart (with some unspecified plan to move onto hourly charts). Why 30M? The idea is that a 30M chart shows Inside Bars that have a manageable price distance between their bounds. For the financially challenged (and I'm one of them) running IB on a daily chart is potentially too risky as the distance between the IB's forms your SL. Obviously, the greater the chart timescale, the greater the potential price distance between the upper and lower IB bounds. Another factor to think about is that as you trade on shorter timescales, the trends are less clear, they become more susceptible to individual market movements. However, shorter timescales increase the number of IB's forming, so you have more choice and can pick and choose which ones to trade with. If you use IB's on different timescales, then let us know how you are getting on.

The pure Inside Bar technique suggests that you avoid trading near the Daily Pivot Point. The DPP is a value that indicates the days average price. I'm not sure how it's calculated, but I'm guessing it's based around yesterday's average price (since today has not yet happened :-) Humorously, the pure IB technique does not, at the time of writing, include this indicator as part of it's list of downloadable indicators on the first page of the thread. You can pick it up from later on in the thread, though, and it may be that it is included as a default indicator in MetaTrader (not in my version). So why avoid the DPP? The DPP, as with the Support and Resistance levels that are also shown in the indicator, form a transitional barrier. Trends can stop at these barriers and reverse, they can also blast straight through them. By avoiding following a trend that starts close to a level you avoid the risk that it will immediately reverse. However, levels are broken all the time, you need to look not just at the level, but what the price range is between them. If the previous days action was low with little price movement, then the levels will be closer together the next day. It may well be that these levels will be broken on a new day. Levels are also a good place to take profit in anticipation of a bounce back. The pure IB method does suggest this. So, this is another indicator that, in itself, cannot be used in an EA. The EA needs a little more to go on. Any suggestions? As an aside, why do the support and resistance levels actually stop a trend? My theory is that since these are common indicators and everyone uses them as TP or SL they affect the price action in and of themselves. Self-fulfilling, in other words.

The pure IB system opens a trade when the price breaks the upper or lower bounds. Within the forum, a number of people, including the thread owner, will open two trades at this point. They will close the first based upon the ATR or at a Support level. I'm not sure what the benefit of running two trades is, but perhaps it is a limitation of their trading platform? If you use MetaTrader, then you can close a trade and specify how much of the trade you want to close by altering the lot size before you hit the close button. So, rather than running two trades, and risk missing a few pips between opening the first and second trades, open one trade with the total lot size of both trades.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
When an IB forms, you can follow the pure IB technique and determine which trend you want to follow (Bearish or Bullish). If you have confidence in the pure trading technique, then at this point you could set up a Buy Stop or a Sell Stop (or both, if you are willing to follow a trend either way). Buy and Sell stops are pending trades. They are triggered on the brokers server when the prices hits the stops price. This means that you can leave your PC and don't need to watch the chart to see when the price breaks. One potential downside of pending trades is that you are not watching the current price action, so may miss something that would cause you not to place a trade. You can also place a time limit on the pending trade, so that if it's not triggered within, say, four bars (2 hours on a 30M chart) then the pending trade is cancelled. So if your trade is triggered and you're not watching the chart, how do you know when it's reached your TP point? What you can do is set a Trailing Stop to be the same as the TP-entry point. When the TS is hit, MetaTrader can be configured to 'bleep' so you get an indication that you've hit your TP and can take half the profit. If you are running two trades then you probably don't need this, though the second trade should still have the trailing stop defined.

OK, so what is the raw trading potential of this system? By raw , I mean ignoring the pure IB questions, what happens if we take every trade as it breaks the IB. Well, here are some results that I have backtested for the month of December, probably one of the toughest months for any system. EURUSD 122 trades, 86 winners (70%) USDJPY 122 trades, 76 winners (62%) EURGBP 104 trades, 62 winners (60%) Brilliant, how can we lose! Well, lose we did. Following the pure IB rules, our TP is the current ATR value. As a quick setup the second TP was 2*ATR. In many cases, the ATR is far lower than our SL, so the Risk Reward ratio is, say 2:1, i.e. we risk 2 lots for every 1 lot gained. Still, an EA does show some potential. So what's next for this EA? Look at the best values for TP. I think the ATR may be too conservative, I'll look at setting it to the same as the SL. Enable it to trail the trend. Our second TP is fixed at 2*ATR, it would be nice if we could trail an ongoing trend. Whilst this is relatively easy to code, what should the trail value be? We want to avoid any minor price action that takes out out trailing stop before the trend is complete. Again I'm thinking it should be the same as the SL. Look at implementing some of the pure IB rules (questions). This may help reduce our losing trades. If you have any ideas on these points, then let me know. === Attached is the compiled EA, it's a work in progress but you can run some tests with it. DON'T run it in a live environment! Use at your own risk, etc.

Trading when there is low volume can be tricky. Why? When there is low volume, individual market moves can have a greater effect. What do we class as low volume? Hmm, another subjective question. Let's take a step back. Volume should be the measure of the total amount of currency in any price movement. This should give an indication of the weight or pressure behind any movement. If there is large volume, then a movement looks strong. However, in the currency markets volume is not tracked like the stock markets. Volume is actually a measure of how many times the price changes within a certain period, i.e. the count of ticks. So large volume means that the price is changing continually, but doesn't actually indicate the currency amounts behind the change. So, can we still use it? Yes, but it's not as good an indicator as it could be. For me, I'm wary of trading in low volumes, but don't discount it. What do we class as low volume? Ahh, back here again. For me, low volume is anything below 600 ticks/30 minutes. That's 20 price changes a minute. Note that this is different for each currency pair. Look back over the price history and set a figure that suits that currency. Obviously, during holiday periods the volumes will be lower. Why this figure? Two reasons, firstly, when the market is open and moving they generally are well above this figure and secondly, anything below this figure seems very slow when watching trades to scalp a few pips. It's easy to add a volume indicator to your chart. The pure IB method does not use a volume indicator, but the forum generally suggests not to trade in low volumes. So stick it on your chart and set a line at the 20 ticks a minute mark (or a value that suits you).

The pure IB technique uses the ATR indicator as a Take Profit guide. Specifically, the pure IB technique suggests pulling half your profit at the ATR point and the remainder at 2xATR. It also suggests using Support and Resistance levels, but lets concentrate on ATR. So what is ATR? ATR is the Average True Range. The True Range is an attempt to determine actual bar heights (High-Low) by taking into account Gaps. A Gap is where the closing price of the previous bar is above (below) the High (Low) of the next bar. The ATR is calculated by averaging the True Range over a number of bars. Why is it used? A good question that has not been answered in the pure IB forum. What averaging period is used? The pure IB method uses a 20 bar averaging period (10 hours on the 30M chart). Why 20? Good question, I don't know. Presumably someone ran a few tests and found 20 a good figure. I'm not sure if it should be the same value across all currencies...

Hey 1KA, Yeah the crew at inside bar previous thread tattled on me as well Where are you at, I am in the US.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I don't know if you're looking for input, but if you are, here's my 2 cents. I think you're wasting your time on IBs. I've seen a couple of computer runs on candle formations, and they both indicated that the IB had no predictive properties. These were done on futures and not forex. There may be a difference, but I doubt it. The results you show tend to back this up. On a random coin toss entry, with a SL twice the size of a TP, you will get about 67% wins. That appears to be what you got. You'll lose money because of the overhead of the spread.

Here think pip, the IB on the euro from about 2 hours ago or so

--- 帖子 #17 ---
One of the hardest things to do when trading, with or without an EA, is to determine where TP should be. As discussed previously, the pure IB method uses ATR and Support/Resistance levels. But how good is ATR when used with an EA? To find out I ran a few tests with different multiples of ATR and, as a comparison, using the SL value (i.e. the size of the IB). ATRx1/2 EURUSD 145 Trades, 126 Wins (87%), £119 ATR EURUSD 102 Trades, 71 Wins (70%), -£ 21 SL EURUSD 109 Trades, 84 Wins (77%), £ 49 So, ATR looks good on EURUSD, but isn't as good as a SL value. ATRx1/2 is better over this range when nothing else is considered . Note that the results using 'ATR' follow the the pure IB method (i.e. take 1/2 profit at ATR and 1/2 at ATRx2). The ATRx1/2 halves these values (i.e. take 1/2 profit at 1/2 ATR and 1/2 at ATR).

Thanx Sir for sharing your affort and give clear explanation for hole thing i like your way of explenation.. u mast be Teacher or so one thing i want to know and if u dont mind to explain it to me with Picture WHAT U MEAN BY low volume is anything below 600 ticks/30 minutes . That's 20 price changes a minute. thanx too much

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Attached is a picture of the volume indicator. You can see a line at the 600 mark. Anything below this could be considered low volume, anything above is high. In this chart, from todays EURUSD 30M, there is a clear distinction between low volume and high volume. Perhaps the low range should be adjusted higher for this currency to, say, 800.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Thanx 1Ka for quick answer.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
You may well be right and I appreciate the comments. Bear in mind that there's nothing currently in the EA that determines if a breakout from the IB is good. There are some things that we can do to try and reduce the number of false breakouts that lead to losses ( he says optimistically ).

Here's a quick run for USDJPY. USDJPY ATR*1/2 128 Trades, 102 winners (80%), -£39.96 USDJPY ATR 97 Trades, 64 winners (66%), £0.64 USDJPY SL 102 Trades, 84 winners (82%), £0.87 So, this time the 1/2 ATR was still better (more winning trades) than the ATR. It does seem to indicate that smaller TP is better. More testing required on this.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
out for +16

--- 帖子 #26 ---
For example not take an inside breakout when the trigger bar is double the ATR? Cause then it´s not consolidating, just "normal" but less than the "spike". If ya know what i mean

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Actually, that's not a bad idea. Currently I can restrict the EA from trading if the IB is over a set value, but perhaps it can be based around a multiple of the ATR and the trigger bar. I'll investigate. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
So what happens if we restrict trades based upon the size of the IB (i.e. the High/Low range when an IB is formed)? I was curious to see if there was any correlation between IB size and winning trades. Here are the results from trades on EURUSD taking profit at 1/2 ATR and Full ATR: IB Limit 600, 145 trades, 126 wins (87%), £119.16 IB Limit 100, 141 trades, 120 wins (85%), £67.11 IB Limit 80, 134 trades, 113 wins (84%), £19.99 IB Limit 60, 114 trades, 92 wins (81%), £-15.25 IB Limit 40, 87 trades, 70 wins (81%), £12.11 IB Limit 20, 15 trades, 8 wins (53%), £0.34 Looking at the results there does seem to be a simple correlation between IB size and losing trades. Disregarding the IB Limit 20 result, there is a tendency for the number of wins to decrease slightly, but nothing major (i.e. regardless of IB size, the percentage of wins remains within 6%, probably statistical error). Note that we're interested in percentage wins, the profit figure is included only to indicate there is profit. This figure will become important as we try to reduce losing trades.

Firstly I think it's great that you have taken this thread forward,and we can discuss Ibs without being told to f**k off. I normally don't trade that often and will trade pin bars,at swing highs ,swing lows on 4 hr chart or daily.But sometimes the stops can be huge, so I think this Ib method has real potential,they do work ,and I have been getting similar win ratios to the one's you have posted on various pairs. For me what seems to work well is to take 20 profit and let the rest run,but manage it on 4 hr so you don't close your trade out to early,and when it's realy going in your favour use the 10 day moving average as your exit.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
The pure IB method uses a 30 minute timescale. What effect do other timescales have? Running the EA we get: EURUSD 1M 1267 trades, 912 wins (71%), -£134.85 EURUSD 5M 2694 trades, 2109 wins (78%), -£391.19 EURUSD 15M 2179 trades, 1743 wins (79%), -£393.72 EURUSD 30M 783 trades, 658 wins (84%), £57.19 EURUSD 1H 880 trades, 716 wins (81%), -£189.15 EURUSD 4H 282 trades, 117 wins (84%), £223.01 EURUSD 1D 42 trades, 21 wins (57%), -£95.51 So again, disregarding the extremes, an 80% win ratio for most timescales indicating that timescale is not much of a factor (i.e. doesn't really change the win ratio). Note that these results have been done over 12 months, and not previous one months timescale. This is to improve the results, statistically speaking, for the higher timescales.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks sebby. Do you set up on the 4HR IBs, or use the 30M IBs? Also, after taking 20pips, do you reset the SL to your break even? I'm always looking for good exit points and an MA may be something I can use in the EA.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I've only being testing this strat out on demo for just over a week,the win ratio's are there,we just need to find the best way to get the most out of each trade. The set up I have been using has been Ibs on 30 min,take some off at plus 20 and set stop loss to -5 and let it run,and depending on the momentum of the trade,switch to 4 hr chart to manage trade if current bar is over/under 10 day moving average (not going through it},and exit when price crosses ma you will get a lot of good trades and some of them will be huge

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thanks, I shall bear this in mind when writing the exit strategy for the EA. My initial attempts at using a trailing stop don't really get the best out of major trends, as they go back and forth whilst trending and hit the SL before the trends finished.

Thanks Gustav for the IB thread on BabyPips. I'll read this and compare it to the Pure IB technique. The stochastic mention has already interested me as it's not readily discussed in the pure IB forum.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Scraped a win on this one. Would have lost if I was using the full ATR before taking profit. 4 for 4.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
So to recap. The EA does not check whether an IB is valid or not. I'm currently trying to see what effect various settings have on the win ratio, maintaining profit will come later as we try to reduce losing trades. Taken individually, then: Timeframe doesn't seem to matter. IB Size doesn't seem to matter. TP setting does matter, an initial TP at 1/2 ATR gets more consistent wins. I'll investigate trading at low volume and seeing if an IB breakout 2 bars in is different to one later on. The hard part is trying to determine if any of the above have adverse effects upon each other. And only then will I look at setting rules to try and pick the best trades.

It is good to see your EA working succesfully so far . Thanks 1ka for the work to develop it . I just put the EA on the chart &amp; do not know if it works , if it need any indicator to work ?

Are you using the default settings on EA for the trades you posted? I have been running several back test on EUR/USD and had to set Min volume at 100 in order to pick up more trades. Using a HMA indicator set at 80 on a 4 hr chart but running EA on a 1/2 hr chart. Making only long trades when HMA is moving up and short trades when it is moving down. Winning % without indicator Short 63% long 78% Profit 147.40 12/08/08 to 1/12/09 Winning % with indicator Short 81% long 77% Profit 195.71 Short only 12/8/08 to 12/23/08 Long only 12/23/08 to 1/12/09

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Fontu, just be careful with the EA - it is dumb, it does no analysis to see if the trade will be good or not. Don't use it on a live account, it WILL lose you money as the Risk/Reward is about 4:1 or more. You might have many winners, but the losers will break the bank. The EA uses no indicators. The version I posted can be put on any timeframe but will use 30M regardless. I think that version is also using the value of SL as it's TP point. Keep watching the thread. I'm planning to see if we can reduce the losing trades and this improve the Risk/Reward.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
hanks 1ka for the information , yes I placed it on demo only now . Hope it will come up with success , if can avoid false breaks it should be positive for every trade. Only 1 pip certainity can do a great EA. manualy I traded many trades all with positive result at random without any time factor ,for any insider bar I see when have time to follow it.great system no doubt. Thanks , fontu

I'm pleased people are interested in this. Attached is the latest version - please don't use it on a live account it will lose money I've recompiled the EA so that the defaults are the ones that have proven to be best during testing so far. The EA properties are as follows: Debug_Mode = true; // Print the programs debug comments. LotSize =0.02; // The lot size used in each trade. MaxBars = 4; // The maximum number of bars that we will look back to find a recent IB MaxIBSize = 6000; // The maximum size of IB bar. MaxStart* = 100; // The maximum deviation allowed when we open an order TPFactor = 1; // The TP profit factor. If this is 2, then the TP will be doubled, etc. MinVolume = 6; // The minimum volume required for us to trade. BarOffset* = 30; // The number of PIPs that our InsideBars are offset from trigger IB. TrailTrends = false; // Do we want to follow trends or just fixed TP. MinATR = 10; // The minimum value that the ATR should return; Note that no other indicators are required for this EA to run. This version will use the timeframe of the chart it is placed upon. It uses the ATR to get profit and with a TPFactor of 1 will take 1/2 lot size at 1/2 ATR and the remainder at full ATR. Also, I use Alpari which has a 5 digit point size. If you are on 4 digit points, then divide the asterisked (*) parameters by 10. It's a work in progress, it's unsupported, it has bugs, it doesn't handle trade context errors at all! Did I say it will lose you money? Comments about the trades it takes are welcome, especially if you have any ideas about what it could have done to improve/avoid any problems. (Pictures are good at this point). Note that we're following the Inside Bar trading method, so any suggestions need to work with this. I have absolutely no intention of selling this so any help you give helps everyone. Ultimately, if it works, then great, I'm using it to make money trading, why would I sell it? - Actually, ask yourself this about any EA - If they work, why are they being sold at all? The author should be trading and making money, not needing to sell it! Whilst it's in development I'm keeping the source to myself. I may release it if I'm happy with it, or if I cannot develop it further.

Will the EA need a magic number in order to work on more than 1 currency at a time?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Good question. The EA uses a magic number internally and only handles orders on its own chart currency. So running on multiple currencies is fine. However, if you run it on two charts using the same currency, say you want to do 30M and 1H at the same time with the same currency, then they WILL interfere. So don't do it, it may cause an explosion in the quantum combobulator (and we don't want that).

Another suckered trade on EURJPY. 6 Wins on 8 Trades. Actually, this looks like it may have been avoided as it appears to have incorrectly taken spread into account. The High doesn't seem to hit the IB. I need to check this. I'll keep posting these trades on a one by one basis for today only, I'll summarise them daily from tomorrow onwards.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
hi 1ka, Why don't you check the value of the 89 MA as part of the decision to take a trade or not ? checking this value is simple. once you it, you place Buy/Sell PO according to it. further more, you can add a filter for eliminating trades too close to the 89 MA line. I have some basic coding skills, and can assist if needed. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks Dani, I'm currently at the stage of checking to see what effect physical things such as volume, IB size, TP point, etc. have on the profit/loss ratio. When I've got a feel for those, then I can start to try and identify losing trades via indicators. Things like SMA and RSI are very useful. I'll run some back tests at a later stage and see how they all work individually and together (might take a while :-) ) In the meantime, I'm running the EA with the optimal settings found so far to see if the forward testing matches back testing. Back testing in MetaTrader is always a bit suspect and there's nothing as accurate as forward testing. Also, it's a bit of fun! If you have anymore indicator ideas that have helped you in real trading then please post, it's all useful to me and everyone else here.

Having been suckered on the Long, it drops through and wins on the short :lol: 7 wins on 9 trades.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Eventually got something from this one. Lucky again I think. (actually I jumped the gun, 1/2 is still in, but BE means it won't lose) 8 from 10.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
So close, but lost. Trading manually I might have saved this, assuming I would have taken it. 8 from 11.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Missed this from earlier. Again, notice that the bar doesn't actually touch the IB. Sack the coder. 8 for 12 (not so clever now, eh?)

Here are the results of restricting trading when there is low volume. EURUSD 30M 001 Min. Vol., 145 trades, 126 wins (86%), £119.16 EURUSD 30M 200 Min. Vol., 116 trades, 104 wins (89%), £127.96 EURUSD 30M 400 Min. Vol., 087 trades, 082 wins (94%), £139.12 EURUSD 30M 600 Min. Vol., 037 trades, 036 wins (97%), £101.35 EURUSD 30M 800 Min. Vol., 010 trades, 010 wins (100%), £54.87 EURUSD 30M 1000 Min. Vol., 02 trades, 002 wins (100%), £13.88 Wow, that is a clear correlation. Mind you, this was for the month of December, where trading was slack over Christmas. This needs some further testing over a longer period of time. Would restricting trading at low volume have stopped taking the recent losing trades in the forward testing? Lets see: USDCHF, no. Volume was still high so would have lost. EURCHF, no. ditto. EURJPY, no. ditto. USDCAD, no. ditto. So, looks good over December but not for today. I'll run the long term test, but am not expecting such a clear cut result.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Interesting...

--- 帖子 #65 ---
So, repeating the test over 2008 we get: EURUSD 30M 001 Min. Vol., 783 trades, 658 wins (84%), £57.19 EURUSD 30M 200 Min. Vol., 584 trades, 502 wins (85%), £85.44 EURUSD 30M 400 Min. Vol., 336 trades, 292 wins (86%), £85.22 EURUSD 30M 600 Min. Vol., 184 trades, 160 wins (86%), £39.64 EURUSD 30M 800 Min. Vol., 084 trades, 068 wins (81%), -£62.01 EURUSD 30M 1000 Min. Vol., 34 trades, 026 wins (100%), -£39.51 Ahh, no magic bullet for volume then as expected. The discrepancy in percentage wins is probably just the Christmas ones skewing the figures. Still, it may be worth setting a min. volume of 400 for EURUSD just to catch any similar Holiday action.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Are you using any indicators to choose the trend direction?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Having tested Volume and noticed the exaggerated Xmas Holiday effect when in December, I thought I'd better retest IB size over the whole year. The result was the same, a steadily declining win rate as we lower the max IB size we trade at, but from 84% to 79%.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi DramaKing, at this point I'm not even looking at trend! It takes the first break regardless of any other thing. The theory is that once we've checked that the physical things have no real effect on the IB win ratio, then we can only improve! I'm happy with a starting point of 80+% If it was below 50, I'd have walked by now :-)

--- 帖子 #69 ---
True true... keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Another win on this pair. It's trending well, we missed out on 40 pips between this trade and the previous one we had. A better way of following trends, or a better exit strategy might have kept us in for the missing pips, and the ones that will follow this, as it's still going strong. Still, the EA can only do so much. 9 wins from 13 (70%)

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks for posting this EA--I've been trying it out but get continued "invalid trade volume" errors in testing. Watching the log it says it sees live IB's but yet nothign happens. Do I have something set up wrong or what?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
You may need to change the lot size. It uses a micro lot size of 0.02 by default. Some brokers do not accept lot sizes less than a mini lot (0.1). When you load the EA you, change the lot size to 0.2 and try it again. Other than that, I'm not sure what it could be Note that the lot size needs to be divisible by 2, as it tries to close half part way through.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
can you try using another ea like swiss_army_ea to manage all trades ,minimum ts controlling both profit &amp; loss trades ( default) or only after profit to true with breakeven to 1 ? so that every trade be positive if your ea takes any good trade.also consider pairs with minimum spread . fontu

--- 帖子 #74 ---
###Auto Pivot.ex4 guys download it, it will update your daily pivot/r1/s1 etc everyday

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi fontu, I haven't heard of that EA, but maybe it'll avoid me needing to write that side of things. I'll have a look when I get time. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi, Just remember you can have a single EA running. You will have to combine the code in your EA. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
yes , add ts with breakeven should work &amp; if can ts less than 10 pips should be better &amp; without broker to know will be much better ( not got one such working silently) fontu

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Dani, you are correct. I'm hoping that the Swiss Army Knife EA can sit on it's own chart and manage all trades, since it can see them all. Although the idea of ripping out the bits I need means I have more control over things in the EA - decisions, decisions

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I've been trialling a trailing stop that works just like that. As soon as it hits 1/2 ATR it sets the SL to BE and then starts a trailing stop and keeps pushing the TP out. This has some scope but I need to test and work on the optimum values. In testing though, many trades hit the SL at BE before trending. Another thing to look at

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Anyway ts function is no of matter now as can be treated with swiss army, proper placement of the trades are more important. Hope this present EA do that timely. But so far no trades open by IB trader EA on my char on eurusd . manually I placed 3 pairs of pending orders 4 minutes back in gbpchf,gbpjpy &amp; eurusd having ts only 17 breateven at 1,breakslide 1 for both profit -loss trades . all come positive eu 28pips tp,gc sl +4 &amp; gj 30pips . manually close may have more pips.They take total 16 minutes &amp; SA worked properly securing the minimum profit . I think as we are using only pa breaks no need to have more sl to room for the movement,it should move oneway or close with minimum loss. sorry just now I see one instant order (sell) is placed in eursd By IBtrader &amp; by 1 sec closed with 25 pips loss by by my ea perhaps .If the IBtrader EA place 1 instant order instead of pending ones ? next bar I just place orders in eurusd to see what happen.It close with 9pips .

--- 帖子 #81 ---
One thing I just admit that I follow DIBs method of using insider bar &amp; only for 2 days now &amp; now I see here 1KA point to differnt methods " Inside Bar Trading ( THE MACHINE ) " using IB &amp; so there are differences . Don't know if they are much difference . fontu

CROESUS here is the other patterns I like to trade

--- 帖子 #84 ---
thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #85 ---
here is the euro s/r line i drew in I was just talking about in the room

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yes, the EA places instant orders when the IB breaks.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Not posting a summary of EA trades today - just realised that a tweak I made stopped it trading as frequently :-)

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Sometimes when an IB forms it may consolidate for a long time before an break out occurs. Does taking the break later affect the win ratio? Lets see: EURUSD 30M 3 bars 1225 trades, 1005 wins (82%) EURUSD 30M 4 bars 1541 trades, 1272 wins (83%) EURUSD 30M 5 bars 1674 trades, 1390 wins (83%) EURUSD 30M 6 bars 1714 trades, 1425 wins (83%) EURUSD 30M 7 bars 1738 trades, 1447 wins (83%) EURUSD 30M 8 bars 1742 trades, 1451 wins (83%) EURUSD 30M 9 bars 1752 trades, 1459 wins (83%) EURUSD 30M 10 bars 1758 trades, 1465 wins (83%) EURUSD 30M 15 bars 1762 trades, 1467 wins (83%) It's hard to see the effect, as the number of new trades taken by extending the bar is small compared to the number of overall trades. Lets take the difference between the previous bars results and the new one: EURUSD 30M 3 bars 1225 trades, 1005 wins (82%) EURUSD 30M 4 bars 316 new trades, 267 new wins (84.5%) EURUSD 30M 5 bars 133 new trades, 118 new wins (88.7%) EURUSD 30M 6 bars 40 new trades, 35 new wins (87.5%) EURUSD 30M 7 bars 24 new trades, 22 wins (91.7%) EURUSD 30M 8 bars 4 new trades, 4 new wins (100%) EURUSD 30M 9 bars 10 new trades, 8 new wins (80%) EURUSD 30M 10 bars 6 new trades, 6 new wins (100%) EURUSD 30M 15 bars 4 new trades, 2 new wins (50%) Hmm, nothing really conclusive as the samples are too small but it appears that going out a few bars more than I am (at 4) won't do any harm but will catch most of the 'missed' trades. Note that bar 1 is the enclosing bar and bar 2 is the trigger bar. Bar 3 is the first bar that can actually break out. Maybe I should change the EA so this is bar 1, as that would be logical, captain.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Everything sounds great on this, 1ka, but something is wrong here. I have yet to have it do anything at all. It sees the IB and it's logged but it never takes a trade. I have other EAs working just fine so I'm at a loss. Is it possible that the EA needs to work alone? I have other EAs on EUR working together without problem but it's the only thing I can think of. I tried your idea of moving the lot size up to 0.2 but still nothing. Anything you can come up with would be appreciated--I love the IB trade so I'm hoping I can make this thing work. Thanks.

Hello, I am Ranger in the chat room that thinkpip started along with 1KA(here on FF) or ONEKA in the chatroom. I have been trading since 97, started with equities and then options, next up futures. For the past several years scalping the eminis as well as currency futures. I like them but I think FX has a lot more to offer. I like being able to trade anytime of day and it be liquid. I know a lot of people tell you the cme futures for currencies are the way to go but I think they are definately not. For those of you in the UK during your normal time to trade there is no liquidity in the cme currencies but in fx there are. Also fx gives you a lot more pairs to trade. I dont believe in brokers stop hunting personal accounts, big players stop hunt in logical places just as they do in the eminis. This gives us the opportunity to fade these moves, but I dont think fx brokers do this on a personal account level. Atleast I have never had this problem. I trade with gft and chart thru tradestation. Now for years bascially since 97 I have been a scalper and it is a lot tougher in the fx market. I used to scalp bigger size for pennies or ticks all day long. Now thats harder to do in fx. But my personality for trading is still not very patient. But I do what is necessary to make money and make a living. So I have been sucessful at trading the Inside bars. I have been trading them for a while. While I dont have a lot of strict rules on them in my next post I will explain more. Since some pairs have a distinctive personality and range I trade accordingly to the pair as long as I am familiar with it. I trade these of the 15 min chart which creates lots of oppurtunities throughout the day. Yes since it is a shorter time frame it will have more false breakouts, but thats where we come in as traders using the price action and s/r to determine where we think it is headed and if it is viable. I also trade these same inside bars on the 30/60/240 min. While they offer bigger profit potential they also have bigger stop losses as well But if you are willing to take the stop loss risk you will see as the time frame goes higher the probabilities of the inside bars working are greater. Personally speaking my fav timeframe is the 15 min for inside bars but I do 30 mins alot as well and try to hit all the viable ones. I also scalp off a 5 min chart to kinda feed my addiction to the scalping side when I am waiting for an inside bar to set up. Along with inside bars on the time frames I mention I also use a shooting star patter which has done very well. Again the higher the tf the better our chances. I will take these on the 15 min but these I really like on the 30/60/240 min. So those are the ways I trade. We are in the room most of the day discussing the ways we trade and we are open to any ideas anyone has. No matter how long we have been trading we are traders and we are adaptable and leave our egos at the door, if we dont the markets will humble us. So we are all willing to take advice and willing to learn from one another. I dont care if someone has been trading 10 years or 10 days if they say something or show something that looks good I will take a look and see if it could work for me. We are always learning..... My next post will go over how I trade the IBS maybe a little different than some and I tend to be a little more aggressive in some instances. So please bear with me. On to the next post that will be coming in a few....

--- 帖子 #91 ---
As for my inside bars on the 15/30/60/240 timeframes. I wait for them to set up as does anyone else. I usually draw my own s/r lines of swing points that the market is bouncing above and below over the past day or so. Also will draw trendlines from the past day and keep them up on the screen. I have a 20/50 period ema up so generally when the price is below I look for shorts , above I look for longs. As the price gets farther away from the emas, I might play some that are countertrend. But generally stay with the trend. The one thing I do differently then some is when the inside bar forms inside the previous bar. For example lets say its going to be short. So now we are waiting for the current bar to trigger our sell. I will usually sell as soon as the current bar breaks the body of the inside bar not the wick. To me its a point where the inside bar couldnt hold the low of the bar, so as soon as out current trigger bar hits below the body I short. Some might not like this but this is the way I do it and do not push it on anyone. It affords me a tighter stoploss. As soon as the the market moves in my direction 5-10 pips I will bring my stop loss down by that much. As it goes lower I keep bringing my stop loss with it. I dont like heat as no one does but I also dont want to waste my time in a trade going against me for 2 hours and not stopping me out and then going my way. I will come back for it later. I would rather the trade work right away or get out quick with a very small loss and most times b/e and then come back when it is ready to make its move. So I am very aggressive moving my stop loss down with the trade, and very very rarely do I get stopped out using the initial stop loss on the trade becuase it is bascially only there in the beginging and then it is moved down. The only indicator I use is stochs. I try to get in the trade with the trend when it is over bot and over sold, and as we know a real strong trend will not read good on the stochs so then I disregard it, if it is a ranging day then true stoch readings will be fine. But its just a guide to try and put the probabilities on my side. I base my trades on pure price action. Here is a pic of a 15 min chart with 2 ibs( they have yellow dots on them from my tradestation indicator) The white line is where I shorted. They are also both below the emas for me, so I went ahead with them. The next post will be about the star patterns

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I showed this chart on this thread today for someone in the room as I was explaining what I do. Like I said I look for shooting star patterns. First I like a nice trend , in this case we are looking at the gbpusd. I like the 30 min charts for these as well. So when a pair in this example is trending down, and then seems to reverse a little and go up. Instead of me trying to time the bottom and buy . I let it run its course up and let the trade come to me I want to see the exhaustion and as well as not breaking the downtrend. I want to see a nice blow out shooting star and then thats my trigger to look to short. It doesnt matter to me what the color of the star is. Once I see the actual shooting star, lets say its green well then the next bar will start higher above the star as it comes back down and if it comes back down, I short as soon as it also breaks the body of the star. Again I am aggresive with my stoploss bringing it in quickly. If it is a red shooting star then generally the next bar starts even at the low of the body of the star at this point I wait for it to break the wick to short, still with tight stops. If it doesnt work quick I am out and look for another single maybe another star or IB . So you might take a small loss here or there as long as you are smart about the money management but when these run they run usually pretty well and quick. Here is a pic below of a red star and a green star in the pound/dollar. The next post will just be about my scalping off the 5 min to bide my time waiting for the bigger setups

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Sorry this pic goes with the last post about the shooting star

--- 帖子 #94 ---
So on the 5 min chart I also put up a 20 and 50 period ema. When we are below I look for shorts on retracements to the emas and when we are above the emas I look to go long on retracements down to the emas. My triggers to go short and long are still IBS and stars same rules apply. I just look for a quick 10-20 pips on these scalps. See attached picture. You can see the yellow dot is the inside bar , the ellipse is where I liked the trade that came back to the emas on a short day. So thats bascially pretty simple. Here is the pic

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Well thats generally how I trade. Mostly like I said IB'S and clear star patterns and the 5 min for scalping as I am scanning for our setups. I like to keep it as simple as possible not have a million rules. Rules are good, but the rules that are best for me are simple its money management , money management, and money management. I am confidnet enough in having enough oppurtunities present itself during the day. But if I do take the wrong one I want to make sure I am not throwing a whole day away on one trade or trying to make it back. So I keep things tight and go from there adn trade what I see and what the market gives me. By the way I am in the US so sometimes I wont make it to the room as early as the UK guys but I am trying to get up earlier and earlier Have a great night all and see you guys soon in the room. Ranger

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Ranger thx for sharing your trading style. Very interesting. todd

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Thanks Ranger, there's something for everyone in those posts! The idea of trailing the SL early on the IBs is a good idea. I'll tweak the EA to use a simple version of that and see what the effect is. My gut feel is that the win-ratio will drop, but that we'll start to see more profit. Currently we're at 80+% with BE on profit at best. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Great posts, Ranger! ... following this thread as well ... Fox

--- 帖子 #99 ---
jcbwrites, hmm, tricky one. The EA should work OK with other things, but I haven't tried it so maybe there is an incompatibility. I guess you are using the second EA I posted (need to start using version numbers). This has the defaults set at optimum and is 'better' than the first one. The EA does write some verbose messages to the log file. Depending where you installed metatrader the logs are in the experts\logs directory. Mine are here -&gt; C:\Program Files\MetaTrader\experts\logs If you post the log in the forum then I can look at it. Note, the log file will have everything in it including all your trades. If you post it here, run it through 'grep' to only get the log entries with IBTrader in them. If you can't do this, then post it to my email address, I've PM'd you with it , and I'll treat it in the utmost confidence. === Well I would PM you but you have PM turned off! Either PM me or if you can do the grep thing then post here, thanks.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I will show pics once in a while of clear stars or IBs I like just so you get used to the patterns if your new Good trading day to all , becareful of ECB conference today. Here is a pic of a star on the euro this morning

--- 帖子 #101 ---
The pure IB trading method suggests that SL is moved to the BE point after taking 1/2 profit at 1/2 ATR. Up until now, the EA has been moving the SL to the opening price at this point. Does giving the price more room to move improve the chances of catching the trend again after a small reversal? Well the figures are as follows: EURUSD 15M, ZERO SL, 3001 trades, 2522 wins (84%), -£460.96 EURUSD 15M, BE SL, 2962 trades, 1315 wins (70%), -£451.00 EURUSD 30M, ZERO SL, 1765 trades, 1500 wins (85%), £9.51 EURUSD 30M, BE SL, 1706 trades, 1224 wins (72%), -£4.63 EURUSD 1H, ZERO SL, 929 trades, 766 wins (82%), -£178.71 EURUSD 1H, BE SL, 904 trades, 639 wins (71%), -£181.30 As expected the win ratio drops, as we're now setting a SL at the BE point for the trade as a whole, rather than the zero point for the second half of the trade. What we don't see is any major change in profit, so we could assume that there are as many trades that carry on to hit the TP as do hit the SL. As with all the analysis so far we need to revisit them once we've started to use indicators and, hopefully, isolated the majority of losing trades.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Well--many thanks for the help, 1ka. Attached is the log file for yesterday. I left in the H1H1_IB indicator lines along with the IBTrader lines to show the correlation--they are both seeing the IBs. One thing I have noticed is a lot of initialize/deinitialize going on--I have been fiddling trying to get it to work so I'm hoping that's the only reason for all those. BTW--I have between 3 and 5 other EAs running simultaneously with the IBTrader. I have looked for any possible interaction but have yet to see any logged anywhere--maybe I'm missing something there. Today I'll try setting up a completely separate demo account and run only IBTrader in it. That may also tell me something. My hours are a bit off from the regular forum so I may be a bit slow getting back and forth--plus I'm traveling tomorrow (Friday). I'll check into the forum over the weekend if you discover anything earthshaking! Once again, many thanks for the help--I'd love to see this thing in action!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi jcbwrites I was looking at your log and see that your "maxbars" is set to 4 and your baroffset is set to 30. I dont no which broker you use, but if they dont use fractional pips your baroffset setting is set quite high. I had the same problem as you with no trades being opened. I changed my baroffset to 3 and increased my maxbars setting and the EA seems to be working good now for me. Not sure if that is your problem, but thought I would add my 2 cents worth. Hope that helps Ray

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hey--thanks Sparky--have no idea what any of these inputs do so I just took them as they were set in the EA--I'll give it a try

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Er, &lt;has quick look at code&gt; MaxBars is the number of bars the EA will 'go-back' to find an IB. Since the count starts from the actual bar that started the IB (the leftmost bar) then it needs to be at least 3 before anything will work (and yes, I need to change this so it starts from 1 and not 3 :-) ). Six is a good figure as it allows up to four bars to be considered for the breakout. BarOffset is the number of pips that are added to the high and low of the IB. The breakout and subsequent order will only happen when the price crosses this value. If you are on a 4-digit account, you should change this to 3. I suspect this is the problem you can see. Good spot by Sparky, thanks. ==== Just checked your log and this is indeed the problem. Your point is 0.0001 rather than my brokers which is 0.00001. 06:04:33 IBTrader EURUSD,M30: IBTrader has been initialised. Point is 0.00010000, Spread is 2, Stop Level is 3

Thanks 1ka for the update EA doing .during 2nd half means pa already in a trend &amp; hence there should be good room for the movements &amp; finding proper sl pair specific is not any good job.After over 1 years of trading still I am very unsuccessfull in using trading with correct sl &amp; hence to take more risk. anyway what I am doing from the day I look into the insider bar from dibs thread are : just trying to recognise one IB 1. Probable IB: As new current bar forming &amp; within the ranges previous bar (obviously is greater than new) though should not be correct one as still to close it &amp; by this time it may not be any IB .Such forms can be meet any time frames &amp; almost every few minutes.Just place 1 buy stop above 3pips +spread and one sell stop below 3pips +spread from the high &amp; low values of the previous bar &amp; not sl. Once triggered any after some profit set sl very close to the price order &gt;1pips above /below to confirm the profit or I activate swiss_army EA to do that&gt; when certain profit usually I close it or keep on ts and or tp.Intween If the price go back the triggered price I simply close it .The other pending order also delete after one triggered .so free trade without any or minimum risk.So far used in M5 to m30 tfs, anytime &amp; all with profit .here only scalping for minimum profit 100% sitting before computer&amp; acting fast without much lust for profit &amp; no follow up of the trade as they may be much profitable. 2.Pure IB : After one good size bar there are 1 or multiple insider bars then also do as above &amp; in that case open pending orders in relation to the previous good size bar and usually for the trades for bigger profit . So far this works very good. Just for exchange of views trading insider bar. fontu

For those folks who are trying this out, then here is the latest EA. Nothing much has changed except I've tweaked trend trailing and turned it on by default. Note that when a trend is moving it will set the SL to 'chase' the trend and push the TP out. The idea is that as long as it's trending it will continue onwards until it reverses and hits the SL. This will result in many OrderModify calls and I'm not sure how brokers respond to that (do they care?). A potential side effect, and I'm guessing about this, is that if the MetaTrader client only allows a single request to be in action at any one time then these calls may fail, as will any other requests, such as closing an order. I suspect these calls are queued and actioned in order, so it may be OK. I need to read up on this and see what the effects are. ========== Oh, and DON'T use this on a live account. It WILL lose you money

--- 帖子 #108 ---
unless u used SL = TP, otherwise, your 80% win ratio is not meaningful when you consider multiple time frame. in other words, 4h's 80% win is very different from 80% win in 30m, in terms of both price action and number of pips. just my 1 cent. p.s. therefore, i think the longer TF, the more significant the IB is (more likely to win.....)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Thanks fontu, it's good to read how other people are trading with IBs.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thank you for all your hard work and willingness to share. I am running this EA on a demo account at the moment, but it has only been for a couple days. I will share my results with you when I have a few more days of history.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Every cent is welcome 99,999,999 more and I'll be a $ millionaire The TP values are based around the average bar size, so will be relative to the timeframe they are on. They will naturally be larger on the higher timeframes, as will the SL. Even so, the EA does not show any major change in the win ratio at higher timeframes. What I do expect to change is that when we start to use trending indicators these will be more accurate at higher timeframes so result in less losing trades and increasing the win ratio.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
There have been posts in the forum and the chat room about using the RSI indicator to improve the win ratio or the profit taken. The idea is that if the RSI is above 50 then we only Buy and if it's below 50 we Sell. I ran a number of tests with RSI periods of 8, 13, 18 &amp; 23. I also looked at introducing bands 60/40 and 70/30 rather than just 50/50. To me the results are inconclusive. I can see some subtle changes in win ratios and some changes in profit/loss. However, I can't see an overriding trend that would suggest the RSI indicator is weeding out only bad trades. Attached are some grabs to show the results.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Have you ever tried to use TP of 1/2 size of outside bar? for example, the set-up has 2 bars, 1 inside bar (the later bar), the other is the "outside bar" (the earlier bar). if the outside bar is 50 pips high (High()-Low()), then use 50*1/2 = 25 pips as the TP. the reason behind is that often big IB bar breakout is led by a long "outside bar" movement that's often followed by a big retrace or further big move.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi charvo, I hear what you are saying and it might be worth explicitly trying that at some point although I think the results will be similar to the ATR we use. With the ATR we're averaging the height (High-Low) of the last 20 bars. I ran a test a while back that showed initial TP at 0.5 ATR was better than initial TP at full ATR (better meaning a higher win ratio). The pure IB thread has followed suit and also recommends 0.5 ATR. All this means though is that an average breakout continues for half a bar before retracement to the SL. Thanks and keep the ideas coming.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
26 wins from 31 trades across various currencies (84%). I'd like to post the results but can't attach HTML. If people are interested I could zip them but this not as convenient. Actually, when we take 1/2 profit the trade splits and is counted as two trades. This is in keeping with the strategy tester which reports trades the same way. Whilst it looks like it is inflating the win ratio, it's probably the right thing to do as the second trade could fail (although we have set a SL to avoid this). We ran some tests recently where the SL was at the trade BE and saw some of the second half trades report a loss and lower the win ratio.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
1ka--finally got the IBTrader working on usdchf but only one trade so far. I changed the maxbars to 5 and the baroffset to 3 at the suggestion of one other user. Still not working on the eurusd. I'll try this one and see what happens next week. Thanks for all your hard work--this has a lot of potential.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Here are the results for this whole day by the default settings, (previous version).

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Can you please post your results and currencies

--- 帖子 #119 ---
As requested. Take these with a pinch of salt, as the saying goes. A bug meant that some trades were not getting closed after setting the SL to zero BE. This was fixed in the afternoon. Trend trailing was switched on in the evening.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
It does, but only if we can weed out those losing trades. They lose big time (in comparison) and wipe out the profit. If anyone can find a consistent method that identifies these bad trades, without affecting the good ones too much, then post here. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Nice anto, any suggestions on how to get rid of those losing trades would be welcome.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Some times Sell/or buy is taken when the price is bouncing on the orderlines(boundaries). In this casee, the price pierces through boundry in the opposite side. So, If we EA can some identify the boundries that that would be great. Hope, I will make this more clearer this evening.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Folks, We now have the basics for an EA that trades using the IB method. To extend this EA further it needs to be 'clever' enough to take trades that have a higher probability of winning. We humans do this by using indicators, trends and 'feel'. I think it is possible for me to write a generic interface to the EA whereby any budding programmers out there could plug in their own routine to increase the win ratio. All it requires is that the routine returns true if the trade is valid, false if not. If required, parameters would be passed as a String, it would be up to the programmer to parse the String and extract any values they require. This String would be set as one of the EA parameters at run-time. Is anyone interested in this? You wouldn't need to release your code, but you could post the compiled exe for others to use if you think it's a winner. Post to the forum and let me know what you think.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I think the win ratios are fantastic,I feel its up to the trader to get as much out of a trade as he can,every trade is different and you have to be able to see what is happening price wise.An EA I feel can't do this,and I always trade manually on live account. Also if it is in a strong trend don't close out all your position leave say 25% on and let it run,you won't get that many,but the ones that go can make you thousands of pips,also have you tried only entering trades when the entry bar is the same colour as the trigger bar?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I haven't, that's another one for the list of things to try, thanks.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
We're at the stage where we are trying to weed out the losing trades. One of the pure IB methods is to use Trend Of the Moment. When trading we are mindful that we only follow the current trend. In the EA I've coded TOM as the gradient of the last x bars based upon average of High/Low. Running this through the EA gives the results attached. Nothing really stands out here, we're reducing the trades but not really increasing the win ratio by that much. NEXT!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Repeating the above, but this time calculating the average using Open/Close gives the attached results. These are better with lower numbers of bars, but again, nothing spectacular. ONWARDS!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Another aspect of the pure IB trading technique is to be mindful of the overall trend, as well as TOM. So, if we calculate the overall trend from the Daily Bars in a similar manner to TOM, we get the results as attached. There is a consistent positive profit as we increase the number of bars, without much change in the win ratio. Hmm, interesting. A better way of calculating the daily trend could be needed. I hear Moving Averages calling...

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Everyone knows that you don't trade on a single indicator, right? Even a noob like me knows that. And I'm a real noob. The noobiest of noobs ;-) So what if we mix the TOM, Trend and RSI indicators that we've used up to now? Look below. Our number of trades decrease, but we kind of expected that. We also get a significant rise in the win ratio, 92% anyone? And on that note I shall retrieve those beers from the fridge that have been chilling for the past few hours. Bottoms Up!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I DIDNT GET IT :{ THISE IS 1\1 RISK\REWORD WHAT U PRESENTING HERE ON THE DATA?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
HI 1ka, Normally buy or sell orders are placed 10pips+spread away from the inside bar on daily charts; correct me if I am wrong. However, the EA places order juat at the high or low of the previous bar. For example, the attached EU would have been 2 winners with out trouble, if the orders were taken based on this method. If we look back on previous big looser, they were all taken based on previous long bars, and the price could not really pierce through much higher than that.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Im very interested in this oneka. I have a fair bit of programming experience and would enjoy taking your framework and trying out some ideas with it - I have a few in mind already. So count me in

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I am going to download mt4 this weekend and try and get up to speed with this, not the programming part but looking at how this ea works , I have to learn to install them first. Then maybe I can have some ideas to throw around and you guys, thinkpip and 1ka can help me out! Thanks for the pm 1ka I am spending the weekend getting to know mt4~

--- 帖子 #134 ---
You all spotted the flaw with this, right? Yep, to get that 92% figure we're only trading 6% of the possible trades. We've thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We should be able to get this win ratio without cutting so many trades.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Anto, Thanks for your explanation. You are not wrong, just working in a different way I think your method of starting the breakout 10 pips away from the inside bar works well at the higher timescales, such as daily one you use. At the lower timescales there can be much movement within the IB before it breaks out of the outer bounds. If we use the inner bar to determine the breakout it may lead to many false trades at the lower timescales. However, it's worth thinking about and I'll add it to the long list of stuff to try.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I'm not sure what part you don't get, so let me run through the workings. All testing is done on EURUSD 30M for the whole of 2008 unless otherwise stated. The first result is for the IB method without using any 'indicators' to reduce false trades. This is the reference trade and shows the theoretical maximum number of trades (1767). From this the IB has 'won' 1500 trades. Note that the EA splits the trade at 1/2 ATR and lets the other 1/2 run. The strategy tester counts this as two trades as, in theory at least, the second 1/2 could result in a loss. It doesn't since we've moved the SL to the open price so the worst that could happen is we close with zero profit. (As a quick aside, the 1500 winning trades originated as 750 trades. 267 trades still lost so the 'real' win ratio is 73.7%, not 84.89% - but who am I to argue with MetaTrader ) In previous posts we've been looking at the effects individual indicators such as RSI, TOM and Trend have on the EA. The goal is to reduce the number of losing trades. Individually, these trades have not had much effect as far as I can see (without doing some major statistical analysis and running the EA a few hundred times with a variety of input parameters). So the post you commented on has tried to use the indicators together. The first column shows the TOM indicator and the number of bars it used. The second is the Trend indicator and the number of bars it used. The third is the RSA indicator and the levels it used. See the previous posts for further details of these. An xxxx means the indicator was not used. Looking at the results again the second result shows that we are using the TOM indicator with 5 bars and the Trend indicator with 15 bars. We didn't use the RSI indicator and we took 695 trades of the possible 1767. 604 of these won. The remaining results are the same, just different combinations of indicators. The number of bars used in the indicators were chosen as the 'best' values from the individual analysis. This test wasn't exhaustive by any means, three variables having three or more possible parameters gives a huge number of tests to do to show all combinations. It was Friday, I did a selection We haven't changed the risk/reward. We still have an average profit of ~1.5 and an average loss of ~7.5 It's just that we have reduced the number of losing trades so start to see a more consistent profit. Hopefully that answers your question, if not ask again

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Well, you asked for it (or at least thinkpip did ) There is a generic interface that allows you to write your own code that will help the EA decide whether a trade is valid or not. To get started: Put the attached IBTrader EA in the experts directory of your MetaTrader installation. Put both IBTrader-Ind files in the experts\libraries directory of your MetaTrader installation. Restart MetaTrader and you're off. To create your own indicators you will need to edit the IBTrader-Ind.mq4 file and add your own logic. An example RSI indicator is included. If your indicator needs parameters then you can pass them into the indicator through the EA string property ExtIndParams . You will, of course, need to parse the string if you have multiple parameters. Make sure that the EA property UseExternalInd is set to true otherwise your new routine will not be called. And that's it. Any questions then just ask in the forum. I still need to think about how we do Debug, but for now just call Print as per usual. If you identify any useful indicators, then let us know. We'd be interested to see what you've got.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
1ka, I respectfully suggest a Maximum Adverse Excursion study of all winning trades from your original test (in which all breaks of IBs were taken regardless of TOM,Trend, indicators,etc.). This is an effort to determine the point at which a trade is highly unlikely to become a winner once it has moved against us. At this point we set our stops, rather than at the opp end of the IB. A percentage of ATR might be a try, or perhaps a percentage of the length of the IB. Pippo

I shall take a look at this also, thanks.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
***Lurking mode OFF*** LOL! Hi 1ka Thank you for all your efforts on this. I'm sorry that I haven't been able to contribute till now but I've been away for a week (and have to go away again in a week's time). I have been trialing your system on demo on my laptop but keep having to log off between hotel and office. I have now installed your latest version on demo accounts my home computer which runs 24/7. Below are my thoughts, based on what I'm doing on my live account: Personally, I think that you should stick to the simple premis that you started off with, without any filters. These are my observations: 99% of breakouts of IB's will hit 100% extension (2.0 and -1.0 on the MT4 fib tool) Edit your MT4 fib tool to show 0, 1.0, 2.0 and -1.0 levels and then try it on EURUSD. Bloody awesome! (Of course, there are cr@p days like 15 Jan). 50% of breakouts of IB's will hit 350% extension (4.5 and -3.5). 99% of the first M30 IB of an Alpari Day will hit 350% extension (though sometimes via the scenic route!). Works on any pair. Works on M30, H1 and Daily. I think that it's worth testing your EA to just trade the breakout of the IB (not the previous OB, which it does at the moment). If you put that on, say, eight pairs, you will always have a couple of trades running so you won't get bored! Just my 2p. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
(Converts to cents, adds to total and now has roughly 4 cents, yay!) If two people suggest the same thing in the space of a day then there must be something in it. Enough already, I'll test breaking out at the inner bar and not the outer bar. Quick question though, for you or anto , do you include the inners bars candlestick shadow or just the body when determining the breakout? I shall also look into your fib suggestion in conjunction with this, though Pippo's MAE needs looking at first to evaluate the best place to stick an SL. Won't be this weekend though, much too busy.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I, through preference, use OHLC bars rather than candles. I use breakout of High and Low. Long Stop Entry: High + 3 pips + spread. SL is Low minus 3 pips. TP is 100% of IB range. Short Stop Entry: Low minus 3 pips. SL is High + 3 pips +spread. TP is 100% of IB range. All the best.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Yes, I agree. I use same settings. ..... Food for thought: From PeterCrown's post"Win rate is not the most important factor in finding a good trading method. Profit potential/risk is. "

--- 帖子 #146 ---
OK, I lied, I did have 5 minutes to make the change so that it would use the inner bar to begin breakout and set SL. I haven't changed TP, it still uses the 1/2 ATR as the first TP. So, on EURUSD 30M for 2008 we get: Using IB 1762 trades, 1467 wins (83.3%), profit -7.69, Avg Profit 1.37, Avg Loss -6.83 Using OB 2236 trades, 1711 wins (76.5%), profit -40.03, Avg Profit 1.36, Avg Loss -4.52 Well, we can't make any judgements based upon one timeframe and one currency, so I'll leave that until I get some time to test. If anyone wants to try it, I've attached another version of the EA. Change the parameter UseIBForBreakout to true if you want to test using the inner bar rather than the traditional outer bar. Cheers. p.s. It was a quick change, so might be buggy Actually, the fact it has 27% more trades suggests that it's breaking out multiple times for each IB. Let me see if I can fix that. Hmm, tried an obvious fix and it did reduce the number of trades, we now have 10% more which seems reasonable as we are more likely to break out with a smaller range. New figures and updated EA below: Using IB 1762 trades, 1467 wins (83.3%), profit -7.69, Avg Profit 1.37, Avg Loss -6.83 Using OB 1942 trades, 1480 wins (76.2%), profit -55.98, Avg Profit 1.38, Avg Loss -4.53

Results for Friday. I was robbed of 13.87. Having stopped the EA it couldn't close 1/2 at 1/2 ATR and never reached TP

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Maybe I should try H1 - Was this using a breakout at the outer range of the IB, or the inner range of the IB (as per the discussion in the previous few posts)? Thanks. p.s. I see you posted a non-standard chart in Jim's 'pure' IB thread - prepare for some abuse You can post what you like in this thread

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thanks for the revised EA! I've installed on my three demo platforms - Daily, H1 and M30. Each platform has these eight pairs: EURUSD GBPUSD EURJPY GBPJPY EURCHF GBPCHF EURGBP USDJPY By using separate platforms for different time frames, my pea-sized brain doesn't get confused by all the order lines across the charts and I know which order relates to which time frame. Well done 1ka! I'll see how I get on.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Whilst I think your set up is OK, just be wary of running the EA in the same MetaTrader instance using multi-timeframes on the same currency . It might be a problem for you if you are using the same Demo account across the three platforms. To be safe, make sure they are unique. The EA checks its magic number for orders against currency, but doesn't include timeframe. If you were to run on EURUSD at 30M and 1H in the same metatrader instance then you would get problems if both ordered. They'd start to get confused about which order was theirs with the possible result that nothing gets modified or closed. I'll think about a fix for this, there are some easy ones, but maybe not any that can cope with a user ordering on one timeframe and changing to another. Time to ponder... === Easiest fix - let the user override the Magic No!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Yes, I agree. I have three unique account numbers, for the three time frame platforms, all in separate folders in C:\Program Files. Actually, I also have another demo account for mucking about and my live account. I have five Alpari accounts running 24/7. LOL! Edit: Good point. When I move the EA to my live account, there will be conflicts with different time frames. Can you add the magic number to the variables? Sorry, I'm a humble engineer and not a programming wizard.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Quick change to the EA to expose the Magic Number as a parameter. You shouldn't need to worry about this unless you need to run the multiple EA's on the same currency, on different timeframes in the same account. In this case you just need to change the Magic Number to be something unique. Magic Numbers can be associated with specific trades. It allows an EA to distinguish between the trades it has placed and other trades.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
My previous post should read, "...opp end of set-up bar." Also, "...a percetage of the set-up bar." I was distracted.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Yes, it was something I was planning to do at some point (the list is getting longer and longer ) It might be worth back-testing the EA over a year and collating the results in a spreadsheet, as you've already done. The longer timeframe will average out any anomalies. Another factor could be day of the week, everyone says Fridays are bad trading days, so it'd be nice to see that. I will probably do this at some point. I already have a way of importing the trades into a database and reporting on various bits. However, if you beat me to it I won't complain

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Just realized I screwed up that spread sheet and what I said may not have been true. Will back test over longer period of time and experiment with days also.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Interesting thread people. I was wondering when someone would get around to making an EA for the IB system. Would some kind soul kindly post all current indicators necessary for latest EA to work in a single post, it is confusing looking for different bits all over the place. Thanks

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thanks! I'll let you know how I get on.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Rastaman, You only need the EA, it doesn't use indicators, per se. Pick up stuff from here -&gt; http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=137 . Drop the EA on any chart, any timeframe. It should 'just work'. We talk about using indicators, such as trend and RSI, but these are coded in the EA (and not in the one that's been released) Don't use it on a live account, it will lose you money

--- 帖子 #160 ---
You hit the nail on the head...I was thinking the indicators mentioned were necessary for teh EA to work. All is clear. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Following on from Pippo 's post about using Maximum Adverse Excursion then here is the analysis from EURUSD on M30 for 2008. Red dots are losing trades, blue dots are winners. The X-Axis shows the maximum profit the trend reached The Y-Axis shows the maximum loss the trend reached. The group of red dots along the X-Axis are, I think, the losing trades after we take 1/2 profit and reset the SL. It shows that there is a tendency for these trades to bounce back for a small loss. There does seem to be a distinct line between the winning trades and the losing ones. This is roughly 60~70 degrees from the horizontal. I now need to decide how I can code this trend line to automatically close a trade if it falls to the left of the line into the red zone. By doing this we will reduce our losses. I might redraw this graph using % of IB size and see if it's as clear cut.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Attached is the graph showing todays results. We were doing fine until the evening. Still 0.13 profit

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Good, it was also good fom 00 GMT upt12 GMT... after that the market was ranging.....I think i netted about 70 to 120 pips/ I do not post the results, because I got confused with other EAs also....So, got a new demo accounts. Looks to me, breakout IB true seems to be a looser than IB false.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
1ka, Looks like SL 25 with no B/E alteration may produce best results. Nice work. Pippo

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Yesterday for me, using IB Breakout True: I ran it on 0.5 lot, which is the sort of size I would probably use live. On EURUSD: minus £80 Overall, on the eight pairs I mentioned earlier: plus £1242. One thing: it doesn't seem to be allowing for spread on northbound trades, so it got me into trades without the IB being breached. Quite a lot of those eventually turned out to be profitable, as it happens. The TP on half and leave half thing is awesome! All the best

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks Anto, Sledgehammer I wonder if the Inner Bar Breakout ( UseIBForBreakout =true) is currency sensitive since Sledgehammer lost on EURUSD? Nice overall result though. For me, EURGBP was the big loser yesterday, lots of -5's and one -15. I'll have a look at the spread issue with buy trades, I think I've noticed this before. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hello 1Ka Thank you for all your work in writing this EA. I am still attempting to learn the language and I am unclear how to insert a "Custom Indicator" that I am using on my charts. Can I trouble you to give an MetaEditor example of how you would modify the IBTrader-Ind? (Say "FX Sniper's LSMA") Thanks, Kirl

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Fixing the SL to 25 gives the results as below (before/after). I need to look at this further as it doesn't quite give the increase in profit I was hoping for.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I haven't tried to incorporate and existing indicator into the EA, they've all been re-coded to fit in the EA. However, here is a snippet of code from another EA I've seen. It reads values directly from an external indicator, which is what you are looking for, I think. I have no idea what it does but it might point you in the right direction. if(iCustom(NULL,period,"ZigAndZag",4,Closebar)!=0){close=true;SetArrow(251,3,false,White);} if(iCustom(NULL,GrossPeriod,"ZigAndZag",5,ZZbar)!=0){buy=true;SetArrow(241,1,true,Blue);} if(iCustom(NULL,GrossPeriod,"ZigAndZag",6,ZZbar)!=0){sell=true;SetArrow(242,1,false,Red);}

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Thanks for the response 1ka I was attempting to use the iCustom function, but I was not succeeding in inserting the indicator. I will use your suggestion as an example. Thanks again, Kirl

--- 帖子 #171 ---
1ka, In the study of SL 25 what was TP?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Initially it is 1/2 ATR where I take half the lot. This seems to give a reasonable hit rate. Anything bigger and we get more losers. Could go smaller I suppose, maybe have a fixed value?

Hi Billbss, How are you Please see Currency trader magazine of this month pg 20 -pg 24 article titled "Inside day set ups" there the ib on daily charts has been tested with statistical data on several pairs for the period dec31 1998 - dec 31 2008 (this is 10 years period) for certain predicitive patterns with and without filters and has statitically found to be profitable and the result has been published. The trading method is much different from this thread but the basic pattern ie the IB on daily charts has been found to have an edge if traded in a certain way. I'm not saying this means they do definitively work but it certainly shows they do have an edge and a little predicitive power - they showed an inverted price action pattern, inside days that closed higher preceded short term down moves and vice versa (please just see the article for details) In addition to this I remember Peter Crowns discussion about his method of IB trading and he had clearly said he had 10 years worth data to back up his theory. In addition to this I personally know people who trade the IB using James's 40-100 pips a day method over at babypips have been profitable. Well at least they claim to be. why not have another look. thanks.

Thought I'd run a quick test to see what effect the ATR period has on the results. Images below are for ATR periods of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 &amp; 60. The EA has been running with an ATR of 20, but some of the higher ATRs seem to give subtly better results, at least on the long term EURUSD 30M. I suspect that we're averaging out the bars and getting rid of some extremes where the ATR is too large to hit the 1/2 ATR TP. A figure of 40 seems to be best. I'll post a new EA at the beginning of the thread (1st post).

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Attached is the graph showing todays results. Lots of ups and downs.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Examining the live trades on the EUR/USD the last several day it seems like most of the bad trades were made on small setup bars that were less than 50 pips. When I run a back test for last year the EA performed a lot better during the last quarter when volatility increased quite a bit. May be that we need a minimum setup bar size that would need to be adjusted manually once in awhile to compensate for this.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Today it was a scary day......Still the EA picked up 49 pounds in demo. Risk to Reward is also scary especially when you see the SL. Today, the winners in GU and EJ were picked up at the opposite ends....At one point the loss was around 60 compared to the profit (£10). If it were in live, i would have definitely in panic. So, we need to do something. Anto

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Anto, Abnormalone Thanks. Never thought about a minimum set up bar, always assumed the problem was with the big ones I'll post here with a new version if I get time to do this. I'm currently trying to see if the EA should bail out when a trade is open and a second IB forms. The idea is that I move the SL for the Outer IB to the new Inner IB. Anyway, will see. In the picture the trade lost. We could have reduced the amount it lost by using the second IB's SL value.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I don't know exactly how ATR effects the EA but I just run it up to 175 and was able to get a lot better results. Below is a chart with the same settings as the one in post #176 except the ATR was set at 10 in that one.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
The ATR is used to determine the TP. With larger ATR's we average out the size of the bars, so the EA is not affected by any spikes in the bar size, so it will generally TP much sooner. I ran a few tests on EURUSD 30M charts and found that 40 was a good figure for those. (Look back a few posts)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Noticed a subtle bug that may stop the EA taking a trade when there's another bar that almost crosses the IB threshold. Posted the first chart after this fix. I'll post an updated EA in the first post. Changed the test code to close an IB early if a second IB forms and it's crossed in the opposite trend direction (as discussed in an earlier post). This is shown in the second chart. The idea was that this would help reduce any major losses when trends go against us. Sort of works, but not enough for me to want to put it into the live code.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Today's results. Slightly better

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hmm, I'm not sure that the ATR in MetaTrader works correctly. I'd expect to see the ATR average out at higher periods. But in MetaTrader it still seems as susceptible to large bars at higher periods. The yellow line is 140 period. There's a definition of ATR here -&gt; http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...true_range_atr Can someone else verify this with their setup (non Metatrader)? Chart is USDJPY M30 for 2009/01/21.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Ika, Thanks for the great thread. I trade with GFT and the ATR is different to your platform. My platform for USD/JPY 30min ATR(20) = 0.3115 and ATR(140) = 0.2140 Regards

--- 帖子 #185 ---
These numbers make more sense for a true ATR as it is defined . Metatrader's ATR must be rear end weighted in order to climb as fast as it did on the U/J chart

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Garson , Abnormalone , Thanks for the confirmation. ATR in MetaTrader does appear to be something different to the other platforms, and to the definition of ATR. As Abnormalone says, it must be a Weighted ATR or WATR I think I'll code you my own version and see what the differences are. I want to use ATR so it averages out these large trending bars.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
1ka,FWIW here are my M30 E/U ATR values at close of NY sesion on 1/21/09. I do not use MT4. ATR 20,.0044, ATR 40,.0040, ATR 80,.0038, ATR 160,.0036, ATR 320,.0035.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Let me give you my 1 cent. I've been trading this method successfully for 5 months. I trade Inside Bar (IB) and Containing Bar (CB) only if the CB is touching Pivot line or Support/Resistance line, and only 1 of them. I.e: If the CB touches Pivot line and S1 (or R1) at same time, it's illegal. I know it means that I don't trade many optional trades but the RIsk:Reward is much higher * I also trade IB's which are before the CB and not only after it. See attachment.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Thanks Smilee89 , Do you take the break if it goes either way (short/long), or do you have a rule that determines which breaks to take? I'm about to incorporate pivots/support/resistance into the code and this could form part of the 'rules'.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Remember that Pivot Lines are determined by the end of the day of the broker time and it can be different between each broker.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Having coded my own ATR, then I can say that there's nothing wrong with MT4's ATR. It really does get affected by a large bar to that degree. Plan B.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Ouch, got hammered in the morning.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I did a small study on how only going long when above Pivot point and short when below Pivot point point would come out. I used the trades the strategy tester produced and a visual from Pivot Point on a chart to separate the trades and the results were positive. Strategy tester 117 trades 96 winners 82% -$251.86 Because strategy tester double counts winning trades this was really 71 trades 48 winners 67% Results with Pivot Points added were 32 trades 24 winners 75% -$1.20. There was one trade that should not have been included because it did not go offset plus spread above setup bar. This would add $78.00 to each total. These results were for the period 1/1/2009 to present. The EA used Max bars 9 Bar offset 0 Min ATR 10

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thanks Abnormalone . I'm still in two minds to try this, and s/r levels in general, but your analysis seems to indicate it might be worth the effort. Smilee89 would agree with you, I think. If I get time over the weekend then I'll give it a go.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Important Calculating daily pivot is accurate by doing it when midnight broker's time is at GMT+2. All other broker's time are less accurate. This because GMT+2 is when NY session is closed.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Thanks Smilee89, Do you know of any example indicators that calculate these? Saves me having to code something from scratch.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
In fact, I have this indicator that calculates pivot by the time you enter (for example 23:00 instead of 24:00), but I prefer to calculate the pivot with a simple pivot indicator on a chart that its broker ends the day on GMT+2. FXDD is a good sample. It ends on GMT+2. I dont have an account there but I only analyze with this broker.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
My Back test was flawed to some degree because I only used the same trades the strategy tester made. In real time if you eliminate one trade then the next trade may have come on a different IB and really changed the results drastically.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Better run today. Stopped the EAs at 19:45 GMT. Some initial losers from last night that may have won at 1/2 TP. Added the weekly view too.

Next weekend I will be in a very remote location round the other side of the world. I should have internet at some point, so I'll post next week's results but I can't ask my wife to fiddle with the EA! Thanks for all your hard work 1ka.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hmm, some big winners and losers in that list. I think it pays to have a spread of currencies like you are doing. I hope next week is just as profitable! The next thing for the EA is to trade long above the daily pivot point and short below it. This is something that the DIBs method does, so I'll see what effect it has. Also, after chatting in the room, someone suggested another system, similar to IBs in some respects. Since it's very simple, I'm going to code that up and see if it has more potential. (I'm really struggling to find a way to improve the IB-Trader EA)

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Oh, and if any was using the commercial Yoww EA it looks like it was a scam. See PipCop for details.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
In DIBS method, also the RR is 1:1, you take 1/2 profit and let the other half run with the same RR, until the the stop is hit. In this way, we could have caught all the pips down in all the pairs. I also think we need to be careful about different session (Asian, European, american) openings. You start to see the EU session effect from 6GMT (the break out starts here approximately 6-7 GMT). If the EA is holding the position aroud tis time, there could be very big loss (if the EA has triggered buy in the opposite side). This can be avoided by having IB true and RR at 1:1. Nice weekend guys

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Does restricting the EA to trade Long only when above the Daily Pivot Point and Short when below it make a difference? Check the results below. The first image shows results ignoring DPP and the second shows results if we take DPP into account. I can't see that it makes much difference. The win ratio is not really affected suggesting that there is an equal number of losing shorts above the DPP as there were losing longs below the DPP. Next! .

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Running the EA as is the only pairs I have been able to get good long term results doing back test on are EUR/USD EUR/JPY GBP/USD EUR/GBP and then only if I set MinATR in the 170-200 range. I believe this maybe is because they are more actively traded and trade truer to form. I am logging my trades and marking them on the charts to see if I can find which indicator if any agrees with the highest % of trades. For Friday which was the first day I started using the high ATR numbers the EA preformed pretty good just by itself.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Use DPP, but trade it only on 1h and 4H TF.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Your wish is my command Attached are four graphs showing (from Left to Right, Top to bottom) DPP Off H1, DPP On H1, DPP Off H4 and DPP On H4. The DPP does seem to work slightly better at the higher timeframes and reduces the bad trades. Mind you, the H4 timeframe on its own gives good results. Perhaps the IB method in general is suited to higher timeframes. Hmm, strategy rethink

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thanks Abnormalone , Let us know if you find 'the' indicator

--- 帖子 #212 ---
How do you determine your Stop and Take profit on the longer time frames?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
SL is the opposite side of the CB. If SL hit i take the opposite side trade on the same conditions as the origianl trade (sometime I double the lot size).

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Why am I getting the following message " IBTrader USDJPY, M30;Alert Failed to raise SELL order invalid stops" And, what should be done about it? I cannot seem to open the Expert to Modify it. Also on the EURUSD under the Experts Tab I have a long list of the Experts settings, but no trade opened. There should have been other trades opened as well, but none opened. What to check? I am using the latest EA I could find.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Are you using IBTrader.ex4 and not one of the other two. I'm not sure what the other two are and I know they don't do anything in the strategy tester.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
How would you handle weekend with the EA if you were trading live. I choose to close all trades right before the close Friday and not to turn it back on till after the market opened again on Sunday. If I had left it on I would be losing money on GBP/USD but making money on EUR/GBP and had a good trade going on EUR/JPY. Some how it did open a trade in EUR/USD (must have turned it on before that one had traded). I was afraid to leave it on for fear of gaps but I guess I should have in order to get the same trades the strategy tester would.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi: Thanks for a reply. Yes, I am using IBTrader dated Jan. 21 in the attachments folder. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Try the one in post #1, it is dated Jan 25

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Thanks. I'll try that one. I didn't realize ther was a newer version. I went by the Attachments tab above.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi Snowdogg, I have noticed these errors on occasion, I think they occur when the Sl is too close to the opening price. If your broker has a high spread then this could be a reason. Also, you may need to change some of the settings for a broker that uses 4 decimal places instead of five. The first post explains which settings to change. The IBTrader-Ind files are to enable you to add your own code to tell the EA when to buy/sell. You don't need them by default. I haven't released the main code, I'm not sure I will until it's 'working'. Enjoy (but don't use on a live account )

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I'm avoiding doing any time related code at the moment. I'm not sure the MetaTrader language can show me timezone related information. One thing I could do is to enable a property to turn off trading when set. It would still continue to manage existing trades but would not open any new ones. This would mean that you would need to set it for each EA you are running. Useful?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hmm, I've noticed this on occasion where a trade gets triggered and then price drops through the SL and out the other side. The EA won't trade the same IB twice, maybe I should relax this constraint?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Yep, Already -£30. So, we somehow need to have a small SL. Lossese are in 10s and the profits are in ones (single digits). We need to really look into this.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thanks for the replies. I will update my EA this morning. As it was, I left the "problem" one on overnight as it was plenty late. This morning, I see it has placed a slew of trades. The results are negative, but at least it was working.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I downloaded the "Pivot Point" EA to my IBFX platform but it does not show up in the chart. I have dragged and I have clicked "attach to chart" but to no avail - can someone point me in the direction. I got the EA by clicking on hard1head1's "paper clip" in the upper right hand corner. thank you.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hi piprac, Did you place it in the experts\indicators directory of your installation? You may need to exit IBFX to get it to be recompiled when you next start up.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I've posted an update to the EA and placed it in the first post. Changed BUY open trade to use spread. Added ability to only trade Long if price above Daily Pivot Point and vice versa (enable with UsePivotIndicator property) Changed the ATR trailing to be based upon a user specified factor e.g. 0.5 * ATR. Change this with the TrailATRFactor property. Removed the MaxStart parameter (well the related code). This stopped a trade opening if it was x-points past the IB. I MAY ADD THIS BACK as it may now open trades well past the opening point. Feedback is welcome. Note that the DPP is calculated with regard to YOUR timezone. MetaTrader does not seem to have the ability to retrieve time relative to GMT Notes on various stuff: The initial TP is fixed at 1/2 the ATR value. Use TPFactor to change the ATR value used. e.g. a TPFactor of 0.6 will change TP to 0.6*ATR and the initial TP will now be 0.5*0.6*ATR or 0.3*ATR. The TrailATRFactor is independent of these. So you can set an inital TP as a factor of ATR and trail the remainder with a different value.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I am sorry I can't test your EA (it seems you do a good work), as I am developing another EA for this method and I have many researches to di with it. Sorry, I can't upload it to the forum. My partners want to have it for themselves as for now.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Yes I did but it just won't show up. I don't know what's going on; I may cruise the threads and see if I can find a Pivot Point indicator somewhere and then try to install it. I would think that a Daily PP is a DPP. thanks for your help, p.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Attached is a graph showing the trades and profit by hour of day. I probably need to draw this for each currency to be more meaningful. Note that I don't often leave the EA running overnight, so these trades are not as well represented.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
And here's a currency one.

How bad can it get? .

--- 帖子 #236 ---
very intersting! im only on page 8 of this thread.... trying to read through the whole thing...... has this question been studied? just beeing impatient. like the thread so far.... will keep reading. BTW PM me if this doesn't belong in the current discusion. -Steve

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Thanks, I need to re-read the thread to create a to-do list of things The EA will attempt to follow trends with a trailing stop. I've tried leaving the stop wide open, but after a certain point it generally comes back. (On EURUSD) Haven't tried the 'same colour' rule. Anyone any experience with this?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Having watched many trends break an IB and then gently reverse to hit my SL and go 100 pips the other way, I wondered if there was any benefit in placing trades at either end. So an overhaul of the EA to place pending trades at either end of the IB was the result. The trades expire after 3 hours so they won't get hit 'accidentally'. Well, in the charts below (before/after) the results are not much better. Obviously many more trades are shown, due to ALL IBs now being tradeable and the fact we can trade both sides. A nice diversion, but not a long-term prospect, I think.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I added a routine to check for the Support and Resistance levels and to NOT trade is the price is within range. In the initial version the EA just checks to see if the price is within a 'bar' (based upon the ATR) of the S/R level. Did it make a difference? Not really, I can't see anything major. Overall win ratio goes down, but average profit/loss per trade increases/decreases which is nice. It might be worth tweaking the logic to check not only range but trade direction. i.e we can still sell if we're below the resistance lines. Might add DPP into the mix also.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Still losing.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I had a problem twice today with latest edition of EA . Running on a 1 hr. chart it opened a buy on G/U and placed the stop just a few pips below the entry price and no where near the bottom of setup bar. It run OK on 1/2 hr chart on E/U and E/J.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi Abnormalone, I think this is related to the recent change I made where I removed the MaxStart option. I've noticed that when the price jumps significantly between ticks the EA will still take the trade. I've modified the EA to put back MaxStart and suggest you use a value of 5 pips or so to avoid this situation. Sorry The latest EA is on the first post.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
You can see the realtime (well, every 5 minutes) daily trades performed by the EA here -&gt; http://oneka.mt4stats.com/

Down and down...

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Better day today... Also added the weekly and monthly.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Just started reading this thread after finishing h1h1's yesterday. When you say "stop loss to -5" is that -5 based on the trigger bar, the IB, or at the plus 20 point? Quite frankly if I don't get (understand) this IB strategy I may bail out altogether. I do see others having success so a clarification of the"-5 SL" would be appreciated. Thank you, p.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I read this as setting the SL at -5 at the +20 point. i.e we've made some profit, so bring the SL up and let the rest of the trade run. That way, we get at least +15 on the remainder and could, in theory, benefit from any significant trending that may happen. One piece of advice I would give, having tried to manually trade this and having watched the EA trade is that you should TP early, 1/2 ATR seems good, although 10 pips may be better It is very rare that an IB trade goes much further. I've lost money assuming that it would, small money admittedly, but lost all the same

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I'm having a problem with the latest version of the EA. Can not get it to make any short trades. Tried deleting it and down loaded again and still same problem.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Thanks, I hadn't noticed but it looks like I messed something up. I'll investigate. ===== OK, fixed a simple bug and updated the first thread. The interesting thing is, it did really well buying only on Friday. Perhaps it's trying to tell me something...

--- 帖子 #250 ---
To: 1ka: Thank you very much. That is the way I initially read it too but just wanted some additional input. And I have taken note, actually printed, your comment about when to take profits. Unfortunately during the 1st couple of weeks when I started exploring forex a long time ago I stumbled across a bank trader's posting someplace where he had made 7 pips for himself for almost $40K in less than 5 minutes and was on the golf course by 10:30 a.m. He admitted this was unusual and I always thought if I could find a Very High Probability Strategy then trading a large number of lots for just a few pips would be the route I would like to take, even if a longer time was involved. And I know the pitfalls and reasons not to trade like that but it still intrigues me even though I may never reach that plateau. Thanks again for your help. p.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I have been doing some back test on different indicators to see if they would show an improvement in the EA's performance. The best results that I get are on fast acting indicators. A spread sheet is attached which shows the results of using FX snipers LSMA and Macd_inColor on trades generated by the Strategy Tester on an older version of the EA . The colored sections show the trades that the indicators agreed with and the improvement they would have made. If the indicator was actually in the EA the results could vary somewhat. I deleted all the modified lines from the trades to make it easier to work with. Wish I knew now to add the indicators to the EA so I could get truer results but my old brain doesn't function like it use to.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Thanks, I'll see if I can add these indicators to the EA, using the generic interface.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Here are the latest graphs showing various profit breakdowns. 9am GMT still seems to be a good time to trade (and yes, I need to break this down by currency - still thinking of a way to display this on a chart, and working out the SQL to get this...). Note that I generally don't leave the EA trading overnight. Last weeks graphs are here and here .

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Not too bad today, but the evening still has a few trades remaining and this will probably lose another $15.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Here is the chart showing profit by hour split out for currency. Yes, it's a mess, but it does show which currencies lose most at which times. Again, the late/early trades are not equally represented. And you can ignore the Trades axis, this is purely profit. I probably need to run this for a few months to get some 'consistent' data.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Left it running overnight, bad idea At least it mostly recovered.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
OK overnight, not so good this morning. Added some IBs on the H4 chart, both triggered this morning only for the price to go the other way and hit the SL. Being H4 the IB's we're bigger and so were the subsequent losses.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Market is little crazy these days. look at the daily candle, exactly opposite to yesterday.....

--- 帖子 #259 ---
so i think, DIBS mnethod would be better option to trade IBs...Top protect the capital better to move the SL after 10 pips profit. Not only in daily, but also look at 1 hr....you will feel you missed lot of good trades.... the mirror image

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Der05, Thanks for reminding me of the DIBs method. I don't know if anyone has programmed an EA for DIBs, but that might be something I could do after this one.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Recovery?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
A number of people (Abnormalone, TraderOfForex to name but two) have suggested at various times or another that I trail the SL when we open a trade. The idea is that if the trade then bombs, we've saved a few pips. I tested this on EURUSD 30M for 2008 and the results are attached (without trailing SL and with trailing SL) We reduce our win ratio by ~3% but our average loss decreases by 20% Since it's looks to be a beneficial change, I'll make it configurable and update the first post with this change.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I have been studying all of the inside bar trading threads that I can find. These trades are working for me. I am not at the point to trust an EA. http://i40.tinypic.com/2qvtk5u.gif

I would trust mine, it's just not good at winning

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Daily and weekly results

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I see that 4H and 1D are the best time frames to trade this method.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
What do you mean by "best"? The H1 usually provides one or more trades per session.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I think by best smilee89 means that there are less losers thus increasing the overall profit. I ran some backtests on EURUSD a while back in this thread and it showed that H4 was quite good. However in recent forward testing it hasn't looked as good, probably just hitting a patch of losers. The recent change to the EA to trail the SL may actually have helped H4, we'll see next week as I'm running H4 on EURUSD and EURGBP

--- 帖子 #269 ---
From what I have read it seems that traders fool themselves into thinking one time frame is superior to another. No matter what time frame, price is the same at the same time.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Agreed However the higher timeframes can sometimes filter out the 'noise' that a lower timeframe sees. With IB's the higher timeframes filter weaker trends and show stronger trends that break the IB. Still doesn't mean that a strong trend will hit the TP point though

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Noise? A 1 tick chart is where is all starts. Every other chart is built upon that and are "conceptual" in nature. The questions are: "Where did price start and where is price now?" There is no noise only movement.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
OK, back to trading

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I found an indicator that may be worth trying. Top Trend. I back tested it on a chart and the results were good in some ways. It reduced the number of trades by 50 % but improved winning % by 3 % and improved profit by 100 %. The problem is that about 6 out of 200 trades came on bars when the indicator was at the threshold and watching them on the Strategy Tester I could not tell if it change before or after the trade was made.

I don't disagree with this, but would point out that the market view at different timeframes is not the same. A 5m timeframe may be trending up, but the 4H is trending down and is part of a larger 1D down trend. In this instance, the 5m opposite trend is just 'noise', it won't last. Perhaps I need a word other than noise

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Here are the trades taken by the EA broken down by currency and hour of day. Last weeks charts are here . 0900 GMT still seems like a good time to trade, as does 1800GMT.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi 1ka - please excuse me for butting in, but as a short TF trader - off the 5m and 1m charts - who is now looking hard at the 30m and 60 min charts to see how I can best use them to filter entries, I'd also like to comment on "noise". By definition, any inside bar on a higher TF must be represented by a pull back on a lower TF, so a 30 min IB will show up as a pull back on a 5m or 1min chart. Taking a 5 min chart, I have used the 34 ema to define the short term trend, BUT I also show two important MAs off the 60 min chart - the 20 and 50, thus I can easily see the longer term trend without changing chart. All moves start with the PA off the lower TF, so last week's 790 pip rally in cable started on Monday at 12:27 GMT as the early US traders stopped the 190 drop right at the 4050 level. PA via a higher low on the 1 min chart at 12:44 GMT was the first signal confirming the bounce up off the 4050 level as a buy. At 13:00GMT this was confirmed by the breakout of the 30 min IB at 4100 - another Sweet Spot / Physchl level. At this time, price was well under the 60 min MAs which were still sloping down. It was another 24 hours before price moved above these hourly MAs and confirmed the trend change. Thus we had a clear example of how the PA off the 1 min chart clearly picked up the reversal into the 790 pip rally - quite useful "noise". The attached chart shows the action so far today. The 30 min IB at 23:30 GMT last night gave a buy signal, but the 5 min PA showed the early failure of the rally for a tradable fall and the clear higher low after LO signaled a buy - which I took. The 30min IB at 7:30 gave confusing signals - not surprising as it was still in "Frankies Hour" and the Brits were not yet active. However, the two green MAs confirm that SO FAR the move has only been a pull back and the rally remains in force. PA around the 4850 level will confirm a continuation OR the start of a larger pull back....I've already banked pips at the 4800 level and trailed my stop on the remainder....TWT

Abnormalone, Thanks, how are you using this? It's a variant of Bollinger Bands with the extremes cut off, or so it appears. I tried just trading IBs if the price was in the Bollinger Band channel, didn't have a great effect. I'll read up on Bollinger strategies and adjust my use of the indicator to suit.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
It stay red as long as the price stay near the bottom band and I only did shorts. When it runs into the top band it changes to blue and I only made long trades. Seems like once price runs into either side it stays there and head in that direction for awhile.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Nice, I see you are using the Inner Bar as your trigger for the breakout. I've been using the Outer Bar so would be interested to see how you get on

--- 帖子 #281 ---
OK, I tried a similar thing with the Bollinger Bands (BB). The first graph shows the trades without BB The second shows trades with BB. Here we only trade Long when the price is in the upper band and Short when in the lower one. The third is a variation of this in that we don't trade if the price goes outside the BB (which are at the default 2 standard deviations) Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this makes a positive impact

--- 帖子 #287 ---
It's not a problem. Just that I've been following this thread (recently deleted ) that suggests trades are triggered when the price passes the High/Low of the Outside Bar. I might tweak the code to use the inside bar and see whether I get better results from that. ===== Hang-on, I already have that code - let me run the tests again.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
OK, that explains why my backtesting doesn't do so well. Attached are the charts for EURGBP H1. First one uses the outside bar and the second uses the inside bar as the trade trigger. TP is 1/2 ATR, SL set at the other end of the bar.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Today's results.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
From the first page: So what are Inside Bars? Simply put it's where a bar on the chart closes with a lower high and a higher low than the previous bar. But what is it really? It's a point of consolidation. The current trend has stopped and there's a moment of indecision as the currency fluctuates between a previous high and low. So what causes it? Anything and everything. All we know for sure is that the current trend has paused. It could have hit a point of support or resistance where there is enough buying or selling pressure to stop it going further. It could be that there is an overbought or oversold condition. It could be there's a news release imminent and the market is waiting, etc., etc. What happens next? Ideally, a new trend starts that breaks the bounds of the Inside Bar and goes on for a few hundred pips. Am I doing it "wrong"? Cause it's working http://i40.tinypic.com/w2dg5e.gif

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi Money, I believe that there are at least two ways of deciding your entry when trading the IB. One is to use the high and low of the current IB. (DIBS) The second is to use the high and low of the OB that cradles your current IB (H1H1) The thread that preceded this. Hence: "Money4Nothing is trading the Inside Bar," DIBS "... we've been trading the Outside Bar." H1H1 On the other hand, I have it all round my neck and understand nothing!!!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
All I am doing is trading the inside bar breakout. I don't know how to use outside bars. http://i41.tinypic.com/2eoi3qo.gif

--- 帖子 #305 ---
It's the same principle. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Notice that bars straddle the Outer Bar of the Inside Bar method. A trade was taken, green arrow, when the upper level of the Outer Bar was broken. You would have taken the trade as it topped past the white bar. (or possibly the bottom of it as it may just sneaked past - would have lost though ).

The only thing I can think is that the price jumped more than 5 pips as it broke the IB. You could increase the MaxStart to 10 pips and that might resolve the issue.

Where do you place your stop. at the high of the bar if it is a sell? and at the low of bar if it is a buy? If the bar has a long range where do u place your stop? I notice if price move up and down of an IB and there is no new IB form, I see that you still used the high and low of that last IB. Can you give some rules for the newguys

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Ouch.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I don't place a stop. I am trading live. Either price is making me money or taking my money. You don't have to "guess". If price moves against me more than 5 pips and doesn't act like it wants to come back, I exit. Think of it this way... If you get on a subway car and realize it's heading the opposite direction, what do you do? The longer you stay on, the more it will cost you when you finally get off. Rules? Use H1 chart. Go long at the high of the most recent inside bar when price moves up to it. Go short at the low of the most recent inside bar when price moves down to it. Use money management and risk management to determine your position size and stop. The main thing is do not think. In other words, take the trade when price hits the line. You will either win or lose. You don't need indicators to filter out trades. Only trade one pair until you get the hang of it. I usually only trade 2 pairs: EURUSD and GBPUSD. P.S. It seems like you already have more than enough indicators on your chart ( hurts my eyes ) . By the way, if you change the charts properties ( uncheck chart on foreground located in the common tab), the blue inside bar lines will be clearer. P.P.S. from THE TRADING ZONE, Mark Douglas page 121 1) Anything can happen 2) You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money. 3) There is a random distribution between the wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. 4) An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. 5) Every moment in the market is unique.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
How many pairs are being traded? What sessions are being traded? Is there a hit daily goal and quit option? Perhaps running one EA per session will tell you the best times to trade and one EA per pair will tell you the best pair(s) to trade.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I forgot to mention, learn how to take 3 - 5 net pips really quick. Don't worry about how much you could have made. After you get this down, you should be aware when price is going to go your way or is going to reverse on you. If price goes your way and stop moving, take it before price reverses on you. I saw 10 - 20 pip profits vanish in a couple of seconds today but I was already out of the trade. That will happen to you if you try to squeeze out another pip or 2. http://i42.tinypic.com/2r4id8p.gif

are you trading purely IB breaks? Not filtering it as per the DIBS method? Just curious. Also how long have you been doing this for? I actually like your idea on using only a pair or two, that way you will get the feel for that market. My problem is I try trade everything and anything that appears as if it is equal without understanding that pair. Some pairs move better/worse during different trading sessions (for eg UJ in Asia , AUD in asia, EURUSD and GBPUSD in UK, CAD in US type things)

I am trading IB breaks. Just started trading IB breaks a little while ago. I don't have any trading "secrets" and that probably works in my favor since I don't second guess.

There always seems to be action in GBPUSD and EURUSD though it's a little slow after New York closes for about 2 - 3 hours.

Money4Nothing are you basicly doing a straddle of the IB candle placing a buy stop AND a sell stop on the IB I've been using 30 min TF and only playing the side of the trend Also I'm taking the high low of the prevoius candle before the IB. I'm doing well but I see on E/U at the time of the IB I placed a Sellstop(red arrow) it didn't hit but the bar moved way up so I lost the oppertunity of the Buy stop If you caught that you got over 50 pips and counting as of this pic ps you are doing a great job!

I've updated the EA on the first post . Based upon the graphs above, I thought it might be useful to change the EA so that it will trade at certain hours.

I noticed more the IB is small more the signal is better. Maybe is it possible to get a different colour of the IB if the IB is smaller than the half of the previous bar ? blue for a normal IB and yellow for a small IB easier to see on the charts the good signals

Well, nothing new about being confused but I thought one could post an indicator as long as it is free public domain and the author said anyone can use it. But if the indicator sent the viewer to a blog, some kind of commercial site, wanted a "donation", then it was banned. Am I wrong? I think some of the banned posters really pushed/bent the rules and the mods had no choice but maybe I'm confused about that too. p.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I think a ban is only imposed if there is a link to a commercial site, if the indicator is freely available and not copyrighted then I don't think there's any issue with posting it on here, perhaps a Mod will correct me if I'm wrong Andy

http://i40.tinypic.com/sw466f.gif I have been receiving PMs asking about indicators. I am staying out of the indicator war. If you learn and practice the inside bar trade, you will not need indicators. In the end, indicators cause you to think and that slows you down because you start second guessing your decision to enter/exit. Plotting the lines by hand makes you focus on what you are doing, your head is in the game. Yes, my charts look clean because I have contaminated them with a bunch of lagging indicators. Price tells me which way it is moving, not some lagging indicator. Thank you.

Rule #2: Trading Only Forex Factory is all about trading. Anything focused on the pursuit of trading profits is welcome - anything focused on something else is subject to removal. Keep in mind that Forex Factory is a global community, so controversial discussions (i.e., politics, religion, nationalism) should be kept to an absolute minimum. Additionally, the site should not be used to for personal agendas such as ego, drama, attention or revenge. If that is really true, then posting charts shouldn't be a problem.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
The difference is you are using a different system of IB then the one that was started in this thread. Your entry is when price breaks the hi or lo of the inside bar. The system advocated by h1h1 is to enter on the break of the bar previous to the IB. This will always result in a "poorer" entry price then your system, especially in trending markets. In ranging markets, your system will whip-saw you more and may keep the other sytem out of some poor trades.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Also the TP will make a difference, number of currencies, times traded, etc. I'm letting the EA 'just run' to collect stats on all the above.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
hi 1ka, I do something similar for the time being. just let them run with different setups and see. Anyone knows a documented journal with statistics ?

--- 帖子 #483 ---
It's easy to show wins but here are some losses and not sure why . . luck of the draw or did I do something wrong The trend was up I was above the daily open I was above the 89 line went through support level Any thoughts or comments

--- 帖子 #484 ---
This one maybe too close to the support line but later in the day it took off?????

--- 帖子 #485 ---
hi 1ka, Not sure what you meant. you limited the Outside bar or the Inside Bar. &gt; IB Limit 60 are this 60 Pips ??

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Actually, this chart is cumulative, not just for that week. (Note to self - word next charts posting differently ) I don't always leave the EA running overnight, so the trades from 10pm to 7am are not proportionately represented.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
The limit applies to the maximum size of the Outside Bar. That's an old setting, maybe from an older version of the EA? The latest EA uses MaxIBSize and is measured in points. The EA is on the first post.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
I don't think you did anything wrong, as it all looked fine. Major trend was with you too. Can't see any scheduled news at that time, but maybe something happened? The only comment I have is that it had been consolidating for a while. My 'noob' view is that it can go anywhere after that If it helps, then the EA was suckered too.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi 1ka Are you running your EA on 1-hr chart only or on 30 min too, as originally suggested by H1H1?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Mainly on 30M. Two are running on 4H using a stochastic oscillator to determine when to trade.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
When all the winning percentages increase as the Max Bar size increases would this not indicate that we need to eliminate the smaller bars

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hi Abnormalone, Is this the size of the Inside Bar, not the Outside Bar, since it appears you are using the non-H1H1/Jim method? I might add a MinIBSize parameter into the EA so that you can ignore smaller bars. When I get some time I'll see if I can test this in the EA.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I did not realize I had Use IB turned on till after I did the test but I assumed the MaxBar size still used the set up bar. If I get time I will rerun the test with Use IB turned off.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Same test with Use IB turned off. Basically looks the same but improved percentages.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Interesting I actually only implemented the MinIBSize parameter But you are far ahead of me. 1ka what was your main reason to have the MaxBar size parameter?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
The idea was that we could limit the maximum potential loss by setting a limit on the maximum size of IB. Works OK, but didn't make a difference on the overall win-ratio as far as I can remember. (Not sure if I actually did a back-to-back comparison).

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi Money4Nothing, Thanks for sharing your strategy. Two questions: 1. What sessions are you trading? 2. Do you trade (if it happens) two breakouts per IB - one up and one down? Or do you re-enter if stopped out before take profit? Thanks Thomas

--- 帖子 #500 ---
It's not my strategy. 1. What sessions are you trading? I trade the current session. 2. Do you trade (if it happens) two breakouts per IB - one up and one down? Or do you re-enter if stopped out before take profit? I take the trade when it happens, see my signature. You are welcome.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi Money4Nothing, Once it moves in your direction do you enter a stop at break even? Do you take partial profit when price stalls? What about the GBPUSD from one hour ago? Can you elaborate a bit in regards of profit taking? Did you close the trade when it came back and made the pullback after 5min? Thanks T.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I had 4 positive trades this a.m. for +39 pips total and no losses. I basically use M4N's modifications except when using the trigger bar H or L I add 3-4 pips and use a Buy or Sell Stop order. I use IBFX. If I can refine this some more then it seems that getting 10 pips should not be a problem and furthermore if one traded 5 standard lots that's $500/day on the E/$. Foregoing Fri trading that would mean $2000/week and I think that is realistic IF I can build up to 5 standards. My trades: 05:18 CST, 1H TF, E$, E - 1.2604, C - 1.2614, +10 06:32 30M, E/Y, E - 116.75, C - 116.68, +7 +17 tot. 07:01 lb/$, 30M, E - 1.4228, C - 1.4238, +10 +27 tot. 08:05 lb/$, 30M, E - 1.4245, C - 1.4257 +12 +39 tot. and done for the day. I am going to start using 1/2 of 9 ATR for a TP target and adjust from there. I did not follow my own rules completely in the above orders as my thinking was evolving plus if the price danced around or stalled somewhat then I took profit. I will learn how to post pictures this weekend so i can show charts and entries, etc. thanks to all for the input, p.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Let me try to explain... I do not think. I trade with the price flow. I enter the trade at the line. That is all that I do. It's not rule-based nor is it gut-feel. It is SEE-DO. I see the flow and trade with it. If price flows against me, I exit. If price flows with me and then stops, I exit. Nothing is set in stone. Price is fluid. To be rigid against price is futile. I'm sure other posters know much more than I do. I haven't added anything to or taken anything from the inside bar breakout trade setup.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
No offense but it sounds ambiguous to me. You say that once the price flows against, you exit. But you need to know how far is too far. There's a specific limit on a loss. Otherwise, you'll be cutting off trades that eventually goes in your favor. I give you credit for the see-do part, as I trade in a similar fashion.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
One reason that smaller IB's may cause a problem is that they appear inside of larger IB's. I believe that one of HardHead's rules is that you trade the first bar in the sequence. This may be a poor example because it is so many bars long but the same thing could happen in a shorter sequence.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
What is "ambiguous"? Price moves one away and then the other only change direction again. Does that make price "ambiguous"? I can not foretell the future. How would one know, at the time, if they are "cutting off trades that eventually goes in their favor" vs. stopping a catastrophic loss? http://i44.tinypic.com/2jcyk9x.gif

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I do not understand what you mean by "right trade" and "wrong trade". I looked at your chart and see opportunities both times.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
However, trading Jim's way, you would only take one. I trialled an EA that set up pending limit orders at the IB bounds. It would trade both if price went one way then reversed. Trades expired after a period of time if they weren't hit. Didn't get any better results with that method either I might try it again with a SL&amp;TP of 10pips, just to see what pops out.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Has nothing to do with your way of trading. We are trying to develop an EA and at the moment trying to figure out a way to eliminate certain trades that do not meet the requirements of the threads originator.

I'm 4 for 5 today took a hit on that one E/J the price spiked in the wrong direction and triggered my stop order I didn;t trade on the screen shot Too close to the 89 lin too close to the daily opne and to close to daily pivot

--- 帖子 #511 ---
From Post #1: "Everyone is welcome to discuss the IB technique. In particular, it would be interesting to hear what works, and doesn't work, for you." I apologize if my posts aren't to your liking. I thought this was an inside bar trading thread and that anything related to inside bar trading was welcome.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
You still need to know how far is too far. You can't go far profit wise just cutting the trade at the first sign of weakness. Would be understandable, if you're scalping or trading on a shorter time frame. 1 hr charts accumulates enough data, no need to cut the trade that short. Yes, nobody can tell the future. But you need to balance things out. Cutting the trades too short will have a negative impact on your bottom line, as bad as losses, maybe worst.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I agree with balance. "How far is too far"? That's up to the trader. I can't decide for you and I won't allow you to decide for me. I take what I can, when I can - is that scalping? All that matters at the end of the day is profit/loss. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Deciding or not on what you can take, I think this comment specifically is completely unnecessary. The things that you're cutting your trades short, probably too short. You come here and post charts and everything, that's fine. But I doubt very much you have sustained profitability going that route. "How far is too far", I really don't care a rat ass on what you can or can't take, seriously and personally. Just that, in the way you show things, indirectly has raised the questions people are asking. It's perfectly alright to raise questions about trade management. You get defensive when it comes down to that. Makes me wonder....

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Did not mean to imply there was anything wrong with your posts. I like your style of trading but do not have the time or patience to trade your way myself. Just hoping we can develop an EA that will trade successfully for us.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
It's not "my way". I did not invent or create inside bar trades and can't take credit for it. I am only a practitioner of inside bar trading.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Maybe someone can test the EA with this rule: Inside Bar (IB) is a legal IB only if its high and low is inside the high and low of the outer bar. At least most of the IB's high and low. See example.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Surely that's the definition of an IB? or do you mean the body of the IB should be within the body of the preceding bar? Andy

--- 帖子 #520 ---
No, that's not the definition of an IB. This is my interpretation. The body of the IB should be inside the body of the outer bar, or at least most of the IB's body. I only suggest to test it in the EA.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hi Smilee89, With the EA, the inside bar High/Low must be totally enclosed by the High/Low of the outside or containing bar. We've got some people who trade when the price breaks the High/Low of the inside bar, and some, from Jim's thread, who trade when the price breaks the High/Low of the outer bar. The EA can trade either.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Do you have any statement of the EA with this rule? (In other words, did you run a backtest and can show us the statement?)

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi Smilee89, All the tests by the EA associated with this thread use this rule and work off the outer bar unless otherwise stated. They're sprinkled throughout this thread. Alternatively view all the posts by my name. The live forward tests and charts are all based around this

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Oops. I am sorry. I meant something different. The body of the IB should be inside the body of the outer bar. *body means between the open and the close (without the spikes). See the examples in post #520. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=520

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Thanks for the clarification. I haven't tried this method, it might be worth looking at. I assume that the same rules apply, i.e. only trade when price breaks the outer bars body? We're ignoring the shadows, in other words.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I tried the same test I used yesterday on EUR/JPY where I eliminate the small IB's but this time on EUR/USD for a longer time period and the results were terrible.

SETUP... I wonder if the shorts will cover before rollover today? http://i44.tinypic.com/2cs9v7o.gif

--- 帖子 #529 ---
I did not think that way but maybe it works better if we trade only when price breaks the outer bars body (ignoring spikes). I did not make any difference if we ignore the spikes for entering a trade. The most important is that the IB's body is inside the CB's body. Some will enter a trade when price breaks the high/low of the IB, other will enter a trade when price breaks the high/low of the CB, and others will enter a trade when price breaks the body (without spikes) of the CB. I would like that the EA will test these options.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
I'm not sure you can trade when price breaks the body of the IB, as, by definition, the price will be at the open/close of the IB anyway. Probably only the CB is an option.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I did not mention this option at all.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
SETUP... http://i43.tinypic.com/2ivikwm.gif

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I made a mistake in Post # 526. When you use a Min. Setup bar size with EUR/USD it does show an improvement. In the attached spread sheet rows 26 and 27 show the statistics for the EA by itself and what using a Min Setup Bar size would be. If you change the number in the Red Cell you can see what effect eliminating smaller size Setup bars would have on profit and winning trade percentages. What ever number you enter will eliminate trades with a Smaller Setup bar than the number you entered. The statistics for the EA have been adjusted to reflect what the real trade numbers should be when the winning trades are not double counted like the Strategy Tester does.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I stand corrected

--- 帖子 #535 ---
1ka, looking at your daily screen shots - they look rather pessimistic don't they? Are this all on the 30 min chart ?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Yes, the last few weeks haven't been too good for the EA I'll keep running it just to get the statistics on best times and currencies.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
In the beginning my main test strategy did not look too promising either (but still better than the first IB impression ;-) The difference was when I found a better TP/SL ration and some kind of more suitable filtering. By now it actually looks quite promising. My IB tests I had to change to lower time frame (using now 15 min). My main trouble is that I can not properly backtest with my system. And on the other higher Time frames there are just not enough signals to draw any conclusion in a resonable time. I tried your EA (don't know about MT4) but having some small problem When I change for instance MaxIBSize it also always enters values: Not sure if that is a problem??

--- 帖子 #538 ---
That looks OK to me. The Value is the one that is used. The others are used in optimising and allow you to change the values dynamically during the back-testing.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Thanks that helps - did not know that. Maybe you also know this: when I run the EA - is there a way to see visually (on the chart) where a trade would be entered and TP or SL. get this kind of errors using visual mode?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
These errors mean that your data has missing bits in it. You could go into the History Centre and download new data for that timeframe. When running in visual mode, you can see the trade open, close, SL &amp; TP values. Double click on the trades in the results tab and it will move the chart to the trade. Only seems to store the last few hundred though. When running in visual mode you can skip to the end, still updates the charts but is much quicker.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
really appreciate your help, very kind of you 1ka.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
I ran a quick check following on from Abnormalone's idea of using a Minimum Limit on the IB size. The next series of posts show the effect on EURUSD, the IB Limits are: None, 5, 10 &amp; 15 pips.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
As above, the IB Limits are 20, 25, 30 &amp; 35 pips

--- 帖子 #544 ---
As above, the IB Limits are 40, 45, 50 &amp; 55

--- 帖子 #545 ---
As above, the IB Limits are 60, 70 &amp; 80

--- 帖子 #546 ---
The results confirm what Abnormalone found, that the profit increases if we restrict the smaller IB sizes. The optimum seems to be around the 30~40 pip range, where we still get a good throughput of trades and maintain a reasonable profit. As we increase the limit, then our trades drop off and we start to get bigger losses. I'll modify the EA later today to add the Minimum limit and put it on the first post. Nice work Abnormalone. Any luck with other currencies or timescales?

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I'm Working on GBP/USA now will take some time yet. Wondering if the fact we will be working with bigger IB,s, if putting a limit on the Stop Loss at maybe 60 or so pips might help cut the larger losses down. When I did the spread sheet I forgot to subtract spread and offset from the Setup Bar size so your numbers should come out about 8 to 10 pips lower than the sheet would show.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
After I posted that spread sheet I added a column so I could get a graph and it looked a little smother than the ones you posted. I had Trail stop turned off and I wounder if that made a difference or maybe it was just a characteristic of the spread sheet.

Hi Money, Hope all is well with you. I was lucky to be in on the money on the GBP/USD downside shift you mentioned. I know you don't use any indicators when you trade, besides just price action, but on MACD histogram on the 30M chart, you could see negative divergence, and it was only time before price turned south. Nice trade! Best wishes to you and thank you for posting up your setups. Very cool! Algis

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hello Algis: Thanks for the greeting. I don't use the usual lagging indicators, I use gauges that tell me in real time what price is doing on all the time periods. It just seems to me that if any indicator or system worked then there would be no market. If one knew for certain what the next tick would be, then it would eventually be the end of trading. Divergence works sometimes but not all the time. You just have to take your chances in the trading game. The reason you entered at a particular time and price doesn't matter. If your indicator based system determined a long entry at 1.4567 and a flip of coin determined the same entry at the same time, it will make no difference. All that matters is what happens next and that is not in your control. The market determines that. You just get to exit with a profit or loss. Those are not really "my setups". Those are just inside bar trade setups. I didn't invent them, so I can't take credit. I am just a practitioner of inside bar trades. And you're welcome.

Some thoughts: 1. I implemented a MinOutSideBar: from my small testing it seems the: if the very small once are excluded it is better. 2. there might be still value in having a Min IB count before a signal is accepted:like MasterCandle ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=140130 ) 3. (I have an additional check for how many candles I keep a signal valid) reason I don't use MarketOrders for this system. And what happens if a spike (valid or not valid happens -- just as the pic below) 4. maybe a possible idea would be to configure: MasterCandle == OutSideBar * StopLoss_InPercentOfMasterCandleHighLow * TakeProfit_InPercentOfMasterCandleHighLow * OrderEntryOffset_InPercentOfMasterCandleHighLow Basic Idea: a expected outbreak extend is in some relation to the size of the MasterCandle(OutSideBar)

Not a good morning for me but I did accidently saw something that I will look at closely next week. I only look at the 4 majors: E/4, cable, swissy, and $/Y so I note the D. &amp; 4H overall trend. The 1H &amp; 30M which I trade were many times counter trending this a.m. but not the 15M. The 15M IB is a trading strat. over on BP; it gets some heat once in a while because it now requires a monthly payment if you want to follow the "live" session via skype. Of course a SL &amp; TP target would be smaller but I wonder if this is a viable idea - I will check it out next week. Please comment if you like and good trading all, p.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Can't one just look at their own M15 charts? What's the point of a "live" session - either price triggers the trade or it doesn't? http://i40.tinypic.com/2m7bzex.gif

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I just finished a Spread sheet on GBP/USD. The 8 month period tested showed a good size loss to start with. I was able to improve the loss but not make it turn a profit. To many trades were stopped out in the 100-120 pip range.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
May I suggest you have your EA run statistics on the entries. See what the frequency distribution is for the run up is after the entry. This will tell you how many trades didn't stand a chance. It will also tell you what your TP should be for maximum wins. I ran some statistics on 10,000 H1 bars and it looks like 203 bars out of 1185 didn't have a prayer. http://i43.tinypic.com/15mbq7p.gif

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Not sure why I have different numbers but what is interesting is that 60% of pip gain is in the less than 20 pips 41% less than 10 for me

--- 帖子 #559 ---
I'm feeling especially dense today, so apologies With reference to M4N's post above, is this a measure of the max. pips a trade would make after breaking the IB? i.e. of 395 trades (1/3 or 33.3%) only make 1-9 pips?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
That's what his chart says mine was less than 27% also 15% show zero gain on mine

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Thanks, that's what I thought. So for the EA to TP at 1/2 ATR, say 15 pips, then 1/2 of all trades are going to fail. Anyone know how these stats are calculated? Is it just the size of the bar that breaks the IB, or does it look at the following bars. (I don't think it does, otherwise trends would make an appearance with &gt;100pip trends, and there aren't any.) Lies, damned lies and statistics

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Different brokers = different numbers. A 1 pip difference could mean the difference between a bar being an inside bar or not.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
The statistics only look at the bar following the IB.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
I just did a crude test with 1 hour data that shows 52% going to 15 pips within the next 8 bars. Only 8% went past 100 pips

Did you check the draw down distribution, too?

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I used a crude spread sheet. Took no consideration for smaller IB's that may have been inside of bigger ones. In that case the small IB breakout may have been 30 pips but the breakout of the larger one may have been only 10 pips. Have not been able to figure out a way to determine draw down on a spread sheet. Hard to write a formula that can determine what time you entered a trade and then the low or high price after that.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Can you guys restrict the time of the day? For example, 6GMT to 14 GMT.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I have a question. I hope it hasn't been answered already. What if there are two inside bars... the second IB beeing an IB to the previous. example 100 pip bar followed by 75 pip bar followed by 50 pip bar (of course the 75 and the 50 pip bars falling within the range of the 100 pip bar,.... aaaaaaaaand as if i need to say it,... the 50 pip bar falling within the range of the 75 pip bar. Do you use both IBs or just the most recent? Gosh i hope this makes sense.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I am not sure about this on EA, In real case, this may indicate sideways movement?. Better to stay out, or get in and out wiht few +ve pips or at BE.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Using 1/2 hour data on EUR/USD for the past 8 months (more volatile that first half of last year) and going out 10 bars the percentages look a little better. 1629 total IB's 10% made 107 pips 20% 76 30% 60 40% 45 50% 36 60% 28 70% 21 80% 13 90% 7

--- 帖子 #572 ---
The EA only trades the latest IB. I did write an EA that placed pending limit orders on both sides of every IB, that didn't seem to perform any better, though I may revisit it in light of the recent developments in this thread.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
When I did the last percentage sheet I noticed there were only about 1100 IB's during that time frame but about 500 broke each side.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
once a while i use IB but more into 4hrs TF PS: very high risk so i use small pips..

--- 帖子 #578 ---
That is what I do: pending limit orders on both sides and if one get's filled cancel the other - or if the signal validation time is over - cancel both.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi MJ, I just left them both so if the price reversed both could get hit. Played around with different expiry times and different timeframes on EURUSD. Nothing struck me as being particularly profitable. I'll run it again with a smaller TP and see if that's better.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
hi 1ka, I must temporary stop my tests -- my PC is not able to handle all this over 80 bots running simultaneously and my main test system is doing quite OK so I prefer testing on that. Seems I have to go one step at the time http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif On my journal I put a link to your thread. I still want to point out that it might be worthy to check out if the DIBS rule: Only be willing to buy a market if it is up on the day. Only be willing to sell a market if it is down on the day. Makes a difference. Post #23 Trading the "hot hand": Trading the strongest/weakest market is actually really simple. For example, yesterday the Eur/Usd was up more proportionately than the Usd/Chf was down. This was because the Usd/Chf wasn't even a down day. Definitely off its highs but not down relative to last week's close. The Eur/Usd was up, up and away! So that is the market you buy. And I did! I'm sure I had company from this group. In the pit the first thing you learn--- when you are ready to actually make money..., and stop the bleeding, is: Only be willing to buy a market if it is up on the day. Only be willing to sell a market if it is down on the day. Obviously, it would logically follow that the currencies which are up more are better buys and the ones down more are the better shorts. So basically, if you get a buy setup forming on two strong currencies, take the trade on the one up most on the day. This actually means that you never go short a currency unless it is "down" relative to yesterday's close; or go long for any reason unless the market is "up" on the day. Review for yourself how many large losses you could've eliminated from your past trades if you followed these rules. At the same time, I am certain you would have eliminated very few of your biggest winners by doing this. Think about this for a while. I have for decades. The power of this simple concept still amazes me. I'm sure this sounds simplistic to everyone, and maybe this stuff is obvious to you all, but I doubt it. How many times do you find yourself buying a weaker currency instead of the stronger one, thinking that the weaker one "has" to catch up, or the stronger one has already moved as much as it is likely to already. Always buy setups in the strongest daily markets, always take sell orders in the weakest daily markets. Not sure how that applies for lower time frames.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
"Not sure how that applies for lower time frames." Price is the same and moves the same on all time frames relative to the same point in time. In other words, from the daily open, price is up/down the same no matter what chart period you are looking at. http://i44.tinypic.com/4vnxnn.gif http://i43.tinypic.com/2nr398i.gif

--- 帖子 #582 ---
No Money4Nothing, I meant something differently: Not sure according to DIBS if the Daily reference point would still apply using lower time frames. for instance: 5 min Time Frame - using the last 4 hour as reference for up/down. &gt; Price is the same and moves the same on all time frames relative to the same point in time. But: 1. exactly that's the point 'relative to the same point in time.' Using a closing price of the last Candle on different Time Frames is at different points in time. 2. for indicators or Candles the results are still different as they use not the same point in time as reference - but usually the same number of 'time spans' = Candles to calculate the results across time frames.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I did a spread sheet on EUR/JPY eliminating the small IB's today and the results show improvement similar to that of EUR/USD.

I don't have any data to prove otherwise but I see a lot of IB's that appear to break out for big gains in a counter trend. I will try to find a way to determine if the EA made better gains trading long only if above the daily open and short if below the the daily open. What time do you consider as the open. Different brokers start their daily bars at different times. I know the EA makes better trades if it dose not trade between the NY close and London open.

Limiting the Long trades to only buy if price was above Daily open and short only if price was below Daily open does not seem to improve the EA. It would appear that just the opposite could be true. EA without limits 1202 trades $122.35 profit EA when limited 763 trades $77.07 profit Two possible reasons and this is just my opinion which could be completely wrong. An IB get formed when price has been traveling in one direction for a while and reaches a point where no one is willing to buy anymore if price has been moving up, or sell anymore if price has been moving down. In the first case if the IB does break to the top side the buyers are still limited. But if price breaks to the down side then the people who bought early in the cycle start selling in order to take profit and thus accelerate the down side momentum. A second reason may be that a news item is due to be released and no one is willing to trade either direction till after the news. After the news price could move either direction depending on if its good or bad. I have not read the DIBS forum but I thought they only dealt with daily bars in which case any time they trade it would have to be above the open to break the top side and below the open to break the down side.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I read a post where the trader only placed one or two orders per day. If the first one was profitable, he quit. If the first trade was a loss, he entered a second trade. Win or lose, that was it. Only 2 per day. Perhaps the EA may be profitable using that idea?!?!

--- 帖子 #590 ---
He quick or quits?

I did not check that either: but it seems that the DIBS method looks back at a longer history so I would not easily disregard such input. Also it might not work the same on all time frames. Thanks for all the effort some of you putting in.

Maybe, but you're assuming he had no directional bias, and was taking every break, regardless of direction. When i get consecutive Inside Bars, I will be inclined to trade the range of the preceeding, larger ranging bar. At the very lest, if i enter on the smaller bar, i will leave my stop above the high of the first IB. The USDJPY trade is pretty choppy, but using this method, you would still be short. Cheers, MM

Regarding his method, there is no bias. If price breaks the high's - Long If price breaks the low's - Short.

This is what drives me crazy I placed a buy stop at 62.49 as you can see in the picture the price never hit it the closest it got was 62.38 but it still placed the order as of this writting it turned around and is positive but still not sure how this happens

--- 帖子 #614 ---
What was the ASK at the time? EAs buy at the ask and sell at the bid, if I am not mistaken. Charts ( candles ) show only the BID.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Today's results.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
That could be it I'll have to check but on placing stops I thought they triggered when the ask was hit mine was 62.49

--- 帖子 #617 ---
The ASK is never hit. You buy at the ASK and sell at the BID. The chart price is the BID.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
That would be the spread. I normally add the spread to the trigger line for buy stops. I also add the spread for stop losses on shorts. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
The original h1h1 entry parameters said to Sell at the Low minus 3 pips of the trigger bar. I haven't checked to see if this ever got revised.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
... and to BUY at the high+3pips+spread.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
These are the rules I've been folowing: and the script I use does it. Once the Inside Bar is formed, you take the High and the low of the previous candle. When the price breaks to the low side 3 pips below the trigger candle low a stop is placed 5 pips above the high of the same candle and the opposite is the same for longs. Entry will vary, you can put a T/P at the nearest Pivot point or you can watch the trade and try to ride it out. You can pull your stop to B/E and just wait for the big ones or you can just settle with 10 or 15 Pips. There are many ways to make it work so lets give it a try. Profit Targets: If you are trading 1 mini then you have no choice but to target 1/2 the ATR value at the time of the IB as shown in the 2nd chart below, or the first line of support or resistance, such as a Pivot Point or a distict low or high.. If you can pull profit, then you would pull 1/2 of your profit off at the ATR or first line of support or resistance and move stop to B/E and let the other 1/2 run to Support or resistance or double the first value. What I feel happen was the spread got me I don't account for the spread

I trade the 15M TF, SL is the opposite end of the IB unless the IB was a big mover, then I use some percentage of the overall move that the IB made (50% neigborhood). I trade the Big 4 plus EUR/GBP during the NY session as I can't get interested in getting up at 1 a.m. for London. Tried it but not sharp or quick at that hour. Good luck all. p.

Money4nothing. I understand how/why you enter a trade, but would you mind explaining what your thoughts are concerning Stoplosses and Takeprofits?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Ok, fair enough but how do you decide when a trade is against you? Lets say you enter a trade buying GPGUSD on a breakout of an inside bar. Will you exit a trade immediately if the trade goes against you by say 10 pips? Or will you leave room for the trade to "breathe"? This also leads me to the opposite scenario, when to take profits. How do you decide this? Is it when you feel that a positive breakout trade loses momentum? Sorry if my questions might seem dumb to you, im just trying to pick your brain here... regards Ronny

When price is moving against me. I might be out at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.... When I can. You're questions are not dumb... By asking questions, you reveal your fears. There is no trick. There is no secret. Either you decide to trade or you decide to watch. "You Have to Be In the Trade to Win the Trade ." All the charts, indicators and systems will be of no use to you unless you enter the trade. Most indicators are of no use anyway and most systems lose. Your only hope of winning is to master your fears. You see my charts and think, "That's the secret. If I had those charts, I could make money." There is nothing on my chart that can help you at all... nothing! If you can't see an inside bar without an indicator, then you don't understand inside bars. If you can't place a couple of lines where they need to be, then you don't understand the setup. If you can't tell which way price is moving by looking at the chart, then you probably shouldn't be trading. Price either moved up or moved down. Those are the only two options. The only bar on the chart that means anything at all is the current bar. I am no "guru". I am just another trader. That's all. I don't have all the answers. I don't have anything that you need. When you ask me questions, you are looking for an answer that will give you confidence to pull the trigger. You must find that confidence within.

First nice work you do http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif What I was wondering: at the Hour of day chart: Can you see anything significantly different (like Inside Bar hight or more than 1 inside bar in a row) in the time frame where there are positive trades. like 0900 GMT and 1800GM ??? What makes this time more successful than others??

--- 帖子 #643 ---
The EA on the first page has been updated to included a parameter to set the MINIMUM IB size. Any IB's smaller that this value will not be traded with. Note that we are measuring the size of the Outer/Containing bar.

Can't see anything obvious. You are welcome to look at the attached CSV file and see if you can spot anything.

Today's results. First profit in a few weeks I think. Changed to use minimum IB size of 35 pips, but I'm not sure that this was the cause.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
1ka, First I want to say keep up the good work. The IB method is one that keeps intriguing me and your EA seems to be on the right track of improvement. Question: Can you comment on how you use the HourStart parameter? I am trying to use a demo account based on US EST time (-5 from GMT). How could I tell this in your EA? Suggestion: Do you think a filter of Min Max for the OB would be useful?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
The hours are calculated with respect to your PC's local time. So if you want to target 9am GMT, then set the hour start to (9-5)=4am. The second EA parameter determines for how long you want to trade, in hours. The min/max settings for the EA actually work on the Outer/Containing bar already

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I have been pretty successful since the addition of Min IB size. Since adding it on the 3rd I have missed several good trades but only had one bad one. One thing to be aware of is that the same setting do not work with different brokers and maybe not even with the same broker with different severs. I get better result with FXDD on some pairs than I do with IBFX. Other pairs seem to be just the opposite. The three pairs listed below are the ones that preform best for me when I look for a mix of parameters that work with both brokers.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Is it correct that when I do back test they seem to work off of broker time but in live trading work off of local time

--- 帖子 #657 ---
That's correct, I may change the EA at some point to work off broker/bar time. It would be less confusing.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
1ka, Thanks. In that case, also a filter for the internal IB might be interesting (since the OB filter seems to screen some bad ones). Also noticed that lower MaxIBSize gives interesting results (2000)

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Yes, I've since realised that MetaTrader can do alot of the manual work in working out what the best settings are for various parameters. If you use the "Optimization" option then MetaTrader will run back-to-back tests changing various parameters automatically. I'll run some tests over the weekend and see what optimizations pop out.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Another better day.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I have been trying to change the volume parameter to see what effect it would have on the EA but I get the same results no mater what I set it to. Should I see a point where if I raise it far enough trading should stop or at lease change the results?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hi Abnormalone, The volume parameter does affect trading. If the current volume is below the MinVolume, then it won't trade. Of course there could be a bug, but when I tested it with a volume of 600000 no trades were placed Note that on EURUSD M30 the volume range for the past few days has been between 170 and 3500!

--- 帖子 #663 ---
The volume parameter does work. My mistake for not setting it high enough. Does not seem to effect the profit much at least in the way I was hoping for.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Yes, on it's own it doesn't really do much. Now I've discovered the optimisation facility in MT4 then I might run some tests with all the 'options' enabled

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hey guys, if it's not too much trouble I was hoping somebody well versed with this EA could post their preferred settings line by line?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
If you have never used it before you will find that it only shows the good results unless you right click on Optimize results screen and click show useless results. It might save you some time if you look at post #655 and use the numbers I have as the center of your range for those 3 pairs and time frame. I also get much better results leaving Trailing stops at false on every pair I have tested at lower time frames. Be prepaired for some long run times if you select a lot of parameters to optimize at one time.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Setting will vary from one broker to another. The main settings I change for FXDD can be found at the top of the picture in post #655

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Thanks, I've already printed that pic so I can crib off of it. Can you also direct me to a post that describes what all the different settings mean exactly? I don't normally use EA's and I'm definitely not a programmer, so many of those settings are lost on me. But I'm willing to learn...

Hi, everyone, I just downloaded the ea and backtested it to the ideal settings on a 5M-basis. It seems to work well, but for some reason he just creates big losses from time to time...a bug?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
No bug, it's just that IB's are not guaranteed to always work. When they lose, they lose big time

--- 帖子 #671 ---
The first post is as good as it gets for settings and descriptions

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hi, 1ka, is there no way to restrict the losses? I mean as an option given in the properties settings. It might just be a nice try to test it...

--- 帖子 #673 ---
If I could do that then I'd be running this live and making a fortune.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Just be careful. Here is a quote from an expert: "When optimizing your EA, you should optimize as few parameters as possible. Optimizing too many parameters leads to curve-fitting , which produces great results in optimization, but performs poorly in real time trading." I might add (being a scientist:nerd:blush: that indeed curve fitting can direct you in the completely wrong direction. In science we say that with enough parameters you can do a curve fit an elephant... So I would suggest an optimization of the most critical parameters first and then keep those stable to optimize the less critical ones.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Read this carefully. If you want to have good results: 1. do not trade in a time frame less than 4H (only 4H and Daily). By doing this, you should know that every broker has its own local time and 4H/Daily bars look different in a different brokers. 2. Trade only the break of the Outside bar. 3. Eliminate small Outside bars (less than 0.9 average size). 4. Eliminate big Outside bars (more than 1.8 average size). You will have much less trades but many more success. Good luck.

There's an interesting technique being used in the thread here that describes a system for trading using Inside Bars on the 30M charts. ( Hmm, that thread just got deleted and all that good stuff is now in the bin. Shame on Forex Factory ). The owner of the thread would like to keep it 'pure', so this thread is a companion thread that takes the pure system and suggests improvements or alternative ways of working. Hopefully we can come up with a new system that enhances the current one. Everyone is welcome to discuss the IB technique. In particular, it would be interesting to hear what works, and doesn't work, for you. Ultimately, my personal goal is to create an EA that can work based upon the IB technique. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Can't you recover that stuff and post it here? Is this thread mainly for EA discussion? The DIBS works very well.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
The thread is in the bin here . Whilst I'm mainly interested in the EA, others have been discussing various trading options. You are welcome to post anything that you think is relevant.

I've updated the EA in Post 1 so that you can specify the hours you want to trade, by the hour. Use the attached spreadsheet to calculate the value for the required hour. I haven't tried the Spreadsheet in excel, but should work.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Cheers for the confirmation

--- 帖子 #683 ---
I must be brain dead today, I am not sure I understand spread sheet. If you want to trade from 6 GMT till 16 GMT do you put x in 6 and 16 or 6 and 10? Do you use broker time, GTM, or local time?

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi Abnormalone, You put an X in the hour you want to trade, so for 6 to 16, you would put X's in 6,7,8,9....16. If you only wanted to trade 6 and 16, you would put X's in only 6 and 16. Note that you need to delete the X's to remove them, not just put a space in it. I should have made it so that it actually checked the X, not just checked for a blank cell. Update -&gt; Changed the spreadsheet so that it checks for an 'X' or 'x'

--- 帖子 #685 ---

Your fantastic. I have looked at a lot of EA's and never seem one with the ability to turn time on and off this way. If I had an account with IBFX I think I would be tempted to go live today with results like this.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Thanks It seemed the obvious thing to do as certain hours seem to be more profitable than others.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I think that this is related to the 'genetic algorithm' setting where MT4 seems to 'home' in to certain settings. Turn this off and it runs through all combinations. It's easier to see patterns when doing it without the genetic algorithm stuff so you can stop and tweak to reduce the number of iterations.

Usually makes sense to trade the JPY pairs during the Asian session... http://i43.tinypic.com/kois0.gif

--- 帖子 #692 ---
I don't leave my PC on overnight that much, so there is a trading bias towards GMT 0700~2100. You can see this in the individual charts where the number of trades drops outside of these times.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
1ka: I see - so your Hour of Day charts are not really correct. So I might have drawn wrong conclusions.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Probably You can only use these as a 'guesstimate' of when to trade. You need to run your own simulations to see if there is any crossover. The choice of broker will affect you too. You've only got to look at the PipCop website to see how EA's are affected by brokers. Quite astonishing really. Bear in mind also that the profit/loss for each trade is affected by the settings I used for the IB at the time. Most of them are defaults, so shouldn't be too much of a problem.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Modified the EA to add a comment onto the screen to show what hours are being traded. Pick it up from the first post.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
1ka, Do you think a date function would be useful? For example, it might be interesting to avoid Fridays, Mondays, etc.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Yes it's a good idea. Unfortunately I'm using the Derby database and I can't get the weekday out of it using SQL. (not without writing my own user defined function). When I can do day-charts that are similar to the hour-charts then I'll attempt this.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
I think generally a trading system should have such option. In my base system I have a flexible way to avoid trading based on weekdays and hours. Not sure if such is possible with MT4. To give you some input: I have this 4 parameters (mainly use it to stop for weekends and restart on Monday after the spreads have normalised): This are my current Weekend Trading Block parameter: (DayNumber=0 - Monday) (DayNumber=4 - Friday) (hour - UTC time) StopDayNumber=4, StopHour=20, StartDayNumber=0, StartHour=1 so this means my Bots stop trading each Friday at 20:00 UTC and resume trading on Monday at 1:00 UTC.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Todays results. Monday's are missing as MetaTrader started up with a very old profile that ran some ancient EA's that lost $200 immediately. Anyone else get that problem with Metatrader?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
1ka, a) is the TrailTrends function operational? With my settings on the rest of the parameters I get exactly the same results with the TrailTrends true or false. b) For the time calculator, I was not sure if it is using my PC time or broker time.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Trail trends should be working. What happens is that when profit has been taken at 1/2 ATR then the SL is brought up to a BE point. When the price moves, the SL and TP are moved with it in an attempt to follow the trend. If the trend reverses, then SL/TP don't change. The setting for TPFactor affects where the initial TP is set (as a factor of ATR). If your TrailATRFactor is too low (below say 0.3) then it could be that minor price reversals are hitting the SL too early. The EA uses the Broker time. This is the time you see associated with the bars on your chart.

1ka, I know you have answered before but the results that you are showing are based on EURUSD or more pairs?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Many pairs on M30 since mid-Jan. Browse back a few pages and look at the charts, some show the currencies being used

--- 帖子 #707 ---
My back/forward testing on EUR/USD appears promising. I think Abnormalone a few posts back also showed a nice EUR/USD graph. Would it make sense to focus on this pair and see if the EA can go live , while testing the other pairs in demo?

--- 帖子 #708 ---
If I were to go live now my first choice would be E/U 30 min or U/J 30 min followed by E/U 60 min and U/J 60 min. This opinion is based on the least amount of Draw down using FXDD data. These also showed up best on IBFX but I learned late yesterday that my data was corrupted on IBFX and I will have to reload history somehow in order to fix the problem. The only other pairs I have tested are E/J and G/U and they both showed greater Drawdown and so far are preforming worst on forward test.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
abnormalone - thanks for the observations &amp; luckily for me those 2 have the lowest spreads w/ Oanda . will continue to demo to get to profitability. p

Good job! Preliminary testing shows that removing Tuesdays improves EURUSD

--- 帖子 #717 ---
I think the results of the EA are going to vary greatly depending on the broker you use. My test for trading hours show similar results to 1ka's when I use IBFX but if I transfer the same hour to FXDD and adjust for 3 hour time difference the results are unbelievably different. Just a small test on day of week using E/U and without changing any other inputs I show Mon Tue Thur being about equal on % profit trades. Wen and Fri are close to the same and about 6% better than the other 3 days.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Interesting... I am using FxPro by the way.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
My IBFX account was a dedicated tester till last week and I decided to let it go on line to forward test and when I did I had to update the program. Since updating I have not been able to optimize with it so I am trading 2 pairs using optimized results that were done before I updated and 2 pairs that were optimized on FXDD and just shifting the hours to match IBFX time to see what will happen. I am running the same 4 pair on 2 time frames on FXDD to see how the results match up.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I did some reading &amp; looking over old notes &amp; strategies this past weekend and on Candlesticker.com an IB (harami) has low reliability for reversal. An OB (engulfing) has medium reliability. I wonder how much chart watching &amp; EA effort should be devoted to low reliability? At the least perhaps one should consider only OBs. And I don't know how accurate or tested "candlesticker's" methodology was to determine "low" or "medium" reliability. Comments anyone?

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Thanks piprac. Interesting to know. The EA results I post here are all based on OB and generally run with default values. I think the currency based hourly charts are the most useful, as these can give you a good starting point for further optimisations. However Abnormalone's point on brokers is valid and the results I post for Alpari may not be the same as other brokers.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Hi piprac et al, hope you don't mind me chiming in here.... I trade ibs in conjunction with s&amp;r, momentum etc. I saw what you said "on Candlesticker.com an IB (harami) has low reliability for reversal" so the reverse would be true (they had a high reliability for trend continuance)? as that is basically how i trade them. I'm not sure this method would transfer to an ea very well? I wrote one (i'm not the best but i try lol) that used ma's to filter trend which worked nicely but most failed trades were due to the ib falling near (support/resistance) I didn't and still don't know of any ea that has the ability to interpret charts in this way.... kind regards

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I'm not sure if the reverse is true; "Candlesticker" gives 3 high reliability bullish patterns &amp; one bearish. There are also mediums &amp; lows shown too.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
i'm not familiar with "candlesticker" .... just had a look, it's all in the definition of IB's, "harami" "harami cross" "homeing pigeon" and "matching low" are all ib's but they study the price action within the bars context, where as I'd just look to see if the bar was within the previouse bars h/l (price action of the bar wouldn't have the same significance with ib's) so apples and oranges really. regards intresting site though

--- 帖子 #725 ---

--- 帖子 #726 ---
1ka, 1. How does the EA handle requotes? For example, if you are in a losing trade and it needs to SL but gets requotes. Will it keep trying to SL with the requoted price or leave your trade open (OUCH)? 2. Could you also comment on how Maxstart works with some numbers?

--- 帖子 #727 ---
The SL is set on the trade, the broker software should take care of this automatically and requotes shouldn't be a problem as we're not actually asking the server to SL dynamically. As for other things, open/close/modify, then the EA does not requote and we miss the trade. In theory the next tick should produce a new request. The MaxStart attempts to stop a trade opening if it has moved past the Outer Bar. So if MaxStart is 100 (10 pips with a 5 digit broker) then the price at which a trade is opened must be within 10 pips of the Outer Bar. It also avoid problems when we add the EA to a chart and it wants to open a trade straightaway - the price may have moved significantly past the OB point.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Thanks!

I might substitute some of the live results instead.

I'm contemplating changing the individual currency charts to show the daily/hourly breakdown as shown in the attached images. However, since the number of trades per hour is comparatively low, then statistically the results are a little meaningless. More useful or less useful?

1ka, I am playing with the EA on a demo for a while. It seems that an alert with the description "IA detected: Will trade short at X.XXXX EURUSD" or something similar will be useful in notifying us that a trade is coming. Again not necessary but useful....

--- 帖子 #737 ---
One more idea (weekend was very rejuvenating ....): What about a head-fake feature, i.e. a switch that would not trigger a trade the first time the OB is crossed but the second? It may save us some fake breakouts .

--- 帖子 #738 ---
I trade some IB's... But, the only direction i go is with the trend, I only trade during high volume, and I watch the tape. If you don't get particular on the IB's you take, then you are likely to get bashed in a tight range market. Daily IB's are the safest.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Thanks Takisd and kostas1 for the comments. I might try some of the higher timeframes at a later date. I know Abnormalone had some succcess with 4H+ (though my memory could be faulty ). I'm committed to 30M at the moment as I have a backlog of historical data to support that timeframe. I like the idea of taking the second, or subsequent, breakout. If I get time in the next few days I might try that to see what impact it has. I didn't bother with an alert feature. There are a number of indicators for IBs out there that already do this and I use them in conjunction with the IB. See here for an example.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
So far i have not been able to find any settings for higher timeframes that will repeat when I shift from one time period to another. My best success has been mostly 30 min. and 1 pair on 60 min.. When I optimize for 1/1/2009 thru 2/28/2009 I have found a few pair that I can then go back or forward in time and still get good results. I am forward testing E/U E/G E/J G/U as they seem to preform best on IBFX. Still working on FXDD but not getting good results so far.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Eur-Jpy. Outer bar must be before the inside bar. Trade 4H only . Buy when price breaks the high of the outer bar. Or Sell when price breaks the low of the outer bar. TP = 0.6 of the size of the outer bar. SL = on the other side of the outer bar. If we go Long, SL will be at the low of the OB and vice versa. Option: If SL hit, you may try to go immediately to the opposite trade with the same rules. Good luck.

1ka, You had any luck with this? The more I look into it the more I think it would help.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Hi kostas1 Been a bit busy lately, but will make some time for this in the next day or two. I'm not too sure how to implement it, either I ignore the first IB cross and take the next, or I ignore all IB crosses on a particular bar and wait for the cross on the next bar. As a first pass I think I'll do the latter one and wait for another bar.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
I was thinking the exact same thing! I wish I could help with coding but I'll stick with the ideas part for now. My EA would be profitable for the brokers...

--- 帖子 #749 ---
OK, this has been done. The EA on the first post has been updated. Set the parameter IgnoreFirstIBBreak to true to turn this on. By default it is off. The EA will ignore the first bar to break the IB when this is true. It has had limited testing, so let me know if anything looks wrong. Let me know how this compares.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hello 1K, I have been testing different IB strategies and attempting to incorporate them using your EA. Would it be possible for you to add an option to place the initial stop outside the outside bar (? number of pips), assuming one uses the "UseIBForBreakout" set to true? I am seeing numerious occasions where the IB bar is tested without breaking the OB. Thanks, Kirl

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Great job! Will let you know how my testing goes.....

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Initial back testing shows good improvement (06/2008-03/2009) with profit factors above 2.5 and profit trades above 75% . Before I was getting 1.7 and 65% respectively. Also Tuesdays became profitable whereas before they sucked.... In general it looks like a good improvement and I am putting it in demo forward testing. One question: Assume a MaxBar=7 and first break at bar=3 and next break at bar=5. Can the EA take the trade at other than the bar right next to the first break (or in this case it would take only a break at bar=4)

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Here is a screen shot where the IB was first broken on the 6th bar but order was filled on 8th bar.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Thanks Abnormalone, that answers kostas1 question perfectly I looked at your chart and wondered if it should have broken out on the 7th bar for a sell. However, perhaps it broke the bar but not if we include the BarOffset . A quick note on MaxStart . This is used when a new bar forms to check if there is an IB in the last MaxStart bars. Note that we don't count the newly formed bar so our IB could be one further left than we were expecting.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Folks, whilst working on another EA which is very time sensitive we have noticed that the switch to DST has caused a few problems. In the UK, Alpari use BST (GMT+1) all year around. Do other brokers do this? What this means is that if the best time to trade was at 9am then after DST it will be 10am, because everybody is trading an hour later according to 'real-world' times. God damned Alpari, why couldn't they just move times along with everyone else. I'd expect that the charts I produce will start to show a gradual shift of best trading times by an hour (that's if they are actually showing anything that is repeatable and not random).

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hi Kirl, The intial SL is set to the opposite side of the IB when a trade is opened. If I understand this correctly you would like to be able to add an additional 'x' pips to the SL so that it is larger and less likley to be hit? OK, I can add that to the mix. At some point I want to refactor some of the code in IBTrader. As part of an ongoing plan to code the 'best' EA I have come up with a library of routines for trading that simplify the logic for writing an EA and include things like trade retries. The IBTrader would benefit from this, especially retries as it currently doesn't do this.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
1. You're probably talking about MaxBars here (not MaxStart). 2. I am assuming that the EA uses BarOffset in both breaks, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
1. Correct, and thanks for pointing that out 2. Yes it does.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
For the sample I posted I increased Bar offset in order to create the situation we were looking for and bar 7 did not exceed that limit. While watching that run on other IB's I noticed that the new bar where the buy or sell is placed does not have to start or return inside the OB. It will execute an order if the new bar returns inside the limits set by I assume Max start and Bar offset and sometimes this is at a worst price than desired. On one run I had Max start still set at default and bar offset at 3 pips and was getting orders executed 8 or 9 pips out side the OB limits.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Thanks 1ka for your efforts and the rapid response! I understand the initial SL is set to the opposite side of the IB. What I am asking is an option to use the preceding OB to set stops. It appears the "BarOffset" is controlling the SL amount, with respect to the IB. And yes, I would like to be able to add or subtract an additional 'x' pips to the SL. I am working on the addition of custom indicators to the EA through your external source tool. However, I am having a bit of a problem having the EA recognize the indicator's signal. I hate to burden you, but can you give me an example, possibly with a screen shot of the Expert Properties window and/or set file to demonstrate the settings? Perhaps you could use a simple indicatior such as MACD or a moving average. Again, thank you for your efforts, Kirl

--- 帖子 #761 ---
This is an example of what I was trying to explain in post 759. Offset was at 8 pips Max Start was at 40 the OB top was 1.4490 and it executed a buy at 1.4510. Since I first saw this I have learned if you set Max start to a lower number it will not do this. In the example it did not mater anyway because it was a winner.

not yet. I am still working on improving it.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Well, we would be glad to test it. Could you explain the principles and how it is different from using 4h on 1ka's EA?

--- 帖子 #766 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...22#post2586622

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Nice smilee89. I see that the average win ratio is not much different to the results I achieve. What is different is that your average profit and average loss ratios are much the same - my average loss tends to be 5x the average profit, thus reducing the overall profitability. Is this purely down to trading 4H and restricting IB size, or is there something else to it?

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Very simple. In 4H you do not have much 'noises' as in 30 min. Also - I trade the break of the OB and not the break of the IB.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Hi Kirl, Let me see if I've understood you correctly. You are using the IBTrader-Ind extension to control when the EA should trade, yes? In here you are using a custom indicator and writing some logic to return true/false when it's a good time to trade, yes? If that is the case, then you need to use the iCustom method of MT4, something like this: double value = iCustom(Symbol(), Period(), "IND_NAME", IND_PARAM_1, IND_PARAM_2, ... IND_NUMBER, SHIFT); if ( value &gt; 10.0 ) trade=true; The MT4 help can give you more details on how this command should be used. Note that you don't need to have the indicator on the chart, it just needs to be on the experts\indicators directory.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
I think I need to trade 4H

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Good luck. Please post your interesting conclusions.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
For all you people who run MT4 on another computer full time, here is a potential useful program I wrote that monitors the connection between MT4 and the broker. In the event of any problems, it will try to email you so that you can have a look and fix it. See here for more details, and scroll down to the fourth post.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
I can get similar results with your EA. The big difference is in the number of trades. Smilee89 shows 219 trades for the same period that I can only get 28. I think part of this is due to Smilee making multiple entries on the same IB. On 4 hr time frame the profit loss ratio seem to equalize better. The problem is I do not think this will preform as well when you change to a time period that is not included in your optimized period.

It is true I divide each trade to 3 lots. Do not change to any other time period. Again: Trade only the 4h TimeFrame . Am I clear enough?

Further thoughts on this. Not all the world moves to DST at the same time, so trading patterns will vary whilst part of the world is using DST and the other not. e.g. when the US moves to DST Europe has not, so the US is perceived as opening an hour earlier and thus trading an hour earlier for an hour shorter. So, if you are trading specific hours you will have a transitional period where the hours you are trading could be wrong for the market you are trading in. Not sure how you get around this problem I'm currently running a 4 week back test each week to determine what the optimum trading parameters are, but am basing my trading times on the cumulative profit/loss since Jan 2009.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Have you tried the 4 hr time frame on any platforms beside FXDD? FXDD starts their 4 hr bar at GMT -2, IBFX starts their 4 hr bar at GMT -1 and it makes a huge difference in how they trade. On FXDD I can get several pairs to trade fairly well, GBP/JPY being the best. On IBFX I cannot get near the same performance

--- 帖子 #780 ---
It happens if you do not read my messages. I already wrote about the difference between the broker's time. Nobody replied my messages until I uploaded a graph and a statement that show that 4h is the best. I have also good results with Alpari which has different broker time. Interbank and other brokers that open trades on Sunday are much complicated but still, you can get good results if you make some adjustments to the system.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Here is a small example for IBFX

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Well, I would give for consideration: 1. Under normal circumstances should a good workable 'system' not be too much broker depended. 2. If possible very similar results across different pairs. At least that is what I would be looking for.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
When the price varies from one broker to another there is no way you can get the same performance. Check these two charts which should be the same.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
If you want to see how the broker affects the performance of an EA, then look at PipCop's site. He has the same EA's running across 9 brokers and all vary wildly. For instance, Evolution V is making $361 on the best performing one and -$115 on the worst. Go figure

you should upgrade your MT4 to v220 version at least

--- 帖子 #787 ---
hello dear $aly. thank's alot for your comment. but how can i find and download this version.(ofcoures my mean is which website)? thank's again.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hmm, you are the first person to report a crash with the EA. I can only think that, as $aly suggests, there is an issue with your older version of MT4. Build 223 is the latest one. You may be able to download it from your broker, alternatively download it from here . Note that you may need to set up your broker's server details and account again. Make a note of everything and backup the directory before you install the new one, just in case you need to back-out the update. There's also a potential issue that the broker will not talk to the new client, but I'm not sure about that.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
your broker is Fibo Group ...it 's mine too... follow up this link to download v223 version http://www.fibogroup.com/files/program/fg4setup.exe regards,

Cumulative trading charts. Last weeks charts are here . EURJPY and GBPJPY are the big losers overall. Note that 0900 GMT is still the best time to trade, but is not as profitiable as it once was. I think this is the issue we've talked about where the change to DST has caused a shift in the trading patterns. We'll see over the course of the next month or so.

Please feedback anything you find of interest

--- 帖子 #795 ---
1ka. You still fight the 30m TF. Why, for god's sake?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Smilee89, I don't want to answer for 1ka but why do you insist so much? My demo forward testing on 30m is not bad. My back-testing on 4hrs hasn't shown anything interesting (using 1ka's EA on FxPro ). If you have 4hrs parameters for 1ka's EA that we can test, post them up. Otherwise, when your EA is ready for testing we could try there...

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Because I don't want to give up on the 30M just yet. I'm the sort of trader who keeps pushing the SL back on a losing trade - that's why I prefer EA's Seriously though, if I move to 4H then there are a limited number of opportunities for me to trade. I don't leave my computer running all the time so, looking at Alpari UK, the 4H IBs that I could trade are at 0400, 0800, 1200 and possibly 1600. Not too bad, since these are peak London trading times, but I'd need to investigate whether these are the best times on 4H. Another reason was that I didn't want to lose the history of forward testing trades at 30M. But, since these are affected by DST change, to one degree or another, then I'm not sure that this data is worth as much as I thought. I might run a few back tests at 4H to see if I can get any better results. I recall that we've tried this in the past and not seen a great improvement. That said, 30M isn't so great either. === Does anyone use a ' netbook ' as a trading platform? These are the small form laptops that sell for around £300. I'm thinking of buying one of these and leaving it running 24H.

Back on the EA subject: I had given up on the stochastics or pivot point features but after you created the head-fake feature (thanks again for the quick response on that...) I revisited them. Combining the head-fake with pivot and/or stochastics I got 100% winners in one case (EURUSD 30m, Feb2009-April2009). The catch is that with this many filters I only got 8 trades for the 2-month period (still 100% winners )

--- 帖子 #801 ---
1ka, Quick question: For IB's inside IB's is the EA counting the first one and only after the MaxBars ends goes to the next one?

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Hi, yes, the EA will only look at most recent IB. I was thinking of changing this for the case where you have an IB within an IB and the smaller IB is too small (according to MinIBSize). Currently it does nothing, but perhaps it should go back to the enclosing IB.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Just to make it more clear then: I have a MinIBsize of 30 and the newly formed IB is 35 (i.e. valid). Then a new IB with size 25 forms inside my valid IB. Does this mean that the EA will ignore the first valid IB and focus on the second which is not valid and so it will do nothing?

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Yes - crap isn't it I'll change it, probably over the weekend if it's not too big a change.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Not any more New EA on first page. A simple change, but test it yourself before using. In computing the simplest change does the most damage

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Cudos on the quick change. My testing on EURUSD 30m shows that it picks up less than one additional trade per month and these additional trades are losers. If other people have different results (maybe other pairs) please post. My recommendation would be to go back to the previous version of EA for the sake of code simplicity:nerd:

--- 帖子 #808 ---
I only checked GBP/USD and it did not change to much so I changed everything over to run on new EA. Since you had bad results I will test more tonight. On GBP/USD total trades stayed the same, short side dropped one trade long side picked up one. Profit on total trades went up slightly.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
My results for EUR/USD show worst results too as far as % but was able to re optimize for better overall profit. Old Profit $201 Trades 107 Short 53(83.02%) Long 54(85.19%) Profit 90(84.11%) New Profit $194 Trades 113 Short 57(80.7%) Long 56(85.7%) Profit 94(83.19%) Re optimized ATR and TP on new EA and increased profit to $213 on same trades

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Some help here: Why didn't it take this trade ? IB: O 1.29314 H 1.29314 L 1.28981 C 1.29036 (EURUSD, 30m, 21/10/2009, 9:30am) MinIBsize 320, MaxStart 40, BarOffset 25 It was a good head-fake setup and I can't understand why the EA didn't initiate the trade...

--- 帖子 #811 ---
It may be the MaxStart figure. If the price jumps by more than 4 pips above the IB, then the trade will not be opened. You could increase this to, say 10 pips (MaxStart 100) but may run the risk of it opening a trade 10pips above the IB.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Good one. I backtested by increasing MaxStart to 50 and it picked those strange ones. All of the additional ones (4 for one month) winners.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
A MM option coded to set the lot size based on ATR would make things pretty interesting. I have noticed a high win % but the fact that IBs on higher TFs can range from 30 pips to 150 pips makes the losing one a major loser with fixed lot.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
I'm not sure quite how you envisage this working. If the ATR is high, do we have a smaller lot size, thus reducing the risk? Sorry if I seem dense

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Exactly. I've seen it coded elsewhere and could probarly fumble through adding it, so if I can do it I'm sure anyone can? haha.. maybe? anyway... yes you are right so that a 50 pip stop = 2% a 20 pip stop = 2% So basically as long as you have a winning % on, for example a 1:1 RR then you have profits. If you have a 60% winning rate with 2% risk you are sitting pretty. 50% = breakeven, etc.. I'm sure you get where I'm going. I've noticed about 55-70% winning rates on the EA so if MM was coded in then we are looking at a powerful tool. Edit: Also.. it would be nice to have it TP the entire lots at the TP factor if you have trail trends turned off. Right now even with it turned off it still splits the lots in half.. some TP at the TP the other half does... i have no idea with ts off and the trail trends off?

Yes, the split lot and trailing was a feature of the original IB thread (here). I kept the same trading method, but could now change this. As you noted, turning off trend trailing still splits at 1/2 ATR (or whatever you set.)

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Hi 1ka, I've been following this thread since the abandonment of the previous one and I truly believe in the Inside Bar strategy and the same problem is always going to be the filtering out most of the losing trades. Has the suggestion of using HVR (Historic Volitility Ratio) come up before? There's a system out there that combines IB trading and HVR that apparently increases the win rate. The HVR is basically a mathematical measuring of how much a price in a market has moved over a specified period of time. It’s the ratio or percent of a short to a long average historic volatility. When a markets short volatility declines below a certain percent of its long volatility it’s a heads up signal that an explosive move could be seen. I've come across the HVR indicator and did a bit of back testing and it appears that when the HVR value is below the 50% level as the system suggests, the better the chance of a triggered trade reaching the profit target and not straying too close to the stop loss. Is it possible to explore using this indicator instead of the stoch for example to filter the trades along with the ea?. Default settings are short period 6, long period 100 and average method 0 and values below 0.5 (50%) at the formation of the IB apparently gives us better trades. Would be interested to see the resulting numbers. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Me too! Interesting suggestion PipPig. I also found in my testing that if only we could filter a few bad ones it would dramatically improve the results. I have found many times that when I filter with both Stochastics and Pivot I get more than 95% wins (sometimes 100%) but the resulting trades are reduced a lot (3-4 per month in EURUSD 30m)

--- 帖子 #822 ---
PipPig Thanks for that, I hadn't come across this indicator before. I will see if I can integrate it into the EA using the extensions mechanism. That way it will be a good example for other people to refer to. My time is limited at the moment As Kostas1 noted, the IB method does seem to have potential, if only we could have a more consistent way of identifying losing trades

--- 帖子 #823 ---
I had a quick look at the indicator, the HVR value doesn't appear to be a percentage, just a 'number'. From my initial view, I'm not sure how to use it. At low values as you suggest, the trend appears to be flat, which would seem to indicate more risk of the IB failing. I would have thought that taking an IB when the HVR is above a certain threshold would be better?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
I see your point a1k but the way I read into the HVA was that when it went below the 0.5 or 50% mark, this indicated that volatility was at a level akin to the calm before the storm whereby any move thereafter would be like a breakout which would indicate a strong move. Here's the document attached I came across which explains it more. As IB is a price action strategy, combining it with lagging indicators such as stochs is not effective in my opinion but some kind of indication is needed to prune out the potentially bad trades, this just could be it

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Cheers, I'll have a read and see what I can do to integrate this.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Anybody around here?

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Only us chickens There's not much happening on the EA front, I'm rather busy at work at the moment, and run out of ideas for improving the EA. I'm about to move over to 4hr timeframes to see if the default EA performs any better.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Check the break of the outside bar in this TF.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Still a 30min believer here. Can you remind me the Stochastics filter? For example, in some backtesting I used StochOffset=60, is this Stoch(8,3,3) and what is the offset?

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hi smilee Could you remember the rules of entries and exits with outside bar and show some samples in TF4 ? Regards

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Read this: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=675 A break is when the price is 1 pip above the high of the outside bar or 1 pip below of the low of the outside bar. In the example you see an OB and IB after it. Each time the price breaks the high or the low of the OB - you open a trade. TP is divided to 2 or 3 targets. 1st TP is 0.6 of the size of OB. Than you move the SL of the other open trades to break even. 2nd TP is the same size of the OB. 3rd TP can run with Trailing stop or can be 1.6 of the OB.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Correct, the Stochastic option uses the 8,3,3 default setting (hmm, maybe I should parametrise this...). The 60 value is used to validate the buy and sell modes. i.e. You can only sell when (stoch value &gt; (100-StochOffset)) and buy when (stoch value &lt; StochOffset) . What we're trying to do is avoid buying or selling when we're at the wrong end of the stochastic indicator.

I have been using your EA on 4hr TF and doing pretty good as long as I close trades manually. When I optimize TPFactor and Trailtrends it seems as if it always sets Take Profit at an unrealistic high level that may get hit in a trending market but not in a choppy one. Smilee89's system for TP may be much better. I would post results but my computer crashed last week and I lost everything I had, even my Demo account.

He didn't go on to tell us the secret, at least not in his posts. But this document just might have that secret of his.... ...in fact, I'm going to post it again. I even put "A+" in the name, because when I save forex .pdfs I put A+ in the promising ones.... hi, i read the pdf,i can not find this indi HVR,i think IB combined with HVR is very accurate,isnt it?,is it possible to use NR4/IB on other TF as daily for instance 1H or 4H?

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I think the HVR (Historical Volatility) is the easy part -- Peter Crowns mentions that he always plays the "hot hand" -- the pair of currencies that moves the most after London opens at 0600 GMT. He always plays the biggest mover, whether it's gaining value or losing it. Naturally such currencies will have a history of volatility -- losing or gaining a hundred pips or more in a day on a regular basis. Also, the .pdf talks about checking daily bars, but PC and others play the hourly charts . If you check the "No Free Lunch" thread, you'll see plenty of attached charts on a one-hour time scale. I think the NR4 part was the key I've been looking for. I've played a few IBs and they generally produced mediocre to poor results -- now I think this qualifying NR4 rule will help me sort out the wheat from the chaff.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
HVR (or actually HRV) stands for Historical Record of Volatility , which means a record of being heavily traded on a regular (i.e., daily) basis. I suspect that any pair of majors will be fairly volatile. And I believe PC writes that he still plays the USD/CHF, USD/JPY, EUR/USD and GBP/USD , and I think we can all agree those are highly volatile.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
God DAMMIT , I hate it when that happens. From pg. 16 of the article: HOWEVER, the good news is, I don't think you need it. If you check a selection of PeterCrowns' posts, you'll find they are free of indicators -- just some SMAs in some of them. No stochastics, no bollinger bands, nothing. NO HVR. The most recent post His May 2, 2008 post (2 charts) A 210-pip short trade with 2 charts Another bare chart without indicators at the bottom A list of PC's posts: http://www.forexfactory.com/search.php?searchid=8138542 HVR might be the software that this company is trying to sell you so they can get your name on their mailing list.

Hi Sam What time frames are you using? Are you trading in the direction of the main trend? Dont limit yourself to just inside bars, use outside bars and gimme bars, think of the main trend and what you can use to pick up the reversal. I personally like inside bars, outside bars, gimme bars and the 1-2-3 setup, but I find them in the direction of the bigger time frame. Cheers Lino

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Hi Sam69 There are many ways to determine trend, I personally use bollinger bands SMA, if daily TF is trading above it, I would call it short term up. Then I would look for a bounce off the 4H or 1H bollinger bands. If you think of a daily chart going up, trading above the SMA, there is always a low of that day, hence you picking it up by using reversal bars. As for Gimme Bars, its from Joe Ross, trading naked, you can google it. Here is how I have my charts, these are only 3 pairs with 3 time frames. It has Bollinger Bands, 10EMA, and Tom Demark trendlines. Not just one approach to trading, one has to have an edge. Cheers Lino

Google brought me here... I was looking for an IB EA in mq4 (only to see how it was coded dif from my own and fix). IB's are useful- only until yesterday I always thought of them as ND bars (they aren't exactly the same but close enough for me)... and was having trouble trying to write in EA form- Maybe this pic will will help.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Ive just stumbled on this thread and it seems great. Have you guys considered having a much bigger TP and having the EA just shoot for trend changes from consolidation? Sounds like the EA could be easily capable of doing this, and if you think about it if RR is 1:12 or something along those lines, you could make a ton by just being right 25% of the time even.

I believe that the original thread got sent to the Recycle Bin. The originator got banned, he is now on another site. You might find the thread if you use the search and look for 'Hard 1 Head 1' Otherwise - 'inside bar' IBs are not difficult. You find one and use it as a range for a breakout. There are loads of indies on-line as well.

IB's seem to have their fair share of false breakouts which i dont like. I would like Nial Fuller if he reads ff anymore to address this..and he does in some of his videos, but its usually after the fact. usd-chf had 3 false breakouts on the 4hr charts. Nial says to buy the breaks and put stops below the "mother candle", but it seems waiting for the bar to close would be safer.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Insidebar means that bulls hasn't been strong enough to make new high or bears hasn't beeb stong enough to make new low. Gone nowhere. The next bar is importat, if the breakout happends then, its means of fast desision made by market, where it will go for a while. If the break of motherbar doesn't happend the next bar, then it means that markets hesitates. The bar after insidebar is importat. If it breaks up and closes over motherbars high, it means that the bullish resolution of the market was strong. Where the insidebar -frmation occurs, means added confluence for the future move. for example: -insidebar after severals bars strong move. Wait for the break up next bar -insidebar at support-level, wait for break either up or down next bar.

I like IBs , but I still need to put my head around them. For starters I've created a small indicator based on the rules Smilee89 explained in his previous posts. Here is an example:

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi All, I'm new to this forum (forex trading as well).I've an question about inside bar trading.I'dont my first question relevant this theard. See below example: 1.Candle 1 - Bull Candle Candle 2 - Inside Bar Candle 3 - Bear Candle Candle 4 - Bear Candle Candle 5 - Bull Candle So as a Trader based on above inside bar formation, I'm going to "buy stop" 10 pips above the candle 1 "High" value expecting a bull trend.But it does not execute beacuse then come bear trend(Candle 2 and 3). Candle 5 is a bull candle and it executes my "buy stop" order I already entered after observing "Inside bar". After going few pips in buy direction, there is good chance to come to sell direction and touch my SL. Are we going to cancel our "buy stop" order when we see bear candle? Or keep as it is? 2. I want to get the pip changes statistics after the inside bar formation.So please let me know how can I do that?Is there any indicator or EA for this? Are you talking about this in this thread?Please explain. eg: After the inside bar, there is is highest probability of going in to the same direction.I want to put TP and SL for my orders based on the statstics. thanks in advance (Apologize if my questions not relevant to this thread)

TBH, not even a single candle stick pattern does . So of course the question needs to be asks: So why bother trading then? Simplified answer: "everybody is a genius on a bull market" - Mark Cuban. Our job as a discretionary trader is just to identify an OBVIOUS trend in the market (could be a Daily Trend, Weekly Trend or even a Monthly Trend,, whichever suits your personality. I prefer Daily, because I'm a day trader, I find entries on the H1 chart and on some occasion, the H4 chart.) so what exactly is the purpose of Inside Bar? Sniper Entry &amp; Tight Stop. The notion surrounding successful traders is quite simple: CUT YOUR LOSSES SHORT (having a tight stop) AND LET YOUR WINNERS RUN (this is the holy grail.) having a tight stop meaning a relatively small Stop-Loss, and with an Inside Bar, you can approach this Stop-Loss objectively without using any magic Support/Resistance or Supply/Demand. You can definitely use Outside Bar. But it wouldn't be that cool would it? You get more R-R if you used a tight stop. You just need to bear the Losses. But the Winners will pay, and I promise you, it will pay-off!!!
