Short intro: No one can say I'm not determined. Have started several threads, met some great people... And boy have I learned a lot!!! Working like anything to develop an ea really brought home a lot of insight into what works and what doesn't. The ea is actually decent. But not quite good enough to actually put money into. Then researching other eas. Having a lot more understanding about what to look for and what to avoid. Found a couple very good, free, steady winners, passing 10 year backtests with flying colors, 80% win ratio. 120%/year. You know I have them attached to my account right now. But for this thread I want to present a very, very simple scalping strategy that I found while researching on the net. Lotta fun. The strategy is very sound. Have been trading demo with it recently with good results. The "lucky spike" is a good example of how to trade candle patterns. It's a simple pattern to spot. We will be using other candle patterns also along with an adx crossing indicator. Decent description of basic candlestick patterns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_pattern So here we go with the: "Lucky Spike". http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...dylDVv9FZ-WciR Bullish Signal 1. Strong downtrend. 2. Lucky Spike, Buy! 3. Place Stop Loss just below the Lucky Spike shadow. 4. Take profit on the next candlestick's close. http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/534/spikeh.png Bearish Signal 1. Strong uptrend. 2. Lucky Spike, Sell! 3. Place Stop Loss just above the Lucky Spike shadow. 4. Take profit on the next candlestick's close. http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/6117/spike2.png After a spike, there is often a longer candlestick – bullish after strong downtrend, or bearish after strong uptrend. Not every time, but it happens far more often than not. Whether the trend has reversed or not, trade just one candlestick for a few pips profit. That's easier and more effective than chasing the trend or watching how it is turning against you on the next candlestick. Can be used with the smallest time-frame as well as daily, weekly or even monthly time-frame. You trade no more than one candlestick. Enter on the open and exit on the close.

These are the demo trades so far pre London open. 5 min charts.

just took another short scalp USDCAD 5m

--- 帖子 #4 ---
thank you so much! i was looking for something like this! cheers!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
This is it...

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I use the sessions indi to show when the mkts open. There is usually a big move around that time. A good place for a spike...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
GBPUSD Very tight stop losses Just above the spike.. Missed take profit by 1 pip.. The only divergence was a macd divergence on the 1m. and that was pretty shallow...

--- 帖子 #8 ---
whats your actual method then ? entry / exit criteria etc ? and backtest results for the past year ? regards

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Just started using this. Looked so good I wanted to post so others could try it out too. This is manual scalping so I'm not sure how I would do a back test??? Check out the .pdf downloads. Self explanatory for how to....

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Got back into the GBPUSD short. Entered little too early before. Now divergence is clearly seen on the 5m. +7 pips. See how the proximity to market opens really makes the prices move..

--- 帖子 #11 ---
jivaaaaaaaa i'll be with you, gonna check this out this eve

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hey, hi. Never say, die.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
hi Jiva and all! do you people have some indi that can show the candle sticks patterns? jiva do you have the indi that shows the book? i left here some indis i have, if you people have another please share it! cheers!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Care to share the EA's you referred to in post 1? thank you

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Yes please jiva! A steady, conservative winner with a decent return is all some of us need to find happinness

--- 帖子 #16 ---
check out his last project... but no EAs for this strategy

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I've noticed that many of your spike bars do not qualify under the pdf definition. It says the body should make up no more that a third of the total candle range.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi jiva34, Is this system taking the place of "14.2 Inverse?" You have not been on that thread in a couple of days. pipsacker

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Yes, you're right. It will take some practice to get this right... Thanks. I like this kind of trading. I used to trade this set up a few years ago with pretty good success just using the indis, but I didn't pay enough attention to the candles. The candles make all the difference in the world. So I look forward to getting back to this with a new angle of vision.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Okay, here's the story. We really killed ourselves putting the Dragon ea together and then experimenting with the contra trade (the inverse). I think we went about as far we could go given our combined abilities. Which was a pretty good ways. I think it will take a lot more expertise to really put a successful ea together. Both trading knowledge and coding. Looking at some of the eas other traders have put together boggles my mind what they are able to do, with money management, and a million other safeguards and enhancements. So I'm giving ea building a rest. v14.2 inverse was the last gasp from the Dragon ea project. I see the basic idea is actually very good and I am also surprised (and not surprised at the same time) to see that other traders have also experimented with the inverse in their strategies with good measure of success. But it's time for me to give it a break. At somepoint I may get back to it. But for now, I like this "lucky spike" trade. I found some very good eas free and am very happy to just let them run on my account while I play with "lucky spike". Good Luck...

Hey great. I knew there were some out there and was going to do a search. You read my mind..

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Looks like you're getting the idea... Market timing makes all the difference in the world. If you get a candle pattern at a significant market time, like open or close or announcement or news you know it carries weight.... I don't think we need more than that, at least not for scalping... my preferred mode of trading.. .aside from ea's that do it all, all by themselves!! I tend to like to keep the chart as clean as possible. More doesn't seem to make it better, actually it seems to confuse things... Simple... I see no need for lagging indicators with "lucky spike".

[/QU OTE] im not a big fan of ea's i prefer manual trading to be more profitable and gives me a good adrenaline rush have u trade their ea?the one the system creator site is promoting? vsa works great with this,really nice template tooo

--- 帖子 #37 ---
[quote=dragan53;4237230] Not sure what you refer to for the ea? can you post a link, or pm me a link? I leave no stone unturned. Thanks.. There are eas that are super steady gainers that don't crash an account. The money management is very sophisticated with all sorts of safeguards. They really do exist. Yes I agree we have all we need really, with support and resistance, candle formations and market info. It's a winner. Just restrict trading to the specific times when the candle formation is backed by the market timing. It will have substance and momentum to it at those special market times and events. Small stop losses and very little drawdown, just off to the races!! I'm not looking to stay in a trade for any length of time. Just get me 5, 10 or 20 pips at each event and I am happy, oh so happy. The prices can sky rocket if they want to without me, I've reached my goal, according to the strategy. That's plenty good enough for me. Just wait until the next market event and do it again. 40, 50 pips/day, good bye time clock..... I'm on market time now!!!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
[quote=jiva34;4237301] im sure u can get more,up to a hundred i guess,buy on support and sell at resistance,if it doesnt bounce just keep the position thats the way i see it wats ur best tf,i use 1h?

Jiva notice how the zz nrp picks the long wick candles, it can also keep U in longer term trades by checking whether its painted in higher TF,s

--- 帖子 #43 ---
EA would be awesome, but i do also prefer manual trading. But this candlestick pattern thing is just amazing. i do really love those patterns, they symbolize the price action and are easy to read.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I agree... Been trading a long time but it seems only just now the value of the candlestick patterns is really hitting home. Have been lagging indicator addicted...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Will do. give me a little time. Welcome aboard..

--- 帖子 #55 ---
No worries

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I knew there was a second half to the event, that ppi was just the first installment, and Bean was the 2nd half but went ahead anyway. Also candle was closed below s1.. although it had a tail... can learn from mistakes... I'm learning a lot!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
jiva in prison , haha

--- 帖子 #65 ---
my target is 40pips usdjpy,and abou 100 on eur,or watever i can get

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Looks good. I wouldn't trade against that, let's put it that way. 1hr USDJPY has good candle pattern short... above the daily pivot EURUSD on a healthy bounce.. good luck..

--- 帖子 #67 ---
do u really play for a 100 pip target on eu long? ouch... what R:R are u using at such targets? remember the 84.00 support price at uj crossing ur way to the target

--- 帖子 #68 ---

--- 帖子 #77 ---
i think im gonna regreat the eur usd sell off,o well

--- 帖子 #78 ---
yep u heard right

--- 帖子 #79 ---
okay.usually this isn't bad, but u need at minimum 2 out of 3 trades in profit to be BE. so think about more profitable r:r in future, all equal or above 1:1 ( 1:1&lt;) is actually good. u should be above 50:50.

the high stop loss strategy i was thought by a trader who used to make $40 000 a week ,and always used to come 1st in etoro challenge,but now hes stopped being a money machine,i dont know what happened to him,now he doesnt make any good trades anymore ,hes going against his strategy that hes said in his interview,he takes 400x leverage....in the interview he mentioned taking 50 leverage,but thats a lesson for us to learn,dont break the rule! http://www.etoro.net/traders-insight...fit-14283.html have a look at his job,quality risk manager,what more do u need in forex than that,and now thats a trading personality

--- 帖子 #88 ---
whats more impresive is that my profit coudlve been 100 pips now not 50,but me braking my rules,took only 50

--- 帖子 #89 ---
hey jiva thanks for follow on etoro ,did u just make the account? wouu how cool im coming 10th in the weekly challlenge,yeaaa http://openbook.etoro.com/Rankings/

--- 帖子 #90 ---
why is the euro having such a rally ?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Sometimes just lucky... Learned a lot on that one.. be careful to observe support and resistance, always! make sure the event doesn't have more than one installment. Keep the stop in place and don't jump out because it looks like....... stay with the strategy... why I entered, why the stop is where it is, why the limit is where it is...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Now let's see what other mischief I can get into. NY opens momentarily...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
The psychology cannot be ignored. Sometimes being success is too much to maintain. Like a criminal who gets out of prison and doesn't know what to do with their freedom. Back into prison they go. They know how to deal will prison life. So being successful and having more than enough money is bewildering to some people, they don't know what to do in that situation. So they end up back in debt again. That is something they are very familiar with. I am certain this has much to do with why traders lose. Not just how good are the technicals of a strategy. But what to do with success? The psychology of winning.

r2 in audusd,anyone wanna have a guess,if its gonna bounce back or go through? i reckon through until next week with bounces ,the move wasnt done by huge volume as the volume indi says,but who knows in the forex the volume isnt calculated fully as im writing this its already breaking, http://img146.imageshack.us/img146/3861/chstty278.gif

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Should have checked the thread... got AUDUSD all wrong... The strategy is still new to me too. the strategy clearly pointed to long as the open of NY, but I guess I was stuck in a time warp or something, and looked at the 3 candles earlier and saw a pullback below resistance. But market open showed a continuation to the upside.. Got burned. Made a few back on USDCHF...

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Huge moves today. Traders who got it right made zillions. Someday. There I stood with my +12.4 pips.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Your pips are consistent. I wonder if the ones who get the big moves can say the same. Nice scalping method! I think I will try it. Thanks jiva!

Thanks, bud for the thumbs up. I'm just trying to stay with a strategy, no matter what else happens in the market. The strategy doesn't tap into big moves, up or down.. So yes, consistent is the goal...

Hi jiva and friends! I live in Mexico so it's difficult for me to trade when uk opens, and only I can trade during Asia and US session. Do you think that I strongly need to trade uk session or I can still have good trades in Asia and us sessions? Thank you and have a good one!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
UK session is the biggest. London forex exchange is the most active. US is next in size and activity and then Tokyo. Lot of traders do very well with just the Asian session. Or just the US session. Some traders only trade once a day and make a good profit. Everyone is different. My schedule allows me full access to all the markets. I don't know if that's good or bad, if you know what I mean, , since this can be addictive....

--- 帖子 #109 ---
We'll be watching.. Good luck. I'll just be doing my spike thing, looking for the set up at significant market events and market openings and closings.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
The candle pattern should also be in the direction of the trend. A good way to catch part of the rebound. so we are adding macd for trend confirmation. and also will be watching other candle formations using the pattern master indi. A nice spike on this chart but it is not inn the direction of the trend so we would not try to trade it. The second chart shows why... We wait for a bullish formation in an uptrend. And a bearish formation in a downtrend. Keep an eye on market times and news events they give momentum.

Hi there, I was just wondering what the idea or principal (perhaps psychological) behind the lucky spike is? Is it something like market is overextending upwards and you see the lucky spike, then you short it for a couple of pips without caring in which direction the trend continues?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
There's at least a couple of things that could make the spike. As I'm seeing it,: 1. The last gasp of exuberance before a move is OB or OS. Then it pulls back cause there are no more buys/ sellers at that time to push the move on. Then when the traders realize the momentum is through, they start to get out of the trade and that accelerates the pullback. 2. or an out and out reversal is setting in for a major change in direction, OB or OS on a higher time frame. There are probably other ways to see it but that makes sense to me. That's why to wait for the trend and trade with it will usually give the best results, catching a pullback as it turns around to resume. Only thing is sometimes it may be a bad trade because it's not a pullback resuming it's a trend reversal. At that point it can be very difficult to tell the difference. Hence: stop losses.

So what should I do? I'm not even trading candlesticks at all. I'm using Heineken ashi and double/osma. with a trailing stop indi.. yikes.. Here's the template and the activity, plus a couple trades on my live account, not shown. I ought to be shot...

eurusd s1 BIS sells USD/JPY Written by Gerry Davies December 15, 2010 at 10:48 GMT We’re at 84.05 presently. Also earlier heard talk of hedge fund sell orders lined up around 84.15. so if euro goes up again,and usdjpy falls,that would be vvery sweet

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Looks like USDJPY is more or less consolidation on Day Depends on how big a move you are looking for. Looks range bound..

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I'm just not happy with my trading strategy, again.. But I'm working on something that has a lot of promise. Back to candles. I apologize for the back and forth. But it happens. Trying to get it right. Still shorting EURUSD. Scalping, 5m. In and out, in and out.

--- 帖子 #155 ---

This may be the scalpers dream come true set up... anyway this is what I'll be using maybe for quite some time. It's nice.... It's an adx crossing indi.. the red or blue dots... with a trailing stop indi, wood pivots and candles... yeah..

--- 帖子 #162 ---
A trailing stop method you might consider. The idea is that you count back three bars and place a stop at the bottom of the lowest of the three bars if long (top of highest of the three bars if short). The trick is that when you are counting the bars you do not count the bars that are "inside bars" (an inside bar is any bar that is equal to or engulfed by the previous bar). See the illustration below.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Interesting, thanks... Know of an indi that will flag this? http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/1769/3bar.jpg

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I really like this set up.... I have EURUSD and GBPUSD charts for all the time frames set up with the candle template. when adx cosses on any of them the alert sounds. The alert sounded and there was a popup - adx crossing up on GBPUSD 5min. And there it was the candle formation on the 30 min, confirmed by the adx cross up on the 5 min... got it: +3

--- 帖子 #165 ---
No I have not seen one. This method is not new though so maybe one is out there.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
This will show pin bars and other price action and you can set it to alert you to what time frame it is on. Set all the time frames to true and it will pop up alert with message. Not sure but it might be of use here also.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
well,u can try to find that out yourself, from what i see,when it boundes from one o those lines the rbci indi it goes the other direction ,when it goes trhu it goes to that direction that its going now,im trying to figure out more about ,hoepfully my friend john last can tell us from optimized trend thread

--- 帖子 #170 ---
buy at growth ,sell at decline also(buy low stochastic red and sell high stoch green)adn its has to cross growth is hma blue,and rbci going thru the opposite for sell :::it is simply vsa digital:::

Not avoiding everyone, just been diving deep.. Great scalping strategy!! Was playing with some ea's and opened the code. could see what the strategy was. the ea stinks... But the strategy is great. Sometimes that happens, automation is difficult.. I call it the bounce. Since it is very fast on the 1m, candle formations don't enter into it to much, although a really obvious formation should not be overlooked... When candle closes outside the bb bands (10,2) take a trade opposite. So above bb, sell, below bb, buy.. Don't take more than a 4 pip loss. Look for 5 to 10 pips or more... Just getting started with this... There's lots going on with the thread, sorry if it goes a lot of different places, but I'm okay with it... Lots of good stuff here. Serious traders trying like anything to get it to work the best we can.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
+2, +3 Don't see why this wouldn't work on any time frame.... Just use very tight stops....

--- 帖子 #174 ---
u need tight spreads for this,

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Tight spreads would help, that's for sure. I'm trading FXDD fixed spread EURUSD 2 pips I want to put some time into researching higher time frames. The ea we were working on used a breach of hi lo channel. The problem we ran into was what the best value of the channel was. Since it was based on a moving average that moving average tended to change with market conditions. But using bb set at 10 may be a better choice. I want to look at the 1 hour...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
So far so good. If this works so nicely on 1m why not 15m or hourly?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
What's great about this is it can be traded anytime. It's just a simple reflex bounce out of 1m overbought or oversold conditions... News shmews, Friday, Sunday, Holidays... who cares... This is trading on the cellular level.... nano... nuclear energy...

--- 帖子 #178 ---
The more I work with this design the more it makes sense. Just like with indis (only better because this is pure price action!!!) the candles can been on different time frames. the move in the chart showed the same candle formation on 3 time frames. 1m, 5m, and 15 min. so it was a nice move... First full day trading this. Results are good. One loss was a technical error I clicked to buy when it I should have sold. The other error I just didn't play it right... let the loser run... I can see something like this with lot size=%balance.....

--- 帖子 #179 ---

nice bounce off resistance The signal was actually on the 30m. The lucky spike formation (It's r2, not r1, sorry bout that)

--- 帖子 #187 ---
swing trade, another bounce off resistance with a similar formation.. a close outside bb, plus a spike off of resistance....

ouh,got out of usdjpy with 5pips yesterday i was down 70

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Nice little trick to save a possible losing trade. Entry a little early, enter again further on in the move, and then again. for net gain...

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Working on all aspects of making this a successful strategy. Haven't got to money management yet, but it will lend itself well to lot size as %of balance. The signals are good. candles in relationship to bb bands. Around the wood pivots and wood S&amp;R sell on close high, buy on close low. Look for candle formations to confirm, spikes, or haramis, engulfings etc. Look for 5 pips. When prices move away from the pivot or S&amp;R, look to buy on close hi and sell on close low. Target will be the next area of support or resistance. 50 or 100 pips possible.. Trial run on tester forward... London session.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
That's it for a while. Thank goodness it's the weekend. We have a plan for Monday.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
hey thanks for worrying,, lol ive decided to only trade eurusd since all the other currencies get affected by eurusd ,i dont see a point trading usdjpy,if its gonna be affected by eurusd,

--- 帖子 #194 ---
My sentiments exactly. EURUSD it is. It's the most heavily traded pair anyway. And spreads are usually less than the others. A lot of pieces of the puzzle are coming together. How to trade around support and resistance. How to watch for market times for big moves. How to catch the trend. How to check multi time frame confirmation. The significance of candle formations in relationship to standard deviation using bollinger bands with a customized setting. The lack of necessity for using lagging indicators, and even their counter productivity. The benefit of compounding. The benefit of keeping tight stops and honoring them. We will put it all together next week. Looking forward to it.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
cool ,we can trade together,hows the bounce strategy hows?how many pips?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
During consolidations which are looked for around wood pivot and s and r, 5 pips is great. After all this is the 1 min chart and prices are more or less bobbing up and down in a very tight range as traders are repositioning. When the move becomes clear either up or down and we leave consolidation the target is the next area of support or resistance. For example if we leave the pivot and head up, the r1 is the target however many pips that is, 40, 50 ?? varies. Then we look for consolidation here, but it might not be much if it is a strong move, we just might blast through and head for r2.. In that case we get back in target r2. Like that. So if we watch the candles forming in relationship to the bb bands we can get our entries according to trending or consolidations conditions. In consolidation enter short with a close outside up, and enter long with a close outside down. Just the opposite once we start to head away from the consolidation. I've worked enough with this to know this is good. this is a sound strategy. Now how to recognize the entries and remain disciplined. Practically speaking we built an ea to trade this, but we were using a hi lo channel instead of bb bands and we did not have a candle recognition function. We kept adding indicators, macd, cci, stoch, moving averages etc to try to refine the entries but none of them were able to do the job. BB bands and candle recognition are all that is needed. They are very precise and based on price action. Traders love indicators, but they are lagging. They cannot identify an entry quick enough. But candles showing price action are right there when it is happening. I'm really excited about this. So let's see what happens next week. Look forward to trading with you...

I was deciphering a scalping ea I found on the forums. Just curious. I could see from the code. I remembered reading Bollinger's book where he discussed using different settings for deviation for different time frames.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Reply to my own post, just a note: I don't believe for a moment that this is all there is to it, but it is another step in the right direction.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Interesting. 80,2 on 15 min chart.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
are the x signals repainting?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Bollinger applies the bands tp the indicators also instead of fixed os and ob, he uses the bands. So for rsi, bb bands say 20,2 the usual, and rsi would be over bought when the upper bands were breached, and over sold when the lower bands were breached. That may or may not correspond to 70 and 30. He felt this was more accurate way to determine overbought and oversold.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Yes the Super signal does repaint but it has to. The other arrow is flexi bar swing and it does not repaint. I am just playing around and testing them out. Flexi bar swing seems to confirm the super signal sometimes.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
i dont like repainting signals they made me loose money i of them

nice scalp off a lucky spike going into close of Asian session.. The spike was on the 15m chart..

Staying with just one pair, EURUSD, flat all morning pretty much and then a quick drop just before London mkts closed.

jiva have u thought about trading fibonacci bounces ,from fibo fans and retracements

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I want to take a look at that. Makes sense. The wood pivots are so "in your face" obvious I kinda tend toward using them... Here, after the news there was a dramatic drop. I was certain they were headed for the limit and stop orders at the wood pivot so I loaded up with as many sell orders as I could for some good scalps...

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Where is the mad Russian scientist? Where do we go from here? Any idea... Got it right.. didn't trade it though, except for an iddy biddy scalp. Interesting that the fib time sequence was right on the move up... Also it was the 3rd touch of support which I've heard discussed can be significant bounce off support...

--- 帖子 #226 ---
i have no idea,looks like another bounce on 61.8 ,im in eurusd buy position since monday i changed my trading method to the one i started with 3 years ago,shorting tops and getting on support,well of course ididnt use rs before,but i did trade like that at the beggining and i think i found my methodology ,i only wish i could get into penny stocks and trade with timmay,but as i have many curency pairs on my mt4 demo,and not many on my real account on etoro,well ill have less options to pick good stuff,on my old trading trading phylosophy,adopting the market because its one big jungle http://www.naturalselectionanddarwin...darwinism.html this is a good physchology because every currency pair has diferent personalities, and that one of the reasons i make those vids to make me remember,because i usually forget stuff

--- 帖子 #236 ---
-30 pips , Just a fluke whipsaw. Some announcement by someone somewhere that moved the market momentarily. (I remember, it was China news about a billion dollar something or other). ALWAYS USE STOPS NO MATTER WHAT... Dragon ea: It's so nicely coded runs smooth and fast. Does not eat up cpu like some others I have tried to run. It has possibilities even in its present form. I am still experimenting with it. It has an inverse version also. Opens on a close outside a hi lo channel the value of which can be set. a million indicators and moving averages on all time frames as options. Everything is optional except for the channel. Great stop loss system for locking in gains as well as limiting losses. Times for trading can be set. I'll attach them. By the way the ea at CBBP is awesome. Thanks for the link. How many 1m trades/day. A lot... I have to be careful not to overtrade. That's a big trap and sure formula for losses. I have other work I am doing on the computer so I just keep an eye out for opportunities making sure I don't fall into the trap of staring a hole through the monitor.

EURUSD 5min Okay trade is in, time to go do something else. Watched pot never boils.. okay time to come back and see what happened. voila!! cbbp in reverse does it again #6 wins in a row....

yes, I see. the thing I like about cppb in reverse is that the 10 year back test is terrific. 75% loss... with stop 19 tp 30 on a 5 min chart. Pretty hard to curve fit a 10 year back test on a 5 min time frame, if you know what I mean... I'm in the testing stage right now. although I am taking trades in micro as well a some demos. I am taking the signals manually so I can wait for a better entry if I want, as well as set up with a service that places the inverse automatically in a third account. But I know what I am looking for. 2 trades like that per day, 2 hours after London open and 1 hour after NY open. And I'm done. Possible 30 or 40 pips/day. Indicator based strategies are slow. Because indis are lagging indicators. Traders love the indis, with their wavy lines and colorful bars and stripes, but they are slow. Price action is right there when it is happening. Candles, trend lines. bb bands, like that.. The influence of market times cannot be overestimated. with this cbbp ea there are no indis that I know of. It is simply price action at a specific time in the market. Up go long, down go short..if prices moves 5 pips in 5 minutes in that direction. Consistent results for 10 years.................... If this holds, I don't need anything else....

70% loss?isnt that more loosing than winning, can i see the 10 year backtest how do u set up 10 year backtests,i have trouble with those on my mt4

--- 帖子 #290 ---
yes it is more losing than winning, but that's the idea, if I'm taking the opposite, so then 70% losing becomes 70% winning.... it's na modeling quality, but it's the 5 min chart for 10 years. We can at least get the idea.... I mean this is a small stop loss, 30 pips... some eas use 150 pip stops with 15 pip tp and get straight lines until the stop gets hit and wipes out a year's worth of gains... 2 stops getting hit and the account is in the red.. Think inverse....

--- 帖子 #291 ---
hahahhah,jiva ,i never seen that one before,so i think its better for u to get a ea that looses more,even better

--- 帖子 #292 ---
we should create an ea that does exactly the opposite,get a real bad ea,when it buy SELL! HEHE SMART JIVA!

It takes a little getting used to. Because it is not a mirror image inverse, the spread makes things skewed. When it trades inverse the spread now widens and the stops and limits are also skewed. I have it figured out.. More or less.. The difference for profit will be 2 x the spread in difference. In other words, if the stop is reached for a loss of 19 pips in the original account, the losing account, then the inverse account will see a gain of 19 - 2 x the spread.... For fxdd, EURUSD is 2 pips, so it will now be a difference of 4 pips..... 19 loss means 15 gain.. And the market is moving too so that can shift even more for or against....But roughly....

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I see they have discussed many of the issues in a few posts. The only thing is I have the ea and the practical results. the spread is accounted for the ea trades no more than 2 times per day. the losses are big enough to show significant profit in reverse. And it is consistent. It is not theoretical. I am trading this for last week... 6 wins for the inverse... spread accounted for, +15 pips each (plus a few more since the market was moving too)

Yes I know what you mean about the sleep problem. I think it is too much stimulation just before nap time. Take a walk. Or do something else for a little while. The charts and the forex thing will all be there. It's not going anywhere. You're not going to solve it within the next 15 minutes. It's going to take years. Relax., Actually when I take a break sometimes things fall into place. Like all the stuff I'm being exposed to seems to come together a bit when I back off. There is an addictive quality to this. We love to find answers to things, and we are always feeling like we are finding answers. New techniques etc. So it's quite addictive.

Not the best entries. It's alot to put together. Watch candles, get the eye for the formations, 3 down, 3 up, stars, hammers, spikes, engulfings, haramis etc. Watch market times. Just before the hour many times there is some momentum to a move, about 20 minutes before the hour. Just before Frankfurt open, just before London open, and a little after London open signals around these times stand a better chance of being good. Look at the set up, know how many pips you want to take. If the set up doesn't look like it can get the pips don't enter just because a candle formation looks good. Lots to consider. Where will the stop be? There has to be a stop!!!! At what point once the trade is in progress would it be fair to say it I got it wrong and exit? If it dips below support? If it breaks above resistance? By how much? All this should be thought out before entering a trade. Medians for the pivots are significant areas. the 200 ema is significant. Lots to consider. upper time frames. How do they look? Lots...

on the 4hr there is a spike developing, still 19 mins left for the candle to close but there is also a negative divergence in obv, could be the end of the run up in EURUSD. End of year repositioning. Am short here. 30 pip stop prices like to come back and test old resistance. yellow trend line.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
moral of the story always wait for a candle to close before concluding. And of course I didn't do any of the things I listed a few posts back. Stopped out. However the inverse ea has given a signal. So back in we go. It may be a loser too, since after 6 winners in a row to look for #7? We shall see. The ea doesn't use any indicators. if prices move 5 pips within 5 min at open of candle 2 hours after London open, place order in opposite direction. Stop 30 tp 15.. Ordinarily I wouldn't go long here, but we are trading mechanically according to ea's signals... looks like the bot has put tp at resistance and stop at support. smart ea, eh? what do I know, I would not have gone long here, but bot in reverse says go long... I'm with bot. 7 winners in a row...

--- 帖子 #325 ---
look bullish,cci trend is up on 4h for me,and the daily candle is also good,i think we might see a erubull ,or maybe its just central bank buying,spanish central bank has been a buyer of euro news This time they were buying the USD. The BIS were seen buying USD/JPY below 81.50 and there was also some rumoured sightings of Kampo (semi-official buying on behalf of BOJ). There were also central banks seen selling EUR/USD at 1.3310 (probably booking profits on those they bought earlier in the week at 1.3085).

hmmm. that could be a very very simple trading technique all by itself.. look for an entry so that stop is above resistance and limit is at support for short and vice versa for long. Just that nothing else... well you know what I will be fiddling with for the next little while... Boy that would really help to control risk, look for entries where stop is very small... according to that criteria...

I agree pretty much. But lower time frames can be traded... but for entries, the higher time frames need to be consulted..

--- 帖子 #338 ---
the ea looks for trades 2 times/day. 2 hours after London open and 1 hour after NY open. So it will probably take another trade today in about 30 mins. I'll be taking the inverse. going for 8 wins in a row with a 30 pip stop loss, tp 15. 10 yr backtest 70% loss (which means 70% win inverse) So we are getting close to testing the mean. Which means 7 out of 10 trades can expected to be losses. So it is highly probable that the next 3 trades or so will be losses. No trade 1 hr after NY open, prices did not move 5 pips in any one direction within 5 mins...

Taking a closer look at the backtest the loss rate for 1 year is 90% and for 10yr is 84%. So the bot is profitable in inverse. The way it translates for taking the opposite trade is: (Using fxdd with fixed spreads of 2 pips for EURUSD) for bot: stop=19 limit = 30 the inverse trade: limit =15 stop =34 It is because of the spread that there is a skew. The inverse trade rr changes so the inverse trade has more to lose and less to gain, but because there is such a high success rate in inverse it is still profitable. for inverse: using the 1 yr backtest data at 90%: 9 x 15 = +135 1 x 34 = -34 total = +101 average gain for each 10 trades. for inverse: using 10 yr backtest data at 84%: 8.4 x 15 = +126 1.6 x 34 = -54 total = +72 average gain for each 10 trades. So we are inclined to keep the bot running and take the inverse trades.... If this holds we may have finally gotten 1+1 to equal 2.... Then we could consider compounding gains.. BTW this bot uses no indis whatsoever... It is market time and price action based only and usually takes 2 trades per day...

Eager beaver martingale keeps taking on more and more positions in such a way as to try to get net gain when the losing streak stops, unfortunately the positions need to increase in size at an accelerated rate in order to show net gain when the market finally turns in the trader's favor, if there are more than 4 or 5 losses in a row the amount of losing open positions has increased to a size more than an account can tolerate and the margin call comes. And there is no guarantee that there will not be 6 or even 7 losing trades in a row... No one that I know of has been able to trade martingale successfully.

tinkering with the costa hedge ea. It does have a big plus going for it even though it is a type of martingale hedge. It has stop loss for net for all open positions which appears to be a trailing stop. So locks in gains. I'll have to look at the code a bit more. It may just be the tester locking up after a big drop. What I have been testing in the tester is when it stops out and closes all positions. Starting it up again on the next day. the results are very good for the last year. fxdd EURUSD $10000 to start using .01 lots... It stopped out 16 times. 11 times were locking profit totaling = +$24483 5 times were limiting losses totaling = -$10783 total for the year of a gain = +$13,700... 69% success rate... average win $2226 average loss $2157 graphs show biggest winner and biggest loser link to the ea: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=171034
