Hello fellow traders, I have a system which use the 100 and 200 moving averages, and the 10 and the 5 moving averages all simple. We will also employ the adx to determine strength. I did not want to start this thread but I am curious as to what my fellow traders think. This is a simple cross over system and i have found some success with it but on the daily time frame. (not enough trades) For a buy (2 types of entry's) We need a cross of the 5 above the 10 we also need the 100 to be above the 200. 2nd type of entry we need 5 above the 10 and we also need the 100 to be pointing upwards. ADX has to be strong and above 25 For a sell we need the opposite There are times when I will break these rules, but there will be an explanation, I have been trading for about 6 years mostly stocks now. The forex market has been very unpredictable and very hard for me to trade. Ive tried most popular systems on the factory and they didn't work for me. This appears to be consistent in making pips. Please tell me what you think, i don't mind critics, we are all here to make money. I almost forgot, your stoploss should be above or below recent high. Charts to follow. I HATE TYPING Thanks

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Perfect buy entry on the vertical line. I dont like posting charts after the fact but just to give you an idea of what I am talking about.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Its great to catch when MA's cross at the same time, but alot of times it does not happen.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Rule breaker trade (100 and 200) are very close and we have a strong adx

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Selling opportunity. Notice the slope of the 100 MA Strong ADX

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I forgot to mention this system is on Baby P but I found it to be too vague, I added the 100 and 200 MA's with the ADX to suite my style. WHERE ARE THE CRITICS, Lets Go

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I will try to post as many live trades as possible and I hope you guys do the same. I like to see buy and sell lines on charts

--- 帖子 #8 ---
You have found a holy grail, 100 + 200 SMA is thebest MA cross there is. Even better on daily but very long term.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I don't know about that, but we will see. The daily just didn't produce enough trades for me. Its very long term. For the hour chart I will start looking for trades at 3:am NY time up untill about 11:am. If I see something juicy during the Asian session I may jump on it, but not likely.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I will take trades close to news time, it doesn't scare me, but I will have aggressive stops in place, you can always get back in.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I forgot to mention, big long candles at the cross, i do not trade because there is going to be a pull back , usually. But then again I will break that rule if the 100 and 200 are crossing at the same time as the 5 and 10 are. That is the only time. Edit: If its a strong move and the adx remains above 25, I may use a pending order above or below long candles.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Whats not known is the ADX? You attempting to put something very lagging with something very leading? What peroid you using for ADX?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
14, I really like the adx. You think its to slow for 1 hour ?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
so it works best on 1 hr or higher? which pair or pairs? thanks fred

--- 帖子 #15 ---
ADX14 is ok on every timeframe. But it is hard to find anything more lagging than MA crosses. MA 100x200 especially.

WE are not trading the 100/200 cross , we are only using it for bias. WE are trading the 5/10 cross.

Missed the cross on the GBP/USD, but I think it will continue to move south.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Quick note, I try to shoot for 1to 1 or 1to 2, but if I am up in pips I will not allow a big pull back. I watch the MA's closely and get what I can. Even on the daily charts

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hello Fred, right now I'm trading all pairs with this, and yes right now I recommend trading 1 hour or higher.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
The ideal trade is a 5/10 cross with the 100/200 both pointing up or down.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Attached Image Tip, when looking at the ADX, look to see how far the DMI's are apart

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Why don't you cherry pick your trades according to this rule? You say you are trading all pairs, how much exactly?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBP/USD just triggered, let see what it does. notice the double top

--- 帖子 #29 ---
What do you mean by cherry pick ? I trade what ever looks good to me.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
GBP/USD news at 4:30 using aggressive stops.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I mean, scan all pairs and trade only the very best setup according to you rule. That's why I aslo asked how many pairs you trade.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here we go !!!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I do , I scan all pairs and look for the best setup

--- 帖子 #34 ---
How about your last GBPUSD trade? Not ideal, since the cross took place a couple of hours earlier.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZD/CAD I'm concerned, I don't have a problem with shutting this down. 5MA is still domeint and we still have good separation on the ADX

--- 帖子 #36 ---
That why i used a pending order, I said rules will sometimes get broken.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
To elaborate further, I like that trade because the 100/200 were both slanting downward. The candles also looked aggressive to the downside. The adx is now very strong to the downside.

Also news at 8:30

--- 帖子 #57 ---
i think this did not crossed yet when you entered. Am i wrong?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You would be correct, I jumped the gun on that and paid for it, but it did eventually cross, I just didn't have the patience. I really should not have taken that trade due to the 100MA leaning downward

--- 帖子 #59 ---
AUD/JPY still holding -7 100 and 200 MA's still look good.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Traco1, l should think you said you have closed for today.Sorry to say you seem to be inconsistent and over trading.You must be careful of such habits so that you don't throw back into the market your hard earned pips.Just an advise.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks AJE I will take it under advisement.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) I saw this setting up, this is a rule breaker trade. I like this because the 100 MA is bending over , I think this may be a runner. Could be wrong

--- 帖子 #63 ---
The best statement for a long time here in the forum, Rtm! Moving Average is all you need, when you use indicators. Green pips for you, traco1 ! And let the things simple !

Hi, i have tested it on EUR/USD from 2014.01.01 to 2014.08.01 on hystory. I do not understand what is your t/p, so i used a strategy of a robot that is put 3 orders based on the history of the currency, according to my experiments is 200,350,500 for eurusd, s/l is 300. Usually i do not use my time on sites / forums, but seeing the results I thought it is right to to share my test with the author, now I'll run the test on all currencies in this way, i hope my approach with this strategy can be tested and evaluated by other people bringing some more gain. Buy We need a cross of the 5 above the 10 we also need the 100 to be above the 200. ADX &gt;25 Only the first intersection after the other should not be taken into consideration* Sell We need a cross of the 10 above the 5 we also need the 200 to be above the 100. ADX &gt;25 Only the first intersection after the other should not be taken into consideration* *what I mean is that you have to be very strong approaching the strategy, just like a robot, if the two lines intersect but ADX is for example about 24, and after two candles rises to&gt; 25 the order is not taken in consideration. EURUSD H1: 3 Orders: 200: Close. + S/L at 0 for 350 e 500. 350: Close. 500: Close.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks, I cant wait for your results. I do know that the 5/10 cross was voted as on of the best mechanical systems on BP but we know that this market now you have to improvise a little. Forex market is tough.

Im not going to wait for it to hit, thats almost 30 pips, if a move does not go my way I will get out of the trade.

Hi traco1 I noticed the Lime Green Candle on the right side of your chart , would you mind sharing that indi Thanks

--- 帖子 #131 ---
soon will be more signals on H1

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Well Max, you know I have to be correct, never risk more than 2% of your account per trade. But......if I feel good about a setup I will go in a little heavy, the reason why I said 15 pips on this pair is because I don't like this pair, also I never close positions all the way, so for this position I will take off 75% of the trade, move to BE and just let it run like I did yesterday.

Taking 20@75% eur/chf moving to BE Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) For this we wait for moving average to move out side of channel, sometimes you can anticipate the move , the MACD histogram must be outside the boundaries of the signal line to take a trade, and idealy the lag should be coming down from 45 area, this time it does not have to be over or under 45 for by or sell.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) I had a pending order at the first arrow, notice the macd, the adx is at the bottom candle, you cant see it I just keep it scrunched up.

I knew eur/usd was going to do that but.....

Apologize if this has been addressed. Do you have an alert for this, I saw two alert MA cross indicators for the thread, not sure if you use both of them..

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Yes i thought it would be nice to add a alert to the cross, but the one I posted is a little buggy, I dont really use it. The 15 Min strategy even has a alert but I cant located it. Maybe you can find it. http://www.forexstrategiesresources....d-ema-channel/

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Not sure if your interested in codifying your strategy into an alert indicator/ea, but the guy on my profile does work extremely cheap, bet you could get this going on all pairs for about $40

--- 帖子 #271 ---
better day today i hope

Attached Image (click to enlarge) EDIT : Let me edit this, I dont want to be accused of anything . You dont need the range indi, i just use it for visual reasons which I will explain. Ive added the 7sma and the TDI,as always looking for better ways to trade. I hate the TDI but it is actually a good indicator. also we have a 1 min chart with a range indicator. (will explain at a later time) but having good results. trying to put together a video, hopefully soon.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I like the range indi, why not use adx?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Dont really need it

--- 帖子 #283 ---

If you have a small account, put your stop at 20 pips, the reason for this is because with this strategy on this TF you will most of the time get 20 pips, this way your ratio will be at lease 1:1, go to BE at 20 and put in TS at 30, dont worry about taking some off. You will build the account in the long run.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
If you get stopped out, you get stopped out, just look for other opportunities at lease you will not have a lost.

Bad day today

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Bad day today ?? In your case Id say bad 139 days in a row. Thats stable the wrong side . I really don´t wanna tease you , may be a higher timeframe with a fix SL and TP is the solution for you . Good luck with handling it , Guido

--- 帖子 #303 ---
And?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I dont get it

--- 帖子 #306 ---
it was a little humor on my part (age test that was from Dude Where's My Car), so what came of trying to do daily with hourly entries? btw you took that last guy's comment very well, it's a learning experience right? I like your concept, it reminds me of the guppy MMA, and it helps a little bit with filtering the trends. Since I am American I am not allowed to hedge my trades so I thought about trading your idea as a straddle for options in order to play both sides. The reason why I like options is you can see where price is going with regards to open interest and volume, which is easier to spot BIG MONEY hedging their bets since majority of options trades are hedges by the institutions. I think that has more of an effect on price action than anything.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Like I said before, these guys don't bother me, they can say whatever they want to say, Its a good strategy .

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I am experimenting with options, but I have not had any success with it.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I would like to use this strategy with vertical credit and bull spreads . Find the trend for the week, and sell a spread on the opposite side of the price. Could get about 4-8% a week. I would have to use ETF's like SPX, SPY, GLD, SLV, but as far as currencies go I would be trading only FXE (eurusd) average volume is 1.2 million per day. I would like to propose a partnership, use your system on FXE (have a platform for etf's?), post alerts here, I will enter the options trades and we can see how they work out in addition to the currency trading going on here. Btw, I don't understand why people dont go to zulu some guy has there has been on there for 2 years, and his account so far this year is up over 1000%, I would just trade his signals...thought about using his for options trading

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Dont know to much about etf's but ok, Im always looking for new ways to trade.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thank you. you know this indicator better then me so is it possible to change color of that day bar?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I dont think so

--- 帖子 #313 ---

Had to martingale that last one

--- 帖子 #318 ---
such a dangerous tactic, I often use it for craps after I see a string (18) of non-performers (1 of the 3 dozen columns), start off slow, 10, 10 again because its 2:1. Then it starts to lift off from there; 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2500 (table cap). That is giving a 1 out 3 shot 28 times to make it, its gotta hit!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Ha ha ha Your statement is " politically correct" Mr Empty, but politically correct does not pay the bills. Martingale works when applied correctly, and is no where near a casino environment. But thanks for the comment.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
if the linked trade explorer is a system. Reverse it... may be profitable in this case.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I think its the worst posted is it not ? Your DEMO is impressive, but mines is live. Watch it go from negative to positive Miss.
